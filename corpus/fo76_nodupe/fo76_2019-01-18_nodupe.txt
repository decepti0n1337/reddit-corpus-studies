I wouldn't hold out hope.

---
She violated the games ToS and that gives Bethesda 0 reason to reverse that ban. 
---
---
---
Much appreciated, online now if you want to nab 'em
---
Limits power attacks, limits vats lock attacks, limits your ability to close the distance and run at an enemy. P.S. if you cant run up to someone thats shooting you, you do 0.00Damage with melee. Also did you know that melee has something called, attack speed? and that it effects the amount of damage you do. ITs to counter the Reload speed. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's actually 15 damage, although if you mod it to use cells the damage drops quite a bit.
---
I scrapped it for plastic, that's its true value...
---
I really wanted to use a crossbow in the game but the ammo seems so scarce. Do you just craft it all?
---
I just hit lvl 50 and have not picked a card for the last 6 levels. I'm not 100% sure where I want to put the perks yet and would be all for being able to change my choices later. 
---
I’m thinking about thos caps
---
Me to, i think they should decrease the damage only in pvp, if 1 shot does 50 dmg, 2 shot should do 100, period. And the majority of people don't care for pvp in this game.
---
You are vilified by Reddit for your monstrous crime of having free will 
---
Go to the Watoga train station and check mods there. Go to the top of the high school. Go visit Phoenix.
---
You'll have a set of T60 with Shocks several other mods pretty quickly.
---
Are they universal? Can be used for any power armor?
---
yeah that's my point, keep on them about the ticket, make sure you tweet @fallout and support until it is resolved, it is likely mistaken identify .. if she has a number after her gt, maybe they got the number wrong or a letter wrong and was a typo, banned the wrong account, you know what they morons are like.
---
They should also change the recoil/aim debuff that two-shot does, reduce the debuff by 75%
---
I feel ya on the two shot point. My favorite rifle is now junk. TSE dupers ruined it...
---
She bought an item for cash? 
---
That ban ain't getting over turned.
---
Agreed!  As for solo vs team, I think the requirement to land a hit on mobs (particularly legendaries) dissuades team play.  Would prefer that everyone in an event gets access to legendary drops if not all drops.  This would make it much more fun to encounter other players at events, even if it encourages some leeching.  XP sharing doesn’t matter here, it’s all about the legendaries!
---
I don’t understand how though? She didn’t duplicate anything
---
Ah follow up question never seen a traveling vendor bot in my 62 levels does it have a route i can intercept it at or is it luck based? Do you happen to know good sir 
---
that’s why I said it should only be max 20 per hour, also another guy suggested it gives you cola syrup that you could use to craft nuka colas, so no free caps
---
Nope. Just realized what you were asking. What PA set are you wanting shocks for?
---
Its because ppl are bored and caps are worthless
---
Its 9 for me 
---
Yes, this.  We need to have something to do with all these useless cards.
---
Well, maybe 240K isn't enough damage. If not stacked bobbleheads then there is another exploit that allows one-shotting someone not in PvP to happen. I'm not the only one that has experienced it and reported it here in Reddit.
---
Yeah I fast travel pretty much everywhere I go haha. All my armor has weapon weight reduction on it and I run most weight perks. I'm over 1,600 pounds with everything off 
---
So you wanted him to instead? Uh, wtf.
---
Do it no one on this server wanted them. I literally want to die, I'm just sleeping.
---
No? she bought for caps lol
---
I don't think this will change anything about the fact that two shot explosive will be the most powerful combination of legendary traits and the soul scourging grind of getting them hasn't been addressed.
---
Smart perk choices then 
---
Touted as a key feature?
---
The first info about pvp was how they want to stop griefers and protect pve ppl.
---
Far from a key feature
---
Explosive is actually far more powerful than two shot is.
---
With two shot, you are just doing double damage.
---
With explosive, you are doing double damage. But then you get your weapon damage perks and that brings both the bullet and explosive damage up.
---
Then you get the explosive damage perks and it doubles the explosive damage.
---
It seems stupid that they are nerfing two shot. They should instead be making it so the two cannot be on the same weapon AND stopping the explosive damage perk cards from increasing damage of the explosive effect. 
---
Then the two legendary perks will be on par in terms of single target damage, but explosive will be better for aoe.
---
My flying gourds are the best in all of West Virginia, no contest.
---
I can't tell if I'm being downvoted because people don't understand how legendary rolls work, people are pissed this would mean more explosive weapons or people are pissed because I want their explosive weapons nerfed even more.
---
Smart man/wo

---
Lol @smamrminess.  I'm just telling you from my personal experience PvPing melee builds as a Sniper build hasn't been onesided.  That's just my personal experience, I'm not talking down to you...
---
Then dont play that mode.
---
This is roughly where you want to drop it, basically you want the edge of the nuke zone as close to Prime as you can so that she spawns, but you have heaps of room to fight without having to be in Power Armour or hazmat suits.
---
[https://imgur.com/MCaQEUe](https://imgur.com/MCaQEUe)
---
In that position you can use the BoS site roof as a good area for ranged, which also also lets them effectively ignore the blue spray attack she does, heaps of room for her to land, and you can also shoot her from the roof of the barn if you want.
---
The fence around the BoS site is also good for crowd control on mobs.
---
Easy fix - remember GTA V? Someone destroys your insured car and the money came out of their pocket. So stop with the ineffectual wanted status and instead charge the CAMP destroyers for the repair costs.
---
I've got your back. Pretty sure he was just hoping the evidence didn't exist.
---
He's a random, but there is a way to get him to spawn. I quick Google search should get you to it!
---
Who knows. 
---
They could have been banning an account listing items and looking at who they recently played with/added to friends and traded with? 
---
That's just speculation tho.
---
Enclave bunker is only place for those but good luck. You’ll be server hopping for hours to find them. 
---
The massive bonsues to damage resistance, mods which provide large strength bonuses and inherit rad don't seem to be factored in by you. Are you seriously arguing that melee builds are overpowered?
---
Double damage was always what two shot did, why stop that now?
---
Quit whining, your gun was ridiculously OP. Get over it as this isn't even up for debate.
---
I know it's probably been mentioned but the solution to TSE is separate the TS and E. Let me run with an Explosive Mini-gun and a Two-Shot Minigun but not a Two-Shot Explosive Mini-gun. TSE will still be OP because the stacking of perks cards - just less damage now. Oh well. They'll still be one-shot kill range, and wreck the chance of random groups tackling the Queen successfully.
---
There are chickens, they are just fairly rare, as chicken noodle soup is actually pretty good food wise

It’s shitty as fuck but that’s really the fairest option for every single person. Like it’d be super unfair to some people and perfectly fair to others but the scales would basically balance. And people would get over it and most of the people that have done a lot of duping would learn their lesson. But I don’t see them ever doing a wipe 
---
Then I'm not sure. 
---
Pretty sure I got them from a treasure map before. If anybody is sitting on those I recommend doing them as I got tons of plans I never had from maps that were on me for a while.
---
K. Thought so. I have been server hopping a while already lol
---
8, or 13-16 with super duper proc if it decides to count after the ammo craft perk does, it's really weird, some times it does, some times it doesn't
---
umm.... I have 5 points so my melee doesn't break. I like it.
---
Watch the SBQ go from losing a fraction of her health a minute while flying, to losing 10% or more a second while being wailed on by folks with supersledges before you step into the big kids pool.

It's not as exciting as it sounds (not like deathclaw sanctuary in fo3) the island has A deathclaw on it. 
---
Thanks!  As much as I love spending time finding good weapons and doing quests, I want to spend time looking damn cool while I do it.
---
[removed]
---
I dunno, the 2 shot modifier essentially doubled DPS for a weapon. That to me seems too much. Some weapons especially benefitted to absurd degrees with just the second shot modifier. 25% extra damage is still going to make two shot weapons with the right affixes more powerful than just about any other variant of that weapon, same for explosive, but without outclassing everything by a huge margin.
---
TS is an issue by itself that E exacerbates. The problem with the two is that TSEmakes almost any other combination of weapons worthless in comparison, and either part of TS/E are leagues ahead of anything else available for those slots
---
Furious adds like 10% damage per hit, stacking for a bit... Or TS doubles it every hit.
---
Instigating adds +100% on the first hit, TS doubles every hit.
---
Armor piercing supposedly adds about 25% damage... TS doubles damage
---
Enemy specific weapons add +30%... TS doubles it
---
Suppressor's reduces damage taken, but TSE clears the area fast enough that is almost irrelevant outside the queen
---
It's the same thing with the Explosive side. It doubling damage is better than any fire rate increase, even without the perks for it. 
---
This Nerf makes the two effects on par with other options available. Now, they will be generally effective but other weapon options won't be useless in comparison. Some will be situationally better. 
---
This is why we need Phoenix to clean up these streets!
---
Thank you , never used that before
---
You trying to pull me into a Mexican stand off?
---
I don't believe this is true. I've server hopped a plan spawn for hours that also spawns a magazine and a cap stash. I've found them all in various combinations repeatedly. An hour of hopping usually yields 2-3 magazines, 4-5 cap stashes, and several sets of THE WRONG PLANS! \*yelling cursing throwing things\*
---
Yep, I legit two-shot lever action, and now its value will only be marginally higher than a non-legendary.
---
The only reason they are "balancing" them is to radically slow player progression.
---
 
---
I'm sure they didn't change TSE weapons because the player base was crying about them being op, it's because you kill stuff too fast.
---
The fact that it framed as a balance no one asked for shows it's just to nerf player power.
---
Next up will be mutations and builds that deal with crazy compound stats like that bloodied build that hits for 6k...
---
Few hours a day for like a week to get both for mine. It takes a while or a blessing from RNGesus. 
---
&gt; You’ll be server hopping for hours to find them.
---
Hours? Try weeks or more. Day 1 PC beta player, and I've found every single X01 mod I want, but not one single XO1 shock. Four fucking jetpacks clogging up my stash, and another few eaten for scrap by the game...but no calibrated shocks.
---
xbox, and no other issues at all. can play other games completely fine, used to play fallout 76 fine last week. Only this week when it updated i been having issues. 
---
No, no, no.  PSA means Problem Solution Approach, where you describe a problem and how to solve it.
---
Thank you
---
Lol. Same for lever action rifle plans
---
Yeah 2 shot is not the problem without explosive. Explosive is also not a problem without two shot. It’s like the devs don’t understand aggregate effects.
---
Correcting, melee makes guns useless. This game is a melee fest, they could just remove guns already. If a person rathers use guns they should look for another game. I amazed that a game can be this busted and they are still trying to make It worse.
---
&gt; threw-out
---
🤔
---
Thanks , I don’t do a ton of team based online gaming so I don’t have online friends to party up with. 
---
Thanks for the advice 
---
I think they should drop legendary weapons and just make it all mods like how the scorch killer effect is a mod 
---
let us pick and choose the mods and make legendary enemies drop high quality crafting goods we use to mod our own weapons and armors rather then this random hope I get something thing 
---
like if we had clips with 50% armor piercing legendary effect or explosive - maybe a 2 shot armor piercing rifle sounds good to a sniper but a close in character wants a explosive clipped shotgun 
---
would remove the grindy nature of the game give us more options more customization and balance out some of the late game random effects of just loot charts hating on some people 
---
My char is lvl 51 rifleman and I never had an ammo issue throughout the game. I find it really easy to acquire steel, lead and gunpowder and then use the ammo perk in agility + super duper in LCK to create ammo. I'm always running around with a minimum of 2.000 bullets for every gun. Furthermore, after lvl 40 - 45 the pve has become extremely easy, even though my handmade, hunting rifle and lever action aren't legendary. I wouldn't be able to defeat the Queen alone, but I can win the workshop defence events where 3 scorchbeasts attack you at once. I'm really surprised someone like you, with much stronger weapons has apparently been struggling so much and says this change is game-breaking for pve.
---
Regarding two shot I agree though. I tried my first two shot (pipe-bolt action rifle) today after I had hit lvl 50 and didn't feel much stronger than my non-legendary handmade and other guns.
---
I’ll do that 3*  trapper for 100 caps in 4 hours
---
I totally agree. Feels like the solution is just to make slap damage zero and not change legendary effects.
---
That being said, if youre thinking of putting the game down, I'd try melee first. Sure it makes you a club wielding troll but you'll never have to craft ammo and it makes PVE a whole lot easier, bar scorchbeasts
---
Having it take glass and fruit and a bottle cap would actually be pretty cool and it would take them like 0 thought and be a great detail
---
Oh cool yet another person with a TSE,  great.
---
Totally not tired of seeing them everyfuckingwhere.
---
its all up to RNG-esus lol..ive had the same rare plans respawn after only 2 server-hops
---
Tse shotgun, in order to shred most mobs or players, * requires* nothing but the shotgun. If you want to maximize it, sure max out demo and take a few points of damage perks.
---
Unarmed, in order to treat through most players or mobs, needs max strength, 9-12 strength perks, multiple mutations, max class freak, starched genes to manage the mutations. In order to get that 1000+ damage people keep talking about, you need more missions, a bloodied gauntlet, multiple pieces of unyielding armor, and you have to run around with basically no hit points, while charging straight into incoming fire.
---
Has happened to me at least three times since most recent update. 
---
Meaning I’ll buy it from you for that in 4 if you like 
---
Which is why they nerfed the explosive too....
---
I'm literally looking at 9 damage right now.
---
Two shot is not the problem.  Multiplicative explosive damage and bobble-head stacking is the problem.  Pretty douche move to ruinbat my 1\* two shot rifle collection after not giving me enough inventory space to keep all the anti-armor/instigating/furious weapons I threw out to make room for them.  Thanks Bethesda.
---
And they shouldn’t care in pve...
---
Anything other than T-60 will be a pain to get Calibrated Shocks for.
---
The plans for 51b shocks are only available through Phoenix (who can also sell T-60 shocks), X-01 shocks are only available through MODUS (and are a very rare item even there), and Ultracite shocks are only available as a mod plan in the loot table for Scorchbeasts (and even there, the Queen is the only one guaranteed to drop any plans at all, let alone the shocks).
---
T-45 and Raider armors also have Calibrated Shocks, but since the Watoga vendors have a high chance of having T-60 mods, those two lower-grade armors aren't really even worth farming the shocks for.
---
No biggish, I'll hold on to them for ya, added your GT
---
whew, nah, i accidently fucked up some turrets. someone finally got the message to just shoot me in bed. thanks kind stranger. also left me some nuka cola and a vampire radium. enjoy those caps!
---
&gt; Even Anti-armor would be more preferable
---
To be frank, anti armor is garbage. I've done a lot of experimentation with it and it doesn't stack well with armor pen perk cards. In fact, most of the time I did 0 extra damage with armor pen vs a normal item. Maybe it's bugged or maybe I was fighting mobs with no armor to speak of. Idk I figured a deathclaw would have plenty of armor.
---
As for the trade off of damage vs accuracy, totally depends on your weapon and typical damage range. Yes its garbo for sniper rifles and to a lesser extent auto rifles and pistols, but shotgunners and heavy gunners wont really give a fuck. Honestly the only ones heavily affected by the accuracy thing are sniper or vats builds and if you're using TS for vats, you're a silly goose.
---
Yes, but things in the wasteland seem to be pretty clever, and well, you can instantly tame mirelurk kings to be guard dogs by lookin' at em funny
---
Maybe the real issue with melee is enemy AI. Not like much goes into wailing on an enemy. If I can stand next to a Scorchbeast and beat the piss out of it using All Rise and only the 3 base two-handed perk cards, I don’t think that’s an issue with melee being OP.
---
Love this. All these crybabies today need to see this thread.
---
Happened to me too. Idk about the disapearnon death tho 
---
odd, my gat las gets through at least 3 full cores without issue, my gat plas is the one that explodernates with use
---
so?
---
Why are you here? Just to suffer?
---
I agree.. but it has no bearing on admitting how broken a game is.. or at least, it shouldn't.
---
I’ll be in bed by that point lol! But I won’t go as low as 100 Caps. How does 300 Caps sound?
---
I’m going to have to get my chameleon armor back on and get the sneaks to increase my damage output I stopped after I got good TSE rifles
---
[Feedback]
---
Regarding the incoming nerf to the most fun weapons available. 
---
Is there any way the nerfs could be exclusive to PVP only?
---
As most, if not all the outrage from over powered TSE weapons came from being shot with them, it feels like I as a pure PVE player is being punished for something I didn't even do. 
---
The solution would be simple: 
---
 - Make the nerfs only count towards PVP. It doesn't hurt anyone that I can save them quickly with good weapons, or that I blast deathclaws into pieces. 
---
 - Make PVP completely optional. Unless both players have agreed, or are on workshop property, we shouldn't be able to damage each other at all. 
---
I worked long to build up my characters stats. I'm level 185, and am doing a heavy gun build. I agree that TSE are too powerful, and could use a small nerf, but an overall damage reduction of 80% is WAY too much. If I am a high level player, I should be able to easily dispense with enemies at level 50-60. That is what the good legendary weapons are for, but now you are going to take the only worthy end game reward away. 
---
It is pretty detailed it has 544 pages.
---
I think it's worth it definitely for this price.
---
I could not find this anywhere online in digital form.(for free)
---
Did they just announce this today? 🤔
---
That'd be like a DLC focused on introducing Cliff Racers to Skyrim.
---
This is wholesome AF and you are all awesome. Keep up the amazing work!!   
---
same.
---
Any idea where the Engineer's Uniform is found?
---
I should go through and count the number of posts today complaining about the two-shot nerf. It's every other post at this point. 
---
Im on PS4 and im experiencing crashes all the time. Ive just had one where i legit crashed 10 seconds after spawning. This is ridiculous. How could this become worse after the patch? Ive uninstalled and reinstalled and nothing has worked. Im so frustrated as it seems no one else ( or at least not a majority) is having this issue 
---
I also don't believe this is true. If that were the case my friends and I would never find loot anywhere when we play together compared to when we don't. Such a complicated method of loading in loot would also stress the server quite a bit more as every time a player loaded onto a server or zone, it would have to calculate loot in various ways and then load it. It would make far more sense to simply load loot once a server is created. I suspect people are farming common routes for junk and plans and simply hitting areas that have already been looted. 
---
glad they clarified that it's opt in. I don't mind pvp but a free for all was not the game they sold.
---
I mean, I really wish pvp wasn't a complete cheese-fest. 
---
Melee one shots you, exp shotguns one shot you, vats hs sr one shots you. If you don't get one shot then you can almost outheal anything else. And maxed out legendary sentinel assassin armor can render you completely immune to everything if you grind long enough to get it.
---
In order to have a fun and engaging time in pvp both players essentially agree to gimp themselves to an unorthodox degree, there simply is no legitimate way to have the type of shootouts shown in the trailers with both players having a chance and back and forth gameplay. This isn't unique to this game, but the pve balance exacerbates the normal issues to extremes.
---
Players can't get reasonably high defensive stats, otherwise hostile creatures become a nonissue, but have to scale to fight higher level enemies, meaning run away damage output scaling relative to defense. I main tank, but you can't really be a tank in this game, it's glass cannon or nothing.
---
Happy Cake day, bot!
---
Even SBQ could be made better by having to keep AA batteries repaired in order to keep her grounded. Keep the batteries defended from the adds while another team lays into the queen. I'd much prefer that over the current fight with just waves of adds and tons of health with no real mechanics. 
---
It means I am a kid

+agi, +20% weapon weight reduction.  
---
Nope. Nerf the everloving shit out of it. 
---
No.
---
ive been server hopping two areas with armor plan spawns, and about once a day i go to the overseers camp and leave an entire set of marine plan dupes in the overseers stash.
---
Are you saying that twisted muscles affects non-melee weapons?  The description does seem ambiguous: 
---
&gt; *+25% melee damage and increased chance to cripple enemy limbs*
---
...could be construed as referring to either melee only, or all weapons.
---
Or, did you type twisted muscles when you meant marsupial?
---
Wont happen. Was the source of the trade stealing rumor. The lowest common denominator here are the players mashing the trade button and selling their weapon off for 0 caps.
---
If you wanna go quick, try bags. Sucks, but it's a new safety break.
---
‪They should be dealing with the bobble head stacking glitch before nerfing Any weapons ... and then check game balance as a results on the Queen without players doing 100k plus damage on it with stacked bobble heads ‬
---
It would be 5/4ths shot wouldn't it?
---
2 shot on it's own was not ever op.  
---
2 shot + explosive, and also explosive on shotguns in general are the 2 cases that were clearly broken.  SG's are still broken after this fix it's just less insane.  Still, because shotguns get the explosive effect PER PELLET they will deal more damage per shot than rifles/pistols/etc. did pre nerf.
---
You're not like an idiot. I had the same on my main, so do my friends and I suspect many players. It's pretty easy to change though as you level up. I personally enjoy starting new specialized characters, but most of the ppl I play with rather keep working on their main character.
---
Hi Bethesda people!
---
Here's my answers to your questions!
---
Q: Which events do you feel are most rewarding to you?
---
A: The ones that always give me plans. 
---
Q: Which events do you not care about doing? Why? 
---
A: Currently the Feed the People event. I'm not helping my server anymore by completing it and the hopper has stolen items from me. 
---
Q: Which events to you prefer to play in a team vs. Solo? Why? 
---
A: Anything involving a Scorchbeast. Because their screech spam is terrible. Especially if there's more than one. 
---
Q: What types of events would you like to see in the game? 
---
A: A more consistently rewarding Scorchbeast Queen encounter. Sometimes there's next to nothing. Sometimes a plan. 
---
Also make Technical Documents stack. The more you turn in at once, the more likely you are to get a plan. 
---
Q: How do you join events? Do you fast travel? Do you go to a location expecting to start an event? 
---
A: I join events mostly by fast traveling to them. I don't typically expect to start them unless it's Poseidon, Monamana (do doo do do do!) or Thunder Mountain. I'd like to see a timer near each event on the map or even a tab with timers. 
---
for all events 
---
Q: How would you feel about bonuses for completing a daily or weekly event? 
---
A: Don't we already have this to get atoms? Are we talking about some other type of bonus? I'd like to see a consumable, attainable in game through gameplay, that gives you a better chance at receiving rare plans for a certain amount of time or at your next event completion. 
---
I hope you like my answers!
---
both 2 shot and explosives weapons separately were fine and werent even OP, it was the combination together that was super OP and even then you still needed some perk cards for it to really make it decent. but beth being dumb as usual
---
It is the Least rare gun in the game now. Thats why.
---
&lt;With this patch, will Two Shot guns be renamed to One and a Quarter Shot guns? Doesn't make much sense for a weapon that shoots an entire extra bullet to do any less damage than the same amount of damage as the other bullet. If I have a single fire weapon like a hunting rifle that normally does 100 damage, firing a 2nd bullet should do 200 damage, and increase of 100% damage. However if I have a 4 shot weapon like the Dragon and it does 400 damage (100 per each of the 4 balls), the 2shot variant should fire a 5th ball for 500 damage, which would be +100% the damage of a single balls, or +25% the overall damage. Basically the extra bullet/ball should do the full extra damage of a single extra round being fired.
---
Wahhhh.

Pretty sure I find weapons with crippling (+50% limb damage) all the time.

And last night good ol Grahm came along with moo moo too. Got some brick building plans. I just need to stop being perpetually encumbered because it’s a long walk. 
---
I think Bethesda was thinking that people would focus on the queen once they found TSE, But instead, they are still fucking around at events like Uranium fever one shot killing everything and preventing others from looting legendary mole miners. Same at White Springs. 
---
Once I found a TSE  Mingun that could do decent damage on the queen, I personally didn't care about events and white springs anymore.   I felt like I had the tools I needed and didn't need to farm anymore. 
---
Not the case with most people it seems.
---
Upvoting for visibility.
---
I'm at level 100 now and have been trying to correct some serious flaws in my build for the past ~15-ish levels (I was a sneaky sniper who invested *way* too many points into STR). The nerfs to EXP gain through farming Whitesprings has made that process even more tedious than ever.
---
I'm going to need at *least* another 15-20 levels to fix my character build, and as I don't have the time to play 20 hours every single day it'll probably take weeks of tedious grinding to fix that. 
---
If you need some brick. I can build some for you. What platform 
---
less and less, it would seem :(
---
&gt; Dont care for the Messenger quests but others like them

I can't believe anyone enjoys that rubbish, even if the bot doesn't get stuck on a pebble until the server goes down.  He takes forevvverrrr to get where he's going and the reward is a pittance.

In thousand cuts, near Brick's "base" there's a side mission where a psycho (face mcshooty) tells you to shoot him in the face, and that's it mission complete haha. I always try and leave that mission for the end of my playtime that day and try and kill him in a "creative" way. If it takes more than 20 attempts though I'd usually just leave it till the next day. 
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
I think it's fine, they are super op and needed nerfed into the ground. 
---
My suggestion is better: Eliminate all the two shot explosive weapons entirely and award any players that had one of them atoms and caps as compensation 
---
Anyone who has more than one identical twins shot explosive gets a perma-ban.
---
And still nerf the two shits and explosive weapons that are left.
---
They need to nerf the things that are op and buff the things that are weak on an individual basis. They already did across the board buffs to automatics that still left the LMG near useless but also made the Gatling gun uncharacteristically powerful. If they nerf melee across the board I’m going to really boned since I’m using brass knuckles and a lot of of other melee users are as well. 
---
And once again, Who is to blame for all this? If The dupers didn't dupe thousands of these weapons and then those people who got a hold of them decided to use the weapons like normal and not for malicious reasons we wouldn't be in this mess. The gun would still do what it does, but would be a rare occurrence of people trolling with them.
---
They need to make it like chems you get 1!
---
Its the game developers job to keep cheaters from cheating. I dont blame the people who are utilizing the system at all. They know Bethesda doesn't give a shit. Any reasonable dev would have already pulled the game offline and rolled it back and then put in protective measures.
---
At this point if Bethesda is going to fix the game they'll need to do a full server wipe.
---
Yep, totally spaced on my fractions.
---
If you find a 3-star legendary enemy, and there are people in the vicinity (or it is an event like Uranium Fever), it's helpful when players use the come here emote so that other players can share the loot. I usually use my Auto Tesla Rifle for this purpose because I usually take everything out in one hit with my instigating super sledge.
---
What about Big Shot :)
---
Explosive is still going to be heads above the rest.
---
No affixes in its pool will increase damage by 20% and for 5 perk points it doubles to 40%
---
Two shot will have competition now and that's a good thing
---
I believe it's possible to obtain from turning in technical data
---
If you arnt supposed to be able to why have perks that reduce weight by 90% and have armor that can reduce weapon weights by 90% when stacked?
---
As you can see from my post history, you can see I'm very much against TSE weapons. 
---
With recent updates to Fireproof and the dense mods, they're really no longer too big a threat in PvP when used legitimately, which I love.
---
That said, I do want to try to make the argument against nerfing them even more since they've already been massively crippled. They're still a bit OP in PvE and should be tuned down, but not made completely useless. 
---
What weapons were nerfed?
---
I agree. It’s hard to believe they haven’t considered using factions when it comes to pvp, so here’s to hoping. 
---
I was hoping for a bustling faction home base, and then battlegrounds or “combat zones” on different parts of the map, or anything like that really lol
---
Bethesda..please add the GIFT emote!!! 
---
Yeah I’m getting the exact same thing on my one X. I’ve had it repeat sometimes up to 3 times a row. When I load in and even press y to jump it just goes crazy. Glad to see as bad as that sounds that I’m not the only one. Hopefully this gets addressed/fixed soon i literally gave up. Ended up playing some shenmue 2 hd lol
---
Oh, i dont care man 👍 message me your PSN
---
you get a fair amount back from the enemies but yea its mostly crafting, a lot of adhesive

welp
---
Weird, they are fixing it and didn't need a server wipe...
---
&gt;"They know Bethesda doesn't give a shit". 
---
This is resolved when they get those lovely personalized emails explaining that their accounts are locked, signed: Love Bethesda.
---
Make it so current explosive effect gets changed to a legacy version that doesn't drop anymore and then add a new explosive effect in the same tier as 2 shot
---
There are 5 in the basement of Vault-Tec Agricultural Research Center. There are also the 5 mentioned around the Slocum's Joe.
---
Meh. Damage modifier perks weren't necessary. I say you're lucky you still have them at all. 
---
Honestly two shot still giving a flat 25% damage increase is still going to make it a fantastic effect in my opinion. Leaps and bounds better than so many of the other effects.

Nerfing two shot isnt balancing anything. Its just making all the weapons I grinded for useless. Explosive I expected. The legendary drops suck so gtfo with that change your build find new weapons shit. Its not viable to do that at this point. 
---
Waah someone actually paid $60 for what they expected to be a fully working product.
---
Waah why does Bethesda still need to do major balance changes 2 months after release.
---
Waah why would anyone ever ask for anything better from an AAA developer/publisher?
---
5 years from now:
---
Waah why do all game companies try the same shit Bethesda did with Fallout 76 back in '18?
---
That's false.
---
Sqb doesnt have naturally high resistance to the gunsmith perk
---
No you first
---
it's funny because I don't think bethesda understands how their own game is balanced.  
---
2 shot was never op, it's only an issue when combined with explosive.
---
And shotguns get the explosive effect per pellet at 8 pellets per shot.  So doing the math before the nerf 
---
Rifles got 100% damage per shot from explosive and now after it's 20%.  
---
Shotguns got 800% (100% per pellet * 8 pellets) and post nerf still get 160% (20% * 8 pellets).
---
So if rifles were op at 100% damage boost how are post nerf SG's "balanced" now at 160% damage boost?!?
---
I mean yeah it was insane at 800% but there is a basic lack of understanding here.  For SG's to be balanced they need to have explosive effect deal the same amount of damage per shot instead of per pellet, so basically take the total damage boost, divide by 8, and then apply to every pellet and it's solved.
---
I wonder if the people making these balance changes playtest at all.
---
Can you reduce gun damage by 45% with 3 perk points?
---
Relate haha. Vats and jump don’t do anything but I see the AP bar drain. Wack
---
Even nerfed they will remain the strongest weapons. Perhaps some players who paid premium price for them
---
will try to get some caps which could lead to panic sales. For the rest the majority will stay in dupers stashes
---
TSE.
---
Counterpoint: It is totally viable to do that, and you will, and you will like it once this tantrum has passed.
---
If you want to be mad at someone, the cheaters and those who supported them by buying duped goods are where you want to set your aimbot.
---
I'd just love to see the state of other parts if thr world in the FO universe
---
No its not it removes all challenge from the game and makes it difficult to tag for others to tag legendaries. 
---
My shielded vault suit gives has a +1 to STR ANS +2 to everything else
---
Nope the fault lies with you dupers and players that used these weapons maliciously. End of story. Good riddance 
---
What r u on?
---
Random for you for that server. If you server hop, the items will change
---
I would agree except Bethesda released a game that invited these problems in the first place. Had they created a solid game I would feel a lot better about the situation. 
---
I use melee first and foremost, but I understand people who may have TSE weapons who will be disregarded. 
---
Honestly would rather a total reset than these nerfs. If they could stop duping 100% and make everything legit then I would 100% support a reset.
---
Dang I only have a explosive anti armor single action revolver
---
I'm guessing they'll add a new area based on a nuke cola amusement park where we can learn these...
---
Aight
---
Yeah both are getting nerfed.
---
You mean like the blocker perk? And what other damage resist do Melee characters get that you don't or cant get? Yea melee is OP but not nearly as much as TSE. Also you have to get Melee naturally where TSE are duped 90% of the time.
---
I would like to see more events that require more people. I still like ones you can solo, but that's all of them right now. (except the one with the 2 # pads I think)
---
Good I hope they realize its a stupid move.  I grinded a long time for my two shot shotgun (not explosive) now its shit.
---
I do treasure maps all the time, but I always get odd, cheap stuff from them, like crossbows, raider left leg, 10mm ammo, and other useless garbage. Very surprised to hear that.
---
How badly will the anti armor be nerfed 
---
I love you. Doing gods deeds.
---
Good luck with your accounts and getting a response, my recent two tickets haven't been given a reply and it's been weeks.
---
I don't need brick, that plan is not rare at all.
---
Hey Bethesda. Please make it so when we login, that we do not spawn inside a nuclear blast. Just send us to our camp or the next closest, non nuked area. Thanks.....
---
That's a good one! Its suitably vague and sounds fallout-y. It also makes me think of New Vegas, which isn't a bad thing.
---
Arnt they already greyed out if u dont have enough caps
---
I just want you guys to add more weight and more events or quests, kinda sucks all to do is events which only pop up every 45 minutes and aren't very rewarding. Oh and for the love of god please please make a scorchbeast worth fighting, they have an unlimited scream you take them down after 100s of rounds and not to mention several stimpacks, to just get a useless non legendary piece of armor and a heart or wing fragment. I've killed probably 40 and gotten two decent plans out of 40! Maybe in the future we can get a little more budget to build bigger houses, its like the main thing about the game is building something cool in your design. Other than that good job Bethesda and keep up the great work!
---
I don’t nor have I ever used two shot explosives or obtained modded gear as there would be nothing else to strive for and I stop entirely.
---
These nerfs are a knee jerk reaction to their own incompetence.
---
No the room where you fix the pipes. The door that you eventually exit out of can be picklocked as soon as you enter that room.
---
Wasnt that proven to be fake. It was user error. So now everyone has to struggle with stupid sliders resetting for a few people who traded incorrectly?
---
PC player here 450+ hours. 
---
The only reward I am interested in or need is the Queen event. The others have rewards I don't want/need.
---
I prefer to play with a teammate in general. It makes things easier and I use a few charisma team cards. 
---
Flashmob event. Nothing to fight.  Wear a specific outfit and show up at a marked location. Examples: Wear a cultist outfit to the lucky hole mine. Swimsuit to the pool at Whitesprings ex.. Hang out for the duration to get a stat bonus. Meet new people and get to trade and team up. 
---
Rebuild event. Another non fighting event. You show up to a group of idol construction bots in an otherwise empty area and get a list of junk items or scrap needed to get them to work. Event stays active til enough materials are gathered and then alerts all who particpated when it's ready. Would like to see something get made that has purpose like a greenhouse with two of every plant or a restaurant with a stove that cooks better food. Could also be a statue that you maybe get the plans to build in your own CAMP. 
---
Grinching event. You guessed it. Non fighting.  You ever see Super Market Sweep cause it's the same concept.  Have the tables in a certain closed door location spawn a bunch of stuff.  No option to break down junk til you leave the event in which case you can't reenter it. Reward is what you can carry away or maybe caps based on how much of the area you were able to clear. 
---
Pot luck event. Bring a food dish or beverages to a marked location and put in a container for a slight luck bonus. 
---
Feed the Birds event. Happens in the bog. Kill a group of creatures and moltov it to get the sweet smell lofting in the air. Draws the scorchbeasts away from other areas and they attack you for the mail more aggressively. 
---
Just a few ideas and I have TONS of em. 
---
I fast travel every time. 
---
I rarely see the daily events triggering. I just assumed they were still broke. For instance, I have not gotten the pumpkin house prompt for week and only a great once in awhile will a single Camden park trigger. 
---
What the hell does that even mean? I'm sorry but if you don't understand that 150% damage is the same as 150% durability i have nothing more to explain. You just can't do the math so i'm wasting my time.
---
Google doc :(
---
So that you can carry 10x more?
---
You know maybe the math technically works out but in general i've really just not been impressed by marine armor as talked up as they make it. I think there's a whole thread of people saying the same thing here somewhere.
---
I still one shot myself... Shotgun dgaf 🤣. I gotta remove some damage perks and keep it below 900ish for the combo to be effective
---
I saw the change. Thanks
---
Yup its so out of touch its unbelievable. Time for a break I think, im super angry about it.
---
Are they nerfing two shot as well?
---
You don't know anything about legendary armor than.
---
Yeah, but now it’s more in line with the other weapons. If you have a pump shotgun that does 150 damage a shot, it would do 217.5 instead of 600. 
---
Maybe if you understood literally anything about her resistances........ 300explosive resistance. Its because everyone is using TSE and expecting it to work, and not using legitimate rifle builds or shotgun builds to do damage. Also she is standing still on the ground making her an easier target for both melee and ranged. Many people dont even shoot at her in the air to save ammo. 
---
Was that enough point for you to understand the point you were failing to make or do you need me to explain even more about the fight mechanics you decided to not lean in exchange for an easy TSE purchase.
---
I have one piece. Weighs 0.00.
---
Yes u are. " With the lack of an actual story line" that means it lacks a storyline, which means it doesn't have one. 
---
Ive done it with over 1k damage and been fine
---
K. I still have fun with it so that’s cool
---
At first I was hoping for faction pvp and not seperate servers, but considering so many people in this community are already struggling with the super easy pve content and are very vocal that pvp'rs are some kind of evil people, this probably is the smartest course of action for retaining as many players as possible.
---
I've met several people shortly after launch IG who told me they always played fallout and other games with cheats. Later I meet others IG with a similar attitude who we're happy they could buy items from dupers (and cried loudly if they still would lose certain fights). I think I now wouldn't mind a server where I'm not bothered running into those attitudes.
---
Seems like making the boards to lag server gets u a ban
---
Are they though?
---
You said bloodied, not unyeilding/bolstering armor dumbass
---
Ig you want a game like that play warframe 
---
Nope
---
Total booty move lol
---
I have not played a online game in the last five years that didn't have exploits and glitches in the first three months. Some games will completely change major mechanics within the first 6 months because you can't figure everything out unless you are live with a massive user base.
---
Bethesda clearly set out in the ToS that exploits were abuse, hardly inviting it.
---
All will be fine, the game will go on, and nobody will care this even happened in two months.
---
I'm saying that raising explosive damage and forgoing durability is stupid when the sqb has high explosive resistance.
---
You're 150% is grearly watered down to much less than what gunsmith provides.
---
With one exception, the items that were sold to the vendor by players show up for everyone, and it’s first come first serve in that regard.
---
plz bro i will give you all my caps i and bobbleheads and my soul for this bro for real, ive been server hopping for 2 weeks on end and have only gotten the skeleton costume
---
Theres a lot more too :)
---
All games behave weirdly in dual box mode.
---
Raider vendor bot

---
I've never been more proud of a reddit post in my entire life....
---
Damn thanks! I hate that part so I guess I'll get the 3rd lockpicking card. Thanks!! 😀
---
You might have not done that (which we have no proof of), but many others have duped and trolled players endlessly with these weapons to the point of quitting. One good apple don't mean shit in a sea of bad ones.
---
the dragon shoots 4 projectiles at a time and the two shot only adds one more aka a dragon two shot shoots 5 projectiles
---
My husband and I have noticed that the items randomize per player too. So while playing together it'll show me one thing but it'll have something different for my husband. 
---
Explosive will now increase dmg by 20% instead of 100%
---
I enjoyed Fallout 4’s survival mode a lot with some mods. Enemies die in a reasonable amount of time and ammo. Headshots are fatal. However the same applies to you as well. I took my time in Fallout 4 and planned out encounters. Now I just run around with no fear and it legitimately sucks.
---
[Bull Shot?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQFBz3tp8YU)
---
I agree, it’s so annoying that I have over 9 makeshift warrior cards because I had a lvl 5 build then I used a lvl 4 build and now I’m on a lvl 3 build. I sure would love to try some of those QoL perks but I’m level 95 and haven’t finished my build yet because of this.
---
Thanks!
---
I said bloodied is better. It is. I didn't give any sort of context. Assume that everything that can, because it does in the game, will apply to buffing said effect.
---
I got minigun plan and crossbow 
---
There one of the few weapons that can drop as ledgendarys
---
Your a bitch
---
I'm not talking about the scorchqueen, just having demolition instead of gunsmith in general. Not all mobs have explosive resist.
---
Unfortunately if its not working for you and u are on PC u have to tweak it a bit to get to be stable.
---
This had been the case for nearly all bethesda games for me. They just dont work out of the box or if they do, its really poor.
---
Myself and a buddy were both one shot, outside of PVP. Neither of us had bounties at the time, and we were hanging out in the Watoga station just vending and breaking down/storing stuff.
---
No recording because I have all Xbox features off on my PC and OBS wasn't running at the time.
---
Only player I've ever blocked to date is this guy.
---
Got one from someone else, thanks though!
---
Easy - NERF Shot. ;)
---
i haven't received mine either. im very confused, as this was supposed to tide you over? but you cant tide some one ver with something that you don't have
---
As a stealth sniper, I 100% agree. And would like to add that they ought to make the events' and quests' icons that take up a huge portion of the top screen to be smaller and keep your stealth status viewable instead of having to wait for it to play out and see if you've been compromised.
---
Nah. Inventory/perk/item managment is key.
---
I did not know that. Thanks!
---
90% of my playtime is solo and despite the glitches, bugs and some toxic people, I still enjoy 76. The story on the other hand is definitely something this game is lacking. There isn’t much of it unless you enjoy holotape after holotape after holotape. 
---
Until next month, when you lot realize that everyone's just going to move the OP bar over to bloodied setups with unyielding armor.  
---
I mean, it's classic FOTM. When you as a developer don't really understand what your items do, and you have a pathetic excuse for a BETA...
---
I’ve been griefed once and I just hit level 90. 
---
99% of players I have encountered have been friendly, most of the time even supportive. 
---
The only issue I encounter regularly is higher level players one-shotting everything before I get a chance to tag the enemies. 
---
My advice would be just keep going. Eventually the griefing will subside. 
---
Same, also on xbox. I have to restart the game every time. 
---
I’ll keep that in mind. Just bought the lever action gun plans for 800 caps and now i’m broke :B
---
I did see that :)  Seems like a very reasonable fix they've come up with.  I won't even call it a nerf because it was broken af in the first place, never should have made past the first round of balance testing... assuming there was balance testing.
---
Two Shot is being removed from the pre fix pool. No more two shots. 
---
Oooh, I hope so!
---
I agree. I want pvp only characters and pve only characters
---
did u ever play XII? The RNG gods are tough in that game
---
Yet
---
Where did you find it?
---
More widespread than I thought it seems. Good and bad lol
---
Im saving all my saved Atoms for potential release of this, or a version of it.
---
Her damage and energy resistance are actually identical if you look at the datamined stats. Explosive resistance for mobs is a rumor and not backed up by any proof.
---
Stop making things up
---
Just forcing us to reply the game again would be fun
---
Yes please!
---
I think they then should hide your location on the map though, so that latecomers can progress more easily. And perhaps introduce an item that reveals players in a certain area. The higher the player level, the easier he'd be to detect.
---
Or just make vault 76 and the flatwoods area pvp free until a certain lvl.
---
Np, may rng smile upon you
---
Cthulu! Come to me, my child!
---
this is a huge nerf to all gun users. how the hell are end game enemies going to be possible when all our weapons feel like smacking a napkin on a scorchbeast face
---
Bullet-sponge enemies is the worst game mechanic ever designed.
---
For real, I would love it so much. But I doing its gonna happen
---
Maybe the caps could scale based on how overencumbered you are. Like if you are 100 lbs over then you have to pay pay 250% more caps.
---
Hey there, I hope every one is well, my worries are, that for those of us that have managed to play the game out properly from the beginning till now (**500+ Hrs Level 183**), that have come to the so-called "**End Game**" and have earned the privileges of such a powerful weapon or weapons are getting duked now, because of a few selfish "Douche Bags" the rest of us are now having to suffer for this so-called balance of game, because they chose to screw others or because it is in high demand? Make the guns for a (Level 100 plus, a signature weapon to a individuals profile, as a reward) I have put up with so much crap from this game, more than any other in my day, and have pitched out close to three hundred dollars in total, to be told the gun, I busted my ass off to get " Assassins  Two shot, shotgun with explosive rounds"  with my perc cards added, after I put in (**250hrs level 122**) of my time to get it in the first place, and now I am getting a gun that is going to be compared to a "**level 50 playe**r" gun that now will only do half the damage it was intended on doing, because it is not fair to other players and because its in high demand now? Not to be rude this is an insult, why don't you start asking players to quit after level 100, because they are too high of a level  to make gameplay fair, or even better ask players to only play the game equally to other players so no one can be a higher level than next player, because it is leading to an unbalanced game? Or why don't we write this goddam game off and start from scratch again, because this is becoming an absolute shit show, to say the least! "**Leave My Guns Alone**", please! I would like to see more balance using karma points, for helping other players, more perk points for higher level players after level 50, more incentives to play the game, Game marshals, too report in-game issues, and to ticket players for abuse, like a 24hr-48hr-life ban. Let worry about the main issues of the game and solving them first before you start attacking players goods and services, that they have slaved to get, or paid for! Let's make FO76 Great again!

Like duper’s and cheaters care what the ToS says. If a terms of service actually meant anything there’d be no cheating right? 
---
Each shot you take reduces your ap, when your ap runs out you die, doesn't make you immortal so much as it lets you take a few extra hits from slow firing weapons
---
I've played since the beta and never had a single bad experience with other players, everyone has been friendly and helpful even in nuke zones. Sorry you had a bad experience, try again on another server and things will likely be different.
---
Far as stability goes, Fissure Prime got nuked 3 times last night on my server and the SBQ fight went fine each time, no disconnects or Queen glitches.  Bugs still exist but it's better than it was at launch.
---
I’ve played almost every FF in the series. I still have a working original NES and SNES with FF 1,2 and 3 (US versions) but yea, the RNG gods in XII were almost non existent 
---
There was an update.
---
Its not being removed. 
---
No... it isn't.  The article was already changed and that part was struck out.
---
Also either way that fact has no bearing on any of the points I just spent my time typing out.
---
Its not about that, weapons are the end game pretty much. I spent 200hrs in game, now my main weapons will be shit. I grinded all that time for nothing. Its fucked up and unfair. The nerf literally changes nothing for greefers because you can still one shot other players. This is affecting PVE people more than anything else.
---
I got the minigun, missile launcher, combat rifle, and Tesla rifle plans
---
I don’t know 🤷🏼‍♂️ 
---
Sorry 🙏
---
You look at any of the posters advertising the armor to start the quest. 
---
Umm...no it is not
---
Not all TSE guns are duped and instigating weapon's are just as exploited if you bothered to do any research.
---
***Death Threats***
---
Just hide all non wanted players except friends. Should add some tension and surprise to meeting someone 
---
This will make anti armor alot more sought after now too
---
I need an explanation on how to start ecological balance when i want.
---
I want the vtu jacket but thay daily never starts,the holotape is never there.
---
Also some say you can get it from any forest event.too confusing.
---
Did you read the plans?
---
&lt;now anything is just compared to a TSE and tossed aside if it isn't even close.
---
u just made me LOL at my cubicle
---
Thus their accounts are being banned. Them not caring is not equal to Bethesda encouraging it in any way.
---
God, I hope this becomes the case.
---
Do the quest the Motherlode to get Combat Rifle plans
---
What’s a 45% reduction to a 375% increase due to having insane strength? Makes no difference. And the damage you output with melee can get so high that even sentinel/assassin won’t save you. A few hits and you’re done. Can’t say the same for TSE
---
Chtulu? that is it?
---
Amazing!  You should do a how to on the walls!
---
Yea its the two shot nerf that bugs me.
---
Or if it’s possible wiping everyone’s inventory and stash
---
only shotguns had this going for them, other tse's require perks to truly shine.
---
Bethesda- hire this guy.
---
Thinking that anyone at BGS spent the time to research connections between power generation in WV and in MA in order to justify re-using FO4 assets in 76 is a far-fetched rationalization that no one would make unless they felt a need to keep thinking the work done on this game wasn't rushed, sloppy, and half-baked.
---
If that's not head-in-the-sand, I don't know what is.
---
And then you'd fast travel to a vendor who still has caps and still be to make a 120-140 profit (assuming 60-80 cost to fast travel) since you can now pick up everything with value and sell it with no inconvenience.  If you did a Whitespring run and picked up everything that'd be a real easy 840-980/day because you could just fast travel to each different vendor. 
---
Forcing players to make choices on what to carry  or forcing them to make the slow walk to a vendor who still has caps helps to keep that in check. 
---
scrap, or keep it unscrapped with hopefulness in ur stash &lt;3
---
the starting vault 76 apartment room has one of the bots on the TV shelf.
---
I based my entire build around not taking damage modifying perks and instead obtaining two shot variants so my endgame damage would be viable. I have one charecter with 6 Two-shot non explosive weapons, my entire build just got completely fucked. I'm honestly infuriated about it
---
Beth sees and listens! Blow this up and maybe they'll hear us.
---
And maybe make travel angent have tiers. Where at lvl 1 you can fast travel up to 50pounds more but add 75% more cap cost. And at lvl 2 it's 100pounds more at 60% caps cost added. And lvl 3 is 180pounds more at 40% caps cost added
---
&gt; guerilla
---
Just so you know, it is considered an automatic rifle so commando are the perks you want for it.
---
Do a passive run it’s time to end the violence that plagues West Virginia 
---
It would be nice if they could reduce high level enemy toughness instead of decreasing damage. It's really not fun to shoot a ghoul 3 times with a sniper rifle then switch to shotgun and shoot them 3 more times, then when the other 3 start pounding on you slowly shoot them 5 times each with the shotgun. 
---
Will do! Thanks for the tip
---
Yea, whatever it takes to make you feel better about it. Thousands of TSE were duped for... what reason? Because they are extremely OP. You say instigating was duped but its not even top 3 mods for melee players soooo, calling you out on that one too.
---
The game resembles a free to play game already . Why ask for a premium when it’s not any different than other online games? 
---
Tommorow 
---
If anyone gets a response from Bethesda please provide that info. 
---
Agreed that would be fun.
---
But about wanted. How do you get wanted on a pvp server? I assumed everything will be free to shoot at without penalty.
---
I agree, not a perfect spreadsheet. I wasn't the one who made it though. It was just shared with me so I shared it with the community
---
Lol. I'd call you a witch. Bahaha
---
Thanks for raising the idea! I see this one all the time so I placed it first in my ideas and feedback letter from the marsupials herd, a pseudo faction I named in a philosophical sense to be inclusive of the type of players I regularly play with and associate with in the podcasting and reddit community.
---
Check out my full post if you like, I'm glad to see this idea still in circulation by the wonderful community.
---
Read on for tangent
---
My ideas in general are meant to be the most obvious indicated improvement and additions available given the current state of everything. Some other ideas are to let containers be carryable and buildable more freely, similar to power armor placing, with a variety of uses/impacts and reasonable limitations so people cannot abuse it or crash servers by spamming, and better container options in CAMPs. I like using the dumpster for my stash but why wouldn't we get an option to have it be an item expiration donation box, where people could freely take but unclaimed items expire after a time (goes with the idea of it being permanent -ish when placed in the world, so other players will encounter the buffer space and I don't have to be logged in for my dumpster to be available to everyone).
---
I'd love to be able to make turrets in the wild, not just by having a CAMP themed for this and spending caps to do so.
---
same lol i keep saying this
---
Shouldn't have to pay caps, atoms, or even a dollar to re-spec. We already payed for the game. 
---
So explosive resistance on players is not marded directly in our stats, so its also just an illusion and there is no such thing. Got it. Totally believe you.
---
Furious as well, as if you can hit your shots, you get +15% per hit, but if you miss or take 5 seconds to put in another shot, it resets. I think it goes to a cap of +100% or +150% as well
---
That just means the people who have their god load outs will just have to re build them and people who don't will be able to freely make god load outs
---
Ordinance express reduces the weight of explosives (including mini nukes/missiles/40mm grenade) 
---
And bear arms reduces the weight of heavy weapons. 
---
No, it's more of disconnects and horrible lag it's the exploiters nothing better to do kinda killed the game for me. I don't even want to play it anymore.
---
I am so glad I looked that up 👍
---
Well, then explain why it does benefit from all 3 shotgunner perks when flechetted :) 
---
bruh and in thew newest version (Zodiac) they were even worse!!! i stopped farming Cerobi Steppe since it would take about 20 hours to farm the rare chests..they were much more generous on PS2
---
Ok bye
---
That shotgun shows almost 500 dmg with 0 perks for it. So that confirms what I was thinking we will still have TSE guns that can 1 and 2 tap mobs if you run perks that support them. People just wont be hitting for 10x the health a mob even has.
---
Datamined Stats? Lol you can see her stats legitimately in game with the right perks dude. Use your own experience and stop using youtubers, TSE trading forums, and how to be 10,000 damage OP guids.
---
Forcing everyone on even terms. 
---
Guess I better start turning in these stacks of technical data I've been hoarding! Thank you!
---
Lol you're just making shit up man.
---
Of course they won't do this. For them, the lack of any meaningful content, the grind is all they have to keep you playing. 
---
I'm like you, had to reallocate 20 points to change build to use TSE. Personally I'm not doing it again. I've got other games I can play. 
---
Explosive resistance on players is from a perk. Once again, look at the datamined SBQ stats and you'll see no 300% explosive resistance. That you pulled directly out of your ear.
---
I have 260 hours in and have grinded and played and have no two shot explosive weapons and only a couple of two shots that I don't use because I have better ones.
---
PvE is fine without these weapons.
---
Not a problem! Just happy to help 😊
---
Destroying bases will still likely do it. Bounty hunting should absolutely be a thing 
---
Wait a month and try again
---
&gt; Stay Away  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Arms in straight in front, frightened face
---
I need this in my life. I'm a stealth sniper and use a hazmat suit in nuke zones. Lost count of how many times I've died because some douche in PA decided to stand beside me and attract all the enemies, especially SBQ.
---
Honestly, you hit the nail on the head with the main reason I wasn't fully into the game when it launched. The whole jumping from holotape to holotape felt more tedious than it was enjoyable. I feel that I'm missing whatever immusion or lore they were trying to go for.  
---
Kinda like:  
---
Holotape - "Go find the location of this person/place"  
---
Me - "Okay... bet that person is dead."  
---
I was never sure if that was ever addressed or tweaked by Bethesda.
---
This. I thought I was the only going crazy. I skipped over the barn plans earlier looking for metal plans, now I got everything BUT barn plans.. rip 
---
Xbox thinks Fallout 76 is a joke right now like most people. They are probably embarrassed having it playable on Xbox. I doubt they will console ban someone for glitching. Hacking or modding is a different story. 
---
Okay but after how many months? In that time the game’s economy has been ruined, god knows how many thousands of illegal cheated weapons have seen different hands. They should be incredibly rare to the point Bethesda didn’t have to nerf them.
---
Perhaps the chicken and the egg situation might be relevant here. Did the game come first or the duper’s?
---
That's what I'm going try to do.
---
Hard reset internet and xbox. Outside of that i know a lot of servers are laggy because of how people are duping. 
---
Maybe make it a quest? Paying is too easy-I get why you want to ( lost track of how many times I've screwed up a good build) Something like finding a functional autodoc. Respec SHOULD be a thing, I totally agree but having to work at it would make players think about their builds a little more.
---
sad times
---
Heck no. It would cause so much lag because people would start being 5000 pounds overweight all the time
---
I think I read that the tommy gun style submachine gun that fires .45 is a rifle, and the 10mm submachine is a pistol. Is that your understanding?
---
The update hasn’t been applied yet...
---
Guess that's why they are fixing it then, case closed.
---
Personally I want to see private dedicated servers where you and a few friends could lease a server. Then you could modify camp limits and persistence to see the map truly grow and evolve with your community.
---
Really had an issue with the 1-shot thing as well. I remember traveling to all the different events that spawned and getting a good amount of XP and they were fun.  
---
Now... not so much. Just kinda going to them for whatever XP I can get while other players do all the work since I can't get a shot in.  
---
Good job
---
Happy to see you are paying your newfound knowledge forward.
---
Xbox? Got a free clean space suit for ya and that tse pipe isn't a bad gun nor will it be after nerf still useable.
---
Yes! I don't understand all of this. You know why I want a TSE? Not for players, just because higher level normal enemies are bullet sponges and I don't want to spend 16 shotgun shells to kill a supermutant. I am level 90 and have never PVP'd, but I've fought lot's of enemies and them shrug off a full magazine is not enjoyable. 
---
Be advised there is HIDDEN RAD RESISTANCE associated with PA and hazmat suits. You can get your base rad resist stat into the 1000's without them, but you'll still take lethal rads in the blast zone. Even the Damaged Hazmat Suit, with a nominal rad resist of 500, offers near complete protection. The rad resist values are a lie and a big FU to non PA builds. This topic appears to have no traction, sadly. 
---
Bethesda didn’t crack down on them the second duping became prevalent. Fuck Bethesda first, fuck duper’s second.
---
And they weigh a pound so stacking a ton of them if you're able to find them would take a while
---
And what do you propose I do with Evan?
---
Thank you for the comment. Glad to hear the entire experience isn't exactly what I have went through so far.
---
It might be a bug not sure. I know it get reduced weight from bear arms and it's under heavy guns with the minigun in the crafting menu so if so you might be able to double dip using the heavy gunner perks with it.  But the best way to check it would be to test it out w/ and w/o against a wall or a tree that you can see the spread
---
Buddy I play with just said he’s at 726hrs so it’s not hat far fetched.
---
Gg math 
---
New stuff new problems 
---
So will change the name to 1.25 shot instead of 2 shot????
---
Really annoying, ive found some really good pipe pistols and bolt ones, but im Revolver specced. Grinds my gears.
---
you can find lever gun plan at grafton station ~900caps, or i can sell you one 2500 caps
---
Nope, still no tweaks, no human nps, no real story. All the patches and updates have pretty much been bug/glitch fixes and server stability fixes. Take that with a grain of salt tho, sometimes they cause more issues than they fix 
---
So the dupers absolutely Had to exploit. They had a choice, they made it, these are the repercussions. Personal responsibility is important. You cant say to someone "you dropped a wallet on the ground because you didn't secure it like you should have, so its your fault I took all the money out" and now that youre being arrested for theft its all Their fault for tempting you.
---
Is that how it works now? I didn't know the numbers
---
Go ahead don’t believe me. Less people using it means less competition for me
---
Here comes the first step of a path that is a total mistake.... taking things out / watering them down instead of making everything cool. It's why my feedback letter is over half composed of "please understand what is special and vital about the game design" in hopes that they can NOT do what historically amounts to flushing fun down the drain while us the players watch fun circling the drain because the game designers can't hear / can't continually understand why people are enjoying the experience. SWG new game experience update. Any part of warcraft after the first 3 ish years. It's really dumb to make fun things in a game and then flush the fun down the drain completely un necessarily. I hope they can hear me and hear us telling them to add to the game, not ruin it with reductions.
---
Do you have the grounded mutation?
---
Not when you keep having to spend caps on taking the workshops again and again
---
There should be a signal beacon of some sort that you craft that will show your shop on the map. Similar to the beacons in FO4 to bring NPCs to join your settlements.
---
I'm all for steps in the right direction. But ending the two shot variant all together seems a little over the top. Maybe make it an extremely rare drop rate even farther. Or how about when you kill 3*legendary creatures I don't just get junk. Or let us build our houses closer instead of me and my team having to be a mile away from each other so we can all spawn our camps. I will say big thanks to besthesda on the glitching. Last night was the first night I've ever played without losing the server 😎
---
I can confirm the same in PS4
---
Agreed. I routinely kill players with bounties but never take their stuff. I had a guy send me messages after and he called me a bunch of names, then I took his stuff! Also he kept coming back for more and I kept killing him it was great
---
TSE damage is hilariously broken. However, some mobs are billet sponges and I agree they should be a little less time consuming to kill.
---
I don;t think that would work. Currently it's already being abused. If you know you're going to enter pvp you can committ a crime for a low bounty, thereby preventing you to lose caps equal to your level when you die. On a pvp server where everyone is already hidden on the map and in pvp mode, everyone would always first thing acquire a bounty. That is if they don;t change the system with regard to caps on these servers.
---
Yes please! If they have +120% to X weapons I might actually carry multiple weapons, mainly ghouls and supermutants. 
---
Yep 
---
Don't use turrets. They don't do anything. All they do is either ignore targets or get immediately one shot by enemies. You're better off saving the budget and defending your base with your bare hands.
---
Yeah, xbox. How much?  And le gun was sold to Wallace for 2 caps. Lol, ugh
---
Any more info?
---
&gt;aus
---
Rather than look at individual elements of FO76 its best to take it for what it is: a heap of shit.
---
A developer who actually *cares* would still make mistakes, perhaps not quite as often, but most importantly, a good developer would have a clue how to talk to the community and make them feel wanted or cared about.
---
This is the first update from Bethesda where I've seen them acknowledge glitches, duping &amp; exploits first hand so its a monumental first step. In reality, they're still nowhere near what the community (even those pro-Bethesda fanboys who excuse everything and downvote anything that runs contrary to Bethesda) really wants and needs.
---
I haven’t played a single player version in quite some time honestly. Once XIV was released I migrated from XI. Small breaks for other stuff here and there but mainly I played XIV until this came out. 
---
Yeah me2, i totally feel you man.
---
And the funny thing is i don't kill mobs so fast anyway,i still need 4-5 shots in head for super mutants for example.
---
The no human NPCs I think are what really gets to me. Can't really "click" with holotapes and robots.
---
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
---
Anything tse is good just upgrafe rifleman cards and demo expert. Im a lvl 77 or so and mine do 2k +
---
Poo shot 
---
I just want my Laser weapons to not be so damn fragile and worth using, currently they break in a few shots and hit like wet noodles.
---
Please buff their damage and fix their durability.
---
Idk if you noticed this, but there is no US government 
---
Nerfing ts feels bad, it's not two shots anymore, I get maybe it's too strong (comments here seem to disagree) it's supposed to be two shots so two bullets, maybe a nerf to weapon accuracy or recoil would be more appropriate given it's two shots coming out. The explosive nerf is completely understandable and I stand by you with that one 100%
---
Pay to win confirmed.
---
Owch yeah man don't do that next time this nerf may only be temporary everything needs balancing and re balancing. And free I don't want it 😆 spread the wealth rather then see someone sell ya there 10000th duped copy.
---
“New Game +” is the system you’re looking for, I think.
---
We don’t live in a perfect world. People do bad stuff because they’re assholes, it was up to BGS to deliver a stable game, or.. at the very very least crack down on the duping as soon as it was revealed. Like the other bloke said, it’s getting fixed now.. well it’s too late. The damage is done.
---
That brings it in-line with the average damage boost of anti-armor and slightly below the damage of enemy-specific weapons (which I think should get a boost to damage, tbh). It makes two-shot good across any situation but not the best for every situation, which is where it sits pre-nerf. 
---
I only keep a few....but can craft any
---
Is it a limited time item? I didn't check when I was logged in.
---
One of every PA in the game for collection
---
And one extra suit that's currently a set of t-51b blackbird for messing around with
---
I'll be on in roughly 30 mins gt is Lanxmixpunk shoot me a msg.
---
Yes!!
---
Since late December to now, I have been griefed around twelve or fourteen ten times by people either destroying my base, Opening trade with me while I run for my life and try to jump over obstacles or killed me with slap damage while trading because I arrived at the trader a few seconds before them 
---
Since everyone else is having a griefing free stellar time, I assume it’s just my luck or the European servers that include many who refuse to speak English 
---
Okay, there needs to be a hotfix right fucking now. On PC quite frequently there's this issue where my game crashes to desktop when trying to respawn and I can't explain the hundreds of pounds of junk I have lost because of this. Still waiting for the day when this game is in a launch-ready state...
---
Definitely agree, just doesn’t feel like fallout only dealing with robots and terminals. There aren’t even any real raider enemies, just their gears. 
---
I have my X-1 as my main piece I use, and my Ultracite in case I ever get mods for it
---
How do I get the lab coat
---
Holy crap it’s so weird. I figured out five taps of fast scroll left will zero it out but it’s a muscle memory I could do without if it’s gonna get fixed. :P
---
I know but I keep seeing posts about how no one will  use the TSE weapons anymore they are going to be junk ect. But they are still going to be good.
---
Is there any evidence that most players have them? I'm level 90 and the best I've found is a two shot(non explosive) combat shotgun. 
---
Instigating will be better on some weapons, now. Furious will have it's place as well! Anti-armor will be better in some cases, worse in others, as the game should be. I think this is a good change that will bring weapon diversity back to the game
---
The trouble with your analogy is that the game not sitting in a temperature controlled environment undisturbed to "mature" and be ready to be drunk. The cork has already been popped.
---
If I remember correctly it's from turning in technical data
---
Lenses/glass probably are clean. 
---
Acquiring mutations via rads is random, however you can buy serums from the enclave or players, and the scorched queen sometimes drops serum plans. As for removing them, it's all random when using radaway or a shower.
---
They are both rifles, is my understanding.
---
Y’all know there’s still duping exploits right? Whatever the meta will be next will be duped
---
I just get authentication errors. I think it’s down for PS4 on the East Coast of USA.
---
I dont think that's the case, it still seems like TSE with 5\* demo expert are going to still do 1-shot damage.  If they made exploding a primary name and not a prefix/minor and not stack with 5\* demo then I could see that as a pretty solid nerf.  
---
When an exploding shotgun can do factors more damage than a mini nuke from a regular fat man, shits broke lol. 
---
Yummmmm supper mutant!
---
&gt;"Well, that release didn't go so well.  Surely there are things that people enjoy about the game?  TSE weapons are the most popular thing we've got going, you say?  Well, we can fix that."
---
We gotta make sure they can hear us telling them what is capturing and enjoyable, the reasons why the game is magical and fresh. It feels impossible to communicate it to them because the variety and intensity of straight negativity, toxic disrespect for what is incredible and classic about the game. I thought about this situation for a long time and created my letter to them with all of the praise I could muster in the front and center, entitled positive feedback.
---
Yea 2 hrs is a bit much. I mean first, how'd she even stay in a lobby that long without getting kicked due to server instability.
---
Invest into Commando and luck perks. Sneak attack criticals are OP with automatic weapons.
---
Uhh.. if you have a source should it be that hard?  I don't even use youtube... take that for what you will
---
I keep 4; X01, T51 Nuka Cola, Ultracite, and Excavator w/shocks
---
Like foggy glasses lenses definitely lower my Per. 
---
&gt; \--"We Failed" 
---
But that sounds tons of fun if you fail the event, and everyone will want to fail then xD
---
It needs to reward people for succeeding instead.
---
For example: Killing the SBQ unlocks other big bosses on the map etc.
---
It could still work with what you say though somehow :p
---
&gt; \--Something related to the Bot Stop events 
---
yeah this kind of event is needed, why we power up those robots if we never see them in action anyway?...
---
&gt; \--Trade parties or something else fun at the Whitespring Resort 
---
We actually need a real trading hub, or other ways for us to buy and sell equipment to other players.
---
Right now TS does more damage than any other ranged legendary prefix except instigating, which is only on the first hit.
---
After the patch it will be on par with furious, anti-armor, troubleshooter, etc. 
---
Right now Explosive is better than any other secondary. After the patch it will be on par with ROF increases, etc. 
---
2, x1 and excavator 
---
Make cheaters and dupers recognizable and let the community hunt them down. Wouldn't mind seeing some kind of exclusive faction quests for dlc. Something special for the responder sna raiders and what not.
---
Why not make it set on character creation
---
From what I've gathered from both market 76 and fo76 bazaar everyone seems to have at least 1 TSE. Enough so that I could make an educated guess that they do. Sorry if I didn't poll everyone to see if they had it to satisfy your scientific journal level of evidence requirement for a fucking video game. Also if you reread you'll notice that most people have at least a two shot not a two shot explosive 
---
This only makes sense. We're supposed to be the best and brightest from vault 76, sent out to rebuild the world. Why are we talking each other? Wouldn't we know each other?
---
Pvp just seems out of place imo.
---
It's not two shot anymore, it's just a 25% damage buff (probably gonna have some kind of name change)
---
they already have a symbol for it in Skyrim and fallout 4 - the assets exist 
---
It’s a small grey eye placed right next to the name of the book or schematics 
---
Reason why they haven’t added it yet?
---
Well only Bethesda knows why 
---
Needing to fight side by side with a bunch of people all using cookie cutter duped and farmed legendary guns isn't fun.
---
Yup. Would balance it out a bit. Dont want to shell out 159 caps if you die? You can go wanted BUT EVERYONE will be able to find you with a big red tarrget on your head. I think that's pretty balanced
---
Damage resistance is flat across the board. Its a simple 300 resist against all damage. I was specifying Explosive because it seemed you were implying that melee somehow has some magic ability to hit more damage than the TSE weapons could. Did you know that other perks have armor penetration? Rifles have cripple 15% chance with lvl 3 Tormentor. You are just making up excuses for your TSE again. Its like you put everything you could have learned about the game and threw it away in trade for TSE. Keep coming with the excuses, Ill keep shooting them down.
---
You can see that I wasn't.  I just saw a bunch of people saying one thing and one person saying another and came to the wrong conclusion.
---
This went away after my base was uprooted on a sever (someone already there)  and I logged into another one
---
I really like having a character. But I for some reason just despised Rose as a character. But I agree that they should add more NPCs
---
Happens to me on PC occasionally. I’ve had to stop playing until a fix is released. 
---
If you stop in the middle of the DMV quest, you have to restart it from the beginning. I literally had this happen yesterday, had to redo all my progress starting at when you speak to the first bot inside the DMV
---
Better yet make them uniquely useful for stealth and other builds by giving them a wider variety of mods. We only want them out of the loot pool because they suck. What if they didn't suck?
---
I didn't cling to it as you can see.  You responded to like 4 of my messages.  Maybe in the wrong order?
---
Thanks for the write up.
---
Mate I'd buy you a beer, cause I couldn't agree more. That would be a PERFECT way to improve the SBQ fight and make it an actual event, as it stands now the end of 76's "story" is literally just hold down the trigger for 5-25minutes (depending on how many high level players show up) and done. Doesn't matter if you die or not, there's no consequence, you just respawn in a couple of seconds in roughly the same place you died. I genuinely don't understand how that was approved when the game was being developed as suitable for a "climatic" ending to the game's main storyline.
---
We actually need a way to rejoin the same server we disconnected.  
---
Also, world events like the nuke zone are very cool because you see the server come together, i get where you are going with it, i hope they consider for future events.
---
it has a 'more hooks' mod iirc, but that's the only one I'm aware of
---
In 4 I got a never ending board. It never needed to be reloaded. Super useful.
---
The buzzing man... it was in the trees! They are in the trees!
---
is it any different graphically?
---
Ok im glad to hear that twoshot explosive weapons are getting a nurf maybe now pvp will be more fair. 
---
But with the damage reduction to explosive weapons what does this mean for Demolition expert and granader??? Will it be +20% with a fully upgraded demolition expert?
---
How will this balance with a fully upgraded fireproof perk if someone is using a twoshot explosive weapon?
---
You are assuming that nerfing explosive legendaries is only about PvP. It's not. It was stupid overpowered. If you didn't expect a nerf, you're a fucking idiot.
---
I just want to be able to walk down a street without hearing the stupid intro to every event I pass. There's one town which can have 3 events at the same time. 
---
Won't happen, I have a +40% Power attack, +30% against Scorched, with full slugger/incision/martial arts... It only puts a chip on the Queen.
---
Unless I happen to be a duper and stacked melee bobbleheads.
---
So yeah, get rid of the bobbleheads please.
---
Slightly off topic; Are holotapes working correctly yet? That was a big reason the story wasn't cutting it for me.
---
She almost NEVER gets kicked off.  I get one every few hours.  She never does.  Not sure why.  PS4.
---
Probably something like Superior or Powerful - ish
---
Yes. Triangular foundations half the size of regular foundations would be great. 
---
Maybe you need to provide the cap.
---
except don't have any cost. Just let a player re distribute the choices.. perhaps let the cost be a waiting period to repeat it. if this is going to exist at all the only cost should be not being able to spam it.
---
I don’t PvP, but I do use them regularly for PvE. Not looking forward to the change. 
---
iirc Space Suit Helmets also don't give a penalty to per, and idk about the enclave one myself
---
I don’t PVP myself but I kinda agree with you there in the caps loss being relative to your level. Everything else is basically capped at 50. The gear...50, the special points...50. Going passed 50 in levels doesn’t really do anything for you other than having a ton of spare perk cards to swap around. 
---
You provide the cap.
---
I have been running a sniper build since BETA (started to improve it now after 50).  
---
Running an anti-armor lever action and a handmade as secondary.  Works better now that I be got my perks lining up.

Nah, I'm just going to care less cause I'm sick of bleeding lead for 100% of the fight while melee are having a tea party in the shed for 50% of the fight waiting for me bring her down. I will just pull out a melee weapon pretend I cant shoot too, let someone else invest a couple hours worth of lead farming into her, loot is the same.
---
Never considered your security point.  Good one.
---
i havent played 14..this is actually my first online game..i love grinding in games so this is perfect for me
---
OP weapons should be nerfed. Sorry, bro. They were ridiculously OP.
---
definitely this was my absolute favorite armor in FNV, before the DLCs came out i walked around everywhere in the regular NCR Ranger armor anyways despite it being mediocre armor at best and having no good offensive stats just because it looks so cool, but then along came this awesome riot gear with +5% crit chance and +10 guns skill, and it was one of the best suits of armor in the game AND looked super cool! best of both worlds
---
Yeah indeed.
---
I would also like a killboard, even out of game, like [https://zkillboard.com/](https://zkillboard.com/)
---
I can currently only brag about reaching the 76 wanted player kills achievement, but if I want to impress girls in the club I need to show more stats.
---
Honestly man I just can't believe "fake news" has spread into the gaming community. 
---
This is total bullshit conspiracy theory talk, but I  honestly wouldn't be surprised if it ever came to light that Rockstar astroturfed and utilized blatant pay for play games "journalism" to disseminate bullshit about fo76 because it threatened their RDR2 launch. 
---
They are both popular narrative driven open world multiplayer games, and fo76 went from announcement to launch in just a few months, which didn't give Rockstar much leeway to move their own launch date.
---
Been saying this since FO3
---
Noice
---
How about a giant cazador?
---
It's all good bro, I'm level 36 and I log out every time a scorch beast spots me and I see guys 5 levels below me running around in the same area. What I don't like is dropping junk when I die because someone could grab it and I'm usually on a screw/amuminum collecting mission and hate loosing it.  I never shoot other players because don't want to loose my caps either.
---
I was thinking about adding that exact thought but I wasn’t sure how to word it. I totally agree
---
there is a mod for pc that add a symbol next to known plans https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/214 
---
if modders could do it Bethesda has no excuse to why they cant add it
---
Just make it caps an ingredient.
---
finally, no mod scrapping, all i've lost is a jetpack and 2 calibrated shocks
---
Bingo we have a winner here folks. 
---
Well, I've been screaming for a TSE nerf... seems they only nerfed the TS and not the E :)
---
idk on that, I know with bird bones it only removes one but yeah
---
i have been unable to trigger the quest again though....
---
I am Groot?
---
The amount of time you have and level 100s is absolutely astonishing to me, I am comin up on estimated 200 hours gameplay and a couple 16-20s, a 25, and my first almost to 50. I'm loving most every minute taking my time with character building and absorbing what the world has to offer discovery and zen-presence wise.
---
I'll try weapon artisan and feathering the trigger for luck of the draw perks. That sounds like it's going to make a world of difference. I don't have a crit build or use VATS.
---

Hello fellow Ark survivor.
---
I have a hold on him
---
You’d love 11 and 14 then 😂. Grind, grind and more grind. 
---
Were you able to obtain the plans for the BoS Combat Armor mod, or were those just individually awarded pieces?
---
Same. If I could disable Rose / her voice, I would. It’s that little girl voice saying profanities routine, like Lena Dunham.
---
If you make a new character, you can just avoid her quest line.
---
All about that KDR bro
---
Stays at 1 with rank 3
---
I had my first ever crash today on PS4. Was defending a workshop and went to loot a corpse then freeze and crash to ps4 menu. 
---
Never had a crash before the update. 
---
Yeah ok, proof though?
---
Caps are a decent way to measure kills actually. 
---
Where do you guys keep it all, in camp box?  
---
**It’s Grafton daaaay**
---
Where did you acquire the medical googles? Ive never even heard of them
---
It's quite a bit larger, overall, than the regular spacesuit helmet.  The visor on the front is also much larger.  I'll post some pics in a min.
---
Yeah I think you shouldn’t drop junk when you die to PvP 
---
Proof of what?
---
I’m tired because I stay up too late playing this game because it’s awesome
---
Second exception: you can relog into same server and get different items each time from grahm and possibly the traveling vendor bot. I did it with grahm, havent had the chance for the vendor bot
---
why would you post that here instead of the official forums? Also, proof, please.
---
I’ve found that name calling and irrational behavior is the best way to get what I want. You got this!
---
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to put in very basic cheat detection. I'm pretty sure IPs and other player info are still completely accessible in the game by anyone- given that their INI files are out in the open and can be edited by anyone.
---
People are just using mule accounts to go into the dev room and move their shit. The accounts get banned but the real people who want these items are still getting them. People are still fully capable of exploits letting them one-shot Scorchbeast.
---
I'm sorry did WoW have this issue? Did any MMO by a Trip A have this kind of issue? Not even most indie co-op games have these issues. My own indie game is built with very little understanding of these mechanics but I have basic cheat protection, no ones IP is exposed, any personal data is handled by a professional third party, and no one can go in and edit files because they're all encrypted.
---
I shouldn't have a more secure game than Bethesda. No one in the indie sphere should.
---
You duped, good riddance.
---
Items are grayed out if you don't meet the level prerequisite. 
---
Dude, it's freaking obvious that it's a heavy gun. And nope, it's not likely to be a bug -- read a description of Flechettes mod, shotgun is mentioned there and it seems that this mod does to this gun something similiar to what explosive affix does to everything -- turns the weapon into a different type WHILE simultaneously keeping its oroginal type. And hence my question. No offense, but I tried to get a little deeper than "harpoon is a heavy gun" with this post.
---
Amen to that!  Also, why do I have to stand up to pick the lock on a DOOR when I don’t to unlock a chest or toolbox on a shelf that is higher then said door’s know?  
---
I have both the standard spacesuit helmet and the Enclave one and they both have the -2 PER penalty.
---
I’ve killed thousands of legendary enemies to get the 3 TSE guns I really wanted, this is probably going to be the last straw for me. 
---
It's not fair of Bethesda to cheaply punish it's own valid players for their own failure to make a game.
---
Another thought would be to have each useless item available at the atom shop for 10-20 points each (shhh I'm trying to appeal to their greed)
---
This would be amazing and truthfully something I never thought off. I hope bethesda sees it and can find a way to work it into the game without possible abuse of it.
---
if its duping that's causing it, then people are likely duping bloodies, anti armor, furious etc.  
---
but it could just as easily also be Bethesda needs to continue to patch and optimize their game...
---
Hope it helps. It helped me a lot learning as I go. 
---
He just started using reddit, no need for the "fuck that guy" comment.
---
All of them.  I never used PA before, except to crush the BoS's dreams, downing the Prydwyn.
---
I'm keeping one full set of each this time.  Yes, even Raider.
---
I haven't earned the Ultracite, yet.  
---
Not sure if sarcastic or not, but they were very clear about microtransactions being cosmetic only. This is a shitty precedent.
---
I got 1-shotted by a player last night with a TSE harpoon gun with 3\* fireproof and dense mod on chest.  
---
So by themselves you can't tank everything, who knows if I had assassins or sentinel assassins 5 pieces, maybe then?  (although I was running around so sentinel would be out the window and he got a pretty sick running lead shot so kudos to that guy). 
---
I know that because -4 strength -75% is 1 but since egghead will result it being less than 1 does it count it or not. Im hoping i dont have to remove it.
---
3:  
---
Excavator for +200 bonus weight (that's the one i use 99% of the time anyway).  
---
X-01 cause its the best PA and coolest (still haven't found that danm jetpack mod though).  
---
Ultracite because it's "rare" and cool and also top tier but i doubt i will ever use it.
---
I've got plenty of quests I haven't done yet and I'm actually working on exploring the map compared to previous titles where I'd do the main story and a bunch of side quests for about 100 or so hours and then stop playing.
---
I love this idea but I’m a big lore nerd and I just feel like this would stick out like a sore thumb
---
I can't comment on face news but i'm not surprised this sort of thing happens.
---
Did you really pay 300 dollars for that gun, or am I not reading this right?
---
Bye mr.angry. no one forced you to play it
---
That would be even better in my opinion. 
---
Except that the whole dev room thing was discovered months and months ago and Bethesda is only doing something about it now. How did they not know??? Why did games media have to figure it out first?
---
Just by the way you’re acting it really makes you come off as a duper thats mad bc they got caught
---
This stood out to me as well, and I believe neither made you stand up in Fallout 4? Not 100% sure.
---
Nope, never been there or had any items from there
---
Maybe, you just really irked me when you said "fuck that guy."
---
I’ve read if you create many of one thing that could cause a ban.  Just dispute it rationally and do this again of that doesn’t work.  This is for the greater good and they will miss sometimes in the process.
---
This is why one of my main feedbacks is to let us make containers and supply drops, so we can give supplies to team mates, do random give away, and generally have item buffer spaces that impact the world and other players. If there were no bugs at all we could be making do with the bags and fixed containers found in the world but I think development attention is warranted in the realm of item exchange for both trade, to make it like fallout 1 bartering, and container usage / possibly even remote supply drop functions through a crafted item or perk ( / item you craft because you have a perk).
---
The game only came out two months ago, didn't it?
---
Did you play only on the first day of beta or something?
---
So it rounds up to 1 even if its says S&gt;1
---
Yeah it's pretty stupid and definitely disincentivizes many from PvPing. If you want to PvP and lose a few times at level 100+ that hurts. Especially when you're outnumbered. Maybe you want to give it a go. Try a few times and see what you can do. You're already at a disadvantage. And then to top it all you're losing all those caps every time. A few losses can wipe you out if you don't hoard caps, which I don't. I generally just like to keep a few for fast travel and buying plans if I see them. I keep bringing up Red Dead Online because it's one of my other recent favorite games, though I haven't played in a month and play FO76 much more, but at least in that you can just PvP and not lose anything. All you can lose is if you hunted something and have it on your horse. Which is like I don't know maybe 10-30 dollars worth of in game currency which is nothing really. And if you don't want that risk you can just fish and the fish go in your pocket with no chance of losing them. This game really makes PvP a bad experience unless you have all the best gear and best build and just kill everyone easily, then it's probably less frustrating if you lose a few times. If you're level 200-300 and lose wow that's gonna hurt.
---
You can put the parts in chassis and it will only weight 10lbs.
---
Not really. Ever hear your teammates cheer from the other side of the map while you're getting kills? While I die a few times and lose some caps, not involved teammates are getting caps without losing any.
---
My question is..how can we provide proof if you cannot log onto the game?  I am actually in the same boat. I have never duped and my account was suspended as well. 
---
Bloodied explosive already beats TSE hands down, with the correct build, it's just TSE is idiot easy point and shoot.
---
As for furious, "maybe", depends on the situation and weapon id think..
---
More profitable places to nuke other than the current two would be nice.
---
Ultimate release.
---
That's... kind of the point, though. The Scorched plague killed or infected everyone in every faction regardless of how they attempted to deal with it with the exception of the Enclave who were doomed by their own robots, and now the last hope for humanity is the newly released Vault 76 dwellers who are left to pick up the pieces and rebuild.
---
Holy crap, I was wondering why I'd only really gotten legendaries from quests.... 
---
Skyrim Unloaded.
---
Shit. Don't tell Todd
---
I kind of wonder if they were planning on having all items placeable but it didn't work out. There are so many things in the game like the bears that look like they were made to be decorations.
---
I've heard that this is caused when you all enter the same area at about the same time. It doesn't happen if, for example, you have someone go in the door, wait for it to fully load, then the next person goes in, waits for it to fully load, etc. It happens if you all go in the door and load around the same time. 
---
It also doesn't happen if you have someone fast travel somewhere, then "follow" their fast travel by fast traveling to the person. 
---
What about some walls that aren't fucking dirty and destroyed. 
---
Its time for:  BLOODLUST or heroism?
---
Probably still reduces 1 STR and 1 END, 3/4=0.75 rounding up to 1.
---
I hate it when a prewar area uses a post war animal mounted on the wall. was it commom for people to have a giant lobster claws before mirelurks existed?
---
Thanks
---
That’s exactly how I feel and I love the RDR2 comparison
---
Even just the little things. Today I noticed an apc that veered off the road and rammed through a wall. The small details of the world are interesting to stumble upon. 
---
in Fo76 it is literally just a beefier stimpak
---
Try putting them in your inventory rather than just in your Stash Box..?
---
I definitely agree, I run a low health bloodied rifle build, do you know that explosive will remain the top tier slot 2 affix though?
---
It's just not two shot anymore, it's 25% flat damage boost. Probably gonna be renamed
---
Man, they screwed those notes up lol. The difference between "rebalancing" and "removing from game" is, uh, kinda big.
---
I know, im just super angry. I did dispute it very rationally, unlike I did here. This was more of a steam release.
---
I put a lot of time in the game and just wanted to rant.
---
Im also angry because Ive had many issues with the game and support never helped even once...So I dont believe my dispute will be taken into account at all.
---
Build is based around crafting and luck. Perks are about reducing carry weight mostly. Nothing to increase damage or to really help in a fight. Armour all has something it reduces the weight for too. Except the Charmeleon Chest. She also has pastor vest and a fisherman's hat on but that's just a cosmetic choice.
---
Weapons I alternate between whatever I've accumulated ammo for. Right now I am carrying a Vampire's Power Fist (for melee), level 10 Two-shot Single Action (I'm level 150 but it's a fun gun to use), Two-shot 10mm Machine Gun, Explosive Shotgun (single shot). When they run out of ammo I'll swap in my Vampire's Minigun, Two-shot 50 Cal / .308, Two-shot Explosive Handmade. When they run out I swap around again and again.
---
After this balance I will probably be having to change most of my weapon setup, as you can see I have quite a few effected guns. I'll see whether my weapons are still relevant and slowly swap them out for whatever is now best for me. We're 2 months into this game being out. Changes will be made all the way along. I'll look at the changes and do my best to adapt.
---
What character are you running?
---
Thanks, pretty lame some have 20 or more mods and some have one. 
---
True but when its 1v1 it's pretty clear whether you came out ahead or lost more than you gain. I'm sure they'll add something. I'm just going to be happy to finally be able to do hunter hunted
---
I was gonna keep one of each but didnt have the room for that many frames
---
Thanks! 
---
yup by 75%
---
Aight man, hopefully 2nd time around its better
---
Yeah same with the "provide evidence!"  and the "just go to youtube!"
---
The m79 also benefited from shotgun perks but was deemed a bug so there's that.  Like I said if you have the gun and the mod go test it
---
2 months and 26 days ago was the first beta date
---
Likely, what can beat it besides faster fire rate for slower weapons maybe?
---
Won't know for sure until we see the changes, but at 25% effective it's still likely to beat out the +10% DMG from aiming 
---
How does that make sense?
---
How would you act if they would ban you today and you try to log in?
---
Do you think youll be all happy with a smile?
---
Lvl 25/PC. Last week I found mine at the Power Plant north of Nuka Cola Plant. Don’t remember if the plan was on the ground, on table or in a box. What I do remember is that it was on the SW side of the plant across from the train stop. In a loading/maintenance area. If that make sense. 
---
there is an enclave spacesuit? can you show its pic too?
---
No as a member of the universe I say fuck that guy
---
Quit running into bushes, fool!!
---
Thanks for you support, youre a great help.
---
Wow dude you like to stalk people and go through so many threads... i like respond to one thing and there's another one talking about the same thing
---
Did it really? 
---
Lots of bugs have been fix. What were annoyed by specifically? Maybe I can answer if those issues have been fixed or changed?
---
Idk its just really funny that you’re acting like you’re 5
---
On my dispute to Bethesda, I asked them to provide proof that I duped. They havent replied yet.
---
mannequins existed in skyrim before dlc you could purchase them for your house in solitude but they would but and walk around like normal npc 
---
I would assume it would just say strength -1 but it interestingly says S&gt;1. Guess well have to experiment to find out. But yea I would assume it still goes to -1 Strength. 
---
Cmon, that's only, like, 12 hours a day, every day... totally reasonable O.o
---
Youre not helping man
---
lolno. Explosive shotguns were ridiculously OP.
---
I'm throwing atoms at the screen but nothing's happening... 
---
considering how heavily you've been trading in the fallout 76 market reddit. 
---
You've either purchased one of those items: 
---
* unobtainable carnival masks (Owl Mask,death mask)
---
* The Assault marine armor helmet
---
* Paintjob plans (Atom Cats, BOS Elder, Sentinel, Knight ...)
---
* Hunters hood
---
and since its items from the dev room, that's what triggers the ban. 
---
Or someone just caught you duping .
---
I have him held at gunpoint.
---
Wishing you luck man.
---
YES! FUCKING NERF EVERYTHING! 
---
THAT IS THE END GAME!!! 
---
Afaik for whatever reason the consoles struggle more then PC. Anecdotal going from the posts here though.
---
I find in laggy servers it happens more often.
---
Under UI cards that have been upgraded should stlll be usable at a lower level.
---
This doesn't affect final gameplay, just the usage of the UI for the abilities that are already in the game.
---
It's part of my feedback letter responding to their call on inside the vault.
---
Most likely a bug, they forgot to add the negative to it.
---
Awesome that this was updated by BGS and I appreciate everyone who was vocal about this.
---
In all honestly adding explosive to a weapon is not helping, it further requires attention from them regarding balance (stacking perks/bobbleheads/magazines etc) when they should focus on content and bug fixes already no need to further add in multiple affected perks/buff and balance issues on themselves.
---
sorry I just dont agree with you. I use my two shots constantly for pve, especially my shotgun. I like the stuff I have and I feel like im paying the price for something I had nothing to do with. 
---
I'm just passionate about refuting false information.
---
TSE were OP.
---
Fuckin' deal with it.
---
Nothing special going on here, just keeping up to date with all the new items and sales. Sorry for the caps guys.
---
Well, it just let me build one piece of armor. Some of the junk was in my stash and some in the inventory. And the crafting menu says I have everything to build it. But when I try, it says I lack the materials. I’ll try though. 
---
Did you have lots of tse weapons?
---
Who the hell is designing these shop items, Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond?
---
have you tried armor piercing mods and/or legendary effects?
---
Meanwhile I have a 3, a 2 (from an accidental click and overclick of the accident because reasons), and severals 1s of concentrated fire including the "Rare animated" version that come out of perk pack. A card I would never really willingly use below 3/3, and the usage of it is for only specific combat situations.

How you balance a game without actually playing it
---
Really? Did you take a poll? 
---
Nerfing big, fun explosive weapons? BORRRRRRING.
---
Is nerfing the end game? 
---
Then don’t use them, it is a personal choice!
---
WoW has exploits today with entire markets dedicated to them, if it was so easy, wouldn't they have it down to a science and never have any anymore.
---
Your game is simple and small scale compared to Fallout 76 and also has a smaller userbase so is a smaller target. 
---
For the dev room, they aren't done yet. First they took care of the people who accessed it, and they blocked access, wait and see what happens next.
---
All those stories of exposed IPs were false.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9up1g6/fallout_76_uses_tls_to_encrypt_data/
---
Since you are running with imaginary issues, this conversation is done.
---
So not claiming you duped, just pointing out why others may find your claims suspect at best in case you wanted to clarify a few things. First of all you seemed to go to great lengths getting that assassin sentinel set only to suddenly start trying to trade it back off for other items. Your stock only has ever gone up and rarely down. You periodically make the same posts with the same items despite countless people offering frankly over the top offers for some of your items. You exclusively trade in PMs and never publically accept a trade where it can be read what you agreed or disagreed to. So to summarize we have a constant trader who apparently never accepts any offers since his stock never decreases yet somehow either gets gifted free stuff or is just hella good at farming legendaries.
---
Yeh i get it too. 
---
Which is why to avoid frustration I only so it for the xp/plans when it comes to workshops.
---
If creating a high rate of items is an offense that can get people banned them I’m screwed. I’m sitting on over 17k rds of ultracite .50 ammo lol. The only reason I have that many is because it’s less weight than having all that flux, fluids, masses, gunpowder, lead and steel just sitting around. 
---
Funny because I saw melee getting like 6-10k damage. Guess he's not as smart as he or you think.
---
Eh, it's like 50% less buggy. Balance is the same. It is more grindy than it was before.
---
I tried to give someones junk back to them and it was like yakkity sax was playing in the background. Someone else ended up picking up the junk and gave me the heart emote.
---
I did to medium. Not Much better. 
---
It works for the bot too, it works for every vendor
---
Good thing I'm moving away from explosive weapons except my sniper weapon.  I find that my automatic weapons kill most thinks extreamly fast anyways.  Seen a guy kill a scorchbeast with a normal automatic weapon (non explosive) faster than my explosive two shot lever.
---
Don’t mobs level adjust to reflect your own?. I know areas I visited at lower levels, when I return are still lower level. But every new place I visit at my higher level has appropriate mobs. 
---
No, you're missing what he is saying. Luck doesnt increase the odds of a legendary dropping, only the condition it drops in.
---
Ikr? Fml I need to catchup on sleep due to this game haha.
---
Thanks I'll have to check it out appreciate the info!
---
I've been trying so hard to get the T- plans. Distant thunder, big events. Watoga and Phoenix checks. Sigh. Am jealous
---
I would at least like to know how the Soda bar gets restocked in the whitespring.
---
There has got to be more ways to acquire than just letting that robot have nuka caps.
---
Unfortunately you are a bit of an innocent victim here, but it is for the greater good of the game so hopefully you adapt.
---
Look in the bright side, you got to use those weapons and enjoy them as-is un-nerfed. I never will.
---
Melee weapons can do 5k+ on a basic build. How good is your shotgun compared to that?
---
I have my T-60 set, which I always use, and my Ultracite set in my STASH. I don’t really bother with anything else, and don’t even use the Ultracite set.
---
I did hunter/hunted once and it was the best experience I had in this game next to a 30 minute 3 vs 3 fight all over Watoga. 
---
Not for long though.
---
 I don't have a PA. I may get one, I dunno. I have an X0-1 on my higher level char and she just crushes em'.
---
 The gun is OP!
---
I can never get lobbies. How does it work?
---
Problem is players need more damage mitigation versus other players. Quick 1 PvP isn't fun, one sided PvP isn't fun either.
---
This is what I’m thinking.  Now it will just take a few extra shots.  Damage will still be insane.   
---
I never had any of those items, and there is not a way for someone to catch me duping, because I never have.
---
Thanks, i will still not buy them though xD
---
A copypasta of the same generic email that other people supposedly received is far from "proof."
---
All I know is that some douche was plugging away at me at level 4, I was losing hp, and I couldn't do anything to stop it. I finally turned off pacifist mode and killed him. Then I figured some level 200+ was gonna gank me, so I jumped servers. I never accept random trade or friend requests so no biggie. 
---
Also tone down how often Junkie weapons pop. I swear 2 out of t weapons that drop for me are Junkie.
---
People spend $5 on this?
---
Just dont use missile turrets and we're cool.
---
There's no Enclave space suit, as far as I know.  There's a Scout Armor Mask you can purchase once you've unlocked the the Production Wing kiosk (also purchasable at the Military Wing kiosk).

It's from people flushing all the toilets repeatedly.

I want to downvote you for even thinking this. Now i need an explosives build just in case. FUCK!

Yea maybe ill play again but as for now im moving on until im not mad anymore. I still blame bethesda more than the dupers. They dont need to do this with the two shot, its pointless. Its not stopping the dupe exploit its not stopping people from getting one shotted. The only thing its doing is hurting people that play pve. 
---
Karma would be a lot better than the bounty one off where there is no underlying level persisting. Since it has always thematically been present I like the potential of this idea, if there is a way it can be done very very well in the current game systems.
---
What system are you running on? 
---
Ah okay. Probably explains why I have no more budget, I'm only a level 70. Thanks! 
---
I think this is the key, they have to have something they can point to and say "This is what we saw in your account that warranted a ban".  Would be extremely interested to see if you do get a response.  
---
This is PvP. There will hopefully be no unfair advantages like that. That's what regular servers are for. The softies.
---
They should get rid of that shit and make it work like hacking and lock picking
---
You have to remember that the perks for explosives damage are much higher than that of weapon specific perks, plus most npcs don't have an explosive resistance. If they just removed the explosive trait from weapons and made it a separate perk with separate applications they could increase both build diversity and improve balance. 2Shot could be incentive for mid-high level players to work towards to strengthen their builds who don't use sneak attack or melee ignoring affects. 
---
Don't forget most multiplayer pvp enabled games reduce or mitigate base damage on weapon effects and skills because most npcs in game have higher health/damage reduction than players. My opinion is explosive damage should just be completely separated from weapons so it's a separate alternative build, we need more build diversity.
---
Oh, since it was called out separately from the point about high condition items, it read like the legendary frequency was higher too.
---
Bah. 
---
Nobody is going to be wanted ever hopefully on these PvP servers
---
The same reason a new virus can infect a computer even if it has an updated antivirus. Heuristics only go so far.
---
The holidays probably Ly played a part in the delayed response too, probably not the best launch date for a company trying a new MMO.
---
I've got no vendetta against you.
---
u/deadpelicanguy on the other hand...
---
What is exploiting the system?! Flying around because bird bones and marsupial are broken? Every person in the game somehow exploited the system, you cant play the game without "exploiting the system"
---
If you try to collect dirty water a few times, thats exploiting the system.
---
Atom? While you might be okay with this we were confidently told Atom would only be used for cosmetic items.
---
If they were to add a re-spec option for Atom then they would be backing out of that fact and completely opening the Atom Store for other none cosmetic items. I don't think anyone (or at least the vast majority of people) want this.
---
I completely agree there needs to be an easier way to completely re-spec your character but we shouldn't be advocating for them to rework the fundamental concept of the Atom Store.
---
It says right there that if you have been flagged in error you will be unbanned, it will take some time.  
---
There's 2 cases for now:
---
1. You were a duper and they flagged your account and now you are banned.
---
2. You were banned by mistake and a dev will get to your account and check for himself if you didn't cheat and they will unban you.
---
They should make all perk cards work like hacking/ lock picking
---
It's not a personal choice when someone stacks 300 bobbleheads and kills players at will because they do so much damage that the slap damage is enough to kill a player. Hows that for fun? Personal choice or not, it ruins the game experience. If you wanna be a god then go play FO4 where you can do as you please. There is no excuse for how over powered these weapons are and why they should stay that way
---
We need more raider/wastelander/survivor type shop items, all this money I'm not spending in this game is making me buy more alcohol .. give me a reason to throw money at you BGS!!
---
I know right?
---
I have never created bullets actually, which makes it more suspicious on their part. They have yet to provide proof to me on why I was banned.
---
I agree. I've said pretty much the same many times myself. 
---
What do you suppose I do? Why would I even make this up? Are you mad?
---
I had to stop playing. Been having constant blue screens on ps4. No matter where I am or what I do. I can play for a few minutes and get blue screen. No point playing it anymore. 
---
4 all level 50
---

---
Play for yourself and see, you already bought the game.  At this point i got everything but rare outfits, so all i do is trade, buy and sell items. 
---
Ugh! I'm at work for 3 more hours. I even tried like 5 times before i left for work...
---
PS4 and have the same problem. Very annoying. We have a work around though (night not work on PC idk) Sending a team invite to your friend in the main menu should work. That lets them join the team and the team leader can search for a game with the team. They should stop adding micro transactions for a small while and fix a core element of the game. 
---
You make some valid points, I like your thinking. The explosive mod would be pretty interesting if it was something we had to find ourselves as opposed to already being part of the weapon. Also, I hope they fix the PVP system at some point. Its awfully buggy and broken right now, from my experience. I feel dirty one tapping people
---
Yesssssss exactly
---
10-20 shots is the problem. Unlike you, that is not fun for me. We both should be able to play the way we want to play. We both paid for the game. It is completely ok with me that you like to spend 30 minutes killing something. It should be ok that i do not.Why would you be happy or even care about the nerf if it does not affect you? That is crazy thinking.
---
I can't stand the rolled up legs on most of the jeans, ruins so man good outfits.

Have an X-01 as my main ant a T51 Nuka. Im sorta working on assembling a T45 for the hell of it.

I always play in pacifist and have been killed on several occasion by one-shot lost caps and all my junk I was going to store.  IMHO pacifist Mode is junk
---
"Dear Bethesda.
---
I believe my account was flagged in error for item duplication. I did not create a large amount of items and I am uncertain as to why I have banned. Could you please re-evaluate my account and inform me on the results? 
---
Thank you for your time, JosesMesus."
---
Feel free to copy/paste that.
---
Thanks, that looks useful.
---
I love you
---
Thanks man. Changing servers worked. 
---
It took me a while to figure out but I had to log out of the launcher and log back in before the showed up for me to download. Took a while to figure out since I never turn off my computer or log out of the launcher 
---
Ikr? Something fishy going on here.
---
The f\*kc is going on? I can't get on any servers tonight. Servers aren't responding.
---
nah. I got super overleveled in a nuke zone because bloated glowing ones kept spawning and I could farm them, so I made a new account, but stopped playing. Both accounts had shite on them,
---
This. Melee is overpowered far more than TSE guns ever were, hell bloodied is leagues better than TSE now anyway. It was just an easy target for the ignorant complainers.
---
No worries, glad it worked 😊
---
This guy doesn't understand game balance. If you make one weapon 5x better than any other weapon type then everyone has to use that one weapon type instead of the weapon type they enjoy. All these other issues are unrelated to one weapon type being too powerful compared to others. You fix things individually not as a whole.
---
Sell it make food or just destroy them slowly
---
I found the plans for the BoS Combat Armor Arms at Grafton Station, recently, though they seem to be quite rare. I don't have the legs/torso yet, level 111.
---
Okay I guess that's correct. But what I really meant is that a properly working perk system can already be found in Fallout 4. All the devs have to do is emulate that system.
---
You could have told me that was already in the game and I would have responded with a "meh, whatever i guess." I literally wouldn't buy it if it was free!
---
Prettu sure theres one in the artisans store...
---
This has happened to me quite a few times. Very frustrating. In fact, it just happened to me. I happened to pick up a level 40 assault rifle. I had no use for it or that type of ammo, so I thought, “why don’t I mod it so it is maxed out, find a level 40 player, and give it to him/her and the 2k rounds for it?” So I maxed it out at the weapons bench. I then fast travelled to about 4 level 40 players and dropped it in front of them to no avail (no mic). I finally find someone who is friendly and stationary, so I drop it and all my ammo. And then I flash my light because it is dark. But what do I see? Nothing. No bag. And the person just as the “???” animation. I decide it’s time to call it a night, so I get a safe distance away and shoot my explosive ammo at my feet, die, and turn off my console. The end. 
---
Well that's like three months, so maybe they only played the first day of beta after all
---
You can have a PC Preston Garvey, but he might fight back

Right? Now what guns are even worthwhile?
---
Netflix and chill?
---
I hope you have strong finners .. if not you will.
---
Sure, I largely have the same attitude, but....for example, I can camp the entrance of Vault 76 all day and kill any new player coming out of there, assuming we're starting new characters like OP suggests. The newlings have no weapons, no gear and no other locations than the vault discovered to respawn. On the current servers they solved that by preventing pvp below lvl 5. Maybe on a pvp server you should be safe until lvl 3?
---
I’m 37
---
I think the days of rational thinking from Bethesda are far behind us. Ill be lucky to get any reply...
---
100 hours and the list of items youve had according to your post history is absurd. Ive put in 500 hours, with lots of grinding nuke zones and SBQ, and I'd be ecstatic with 1/10 what youve had. Also "H: Whatever you want" is about as suspicious as it gets.
---
PC
---
Thank you! This Will help me alot :)
---
That would depend on the plastic used. Different plastics are soluble in different compounds. Try to put gasoline/petrol in a plastic cup (Solo cup, if you have those there) and within seconds you're left with a nasty mess, yet you can safely store the same petrol in a plastic container designed for that purpose. It's like how ethanol will degrade fuel lines in cars, unless they're designed for ethanol.
---
Thems duper words.
---
Yeah, some of my fave weapons have one.  Mr. handy buzz saw, for example.
---
I had 1,400 corn. If you're on PC, set up a macro. If you're on console like me, make a pot of coffee, warm up your fingers, and get to work on pressing two buttons in rapid succession.  
---
Then do it again when this happens a second time, because it still isn't entirely fixed.
---
I play solo because none of my friends play it.
---
If you have a single one of those at level 3, it is weaker than if you were to use all 3 cards at level 1 for the same amount of points (30% vs 20%). This only matters if you aren't going to spec fully into damage though.
---
Thanks man, but I already sent them a well written long response to their email. Still nothing
---
You are so full of shiattte
---
Dump it all in a bag
---
I only use my TSE shotgun in PVP on someone who is griefing another player, especially if it's a low level. Other than that, I use my grognak axe. I dont like watching people being picked on (so long as they didnt provoke anything)
---
Give an active effect boost for every team member you have. That way people will be encouraged to find a team mate even if they are random. This will make the game.more enjoyable
---
#nailedit
---
Not playing right now but it is this [https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Flight\_helmet\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Flight_helmet_(Fallout_76))
---
I just dont see how nerfing two shot is necessary. Explosive maybe. So many other things they could have done. Its all good tho ill play again eventually but for now im done. I cant go in this weekend knowing next time I play all my stuff will be pretty much worthless. I need time to heal lol. 
---
Cool, it would be a baseline acceptable mechanic without bugs but lots of development attention is warranted on the realm of bartering, item containers, and supply dropping as a system of impacting the world and players either randomly or intentfully. this is a main component of my feedback letter responding to their call on inside the vault.
---
Great they're getting nerfed before i ever get one... 
---
But it is needed, 2SE makes all PVP a 1 shot kill - may as well be playing red dead online
---
Yup...regularly, the Queen I can normally loot though she must get loading priority
---
Somebody send in a bug report, I'm too lazy :p
---
Am I the only one left more confused by this thread than what they wrote in the blog?
---
I had that random error, just reloaded game and seems ok now.
---
I do a sell run every night. I'm in the same boat looking for people to play with since I always find myself playing solo. Add me GT Sidedaddybear 
---
Or fix the Bobblehead cheat and the Shotgun triggering the explosive effect 20 times/shot bug. This would settle things down more that a nerf. 
---
All you did was make dupers have to consume a few more bobbleheads from their stash of 500,000 to make up for the lost damage.
---
Lord fix what broken stuff before you nerf stuff.
---
What if your antivax
---
Shrouded Wood is where it's at for those if us who love to sneak. I want some 3* Wood armor. You can sneak at full run speed and with full sneak and evade perks you basically invisible. I'd love them to drop more wood mods.
---
Yeah I’d get some of that stuff too but always at least 1-2 plans. Sometimes duplicates though. Pretty sure I got the metal building plans that way too. I didn’t start doing any of them until level 60+ so maybe that means something?  No idea.
---
Check the OPs username and the top comment on this thread.
---
It's not like I'm scanning the dark web trying to dox people. It's literally as simple as "view profile."
---
I've invited many people to review my post history, especially when they make accusations against me.
---
its the same game, so far there arent any bugs i have heard of anywhere in anyones post that are just one platform. the only exception being push to talk.
---
So much love for more placeable CAMP objects as rewards for events and achievements. I need one of those little house teapots on my table. 
---
It still isn't right for them to punish innocent people who obtained these weapons legitimately through reward or spent thousands of caps on an (admittedly most likely duped one) just because exploiters ruined it. The weapons would have been way way way more rare and there wouldn't have been anywhere near the level of complaining about people using them.
---
There are alot worse things that need nerfing, especially before these PvP servers come out. Two shot explosive weapons are not your greatest worry.
---
&gt;to 
---
Thats a great theory haha, but to be frank with you, I never traded for those items. I got offers for stuff I dont need, hence making the posts again on a later date. I was looking to complete sets or get better items. I had no interest in trading with most of the people who offered me, so I ignored them.
---
Everything can look suspicious if you point a finger to it.
---
you can use the veil of mysteries for the exact same effect
---
Ha I feel your pain. I'm in my late 30's.

4. Decontamination Shower will not place on floors inside the C.A.M.P / base (w/ and w/o roof overhead). I receive the message "Cannot place item: selected item is floating." It will only place on the ground and foundation floors (tested both) - side note it will actually place on stairs railing but I believe that is not what was intend/ separate bug

To which deity did you sell your soul to obtain all of these

Especially the traveling leather coat has been a seemingly hopeless search for me (I know you can get it from mire events)

I killed a 3 star but didnt get any loot :( 
---
I don't die, but I still cripple limbs.
---
Damn, well next time. Got lucky though got the decam arch plan from the event so not a total loss
---
Ya, CS just sent me a canned statement and a walkthrough. No immediate fix, I guess - unless you get a more attentive CS rep who is willing (or able to) to reset the quest or re-checkpoint you at an earlier point. Kinda blows.
---
&gt; stuff that drops at 90 to something over 100% condition?
---
Can you explain this a bit more?
---
Plant it.
---
Every. Freaking. Piece.
---
The guy might have hoped out of the map and skadoodled his way in
---
Because they want us all to be Grognak the Barbarian.
---
Does it go that high? I have a few furious weapons, maybe thebeffect shows in the pip boy and I can test. 
---
One of those furious guns is a plasma thrower. Muahaha. If they ever fix energy guns, it’ll be a monster.
---
Stay far away.
---
I said this a month ago and said they should (and can very easily through the esm) swap explosive with a tier 1 effect that doesn't add excessive damage 
---
Happens in most games with anti cheat, they have to tweak the heuristics, so to begin with there will be a number of false flags, as time goes on and people report that they were falsely flagged, the system will have more information to work with and less false bans will occur.
---
Well enjoy your extra diseases then
---
*over 100 hours. Not sure how many ive played, but pretty much many hours a day since Beta.
---
I like trading, its what I do. I want the best items so i get them. You think you need to be a duper to have the best items in the game? Everything costs like 2-5k caps. Are you kidding me
---
I know there's reports of them banning people using pc addons for 76 pretty hard
---
See this is what im saying, so many options but they choose the one that affects people who have nothing to do with duping or even PVP. This affects PVE more than anything. A dude on reddit can come up with better ideas than the whole dev team over at Bethesda lol. 
---
&gt; Which events do you feel are most rewarding to you? Which events do you not care about doing or dislike? Why?
---
Daily events are for limited games without deep worlds to explore. FO78 has a deep immersive world. It doesn't need gimmicky, kitschy, meaningless events. If you must create events, make them fit the world, not be a bunch of cookie-cutter nonsense missions copied from other games.
---
&gt; Which events do you prefer to play in a team vs. solo? Why?
---
I'm usually the lowest level person on the map because I can only play a few  times a week. Yesterday I saw a level 280+. it's sort of impossible to make teams with such absurd gaps. What are you doing to address the abundance of high-level characters with nothing to do but squat in a crater and smash the SBQ with a sledgehammer?
---
&gt; What ~~types of events~~ would you like to see in the game?
---
Fewer events, less garbage Fortnite style costumes, less dupers with TSE, and fewer ridiculously high-level characters. It's also worrying I never see low-levels anymore. What are you doing to address the perception the game is a broken cheater's paradise lagfest among journos, gamers, and youtubers? What are you doing to bring in new  players, to give players tools and reasons to even team or do anything together?
---
&gt; How do you join events? Do you fast travel? Do you go to a location expecting to start an event?
---
I join events by being forced into them because I accidentally walked past one while exploring the world. Then I have to stop and turn it off in the quest menu because having one third of the screen devoted to useless static text is a huge liability in combat. Surely you have stats on this? Surely you are tracking what percentage of players actually do these events and what percentage are all clustered down in the cranberries, waiting for nukes?
---
&gt; How would you feel about bonuses for completing a daily or weekly event?
---
If you want to retain players long-term, make factions, guilds, new storylines, invasions, improve and expand the end-game. More bothersome events won't do it.
---
13 hours of Netflix a day is not healthy either. 
---
Demolition expert? 
---
I barely remember this but I seem to remember bits and pieces 
---
ha, was wrong :D
---
#FakeNews. sounds like you never even played the game, get out of this feed and spread your bs somewhere else
---
As others mentioned it’s much much weaker, though youbare right that using all perks is highly recommended and will give you much more damage.
---
Thing is, it will become necessary to aim. These guns, right now, can kill a lot by just carpet bombing the areas around your target. It’ll still allow some slop, but nothing like before.
---
I am using mods like perk loader and a better looking map, but they didnt say anything in the email :(
---
Recently put out my review/reflection on the game (via the Anchor platform) and why it feels fresh and also honoring of all the traditions I come from in role playing, character building, adventure exploration gaming. The fact that it is really enjoyable feels like a secret that gamers will gradually learn and I understood it almost right away (was surprised, never saw it coming)
---
The BOS symbol is the only difference 
---
Maybe someone picked the wrong dropdown when banning you for another reason. Tha happens sometimes.
---
I always figured It was my character stubbing their toe.
---
“Extra Hook” and it often appears at the Flatwoods vendor.
---
Good job guys, i have played every game in the series so far and i love the latest edition, i don't understand the hate and negativity in the media and on forums. Your clearly responding to user feedback and the game is excellent and truly revolutionary Imo.
---
well then it sounds like you guys should be busy on the offical forums instead of trying to farm karma on here huh.
---
Its ugly as hell
---
Thanks, I know that, I just want to be angry and see if other people got the same treatment..It just sucks because I love this game and I wish they wouldnt fuck things up.
---
Ive been doing increases at 5 level increments. Allows me to do noticable changes at a single interval. Maybe move two SPECIAL points and grab up three perk cards after the card pack opens up. 
---
Respec would be great but this method allows for more measured upgrading. 
---
I don't need to add a story here about a lvl 300 and his two much lower lvl friends who decided to follow our team around a Whitesprings nuke zone only to one shot all 4 of us so they could take all the hardened mass that we had collected. I have but I don't need to. It has become the nature of the game. 
---
The fact that reporting this behavior is usually met with blanket suggestions to block the player or ignore them. Essentially saying "players will be players" along the lines of boys will be boys. 
---
Without addressing this problem, Bethesda would be rewarding &amp; encouraging bullying behavior. 
---
You're going to have to spell it out because I still have no idea what you're talking about
---
lv 50 furious, 3 star, 25% att spd, 90% reduced weight
---
I guess the main thing I would like to see is events that we can trigger ourselves. Also make some events harder that require teamwork to complete. Just like SBQ. That’s the only time you need to have people come together to complete a event. 
---
there's a post on the market reddit that explains a reason you could get banned, it's if you're in possession of one of those items :
---
it's items that came from the dev room, so if you unintentionally purchased them from a player, it triggers a ban.
---
Fireproof reduces explosive dmg by 45%, how much does dense mod reduces?
---
Whats a dropdown?
---
 you too can have a  symbol on your chest by turning in 1000 tech data
---
Yes, I'm using an explosive double barrel 646dmg before all other effects
---
Killed a mirelurk queen and got a legendary wooden armor piece and a plan for an ivory revolver. 😏
---
Same in 4. Same with terminal hacking in both games. 
---
DEAD....
---
Months away if at all.
---
I do as well.
---
Most people don't know how to play. You wouldn't beat people that knew how to play properly even if they used a shitty pistol.
---
Kiting has been a thing in games for a very long time. 
---
This man gets it
---
My launcher hasn't shown down at all....
---
I feel like I don't fully understand explosive legendaries. If 20 percent bonus damage in an area is the new, nerfed normal, what were they doing before? And what is the 20 percent based on? Base damage? Modded damage?  
---
I have to imagine demolition expert will continue to boost the damage unless they say otherwise, which means they are still going to be formidable guns.
---
Double tap.  
---
Because it does affect me when some gu toy clear an entire room in one shot with a TSE double barrel. And 10-20 shot should not be a problem when you are literally trying to tackle giant atomic monsters or military grade robots I'm talking bosses here not just normal mobs. 
---
Maybe they will release a sandbox mode for you guys where you can play fallout building simulator without mobs XD [/s]
---
But I hope they do find some middle ground to make us both happy. Maybe making the enemies more interesting and making fight more tactical
---
Ok well in a nutshell, they've fixed a bunch of bugs. There isn't any new content yet, but they announced some upcoming things that sound nice (player vendors, PvP mode).  They're also going to nerf the shit out off tse weapons next update.  I don't know you well enough to say if you'll be disappointed or not, but those are the highlights.  
---
Thanks for your help. Your team is great.
---
Cool, I'm fine with losing some power, but I still have to be efficient as possible. 
---
PVE servers and PVP servers need to be seperate....I can 1shot just as easily with my instigating 2hander in PVP plenty of snipers can one shot with plenty other weapons , your just doing this to ruin the value for the @#$@#%dupers ...which you should just be wiping the people that have hundreds of thousands of pounds of shit on mule accounts... and fix bobblehead stacking if you want to fix the damage problems ...TSE weapons were fine as end game weapons... couple people wine about it in PVP situations now its ruined as a PVE weapon... again separate servers for PVP and PVE and stop nerfing the fun on the PVE side ....explosive 2 shots are legacy to be OP its been that way since fo4 ... and it should remain that way ....if you want to curve PVP damage of explosives use the firefighter perk card....and bethesda should buff  the firefighter perk at max rank to be 80% explosive defense , then TSE weapons in a PVP situation wouldnt be unmanageable it would only hit 25% bonus damage at that point and the ballistic damage can be mitigated in other ways 
---
Oh yeah, they’re bringing the servers right now because you said now in all caps.
---
Wait till the game is fixed, honestly. That’s a higher priority.
---
She had none of those items. The email said suspected duplication exploit but she had no massive amounts of anything in her inventory so that’s what made me confused as I said she’s kind of a noob and definitely doesn’t know how to duplicate things 
---
The OP of this thread is u/deadpelicanguy.
---
The top comment is me calling him out on his bullshit based on his own post history.
---
I thought you had followed all this since you called me a stalker. Hence why I didn't spell it out for you until now, because I thought you already noticed.
---
I respectfully disagree. It was the stacking effect the Bobbleheads where doing that is the problem. Also the weird way that shotguns triggered the explosive effect 10-20times per shot.
---
You get a duper that has 100,000 bobbleheads that increase explosive damage. Have 5 pts in demolision expert and the perk that doubles duration of bobbleheads. Then down 50 bobbleheads for +10000% explosive damage and now you have a GOD character.
---
This to me was the major issue with TSE weapons.
---
Sweet I'll check it out, just found a 3* instigating with swing speed 
---
I keep two: Excavator for loot hauling and mining. And a set of T60 for general use. I’m gonna be backing off PA for a bit though due to some balance changes affecting the M79 and Auto Grenade Launcher. 
---
Eventually I intend to farm up some X-01 armor, but I don’t think I’ll build it until I’ve secured mods I want for it. Otherwise my T60 would just outshine it, which already has mods installed.
---
A pipe pistol is going to be the new OP weapon soon....!!
---
XD
---
I might have considered this marked down to 300 Atoms.  But currently... mehn.
---
Good for you for reaching out.  There are many players out there that would love the chance to help another player out.  Best part about this game are those little moments.
---
Look at fortnite, it doesn't really have quests, or endgame, or anything other than a map, skins, and guns but it made a bajillion dollars. Basically, players killing each other IS the content. Bethesda wants it because it is easy mode development, I want it because there is no endgame and I'm bored.
---
That wasn't listed in the "inside the vault" thing, so unless you've got proof please stop spreading bullshit.
---
IMO, PvP was always intended. They just had to hold off because the game is completely unbalanced for PvP in many different ways

Charisma points increase XP?

IMO, a PvP mode is going to bring in more new players than a no-PvP mode. 
---
Heart of the Swamp is an event that makes you adjust strategy (I'm weak to rads, so when the heart sprays stuff I almost always die...), so it is interesting. I wish it would more reliably spawn the strangler blooms, though, so I can restock my radshield. Only about 25% of the time does it cause the blooms to spawn behind Dyer Chemical.
---
melee has significant downsides for both PVP and PVE namely:
---
* the strongest melee builds rely on bloodied weapons and nerd rage to do their damage so you're essentially walking around with 10-30% hp all the time
---
* you need to physically run to your target meaning you can likely be killed before you even reach your target
---
Finally isn't it nicer to have a new meta in a Bethesda game rather than the standard ranged stealth sniper in every other Bethesda game?
---
Depends on the weapon damage. If its over 1000 it will likely still hurt/kill you.
---
GT matches then mate! Haha
---
Wing me a message and an add :)
---
I found them when I was level 6 lol randomly off a scorched mob 
---
They should just ditch the extra cards completely and allow you to spec as many points as you want into a single card.
---
The only possible balance issue is that people would get a bigger variety of cards faster because they wouldn't have to choose duplicates. But that wouldn't matter much, because they still could not use those cards if they didn't have the points. It's all pretty minor impact considering you eventually get all of the cards anyway, and would make being lower level a little less painless due to the very limited card availability those players have now.
---
Yep.
---
I'll switch to melee as soon as this happens. Or leave the game, we'll see. Nice work with punishing all of your most loyal players that found late game in farmig and trading for TSE weapon, Beth.
---
Gonna have to see if its useable by team members too .
---
This is so dumb. They didn't nerf it, they stomped it into the ground. Thanks for grinding my ass off for nothing.
---
Last info was they are coming this Nov
---
How long are you sitting on the title screen? If you’re leaving the game on its title whilst AFK, surely a mute button can be pressed?
---
My carry weight goes down 5 lbs... 
---
if you pull out your weapon it closes you can see it if you go into photo mode while holding a weapon 
---
Awesome! Swing speed is possibly the most fun legendary effect I’ve found for unarmed weapons. You really feel like some insane boxer or Kung fu master barraging enemies with punches.
---
30 this year for me
---
Really struggle to play with the younger crowd though - they just annoy me to be honest
---
I switch between Aluminium, Acid, Lead and Junk based on my needs.
---
Mostly Alu, but after a while my supply on Acid runs low from the constant smeling, so I move to Acid.
---
If I'm low on lead or ammo, I move to a Lead node. Then once my supplies build up again, I move again.
---
If I get bored, I move to a junk node to just refill my stash lol. 
---
I found a mod for the GP in Watoga. I run every day to every vendor and sell junk I dont need, and i always check mods and notes. Either way, I bought the focus mod for ~150 caps alongside the maxed trade perk. But it is the first I've seen in a month. Too bad they dont have a universal one-time use "indestructible" mod. With a lvl 50 GP it's good for 2 cores and then its grind for uncommon materials to repair it.
---
Came here to say this. She's annoying. 
---
And if you do that, please also look into Grounded mutation / Class Freak broken interaction, it's always 50% energy damage reduction, even if it writes 12.5% in effects menu.
---
Because it would be an absolute waste not to take advantage of the potential for PvP in an online Action RPG set in an open post apocalyptic world where 'players are NPCs'.
---
This is actually the most likely reason.  Games like World of Warcraft, Destiny, and others have to constantly feed content players to keep them interested.  With a PvP game it’s just SOSDD but it makes money.
---
Only base in my 131 levels I've ever destroyed was there doing that garbage.
---
You can play pve on a pvp server. I did it for a couple of years on Asheron's Call. My buddy got me playing, but if I played when he wasn't around, it was very interesting. I didn't pvp at all back then. I just ran away or died and lost my equipped armor and weapon to the higher level murderer. 
---
I think this would be a great idea. In order to join the new PvP server, you have to create a new PvP character.
---
Nope intelligence, I’m fixing it now
---
Magnetic attraction.  2mm rounds.
---
I have my base in the ash heap surrounded by numerous veins (black titanium, lead, crystal, gold, iron, copper &amp; aluminium) so if I could I would love an acid node, but that ain't happening anytime soon.
---
I found the legs at Grafton so that may be the go to spot
---
Makes you wonder how widespread it really is.
---
I'm not mad, I'm just sick of unsubstantiated bullshit that later turns out to be completely false. Threads like this, threads claiming there was a "trade steal glitch", and all the other things that has since been proven false. It's almost like there's a coordinated effort to shit on this game, so unless I see proof of something I'm not believing any of these types of posts any more. 
---
The game has enough verifiable issues to complain about, we don't need people spreading more misinformation and making shit worse.
---
I was fresh out of the vault at level 2 or 3 and this guy with no audio kept giving me the follow emoji. Took me to a location for good gear and power armour chasis and left. Now I'm level 18 and people level 50 and up are killing me for whatever reason. I'm just minding my own business trying to get more ammo. Although yesterday some player left me a bag of loot after killing the grafton monster but he was probably just over overencombered and I took it lol 
---
I mean the crafted items say in their required components that need the original to craft upgrades but I can definitely see how someone could overlook that very tiny detail. 
---
reduces explosive damage for whatever reason your explosion can also deal your ballistic damage
---
Another idea might be to make all explosive effects through explosive ammo. That way people might be more inclined to not just spray and pray with auto handmades. If the ammo is difficult to come by, or expensive to craft it would be more likely to balance out. 
---
The forbidden knowledge quest is just awful,
---
Trying to grind it is a pain Diane you can only collect one piece of data at a time as well as only turn one piece in at a time, for a measly reward of 2 items , a couple of billets and some other crap? 
---
If it’s made to be grindy (to recurve the better items such as plans and BOS equipment) it should let me collect technical data as well as turn it in bulk. 
---
Events as a whole are pretty umm uneventful, Lots of time wasted for not much return , let me spend 50-60 shotgun shells to receive 5 water 5 just and a few bullets as reward 
---
IMHO pvp is being pushed to capture a younger, less mature audience. Look at Red Dead online, it’s a murderfest. I don’t believe your traditional Fallout fan is a pvp type, so these new bloods with a taste for pvp have to be captured and courted.
---
So can you confirm trading a price of technical data between 2 players will trigger the quest?
---
I have a stockpile of it, but I can’t find a way to trigger the quest other then finding a piece of technical data out in the field 
---
  
---
**So much** more grindy...
---
Using a +damage chem allows me to kill myself
---
Same here, first base, first real instance of intentional PvP in 200 hours. Shits annoying.

This nerf pisses me off too, I've been maining a TS lvl.25 Handmade rifle for 25 damn levels (just got lvl.50). I have yet to come accross a better gun for me. This game was fine for me and I never complained becuase I know the potential for this game is amazing. But HOLY FUCK bethesda give your head a shake. They're making the wrong choice here by nerfing two shot and not explosive or even buffing everything else to balance. Get a grip 
---
I usually go after bountys and if you fast travel to them it gets cut in half but if you walk to them its full
---
Some times I tab out while server hopping to check on other things and it doesn’t mute when you tab out I would love it to be an option aswell 
---
Been lurking in this sub because I love the Fallout franchise and I was excited for this game. I have not bought the game yet and honestly, the lack of pure PVE is a bigger disincentive to me than a lot of the other problems people raise.
---
The Division was one of my all time favorite games, and the devs went a similar route, making PVP the end game for what was otherwise a PVE game. The problem is, PVP isn't fun without PVE players to harass, and PVE players don't enjoy being harassed, so the whole game suffers. They balance the game for PVP, constantly nerfing and ruining PVE as a result. PVE players are essentially cattle to be preyed on by PVP players, constantly having their fun taken away in the name of balancing PVP, so they stop having fun and leave. I watched that community war internally for ages and the devs never did anything to help the PVE side. I don't want to get in to another game with the same stupid problem.
---
It's even worse in Fallout 76 because that is an existing pure PVE franchise. At least The Division was a new franchise, so if that was their vision for it, I guess it is what it is. Injecting forced PVP in to an existing beloved franchise that has never, ever, been about PVP, is much worse. I just don't get it.
---
If you can't kill the Queen with a two-shot OR explosive weapon, let alone a TSE... it ain't the weapon or the creep, my friend, it's you.
---
Depends on why you really quit playing, be it bugs, imbalances or just not your type of game.
---
I mean, three months ago was almost the first day of the beta and if your expecting a completely different game there was no point in asking the question. Of course theres still bugs and imbalances and such but if you actually want to see progress you would have kept playing to watch the game and community change as the devs slowly (but surely) fix their mistakes.
---
Cool. I've left that quest line for something to do later.
---
also sidenote , has camp budget size been discussed? think its due for an upgrade ...say 20%-30% budget increase , im level 200? Not sure how far it scales in size to level but my camp is maxed ...and I dont even use turrets ...now whenever I wanna use anew item from the shop its a matter of what I have to delete to place the new item .... 
---
Apparently so can the dogs. Was at Spruce Knob in a defend event. The last mongrel was highlighted on the ground at the bottom of the elevator. We ran over and it was gone. It had moved to the top of the elevator. Those rads are breeding some intelligent monsters. 
---
Games already buggy. Private servers would bring more issues
---
Some good updates but pretty underwhelming overall. Thanks Bethesda for keeping on top of your game. Hope you're able to make to make this Fallout worth playing for years to come.
---

does it have both bloodied and swing speed?
---
Honestly lost interest in the game when my noob ass didnt spec my special properly.  I have a great build but just wish I could tweak it a little.  
---
Where does all this anger 'stim' from?
---
Maybe this new mode is Battle Royal style?! hmmm x)
---
We enjoyed having you panic. Anytime you want to join up. 
---
And reduced weight
---
^~~~~ I'll have what there having
---
Ironically I just bought the game because I was excited to get some explosive weapons for PVE. Always get shit post nerf tbh. Feels bad man 
---
I can see that.   If the new mode drops you in as a whole new toon and is a completely separate mode that doesn’t cross over it could do well with the younger folks.  My son is a COD guy.   He tried  Fallout 3, New Vegas and 4.   Didn’t ever get far into them.   Not the instant gratification you get from a COD or Fortnite.
---
1. Change the mobs level to your level just like ESO, that way everyone wins mobs difficulty and items dropped will be catered for the players level.
---
2. Events, Invasions in areas / towns, from mob faction: scorched all types, Supermutants, Aliens, Mole miners, insects, wildlife. Think of 50 supermutants invading Watoga battling the Robots and / or players, if they win the city then watoga is locked out ie; no quests no vendors for 24 hrs.
---
3. Add in all basic plans to whitespring vendors, rare and ultra rare stay out in the real world.
---
4. Greyed out Plans and Mods at each vendor so we know that we already have it.
---
5. Implement load outs, load out can only be changed at your stash box ( thus not on the fly or in combat ) I want a melee loadouts, gun loadout, farming loadout, etc.
---
In terms of relationships to the rest of the series, it's best to think of this like Fallout Shelter. It's related in many ways, but it's not trying to set itself up as some loyal successor in the series in terms of what you do in it.
---
They made an interesting setting and set it up for players to be the source of most of the excitement that would unfold within it. Now, whether or not we have the tools to realize that potential is another story. I can fully understand that not being what a lot of series fans want - there were concerns when it was announced along those lines - but player conflict (and cooperation in those player conflicts) was featured pretty heavily in the promotion of the game.
---
These threads are being duped more than the in-game items were.
---
There should be a sticky thread that all these ideas and thoughts can go into. It might even help. Bethesda assess whether their planned nerds need tweaking, but that's not going to happen with 1000 different threads.
---
There’s ~4 dead mistresses scattered around Charleston and one in almost every town too. They’re just super easy to miss most of the time. Several are in pitch black rooms that have nothing of value or any real reason to enter aside from exploration.

mb I can send you a request. What's your ign?
---
Not if they adjust the effect appropriately.  The strength of the Explosive effect should be in the fact that it's an aoe, not that it does extra damage on top of being an aoe.  For instance they could make it so the original projectile does no damage because it explodes on impact, doing all of it's damage as just the aoe effect. Explosive weapons should be used for clearing out groups of enemies, not nuking single targets in the face.
---
I just got the mental of the Wendigo tapping its foot to elevator music while waiting for the doors to open:
---
"♫ hmm hmm Tall and tan and young and lovely
---
The girl from Ipane..♫" *ding* "Blaaaghagga!"
---
georgyfurs
---
This is how I took it as well.  Still, vague standard blanket reply seems more business as usual, than if they were like "yeah if you do that you are banned.  BANNED!  ...what was your screenname again?"
---
It would be cool if they were be able to add the pip-boy functions as well like they did for fo4.
---
I'm in game now. Join me if you're still interested. 
---
Modus has them everytime I visit if you have comand unlocked
---
I totally get that.  I think if balanced and done right if we have the tools, will be pretty damn fun.  But since they see how the community is playing, call an audible and shift some resources to additional PVE content.   
---
Kek
---
Yeah that would be awesome
---
Ranger station in cranberry bog is where I found it. 
---
Yeah I know. Seems some people are missing point. Today it's TSE. Tomorrow it's bloodied weapons. The next day it's instigating. The next day it's anti-armor. There will always be a best. And one shotting isn't difficult with any weapon type. It's just TSE was flashy and everyone had them so they got the attention.
---
You take that curse back to wherever you came from.
---
I based my entire build around not taking damage modifier perks and instead I focused on obtaining a two shot version of every weapon that I wanted so the damage would be viable at endgame. My build just took a massive hit to damage output thanks to this "solution" and I don't even use explosive weapons
---
I haven't even gotten one at all, but I think I'll stop playing in general. Was waiting for the day my noob ass could fight the SBQ, but eh it's okay now. Got other games to start, and only paid $30. 
---
tried to sent you a request. Did u get it?
---
Love it 😂
---
that is an edge case.  I've never actually seen anyone doing this personally.  
---
So yeah, I agree the bobblehead stacking issue should be fixed but what does that have to do with TSE needing a nerf or not?  
---
It's like saying I don't think TSE needed a nerf because there are clean spacesuits that are worth a lot of caps.  
---
All I see is power armor frame, terminal, and urban operative underarmor. Never gauss rifle plans
---
I usually don't like stuff thats too grindy. How grindy has it become? can i have an example?
---
Explosive legendary should not benefit from explosive perks. Otherwise every weapon can double dip EXCEPT Explosive weapons... sigh.
---
Wouldn’t be hard to make a filled shelf variant that requires you to have specific decor items in your inventory to craft the decorated shelf. Like a bobble head shelf would be a very prestigious item because you’d have to have one of each before you could craft it. 
---
This. When they announced moving special points after lvl50 I was pretty sure they meant complete respec. You gotta be able to do those things in online games. Let them be expensive, but not level-up-50-times-to-respec kind of expensive. 
---
My camp is near 3 iron nodes. My friends is near 12. So we can get 15 easily. I run Lucky hole mines with my team in excavator armor and get about 400 lead ore. 
---
The only thing we really work for anymore is acid for smelting and to make gun powder. 
---
With super duper and ammo Smith maxed bullets become super easy anymore. 
---
Dude seriously though. I wasn't aware of how much budget they took till I got rid of my turrets and got half my budget back. Was like "ok guess we're never using these again."
---
I agree with your point, real life is more important than the game. But i do think everyone's lives are their own and no one can judge. Everyone seems to have a point here.
---
Only if they make the crafting cost 10 Flux, 5 Ultracite, 3 Stealth boys and 1 Handmade Plans for every 10 rounds.
---
About 30 people have already said the exact same thing in the last eight hours.
---
Not the right terminal your in the production wing you need to go to the command wing theres also medical and science.
---
Awesome. Good thinking
---
Gauss rifle max level is 45. No level 50 exists 
---
A min
---
np just made a psa to dissuade others who are unaware from wasting their precious atoms on this (if they just wanted it for the airborne protection)
---
I'll take that over 35
---
Just to add to your point, it makes sense to stop scaling the caps after 50 because after that point you get no more new SPECIAL points when leveling up, and there is no more higher level gear.
---
Well 3 of them are under level 50 and the other 2 are under 20 so I don't think I grind all that much.  I just get bored with playing the same style for too long without switching it up. Besides, I'm trying to save them for future content because whatever is coming, I doubt it is going to be designed for level 200 people.
---
what the  majority of people like me 
---
who dont want pvp ?
---
this is going to ruin the game for many people 
---
with the grifers and all 
---
That’s true.  I was looking down the road.  Almost certainly one of the new vaults opening will focus on PVP.   I just hope the game evolves in both directions.  I enjoy playing both PVP and co op PVE.   I would hate for all their development plans to be in PVP.
---
Always been one of my favorite parts of any Fallout game. They've had those details in all of the others. Just now, they're the central focus instead of a bonus.
---
Do not nerf two shot. I can understand nerfing explosive as the damage and needs some tweaking. I would prefer the following:
---
1) the legendary effect "explosive" no longer benefits from explosive damage modifications (e.g. perk cards).
---
2) you cannot have explosive and two shot on the same weapon. 
---
I really think weapon legendary prefixes should have 1 direct damage option, 1 damage variance option, and 1 weapon use option. 
---
For example, A 3 star legendary hunting rifle could like this:
---
Two-shot
---
50% Armor penetration 
---
50% reload speed
---
OR...
---
Explosive
---
25% increased critical damage
---
Increased accuracy in vats 
---
Personally, i do not enjoy explosive however it sounds like Bathesda are making two shot damn near useless.
---
Also, like others have pointed out in this post and others, there is a significant amount of bullet sponge mobs in this game.
---
“See you get it get it,  The Bethesda Charm, thank you”!
---
Exactly 
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
If your a Master Chef.
---
I just wanted to point out nerf got autocorrected to nerd, just like my post earlier. Be careful with your planned nerds.
---
Considering how badly balanced weapon types are right now I expect to see a lot of changes up and down.
---
Check again. They made an update to the "Inside the Vault." 
---
Yes! I've said this too. Or make a couple side quests to collect all bobbleheads/bears/mr fuzzies and make the reward upon completion the ability to craft a filled display. 
---
One static object, no server issues. 
---
If you can get the stealth boy mod for the x-01 you could have a stealth build. I just use the jetpack for the x-01 though
---
Thank you very much!
---
Too late, it's getting nerfed. Move on. 
---
We've gone through shock, denial and anger but now we've entered bargaining
---
I assumed the hunting lodge with all the mutated animal plaques was from those psychos who hunted humans prewar and holed up there and kept hunting before eventually joining/forming the Trappers raider gang. 
---
I don’t crash. Fix your shit 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
It makes me more efficient.
---
This will force me to switch to my TSE from a TS even though I dont want to use a TSE.
---
Theyre only nerfing the explosive mod not actual explosive weapons like the fatman, but I think those perks will stay the same, except with a full rank of demolition it will probably get the damage up to the level that it currently is without. A 75% nerf is pretty substantial imo
---
Lol, take my upvote, I will make sure only to use spontaneous nerds in the future.
---
Unless you’ve broken the green pact, I don’t think you’d want to wear wood armor?
---
I hope they pay close attention to player numbers also as they are making these changes.
---
PC? Can add a line to the config .ini file to shut it up.  
---
I myself tired of it almost immediately. 
---
Na, I like where it's at.
---
I like the junk node at the Gorge Junkyard. Might need to find one for my camp as well.
---
I thought I heard 40%. But what people have been saying is that even FP2 + Dense was enough to negate explosive damage.
---
Looks like we may need more rigorous testing... 
---
I have a level 50 blaster.
---
Bingo
---
vats consumption in PA seems like it needs a serious rebalance otherwise you can try using the perk to extend the life of your fusion cores and potentially look at moving your base to next to a place with multiple fusion core spawn points (would recommend near dyer chemical as the sewers have 3-5 fusion cores from memory)
---
Ok so I read it like this:
---
Let’s say you have a TSE shotgun, whose normal non legendary form would deal 100 damage. Ok, two shot takes that up 25% to 125. 
---
Explosive takes base damage and adds 100% of it as additional explosive damage, currently on live servers. Nerfed form makes that only 20% of base damage(125 after Two Shot) as explosive, or 25 explosive. But wait! You got Demo expert that boosts all explosive damage by 100% right? So double that explosive damage of 20 to get 50. Add that explosive goodness to your normal bullet damage and that is 175.
---
Old prenerf with a 100 damage shotgun: 200 for two shot, another 200 explosive for the legendary explosive, or 400 with demo expert, for 600 total if bullets hit, and 400 blast damage if you completely miss but hit with the explosions only.
---
Major note! Total explosive AOE damage in the nerfed version is gonna be only 50, down from 400. The damage inflicted if you miss a shot is gonna be much much lower.
---
TL;DR - total damage will be reduced to 29% of current damage. 
---
Listen, I’m the person it happened to. I’m aware it encourages pvp. I have no problem with pvp. I have a problem with the fact that it takes MY caps when I’m one shot killed while at my camp. I wasn’t even at the workshop. I was at my camp, in the middle of nowhere. So they hunted me down for no reason. I don’t give a flying fuck about the workshops, except to take them for plans and XP. Take the workshop and move on. No need to find and kill me. It also shouldn’t cost me MY caps. Especially when I don’t even get to fight back. And if we just go around blocking everyone, what exactly does that solve?  Where is this fun for people?  Except those that are getting all the caps?  The pvp should be over the workshop, not at my camp, multiple times costing me my caps. That’s what is stupid. The fact that after all of that I have no caps because people one shot kill me. That’s not pvp. There is no element of vs anyone when you can kill everyone in one shot.  This is the first time I’ve been seriously pissed with this game. This is not an environment conducive to pvp or fair play. I hope come private servers the game improves. 
---
the .50 cal hunting rifle is 2 damage less than the hardened 308.... still trying to figure that one out
---
Usually a junk node because I can get a little bit of everything 
---
I agree. There has to be a healthy amount of both.
---
I'd say more emphasis on PvE actually, since once they have a good working PvP system up and running, it should basically take care of itself. Players can make their own fun in those regards, and they've got quite the sandbox to do it in.
---
PvE content however needs more a helping hand from Bethesda, and should be the biggest source of actual new content moving forward.
---
 No. It would make people look for a new dupe method and then people would sell millions of Explosive rounds 
---
I agree, and even PvP needs that additional PvE content to keep things rolling (no point in kicking people out of an area unless it controls access to some valuable kind of spawn, and the current batch is getting a little worn out). I worry that the development plans might mean there isn't much support to build much of that, though. I think things like the Child's Play event is about as deep as weekly events were planned to be, for example.
---
And half-pieces of floor with the tilesets available in the shop...
---
Lead, but ONLY if it's near a place I find aesthetically pleasing. I'd prefer no resources at all over being in a place I don't like. For me,  that's usually near a body of water. 
---
Sounds good to me.  I'm constantly overencumbered and walk everywhere, even in power armor.  I did about ten perk cards to reduce item weights too and have pocketed armor.  
---
Lol what was a challenge anyway?
---
damit. Well, we gotta wait then. If I may ask you to hold this axe for me, I'd be very much pleased. I promise to buy it :)
---
No it sure doesn’t. All that’s encouraged is duping and bullying and trolls. 
---
Go to the computer and request the government ID 
---
It will definitely give other Legendary effects more use
---
The universe is encouraging you to do a unarmed build.
---
Sure
---
Better idea, give us the ability to move a legendary effect from one piece to another of the same equip slot, destroying the first piece (and any other leg effects that were on it).
---
I need farm material and now my character doesn't lvl up either I don't get new cards.
---
Obviously, this didn’t happen at a workshop, they hunted me down at my camp. My problem is the fact that it takes my caps when they one shot kill me. I don’t even get to fight back. It’s not really pvp. 
---
Xbox one. 
---
Since last patch our friends lists keep coming up blank, telling us one of us isn't accepting requests to team. And when we can sometimes manage to team up the "ask to join team" option never goes away from the other players body. 
---
They still haven't addressed that randomly during play teammates go invisible. Sometimes just a name shows. Other times I can see the player but not their name above them. And on occasion it will show a team mates name twice. Once far away from where we are and then the accurate one above them. 
---
If I know I am ever gonna PvP, I just spend all my caps on stimpacks or radaway. I still don't have money, but at least I have something to use or liquidate after.
---
How about instead of producing Nuka-Colas, it produces "Bootleg Nuka-Colas." It provides the same benefits as a Nuka-Cola, but it won't give a Cap when drunken and won't get benefits from the Cola Nut perk. It's also less valuable to sell at Vendors.
---
There you go. That's how you balance this kind of workshop out.
---
It's not properly placed then, that shouldn't happen. Try setting up cross lines of fire for three turrets in a triangle shape 
---
Hehe. You got me.
---
Well the bug was helping you with only one currently equipped core, so it wouldn't make much of a difference with the queen. My best guess is to just use the perk for extended core duration, but i'm not even sure if it works with vats consumption
---
Agreed, I've double purchased armor plans multiple times on accident.
---
understnadble sorry if i was misguided :).
---
Have a great day
---
One. One single chassis. I also usually keep my stash weight under 400, still. 
---
Command wing is just gatling laser/plasma plans
---
Don’t care about losing junk, I care about losing my caps and the fact that I can’t even fight back because they one shot kill me. It shouldn’t cost my caps when they kill me over a workshop. That’s stupid. This isn’t pvp. There’s no back and forth so it’s not pvp. There’s no versus anything. 
---
 I got it to run again but it was so bad I just put it away. 
---
 They need to get their network crap in order. I was well connected throughout the whole afternoon but have beed shut down many times. I lost about a hours good loot to the last one.
---
 I played ESO for years and we never had anything like this. They, or perhaps Amazon, needs to get some shit fixed or else I won't be able to play it.
---
No, I think that's just some junk related to a nearby boat that some guy used to kill another guy. The behemoth is in another lake across the mountain range to the west. 
---
Not when you can't lvl up or games keep crashing on you.
---
Does this work with other explosive weapons like grenade launchers or Fatman? Because I would really enjoy not killing myself.
---
Well then other people think it too I guess 
---
I'm on Xbox and they grey it out if I don't have enough caps as well.
---
I love that it stayed quiet for so long, i'm just now hearing about this. Wonder how it compares to a tse minigun.
---
Some guns are pretty much worthless without the TS effect. The LMG and Gatling Laser are prime examples. Both have base damage below 20 and no possible mods that I’ve seen yet for armor piercing, and the perk for armor piercing only works when in power armor. 
---
Are TSEs OP?  Absolutely. Did that require nerfing every TS weapon?  He’ll no!  
---
Its there.
---
Yeah but it looks so terrible 
---
Has anyone found the VTU Jacket or Hat yet?
---
 I still don't buy the "let's exclude human npc's for realism" excuse. It makes no sense. Then why not ghouls? There are killer feral ghouls all about so why not a few non-feral ones to talk to?   
---
I think it was a resource crunch. NPCs take time, money, animators, and voice actors to put in a game. Things they didn't have enough of apparently when they rushed this baby out.
---
They’re always open to suggestions the community has. I just want my tse gatling plasma to be decent
---
I'm the ammo crafter for my whole team. We all collect mats and pool together, but I've invested heavily into the crafting cards and they didnt. If making a lot of ammo gets you banned then I'm fucked. 
---
I checked all 3, none of them had it
---
Any explosive rifle is basically a missile launcher that uses normal ammo and weights a lot less so it definitely deserves a nerf. That being said, i agree they should definitely rebalance weapon dmg, legendary mods, bullet sponge enemies and mostly perks (like for example why the fck woule someone not take demolition expert which gives a +60% i think at rank 3 while modern renegade gives +4% crippling chance and accuracity even in a gun build????)
---
So is the damage bonus on the TSE that's being reduced an inherent bonus, or are they talking about Explosives Expert perk?
---
Better get on your knees and pray to RNGesus
---
I thought this was common knowledge as the effect was present in FO4 too iirc. 
---
eh with the right outfit it can look pretty cool, but I would definitely like more options in this field (sentry bot helmet please)
---
I have a ghoul slayers meat hook with the third hook it's probably my favorite weapon in the game. If you invest in the perks to increase swing speed it's just amazing. 
---
Check command again hoo till its there its there abd I've seen it dozens of times
---
Just found out it sells the weapon itself, was trying to get plans, but ok
---
Good you survived. Whenever a wendigo eats another person, it grows in proportion to the meal it has just eaten, so it can never be full. Therefore, wendigos are portrayed as simultaneously gluttonous and extremely thin due to starvation. 
---
Uh yes I have them 200 extra pounds carry weight
---
The one thing we all know we want, and we’ve been asking for it since BETA. 
---
I wish this was a priority to Bethesda rather than nerfing. 
---
It doesn't really align to the story. Everything else you generate isn't premade. It's either a natural material kind of e.g. Acid and concrete, wood etc or is being topped up, e.g fusion cores.
---
Nuka cola along with food like snack cakes etc were all made before the great war hence why the caps are valuable as currency.
---
If they could still make them the story doesn't work anymore. Furthermore the caps would have no value as the bottles would be common.
---
If you need better health make some food
---
You on ps4? I’ll make you one.
---
Here is the video:

I can hear the *twack* that things make when you completely kill them, but none of the things you would expect from a tambo.
---
Xbox
---
It would be nice if bandanas also granted the effect.
---
I did not realize when this person hunted me down at my camp that they were attacking me over the workshops. So yeah I retaliated. Because, pvp so I figured I’d play along. But I didn’t realize I was losing my caps. The pvp isn’t my issue, let me clear that up for you and make it simple. What I’m pissed about and don’t understand is the fact that me dying and being killed in ONE SHOT with out a chance to fight back, costs me MY caps. That shouldn’t be the case. I shouldn’t lose caps. That’s what’s broken. I’ve been one shot before. I could care less. Junk can be found again.  It’s not really pvp when you die in one shot, you’re not actually able to engage in combat with the other person. 
---
Sorry man.  It took me awhile to get the plan from the enclave vendor.  It should show up eventually.  
---
Lol indeed
---
Ha
---
Yeah, I'm loving it so far. With the 40% swing speed on it plus martial arts is just ridiculous. One shotting majority of things in nuke zones. 
---
I feel your pain
---
Why are you on the sub if you hate the game and player so much 
---
Nah, I found one that sells the weapon itself 
---
Given that the patch proposal was modified within an hour of them announcing it, I'm pretty sure there is a lot that has been forgotten (or has never been learned).
---
Glowing Ghouls at Whitesprings was the go-to for xp 400xp each or so
---
Now they’re 100xp or so
---
You can’t server hop for items. World loot items have a 20hr cooldown before they can be looted again
---
Vendors still fucking suck and server hopping is the only ~~viable~~ tedious way outside of third party market places like r/market76 or r/fo76bazaar
---
More often than not, I’m on an acid node to smelt the loot from “Breach and Clear” and “Lode Baring”. 
---
 You need all the regular Combat Armor. The BOS Combat Armor stuff is a mod to that.
---
Afaik it only affects heavy attack
---
The clean Fireman's Helmet sold.by... Cap'n Kidd! Is also -2 perception free, and it looks exactly like the Firebreathers helmet
---
I have 12 points banked and usually keep around 10
---
The people most upset about it are the people who don't know how to build decent characters or use varied strategies, and who wanted an quick, cheap, easy way to make the game easy on them.
---
It bleeds when you hit it too.
---
How'd you get the monster mask? I need it
---
I stopped using turrets altogether. I used to have my camp in the cranberry bog but the dragons got to be a bit much. Now I'm in a more secluded area but right on a spawn point for level 18-40 radtoads. They harass my junk collector a bit but other than that they just lick my walls. More of a nuisance than a threat and its free meat to cook and sell. Haven't needed actual defenses in a while. On PC so no real issues with griefers.
---
Turn up your headset.
---
I would prefer if they just made wood armor not garbage. Give it some valuable base resistances like poison or some shit.
---
The stuff looks cool, and I hate assets that already exist in game being wasted on utterly worthless stuff. 
---
I’m happy for the most part with my luck stat of 11 I have full starched genes, class freak, and bloody mess along with one level of the ammo scrounger perk and pharma farmer perk which I will eventually get rid of
---
I want quests that don't hold your hand all the way instead of events.
---
If you engage in PvP, no matter how many shots it takes to kill you you should absolutely lose caps.
---
If they one shot you without you engaging in PvP, then I completely agree, but instead of changing it so you don't lose caps they need to fix the stacking item abuse that allows people to one shot kill on slap damage.
---
I'm sorry I don't speak senseless cunt. I awesome you need evidence: \[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/Zap5hSp.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Zap5hSp.jpg)) 
---
Make sure when you go to the Xbox home screen you manually quit the game. This will refresh it and not try to load what it was last stuck loading. 
---
Bloodied is top. Hands down. People are ignorant to what's really op. Here's a clue. It's not weapons. 
---
Bolt stuck but the nut got off...
---
I have one of each except for raider. 
---
X-01 targeting hud, jet pack, Tesla bracers, optimized servos (can’t find CS)
---
T60 targeting hud, motion assist servos, (looking for jet pack) calibrated shocks
---
T51 targeting hud, jet pack, hydraulic bracers (looking for rest of mods
---
T45 targeting hud, Tesla coils, (want jet pack) calibrated shocks
---
Excavator targeting hud, Tesla coils, calibrated shocks
---
Ultracite looking for all mods besides rusty knuckles and explosive vents hahaha. 
---
Also have an x01 stealth boy, not sure what I’m going to do with it though. 
---
It's a glitch now where even tho you have the materials it won't let you craft certain things
---
Monorail, monorail, monorail......
---
I thought intelligence could only be boosted to 25 max.
---
That sounds like something shelbyville might be more interested in
---
Sweet didn't know about this one will check it out :)
---
Damn, just posted and you beat me to it! Well done sir
---
I found the plans at the BoS bot vendor in Watoga but they're pretty uncommon there. Only once in dozens of visits over weeks of playtime.
---
Both of these are good ideas to try, I'll go ahead and give it a go and see if I can make it sustainable.
---
I have to say I honestly dont understand the whole vats using core mechanic, what are you using when you use vats outside of power armor?
---
Gonna file this under "Shit I wish I knew a month ago".
---
That’s the thing, if they one shot kill me, I don’t get to engage in pvp!  I was in the middle of building the first time!  I didn’t even know it was over the workshop so yeah, I kept seeking revenge. Why lose caps in pvp tho if I didn’t initiate?  And if I didn’t even get to fight back?  Why should I have to lose caps?  
---
I've got a correction though.   
---
There are people who love fallout, but hate fallout 76, and then there are people who just hate fallout. Two different groups.   
---
Personally I love fallout (have since the start) and played the hell out of every version. But this is just one I can't stand. There's no real story and no real NPC's. I don't even like it as a survival game due to the limited building options and the fact that nothing you do changes the game world.   
---
I'm not going to hate on anyone for liking the game for whatever reasons they like it for. To each their own. Have fun.   
---
I do however believe that Bethesda needs to be held accountable for their mistakes with this game.  And that unless it's hammered home, they're going to repeat these mistakes with Fallout 5 and the next Elder Scrolls game. Mostly I think we need to know what happened, why did it happen, and who was responsible. That way we know which actual specific game designers/writers we should NEVER buy games from again. I mean if I ever see the name Doug Mellencamp on a game again, I'm OUT.   
---
Yeah he lost his head on me the other day. Same with the girl at the camp by the radio station. 
---
Durability up to 100% rather than dropping mostly broken needing repairs
---
&gt; I do not work for Bethesada
---
Username does not check out :P ^^^^^But.I.believe.you.OP
---
no m8 its on the servers end ive had this happen 5 times so far nearly all due to server lag
---
I had that happen once.  Was killing ghouls at white springs and this weird one in power armor came up, could emote and everything. 
---
Obviously I couldn't let it live or it would teach the others.  Apparently they know how to send psn hatemail too...
---
Ghouls are weird like that.
---
He sells the plans....
---
Yeah this sub is so full of hate. I actually think its great and in a new class of games. This sub has a lot of haters and instead on any discussion about how good the game is or cool spots to visit, its all 'letters to Bethesda'
---
The work around sometimes would work on PC, but if one got disconnected from the server, the entire team would have to completely exit the game and re-enter to form the team. Also the server disconnection seems to be more frequent since the last patch, don’t know why.
---
Sounds like the language of the ignorant if you ask me, this is a slippery slope we are heading down, and Bethesda cares more about the opinions of the casual whiner than the players that actually min/max and know what is op. Let me give you a little hint, it's not any weapon you can equip.duping made it a huge issue don't get me wrong, but the weapons being as rare as they were meant to be would have never see such a mass of complaints from people who were unlucky or refused to put the time in to farm.
---
Some good ideas I hope they implement. But I think two shot and explosive need to stay down, still. Nothing you recommended will correct the main issue TSE guns have now. That being, they make high damage explosive AOE effects too easy to access.
---
Not for me
---
F
---
Bloodied is strong if you like being low health all the time but I personally don't like that play style all I was saying was that compared to the lever action the gauss rifle is quite a bit higher damage.
---
Thats kinda a no brainer honestly
---
Taking a workshop is PvP. You need to always be on guard, the warning is there. Anyone who wants to take the workshop can PvP you without you returning fire when you own a workshop, it even warns you when you take one.
---
If you were seeking revenge after, then you kept engaging so it seems that you created your own issue.
---
People are not getting how workshops work a lot, maybe they need to have a better warning.
---
I just tested it the other day for someone elses question by swapping the perks to be sure.  The 10mm smg is with the commando perk.  It fits with their description because it is a two handed weapon.  The 10mm auto pistol is in the Guerilla perk.
---
I found the .45 submachine gun to be better with Commando, but the 10mm smg is a good complement for using common ammo.  The best was a handmade auto.  Make sure to run Tormentor, which makes the build work.  Even works on scorchbeasts and SBQ.
---
Exactly all they had to do was decouple it from demo perk and bobble without that TES aren't stronger than a middling melee build. It is absurd and this is coming from a primarily melee character because ranged are already weak as hell unless you really minmax, buff, and devote most your perks to it.  Moves like this have killed any trust in devs in other games. 
---
Meh. Fallout has a lot more panda fanatics than gearbox.
---
Yep. He usually spawns at my camp in the mire. Like inside of it...or only pieces of him sometimes
---
Oohhhhhh... Yes 
---
I run into them near the treehouse village in the Mire sometimes, not so much in the Bog except scorched ones during the SBQ fight.
---
Time to do more research!
---
If i spend 25 years in a vault with the same people, i will kill atleast 8 of them.
---
Was stuck on a job for 2 weeks with this annoying coworker. Trust me, after 25 years you will kill them on sight.
---
Ok so you know math, it's apparently the mechanics you don't understand.  
---
Super Duper procs based on base crafting amount. 100*2=200+80 (from ammosmith) = 280.  
---
If you don't believe it, put all your 5mm in storage, and craft a single batch until it procs with super duper (obviously keep putting the non super duper batches in storage as well). You'll see it's 280. 
---
Provide Bethesda with this feedback, as this is exactly what they are looking for right now.
---
You bet your ass there will be.  They're going to leak skins out over YEARS
---
Thanks, I've only been there once i'll go check that area.
---
I haven't ran into many problems (PS4 Pro, newest version). There was a day after the patch where I had a couple in fairly quick succession, but not one blue screen since.
---
not to mention you gotta put 5 points in demolition to get a 20% bonus to explosives now...not worth the perks ...5 points equal 100% bonus in my eyes...
---
I saw the warning yeah. No I guess I didn’t realize how it worked. I didn’t think I’d be freaking hunted down for the damn Poseidon energy plant. Like, just take it. Like I said though, first time this has happened. Yeah I know better now. I won’t be seeking revenge. I thought it was regular old pvp, didn’t realize it was over the workshop. Tbh I forgot about the workshops, I never go back to them because I don’t care about them. I wish actually I could get rid of them but I guess I have to leave the world for that. 
---
As a shotguns build with 11 luck this is my primary source of income.
---
High condition double barrels and combat shotguns sell for 20-60 caps a piece, and weigh less than a pound for me. 
---
Found both, just got another one a few minutes ago :)
---
i have it happen at least once or twice per session sometimes more
---
I currently have 4. My old T60, my X01 that I wear,  my Excavator and my almost complete set of Ultracite (need helmet plans). 
---
I know scorched ones can spawn during the queen fight
---
Pre-patch I was getting 15-20 a day during a 6-8 hour play session. 
---
Post-patch I get 2-3. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/lSMUIuS.png
---
What a great idea! Tweet it and email it to them!
---
If I understand correctly, TSE's are so OP because the damage is essentially calculated wrong. They are essentially taking an AoE explosive effect, that should probably have never have been that powerful to begin with, and then *doubling* it. When in reality it should have been calculated as Two-shot = 2x weapon damage + AoE effect. It's not a manner of nerfing the flavor of the month like WoW. It's fixing a literally broken weapon. It should be fixed regardless of how it performs compared to other weapons.
---
I get them often in my stash. I've seen them *significantly* more often in the new patch.
---
Happening to me a ton. 
---
Oddly enough I run into them all the time by the Welch vendor 
---
Thats part of the fun! Doing PvE with the risk of real danger
---
I know, I'm just spinning your daddy pants. Sometimes you can only hear people when on a team, sometimes you stop hearing them when you join a team. Try to saddle up with a buddy and see if y'all can hear through the ear. 
---
On one hand that’s awesome!! On the other I hate you! 😂 I still have not had any luck with them! Been looking for them since the B.E.T.A.
---
nerfs are made to force players to play more, not to balance the game. we should expect nothing more than this. 
---
no problem
---
The complete opposite has happened to me. 
---
Same problems happen to us on PC as well, the fact console players and PC players are having the same issues clearly shows Bethesda Support’s reply is irresponsible and unprofessional. 
---
There’re also times the friend list wrongly assign an offline player’s name to another online player. 
---
1200 caps or $6USD
---
I had pretty serious bluescreen issues on my PS4 pro. It was about one an hour.
---
I tried rebuilding the database but that didn't help.
---
What did help was uninstalling, rebooting the PS4 and then doing a clean install.
---
I have stil had one bluescreen since but the improvement is significant and I managed to play for 3 hours straight for the first time in a while.
---
I suspect that it has something to do with installing the patches rather than installing the whole patched game in one shot but hard to really say. I'm just happy it worked.
---
Haha right? Those were the good old days. I probably spent 100 hours faction grinding getting my Iksar to be able to walk through Freeport. Simpler times. 
---
&gt;honor
---
You lost me. 
---
Made me laugh.
---
I love this, it's amazeballs. The Nuka Cola Quantum made me lol
---
It'll be funny when melee gets hit next and everyone is saying the exact same thing about you. Right now ranged weapons are a joke compared to melee, and if you're one shot by an explosive weapon, you aren't countering it properly. Explosive and two shot were pretty much NECESSARY to keep up in DPS. People were complaining about TSE weapons killing them in pacifist and they are so op this and that. What everyone seemed to be too ignorant to realize is that BOBBLEHEADS are the reason. Not a two shot explosive. Exploiters will kill you still, just need 4x the bobbles.
---
They are punishing everyone for the crimes of some. I legitimately obtained a TSE lever action and have sold and thrown away other legendaries that may now be better. I feel cheated out of my reward. I don't feel like a privilege was taken, I feel like I worked for nothing.
---
It's always given me 360, superchief. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Yeah that's probably a better explanation. 
---
Because not all players want to be forced into pvp. The pacifist mode is broken. If you go pacifist no one should be able to kill you imo. Granted if you have certain perks avoiding players can be easy. But you shouldnt have to deal with people trying to kill you when you are trying to just chill and do missions or events if that's what you want. Me I dont mind pvp. I dont care for pvp with strangers though, just fun duels with friends for a good laugh.
---
What platform are you on? If you have the mats I'll craft you one
---
Weird how its very rare to have blue screens for me
---
I did the same with UC 308 to get rid of all the damned fluorescent flux I was getting from nuked Whitesprings. I was making it before I even had a gun that used it. Bandolier made it pretty much weightless.  Same for UC 44. The ones that took violet were the only ones I didn’t. 
---
Hmm be interested to see after this nerf event if it goes up
---
maybe, does the space suit helmet grant the same imunitys
---
I keep seeing this melee weapons hit for 5k I use melee and I dont think I hit anywhere near that the weapon tool tip says it hits for something close to 300 and I have almost every melee perk. Is this getting to 5k done by stacking consumables and sneak ? 
---
He’s giving it a bit of the PB Blaster. 
---
Refer to the edit
---
Really really hate that explosive nerf. It's the only thing on guns that actually does good dmg on enemies considering they're all super spongy on high levels. Really shitty they're nerfing it but oh well. 
---
Eh...so your solution is to nerf more stuff? 50% total boost is a massive nerf to demo expert. Why is that necessary?
---
Just run a 2 rank demo expert. That’s 40%, close to what you want anyway.
---
But see that really sounds more like the weapons themselves needing a buff rather than them absolutely needing a specific legendary effect to be viable.
---
She’s got a lovely personality though. 
---
So if I build combat armor I can then mod it to bos
---
I think it looks pretty [good](https://i.imgur.com/7jloaWg.jpg).
---
Well unless they can somehow stop you in anyway or damper your experience in fallout 76 there is no way they can ruin it for you.
---
Instigating is good on snipers for one shot, don't get me wrong, not disputing you in any way, I wanted to get the effect out there. On a side note though your current hp means nothing if you take no damage lol.
---
Played last night for around 5 hrs crashed approx 6 times, decided to Rebuild ps4, ( just like defrag on PC ) Number 5 in options I think it was took 3 mins, didn't crash at all for 3 hrs playing after that. Either it helped or I got lucky.
---
Yes because the secret service would never use stealth or be constantly wired into a grid (vats) and they all use miniguns right?
---
Did you answer the survey on the official forums?  This is one of the questions.
---
I get 2-4 per session. Hasn't changed since the update.
---
It's by using the right legendary effects, gear, and perks.

While I agree that the explosive two shot combo is strong, I strongly disagree with it being removed or even heavily nerfed, I farmed for hours on top of hours sold off goods to vendors every day for my 1400 caps to get my hands on got teir weapons because I enjoy them and also I hate how enemies are literal bullet sponges in this game for most of game you put 100's of rounds into one fucking enemy when its already a pain to gather the resources to build ammo. Now I don't know whether the op is just jealous because he doesn't have one or he genuinely dislikes one shotting most enemies, but I cannot say it enough JUST ADDING HP to an enemy doesn't make it harder or more fun its stupid.  Not only that everyone is whining about two shot explosive what about melee? Have you seen any videos on youtube of someone 10 shotting the SBQ with a gun? no ,but melee can do that, if you are gonna nerf ranged nerf melee as well because that is 10X stronger, ESPECIALLY in pvp where you both have to hit each other to engage a range player has no chance even if he as a tse because the melee player is in your face and you can't use those weapons in close quarters.
---
And vertical half walls dammit!
---
Ill give you 10,000 caps
---
Step 7: Get banned for essentially having become a duper to deal with a duper
---
:^
---
Can definitely see how that can happen, people are using the workshop mechanic to surprise people just like you were. 
---
Heads up. This weapon is duped to hell and back, there are thousands of this exact weapon out there, same effects and all. I just hate to see people go uninformed
---
What event are you having the best luck getting them from? I’ve been trying to farm Collision Course and Fertile Soil. 
---
I might be wrong, but I think it's just the home defense and fireproof perk cards. The only defense that has it's own plans that I am certain of (because I can't build it) is the radiation emitter.
---
HEY! Look! Listen! 
---
https://twitter.com/i/status/1086083667708076032
---
I 100% support this, lets nerf guns and other items not even in the notes to balance the end game.  I love Fallout 3, NV, &amp; 4.  I just dont think 76 will make that cut.
---
He,y why is the marine assault helmet in the secret dev room but not the full game?
---
I seriously use nades for all tough enemies. It only takes a couple shotgun blasts and a MIRV for me to kill most Deathclaws. This takes aiming and planning and a specific build and doesn’t work on all enemies and situations. I don’t see why it’s necessary to nerf it.
---
Save the nades!
---
I’m already one-shotting all non-legendary mobs as it is. 
---
I've just been sticking to events which seem to be the fastest to complete, which usually means constant fertile soil. Just looking for the camp jumpsuit now.

Evga 1080 Ti, X299 with 7740X @ 5 Ghz, 16 gigs 3000 ram, Aio on cpu... should Not have stuttered. Forgot to add this, my max temp cpu/gpu was even 42C, not system/user side as it usually is.
---
Had this happen with a wendigo the other day. The invisible enemy bug I've encountered before, sure. But not one that looked like he was wearing a stealth boy. Laughed my ass off. 
---
I have a two shot gauss rife and it feels pretty well balanced. Its a good weapon but not too powerful.
---
I like playing 'Mysterious Stranger' when I see a low or mid-level player in a hazardous region. It's fun to follow at a distance in stealth with Chameleon armor equipped and a suppressed scoped lever-action rifle and snipe off wounded enemies if they get overwhelmed.

Goodbye

Ok so your saying super end game items you have the perfect everything I'm going to guess you also mean the unyielding stuff that you need to be 20% health to get full effects ect right
---
It has plans and requires the perks
---
No, it hasn't. Because it's not coded that way. But continue to assume so, since you've never actually looked and just don't want to admit you're wrong. 
---
I was passing through Grafton and ran into a levek 13 that was getting swarmed by the super mutants there. I picked a weaker weapon to make sure they got some tap damage for the xp and helped out. They were really low on hp the entire time, so I assume they had no stimpaks, and had that theory confirmed when they went down. Hit them with a heal, helped clean up, dropped them 10 stimpaks and all the plan dupes I had on hand and went on my merry way. Felt good to help out!
---
That would be pretty cool honestly. Most game are doing that these days because it brings in a lot of players. I’m not a fan of battle royal too much but having it in fallout 76 would be pretty fun if it’s tweaked in some ways.         
---
        
---
(Random thought )          
---
A lot of battle royals are free....
---
It happened to me as well. I just waited a little while, walked away, came back, and then it worked. 
---
Yeah, it's not cheating but it is a type of exploit given they probably don't know that they don't show up hostile to the people they're doing it to. I'm mostly saying it's just an annoying bug for the victims of it and trying to explain to those claiming cheater why it's happening instead of the current defense being "oh you don't know how workshops work" which technically...that's not how they're supposed to work they're supposed to trigger pvp which they kind of do but it only appears that way for the guy triggering it not the ones that are getting killed.
---
I'm agreeing with OP that people need to stop shouting "CHEATER" and start thinking well maybe there's some weird bug here. It took me some time of recording these people and watching closely from the teammate point of view what's happening to figure it out but people would rather get mad than spend the time to learn what's happening. It's a bug with the hostile player system simple as that and the people who suffer are those that play with passive mode on all the time. 
---
For the people shouting CHEATER: if you see your workshop is being taken don't go to it and turn off passive mode immediately because these people are going to try to kill you. I'd also stealth and get out of power armor; their weapons will shred through it. If you're low level: hop servers since they're going to hunt you easily. If you're high level: it's your choice if you want to fight but you gotta turn off passive mode, know they'll probably take first blood since you won't hit them hard right off the bat, and you'll probably lose your level of caps to them.
---
Fair point, wasn't taking duping into account. 
---
Unless you pay some goddamned attention and use sentinel assassin or cavalier assassin and quit being a crybaby. Melee weapons should not do ten times the damage of a rifle to give you a fair advantage because of range. It isn't realistic. Why the hell would you use a stick when you can use a gun? Not the other way around. And I would think melee users would be the most knowledgeable on defensive options, Jesus Christ.
---
So why you all blah blah blah about it then?
---
You were right, i revised it. As well as the charisma section.
---
Yea I think I was the anomaly both times. Pre-patch none of my friends believed someone could get as many blue screens a day as I did. Now they are like wtf you weren't lying, and meanwhile I'm like oh you guys also weren't lying about hardly getting any.
---
And noobs rely on pacifist, I take zero damage even in full on combat you noob.
---
kinda obvious they don't
---
Sure. That's not my point though.  If Bethesda goes with the idea of discounting the fast travel cost to an event (which without a discount is the same cost as fast traveling to the place the event is at), anyone wanting to FT a decent distance will start going to the closest event instead, then walking/FTing a 2nd time the rest of the way to where they were planning to go anyway, having gotten a discount compared to directly going where they wanted to go.  There is no way to do a discount event FT and restrict it to only people who were actually planning to do the event.   Having a bunch of people cycle through an extra FT step and spawning in temporarily at the event area is actually detrimental - costs server resources for the extra FT (spawn in/spawn out for all clients) and could bump up the event level for lower level people actually planning to do it. Sort of like how Whitesprings is almost always high level mobs now despite having low level content also present.
---
Not arguing that they don’t need a buff, but the TS effect is what made them even remotely viable as is, and now that’s going to be gone.  In their effort to fix a major PvP and duping issue, they’ve taken a crap on everyone who is using regular TS guns, which aren’t really OP unless paired with the explosive effect. 
---
_The only ammunition I've produced is 5mm._
---
It’s happened twice since this post. It’s only in Whitesprings and Watoga, and it’s when I sprint.  
---
This is a 3 month old PS4, with a ton of free space, and this every other game I have runs without any problems whatsoever. I don’t get it. I rebuilt the database as others have said, I reinstalled the game and still the same shit over and over again. 
---
I am very upset about the nerf to two shot. Explosive definitely deserved it but two shot makes or breaks some builds. It really let sniper builds shine through now that we have legendary rifles and allowed shotguns to go from a garbage weapons to extremely desirable even without explosive. 
---
 Hopefully this doesn’t make the slower weapons unusable again, but I feel it might  
---
Was Clara playing on your computer?
---
With legendary armor and a lot of the end game perks i find I only really need pa for nuke zones. I used it a ton while leveling. But as a stealth vats sniper with a few choice mutations I kill almost anything before they even realize I'm there.
---
Abbies bunker quests reward the traps, except for the radiation one.
---
If the wood has already been fashioned in to armor before the wood elf found it, I'm pretty sure wearing it wouldn't be a violation of the Green Pact.... It's legal to eat fruit that's naturally fallen from a tree, for example, so I'd imagine that so long as the Bosmer in question harmed no living plant life, he'd be fine.
---
&gt;The Green Lady says, “Though the Green Pact appears simple on the surface, its doctrinal details can be baffling to outsiders, and indeed, even the wisest of our Spinners disagree on some of its aspects. The first tenet you mention would be better stated as “Harm no living plants,” and this we strive not to do, even when we sing the house-songs to the trees so they will form lodgings for us. But does it harm a living plant to eat its fallen fruit? Indeed not—in fact, in this way the plant’s seeds are spread.

---
Good lord, that's a year away. Hopefully the game survives until then. Private servers and mod support would play a large part in pulling back the fanbase alongside bug fixes. 
---
They didn't just nerf it, they obliterated it.
---
Thanks for the work on this. Interesting stuff!
---
And you need to use a thing called tactics. You must suck ass to be killed by anyone using a "shitty pistol" and also are completely ignorant if you are scared of explosive anything after the fireproof change.
---
Unfortunately, any tradeable item that is really useful will be targeted by dupers
---
The guy asked what the setup was for an op melee build. I answered him. You have a problem with that?
---
Nicely done, I bet she laughed her ass off!
---
R.I.P. her ass :(
---
I love fallout. I've played since 3... They've all had issues and I've looked past them because the overall game was great.....
---
I've put 100s of hours into 76 and will likely continue to even with how much they continue to ruin the fun.. Honestly at this point I'm just eating time until Anthem is released...I really hope this game bounces back.. But there are just so many issues more important than the TSE weapons. Countless bugs.. Server issues. Perk card issues. Like if you have under armor on when you get in PA your resistances are dropped dramatically. Or strange in numbers actually suppressing all positive mutation effects when not in a team. Spawning into a nuke zone and dying before you've even loaded.. Legendary spawn rates.. Monster spawn rates.. stash and building limits.. There are bigger priority than nerfing one of the few good things about the game..
---
Anthem.. Don't let me down!
---
Bro are you mad or what 
---
Contrary to the stink that gets raised here every once in a while, a vast majority of the players you'll come across are pretty passive, friendly people.
---
Unless you're getting attacked in every single server(which really isn't ever happening), it's a safe bet to assume those hostile players are far and few in between in comparison.
---
In short, don't miss out by avoiding others! There's more fun to be had meeting up with others than there is danger.
---
I had one of each robot model for a long time hoping it would happen but it got tedious picking them out of my inventory, dropping them in a bag, crafting/repairing, then putting them back so it didn’t try to use them for their aluminum. I did it with the non-playable instruments like the accordion too. Oh well, something to later on if they do implement it. 
---
Depends on the legendary rolls you get. The base damage of a sledge hammer is less than a super sledge hammer. Not sure how much the attack speed differs but SS and Grognaks axe are considered amongst the best due to having highest damage per hit. The way the game works with damage reduction (also known as DR) you want as BIG a punch as possible to get through the armor. This is why fast firing weapons do bad damage even though they have "high DPS".
---
Ah, so that's why I don't remember getting the plans.
---
Q: Which events do you feel are most rewarding to you?   
---
A: I think the One Violent Night event has good atmosphere. I would like to see more events that do this.   
---
Q: Which events do you not care about doing or dislike? Why?   
---
A: I have little interest in escort missions like 'The Messenger'. I like the joke at the end, but dislike everything else. There's little substance to it and because you're just walking next to a robot, it feels like it takes forever.
---
Q: Which events do you prefer to play in a team vs. solo? Why?
---
A: The ones that requires you to visit multiple locations like the Horde-events. Mostly because when the places are far away from each other it costs a lot of caps to travel between each place.
---
Q: What types of events would you like to see in the game?   
---
A: 1. Events that affect the players and/or world. Restore Feed the People, maybe change it to where people can pick up their food at Mama Dolce's, if you don't want the food to magically appear in people's inventory. Maybe change the Verdant Season-mechanic to something you can create by doing an event. I'm sure there are other things here.
---
2. Maybe something like The Silver Shroud-quest in Fallout 4? Maybe tie an event to the Order of Mysteries?
---
3. Maybe add an event that rewards you if you do it stealthy. Like an infiltration get in, place the charges, get out. Make it possible to do by brute forcing it, but make sure that the stealthy way is shorter/easier/more rewarding.
---
Q: How do you join events? Do you fast travel? Do you go to a location expecting to start an event?
---
A: At this point I have a bit of a daily routine, mostly about hitting the vendors in an as cost-effective manner as possible. If an event is on that route, I usually check it out, depending on how much time I have that day. I also look on the map for A. Events that might get me a plan I want (a mechanic I don't agree with, since it essentially makes me do an event that I don't necessarily enjoy doing). Or, if there's a defend mission in my vicinity, I hop by to lend a hand and drop of any duplicate plans.
---
Q: How would you feel about bonuses for completing a daily or weekly event?
---
A: I'm not sure what I should expect from 'bonuses'.   
---
If I'm honest I think priority should be given to creating more and better story-quests over making more events. The game desperately needs characters, places and events people can connect with. I have vivid memories of The Replicated Man, Oasis, Come Fly With Me and Heartache By The Number. Another thing those quests have in common is that each gives you a choice and that choice has an impact. And for the love of Atom, the quest can NOT be just a series of 10 holotapes or notes or terminal entries. Rose is an example of an OK character and I guess MODUS is kind of intriguing. But if I'm honest, it needs something better. Like Burke, Harkness, Cass, Harold, Fawkes, Benny and I fucking loved Nick Valentine and especially Curie. Meanwhile I was more engaged with ED-E than the Overseer of Vault 76. Anyhow, I'm droning on... I sincerely hope this was helpful. :)
---
And yet you still don't realize it's giving you 280 and not 360.
---
Nobody cares about pvp... go away.
---
I didn’t know the PS4 had blue screens until this game.  I send the error report every time.  I used to play mostly on a PC up until fallout 4.    I feel back at home with the blue screens here.
---
Go to your stash and “store all junk” then try it again. 
---
Okay. I’m gonna keep farming then. If you happen upon a spare of them, I’ll be more than willing to take them off your hands if you want. Just let me know!
---
the main vendor in Grafton often has them, the Grafton station vendor can have them as well though they're rarer
---
The Green Pact would only be broken if they made they harvested the wood themselves. Many Bosmer outside of Valenwood still uphold the Pact, but are fine using wooden weapons and tools and living in homes made of wood, so long as the wood was originally cut by someone else. Since most of the trees you can harvest wood from in F76 are already dead, one could argue there is no harm done there as well.
---
You know what, you converted me. It's not going to stop me from fast traveling to the defense events, but I'll definitely think twice if it's like a level 5 character that's trying to take a workshop and then my level 47 s popping in ruins it for them. Unless it's in the forest, because that region has a little cap that might make it more manageable for them
---
I have had this happen to me se real times. The camp
---
Stove specifically 3 times. The good news is the plans drop frequently for taking gorge junkyard. The disturbing part of this is I have lost prime plans, power armor plans, heavy armor plans, and others. I contacted Bethesda, no dice on this one. 
---
Hi, Jess. Thanks for being around to hear our thoughts, and I do hope you'll consider letting the team know that the upcoming nerfs to the Two Shot prefix are not necessarily being well received by a number of players in this thread, especially for those that do not engage in PVP. The two shot prefix alone was never considered overpowered by most players, it was the combination of two shot and explosive. There been have a number of thoughtful suggestions following your post (such as nerfing only the explosive effect, or both effects only when applied to the same weapon); I hope you'll pass some of them along!
---
Bethesda killed his puppy!
---
I do, they will cry and want it nerfed next.
---
Or they could just be people that want top DPS in and out of PvP for the sake of being the best you can be. I farmed and got one so I don't see the big deal about people not being able to get one, also you can be completely immune to them with a little knowhow, modding armor, and perk investment. Most people, instead of looking for a counter and strategizing better, would rather cry op for their own lack of skill/problemsolving.
---
Nice! I'd love to see a list of under armour clothes. Outfits are nice, but been able to see your armour is nice as well
---
_READ THE POST._
---
People are grinding for tse weapons but they are getting nerfed so grinding is low. Duping is gone. Many bugs have been fixed. New pvp servers coming 1st quarter this year
---
Uh yeah, PS4 here and despite a few hiccups every now and again I've been getting, for the most part, several hours of consistent play on the same servers 
---
Well, as soon as my friendlist gets synced, I'll be happy to buy on on these. Thanks for headups )
---
Your toys are next so don't get too excited there.
---
What I have been experiencing suddenly (like 4 times in the last 10 minutes) is while I'm playing the loading screen will suddenly appear, then it will say "Account Session could not be found." and then finally "Disconnected from Server."
---
I tend to get it only when running off road, which means it's likely tied to bushes.
---
Don’t be a cunt. There is absolutely no excuse for this game to be in this condition. Even if you’re dick riding F76, there is no excuse for a full priced “AAA” title like this to be THAT UNPLAYABLE.
---
Guessing they forgot
---
And I wish I could down it's you 1001 times.
---
The problem is that, with the reload speed, The Dragon is never going to be great for chaining crits. It's a solid gun, though.
---
I’m only in the low 60s, so I would definitely try rebuilding to get rid of old building pieces and rebuild them in the cheaper form. Might be worth a shot!
---
PSA: you can ‘de-level a perk card. 
---
If you have a max perk card at 3 stars, then just upgrade it one more time. It will give you a new fresh 1 star perk card while keeping the 3 star perk card. 
---
How about...they fix the real problem. Nerfing the weapons in a game chock-full of bullet sponges only makes PvE worse than it already is, which is especially problematic considering the vast majority of players prefer PvE to PvP. The problem with the weapons *is how they are being used against PvE players by PvP players* and not the weapons themselves.
---
The problem that needs to be fixed is the mixing of PvE and PvP. It was a dumb idea to begin with and has become so much worse that one has to wonder why Bethesda refuses to address the obvious issue. Usually, this indicates there is a pigheaded fool somewhere in the decision making process at Bethesda who simply will not acknowledge the real source of the problem, probably because they were the person or persons who made the decision in the first place and don't want to admit it was a bad one. Identify this person or persons and either fire them or reassign them to janitorial services and then implement separate servers for PvE and PvP and leave the weapons alone unless you're going to take out the sponginess of the targets.
---
Same, I’ve haven’t seen one until this game. 
---
It has a bigger bulge
---
I mainly use my 2 shot Gatling gun but it looks like me explosive shotgun will have to be my go to weapon. 
---
It's op but not "take away 75% of its damage" op
---
Not mad at All, just saw a few posts with people asking this question. Ill play again and honestly enjoy the game, hence the re-install. 
---
Lol yeah she said it made her day. Her ass is alive and well, I'm happy to report. 
---
It's true melee should NOT do three to ten times the damage of my Gauss rifle.
---
Isn’t there a perk under perception that allows rifles to ignore armor and stagger? I think it’s called Tank Buster? That would solve some of the issues you just raised for rifle builds.
---
 Yes my two shot missile launcher is getting vendored now because it’s not worth keeping around solely to bring to queen fights. Just looted it yesterday and modded it with targeting thinking it would be great for tagging her in the air...
---
I used a TSE Guass Rifle on a wall 2 feet in front of me with a 15 PER full rifle build at night with sandman at night... didn't take a quarter of my health and I only have 3 END (for Rank3 Fireproof).
---
Not sure why my result is so diff from yours.  BoS Heavy Combat with Dense torso.
---
Dragon is pretty bad in vats to be honest
---
As someone that loves this game and wants to see it get better. I’m sorry you went through that bullshit, especially since it’s a full price game. I know the dick riding fanboys on this sub get hurt when F76 gets criticized but there is absolutely no excuse for that kind of experience when you’re paying that kind of money.
---
I hope you can come back to the game later and find it in a much better state.
---
So buff everything else, not nerf. You are disagreeing with yourself here.
---
Agreed
---
Asstounding!
---
Never used a node. Don't find them very useful. 
---
If melee is fine, TSE needs a buff not a nerf. Are you fucking dense?!?
---
Just to make people aware, I have had four more separate people message me today and say they have been banned, these four people do not interact with each other and they all messaged me randomly to let me know, Bethesda is mass banning accounts, they seem to have gotten a lot of people but they missed a lot too so I don't know what the criteria is for being banned.
---
The internet therapists always make me laugh. Have fun getting demolished. And if they didnt keep seeking revenge and shooting me I wouldn't continuously kill them.
---
What if they refunded the original cost once you complete the event?
---
You pay full price to get there, but get your money back for contributing to the event.
---
Nope, really sucks rebuilding 97 corn too.
---
also since XP buffs don't overwrite other consumables couldn't you have both the tea and cranberry juice (cobbler overwrites relish, but juice does not)
---
Uhh fireproof now counters anything explosive.
---
I agree with you, but I think the solution is not to prop up weak weapons with powerful effects, but ask for those weapons to be separately buffed. LMG is so sad, I love the looks of it and it would be nice if it dealt more damage. Also it’s kinda unnecessary next to the .50, so I’d kinda prefer if they upped the damage of both, and reduced recoil on the LMG and increased it on the .50. Accurate and stable for long range suppression or close range d-d-damage?! Pick.
---
Also I think ammo consumption is a valid balancing factor in this game because of the resource grind. Let them hit harder some more due to the amount of resources it costs to make their ammo. Same consideration to gat laser and gat plasma.
---
Once you learn the bos mods. You can buy them from the grafton vendor. There are 3 different plans for it. Arms, legs and chest.
---
 I'm in the game but it is running insanely slow. I also can't use workbenches as the menu never opens and o can't exit and have to kill the game.
---
No, but I'll go check it out 
---
Yeah, we can agree that with fireproof countering it, explosive did NOT need a nerf?
---
Did you also not know about passive mode?
---
True. I'll leave this up and will see about submitting feedback officially 
---
Melee needs a nerf, you're an idiot if you think otherwise.
---
Happened to me, bunch of sad bastards with nothing else to do, one tried it again but I ignored him. A fissure site had been nuked so I fast traveled to fight the scorch queen and they started stealing my workshop thinking I would go back.
---
Then the game crashed again during the fight, third time I've been at the last main quests and it's crashed. Kind of given up a bit now between the bellend other players and the game crashing all the time. 
---
Welcome everyone to the future little brother of Fortnite.
---
Any melee doing that is running a Bloody affix weapon and rolling with no more than 45-55 HP. It is a literal glass cannon build. 
---
Also, know what melee’s weakness is? Range. If you let someone who is obviously rolling a sledgehammer get that close to you, you probably deserve to lose that encounter. Just run Blocker if you’re having problems keeping melee users away and keep separation.
---
what I don't understand is ranged is being nerfed when melee can 10 shot the SBQ...
---
Why do the phones not have plastic?
---
That’s why I only included one of each. It’s divided into 5 sections: food, drink, chem, liquor, rad-x
---
You know, so far, I have seen exactly one of those in 122 levels. Wonder why I don't see them.
---
I did know about passive mode only learnt today that it makes it so you can't damage other players structures 
---
I'm glad my game is fully playable. Haven't had any major issues in weeks. But once again, thank you for taking time to let us know how upset you are. We had all been really curious how you were doing
---
charisma gives better rewards.
---
I got a magic find/money find character just for that
---
People talk about it like it’s the anti christ. In reality it’s just a game that launched with a rough start, but what games as a service game doesn’t? There’s always bugs galore and a lack of content. People keep judging the game based on what they wanted rather than it’s own merits
---
Uh oh. *They're on to me boiz.*
---
Aw haha 
---
Sneaking in PA is not very effective.  I do all my sneaking/snipe in regular armor.  I suit up for tough events and nuke zones.
---
Fucking agreed 100%
---
It's a garbage post, I wasted enough time reading it the first time. 
---
Its a mess for me.
---
Stuck at loading screen right now. 
---
I've probably had a dozen or more blue screens. Ce-34878-0. 
---
Uninstalled. Redbuilt database. Reinstalled. Reinitialized my entire PS4 and I still crash every 10 mins or so. 
---
No word from Bethesda on this issue. They would rather comment on peoples pretty camps or the TSE nerf.
---
This problem makes the game actually unplayable for PS4 players if you are having them, and no real clue as to what is actually causing it.
---
I have no problems with any other games I play. I didn't even know that you could BSOD on PS4 until FO76.
---
Same, I got excited seeing so much duct tape in the store last weekend. 
---
It really is fant-ass-tic.
---
True, I have been able to one shot the vast majority of mobs if I am undetected, but I have had a problem being detected or mobbed since hitting 50 and venturing into nuke zones (yes I waited until 50 to check them out). I normally use my trusty lvl 25 instigating lever action, and carry a drum handmade(single fire) for once I am detected.
---
Tbh I do have a problem with hoarding to an extent, I waited until 45 to make excavator armor and got super lucky and found 2x calibrated shocks and that is what has kept me from giving up on power armor is that sweet 200 extra carry weight.
---
Oh I will for Sure play again! Thats not even a worry, I just know Im not alone so thought Id share
---
Ok just making sure 
---
Better yet: release them all at once and immediately put them on discount.
---
1̶0̶0̶ 80$!!
---
What about a mode for people who don't want any pvp.  I am sick of getting instakilled by jerks when I am just minding my own business. It really ruins the game for me.
---
OP, did you ever find it?
---
I'm sorry make that 7 now! I'm giving up and playing god of war instead
---
Yesss! I saw the most perfect log to get wood the other day on the side of the road!
---
Yeah I know. And Melee's had it's own equivalent of that perk since launch and notice how no one has complained about it?
---
This right here ⬆️  I know it works had to do it for my lever action lvl 45
---
Boiled water? Purified! I don’t want that nasty river water in my Nuka!
---
It's still pretty messy.  There's fun in it, but if really messy turns you off it's worth avoiding for awhile.
---
Ok so still no proof of Heavy Weapons being good? Got it.
---
Same for my BoS onzie upgrade. 
---
I swear this game is pretty much randomized. I and others have a great time with little to no issues others like one of my friends and you have a terrible run. Hope your next run is smoother n better. Please try again in February.
---
So you seriously believe that if PvP and PvE were separate then explosive weapons would be fine as they are now with no need for any nerfs?
---
No... because the biggest problem with stuff like explosive weapons and especially TSE weapons is that they obsolete any other weapons due to their insane damage potential and require Bethesda to create bullet sponges like the Queen just to have some difficulty in the game.
---
If you want fewer damage sponges then the solution there is to make enemies less of a damage sponge in the first place, not to allow for insane weapons that trivialize them while everyone else that hasn't gotten lucky or bought a duped weapon is still chipping away at them bit by bit.  
---
I would continue, but I fear this is getting a little ass-inine.
---
Doesn't each faction have a separate cap pool?
---
She got a good laugh. Mainly because it's true.
---
It would be nice if it wasn't immensely boring after about a hour of play due to never being able to find half the crap one needs to keep things repaired or loaded like really I'm lv38 and the only thing keeping me.from playing is knowing I have to spend hours hunting down anything with incredibly low odds of finding any (plastic/ballistic material) not to mention everytime I turn around hey look lv100+ one shotting me and I doubt that dmg Nerf is gonna fix that issue pacifist.mode player should take ZERO DMG if not actively engaging someone else
---
Yeah I never want to use the phrase “unplayable” because it’s usually used sarcastically, but it really has been lately. 
---
#BETHESDA POISONED HIS WATER SUPPLY, BURNED HIS CROPS AND DELIVERED A PLAGUE ONTO HIS SETTLEMENTS!
---
You seriously are a cunt.
---
Just because your game works fine doesn’t mean that players who are having trouble shouldn’t voice their problems.
---
BGS WANTS posts like this on this subreddit you goddamn backwards twat. They literally make posts asking people to do this. How the fuck else is the game going to get better? By pretending this shit show is okay? Fuck outta here with that fan boy bullshit.
---
Here's the link if you need it:  https://bethesda.net/community/topic/314209/feedback-requested-events?language%5B%5D=en
---
Take all Pipe-Weapons out of the pool.
---
Fallout 4 had the same issue. I don’t want high level enemies using Pipe-Pistols, I want them using my scrap Service Rifle I installed lol.
---
It's been around for a while, but they have said today that it will be fixed with the next patch
---
Good. Sounds like an issue that hopefully Bethesda will respond to.
---
The LMG is definitely balanced by its enormous resource cost to feed, same as the gatling laser. Fusion Cores aren’t exactly easy to make compared to normal ammo.  Both are useless against the 50, especially when comparing resource costs to feed. The 50 ammo is made in batches of 180 (with Ammosmith) but UC 308 is made in batches of 86, significantly less for regular 308. 
---
Plasma cores however are not difficult to make and the plasma gatling does decent, but not stellar, damage. The balance for it is that it’s so pathetically fragile.  You only get a couple of cores before it breaks. 
---
I know, right? I saw some super glue the other day and was just thrilled until I realized I couldn't take it in-game.
---
Ya, they are only useful if using auto stim or born survivor (these effects trigger supers first)
---
They are looking to fix it in the next big patch at the end of the month. It has been a plague on us all since launch. It will pull from scraps first, then mods, then bulk, so always keep some stuff unbulked to spare your mods.
---
Butt, butt...
---
Time to find a new way to play the game, TSE dupers.
---
&gt;"he shouldn't be more powerful than me, because he earned it crowd."
---
Going to gameflip and searching "fallout 76 tse" and buying a dupe doesn't count as earning it, not in the slighest.
---
&gt;it looks like we'll all be reduced to having to use melee
---
My build without a single ranged legendary weapon oneshots everything in the game except elites like schorchbeasts who generally take 2-3 shots to kill with the dragon, maybe it's time to start learning how the game actually works instead of just running around in power armor and a duped TSE mowing down everything without an actual build you put thought into.
---
Looks like some good stuff overall. I am really happy the full pvp stuff is separate, that did not sound fun at all lol. Ignore the haters, this game has a lot of potential still!
---
My melee weapon does over 200 damage i don't need turrets anymore
---
Let me introduce you to Golf Shirt/Golf Skirt, 25caps with bargain perk and they weight 0.1.
---
I was trying to find one today but all of them were attached. Then I thought mutfruit but nothing really fit the bill.
---
I insist, we need to put this ~behind~ us
---
Most communication doesn't address exploits, so I have to imagine that they are planning on dealing with it *somehow* but aren't wanting to advertise the issue.
---
I have been making a set of T45 for a buddy so that is in my stash along with the free enclave set that I've never set down so it weighs zero still. I run around in T60 and sold the ugly yellow suit. 
---
Is that each explosion deals 100% of the total explosive damage? Pretty comedic if true.
---
Yeah but I don't get piles of those just playing the game. Scorched and mole miners both drop plentiful shotguns. 
---
&gt; ...in the first place.
---
Sure, but we're talking about fixing a game that is already in play, not making it anew from scratch. The weapons and the targets have already been built against each other and it works; granted, not the way either you or I would prefer, but it is what it is. PvP players using these same weapons again other players is what all the bitching has been about concerning these weapons; in other words, it is *how* the weapons are being used, not that they exist in the first place.
---
Don’t necessarily need to buy the plans,  you just need the pieces and you can do it
---
Main vendor? I've only ever come across the station vendor. Where's the main one?
---
Good call with that. Thanks for the info!
---
I'm melee, so I know what the weakness is. And PvP is ridiculous in this game anyway one way or another. People think TSE is the issue. Just wait until they start getting one shotted with no bright flashy lights to blame TSEs and dupers on. Then they start complaining about the next thing. And I do run Blocker, and every defensive and armor perk. And I also have a full set of Assassin armor.
---
 Yeah I was confused too. I had bought and learned it but it never showed up. So I bought a bit and there it was. ;)
---
I’ve never seen that. What a mess this is. I don’t understand. 
---
Varies day to day, somedays I login and get the normal load screen, then it says “camp cant be placed” the  another load screen. I usually gotta close app and try again. Somedays runs perfect for 6-8 hours no bugz
---
Hopefully! Thanks for the input!
---
I certainly hope so
---
Did the original toy in the fallout world actually shoot flames? I mean I’d totally believe it in this crazy world but just never heard it before 
---
Specifically "its a year out"
---
They didn't say november 2019
---
Ok, you win. I can’t argue with that fashion.
---
I guess there is a time to put an ~end~ to things.
---
I'm 111
---
Nearly 200 hours
---
Got it on launch date
---
Never over encumbered, always scrap my loot
---
I keep close to my limit but seldom go over (I like to be able to move at a reasonable pace)
---
My armour is all at least 1 star (5pieces) and all my weapons are 1 star some 2 star with a couple of 3 star (no trading, just what I've found so far) 10 weapons total including stash
---
No tesla rifles here
---
Voicing your problem and crying like a bitch are 2 different things. 
---
More book keeping for the game, but that could work.  Easier to just up the caps reward for most the out-of-the-way events.
---
Break it all down and you'll be a junk god!! Ill take some off your hands too if on XB1
---
Double checking the problem: You placed power conduits (the pipe looking things) and then hung the lights directly from the pipe, correct?
---
Power conduits (the pipes) do not radiate last I saw. This means you can run them across the map, and nowhere on the pipe will lights actually turn on. There are two possible ways to get around this that I know of. You can either place and connect regular power connectors to the pipes (I had a hanging light fixture where the power cords to run the lights looked like support wires). Alternatively, you can place a connector between pipe sections and place an emitter (the little round bit that does not have the wire connection point) but I have not tested this method because frankly I didn't think of it.
---
I’d pay a couple thousand atoms for a turret that actually shoots half as well as the random npc ones for how much damn budget it takes up 
---
yeah? they are fixing things, but there's still a ton of exploits and dupes.
---
I have a constant flow of them from running Whisperings. There's 9 per server and you can hop. I keep them in my stash when I've sold everything else I don't need.
---
I totally feel that, almost wish there were additional Jeans pieces, but that's just be another piece of clothing to collect lol
---
Nah.
---
The “camp can’t be placed” message is only because another player has built their camp in the same spot as yours on that server. 
---
Gutbuster Brigade!
---
9 of them 😁 a ton of trading and talking to players lol
---
Yeah Bethesda, ignore a large portion of the community because this muppet says so. 
---
When did anyone complain about TS in itself? No one. 
---
OP probably couldn’t find anything better than a ghouls gamma gun that’s why he’s happy about the changes.
---
You must be doing something special then... I have a level 112 and after tonight a level 97... ammo is always an issue... logged into a friends server to start the night off... some randos are in silo Charlie and drop it on prime.... score... cause I didn’t have to do any work.
---
After 30 min of batting and at least 15 players including a level 233 the queen flys off undefeated.... chalk it up to a damage glitch and we head to site bravo
---
Drop it on prime site again... this time 10 -13 players tops.... She dead with 20.38 on the clock.... de-spawns before I can get the loot but turns into a meat pile... get the loot after about 10 min worth of waiting... score now let’s do it again... head to site alpha
---
Drop it on prime again... even less players... maybe 9 or 10... same thing as the first... queen flys off into the distance  
---
2 out of 3 times we don’t defeat her or get any loot... we got her down both times... she regenerated her health... but still flew off  into the distance with about half health... so either there’s a random damage glitch with her that occurs 66.6 percent of the time ore more... or we just weren’t doing enough damage... either way needing the damage on the top guns in the game is not going to help the situation... as I said earlier the only thing this nerf will help is PvP which the vast majority of the player base has no interest in... therefor this nerf ruins the game.... for me at least... I will most likely stop playing after the next “fix” or “patch”
---
It’s a shame...
---
Uhhhh you're late too the party.
---
They've been talking about the pvp mode since before xmas
---
I get that, but game hadnt even loaded and I’m immediately met with another full load screen
---
I bought it from someone, but there used to be a glitch to obtain it. Not sure how it worked or if it's still available or not 
---
Every time I hear about 3d printed guns I think of that movie. John Malkovich had always kind of creeped me out so he was the perfect bad guy there. 
---
Have you listened to the overseer's tape that said something about needing a part for rose's radio? Go get the part and rose will let you up to the top floor.
---
I see what you're saying, but let's say I have one that does 62 damage.  The Sword.  I pick up something else that does 100, and I say, well, time to lose the sword.
---
I can still see the craft, but now it's grey.  Any other weapon I don't even look to craft until I reach the next tier of 35/40.  Why, outside of the crafting menu specific to the weapon, would I assume this weapon is different from ALL OTHERS until I go to craft it?
---
Why not have a note, in the description, saying "Can be upgraded but not crafted from scratch?"
---
Good thing you're not in charge of the game.
---
Let them do their fixes, let them roll out the content they wanna roll out.
---
If you don't like it ..well I'm sure you know the standard response.
---
Pvp is already a joke with players in duped sentinel gear having 100% dmg reduction so I think that train has long since left the station. The changes are obviously for PvE because TSE is way out of line with any other legendary modification.
---
Awestome
---
Just because your game runs like ass doesn’t mean everyone else’s does. 
---
See what I did there?
---
Get over yourself. 
---
Philthys or Gnats?
---
Started playing 3 weeks and I gotta say it seems like FO76 has an amazing community. Everyone I meet in the world waves at me and often invites me home to their B.A.S.E. When I was a low level i was helped by a lot of higher leveled people who gave me all their spare junk, meds and duplicate plans. 
---
Now that I am level 60 and nearing the end game, the most fun I'm having is running around meeting other people who are struggling with quests, or occasionally drop off my own spare plans, recipes and purified water to some grateful low level. It just feels amazing helping people in this game. Just
---
yesterday I helped two level twenty-somethings get through the Wendigo Cave and we had a blast! 
---
Agreed, I'll take a **seat** now but thanks for the multiple laughs.
---
Junk and lead 
---
I might create another post with the under armor pieces, I'd have to go through and see if I've got em all first though
---
Isn't this purely a cosmetic costume that provides no breathing protection?
---
Cazadores
---
...with Stealth
---
Personally, I am happy to even have the ability to respec. They did not have to add this to the game. I can see issues with a total respec. What I would rather have is the ability have more then one load out, so I don’t have to keep swapping cards all the time while I am trying to craft. That is WAY more important to me then the ability to totally respec. Not to mention I find that sort of stuff kinda cheaty. 
---
I can sell you some on xb1
---
I use to have them all the time. Then I did a really deep cleaning for dust on my PS4 and reinstalled the game. I have only had maybe 2 or 3 since and that was about a week after launch, the cleaning was. Don't neglect the effect heat can cause. Plus, it can't hurt. 
---
Thanks. 
---
I love how the wood blocks have lead in them. Definitely not safe for children
---
Bett
---
the plans? well im on now danger noodle92
---
Honestly just a standard gear drop would be cool.  Imagine having your PvP start out with a leather armor set and a golf club and Combat rifle, then it scales up based on your “pvp level”, and you are placed with people your level.
---
maybe an option to repeat any content? The whole idea of resetting in full is pretty cool, I think it could be a function that appears with the pip boy where you already kind of can see everything you have completed.
---
I’d prefer it if they balanced the Gatling plasma a different way than the fragile thing it is now. Even increasing the cost of crafting plasma cores would be nicer than it breaking in 2-4 cores.
---
Explosive weapons are either not brokenly op, or blow your dick off op. Really no in between. 
---
I find this dubious as I’ve tried doing this with teammates (ie one uses their card and the other puts in the code/targets) and it wouldn’t allow anyone other than the keycard owner to put in the code or target for launch. 
---
We were already on the top floor and were able to talk directly to rose but the whole thing broke during the part of her quest line (I cannot remember the exact quest name) that requires you to gather all the raider key fragments. But despite doing this, my friend still can’t access the room with the red laser grid and the only quest he can access is the missing link which as said before, says ‘gain roses trust’. Man this sucks thank you for your help tho 
---
Wow. 
---
Did you transfer your game files to another disk? 
---
Ya, they would really need to add more stringent event contribution checks as well. 
---
Last night I completed the fertile soil event while just running around in ash heap, no where near that event.
---
Not that we should discount the idea due to a bug, since they have proven (at least to me) that they are earnestly trying to fix bugs.
---
I tend to see a lot of ultra lights in the southern stations, either Watoga or Lewisburg but can't remember which.
---
Yeah Jess the Flamer is really messed up man. They need to not only look at the base damage, but the durability issue, ammo consumption and making fuel ammo ( i believe someone forgot a zero or two here).
---
I don’t even think my first run (solo, lvl~50) was that long. All my crap was broken by the end, but it wasn’t 2 hours. 
---
In going to take some but throw the rest away so hopefully i wont get banned
---
How do you think children lit their cigars?
---
Is it really noticable? 
---
If it was a level 2 character, they're probably just figuring out controls and how to play. Could be trying to put armor they can't wear yet on the frame to store it with the 10 carryweight.
---
All the time, plus the black screen fast travel that makes you close game and reopen as server hopping doesn’t fix it. 
---
You can make ultracite fusion cores i made some im on Xbox 1 X i can help you out
---
I have never used Luck before, this tie I did.  I love ricochet and the Luck of the Draw.  Now I'm using One Gun Army and loving that.
---
Same here. 
---
The only "cure" seems to either sprint away from the problem area. Zone into the bunker or join a game one of my friends is playing in hopes of being transported away from whitesprings/ski resort/watoga.
---
That makes no goddamn sense, you deplorable dumb fuck.
---
Placing restrictions on server bases is a bad idea. Wanna never find a server? That's what will happen 
---
Server hopping is boring af. 
---
The RNG with legendaries is indeed terrible; no one will disagree with you there.
---
I think the point we are making is that you don't really *need* some overpowered 3* item to be successful in this game.
---
Started playing about a month ago and it seems like FO76 has an amazing community. Everyone I meet in the world waves at me, and often even invites me home to their B.A.S.E. When I was a low level i was helped by a lot of higher leveled people who gave me all their spare junk, meds and duplicate plans. 
---
Well it is unfair, whether anybody wants to admit it or not, that people using legitimately obtained TSE weapons and even people using only one of the affixes, are being punished. 
---
No, same disk they've been on since December.  checked and they're still there.
---
Baby steps yo. Megaton wasn't built in a day.
---
I do not get many blue screens, but when I do, its when I'm farming a nuke zone at whitesprings and accidentally blow myself up. 
---
Then when I try to respawn, I blue screen.
---
I regularly clear my cache, delete saved data, and rebuild my database. I definitely do not get the crash every session.
---
Lusty Assaultron Maid
---
Is that still possible?  I thought it had been fixed. I’ve seen it done before one of the patches. Tried to hit the same spot, can see outside the map briefly, but fall right back down into the entrance. 
---
Disclaimer:  wasn’t actually going to use the exploit if it worked. Only wanted to see how others were launching so quick. 
---
You realize pipe guns are some of the most powerful in the game, right?  Properly perked and modded, they are amazing.
---
Well you're intentions are good so I hope you stay safe dude
---
Ha, worse. 
---
Where in the station exactly ? Was it like in a container, or laying down somewhere ?
---
How are you simultaneously complaining about bullet sponges AND saying that the weapons and targets are properly matched against each other?  
---
The problem IS in how these weapons are being used but that problem is that they're being used as single target nukes because of their potential for ridiculous single target damage which causes problems in both PvP players one shoting people AND ends up requiring Bethesda to create bullet sponges that can survive the damage in the first place.  
---
If we follow Bethesda's solution of nerfing the aoe damage then yes, we've dropped their potential as PvP destroyers and will allow high level and boss enemies to live longer without needing to give them godlike health or defense... but it also kills their utility for general PvE play where these kinds of weapons should shine, being used against groups of enemies.
---
That's where my point comes in.  The focus of the nerfing shouldn't be in removing the damage from the explosion, but removing the single target damage.  That way someone using the weapons in PvP or against a Scorchbeat isn't doing twice the damage they should be doing but someone that wants to take out a cluster of ghouls at once can still whip out their explosive weapon and do so.
---
According to the tool-tip in the screenshot I posted up top, it has the breathing protections.
---
Good on you for noticing! Most people don't notice until it is too late.
---
If you're in a fight to the death and you're fighting fair, you've already fucked up.
---
Did not know such things existed. What does it do for you? Longer lasting? More damage in gatling Laser?
---
You're off the mark there......dipshit
---
You'd need to be more specific with your friend's status. What part were they up to before logging off? Does the quest show in the quest log at all? Completed? Unselected?
---
I've run into a few annoying speed bumps e.g. Super Mutant camp one but the whole quest line was completable.
---
Oh gotchya. Haven’t experienced that one. 
---
hmmm I think I saw the mapping and textures for cazadors from a mod in development..  
---
hmmmmmmmm  
---
My character is built for heavy weapons. I want to like some, but they’re useless without TS, and even with it, they’re nothing compared to a TSE. 
---
https://www.devildogfilmproductions.com
---
Right, okay. Which was the last key he collected?
---
Tbh I don’t think anything should be able to completely one shot someone aside from a nuke launcher, which ironically doesn’t really do much damage relatively speaking 
---
 LOL. Mine walk. I got 2 HMR plans and looked at 4 in the last few days.
---
 I do know the wei though. ;)
---
Yeah holy shit that’s 35 whole 24 hour days.
---
Yet here you are acting like a little bitch because someone’s game isn’t working the way it’s supposed to and you’re taking it upon yourself to be a cunt to people who want this games bugs fixed.
---
THATS COMMIE TALK!!!! 
---
The standard spacesuit helmet grants the same immunity as gas masks and scout armor mask.  The new Atom Shop one has them in the tool-tip, as well.
---
You’re gonna get more copies of them anyway, this really isn’t something we need. Just keep leveling, it’ll happen. 
---
Wouldn't it be surreal if it turned out China was completely untouched?  And it turned out the US/Enclave/Vault-Tec nuked the US themselves?
---
People are not using the word “negate” properly. Or “immune.”
---
Sounds like some damage still gets through, so your DR matters. I suspect you don’t have as much as they did.
---
Yeah it doesn't make a lot of sense that I can craft a fusion core but not wooden armor.
---
 Try again somewhere else. I have had that happen and later it worked at another place.
---
Faster reload is nothing to sneeze at with a hunting rifle...
---
It's nice that the recipes that drop unique to events don't seem to dupe with what you know 
---
Hemlock is twice as good. Pulled like 240 raw violet outta there.
---
Once you get maxed out gunfu, crit savvy, and better crit it's much easier to take out groups. Glow sight is essential for nuke zones.
---
I think the game is forginving enough you don't NEED any perk, but it's nice to have.  I banked a lot then just said F-it, gimme my Luck.  
---
I think the game is forgiving enough you don't NEED any perk, but it's nice to have.  I banked a lot then just said F-it, gimme my Luck.  
---
People have told me that there's an odd discrepancy between the crafting materials you have on you versus the ones in your Stash.  If your Power Armor Station and Stash are connected (such as at your CAMP, or at certain locations like Big R's in The Mire I think), try putting all your junk in the Stash and then craft/repair your Power Armor.
---
I see thousands of UL  marine and robot mod plans, but never combat
---
Ah, am on mobile, images not loading.
---
That’s it?  I’m a heavy build and easily go through 1k of UC 50, even with a Prime TSE 50. 
---
I took a nap in Taggerty's office and woke up to 15 ghouls...
---
It did. 
---
Yeah Rose's quest is a little wonky to figure out but if you have the 76 handbook it explains in detail how to solve and finish the entirety of the quest line. 
---
Caps seem reasonable. It's the non-monetised in-game currency 
---
&gt;zfirex
---
Yeah but you can't achieve the same results, the perk stacked with legendary effects don't reach what you can with melee, plus their base damage is lower, so in effect 2shot brought the damage up to match.
---
Hemlock Workshop has ~240 raw violet sitting around the general area just waiting to be collected.
---
Can anti-armor appear with explosive? If so, that might be better, especially for shotguns, as they don’t have a perk that reduces armor. Combat shotties do have mods that do this but the best mod of those is still lower armor reduction than the legendary effect.
---
This all depends on the armor of what you’re shooting at.
---
I want the games bugs fixed too, but I can send bug reports directly to Bethesda instead of crying online to everyone to make myself feel better 
---
And so it begins
---
And is stating real events without emotion now considered crying? Was I Crying?! WHATS GOING ON, THERES WATER IN MY VA-... EYES!
---
I wasn't aware that you could call for assistance like that. Nor have I ever seen a call for help. I respond here because I was at the same place yesterday, level 28, and had my ass handed to me by Muties 20+ levels over me. I've put that leg of the quest on hold for now til I gain level 30 or so and think about how to approach clearing this place out.
---
I want to be helpful to others in the game, I don't play with the Raider mentality. If I hear gunshots nearby and see yellow dots on the map, I usually head in that direction and see if I can help. Likewise with events. And I've been on the receiving end of unsolicited help as well in events, and it's appreciated. I try to at least give a thumbs up and am usually met with same. The little interaction I've had with other players has been 80% positive.
---
In the same boat as you my friend, in the process of an appeal now. Banned with zero evidence as none exists but I'm still waiting to hear back from them. Hopefully they do check my account and give it back rather then just leave me in limbo.  If I didn't figure out from reddit to check my spam folder I wouldn't have even found the ban notice, I thought I was hacked! 
---
Omg! Sounds like a super dupe! Ban em all
---
Something will always be best sure, but what matters is that it’s comparable, in say WoW for example aside from certain instance all the classes and specs do very similar to each other with the best being at most 10% more then the worst and it’s rare to even be that big a difference, as opposed to here where TSE were 500% better then the next highest option, with all relevant perks a weapon/build should not consistently outperform all others by such a large margin, it’s somewhat more ok with the bloodied builds as those are super glassy and have like 50 hp so it’s a tradeoff, though even then it should only be maybe 50% more damage or so then the rest and that’s still quite generous 
---
This reply makes my first post since 2014 totally worth it, Thanks :D (no, Im not joking, I LOVE this!)
---
The term is "crash". Crash is crash, it's not disconnect.
---
As a client you can easily tell that disconnect is caused by server crash, if all your friends were disconnected with you, so there goes that theory.
---
To be fair he is ignorant, not stupid. Most people are this way when it comes to the game mechanics. For instance bloodied explosive is leagues ahead of two shot explosive. And melee is just stupid. With certain armor you can be invincible, etc... There are alot of things that need nerfs. Or are there more things that need buffs? I'm not sure which one.
---
Ricochet works in PA, Lucky Break doesn't.
---
Luck of the Draw works constantly for me with all weapons.  Lvl 3.
---
Pipe revolvers need a look too. The bullets fly too far. Limit them to bash damage only if you care about the longevity of the game/the market/PvP balance.
---
&gt; because I had a lvl 5 build
---
Not really sure what you mean. Could you explain? 
---
Nope too worried about trying to balance guns instead of fixing damn game
---
I'll agree it's Beth's fault for releasing them into the game in that state in the first place.
---
It doesn't change the fact they sorely needed to be tuned down and that's what's happening.
---
I do sympathize with those that got the guns legitimately, but after seeing the same exact combat shotgun on several players in almost every server I've been to I just feel it's gotten way beyond the chance of all these people getting them legitimately. It sucks they might have paid caps for them, but a vast majority of these weapons shouldn't even exist in the first place. 
---
And it does suck for those using only a single one of these effects getting caught in the cross fire. I myself have been using a Troublemaker handmade with explosive rounds that I found for a good portion of the game. 
---
But it's necessary. They're not the only type of weapon out there.
---
Interesting, I hadn't noticed that 
---
There a guide with pictures of camp plans on fallout 76 facebook group
---
Ricochet is also good.  But beware if you're not Pacifist, as it's considered you attacking.
---
I actually didn’t know two shot reduced accuracy, the only two shot weapon I ever found is also my most accurate so I never noticed 
---
With cavalier assassin armor you can sprint straight at them and tank shots to the face lol
---
And I Did, but they are Not sharing said information and I enjoy my gaming community so did my small part. What have You done today?
---
I’ve been doing them heavily since beta and if I really think about it the rewards seem they are the equivalent of a single trash mob far too often. Easily less than half the time I am awarded a plan when completing an event and then it’s usually one I have already learned. Far worse I have yet to be awarded a single event apparel item which is actually why I farm events to begin with. I can’t go as far as to describe it as pointless, I feel that’s a dash of drama. I would say it’s feels like it’s not far off though. 
---
True but I think it still counts as armor so it blocks chameleon? But I’ll need to test that to be sure. If not then I’ll prob switch to that. 
---
Max HP doesn't matter if you take no damage from players lol
---
I was 20 on one and never found it...figured I would come earlier and maybe pass over some gear but if I need to be 15 then yeah probably can just walk.
---
Doesn't work with PA.  Ricochet does.
---
Lvl 5 rank of the perk but since you can’t de rank the perks and I needed to switch to level 4 I had to spend the next 4 levels getting the same card again 4 extra times
---
Ive been getting a crap load of Ce-34878-0 after this last patch while in Whitesprings. Im not sure if its connected, however after turning down my FOV slider to about half or less, I was experiencing them less. 
---
Always visit your stash and let it “load” before trying to craft. 
---
Meh. I just think the damage listed on your weapon should be what’s dealt to non player enemies. Bullet sponge enemies mean weapons need to deal crazy damage but players don’t have crazy high hp. Just changing the weapons so they deal normal damage to normal enemies and 10% damage to other players or something like that might work. And fixing the stacking issues for crazy damage as well. 
---
Based on the current priorities and things said since the launch of the game, I suspect they haven't looked into it due to the first reason you listed (more serious issues are the priority).  Especially given their concerns with stability based on stash and inventory etc.  I suspect this will be something they hope to give us once they resolve the more pressing concerns and are better aware of how various methods to allow this will impact things overall (since my guess is they would like to just let us put the actual items on display allowing for maximum customization and the potential for people to take those items etc, and if that won't work then figuring out alternative options like many of those given here).
---
 I just want to be able to name my power armor sets so I know what they are so I don’t have to pull out all 15 to find the one I want
---
Some do it for loot. You’d be surprised what wanted players carry on them, despite knowing anyone could come take them out at any given moment.  Took out a low level guy once and went to leave him some goodies (stims, ammo, etc) in his bag. He had been carrying over 400lb worth of junk with him!  
---
I track down bounties because it’s entertaining stalking a target. I could care less what’s in their bag (unless there’s some sweet sweet springs in there).
---
Reported bud
---
And I've been called hardcore at 500hrs with 1 character, holy shit man
---
You seriously are stupid! Oh my god! I can’t believe I’m wasting my time on you! Whatever, this will be the last reply.
---
Let me say it in a way your stupid ass will understand.
---
1) Bethesda Game Studios wants these posts in quantity. 
---
2) They’re active in this community and take these posts seriously. 
---
3) Just because they don’t comment and share every single one doesn’t mean it goes unseen or ignored. 
---
4) The Dev team VALUES these kinds of posts. 
---
5) Everyone at r/fallout is disappointed with players like you that adamantly defend the games problems rather than helping the community have an outreach.
---
6) This game is already struggling and it doesn’t need a little bitch like you brigading against posts that are critical to the betterment of this game.
---
The way you and your little butt buddies are acting is only going to drive players away from this game. And pretty soon, this game will fucking die if players like yourself continue to turn off people from ever wanting to play this game.
---
So many people are already refusing to buy this game because of how people like YOU act about it’s problems. Fallout 76 can’t afford to have cunts like you drive people away from the game.
---
When you first load into the game, your stash does not load until you open it once. You need to check the stash for the game to register all your loots first. 
---
It is not a bug. It is how the game deals with unnecessary loading. 
---
Virtually every other modern game does this and it's bizarre it wasn't done here. 
---
Multiple players in an event zone should be automatically grouped, and anyone who leaves the area is just dumped from the party. 
---
Played the game for around 2 hours. Took the newly fixed Power Plant to get tons of fully charged cores and explored the wasteland while farming challenges for Atoms
---
I havnt experienced this myself but it's unfortunate to say the least. This is insane and requires more upvotes. 
---
for? dont like it just ignore it snowflake
---
Thanks for the advice! I might need to redo my perk deck now though
---
Yup! Why ever pay for something with actual currency when you have in-game currency for a reason?
---
I heard about a hidden basement base with a lot of spikes and turrets. You can’t make turrets shoot at people unless they damage your base first anymore, but they’d still be there for when/if they do.
---
My personal favorite: cliffside base. I made the door open at an awkward angle and if you aren’t careful, you can slip off to your doom. Obviously doesn’t work on folks in PA. Also you can just edit the floor away from underneath them if they get uppity. Make the bad man fly!
---
Ullapool Caber
---
it's opposite the building protest march is in (right next to the truck trailer)
---
I said this before too. Why does the only armor in the game that prevents you from being one shotted need nerfed. Here's the balance. If they can't one shot you, then their armor is the thing that is broken and needs nerfed. Hehehe. They can't just keep nerfing stuff because that will just infuriate people. They need to give something back. They need to sweeten the deal. I'm hardly affected by this and it kinda annoys me. I can see where this is heading. Nerf everything into the ground.
---
There are lots of counters to TSE weapons, combined I take no damage from them, or anything for that matter. Do some research and use the tools you're given. Don't just assume because everyone uses them, they are the best. Bloodied is better than two shot on almost any weapon with the right build. And with the right build your 20% hp won't matter. So don't go there.
---
You’re looking at just the symptoms though. I’d make ammo found on bodies limited to one round per body, no one should find 19 .45 rounds on a body, ludicrous. 
---
Just press reinstall and choose the same directory as your existing files. It will do some magic and detect the file again. The launcher loses directory on updates all the time. 
---
That’s exactly what I’m getting. Alright I’ll try that 
---
Thanks for the enjoyable conversation.  Seeya in the wasteland!
---
Do you know where you found it?
---
Just south of the National Isolated Radio Array by the unmarked campgrounds
---
Probably a duper!
---
Because that can get players banned. And also that is not allowed on fo76. 
---
if you are having fun, it needs to be nerfed.  it just works.
---
I found one up on a cliff, figured it was another user's trying to bait me or some shit ... so I approached in sneak very carefully.  
---
Not owned, so I hopped into it and immediately a voice started up saying something along the lines of "Security Breach Detected."  
---
Then the gruff voice of a raider came on saying if you try to exit the suit it will blow up HAHAHAHAHA just kidding. 
---
Freaked me out for a second. 
---
then dont buy, obviously this post wasnt made for both of you
---
There should be a subreddit to expose dupers on.
---
What system are you on?
---
Demo expert dhould affect the explosive legendary, period.
---
You forgot sweet rolls.
---
NOCTURNAL BABY!!
---
If a radroach can have a combat shotgun up its ass then a few .45's is no big deal.
---
Annnddddd not fixed even now
---
Not true.  Sunshine Farm makes Salisbury steak, Sugar Bombs, Instamash, and Mac &amp; Cheese.
---
And a perfectly preserved pie
---
Nice! I tried and tried to fix that plant solo last year and had All the fun getting stomped pretending this was FO4, I learned fast but not quite fast enough to go back and loot board games
---
 theres also another area up in the NE similiar to it but not as fancy. I dont think its marked though. Just go north east for a bit from freddys horror shop. You should see some water and a crashed vertibird its around there.
---
Shit thought I added that. Ps4
---
Its high resk but high reward weapon why do u even want to nerf it??? U below 40%- health to make it work dont be stupid and telling them to nerf everything i play this game alot about 600+h and half my weapon i got them from farming  and what just nerf them and all my hard work is gone cos its strong this game is like this play it or shut up 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮not all off us are buying our weapon from market and without any effort like u 
---
That would be nice to have.
---
I don't mind plans.  
---
What I don't like is that server hopping tends to be the best/easiest way to get some of them. I think they should be dropped more frequently and maybe pull from a "NOT OWNED" type list instead of getting the same stupid Ivory Grip over and over.   
---
Also not a huge fan of the bizarre level caps they've put in place (ie Handmade plans). 
---
They could make it ESO with guns or along those lines where the boss mechanics are challenging and make you think and you can’t just be good by equipping the right armor.
---
Yes, give an inch, they take a mile sort of thing. I feel ALL damage needs buffed, as well as tougher creatures introduced. Ie, explosive resistant, huge health pools and resistances, more raid style boss type creatures. The reason everyone uses them is because you feel gimped without it compared to melee, the effect was too strong yes, but not so strong it needs a 75% decrease on both sides!
---
Please remove blips at least in the pvp mode. With blips and no pvp rules, it's just gonna be people tp'ing to eachother ganking and griefing. I have never liked player blips in online games. I want to be constantly looking over my should watching for people. Not just opening the map every 5 seconds to see if someone just tp'ed nearby
---
Still is overlooked
---
So drinking, drugs and watching Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy while playing FO76 is not a multitasking combination I’ve considered before, but I have noted it as potentially interesting now.
---
Ok, joking aside are you for real and this is some random encounter you saw? 
---
idc if its not allowed i already made over $1000 in 2 weeks. like i said if you dont like it just ignore it stupid snowflakes
---
I feel like if they were untouched, they would have attempted to enter the US at some point. There isn’t really any proof of China entering the US after the war. There’s also that submarine ship in Fo4 that had a ghoulified Chinese Officer that tells you about his PoV of the attack. 
---
I disagree.    
---
The choice to upgrade is permanent so you think about how you want to plan out your character. You don't have to upgrade. Eventually, you can have all perks at every level.
---
Yeah, of course they are. Which is why they brought two shot back down to earth. Time to adjust. 
---
Not for me, I can't play for more than an hour at a time (newborn baby to care for).
---
was marine not combat armor :(
---
What a load of marlarkey...
---
Proof. Bitch.
---
Ok but you can pick a different build. It’s not fair to the other players that you can kill things fast and they can’t. 
---
Go to your stash and “store all junk” then try it again.
---
I didn't mean it to seem dramatic. I meant pointless in the literal sense of the word. Hell, I'd even go as far as to say you actually *lose* money by doing many events, as travel costs are often 40+ caps.
---
But, the events are pointless as the rewards are so meager that you may as well kill a few random enemies nearby. You're just as likely to get a few chems, caps, and ammo off them anyway. 
---
Yea....Yea I could see that.  Even making it cost atoms isn't that bad.  A few days of challenges and you can re-spec.  Or just pay to speed it up.  That would be....lovely.   You can keep the move 1 perk point at a time also, gives another, slower, but free option to do it.  
---
I wouldn't call this a gameplay buff of any sort either, but it would allow people who really have unbalanced perks from poorly chosen leveling to ....reset.... things, without having to basically waste 10+ level ups to fix it.   Or allow people who found this bad@$$ legendary....that they aren't even ALMOST specced out to use....to somewhat more quickly swap over to a new layout.
---
I am a simple man, I see posts involving the commie whacker and I agree.
---
I have a marine armor dense and fireproof level 2. At 961 damage I take zero damage when against the wall shooting.
---
I believe it can. AA should be a primary affix while explosive is a secondary.
---
I lot a get of blue screens.
---
Oh, I should have said it differently lol. By fixed I meant the GMs fixed the Fusion Core generator to give 8 cores an hour lol. I didn't do the quest to fix the actual plant since I can just make Fusion Generators to power it
---
Agreed, not a big deal
---
Thanks for the tip. I'll have to try that.
---
Thanks 
---
The game is now ruined because of you cry babies. I've never duped, got my stuff legit, and now since they're balancing weapons, the game will be broke and crate way more lag issues by trying to balance weapons cause someone has hurt feelings. Prime example is destiny with the suros regime, they made an awesome second chance gun for pve, but pvp cry babies made the gun completely pointless. They made the heal perk activate 5 times less often, and the damage output was like using a basic common gun in game. 
---
Really it uses salves too? That’s very good to know 
---
It goes to the nerfing armor thing, I'm currently running sentinel assassin and I take no damage at all from other players if I'm standing still. Combine this with a bloodied explosive Gauss rifle and nobody can touch me. I've literally sat in the middle of watoga school parking lot and had 3 guys trying to kill me, all three had explosive weapons of some kind, and one for sure a shotgun. I just sat in one spot, rotating around popping vats to locate them and one shot them, if they shot at me, they just gave their position away. I made several thousand caps off of their sorry asses lol.
---
Imagine that, fans of a franchise with like 7 pve only games want a pve mode.
---
Who would of thunk it?
---
I’ve been to his base dozens of times tho and this is only the first time so it may just be a random encounter
---
The TS would still be a problem if they didn’t nerf it too because of how multiplications work. Currently a TSE gives a bonus of +300% damage, which is just too damn high so they nerfing it down to a more even +50% damage. To reach that +50% damage without nerfing two shot they would have to nerf explosive to negative -75% damage which would be stupid and absurd.  
---
Some are more lucrative than others.
---
The way I see it, the biggest motivation for doing Events would be rewarding the player with Plans they don't already have, regardless of what the Event is.  Once you've gleaned the basic rewards from an Event, there's little incentive to do it again.
---
Yeah I got a explosive western revolver and it’s not impressive. I’ve got a bunch of two shot guns, not impressive.  I have a level 20 two shot explosive pipe rifle and I can kill myself in one shot if my target is too close even if I’m wearing power armor
---
Now we're cooking. Along those lines, if we want to stop dupers we need to make it so rounds no longer stack, too.
---
I'm getting a hint of sarcasm here but I do think melee is stupid good. My rifleman character with no melee perks shouldn't be one shotting lvl 68 ghouls with a super sledge. That's whack, yo!
---
I think this is essentially like putting an easy mode in dark souls. The game is MEANT to be difficult,  you are meant to be threatened by other players and make the careful decisions where to show your face depending on if a high level in that session has proved to be dangerous, honestly just don't carry junk around and make the best of it. Small things like having to run away from a barrage of bullets to protect your precious stash and ambushing another player to get scraps you're having problems finding on your own are the best parts of this game and I think you are wasting the best experience you could have playing 76 by being so afraid of confrontation. I have yet to be unfairly targeted in a way that ruined my experience and I find having PVP be such a threat makes the friendships you make in game all the more precious. +karma for any fellow vault dweller though, look my up on xbox in you need a  gun to keep PVPERS off your back,  I'm a low level (20) but I can hold them off for you while you high tail it or we can take them down together for their loot

Play events and turn in technical data, you'll get tons of plans.
---
 I tried from about level 13 and nothing till level 15. I saw it at Watoga Station and Harper's Ferry. 
---
It won't let me, it's telling me there isn't enough room on the drive. 
---
I can make them for you no problem for free if you provide the materials needed
---
Thanks for the tip, I will definitely check it out. 
---
But its fair for some who play alot and nerf their weapons and all the hard work is gone cos a lvl 40 player cant kill fast???  What are even saying? Let everyone farm like us and they will get a strong weapon just like that.. 
---
my suggestion: make camp areas allow owner of camp to drop anything as its model, and other players can’t pick it up. Make it use allocation points if it has to, but let us decorate!
---
Yeah but i have his name I dont know if posting it could help
---
His xbox gt is Convicted64
---
Wow $1000. Lad no one cares about how much you make I’m just saying this is the wrong place to advertise as most people here are legit players that follow rules as they will get banned if they don’t. Yours truly “stupid snowflake”
---
i dont see why i had a great time last night running uranium fever and there was 7 or so ppl there all about lvl 100+ and everyone who had a tse weapon didnt use it on the legendarys only the normal miners.
---
Everyone had a melee weapon and would wak the boss and then give thumbs up to indicate they had got a hit marker :).
---
Then when everyone had hit and thumbs up we would all just rip the boss with tse.
---
Such a great time and great community i dont know why so much hate towards tse as the op  says above all other weapon variants arent upto snuff :).
---
You sir have common sense. I thank you 
---
I petty sure it does but i haven't tested it personally
---
Yeah! Did the same for me scared me but I didnt get to hear the rest of the dialouge ;(
---
This is a great idea... but to build upon that.... how about the vendors have more than 200 measly caps... and to build on it further... how about they also don’t share the same cap stash.... if I have a bunch of stuff worth caps just let me sell it... why the cap on caps... why sharing of the same cap stash... and one last build upon that... if I buy something worth 50 caps... put 50 caps back into the vendor... not 13.... bullshit 
---
You can also message RandomlettersMS on xbox. I got a very good deal from this person. I'm sure this person would happily sell you some.
---
It does not interfere with chameleon. I know because I’ve been doing this for the last 20 levels 
---
So to be clear here I found this (infinite carry weight) glitch and by the time I had a chance to report it I had asked my friends if they had heard of anyone able to do this and the response I got was that yes that’d heard about it and it was going to be patched in the following update. 
---
   In my eyes, harmless, more power to the people while waiting for Bethesda to correct the mistake of an extremely aggravatingly low stash box capacity, until I found out that it was not harmless, I then I understood why everyone was so upset. I found it just as scummy as everyone else that it was crashing the servers. I’m glad it was fixed, made the game better.
---
  However the whole point of this post is to say that removing people for playing a certain way is ludicrous. Don’t just let them off the hook obviously like block that character or something this is all so trivial in the grand scheme of things honestly.
---
Don't give the Bethesda Fun Police any ideas.
---
Side question, is a MIRV really better than a normal fatman ? I dropped a Two shot fatman a while ago and i Wonder if a mirv would make it even stronger.
---
LoL Clean your Keyboard mate looks like a ghoul sat on it hahaha :).
---
If Bethesda decides top punish cheaters then the username would be important to them as a company. 
---
I got it one piece at a time from Harpers Ferry vendor. Found a plan for legs and the deep pocket mods
---
For fucks sake yes. Why does this drop from scorchbeast queens? Ruined my night.
---
no thats stupid.
---
Cool find. Are you referring to the destroyed town in the tree that has the dismembered statue head in it? If not this is a cool place and I'm going to have to check it out next time I'm on. Also. Name checks out. 
---
Yeah but the weight they have with that perk is what they should weigh to start with considering they used to weigh 0 in previous games. We shouldn’t be forced to use 3 perk points to make them usable when Fallout has always intended people to hold a couple dozen of them 
---
You're invested into that build.
---
Tse with no perk investment one shots nearly everything all the same.
---
Not exaggerating on the loot. There were explosive and endurance bobble heads a few stairs up on tables right near each other.  There was a third perception bobble head hidden behind a stacked upright set of 10 bowling pins. The magazine was toward the top of the structure on a table and it was a Telsa. 
---
What's needed in making them? I'd still have to pay you no matter 
---
I get that they should indeed work on the major issues both in terms of balance and exploits but shits gotta move on at some stage. 
---
It's never going to be exploit free or entirely balanced.
---
I have the Chameleon Serum 300c
---
On a side note 99% of "this guy was hacking and taking no damage" posts are because someone is running this setup. People are so willfully dense and unwilling to look into anything deeper than "my awesome explosive shotgun didn't kill that guy, oh yeah right, he's a hacker. I'm reporting him" it's sad really.
---
Yeah that second suggestion looks good to me
---
The thing is that BR is really popular for fortnite, so it did attract more people. (It was also F2P) the campaigns were not). I did not stop immediately, but just never got people to join the campaign games anymore making them sometimes way too hard to finish. That did not happen before BR.
---
Meh we'll see, I just hoped they could add it to the regular game, I don't think fragmentation will help a lot also more bugs to fix.
---
If I keep playing it's to get some awesome armor like that. I have some bits and pieces but not a full set of anything, and some of my Assassin armor is just 1\* and like a wood piece or whatever. I wouldn't be motivated to grind or play for anything except armor like that, like the Assassin Cavalier or Assassin Sentinel on Heavy Combat Armor. That would be my long term end game goal. But yeah I'll probably quit or it will be nerfed into the ground before I ever get it probably.
---
Whaaaaat! I am definitely going to check on this. However, I crash even out of power armor. Are you saying remove the helmet from the suit even if it's just in your inventory?
---
So that's what happened to Eckhart's VP. No wonder he was paranoid.
---
I hope they do something its really annoying looking at all the post made by dupers
---
They need to backtrack on this. Explosive sure, but two shot no. My two shot lmg with heavy gunners does basically nothing as is, bow it's just getting sold and I've wasted perk cards.
---
been doing the same for a week, still nothing. I need protective and shielded. My rng is so bad lately. 
---
Anti armor explosive, vats fills faster.
---
Vats fills faster on a vats build leads to 100% crits
---
Negative. It’s slightly northwest of the Generals Steakhouse and is basically one set of stairs that winds up into this big multi-tree multi-level forgotten settlement. 
---
Yeah, work keyboard is a little dingy. I'm afraid it may become Scorched before too long. 
---
Don't you get issued it by a robot?
---
Do you have source that this is what they will introduce?
---
I don't know how people can say there's little to do after level 50.  I legit have spent about 100 hours and am just now searching for nuke codes for the first time at level 80
---
Could have told you in fallout 4 that two-shot and explosive effects are OP.
---
It's takes no skill to one shot the ground and decimate 20 feet in every direction with one bullet, dummy.

Then the smart idea is to simply seperate the two, and only nerf the one that needs it.
---
How much you selling it for ?
---
OH EM GEE THAS GAHMS SAW BRAWKIN! 
---
Just keep grinding, and check every piece of armor, two of mine are titled "poisoner's" 
---
Also I find this whole ordeal hilarious because the dupers also have full sets of that armor without a doubt. Most people who don't know about it are gonna go into PvP servers all gung ho and get a nasty awakening.
---
On a lead node with 2 iron deposits in camp. Next to a railroad so I made a depot.
---
Try not to get caught up with your delusions of grandeur. You're not the Punisher, you're just an arsehole.
---
If you run into one, just report them and move on. What you're doing is just stroking your own ego.
---
I get you now. You are right that they could have chosen a different path to balancing out the game instead of messing with what people put so much time into. Waiting this long to nerf the TSEs does highlight how much they are still figuring things out. 
---
Ok im done with 76.
---
I'm pretty sure you only get half the bounty when you kill a wanted player. Saw a 30 cap bounty go down to 15 when I fast traveled to them. Why Bethesda has not made this clear is unknown.
---
I did not, I just stopped as people stopped playing the PvE content, I could not find groups anymore and that was directly linked to the release. Of course that is not required for fallout except for scorchbeast queen event.
---
But there shouldn’t be strong weapons at all. Who will use the 38 pistol anymore past level 5? Who will use the machete? 
---
These weapons are lonely, and neglected. No one cares about them anymore, and hopefully these nerfs will make them more attractive.
---
No because I use a melee weapon. Mine ain't going anywhere.
---
I got Marine Shielded from Census Violence a few days back, so can confirm this is the place to get it. Now, if I could just get Raider Protected and Shielded, and if there was only a way to get Casual Shielded, I would have them all.

I ran into one with a pit filled with tesla traps, or maybe it was the radiation traps, that were triggered with pressure plates. The creator had tried to hide the pit with a bunch of those bone chime traps hanging over it but you could still see the pit. It might had got me if not for fast travel. 
---
Was a total game changer for me when that first happened in a server I was on
---
Any luck man? Couldn't find a small animal tonight, going to try again tomorrow
---
ive only had 2 since yesterday.
---
will see how we go tonight friday night should be fun :).
---
I second this because I use it. Sadly we haven't had any word if this is ban able but I'm not banned so...
---
Fingers crossed.
---
They should put a cap to it like they did with the legendary weight redux on armor (e.g. weapons weight 20% less) which reduces weight but only to a maximum of 90% (not sure). For exemple, you should be able to stack up to 5 (idk) bobbleheads of the same type.
---
And of course, they should fix the timer issue...
---
Unmarked camp, as in the US-13C place? 
---
Diminishing returns. The events in my mind don't scale well. 
---
Great for low to mid level. Not so much once you hit level cap.
---
hahaha nice work ;).
---
have a great weekend friend 
---
Cheers for the confirmation. Will keep at it) gl on the others! 
---
Pretty sure OP was making fun of devs decision. So yea.... pull that stick outta ur ass 
---
Yes, if you don't have the cap requirements they are greyed out.
---
Im with this guy. If this goes out im done. How the fouck about they nerf bobbleheads instead.
---
yea 50% would have made it just like the 2 shot weapons from fallout 4, but 25% is just bad
---
If you dont have some of the materials I'll still do it for like 50 caps just to cover material cost
---
If it is a global supply drop, or the container is already open, you are fine. If is says "Steal From" and it is locked, that's a supply drop requested by someone else, and if you pick the lock, you will become wanted.
---
Never had a problem with that. Scorched at Morgantown Airport drop those like rain during the event. I usually get there around lvl 4-5. There's really nothing in the game, as far as I know, that you **CAN'T** obtain naturally. The levels in this game are very forgiving. Which is why the guy above saying it sounded so weird to me.
---
Yes there is
---
Can we get away to message a server to let people know we need help or want to sell or look to buy items? Also think it would be really cool if especially lower level players could hire another player as a body guard could show as an event maybe idk but would definitely be a fun way to play with ransoms .
---
Awesome 
---
Yes they were. My favorite drop was a two shot hunting rifle I used for my first play through!
---
How do you know? Did you ass-k her?
---
Hey I do feel events dont pay out well enough but i love doing them still always love looking on the map see what events are active and just go in solo get em done ;)
---
The hell? Pretty sure there’s no NPCs that aren’t robots 
---
Obviously this is the most heavily requested feature. Tons of posts on the sub every week asking for it. Can anyone with a game dev background (or anything else relevant) give a legitimate reason for Bethesda not implementing this by now? I’m not trying to throw shade, just trying to wrap my brain around why it hasn’t happened yet
---
Awesome! Thanks for the confirmation. Will be dusting off my garb tonight!
---
I'm sorry but I must agree here .. in a game based around hoarding known for attracting hoarders which rewards hoarding … please leave it to the developers to determine who is actually a duper/cheater than take it upon yourselves to see if the witch floats or drowns.
---
This new option will create a new set of servers effectively removing a section of players away from "normal" servers onto pvp servers? Please say this us the case. 
---
Lol just like the real dmv 😂 
---
Does it still prevent said diseases and airborn effects?
---
Well I use a rifle, mine "ain't going anywhere" either. But its damage is sure as hell going down.
---
Yeah. You fire a 2 shot weapon and it pretty much forks at the berrel. 2sh accuracy is nil.
---
No, it's called use a gun and shoot the guy with a melee weapon. It's not the games fault that you are trash and can't shoot a gunless person. 
---

And unlock safes etc.
---
So if I'm pvping someone at their camp and I know I'm abt to die soon, I just destroying a building and I only lose 5 caps rather than 92 (my current level)
---
There aren't any plans for Wood Armor listed in the ESM file, so you cannot learn to craft it. What was the name if the plan you found? If it was "Shrouded" then that's a mod you can apply to wood armor, it doesn't let you craft arms, legs, and torso pieces.
---
It’s one of many that can spawn around the map, you can farm them for weird stuff like civil war era suit / dress plans 
---
Well yes that is what pacifist is for. I probably shouldn't have posted this whilst intoxicated, what I do mean is that multiple game modes will have popular modes and dry up the others.
---
I just hope this doesn't mean anything for the future, I would like all content for a single modus. We will have to see what this mode is though.
---
They’re really dropping the ball with this update, tse weapons are the only way to deal decent damage to certain enemies. It’s going to be impossible to kill certain things now, these nerfs should only apply to using the weapons against other players, not everything in the game. 
---
Can we combine stimpackes to make super ones
---
Ow wait so ur telling me that im max at everything and play and do everything in this game with two character one 140lvl the other 164lvl  with all perk and strongest weapons and i cant 1 shot any enemies?? 😂 then wow why i even continue playing if all the weapon are the same dmg and shit haaaa!! 
---
Straight jackets would like to have a word with you. Like 5 of them is 200 caps heh
---
I knew at least one person was gonna comment that. I wish I could laugh. 
---
All I wanna do is complete recruitment blues but i can't; too much time wasted doing this for nothing. 
---
I found those power connecting towers to be an absolute royal pain in my ass. It seems they like to float.
---
Think again. My armor makes me effectively unkillable "dummy" why don't you go do some research about what's actually op in this game and quit talking out your ass. I'll see you in the PvP servers. And NOTHING you have explosive or not will tickle me. Idiot.
---
Someone clearly likes doing it in the can.
---
...I'll just see myself out. \*hangs head in shame\*
---
I’m running a trap base right now and have a 12 play kill count from it..oven or lock and hold method I’m on PS4 
---
&gt; I feel like your definition of large must be dlc size worthiness. Mayor for a day was annoyingly long
---
No, in terms of content, Mistress of Mysteries is perhaps a fifth of Far Harbor or Nuka World
---
Gunsmith is a thing.
---
With the exception of getting the junk mail from the mail box, the entire quest can be done without leaving the building. You have to fight through some trash mobs, but they are like level 9. 
---
The problem with Bethesda's nerf is that it doesn't change the market much at all. TSE is still going to be a top tier weapon while punishing those that have only either of those effects, something no one seems to be having any issue with.
---
Beyond that they're more dealing with the symptom and not the cause - the bobblehead stacking.
---
Hey man he just got out of a bad breakup, cut the dude some slack
---
No it was me i was referring to. You responded to like 4 or 5 different posts of mine simultaneously and appeared to have gone through my post history.  
---
According to the tool-tip it does.
---
14 hours of masturbation is though!
---
And people jumped down my throat when I had 1000 hours in Fallout 4 after like 8 months. 
---
You're dedicated, mate! But no judgement from me, do what makes you happy. 
---
Yea, because you used a explosive weapon. It's op, so get over it. You are exactly the type of the person this thread is about. It's so boring seeing the same posts all day. It's changing and there isn't enough you can do about it. You have no power, now sit back.
---
I understand your point of view but when a lvl 17 has 4000 bulk springs and more its pretty obvious that he duped
---
&gt; I take no damage from them, or anything for that matter.
---
Yes I'm familiar with how you achieve this. Enjoy it while it lasts, most games don't let builds that literally make you invincible stick around.
---
You literally made the exact same thread 20 minutes ago.
---
Yeah, in the past they've dealt with similar issues but only told us when the patch notes came out.
---
I wish they'd tell us sooner when it's things people have been (understandably) frustrated by, but it's better than not fixing it at all.
---
And if you take out all the annoying wandering and trying to figure stuff out, it has little
---
It's only going to be good if everyone starts on an equal footing. PVE servers are plagued and broken by TSEs, there is a nerf incoming sure but these weapons remain broken still so allowing them in a 100% pvp settiing is a no go.
---
If anyone dumb enough.....smh
---
How do you think soda is made? You're lucky if its boiled first. 
---
You have to leave for the postmarked letter and again for the seal. Not sure after that but I'm afraid it'll happen again at this point. It's not the mobs I'm angry about it's the multiple loading screens and time one has to wait. 
---
Its grey.
---
Depends what you need to do in order to install it
---
I think hacking and picking are the way they are so you can’t share level 3 lock picking with your whole team :-/
---
Not yet to the best of my knowledge. 
---
No. I guess I just ass-umed it was cool.
---
They also ***need*** to bufd lots of weapon's damage (Tommy Gun, Minigun, Gatling Laser to name a few), cause right now we don't exactly have alot of good guns, and most of these guns I juat said are just big ammo wasters when used on higher level enemies.
---
What's the point of going for a heavy weapon loadout when only about 3 of the many 'heavy' weapons are actually viable? (Gatling Gun, 50 cal MG and Fat-Man. Missile Launcher is outclassed by Fat-Man and is only good for airborne targets like the Cargobot. Gatling Lasers use Fusion Cores which could've been powering up your Power Armor. Miniguns do terrible damage. Gatling Plasmas degrade incredibly quickly and are rather costly to repair. The Auto Grenade Launcher died the moment they made it not get any benefits from Bear Arms or other Heavy perks and The Flamer, while pretty powerful, goes through ammo like Pac-Man through dots and you barely get any ammo for it in the wild or by crafting)
---
Then you perma-die at level 5
---
I don’t know why bethesda thought stackable bobbleheads was a good idea. 
---
We have all had our missions sucks yours is that one but I would just go do a few more things and then try it again 
---
You'll get an email and if that is what you actually did you'll get it lifted.
---
How should a stick be equal in combat utility to a gun? Answer me that.
---
Its something to do with the HUD and refresh rates imo.
---
Similarly, I would crash everytime when I have vsync off and go into any vendor menu.
---
Since running it in borderless window, with a reduced refresh rate as a result- it stopped and I CTD less.
---
Yes and sold one
---
I don't know what the frequency is like but there should be the option for some dud rolls from random loot, no matter what level.
---
Maybe certain exceptions like major bosses or quest end situations but aside from that, both high roll and low roll RNG.
---
Delete this post, you are blowing my (and your) looting spots. I used to go to watoga, but that became well known.
---
So i dont get this exactly...so does the explosive damage leg effect add +100% damage on top of the gun damage? I always thought it was only the perk that added the EXTRA damage? and that the explosive leg effect just changed the type of shot to an ae shot but the same base damage?
---
You got banned?
---
So one perk that doubles damage isn't too strong?
---
Nerf people.
---
If you alternate hands it's considered exercise.
---
E w w w
---
Oh yes. I'd love to play through a third time. 
---
Lol Jesus why so much bulk on you wow 
---
That sounds awesome! Always gonna do it this way now.
---
Along comes fisto
---
Can I have your stuff!
---
And there's only 4 parts lol
---
Gain access to the office and search the office
---
(optional) look for clues to meeting place
---
Find meeting place
---
Search the bodies and become the new mistress lol
---
Done? Done duping?
---
Ohhhhh oohhhhh ohhhhh ohhhh ohhhh
---
The seal can be obtained without leaving the building. I just did it two days ago. 
---
Hence why the TSE nerf is the least of people's worries. I'm enjoying it but I'm SURE it'll be nerfed. I'm trying to spread the word and cure the ignorance. There are counters to everything in this game. You just have to strategize. Think and use the tools you are given/can acquire.
---
I see someone ran through and grabbed all the clipboards before you could grab them, too.
---
Lol why I am never glad I got one just have a single explosive lever works just as well for me
---
I’m gay 
---
Ok if your armor is so awesome than you have no reason to bitch about what weapons you use now, because you are unkillable right. Enjoy the nerf, lmao. 
---
Well here’s the thing, even if they made the two effects unique so they couldn’t appear of the same weapon, they would still need to nerf both by half to get to the +50% damage. 
---
But look on the bright side, you’ll now get more legendaries because you can no longer one shot those three ⭐️⭐️⭐️ legendaries with your 400% dame TSE shotgun which would have resulted in no loot. 
---
And exclude crappy items as well, nobody wants a 3 star lead pipe or pipe pistol
---
I agree with a dismissal feature. Try taming something else, my mirelurk king replaced my sloth easily. The sloth is broken and gets stuck super easy. Mirelurk hasn't been stuck, or my original deathclaw.
---
Believe me us devs want to (im not affiliated with B.). However for exploits its not a good idea to advertise a fix is incoming or even tell people youve fixed one.
---
posting duped crap? uhhh what?
---
You wanted to see these posts, or you wouldn't have made one. TSE is getting nerfed into the ground. It is op I am not disagreeing, but melee is op and needs a nerf too.
---
deathclaws yes, but scorchbeasts have very good explosive resistance even a TSE Shotgun has a bit of trouble with them
---
I just like how it took this long for people to find out about the stacking. 
---
The quest marker lead me out of the building to the courthouse second floor, then back. The DMV and courthouse are separate buildings. Is there another seal upstairs or something?
---
I suspect they can check by item type. They can't tell if you actually duped items, because items don't have an unique ID but just a standard ID and a count of the item you have. A thousand rounds of .308 is hardly abnormal, but a thousand Nuka Cola Quantums is probably not an accident, never mind bobble heads or TSE's. Assuming OP is innocent, I am assuming they had a lot of one specific item, enough to reach arguably ludicrous levels, and it triggers an auto-ban. OP should appeal if innocent.
---
Is trading in-game items for real currencies a violation of ToS? I know ither games have that rule.
---
What does the jet pack even do? Can you fly?
---
Have you used a godroll melee Build yet?
---
Yes. Honestly wasn't duping, they probably saw the 4000+ shotgun shells I got from a sack and assumed I was. 
---
Not really. If they wanted to balance it, just make it consume two pieces of ammo per shot. That’s a simple compromise. 
---
That's where you're wrong
---
The only to be ever been killed in PvP was the exact opposite. A guy was plinking at me with his rifle doing slap damage right in front of me, I shot him in the head with my shotgun down to half health and then he one-shotted me with a pool cue. Pretty embarrassing. 
---
You do know that it's all explosives that are being nerfed, right?
---
I am a melee user. That's all I use really. I feel in PVE it's fine... but in PvP I wreck everyone in a few seconds. Unless they try to maneuver. With a jetpack marsupial doesn't even matter. If they use no stimpacks 2-3 power shots and everyone dies. There's seemingly no counter. Except for TSE I guess but I played around with some friends the other day and with no stats in rifles or bobble heads my buddy could kill me at medium distance with the shotgun and any range with 2 shots from a handmade rifle. That's broken to me.
---
I thought the seal is in the same cell? Don't you just have to walk through the doorway on the right that ghouls spawn from and through a hole then fight your way through the capital building?
---
&gt; PVP tacked onto an inherently PVE game is rarely more than a niche.  
---
Agreed. I've never seen high demand for a mainstream, online no rules server type or even PVP in general. I get that some like it, that's cool. And I hope its different for FO76, but I suspect its more of what's come before:  A vocal minority driving changes that affect - directly or indirectly - the majority PVE player base.  As we see with the dev statement specific to TSE weapons that's happening now. I find that troubling, but its too late:  The cycle of nerf kicked off by PVP has begun, and it won't end with TSE.
---
It worked! Thank you. Now I'm ready to take over the world with my sweet sweet shielded lining.
---
Stash was full sadly.
---
Get closer.  You know, for science.
---
Guns shoot bullets and a melee weapon has to be right on top of you for you to be hit. This isn't even up for debate. Case closed. If you simply can't use a GUN to kill a MELEE person, then you are TRASH. 
---
I did, and hopefully after following their instructions it will. I'm just wanting to warn anyone else that has seen the cursed bags of treasure, and thought it was a good idea to pick them up.
---
I'm not bitching about weapons, I'm bitching about nerfing the wrong shit and people who are uninformed directing their hatred towards a weapon type that is supposed to be op. It would have been acceptable to down it to fallout 4 levels (50%) instead they are gutting it because of ignorant complaining.
---
Nah, not from what I saw. They are two entirely separate buildings across the courtyard from one another. 
---
I’m down. Currently at work, will send request once I’m home. 
---
Nope, can’t place it again once you store it. 
---
OP is clueless. My grandmother almost had a heart attack seeing the amount of damage my 2 shot could do. I’d personally go further and ban everyone in possession of one. That’ll show those rascals.
---
Well, it’s virtual credits so it’s not truly real currency.
---
That said, people who do this are terrible and most, of not all, are dupers. OP admitting to having just sold one suggests he is either a duper or extremely lucky to find another so quick. 
---
I'm comfortable with my sexuality.
---
Bye
---
Lol okay and?I’m melee main anyways it was just my long range weapon and it will still be good just take a extra shot or two so no biggy really
---
I like my blue suit, but depending on male/female and the bulk of the armor, it can range from flattering to... ahem...  not-so.
---
Wow! “Many others” lmao. 
---
I've been playing since beta and I have no answers for this question.
---
From my experience so far if you store a crafted item that friend did and you don’t have the plans for said item it will not let you place.  It will though take up build storage
---
it's really not, because I have had some really interesting and fun cat and mouse PvP experiences. Sadly they mostly occur from levels 5-20 . High level stuff it's usually like two global super powers: Whomever has the initiative wins.
---
Yep been wanting this for ages.
---
so noone knows?
---
I can kill melee guys all day, what I can't do is keep up with DPS on an enemy like the queen. If and when future raid content is released, you will be gimped for picking anything other than melee.
---
If you are standing at the entry looking at the counter with the bots, turn to the right. It is a little bit of a winding path, but get to the main hall and turn right again. I can't remember if you have to go upstairs or not. But the seal is sitting on top of either a safe or filing cabinet. 
---
Kinda, but not really.
---
Does what it did in FO4.  It also excels at devouring fusion cores. 
---
Yes you can fly
---
the enemies aren't bullet spongey if your weapons are in level range, upgraded, and have armor penetration.
---
Bases on pvp servers will be used more for defense. It'd be stupid to be penalized for shooting someone's turrets or a wall they're hiding behind. If there has to be bounties to make people happy, then make them set by a player, like GTA bounties. 
---
Oh! Does taming a new one get rid of one that currently at your C.A.M.P.? I read in the original mega-post (that sort of brought taming to many peoples attention) that you could have multiple pets. But I've never tried.
---
I'll give it a shot though! Nothing can be worst that what I've already got going on there
---
Well obviously you need protection from cazadors
---
Player hub, some sort of level based looking for group auto queue group. 
---
I heard they’re nerfing melee too.
---
Seriously, might as well go ahead and say nerf the loo... err... Caught myself.
---
As for the top paragraph I disagree. Generally two good things are better than one, and if both are rare to get together they should of course be better than a single one of either.
---
That being said I totally agree with your second point. They should just stop the bobbleheads from being stacked
---
I call bullshit.
---
"two shot explosives are op so let's make them useless"
---
Bethesda, 2019
---
Mmmm. $60 dollars to eat. I'd get some pizza, probably just something cheap like Dominos thin crust pepperoni, and some of those spicy nuggets and a pasta bowl. Then some Fanta pineapple. Did you know that it was created in Nazi Germany because of a trade embargo, crazy right? I always thought it was from Mexico. Anyway, Smarties makes giant size smarties called smoothies that I like, so I'd get some of those two. Then probably a decent steak. I wish Arby's still had their homestyle fries, I liked those. Also some Barq Rootbeer. After that I'd probally have enough money left over to make some basic tacos at home... I'm trying to eat less junk food and sugar so that's all I can think about now. What were you on about, TSE nerfs or something? Oh, wasabi peas too! I've had them in snack mixes but have never bought just them. Those probably aren't that fattening so I'll get some tomorrow. (I'm totally going to cheat and get some of that sweet, sweet, Nazi soda too!)
---
Same. I've thought "how does that work?" but never investigated it.
---
The guy in charge of weapon balance must play a bloodied melee build and is salty about the TSE people, so they must be nerfed, cause bloodied melee is the most overpowered thing since the BFG, not at all.
---
If you want me to, ill put down recommended perks that will help you in surviving Appalachia. Just comment 
---
Might be worth inquiring about over a couple of cold Heiney's.
---
Didn't they already do that once?
---
Well, go cry to the dupers for spreading the weapon to the point that it became a common weapon. Then blam all the trolling players who couldn't learn how to be responsible with the god tier weapon. They are nerfing the RIGHT stuff and frankly it should have been sooner. But bless it be that it is finally happening. I'm living for all these tears today.
---
i got it as a level 50, and with the two hand perks and twisted muscles, i got that up to about 320 damage. it is a pretty decent melee weapon. i still use it although i use rifles now. 
---
As long as it's a pan-galactic gargleblaster, you're set.
---
I know! I'm just never in those neighborhoods
---
Ah sorry I was referring to MIRV frag grenades. The MIRV Fatman reduces the damage on the stats, but that’s because it only lists the damage of each bomblet, there’s like 6-8 of them. There’s a whole mess of concerns this causes with high armor enemies and whatever but against most reasonable enemies you come out quite far ahead.
---
What really sucks about it is that it becomes a lot harder to aim, because the MIRVs split and drop almost straight down afterwards, limiting range. If you like the Hail Mary shots, don’t mod it. If you like to blow the shit out of stuff and then explode their bits to bits as well, then mod it. Also it makes it easier to kill yourself in the blast too.
---
Me too
---
Hasn’t happened since adjusting this. Without jinxing it, thanks. 
---
But only some of them does, maybe there is glowing variant lol
---
To be fair, a similar likeness has been used before as well. He bears a striking resemblance to Cyrus Temple in SR3. 
---
The enemies aren't the problem end game with any weapon. if someone is finding pve challenging after level 50 they are not built correctly or have poor grasp of game mechanics and or weapons. The problem I'm discussing or inquiring is about PvP balance. It players fight and their weapons are equal level- is not fun for either if the fight is over in less than 3 hits. There is not much skill or thrill in that for either party. It becomes unchallenging and cheap.  
---
Hasn’t happened to me now since changing it to half way. But I haven’t been to Whitesprings yet. 
---
You rock!
---
I recall getting quite a bit water after claiming them and when defending them.  Maybe that’s what it’s referring to?
---
Let's not nerf two shot please? They are not that great on their own, helpful but definitely not game breaking. Its the combination. This goes through I'm selling my two shot lmg, as it's useless at that point.
---
Dude in blue screen at least 4 times a night ps4 and get discon'd on top of it. She's def lucky
---
i feel like bethesda should allow us a pass if we lost our junk that way. if we fall into a fissure on accident we should be able to keep our stuff. especially if you’re chasing the scorchbeast and now paying attention to the ground like,,,rlly 
---
&gt; As for the top paragraph I disagree. Generally two good things are better than one, and if both are rare to get together they should of course be better than a single one of either. 
---
Then you're agreeing with me. What am I missing? I'm saying all the nerfs do is bring all those weapons down so TSE still stays on top. Just not as powerful as it use to be.
---
thats something you need to bring up to the devs.  Bobbleheads shouldnt stack and if they do by design then it should be changed.  Make sure the right thing is getting nerfed or else you are not fixing the problem.  Even with the explosive nerf they will still one shot everything if they can stack bobbleheads like that.
---
The word "misunderstanding" would seem to mean that the dev team and the community team had some miscommunication. "This was a misunderstanding in what was being addressed with these mods" says to me that the final wording is what was originally planned but whoever was writing the article missed something in their notes or misunderstood the intent.
---
Lol well I have most cards unlocked like they say adapt or die
---
dude just tryna say hello don’t be rude 
---
I'll still be here, Beth. We got ya.
---
I’ve found a few but only really farmed the Mire. Damn witch plans never appeared for me.
---
But this sounds neat! I’ll keep an eye out.
---
Thank you, i will definitely look to see if i can fit those in there. 
---
If he would quit staring at me and do something that would be more polite
---
I'll ask but she prefers Butt-weiser.
---
he’s shy,,,, leave my man alone
---
Wait, how are you going to eat it? Did you buy a physical copy? Are you going to put the digital copy in a DVD and you're going to eat that? I'm so confused.
---
That does seem feasible. I do own the game, and play the game, just for the record. I do like it. Just the caps for fast travel, upon release, it felt off. I'm simply a miser I suppose. 
---
The thing is that a melee weapon is not a gun. You can shoot a melee person so easily. It's not hard. You are using a weapon shooting projectiles. 
---
They are nerfing one of the right things, and way too harshly. There is a long list of things that need nerfed, including melee, regardless of your opinion. You'll see what I mean in a few weeks when everyone is saying sentinel assassin, and cavalier assassin need nerfed.
---
First off, where did I say that it is so easy? Do you even English, bro? I said it exists, and that *I would like* for it to be easy, safe, reliable and convenient. Currently it's none of those things, so please don't pull stuff out of your ass and attribute it to me. That's all you.
---
Secondly, no, you CANNOT tell me why I want something, and project your nonsense onto others. No, I won't want it to bypass the stash limit. I gave you an example of why I wanted it, which is a real situation I found myself in recently. Another good example is that my melee char is drowning in ammo that he never uses. Meanwhile my other characters are often short. Giving me the ability to transfer all the ammo from unarmed character, quickly and easily, to my other characters would be great. 
---
And...dear god, "the truth comes out"? Seriously? Oh, lawd... I told you there's *multiple* ways to accomplish what you are against already in the game. And it's not going anywhere. And I'm just asking for an easy, safe, reliable and convenient way of doing it. As opposed to the current methods. Current situation is not stopping me or anybody else from moving items around. It's just not easy, or unsafe, or unreliable (if server craps out during char switch) or convenient (if your friends are offline). That's all. Reading comprehension. Try it.
---
I could also find you a Bethesda rep post, form this very subreddit, saying that it's a great idea as a reply to identical suggestion, and they will pass it on to the devs. Not that it'll do any good.
---
And *ALL* of this you dumped on me *just* for asking for an example of an item you can equip but not obtain yourself. Which you *STILL* haven't done. Why do I even bother?
---
I'd use it if it had deep pockets available 🤣
---
That shroud with increase sneak speed is very nice, I even found an unyielding level 45. But no deep pockets mod. It's just duct tape on the outside. Anything can be done pockets with enough duct tape. 
---
I reckon vault 76 will be reopened as a horrific dungeon with piles of dead corpse piled high by the entrance. 
---
&gt;  Jangles the Moon Monkey
---
I was in (I think) AVR Medical the other day and stumbled across a Jangles with a toy alien stuck to it's face on a gurney. If I can figure out how to get screenshots from my PS4 to my PC, I'll come back with a pic. 
---
Yeah I think so, maybe in the first or second big patch?
---
Same here mate. Fuck Bethesda. They might never recover from this. I know I won't be playing this game a long time until it gets fixed and if Anthem turns out to be as expected I won't be coming back at all. 
---
Untrue. That's the people salty about TSE Nerf crying out for that.
---
The potential to nullify most melee damage already exists in the game and has since launch.
---
They won't hear you, until they are on a server with themselves at level 523 and a few random level 1-20 alts running around the map. Then they will be like hmmm I wonder what happened to all the players. I guess that carrot that had them grinding for months at Whitespring turned into a pumpkin at midnight and they all went home.
---
Good thing I really don't care, I know what happened. Either Bethesda will lift my ban, or not. Regardless of the outcome I'm giving people a heads up so that they won't have to deal with this.
---
I cant fast travel, you know, because I'm constantly overencumbered.....
---
The leveling system still somewhat confuses me, honestly. People say Fallout 4's leveling system dumbed it down, but if that's so, 76 just through something at the wall and used what stuck.
---
They did! I totally wanted to find some clipboards but no one knows where to get them.
---
THIS!!!
---
Sans any player trading stations, isn’t whitespring already this?
---
here’s my advice..
---
FUCKING RUN!!!!😳😳😳😳😳
---
A good tip would be to put them in stuff like Lucky Break (Non-PA Only), Break of the Draw (Lvl 1 Version), Ammosmith (If you're like me and go through tons of shitty rounds), White Knight (Armor Durability), Gunsmith (Gun durability), Starched Genes (Mutation protector/protection) and Super Duper (30% Chance to duplicate when crafting) 
---
Yeah me too, it's also annoying when you're playing and your server crashes from dupers' inventory lag.
---
yeah, I agree. The system for PvP has potential but I don't feel like they tested all the angles enough and it needs to be replaced. The C.A.M.P. system seems to force you to choose between Defense and vanity which is fine but even if you build only turrets a well boxed generator and extractor.. ( cause what else is worth protecting?) Those turrets aren't stopping anyone and bounties are easy to lose if you bring a buddy. There's no real gain from destroying a base though... so you lose caps to a friend or to a stranger for a small power Trip.
---
I can speak for myself and my small group of friends, we are all with you on this.  I'll stop touching anything BGS if this abomination of a nerf happens.
---
Yes, I have one to sell if you're on PC. 
---
I could understand comparable damage, the size and velocity of the object being swung, effecting the damage of the melee weapon, but it's not comparable, and especially won't be once ranged players have their only tool to keep up taken away.
---
why's that?
---
This happens to me in fallout 4 all the time, too. I have exactly enough wood to make the last wall? Too bad. No wall for me. It's super frustrating. 
---
No PS4 
---
&gt; Hence why the TSE nerf is the least of people's worries. 
---
[I've actually posted about this previously.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag2ghn/now_for_something_completely_different_legendary/)
---
Neither TSE weapons nor builds that make you invincible are healthy for the game. Both need to be brought in to line. In a perfect world yes your build and gear should give you an advantage however that advantage shouldn't be dealing 800% as much damage and/or being effectively invincible.
---
How fun will PvP actually be when you have teams of un-killable players just throwing ammo at eachother? How fun will it be for a casual player who has is caught up in that?
---
Stalkers Walking Cane sounds like it'd be amazing for a RP build but it's really amazing at being painfully pointless.
---
Next time, find someone random in the zone and ask to team up in case one of you crashes. 
---
It’s also nice if both have Rad Sponge so you help each other out as well. 
---
My main issue right now is if I didn't find a lvl 30 TSE Lever-action Revolver in a shop at lvl 25, I wouldn't have progressed as quickly to lvl 35 because I would have been completely dry on ammo in the mean time. Having to forcibly fight 3 Scorchbeasts while walking my ass to Lucky Hole Mine for lead would have been a much more painful ordeal if my TSE weapon was weakened since the best dmg I could get was ~60/shot from my hunting rifle vs ~200 from my TSE.
---
He’s just standing there, menacingly!
---
I think it might affect the rate of harvest. For example Charleston Landfill has Water (3), and a water purifier spawns there naturally. That purifier spawns Purifed Water x5 like every couple minutes, but holds a maximum of 5. So if you babysit the harvester you can build up water really fast.
---
Hmmm that might be a possibility. Would have to see if the amounts of food on the map match the event rewards. Kind of lame if thats the case though. 5 tatos for powering up a plant? Loll There should be a renewable resource like the extractors or the fusion core generators.
---
I'm more confused about why accidental pvp is a thing
---
yeeeeaaaah, took my eye off my tv for a few seconds bam mini fissor, thought it was just some toxic barrels at first.
---
Friend me on the game and I'll show you .   ugiron
---
Can we rename it .25 shot now
---
Well you better lay off the bobbleheads then or you'll kill the old bird!
---
yeah, true but everyone who buddies up or haunts white springs has one or knows who to get one from. 
---
And melee requires any skill LOL please....
---
It replaced my sloth when I tamed the mirelurk king, so yea it gets rid of the useless sloth. You can only have one pet. And when your new tame arrives, your sloth will be kill able by you, for revenge. My mirelurk is beastly, but I highly miss my deathclaw.
---
Sounds like he’s already eating what they’ve squeezed out.
---
ohh yeah and the radiation, i mean that’s fine but falling in? that shit sucks. i recommend teaming and using rad sponge, shits gr8 
---
I think I was on that server with you guys. I was a lvl. 40ish wearing the oh so distinctive excavator Power Armor. I spent the majority of the time up the butt of the queen with a shotgun lmao! The server disconnected rather suddenly though so that was a disappointment.
---
Upvoting for doom reference,
---
Is this really needed? I feel like this sub has been asking since the beginning of it's time.
---
(They should listen really..)
---
Exactly...Eventually, you will have your stats set just the way you wanted them, every perk card you could ever hope for in multiple levels, and still have a bunch of unused level-ups with nothing worth spending them on.  Being able to perfectly fine tune your character for every situation you might encounter should be a long term goal, not something you need to rush.
---
with a jetpack and actin boy rank 3 , canned coffee and timing it doesn't matter. You can kill someone hoping around or they kill you and themselves using an explosive shot gun.
---
Same here man!
---
I got an email saying there was a recent change in my account. I panicked, submitted a ticket right away, and in turn got an email that I got banned.
---
Good way to find out lol
---
Yea so there should be a water purifier somewhere at every workshop then? That still doesn’t solve the food question. 
---
It would be a nice benefit to get a steady supply of juicy steaks while you farm fusion cores :p
---
To be clear I can build light combat armor and mod it to bos heavy armor
---
What platform are you on? 
---
I have every CAMP plan, aka I have bought hundreds of doubles lulz 
---
I have 5/5 gunsmith and that luck perk. With **75%** reduced damage I will need my gun to last longer and more ammo.
---
Bruh! Where the hell do you have the time? Like that's a 1/3 of my skyrim Hours over 7 years. Like do you even have a job?
---
Not judging you but I'm really questioning your priorities in life...
---
Just don't be all "W-ASS-UP!" in front of her, otherwise you might get a slap across the backside of your head.
---
Did you have a workshop?
---
Yeah, the game came out November 14 2018. It's been 1536 hours since the games release. They have played more then half of those hours. It's either bullshit or really depressing. 
---
Please revert TSE back, this was one of the only reason why I play because even though there isn’t’ much content it was nice knowing you could run around with you gun feeling confident. Now they take away my only reason I play because it was unfair in PvP which is shit to begin with and is more irrelevant than the storyline in the game. They did not even bother to need it 10% or 15% but a full 80% and 75%!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME. THERE ARE only 800,000 people playing this game and you want to deny them content you promise and nerf the most fun weapons to use. Great, just f**** great.
---
What’s wrong with me ? ;( 
---
Might be a ban. I've seen similar error codes posted from people who were banned.
---
well, bringing a knife to a gunfight is the melee challenge but they can stagger the gun user who then can't reload. plus if your built right and tanky you can close that distance. Unless they kill you before you leave for even can accept... which happens sometimes
---
I also liked that look and it's what I've worn til about a week ago when I switched over to Raider Leathers. 
---
This is the line for people who can’t find the line.
---
You are going to keep leveling and you keep getting 'packs' every 5 levels.  By the time you hit level 80, you'll have all you need plus a bunch of unused levels ups with nothing to spend them on.  At least at the moment you still have a REASON to level, that will go away eventually, so why rush it?
---
Bethesda team? Answers please? 
---
Stop being small minded man. You obviously havent traded before.
---
When you have something that everyone wants, and you cant reply to everyone, does that make you a douche canoe? Think man, think.
---
can't even get back in, touch the ground and it's instant death. even using Radsheild and powerarmor.
---
No, I'm on PS4.
---
turns out my internet is rubbish
---
I’ve had a lot of lag issues in the silos. The mainframe cores at the end are the most noticeable.  Click on all 15.  It may be up to a minute before they’re removed and added to my inventory.  Almost as slow when picking them up around the room. 
---
This also apparently has the same bug as ignition cores where the game will scrap other instances of the item being crafted to make more if the raw materials aren’t available, as ignition cores (unless this has been patched) and mainframe cores are not protected from auto-scrapping. 
---
You’ve been banned.
---
Nah just joking.  I kept getting that (or something close) and had to reinstall.
---
yeah, fuck dat green shit 
---
Pacifist mode should be.. pacifist mode.
---
0 damage done to other players, 0 damage done to the player. 
---
the best melee build doesn't use power armor because it lowers your damage output. Strength is capped in power armor damage wise
---
It’s a good thing there are thousands of us that will keep on playing
---
Excellent argument. I have no counter points to make 
---
you scared me tbh
---
happened to me as well and I submitted a bug report to BGS - their response was that I need to change my video card.  The game worked fine before the update so not sure where that was coming from...
---
I was roaming around and saw a bag on the ground. I went over, thinking someone dropped some junk they didn't need. I go over to the bag to see what treasures are in there. It's a bunch of stimpaks. I mean, like at least 20. Before I grab any, I notice another paper bag. This one has ammo in it. Then another with various foods. And a few more with various goodies. I follow the bags like "oooo piece of candy" until I get to a camp. Standing in the middle of this simple camp is a player in a clown outfit, mask and all, holding a gun. He or she or whatever was about a level 90 I think. I was only a level 25 or so at the time. I wave but the player does not wave back. They move a little bit so I know they weren't AFK. I know I want no part of whatever this person is planning so I book it out of there, leaving the paper bags behind. They left the server not long after that.
---
😬
---
 They can nerf Ts but can’t buff THE WHOLE ENERGY WEAPON CLASS.. nice beth 
---
Oh yeah I had luck, bad luck.  I tamed a deathclaw and then had let another deathclaw kill it.  Now my budget is at 110% and I can't even build a stash. :(
---
But tell me what you consider as proof? You want me to give you my email account so you can look at Bethesda for a reply? Do you think I have nothing better to do than create fake news? Come on man.
---
Given the insane amount of duped items this is almost a requirement IMHO.
---
I'm still confused
---
they added a perk to defend against explosive damage. Stop they are fixing both issues..
---
&gt;how about they also don’t share the same cap stash....
---
&gt;if I buy something worth 50 caps... put 50 caps back into the vendor... not 13.... bullshit 
---
These two things would break the economy in a heartbeat.
---
Though I do agree the cap limit in vendors should be removed.
---
I also feel like they should gain more caps the longer you play.
---
Like 1 hour in-game (1 minute IRL) is 1 one cap. 
---
Also Bethesda give better descriptions for what we’re buying. You buy a scout armor mod and you literally have no idea if it’s for the torso, legs or something else. So many more things....
---
No, no, just when equipped. I'm fairly certain it's because the "Targeting Hud" buff also applies to people around you. So they can see the red highlighted enemies too.
---
It's going to be in the "Walls" tab
---
I'm quite curious when enough is gonna be enough.  This seems like a line drawn in the sand for me.
---
the explosive is being fixed with the fire proof perk. it will reduce explosive damage too. didn't you read that?
---
https://coub.com/view/1m7ip2
---
&gt;these are just principles of any MMO
---
This game isn't an MMO. 
---
Even if it was, many MMOs don't have items that are character bound. For example, EVE Online (2003) has an entirely player driven economy, nothing is character bound. Another example, Elder Scrolls Online (2014), some items are *account bound*, but none are character bound. Which is what OP is asking for - the ability to move items between our own characters. So even within MMO world, there's many games that do NOT bind items to the character. So no, this is absolutely NOT the "principle of any MMO". 
---
&gt; Ohhhhh oohhhhh ohhhhh ohhhh ohhhh
---
I read that and heard [this](https://youtu.be/tbIEwIwYz-c?t=75) in my head. Then I spend 10 minutes googling "oh oh oh oh oh song" which is a really freakin' vague thing to search for. It took me a while but I found the damn thing!
---
This was the most boring quest I've ever done.
---
A large part of why I want a restart
---
Well, if it's true about the full explosive damage on shotguns counting per-pellet, then that might explain the difference. I don't have an explosive shotgun to test.
---
I would been just happier for them to focus on the bobblehead bug and split the TSE effects so they can't exist on the same weapon.
---
Bobblehead fix sorts out the E. May still need nerfs after the fact but this just seems like a lazy knee-jerk reaction without consideration of the consequences.
---
Well, that is unless they have data that TS and E separately are also OP. It's not something the community complains about though.
---
PC, and yes I did have a workshop....you seriously loose caps being a pacifist owning a workshop?  Bethesda, really?
---
Uh no its like a literal campground w tents and stuff
---
Yep. Powered doors are too I think. 
---
This is why I play. It just feels nice watching noobs go berserk when you drop stims, food, and water on them. They really appreciate radaway at that level 2.
---
You totally wouldnt enjoy this vanilla private server i play on haha, Project Ascension, its a classless server where you pick spells and talents from all vanilla classes to make your own class. Its got free for all pvp after level 20, can kill your own faction, capital cities and inns being only safe zones. Heres why you wouldnt like it: killing someone within 5 levels of you allows you to loot them for up to 2 pieces of random gear, and a few things from their bags. But only 60s can loot 60s
---
They are literally nerfing the last fun aspect of this game imo. End games boring, bullet sponges get old and the pvp / building is a joke. At least walking around with an explosive shotgun added a little bit of fun and banter (mind you I've never had a TSE, just the standard explosive, and it was legit too).
---
Guess it's time to uninstall for a bit. I really hope they improve the game because at the moment it's a boring lackluster mess.
---
As a side note, because the one up north is unmarked it is a fantastic place to build a camp
---
[I go oooh oooh, you go ahh ahh, la la la la, la la la la.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykW4rtW2eu0)
---
Also, why are people convinced that im a duper? Im here to get support and maybe some thoughts from the Fallout community and maybe find others that are going through the same.
---
So far people have just been negative and trying to actually frame me as a duper! What the actual hell.
---
Not only that the game is broken, so is the community? Are you people mad? We are supposed to stand up for each other, not hate on each other.
---
No wonder people dont want to talk about issues when this is the aftermath. Geeze!
---
People complaining about nerfs and claiming the devs play a class that isnt getting nerfed.....  
---
FO76 is a real mmorpg after all.....
---
To quote a wise man:
---
It’s ok. Lrn2play.
---
Seriously. It’ll be ok. You had a crutch. An easy mode. Training wheels. They’re coming off soon and well, there’s ways to deal. Trust me, I’m not trolling you. Balance sucks sometimes if you get sideswiped by it. But the alternative is worse. And try and remember: all developers balance their games. This has happened many times in many places in a lot of the same ways.
---
Just don’t get caught up in trying to chase the OP trends. You’ll get caught in a cycle of always using the thing that gets nerfed.
---
Probably had a pile of bobbleheads. 
---
They use stealth bugs, welcome to fallout 76.
---
The community for Xbox one doesn’t seem toxic at all. I’ve seen a few trolls but they prefer baiting people rather than full harassment. 
---
If you are with a high level player and you guys are moving around you’ll be fine. If you dwell to long in one place you might get some... “overzealous players” that will probably attack you thinking your a duper. 
---
I don’t know why developers go down the nerf route. Why not just buff the other weapons to bring them in line with the stronger weapons? 
---
Wouldn’t be surprised if they add some weapon damage buffs in the atomic store, that’s the kind of company they’ve become.
---
Yeah, powered doors are at the bottom on walls tab
---
That's the point of being wanted
---
That's my whole point, I agree two shot and explosive needed nerfing, but they are going too far in my opinion, I've been trying to tell everyone I can about my build because I've been called a hacker, and I've seen others calling others hackers as well. People are ignorant. It isn't an insult it just means they don't know. Melee needs to be nerfed, so does bloodied and adrenal reaction, as well as sentinel assassin and cavalier armors. Also dense and fireproof need nerfed, there should NOT be 100% damage reduction to anything in my opinion.
---
So what if i trade with someone and get 5k or more rounds or take a pile of stuff from your stash all at once? I trade, drop, and receive thousands of rounds all the time.... am i going to be banned then?
---
Please noobs send high level ppl a message when you need help. We have literally nothing else to do, and if we do, it's just boring server hopping or sbq 
---
Even with perks explosive are by far the heaviest.
---
&gt; Separate issue. There's already a million posts about the inside vault this week and nerfing TSE. Soooo also take a look and make sure you're not double posting. I think I just counted at least 4 posts which were all for the same reason. 
---
That should be the jobs of the moderators, not the commenters. Don't Bethesda the mod's responsibilities. They should be on top of this shit.
---
Two simple fixes:
---
1). Stop breaking the law
---
2) Don’t join events if you’re a criminal. 
---
[this is in jest, it seriously needs fixed]
---
Making the cryptids more "strange" would spice up the game. Maybe not make some spawn as much to keep the air of mystery.
---
It does more damage to scorch beast and scorched
---
Some people are just ass holes for no reason 
---
If you fight a melee person, you win depending on your perks and defense, but for the TSE weapons, even with all the defense perks and 250 defense already, you'll still die to the TSE shotgun. Btw that's not an exaggeration I've actually tried that. Melee IS overpowered but it's stoppable unlike most TSE weapons what sets them apart is that a melee requires a build, while TSE just needs Rifleman, Gunslinger, or Shotgunner and there goes everyone. That's why they haven't nerfed the melee despite it's power
---
Nothing. You’re perfect. 
---
Out of the problems with the Wanted system, this isn't one of them.
---
You're joining a public event while running around with a bounty.  What are you honestly expecting.
---
It would be cool if we had a mode similar to rust, were if you die, you lose all your stuff.
---
the PC community mostly just either ignore each other or we give each other free stuff, don't ask me why its just how it works.
---
Thanks for the tip. Ill have to trynit out.
---
Yeah ammo crafting is big for anyone I think, but especially for crossbow and shotguns. Crossbow because you won't get the ammo from most anywhere else, shotgun because you'll burn through white a bit of it in a small time frame. The Ammosmith perk is definitely worth investing in for both ranks. 
---
[https://youtu.be/YbseBW-AWn4?t=70](https://youtu.be/YbseBW-AWn4?t=70)
---
He didn't drop you any coffee did he? Lol
---
It's well documented from very early on, even before launch, that workshops are PvP areas when they're being contested.
---
The game is working as intended.
---
I know this is a month old, but for anyone looking for this, the tent itself seems to be a random spawn, the first time I went there no tent was in front of the red rocket station, but there was one located across the street to the north, server hopped a couple times and had scorched spawn near the station and a tent was right out front next to them, had trapper arms, server hopped a few more times and no tent in front of the station. 
---
Not sure how I'm supposed to change the video card on my xbox....
---
It’s crops
---
I’m sure they don’t use water from a stream unfiltered 
---
Thank you.  I got the metal building too and missed it on several passes.  
---
Agreed. Hopefully they put in player vending machines so you can go adventure and let the machines handle the transactions. Solid idea!
---
I wish turrets didnt take up so much budget lol. Great base btw
---
Ok, lol, that actually is what I was remembering! Good ol' Al, shoulda never got rid of the mustache.
---
mostly yes
---
Even when I'm not in them though?  It seemed like an excessive amount of caps to be loosing too.  And the fact they're not on the map and had no GT?
---
A month of farming caps to buy 12 different TSE guns just got wasted. 
---
Back to Smite I guess.
---
Never happened to me personally, but I wouldn't doubt it. The sad truth :(
---
I agree with all of these.
---
That's awesome! How did you get around the build limit?
---
Looks great.
---
I've only killed one player. I was lvl 50, they were 12, I fast travelled home to find them destroying my C.A.M.P. I unfortunately had to deal with it.
---
Now just make it so that the bobble heads don’t stack such that you can be one shot in x-01 while in pacifist.  
---
Allow people within 5m of their bag to call their bag to then.
---
That's actually pretty nice. Good Job!
---
Here Here friend i agree just because a load of people complained about tse's now the whole gun system is taking a hit as there was more important fixes needed to other weapon types to make them viable end game and even mid game viable guns.
---
Getting a headset and making tons of friends is fun. You can get a cheap one for like $20. I made tons of friends at about level 20-30 and now were all level 100+
---
Kinda like comunisim, eh comrade?
---
It does a TSE harpoon still 1 shots me in real world PvP tests lol. 3 star fireproof plus basic marine dense chest piece is not enough.  
---
Maybe dense in all pieces plus sentinel assasins to try to guarantee at least a 1 shot tank ability as that is usually enough 
---
I thought that at first, but don't nuka colas have rads?
---
Some of these ideas are crazy but overall I like them and want them added
---
Maybe, I dont even know :S
---
I’m down for playing whenever GT aleeycat
---
I honestly don't care about it. But I bet a lot of people do. I bet a lot of people are going to be actually raging. Most have no idea. They are just playing the game. Most don't read reddit. They don't read forums. But when it goes live then the floodgates will open.
---
Melee will be next, basically anything that can kill things in one shot will get nerfed down to 3 or 4 shots. 
---
I have a feeling that whatever went wrong didn't happen at a studio level, more of a publishing level.
---
Yeah even though blueprints exist it's still pretty frustrating none the less
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer 
---
u/LadyDevann 
---
u/jessbethesda

u/Bethesdagamestudios_
---
Lol
---
Thank you for the respones but I still don't understand
---
I had to take down a ton of decor :( budget is maxed out XD
---
I really like a lot of these. Suggested enemy rebalancing, especially scarier deathclaws, yes. Refrigerators would be nice. Bobbleheads...yes. 
---
I’d like to add fix the damn flamer fuel consumption, unless you have it already and I missed it.
---
You picked up one bag of 4k shells to get your ban? It's pretty obvious you're full of shit. Good riddance.
---
While I do appreciate your post regarding the multiplicative defence values of said armors, I must disagree on your proposed solution however. 
---
I feel that making it no longer add up would make alot of armors and such effectively "dead loot" as in you can't even benefit from it if you wanted to. I think a more reasonable approach would be to simply lower the percentages of the effect to begin with. Something like 5% for sentinel and cavalier and maybe like 2% on assassin's. That way the armor set would still be a good option, if not still the best, but wouldn't be capable of the 100% damage avoidance with sentinel + assassin + dodgy.
---
Hmm. I’ll have to keep looking around then. The only unmarked area south of there I found was that camp. It has tents and all tho so I was curious if that was it. 
---
Get fireproof in your deck, and stay out of power armor for pvp. The sods will wreck your shit big time and leave you with a farming list as long as your arm. The best tonic for arseholes with tse is a nice melee vats crit. If you can get close enough, via the magical vats teleportation method, you can completely negate their advantage as their own splash damage will kill them. But yeah that bs with workshops needs to be sorted, its obvious from your statement that you didnt want any of it and the guy/girl was just being a turd
---
Np, glad to help :)
---
Honestly I don't know for sure but I think your safe. I picked up things that they saw and said "no way you have 25 of each pure flux, shotgun shells, or that many plans," to which I say I honestly found them. They were in  sack by a shack on the south Eastern side of whitesprings.  
---
In the area, yes. Not in the area, you shouldn't be affected unless maybe for some reason the combat carried over or you sought revenge or something. MAYBE it's a bug if outside but within, certainly as expected.
---
Not on the map/no GT is probably because they're sneaking. That's not hacking or bug.
---
I can confirm I got one from turning in Technical Data. Good luck! Be aware your hands clip through the gloves. Might just be one female characters, I’m not sure.
---
The way I see it, Bethesda just sees other developers, like the guy who did Fortnite Battle Royale, making billions of dollars. But Bethesda also has no idea what actually makes the game like that work, not to mention lack the skill and the know-how to make something like it. But they want a piece of that pie, regardless. Ergo, the new "no rules" PvP mode.
---
Personally, I don't mind it. I think their time could have been better spent on content and improvements to the game that *all players can enjoy*, both PvE and PvP. But if they want a PvP mode, let them. Currently PvP is so broken for a number of reasons that I won't be participating regardless, so this mode is a non-issue for me.
---
Should co-op and pacifist players have their own mode? Yes. Again, plenty of examples to support this. Best one is Ultima Online, released in '97. It was really struggling as FFA PvP ruleset. Until they released Trammel, a consensual PvP only ruleset. Basically PvE/Co-Op shard. And the game started to grow! Amazing, right? In fact, by 2003, the previously failing UO became the biggest MMO. Until being annihilated by WoW's success. Which, drumroll please, also had consensual PvP, not FFA. So putting no-rules FFA PvP in FO76 is just dumb. 
---
"and you deal 3k damage! And you deal 3k damage! Everybody deals 3k damage!"
---
Go down that route and they would just buff enemies to have 10k health. 
---
No change, they are still killing two shot and explosive.
---
Thank u !
---
Here umm lemme see if i can find it on the map gimmie a sec
---
That's like 12+ hours every single day since launch to get that many hours in. I ain't judging, hell I wish I had that much free time, but damn.
---
Thank u !!
---
I'm not saying it didn't need to be addressed, but dropping BOTH legendary prefixes by 75% seems a *little* extreme 
---
Saaaame omg lol. And ty!!
---
Pacifist should negate damage from other players too. What's the point from abstaining from pvp if people can still kill you
---
It was purely because I caught him. Otherwise I wouldn't have cared. 
---
Dang
---
&gt;Which events do you feel are most rewarding to you?
---
Scorchbeast Queen since it drops plans and stable fluxes. But also the rewards that give plans or spawn level 50 3 star legendary for a great drop. I moved my camp to cranberry bog just to be able to get to some events with higher level gear rather than farming whitespring. 
---
&gt;Which events do you not care about doing or dislike? Why?
---
Watoga dropped connection. Primarily because of the requirement to reach the top of the buildings. Missing some jumps means running back to the other side of the city or going through a couple of load screens to reach the roof lol. 
---
&gt;Which events do you prefer to play in a team vs. solo? Why?
---
Teams - missile silos and scorchbeast Queen. The rest are so easy to solo. 
---
&gt;What types of events would you like to see in the game?
---
More intense events. Like an event you wouldn't want to try to solo. Somewhere between scorchbeast Queen and it's a trap. Would really like to see unique monsters from nuking other fissure sites. Prime is nice but can we get some variety? I'd say every event in the game can be done solo except the scorched Earth event. 
---
&gt;How do you join events? Do you fast travel? Do you go to a location expecting to start an event?
---
So I found fast traveling to be the best. I do sometimes walk into them. But occasionally I jog over to one and it pings saying I'm entering the event, but it doesn't update on my tracked quest log. Since I don't have any updates it doesn't tell me what's going on next or give me waypoints. I have to fast travel to it to activate the quest again. But if I'm already there I have to run away from it just to fast travel otherwise I'm too close to fast travel. 
---
&gt;How would you feel about bonuses for completing a daily or weekly event?
---
Like the challenges? Atoms are okay. But with the budget so small in the camps, you really can't have all the nice stuff on display. So bonuses like a legendary item rewarded for completing daily events with the option to trade that in for a reroll on the same item but different legendary stats. Probably cost some caps for that, but 99% of legendary items I leave unlooted because with their weights vs caps gained, not even worth picking them up. Being able to hit a vendor worth a legendary item and exchange it for a chance to reroll legendary stats would be an excellent bonus. Well worth a week long grind of events. 
---
Thanks for listening :-)
---
If it shouldn’t be in the game I don’t really care. It’ll get nerfed eventually either way. This is like dupe lite lol
---
Officially, mods are "not supported", but I think that means Bethesda is not going to help you if a mod messes up your game.
---
What kind of headset do you recommend? The rig I have rn is kinda iffy
---
From the moment they attack the workshop, you are marked as an enemy for a set amount of time, regardless of where you are. 
---
As enemies, you no longer appear on each other's maps.
---
However, they probably already noted where you were before attacking.
---
Dude, that is freakin' awesome. I abstemiously love stumbling across C.A.M.P. builds that are really over the top. 
---
You just gotta do the heart emote and you should be good!
---
10:43 EST - Something's wrong with Flatwoods at the moment. A number of objects haven't appeared, including work-benches and tables, particularly in the church. Lots of items are floating. Everything else in the area appears normal, including the Farm-hand Event. I've gone away and come back but nothing's fixed.
---
So tell, is it true that sugar prevents concrete from setting?
---
As opposed to doing 50 damage to everything with any weapon and keeping bullet sponges as they are? Perfect.
---
If you want someone to kill your pet they can’t do so when in a team with you, I had to put down my buddy’s mirelurk king today.
---
R.I.P Reuben
---
You Right. Two-Shot and Explosive should not be available on the same weapon! Fact!
---
This just seems like a no brainer to me. 
---
For example a wall mounted gun rack with variations of different guns.
---
Hell just a fridge with some food in it would be cool.
---
I would be VERY surprised if this was a bannable offence.
---
It doesn't give you any real advantage over another player. It just potentially saves you on wasted credits. That's about it.
---
They may not support bugs that affect you that come out of the bug but aside from that, I wouldn't worry.
---
If an official word comes out saying it IS bannable, there's going to be push back for the very reason listed above.
---
Tbh i assumed it would be new characters. They're calling it a new game mode,  why would you have 1 character that can play 2 different modes? 
---
*initiates slow clap*
---
Hell no to the toilet paper
---
I'd love to do t hat, but then my game crashes and all they know is I just vanished.
---
I was having a lot of issues yesterday, 2 drops in about an hour and for the longest "stable" time the server delay was terrible.  I should note I haven't really had many connection issues since launch either. Just since the last patch it seems. Also on PC.
---
I assume the Bomber Jacket comes from turning in Technical Data, yeah?
---
Indeed my friend just want to protect the modding community and make sure none of us on pc are banned for qol mods like this.
---
Thanks so much!!
---
....want my god damn tesla to viable again....its great early on for a little while but I want the damn thing back to its electric arcing blob of death lobbing puff of destruction self :(
---
Ur welcome. To bad people cant move in
---
what new pvp servers? between this and the TSE nerf posts are people guessing at updates or did i miss something?
---
I can understand the nerf to explosive, but why hurt 2-shot like that?  The accuracy penalty is bad enough.
---
Tbh tho it actually seems like a good idea but, the drop rates would have to be insanely low and only on very hard-to-farm endgame creatures. 
---
Otherwise there would be people who would run around with no possibility of getting a diesease even tho I dont really know what they do because half of them barely do anything but +food/ water loss
---
And maybe after they fix duping aswell. Otherwise, we would have hundreds in the first day after the patch which would ruin them like they ruined TSE weapons.
---
Unless there is a new otherwise unreported action, the bans/emails went out to PC users that had items that were from the developers room.  If your on PC and the bag had items that are from developers room (accessible by a teleportation hack in a cheat engine) this seems reasonable.  Otherwise you are first person to report this happening to them.
---
I used the shotgun shells as an example. I'm sorry I didn't list everything in my stash for you but Bethesda knows what was in my inventory and stash, So be clear I'm simply warning other people to stay away. So obviously I'll accept their decision to lift my ban (obviously got no choice there) but I'm also gonna give a heads up to people so they don't have to deal with this headache. 
---
I would go to anti armor explosive but TSE will still be a very strong power but basically nothing when compared to now
---
They weren't sneaking, unless you can maintain that while jumping instead of running to maneuver.  Besides aren't consecutive kills against a pacifist supposed to result in less damage output by the attacking player?  If simply owning a camp puts you into a pvp mode while you have pacifist on doesn't that just make you a helpless target?  Not much time to turn it on while being one-hit by a lv20 shotgun...
---
Differently, jackass. 
---
I updated the post so its up above 
---
Id really like to see events have rewards scaled to your level.
---
Video
---
I would still want there to somehow be a bounty system on the pvp servers, i love having myself marked and for everyone to come for me. Get to make cool trap houses or get somewhere hard to get and then have the monsters around me respawn and watch players deal with traps/monsters and me
---
One of the cheap ones from Wal-Mart are fine if you're broke AF a $10 one works really well but there is a $20 one on Amazon that works beautifully
---
I believe so yes
---
That’s close to that US camp thing. I’ll check that area. Thank ya. 
---
I agree with this to a certain extent. But there was so many of them. I know from my stand point if I didn't see someone else I would just post it. But, if I continued to browse and saw someone else posted it, I would take mine down. I know the mods are there but, they have jobs as well. Help em out. Community effort.
---
You don’t take slap damage in pacifist mode. I reread the post 4 times to make sure I was seeing it correctly and I can’t for the life of me understand how your sentiment is shared so heavily. The second you turn on pacifist you never have to deal with pvp unless you take a workshop which doesn’t matter because they’re awful anyway. Pacifist is a no pvp mode so I don’t really understand your post. Are you asking that other players on the server shouldn’t be able to pvp because you don’t like it?
---
Going back to slap damage I don’t see how people are complaining about that either. It would take someone almost 5 minutes to kill someone with slap damage from full health. You can literally out heal slap damage passively. You can fast travel away. You can change servers. Running into someone who tries to do slap damage probably isn’t even common anyway.
---
I enjoyed the game for a bit but after awhile the pve gets stale. The pvp is already not fun and hard to come by. I’m really trying to see it from your perspective but it seems like a weird complaint and you have plenty of solutions for it already in place. Feel free to down vote if you want but I don’t think the change you’re asking for is necessary.
---
The only change they should’ve made to cater to what you’re asking is they should’ve had server browsers with different settings on each.
---
They need to change that "drop" button to a "throw away" button since that is likely what would happen anyway. Personally I don't drop anything unless I want to throw it out, I don't know what all you wacky kids are doing dropping your prized possessions on the ground like a bunch of squirrels.
---
I love this, Beth, please make this happen
---
Yes I found if you let it snap then strafe until it breaks off it'll then be in a good space. I prefer that look anyway. Otherwise they looked to cluttered. It may be me but I also wish they were a lot more visible from a distance. 
---
My whole hope was to create a billboard to lure in travelers. The letters fade too quickly I've found
---
[Poor Jangles](https://imgur.com/c6KhHtG)
---
Psn mjesticbattlecat add me tomorrow and i can mod your weapon if you wish. Might need to farm some materials but ill do the mod for free
---
And to clarify I’m not pissing and moaning about the nerf they needed to do that. 
---
I’m just wondering if there are any other avenues that will open up for “different builds”
---
I'm on ps4, and I even told a noob who was asking people how to do it, not to. 
---
My build is a command with melee. Its my fav build from the series. You can just go in guns blazing then melee for super close quarters and to save ammo.
---
I also really liked that in 76 you can spec heavy weapons with the same build and swap melee pit for it. I've just been waiting on them to address heavy weapons before dumping my points. Particularly the plasma Gatling breaking in one core and the flamer having no ammo. Also people said minigun and laser Gatling do almost no dmg. So I am holding out in hopes of getting some fixes.
---
Does it have a perk requirement like armorer or science etc
---
Yes, you can jump and sneak.
---
&gt; Besides aren't consecutive kills against a pacifist supposed to result in less damage output by the attacking player? 
---
No, it's consecutive deaths. More specifically, if you have no caps to front your bounty for. That's when you get the debuff.
---
Vengeful Mothmen attack.  The normal Mothman tends to fly away when you get close.
---
Ah I understand, it's one of those " fuck yo couch" kinda scenarios
---
While your making it happen by doing it. Could you also sort food into stat bonus so that happens too?
---
I lost a heap of flux in the ams building turns out 8 explosive turrets will shred me... I kinda want them for my camp
---
As far as I can see it doesnt? But maybe its bugged and it should? I checked the wiki and it doesnt mention it 
---
Try a power armor heavy gun 15 endurance build I drop people so fast with a 50 cal 74 damage per shot 45% armor ignore with bullet shield you'll always out dps melee guys
---
What enemies are bullet sponges other than the queen, behemoths? Some times I feel like I must be playing a different game because I just don't run into this stuff with my non-legendary rifle.
---
two shot is just as broken why do you get 100% damage and an additional projectile even with the nerf its still one of the better prefixes
---
The game is already on the easy side...I tend to ignore most suggestions as stuff that won't happen regardless. I see it in more games than just this one. 
---
Personally I'm just chilling waiting for new content that will get me to log in again. It got boring 1-2 shotting everything but that happens to me in every bethesda game. 
---
&gt;The rules of PvP as they currently are in the game are not changing outside of the new mode.
---
Somehow you keep... missing... the... mark... 
---
Can we nerf stash box capacity while were at it? 600 is way too much. I'm thinking maybe 100? 600 is too fun and easy going. 100 would make me uninstall the game so that sounds perfect
---
It's a bug now where even though you have the required materials it won't let you build them
---
Read the plan under the notes tab
---
There was a bug for the items not showing the proper amounts. This could be something they missed, try adding another flux or two
---
At this point (level 100+) I ignore vats's existence because its so broke. The HUD for it flashes on/off for minutes and lags my game but it does drain it very quick like the jetpack
---
Cocaine it’s a hell of a drug
---
I don't have a problem with the explosive mod. It's really upped my sniper tremendously. I dumped my sniper character for melee meta with all rise. Literally bop everything on the head pulling 1000+ damage on a regular attack. I can kill a 50 scorchbeast in 2-3 power swings. 
---
Before the tse for my sniper i couldn't even fight them. I'd suit up in power armor and burn through 500 rounds or more just to get the thing to land so I can shoot it some more. 
---
The tse helped balance the scorchbeast spamming attacks and swoops outside the melee PA meta. 
---
Saw the.mod was obviously bummed when I saw it wasn't a standard mod. 
---
Isn't that feature coming at the end of the month? Or was it just the availability of plans in general
---
Boutta nuke whitesprings too. I'll give it a try and see what I get 
---
« It just works »

                                         -Godd Howard
---
They should just take wood armor out of the game, period.  I've never used it.  Ever.
---
either put all the mats in your stash or relog i have heard of both working it seems like a new bug
---
They mention SB traps in the Free States questline but I couldn't find any of the details about them on the terminals. And I haven't had all those scorched detectors notify me of a goddamn thing.
---
4!
---
Yeah we tried both in a team and not in a team, we weren't sure though if us being Friends affected it though.
---
No i am one of the people that are right here with you. I am sorry but accusing someone of exploiting the duplication just because they have to many items is just stupid. I am sorry but after 400+ hours of playing I acquired a metric ton of crap just because i have a hard time of getting rid of stuff.. Just like any other fallout game i never pass up anything.. so because we gathered to much, crafted to much so we may learn modifications, or came across that bag that had a fuck ton of crap in it we are being banned.. The dam exploit for duplication now is ruining the game for some of us hoarders and it seems we are the ones paying for it while most of the duping people still are getting to play the game.. They dont realize the items have been duped, passed to just about everyone in the game, and the real solution is new DLC to replace the items that have been duped and passed around.. make them obsolete and to were people have better to find.. There is no way for them to track the duping correctly so why are innocent people losing out on a game we all bought and ATOMS we purchased
---
Not 100% sure its why this is important for them to answer. We are stuck waiting to know yay or nay.
---
Also not sure have not seen anything regarding it.
---
Is that what it does? I just looked at it and it does add a lot of resistance to the bit I bought, but I never noticed anything about heavy.  
---
Great idea👍
---
I'm not against people self-policing but compared to subs for other game I've followed, these mods are VERY hands off. 
---
Not very proactive either. You'd think a sensible pinned post would be one to funnel all the event feedback introduced with the latest Inside the Vault. As you can see, nothing. Not even an attempt to funnel people to the first major post on events that's gotten some traction.
---
Yes you could say that there are so many posts but other subs manage just fine. If they can, so can this mod team.
---
[This observation was posted literally 2 hours before your post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ah0j0m/i_think_the_problem_is_the_explosive_mod_not_the/?st=JR1IV5VU&amp;sh=df69db3e) 
---
Fair enough but you never. They never clarified that point so I would hope so 
---
Not too sure it might have been if you guys were previously in a team on the server? I think I relogged into the server when I had to put him down so it counted me as a new player to the server
---
This bug is horrid
---
Just the part where you mentioned that they punish people with only one of the two and that they ignore that, but generally 1/2 is less than 2/2
---
Yeah, I understand, it's just unfortunate that it feeds the narrative of "Bethesda doesn't care".
---
They are most likely not going to answer you, as this would open the flood gates to other potential "safe" dlls and whether or not modding is actually supported. Most companies stay silent (turn a blind eye so to say) when it comes to unofficial modding, that way they can do what needs to be done if required.
---
Shit, uh, that one workshop on the west side of the map has all those quonsets where you can plant food. I assumed that is what the food thing was although that doesn't really apply anywhere else. Is it suppose to be like food and water is generated faster at workshops with higher numbers? 
---
Pull out a Fatman with maxed explosives perk, last laugh and either strike beacon or nuke grenades. You die they die, anyone else near you also dies. 
---
Dawww, poor lil guy
---
I'm interested... any kind you recommend wether it be from Walmart or Amazon
---
I believe I’ve seen it being sold on my first day playing the BETA at harpers ferry but I’ve never seen it since so maybe not, it was also in the beta so it might’ve gotten sealed for some reason
---
One of the missions you have to steal codes if I remember right?
---
Work hard for random heavy combat armour drops. Then have the plans to turn them to BOS, which come from vendors in Grafton.
---
They will still be viable just not as dumb as they are now still dont aee why ts is being screwed with for the most part. And personally been looking for a freaking furious mini with reduced weight -_- bout to give up go back to a rifle build.
---
I'm still logging in and doing mindless stuff. I'm basically waiting for the new content as well.
---
Everyone using melee again now, melee one shots enemies easily. Boring game is about to become even more boring.
---
Wow...she's straight trash, he could have done better 
---
Point being they were not crouched. But from what TTSSJJfo is saying that makes more sense.  So i guess the lesson is don't own workshops.  How about those private servers Bethesda...
---
Just let me build in existing structures
---
 I don't get why we can't. If I could build in Harper's ferry city center I could check off a few of those boxes. 
---
Just section off quest areas or let us have them where we can't interfere with events 
---
If you're on Xbox, I'll pay you $25 for that disc. That's a good price for a used, shitty broken game, right?
---
Screw that...
---
Bethesda, pay the guy that made that mod and just add it to the game already. This is day one stuff here, should already have been in the game. Get yo shit together, gawd!
---
Fair enough. Agreed.
---
You don’t? I have my camp set up in a house. I have those traps set up on every staircase and I walk right up without taking damage. 
---
The other second-star abilities aren't that great either, so explosive may still be the most effective for heavy weapons. Two-shot sounds bad post-nerf except at very close range but it should still multiply with explosive, unlike anti-armor. Bloodied would be better though, until they nerf that too. Furious may be best if you prefer to keep your hp topped up.
---
I’d like pvp servers to work like this, everyone’s character is set to level 5 and they are stripped of perk cards and they are given basic weapons like assault rifles or 10mm, I think stuff like that would keep pvp servers fair so that there’s no low level players with pipe weapons facing level 200 dudes and their TSE handmades
---
He said he saw the shells and picked up the bag. Obviously there was something else in the bag  
---
This has been going on for days. 
---
I agree with this though incisor probably needs a nerf 75% is a bit high
---
Rifleman applies? The G-rifle is technically an automatic weapon, just not a *fully* automatic one. Does the game only differentiate the "automatic" subtype in the weapon name? 
---
BRO!!! The death claw thing! You nailed all of this. Sick ideas 👏🏼👊🏼
---
Two questions: How do you get that paint, and what are ads? (I'm guessing they are the summons of the queen?)
---
just relog a few times it will work or make sure mats are in your stash not on you
---
That being said, I havent seen all of those things there (maybe one, but never all of them at once)
---
It's a rare event drop. You can get it from Fertile Soil I've heard.
---
Do you make the lining or do you add it to the suit as a mod?
---
I think that you should be able to arrange both your s.p.e.c.i.a.l. and perk cards as you much as you want and whenever you like after completing the "I am Death"/reaching End game.
---
This.  Why is pacifist mode still allowing you to take chip damage?  Pacifist mode should just make it so your not flagged for pvp and none of this would be happening.  Hackers and dupers will still pop everything and wreck you even with the tse nerf.  They may just have to spend more ammo because the chip damage is still there.  Tse is not a pvp problem.  The games flawed anti pvp mechanic is.  Anyone who takes pvp in this game seriously needs to look elsewhere to better pvp games.
---
It's nice to know that you're out there, thinking about me.
---
Same thing happened to me. Found a fix around mines. My quest line objective and quest marker for the one I needed to complete was not appearing! I remembered I was at Charleston and had to find the last key fragment but didn’t know how. I watched a walkthrough on YouTube making sure I didn’t miss any steps and continued where I had left off. 
---
Seems crazy to nerf them if they are suggesting that pvp is going to the servers. Don’t have an explosive weapon myself, so can’t judge their damage.
---
Why u no mutate bro?
---
Wait, explosive gives a 100% damage increase? I always thought it was a constant increase of about 30 per pellet. No wonder they are so broken.
---
Well in my experience the rendering distance for lights is much smaller than for structures. 
---
Also, you can try stacking the neon lights. That will increase the brightness. But it may be tricky to get them to align over each other.  In Fallout 4 this trick worked really well.  
---
As long as the vendors pop on the map or a list somehow. Many of us have our camps in remote locations in order to use resource nodes.  There’d be little traffic to any camp not placed near common fast travel points. 
---
I think having that much is a little over the top (though not against it in principle) but I'd at the very least like a home and a camp i.e. something larger and more established and something smaller and mobile where I can maybe cook some food and re-up the sleep and tuned bonuses.
---
It sucks having to choose between one or the other sometimes.
---
Have the smaller of the two with a tiny budget so the most you can have is like 1 crafting station or a limited stations that let you do minimal things.
---
Go to your stash, let it “load”, dump your junk. 
---
Bengoo G9000 is the one im using from Amazon. Ita decent but has an annoying USB cord on it for the lights on it. Overall pretty good.
---
I'm not a game dev, but considering that there is a [mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/214) for this (the creator even explained how they made it work) and that it seems to be reliable for me so far i really have no idea why Bethesda didn't do anything similar already
---
Add as a Mod
---
I have a nocturnal 40% power attack axe thats weight reduced, that I throw on when the stars are at.....it one shots everything dam near....its quite useful and fun just carry other weapons as well.
---
We're they actually nerfed? I don't see why not. I'm tired of killing myself so I stick with regular TS for the most part . Have a quad explosive as a back up. 
---
Thank you!
---
Just dump it.
---
Make humanity a favor and get rid of these TSE abominations!
---
That sounds great, I think part of the problem is people using them in PVP, plus the bobblehead stacking that allows people to shoot through slap damage, but personally I don't really think nerfing them in PVE is the right call, They do need some adjustments for PvP, but with how bullet spongey a lot of the end-game enemies are compared to the power of weapon classes, I think we'll see a lot of issues after this nerf. 
---
Especially sense we cant fucking do anything with the plans except drop them for a new player... I'll be damned if I'm going to keep 300 plans in my stache waiting for some asshat to buy it from the market.
---
Pvp is the lategame. Derp

Hahahahah!

---
People are being banned for picking up stacks of  items created via duping 
---
I meant letting the players put machines in the player hub. Vault 76 would be perfect or maybe top of the world.
---
The only one I know of that has the food resource on the map and actually has a food processor is the farm in the far west part of the map. 
---
Which is a new feature implemented with the patch.
---
Something that I think is dumb and they should not have done.
---
I know more than a few people who would request those just to help out newbies heading through flatwoods (myself included) I swear this is supposed to be a community driven game but it feels like every move Bethesda makes screams every man and woman for themselves.
---
Whether it's this, the feed the people fix (like c'mon you fix that but you still haven't fixed eating people's armor weapons and ammo) and god knows what else. 
---
So... Removing the TSE. The only reason for playing. Why even play anymore.
---
Oh. That would be even better than having them in camp. 
---
So I just now got my bottle, so I'm sure you've seen other reviews of it. Personally, I don't think it's all that bad. Is it worth $80 a bottle? No, you can definitely get better rum for that price. But the bottle is pretty cool and the rum isn't terrible. It's sweeter than any rum I've ever had. All in all, I think I'd give it a 6-7/10. Not great, but it's not as bad as others seem to think.
---
Did you throw away the police sunglasses too? They part of the responders police set and you get them at the same time. 
---
"Baited AND outsmarted"
---
&gt;  I'm not sure why you don't see that, and instead just want to bash PVE players.
---
Because we're not casual players - we're on reddit - where the logical thing to do is use this platform to organize next level gaming. MMO's don't even need a hub because we have forums.
---
Pretty sure every activity you engage in you'll try to make it more analogue using the exact same emotional logic. I blame you for not making a tiny effort to even try PVP with friends.
---
No need. If you have a 5-star card, but only 2 SPECIAL slots left, the card should just be equippable, with 2 out of 5 stars active. Automatically. There's no need for manual de-level, or manual rank-up. Rank-up should be automatic, and de-level dynamic.
---
Thanks for the follow up!
---
I'm completely cool with people visiting my camp.  I built it up so that the open area is a place where you can rest, repair, and work on your equipment in relative peace and the locked area is for me to have a space to myself. 
---
I don't have a problem opening the locked area up when someone visits but I do expect my visitors to behave themselves and not damage my little slice of Appilatchia.
---
Are they called patrolman glasses?
---
When somebody shoots me in RDR I hunt them down for the rest of the game. They become my content. I will ride my horse to the other side of the map chasing them and shoot them when they try to do missions. I was minding my own business and they messed with me for no reason. So now I get to enjoy PvP, while otherwise I will just be minding my own business doing my own thing enjoying the scenery, taking care of my horse, fishing, delivering some messages, etc. Now I'm Elliot Ness and I'm not giving up ever.
---
i'm fine with it being a stash, but I think it should display any magazine stored inside. 
---
Where are the crops then? There weren’t any near the workshop. 
---
I wish it wasn't cause I love Fallout universe but the game is already easy.  Last couple Elder Scrolls and FO games are super easy to the point you have to use mods that boost enemy dmg x10 and reduce yours to .10, just to have a minor difficult time.
---
I leveled a toon to 50 with no melee skills using a board with nails only.  I could take on groups of level 62 scorched at level 15. Game is already easy.  They need to somehow make it harder without artificially bloating health.  They have never figured it out in their other games so I'm not holding my breath.
---
You can solo 99% of the game without any legendary gear or help.  It's that easy.
---
you know a guy with a furious silenced radium rifle and a chameleon armor can kill you right?? he will just remove your hp bar to full red with rad dmg that you cant block any of it. did that to a guy like you holding the ammo factory ....
---
Absolutely! 
---
People think nerfing tse is going to make a difference.  Pacifist mode is still bad.  You have an anti pvp mechanic that still let's you get killed by other people due to stacking bobbleheads that people probably duped.  Tse is not what's wrong with the pvp aspect, it's the pacifist mode itself.  Pacifist mode should block all damage period from other players and then none of this would have happened and peoples feels wouldn't be hurt.
---
I thought melee weapons couldn't have that effect. That's pretty funny.
---
The funniest I ever found was a freezing flamer.
---
Fireproof protects from explosive damage?

Yeah I want some real challenges. Stuff that isn't afraid to whoop your ass and say you ain't good enough to beat this shit yet... Maybe add a boat that takes you to the REAL deathclaw island, but make them way way stronger and as fast as ghouls. 
---
I've found that all my favorite games have shared a similar experience.... They had a hard mode that made me just laugh hysterically at how insane it was when I first tried it, but after getting good at the game I REALLY appreciated having that content... Like expert mode in l4d2, impossible mode in xcom or Dante must die mode in devil may cry. 
---
That's all the fallout experience is missing for me. Something really worthy of being an endgame challenge.... The queen is really fun and engaging but not really difficult... But bosses aren't the best place for difficulty, they get too scripted.... You want fast, strong and fluid enemies... They shouldn't be overly cheap and hit you with unavoidable attacks, but they should give you very small margins of error, punish mistakes severely and have good AI and maneuverability. 
---
That's my 2 cents on it. Make content that players need to get creative to beat. Real challenges. 
---
I don't have a shotty either.  Never been fond of that weap.
---
However the issue here is the dll, if they choose to have any blanket way of determining hacks on the client, it will flag any and all dlls, QOL ones like this, hack ones, any dlls. Now you might say they could do something like a white list of dlls, however whats stopping someone with a hack dll from renaming it to a safe dll, etc. So its not a case of it shouldnt be a bannable offense, it may just not be possible to determine (if they go down this path).
---
What is going into 15 endurance for a heavy build? What are the actual perks you are using (interested to know as a heavy gun build as well)?
---
dense can only go on torso.
---
You da real MVP!
---
But can they increase weapon durability? I already have to repair too often, after patch I will have to repair 3-4x more. Same goes for ammo crafting.
---
Can craft **all** serums
---
250c a pop
---
Be online in about 1.5hrs
---
I think they should make it so that there's more than one type of shotgun shell. We have 3 revolvers using the same ammo, 3 shotguns using the same ammo etc.
---
I really want to play a revolver and shotgun build. lol
---
I love ammosmith, and hope to get that luck perk that means you might craft double.
---
That worked, apparently it was showing me as having 4 cobalt flux, but it was split between my inventories. So it wouldn't let me. Go figure
---
Bloodied build isn't melee only, I do agree melee needs a nerf but its not strength stacking incisor perk is extremely strong
---
I just want a home and a F.O.B., even if the second camp has half the budget, I still want it.
---
I want to build a second CAMP too. I pretty much finished my base, I dont want to build another one because I love this one. But I want to keep building, but only allowed one CAMP, its kinda hard to do.
---
For an alternative to turrets you can place a few barriers down, they also contribute to defence so will attach wildlife to attack the barriers before they attack your camp.

We all float down here
---
So....what did you do to get wanted so much?
---
I have a Radium Rifle too. Seems cool but I haven't played with it much. And to get into the ammo factory if I own it you will have to get wanted. I also have Chameleon. So yeah... gonna be tough trying to see where I am.
---
I accidentally hit someone one time with my axe and lost 130+ gold on the bounty.
---
I like the random drop idea. 
---
That sucks about the decor but I had no doubs what so ever about the limit being maxed lol, I hope when the private servers come out (if they ever do) you can have perminent workshops and a larger C.A.M.P budget.
---
I think we should get the plan for wood armour at the start and work our way up to leather, metal, robot, combat and marine.
---
Damn if that’s true, i need to throw my 5000 shotgun shells by the window...
---
I was saving them for when I would get a nice pump :(
---
I almost wish I was at this point.
---
Soooooo bad. 
---
15 Steel / 15 steel. You lack the resources to craft this....
---
Dammit game, cant you count!!
---
I don’t remember and I not in a position to check but I can tell you they’re black lenses with a gold frame. 
---
Or, you could just refill and play one character for one server and the other for the other.
---
drop tenderizer for serendipity
---
Hopefully a prominent YouTuber will make a video about these issues and not just make a video based on patch notes without actually been a serious player. So many you tubers out there who are just after the views and listening to there own voices.
---
Should be 20hrs?
---
All of you are
---
Sure just not weekly lol
---
It was either on a desk or on one of the examining tables, but out in the open. From what I read it’s not there all the time. 
---
Idk with the nerfs sbq seems like a waste of time 
---
neither nerf makes sense.  fun is being murdered.
---
Maybe they're telling you something 
---
Other big issue is the bobble head stacking .... that needs to be removed but then I a;so worry the queen will never be killed now lmao 
---
I'm only aware of the Patrolman Sunglasses and the Sunglass, both of which are pretty easy to find in the world
---
I might actually even have a double I’ll check for you. 
---
I have seen one when walking out in the middle of nowhere, just staring at me.  I shot at it once, and it whooshed away.  I still don't know if I was supposed to shoot at it or not.  
---
Yes this happened like 5 min after a nuke was unleashed 
---
If youre on xbox I got all the BOS mods, heavy chest and legs, but im missing arms :(
---
Those Suiciders barely do damage. I just kill them with my melee weapon just like any super mutants.
---
Sell it.
---
Its already OP that's why they nerfed the heavy weps perk to only nonexplosive
---
I have about 100 hours on the game and my guy is level 52. I get sick at the thought of starting over again. I dont know how you guys have multiple characters
---
I imagine instigating on that weapon isn't so good. But the explosive part will be pretty good with demo expert and SMG damage perks, until they nerf the crap out of the explosive part Soon**™**.
---
I think they're planning on using it for some kind of DLC. Don't quote me on that though
---
Also capture workshops. You will get a plan for capture, and within 5 minutes you will defend the workshop and get a second plan. This and events are the best methods. 
---
I'm not a huge fan of what they're doing with TSE. They needed a nerf, I agree. But it would have been better if Two-Shot and Explosive were mutually exclusive. Nerfing them individually, but allowing them to stack still, just destroys them individually. But it will continue to be very strong as a combination.

Other accepted items for currency include:

---
The lmg is OP? I don't run heavy weapons, I'm a rifleman, so I have no idea if this is decent. 
---
But at least let us respec without leveling though. Each time this kind of changes need build to be respec to other form to compensate. But the system right now need us to level up in order to respec OR Perks cards, make it even harder to respec. I would love to see a cap sink kind of respec mechanisms in place. 
---
How are you deeming these rare/semi-rare compared to others?

I followed these steps and seems to be working, possibly coincidence but there is an issue with Xbox that’s explained here 
---
Tell that to the level 9 that *tried* to gank me with a pipe pistol while I was walking around in power armor. 
---
Yeah its pretty good early on but in endgame the TSE LMG is really good
---
You can no longer one shot/ damage a lot on players that wearing pvp gears with dense mod and fireproof perks. Explosive is not longer a big deal in pvp, why are they still nerfing it?
---
He’s talking about the Light Machinegun. It is probably one of, if not the most, underpowered weapons in the game. 
---
If he was an end game strength build he coulda won lol
---
I'm probably going to buy some more serums, also any recipes of them for sale? How much for those too?
---
Beating you in a fist fight as currency is a totally fantastic idea.  I love it.
---
Damn ive only seen 2 so I'm just going off of what ive heard
---
What class of games? Buggy? Glitchy? Full-priced beta? Enjoying this game is one thing but you legitimately think this is a great and solid product? 
---
the disconnects from that quest gave my doggo cancer.  truly sucked.
---
It isn't two shot. Just instigating and explosive.
---
It would be *so dope* if everyone would stop tagging Bethesda team members on mod questions, it creates so much noise on the wire for them.
---
Bethesda has already made a statement. If users are this worried, just don't use mods.
---
When in doubt, boil it out.
---
I never claimed to be a therapist, rather someone using common sense to search for a solution that’s fair for everyone.  
---
It’s interesting how illiterate people like you are - we didn’t instigate or continue the attacks.  We were pursued and killed multiple times.  If anything, we were trying to get our loot.  
---
Sounds more like you’re one of the trolls and bullies.  Have fun getting whatever karma brings your way in life.  For what it’s worth, you may wanna actually think about what you type or say to people.  Otherwise, you come off sounding really ignorant and idiotic.  Words to consider.
---
Peace out.  
---
Max level base damage for a regular one is 16. It also eats ammo like crazy. 
---
Almost all of these are either sold by the roaming vendor bot/rare drops from events/only available during the early quest line/only obtainable during the BETA/technical data stuff, things of that nature... So mostly just things you can't go and find lying about in the world
---
That's what I was thinking. Thank you.
---
But what do you even sell?
---
I updated my description. 
---
Maybe the crafted caps could be like lead tin aluminum or Steel?
---
That lag though, it’s buggy just to shoot it, couldn’t stand the explosive on top.
---
I snagged this off the Fallout Wikia, because I forgot most of the lore :/
---
“This particular type of armor was issued to the U.S. Marines operating in China during the Yangtze Campaign and Gobi Campaign between 2066-2077 before the Great War. It was most principally used in Nanjing, Shanghai and Gobi Desert, which seemed to have been the sites of most of the combat between the U.S. and their rivals, China.”
---
This is on the article for the Desert Rangers combat armor, located at Zion National Park. If it made it to China, could it somehow make it to Appalachia? Maybe a conflict there made the USMC deploy troops equipped with this type of armor? The riots, Espionage? Maybe that does make sense, maybe that doesn’t. I’m just saying, I think about it a lot. “Is there just a way it could exist?”
---
The LMG is OP to my .308 rounds, basically decimates hundreds of rounds in seconds.
---
Embrace our dark masters and give yourself to him!!
---
....some of you may die in the process but it is a sacrifice we are willing to make.
---
Yep I believe you're describing the Patrolman Sunglasses
---
Apparently it's not as OP as i thought just go with the other guy and sell it. I only saw 2 At level 30 so Idk
---
People are mad about PVP servers? It’s not unusual for players on any game to be disgruntled about weapon nerfs. I wish there were better ways to get great weapons besides the same boring and overcrowded nuke zone option. I welcome the changes and I hope the game improves. I look forward to diving into the vaults and seeing what we discover. 
---
Could be, i haven't seen it brought up on this sub or anywhere else myself. 
---
Just illustrates that not everybody wants to wait until "late game". I wouldn't mind throwing down some PVP on occasion but there is never anybody in my level range on the server. I'm a slacker who just hit 40 today. All I ever see is "fresh out of the vaults" and dudes over 100. 
---
Yeah they need to incorporate some form
---
Of respec. A hard to craft serum would work
---
I’ve seen a camp exploiting the dupe glitch have that many, or more. 
---
What does this even mean?
---
Exactly! It's actually good for the right builds. 
---
I only just killed my first queen the other day. As soon as fissure prime got nuked a bunch of people teleported there (as always) and they were all 50+, it was killed in less then 5 minutes. I thought it would have been way harder.
---
Need to add Scout Armor legendaries too, and the ability to craft it
---
Yes please this. I understand the need to modify this to prevent server hopping, but it's a little over the top .. and there's also a bug where some slain npcs respawn on death… overall point is replenishment needs a look see .. 
---
For instance, I logged in earlier to fight roughly 20-35 npcs .. I hit 2 spots I frequent, killing 5-8 npcs in each clip but I lost 2-4 bodies each clip(corpse immediately disappeared and they respawned) so I'm down on additional ammo/lost durability/used drugs/food I shouldn't be and none of the containers in the areas refreshed so it's double the frustration.
---
They hated Claystone95 because he told them the truth.
---
I occasionally get where I go to craft and I see the animation, but the menu doesn’t appear. Sometimes I get stuck like this. Can open the map, but can’t fast travel. Can’t open the pipboy either. 
---
Ha ha. That is very true.
---
Alright
---
More 10 cap noob bounties for the noble level 100+ bounty hunters to claim.
---
I kinda want to see the drill come up. Like putting some crazy big attachment on it and the furious effect. 
---
Regarding the incoming nerf to the Two shot/explosive weapons. 
---
As most, if not all the outrage from over powered TSE weapons came from being shot with them, it feels like I as a pure PVE player is being punished for something I didn't even do.
---
The solution would be simple:
---
 - Make the nerfs only count towards PVP. It doesn't hurt anyone that I can save them quickly with good weapons, or that I blast deathclaws into pieces.
---
 - Make PVP completely optional. Unless both players have agreed, or are on workshop property, we shouldn't be able to damage each other at all.
---
 - If the nerf sticks for both PVP and PVE (I really hope not), please also consider nerfing enemies. As other players can make new enemies spawn simply by showing up, and in their level too, the average player is always at an disadvantage until they reach level 50+. You could consider a damage increase that considers the players level versus the enemy, like you already do when a high level player engages a low level player.
---
I worked long to build up my characters stats. I'm level 185, and am doing a heavy gun build. I agree that TSE are too powerful, and could use a small nerf, but an overall damage reduction of 80% is WAY too much. If I am a high level player, I should be able to easily dispense with enemies at level 50-60. That is what the good legendary weapons are for, but now you are going to take the only worthy end game reward away.
---
I want my money back.
---
I agree to everything you said
---
PS4 :(
---
And did just that? 
---
do what you suggest but only provide melee weapons. 
---
I would have kept that. Or given it to me :p
---
I get where you're coming from. However, aren't there easy ways to determine if a file is what it's supposed to be? 
---
Like scanning for filename only is so 90's. Wouldn't you md5 that shit or do something similar to verify whether the file with the same name is the whitelisted one or not.
---
Better yet, if it's going to get to the whitelist stage, just incorporate that feature into the game. Much like the mod that prevents you from scrapping your mods will no longer be needed after the next patch.
---
Had two buzzing disconnects/crashes that dropped me back to home Xbox screen. 
---
Will my current character be able to play in the new PvP mode? Or will I have to make a new character ? 
---
What game are you playing?
---
In my opinion, they should actually raise the damage percentage to subgroup. 30% won’t cut it to sacrifice something even for 20% increase to all groups. They should at least make it to 50% then people might start considering it. 
---
LOL. That sounds like it might actually be kinda fun though. I just showed a few friends my epic board and then dropped it somewhere. I guess I rolled a critical failure for that drop.
---
You on xbone?
---
Yeah that's totally your fault for going to a PUBLIC event with a BOUNTY 
---
I refuse to believe this is the only solution.
---
Yeah it makes no sense, if a teammate can’t put in the code how come another randoms player can? At the expense of my nuclear code at that. That I didn’t even know.
---
The collective mind decided it was bad so all the sheep-people went along with it without analyzing the game for themselves 
---
Ps4 pro here and its gotten way worse. Did a fresh install and it still crashes randomly, usually when im running through the world or something. I thought i was alone so thankfully someone else has this problem lol. What pisses me off is that this lrobably wont get fixed until the next fucking patch smh
---
Angry tears are the best tears
---
\*in communism\* WE MUST REDISTRIBUTE THE EXPLOSIVE SHOTGUNS!
---
Having to kill high level enemies with two to three shots instead of one is terrible.  I think I'm just going to go play Fallout 4 set on very easy to get the experience of not being challenged at all instead. 
---
why is someone else's opinion not the same as yours?
---
Well, two-shot weapons do have horrible accuracy. I didn't figure that was a visible stat change, but I guess it is?
---
thank you for the reminder
---
This community sucks big time and I cant wait for mods and private servers to have fun with all the TSE's I want and not having to worry about all the whinny losers who dont like my build and play style
---
Well yeah but how about dat hard mass?
---
Sure there are a few ghouls but you can't get stable Flux without nuking white springs. 
---
What they said was something about addressing availabiltiy of plans.
---
That could be just as simple as fixing the bug that makes the handmade rifle plans unavailable via vendors after a certain level, or it could be a more comprehensive change. I, of course, am hoping for the latter.
---
I paid $60 (US) Pre-order. Love it. Play it with friends all the time. The sheeple saw the reviews and HURR DURR FURRUT SEVEMDY SIX BAHD

Why do people eat balut? There is no accounting for taste.

I've got a nocturnal pool hook with faster swing speed and I think 90% less weight.  
---
Thing shreds at night.  
---
There is just something fishy about it.  
---
In all honesty not completely true.  I plan on running on pvp servers so when  I see uneven fights I can step in and even the odds.
---
Right now groups get together some flag others dont, so you attack the flagged guys and his buddies kill u.....its a screwed up situation on normal servers.
---
What about the Ritual Mask and outfit?  300+ hours and I've never seen anyone else wearing them but me.  It's not rare?
---
I wish you could directly trade in goods inside the trading system. That needs to be implemented.
---
Oh man this will be the end of Bethesda, since someone is upset their clearly overpowered build is being nerfed
---
Yes people will pay for these but also pissed that they sell "weapon skins" for money instead of adding a real one.
---
&gt;Nuking that town near mama dolce's is pretty good for cobalt flux **and glowing ghoul spawns.**

&gt;“Get the Supply Drop”: “Get the Supply Drop” Event now will remove holotape once used with supply crate belonging to the player that requested the Supply Drop.
---
It could have had more detail but there it is.
---
What does that Bortherhood Event have to do with anything /s
---
Nah you can pick those up from the basement of the mothman museum. My buddy has worn them pretty much from the beginning lol, still look super cool though!
---
I would settle for the clocks to keep the PC/ console time on them.
---
According to B, you can use whatever build you want to and be efficient or at least I am under that impression. 
---
again by bethesda allowing that, they are inadvertantly allowing mods (plus hackers are hell smart, any method of whitelist detection would easily be circumvented).
---
But yes I agree, feature should be ingame, but im not answering to that, im answering to why someone may or may not get banned from using such a mod, and why bethesda may not respond to action.
---
Jumped in to help someone with a silo. Got through it then went to nuke zone. Crashed after a few minutes.
---
Fast travelled to a low level to give them some items. Dropped some stuff in a bag for them, they run off signalling for me to follow them. I pick the stuff back out of the bag and follow. Crashed.
---
I don't know how many times I've crashed or disconnected. I paid full retail release price for a game that has crashed more than any other PS4 game I have ever played. I don't know if any other PS4 game has ever crashed in my recollection. There is something seriously wrong with this game.
---
You need a different name, though, since sentinel is a legendary armor effect.
---
Update seemed stable at first. Now its doing the same for me as it was for you. I got double loadscreens and crashes left and right and constant DCs

The one thing of value that actually matters: Beating someone to death for a shotgun
---
What hat is that.
---
While I agree that the UI needs an update/rehaul, I don't know if it would make things any easier to split things up like that. It's definitely got merit. But if you play the game like it's designed (only keep what you use in your inventory), the lack of a more detailed system becomes a moot point. Less items to go through and all that.
---
It's not terrible but the cobalt is not as common as near the Watoga station.
---
For hard mass, and to draw others to aid, the country club at white springs is the only place to consider for hard mass.
---
I'd argue the prime site is just as good for cobalt and yields more hard mass. Though with the recent patch, you won't scrap it anymore so that will help to keep more of it on hand. 
---
I’ve been getting this often. I’ve even bought a new PS4 pro after doing the advised from Sony/Bethesda with saves, data and reinitializing. It is NOT the console, which is a ball ache. I am getting them less frequently when on the pro and I’ve noticed if I’m not in power armor I don’t seem to get them at all. Glad I’m not the only one.
---
I was on from about 9p to just now, stable the whole time.  Scanning the map a few times didn’t seem to populated in the world I connected too.  
---
It's a mystery... I kinda just chalked it up to something they gutted at the last second because food and water was already plentiful but they forgot the ui changes.... 
---
It could be an indicator of the growth rate for stuff you plant/build though... I haven't seen it tested at least. 
---
Soooo basically.....high levels wont be able to kill the queen anymore?
---
you're not living until you have dirt floors!
---
This game is already very very very easy. Dying is extremely rare and death has virtually no cost or drawback. 
---
Yes! I just want to be able to keep my player home and have a fire support platform to carry around with me. 
---
I think that would be awesome! This would be incredibly helpful for some people who prefer playing on their own, but don’t mind teaming up every once in a while. I wound up playing with another person earlier. I’m pretty sure he invited me to his team, but I’m just slow and can’t figure out teams yet. He even left me some ammo when I went back to the location for the end of the quest. 
---
Just go work on your camp while it is collecting.
---
I hear you.   I crash everyday.   And many times during exciting game play.   It would be nice if they could insert you back into the same world after crashing.  It works with teams!  (Still having fun even tho)
---
1 1/4 shot
---
Holy shit this is the only fucking mod i have on my excavator lol. You might be right since im crashing all the time on ps4. Im taking that shit off ASAP
---
So like the story replay from Borderlands? Cuz that'd be pretty awesome in FNV. I always have a beast of a character by the end of that game and would absolutely love to take on the powder gangers with my lvl 50 grunt!
---
Noble? Some call themselves "Bounty Hunters" and the rest like me are raiders who hunt them down and destroy everything they love before finishing them. 
---
Yes! This thread seems to answer it. 
---
I love the game. I would play it a lot more if it never crashed. I probably wouldn't have many complaints if I could just play it.
---
Got a drill from a 3* legendary earlier. I was pissed
---
Both this quest and the quest for Scribe Grant where you have to go to Vault Tec University, almost made me uninstall the game. I had to re-do the DMV quest 5 or 6 times due to DCs. I lost count of the Grant quest, but I know it was more than that. 
---
Of course! Happy to help 😁

I found the lever-action plans there after checking the railroad vendor forever, he's definitely worth visiting.

Probably none. The person you’re replying to has never commented in a game subreddit until this one, and all his comments here are to talk shit.

Chances are they’re salt miners.

I think the fact you paid 95 dollars is why you are online trying to convince others you liked this game and didn’t waste 100 bucks on a bad game like a dummy
---
Is this supposed to be some freshly posted, witty retort that anyone even cared about? It's as if you have a giant "How Am I Doing" sticker on yourself. I thought I'd finally let you know.
---
This was in another thread and im trying it as soon as i can but when you crash do you have a targeting hud mod on your power armor? 
---
Two-shot = +25% damage... that doesn't make sense? 
---
This is what happens to me 90% of the time. The other 10% is what OP described above. Both are annoying, but getting stuck doing the crafting animations with no menu is significantly more irritating because it only seems to happen when enemies are around. So it's almost gotten me killed.
---
I wish I could have been there 
---
I mean, two shot is a problem too. How is a 100% damage bonus balanced when creature type bonuses are like 30%?
---
I have a question about uranium fever- do you actually have to do anything other than kill the mole miners and protect the machines? In other words; are all of the rewards given at the end of event screen? 
---
Then calculate the actual percentage and show me that. I fiymt two shots very accurate with iron sights. 
---
In vats it basically shoots bullets wildly in either direction 
---
i like the game myself, but like other bethesda games, mods make my experience for them
---
I think it happens when you try to turn or look while still in the 'backing out' animation. Try waiting until it's completely finished.
---
You seem to have forgotten your Raider flair. And I don't hunt noobs. I take them under my wing and give them everything they need to lure your kind into an eternal abyss.
---
Aren't you overlooking a lot of the game's flaws in the same way that these reviewers overlooked the good aspects of the game?
---
You think these people would be fair and re-review after several months or the game has stabilised. Nah, they one-and-doned it like you'd probably expect them too.
---
It's pretty sad as humans we look up to authority figures without being more critical with our thinking. For better or worse, they're the "authority figures" we have in gaming.

We don't care either. Bye.
---
You can kill anything with lower dmg yes, but intentionally gimping yourself then complaining you do low dmg seems stupid on a multitude of levels
---
That is why it is a legendary weapon. 
---
It's alright. The idea of having strong opinions about this game either way is like having a strong opinion about toast.
---
Technically? But no one ever does Uranium Fever for the event rewards. I don't even know what it gives you, maybe nuclear material?
---
The point of Uranium fever is the guaranteed three legendary mole miners it spawns, and the crapload of shotgun shells you get from the waves of miners. 
---
Criminal's logic
---
You would have a future as a lawyer
---
Melee will be nerf too. No fun shall be had!.
---
Great work! It's good to see lots of the outfits in the game! Do you have the civil war outfits yet?
---
nah, it gives you stuff to do with your levels so you can have different builds
---
this is why i disagreed with people who didnt want extra copies from perk packs, its a life saver to have lower level versions of your perk cards
---
i gotchu https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ah0rrp/an_idea_for_a_perk_that_works_with_wood_armor/
---
&gt;There's no real story and no real NPC's.
---
There are both. Just because you don’t interact with human NPC’s doesn’t mean it has neither of these things.
---
Must be weird being so heavily invested in a video game item that you are willing to boycott an entire company because you are salty about not getting to 1 shot shit anymore.
---
Just a friendly reminder, its a fucking game.
---
I refuse to purchase Atoms due to the terrible roll-out &amp; support of this game. As much as I want to buy those things in the shop.
---
15 endurance for HP mutation is scalely skin
---
How come you have a raider flair (Yes i realized and changed mine) and you help noobs but even with TSE shotguns i have fireproof maxed and a dense chestpiece. I could STILL destroy them but only if provoked.
---
Appalachian Antiques is a possible spawn for them
---
850 hours??? Holy shit 
---
I actually assumed this was the plan. You choose to join from the menu. I really hope it’s a totally new server and you need to start over. 
---
So much this.
---
isn't wood armor with dark mod good for stealth builds?
---
I can't stand buying one Nuka Grape at a time from Bubbles at the Whitespring.
---
Life givever fireproof rejuvenated all help with defense and hp
---
Yes, and make them drop the rarest plans, rather than this server hopping madness.
---
Yep already have all the ones you can find just laying about 👍
---
Yes. Two-shot slap dmg is still slap dmg. Explosive ignores the slap mechanics. 
---
Literally just found a TS hunting rifle. Not happy about this choice at all. Though I was probably more pissed when I got the gun and it was weaker than my TS lever action. 
---
Plus with a 50 Cal conversation kit I'd expect it to blow the lever action out of the water.  I really rarely heard anyone complaining about two shots in general 
---
Yeah I actually like this idea a lot.
---
I completely agree and it’s one of my favorite parts of Skyrim and Fallout games. But fallout76... this game is different and has different needs in order to work properly. There should be alternatives to keeping the lore, while not taxing the asset management system. 
---
Decided to get on Ebay to see how much modders have exploited the game. Oh yes, people have exploited the shit out of this game lol
---
I have a shrouded wood set it's fun to play with 
---
People will complain about anything. And adding the classic looks as skins for current weapons just means future content releases will include all-new items instead of rehashing the old ones, so I think it'd give us room for more improved content rather than taking anything away.
---
I mean I've been having fun with the game but I acknowledge its barely holding itself together and is not up to the quality I would expect from Bethesda, which was already to the point I expect the modding community to have to fix their games to begin with.
---
But hey, whatever its not like that stops jetpacking around with a gatling gun or building stripclubs by watoga station from being any less enjoyable. It also doesn't make the valid criticisms any less valid.
---
Just my opinion here, but maybe stop engaging with them? I come here to read stories about the game, check out other peoples builds, wantch videos, etc. Not once have I ever given anything more than a chuckle when I see some teenager throwing a fit.
---
Yes, they are dedicating way too much time to hating on a fucking game. But you are also dedicating a shit ton of time worrying about what they are saying. Ignore it and move on. It really is that simple.
---
The feel-good nature of player interaction is actually a shining spot in the game now, hope they don't discourage that too much. Loving the idea of the PvP-world; only because it'll keep them away from *me*!
---
executioners is 50% mutants is 10% assassins is 10% why should two shot add more damage when all these have conditional modifiers 
---
Anyone with tse bought it with irl money...
---
I haven't found any interesting legendary weapons yet. I've got some ok legendary armour, but nothing exciting. Lack of storage space means I've sold most of them to robots.
---
 I figured .308, its got to be good. Ignore the tiny number. No its awful. ;)
---
 Try a Gatling Gun, I was surprised how well it works.
---
hell no, i make other characters to try out different builds, but the extra chores like doing fetch quests and getting plans feels unbearable after the first time
---
Danke
---
Not every one but a good chunk have bought them, which is sad. 
---
🥺
---
I would imagine they would say you keep playing it due to sunk cost.  You paid $95 so you have to justify that amount.  
---
But honestly both perspectives are silly.  The game scratches that itch for a lot of people and they have fun with it.  So if you enjoy it, play it.  What's it matter what reviews say if you already own it.  They do nothing for you.  
---
On the other hand it is bad game from a technical perspective.  Texture issues, crashes, disconnects, insane amounts of bugs.  The game has a LOT of issues. People like you and me that play this game deal with and over look a lot of crap to play, but you know what...both groups can be right.
---
Kind of breaks the new player experience with the story and balance.

---
Happening to me as well with Excavator chest. 
---
I've got a weekend with my brother planned, then I'll get it up asap.
---
I get it.
---
My heart goes out to everyone who spent RL cash on pixels that aren't going to be as good after the nerf.
---
That's gotta be really tough :-(
---
Shucks...
---
Maybe we're having a misunderstanding. Noobs with bounties are good bait, and can be recruited to trap the bounty hunters looking for easy caps.
---
&gt; Make content that players need to get creative to beat. 
---
I hope they do. This was one of my favorite things about the old games and then to a lesser degree the Bethesda ones--all the many ways you could tackle the situations you found yourself in.
---
the game is buggy but that said i have had more fun with this "broken" game then most "finished" games i have played in the last few years
---
You forgot your /s
---
I also paid 95$ and am also in Canada and am also in the same position as you right now. It's stupid.
---
I think I might have been in that one. Thought to myself that’s where I’m gonna drop it next time. But it was when I realized I could run strait to the train station without being irradiated.  Then I got dc’d :(
---
Why, its going to be useless. Except my 4 pieces of wepon reduced weight 20% armor.
---
I just solo'd Silo Alpha and launched my first nuke ever.  I ended up having to run to the site (it was relatively close because I was curious what would happen if I nuked another location), because I was over encumbered..  Within site of the radiation close, game crashed.
---
Congratulations! Under absolutely no circumstances read the latest announcement from Bethesda.
---
Nerfing the mods that make killing enemies not a chore won't help the game. I thought the whole point of bullet sponge enemies was because you eventually get these powerful weapons that makes killing them easier, but of course that was another unintended gameplay feature by Bethesda. Now melee will still reign supreme because it is the easiest way to do damage.
---
Youre a moron.
---
I level of all is better than 3 levels of one. The second and third points in each one are worth half as much as the first point is.
---
Hahaha
---
I love this idea. Make legendary enemy's like miniature bosses, with special effects. one of the biggest drawbacks of PvE is enemies are 100% cookie cutter. You always know what kind of fight to expect after the first round.
---
Yeah i think I'm piecing together that this is the case:/ it's strange. It's so much less accurate that even with double damage, it functions the same because only half the shot ever connects lol
---
I was using a sniper rifle, and strength perks to boost my sledge.  Kinda like you.
---
When I found a Two Shot Gatling (5mm ammo) I changed over.  Found a Speed Mod and now love it.
---
I do certainly get the lack of attention to heavies.  And energy weapons.
---
You're right and I think we did have a misunderstanding. 
---
That’d be pretty cool
---
Yeah i heard theyre nerfing tses
---
Do yourself a favor and throw it on the ground
---
That was my reaction too, not looking forward to the massive two shot nerf. I have a two shot handmade, no other effects, and it isn't super op, but strong enough that I don't need a full magazine to kill one super mutant that is the same level as me. 
---
Have fun with SBQ fights when you cant het her to mutate before she flies off. Im out.
---
:-(
---
Yes duping sucks but unbalancing the core of game because of it? Ive have legit found a tse gatling as well as a bloody explosive, that's what pushed me to keep going to lvl250 the thought of finding something good.
---
Ya cause then everyone can do everything ,no need for perks at all just make every toon Superman.
---
Clearly an Endurance build, cause I don’t know how else they made it this far
---
Weapon weights in general. I think melee has an perk but for firearms weight reduction I have to use legendary armor. Would be nice 
---
not only are the TSE posts all just a big circlejerk of people parroting the same opinion but they already changed their stance on the nerf and there are still new posts about it
---
I literally just got one.   I agree they’re OP as fuck but they need to stay at least powerful enough to be worth keeping.
---
I would like to once again state my desire to make a chapel made out of and filled with all the atomic shop items and start the Children of Atom up

Where do you go?

---
What is exactly wrong with buffing other legendary effects to two shot's level?
---
Just as long as mirror force remains banned I welcome this idea.
---
I actually worked hard for my stuff, unlike the cheaters.
---
I grinded for meta build because im an actual MMO player.
---
Now im getting kicked in the teeth and wastes 100 hours farming shit thats useless.
---
No, fuck that.  
---
Oh in 76 I haven’t either. I’m really kind of taking a break from it. I don’t really have time to sink in it like I want right now. But I played quite a bit of 4 when it came out lol
---
Bloodied. Or server without noobs just those who actualy fight. 1noob afking there and it will be hard. But dont worry, we find new better builds. Finaly ppl have  reason to try new builds.
---
How doesn’t it make sense? It’s the exact opposite of your criticism. Your game runs like a bag of hot dicks, whereas others doesn’t. Just because your experience is such and such, doesn’t mean everyone else will share your experiences. 
---
Because you deleted your original post, for some reason, I am unable to reference exactly what you said. I do however know that I am correct. 
---
I'm not sure how to take this?
---
Plenty of people have strong opinions toast?
---
Like do you like it golden brown or burnt?
---
So you mean normal?
---
Then again, with the way you phrased it you could just as easily mean silly especially seeing as toast is often used for gags? Memes? You know how some people make little cartoons about toast with the little beady eyes and line smile. 
---
This is your first time doing that?
---
You new?
---
Like the idea, one of the best I've heard :)
---
If you're on PS4, I think I was watching the same thing from the opposite side. 
---
Its cool. Ill just fall back to FFXIV. No harm done.
---
Ever live the legend of the big fat turd bethsoft left in the punchbowl of Fallout fans.

oof :(
---
The free fast travel already makes it a viable player hub. And you can build a shop on the stairs. Your problem is convincing players to make use of a hub
---
instigating has a conditional modifier target has to be on full life
---
TSe will still be the most powerful weapons cept for bloodied and if you are willing to risk low life you should  get a buff
---
The reality is they have no proper system to remove the duped guns....those are the most duped guns......nerf them so people get rid of them cause space is limited.....then *rebalance* them to 50% not 25% and they solve the duped gun issue.
---
It's a crappy fix but it's why I think they are doing it like this.
---
Did you report them as well?
---
No way, just got tired of seeing the negative videos relentlessly published on Youtube.  I want to make the case for the game because ive had a lot of fun despite the many irritations. 
---
Well seeing as how I grinded for 100 hours to make a meta build and now its useless................
---
Do yourself a favor and quit covering for Bethesda's entitled attitude. 
---
The dupe glitches work because of a fail safe in the system. 1st they force a crash, and then the server rolls back their inventory to before the crash. It's a fail safe to protect the average player and is being exploited by stupid fucks. The only way to truly stop people from using it is to remove the inventory protection all together, which could arguably be worse than having dupers, because then you have the potential to loose your entire inventory.
---
Forgot the union cap
---
The terminal in Vault 76 said it would be inhospitable after reclamation day to encourage people to rebuild the world and not hide away in the vault.
---
Whatever the solution would be would involve slowing down the trade process to prevent accidents. Trading is not meant to be a 5 second event.
---
That one's easy to get though
---
You seem upset.
---
Got attacked by a level 65 mothman as a level 35. I had about 100 random rounds total, was double over-encumbered and had 1 and a half super sledges. I punched it to death.
---
Buhbye
---
Yeah lol gave me a great reason to uninstall this piece of work
---
It is totally this. And it's the Sensor Array as well.
---
Took my helmet off. No more CE-34878-0 crashes.
---
Recon sensors are okay though. Have these on my X-01 and things are stable.
---
Oh thanks for answering. I’ve really no idea what DOT mixes are or the 4000-6000 bit means but I’m glad someone in the know can answer my question. An anarchist friend of mine, mentioned it as a way to delay/halt construction of housing development on a nearby common ground. 
---
well if it wasn't for the dupers i think it could have been a great economy now we just have to wait for them to fix duping completely and raise weapon lvls so the economy can be fixed
---
Yeah, I expected this from Bethesda. Well, I hope your account gets unbanned. They can’t even enforce their own rules right...
---
I was. Im over it.
---
The economy won’t be worth anything unless the duping gets patched out.
---
“Boohoo, I can’t one-shot stuff anymore; god-forbid I have to put effort on killing things!”
---
and lad the rail car with explosives and nukes! Atom bomb baby!
---
For sure it's getting annoying that I'll never get some camp plans without search high and low for them. I feel like I wanna stop checking watoga vendors since they always seem to have the same rotation of plans I already have. 
---
Grahm too he's had nothing good on him the last handful of times ive seen him. Wish I could feeed chally every time we were found each other and eventually he'd give us a friends and family discount. Off topic but still 
---
 Its a Gimp Suit head. ;) I make and sell them as they are very profitable. I get 28 caps for them at any vendor. 
---
 Get plans from the display cases in Harper's Ferry mostly. They do show up on a bot once in a while.
---
Im a sneak/snipe.
---
I oneshot everything regardless
---
This sub is just an echo chamber that can boil down to the same few things:
---
-	“We hate TSE weapons because we don’t have them and something something slap damage.”
---
-	“Dupers dupers dupers dupers”
---
-	“Servers are unstable due to duping” but obviously not Beth’s shit netcode.
---
-	“Remove PvP because I never use it and don’t want to remember about pacifist mode.”
---
Ad nauseum.
---
"which are" and it's true, 3-5 stars legendaries are god tier legendary.
---
even then "farming god tiers legendary which are 3 stars - 5 stars item" doesn't mean he's been getting the 4 or 5 stars. he's just saying he's looking for god tier legendaries which are 3 - 5 stars legendary.
---
The hat? The only way I got my hands on it was from a redditor
---
There’s mods here?
---
If u selling or can make it for me lmk I’ll pay 💰 
---
Good luck to solo players fighting scorchbeasts and hordes of enemies RIP
---
Subjective opinions aside, there is no reason currently not to use two-shot and explosive on all weapons (excluding melee).  Precisely because they are overpowered.  
---
&gt; When you own a workshop you are essentially opening yourself up to PVP at any point in time ANYWHERE on the map. 
---
That sounds like a bug or unintended feature. Would have thought contest over a workshop should be WITHIN a workshop area.
---
PA sensor array is bugged. 
---
If you have it on take your helmet, take it off. 
---
Fixed my crashes in entirety.
---
Thanks, I'll give it a shot this weekend! I'll keep my fingers-crossed that I can murder that pesky Sloth!
---
I'd like it if it had some form of deep storage not on the server I'm playing on, meaning that player hub exists in a vacuum on a different server allowing for more people and more storage
---
Yeah it spawns just east of hopewell cave at the graveyard
---
Is it that difficult to repair weapons?
---
Now it makes sense that vendor bot sold me a TSE mini gun yesterday for 561 caps. I thought I got one over on him but it looked like I was the sucker now.
---
So is melee fine in single player if its gonna be far and away better than any other weapon type, with nothing coming even close. Ya no.
---
I can make you both tomorrow, and upgrade the wetsuit. It's not the best upgrade, but I have it. Message this username on xb1 if interested.

It’s not like it matters, anyway. Bethesda already has your 60$.

I should have also said ranger district office. 
---
Oh, Scott... you shouldn't have!
---
I was always a PC gamer and friends were easy to find. Since playing exclusively on PS4, I’ve always missed being able to easily find good peeps. FO76 has been wonderful in that aspect.

Well fuck if only I knew that earlier.

This only affects hip fire accuracy, and has 0 effect on aiming down sights.
---
 I'm on PC. Really its not great at all. Its a bit of a joke really as its just a costume.  
---
Lol, I would recommend trying a quick Google search before taking someone's word from Reddit
---
They said "mode" not "servers." There isn't enough info right now with certainty what that really means.
---
I use a medics shotgun with other perks and love it. Can literally run the world without stimpacks. In fact the medics perk, with a build built around it can be a team essential.
---
I was going through a silo with two other teammates and 90% of the way through my game crashed, sad to say without me my team was decimated by spawn glitches brought on by assaultrons spawning by the handfuls. We were dealing with the strange issue before this but without me it got bad fast.
---
Hopefully this reply got to you fast enough.

Borderlands style co-op is something I've really really wanted in a fallout or elder scrolls  game. It would be amazing to build settlements with friends and have cool exploration. Maybe in the next one. I'd like it to be up to four or six friends. That would be killer. 
---
They should give good rewards once per day then the normal shitty rewards to promote variety instead of repeating whatever is most efficient. You need to protect people from themselves.
---
I have 125 unused perk points/level points and I would wish for the ability to disable or "hide" cards so the change of my perk setup or "deck" as some call them wouldn't be such a fiddly affair that I genuinely consider installing that preset mod.

Yea

yep, the whiners will come for that next.

Q: Imagine that I want to play alone. There will be no specific areas of the map or only PvE dedicated servers like for example with World of Warcraft? 
---
A: Not at the launch. When you come into play you can see the other players but you will not be forced to interact with them; you can play on your own. You can see them but you do not have to fight them. Maybe you can use them to exchange items, to join a team, or you can visit their camp. There are a lot of things you can do with other players that is not a comparison with weapons.
---
Q: Ok, but can other players destroy it or steal something from you? Can you move it?
---
A:Yes, other players can damage it, but only partially. But it costs very little to repair it. The reason we make it damaged is because it is possible to confine another player in the camp, if it can not break it becomes a problem. That's why we decided to make the camps destructible: not because we want to stimulate others to attack your shelter but to prevent players from using the camp to annoy other players. It's still very easy to repair and when you get disconnected, it disappears.
---
Those are just two examples from a single interview with Todd Howard. He clearly says we will NOT be forced to interact with other players. He also clearly says camps are only destructible to PREVENT griefing, and not to allow players to instigate PVP. 
---
Consider this, everyone who is arguing against this man. Let’s say you’re helping noobs in Flatwoods with fertile soil. Let’s say there’s a lvl 150 with a camp right on the edge of Flatwoods. Let’s say you kill a farmhand and a stray bullet hits their wall and now you’re wanted. Now they try kill you in the middle of this event and you have no way to defend yourself. (This exact scenario happened to me today)
---
And before anyone says turn pacifist mode on, no. I prefer to play the game the way it was intended. If I hit someone on purpose or accident and they wish to fight, then we will fight. Slap damage is negligible so I feel no guilt towards accidentally swiping a few every now and the same goes those that do the same to me.
---
TLDR: why have a wanted system where you can’t defend yourself at least. If that was the intended mechanic then devs would’ve coded upon killing player -&gt; run suicide.exe
---
a pig does not know it lives in a sty
---
That must be why make character randomly grunts in Neanderthal. Still trying to figure out why he grunts when I jump off a cliff in PA.
---
This is what happens when people actually explore the map ;). I ran into the building to take cover from Super Mutants (back when I could barely keep myself fed), and was pleasantly surprised to hear this friendly vendor offer me his wares. 
---
grats man!  I still have never found one :(
---
I mean. Not really though. The point is to give incentive for people to ok you back. They already have every advantage in having “first shot” in a one shot meta. No need to turn on god mode as well.
---
:-)
---
You on PS4 ? I can hook you up 
---
Agreed, I’ve got most of the stuff you’ll need if your on X1 as well. Won’t be back on until tomorrow though. 
---
Had people do this to me before as well. It sucks. 
---
It would simply be more convenient also if you could find a similar weapon and scrap it from inventory to repair your own
---
&gt; Then calculate the actual percentage and show me that. 
---
I don't need to calculate anything. It increases the spread by 150% and recoil by 100%. This is straight from the game files.
---
I wonder if there’s a new exploit that’s causing trouble?
---
Is false advertising also against Bethesda’s terms of use policy or nah?😂🤣
---
Will you accepthuman flesh?
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
He is right actually, nothing should be nerfed, and the damage tables should be changed for pvp so what used to one shot now only does 10-20% damage so it's a actual fight 
---
Gorge Junkyard, west of Morgantown. Be aware of workshop griefing if you do this (you're potentially enabled for PvP anywhere on the map), or you may lose all your junk again.
---
Yeah :(
---
Leveled up my int wayyy too early not realizing at 15, i couldn't get more crafting cards by selection.  Now most are half way through to max perk until level 50, killing my joy of finding special plans.
---
Almost as weird as crying like a baby because someone on the internet says they dont like something you blindly support.
---
WHY WOULD YOU NERF TWO SHOT?! that was never the problem... it was two shot combined with the explosive mod... I rely on two shot weapons to make mobs feel less spongy and to actually deal consistent damage, and I’ve been hunting for them for weeks. This change is ridiculous... at least make it 50% instead of 25... or have it not affect PVP and make it only usable against PvE. You’re literally kneecapping my hard work farming two shot weapons and I’m really pissed about it. 
---
i wouldn't chuck them.  For heavies like Gat and .50 cal, might want to keep an eye out of AA or Furious though.
---
Thank you wizened sage. 
---
Id like to see them do something like the earth mover event, at the Nuka Factory.  Or maybe something like Feed the People.  you have to collect X, or craft Y, or collect X and craft it into Z, then slot A into tab B and it starts up some machine you have to defend against waves of baddies before spitting out NUKA COLA!!!!!
---
I got a 1 star Hunters rolling pin once. Never have i sold anything so quickly
---
"Its exactly like the game your playing now just without PVP restriction."
---
Sounds like pvp servers to me
---
lol why is this getting down-voted it's completely true
---
It also affects vats, as the 2nd bullet seemingly causes both bullets to miss quite a bit.

I thought it was just running through watoga that was crashing me but this is probably it. Good look

The game needs to move on. It sucks that the market was there, but it's kinda short sighted to think that road wasn't leading off a cliff. Like, this game has been eviscerated for it's flaws, but you're buying broken code for decent money on hawk sites? That is some weird ass dedication.
---
This is what I love about ESO. I’ve played it every summer with my friends since launch and we’ve always had a blast returning to the new hard &amp; end game content. 
---
Getting your ass kicked in a way that makes you say, “fuck, I need to figure out how to do this” is a good thing. Maybe you come back with a build that’s better suited, or finding a particular weak spot, crippling the limbs so it can’t hit you so much, etc.
---
Check that all the parts are still equipped.
---
They seem to un-equip on fast travel sometimes.
---
Yes since the update I haven’t been able to have more than 15 minute sessions and guess what next update bringing more nerfs and not working on stability 
---
I just found this post because I wanted to know more information about anyone else having troubles with the unfair pvp system of workshops. And as I read no one understood the the guy who posted this, but man I feel your rage. The same thing happened to me. I claimed the workshop and left, I didn't want to do anything with it just wanted the quest rewards, then someone dropped a nuke on the queen so I headed there... half map away from my workshop. While we were busy killing the queen with 2 of my friends, the guy who started to claim my workshop but stopped the claiming halfway, fast traveled to us and one shotted each of us while we were busy with the queen. there were no option like ignore seek revenge or anything. only respawn. I respawned and my friends too. and he one shotted us again.. and again. I turned off my pacifist mode and killed him. After I killed him he fast traveled back to my workshop started to claim it again then stopped it half way and fast traveled back to us. killing us again. we finished the queen by the time he got back. This lvl 300 guy kept killing my lvl 40 friend over and over again until he just quit to main menu. I managed to kill the guy again. He did the trick again. fast travel to my workshop start claiming then stopping it halfway fast travel back to me at watoga Station and killed my other friend who was managing his stash. I was able to get the guy again. and then he goes, wow bravo you got me again and then he quit. Oh yeah what the original poster said, we all lost money when he killed us. I lost 150 caps when he killed me during the queen but when I killed him I got 40 caps back. Now my question is simple... how is this fair? don't tell me it is supposed to work like this. don't tell me that is completely fine that anyone can corpse camp you anywhere on the map just because you own a workshop on the other side of the map. 
---
It's the Gorge Junkyard, just east of the Landview Lighthouse. 
---
I didn't take his word for it, I was just so desperate to get one I offered to buy it off someone and a guy stopped by and gave me his
---
Still waiting for that dragon breath shotgun shell btw.
---
For a few hours, yup.
---
Yep, that's because VATS uses hip fire unfortunately.
---
I started a new character last night. The first quest is broken. The entire main quest line wouldn't start.
---
I think I'll take a break and give them time to fix some stuff.
---
Unless you called in the supply drop it now counts as a pvp action.
---
This in no way would add any additional buffs to our builds.
---
It would just save some time digging through perk cards before switching tactics
---
I logged in today right in the middle of a pack of level 50 Mirelurk Kings. I had to make a mad dash away from them as soon as it finished loading. Once I got away I realized I had a corpse marker at the point I started at and my junk was gone. 
---
The mobs had killed me as I was loading, before I even managed to get in game. This occurred just north of Smith Farm, and the Dogwood Die Off event was active.
---
Noice. I've seen the coat worn by a few people but never foind it myself. I've been dying to get my hands on one to go with the Black Cowboy Hat I found so I can complete my pistoleer build. Thanks for the info.
---
you say that as if bloodied doesn't exist for guns? the patch just balances those weapons to what they should've been at launch.
---
also can all the people complaining/supporting the patch stick to one thread it's getting a little old seeing so many [Discussion] TSE posts
---
Well I'm glad it worked out then haha
---
I'm not telling you to calculate anything m I want the game to factor in whatever modifications it's making to my stats and display that as the probability.  Vats should not say 95 percent when it isn't 95 percent. If it's technically correct I don't care. I want it to accurately calculate my chances of a hit. 
---
I had a two shot with increased vats a accuracy that read 95 percent nearly all the time and yet it was never true. 
---
With no other humans in the game there simply must be human fodder. You are now the NPC. 
---
Not a problem, hope it helps 👍
---
Hey there, possible for you to craft it for me? I have the mats. 
---
TAE should only be nerfed for pvp and left normal for pve, I love being op against  enemy’s , makes it more fun for me 
---
Agreed... Dilly Dilly!!
---
I've had this happen on login a couple of times today. Jump to another server and all is well. 
---
Not sure about fast travel, I don't do that.
---
Yes on 2 of my sets. T60 and t45 
---
the Bos one? there is antique shop near watoga with spawn of BoS cosmetic items, you can get it on right side in corner, just run it thru, if you dont find it dont take anything and server hop, or take things and come back few hours after. I had medics hat or what the fuck it is, and it looks super coool.
---
FYI turn them in one at a time because I had 30 and turned them in and only got a single reward.
---
Stop eyeballing my pirate hat.
---
I believe you are asking the wrong question. It is why are creature type bonuses only 30%? Things don't necessarily need nerfs (aside from the obvious seperation of 2shot and explosives together), they need to buff the shit thats useless.
---
I dont buy much. Just plans. Armor from vendors occasionally if it fits a set.
---
ASSUME THE P O S I T I O N
---
They are part of random spawn of BoS cosmetic shit in antique shop near watoga.
---
I got mine for like $40 after Christmas, bought a Physical copy (Xbox One) came with a lot of extra stuff, steel book case, 500 Atom, a vault tec controller skin. It was pretty nice. 
---
Limit yourself to like 2-3 guns and work with it. It's not that hard. 
---
TSE were grossly OP. They still will likely be top tier since it's brought down the level of all the top tier items that use either or both of these effects.
---
They already have chameleon assaultrons.
---
Oh I will never support this “patch” also I have used bloodied gun tyvm and they are ok but at about 10 health the damage on bloodied explosive weapons is still less than tse
---
Hoy shit I actually forgot VATS was even in this game lmao.
---
That is a thought...RDR handles PVP in interesting ways but I like that you brought it up because there's somethings Fallout could take a few pages from. Passive systems or the duel fights with a timer so people can duke it out. Given I'm just like you in RDR...ruin the peace and you're getting chased out of town(server) and I'd love to be able to do that in Fallout. 
---
No, keep playing. -Bethesda
---
Did you read the part about not being able to access the player hub version until after completing a relevant quest? 
---
I've got a ton of screws and springs on ps4 if you need
---
Yep there is chance to get most of BoS cosmetic clothing and some military too.
---
shhhhhh... aha i noticed that and I don’t want it to get out 😂 it’s a pay to win helmet aha 
---
On one of the terminals, it said that after everyone had left the vault a poison gas was realised into the vault so people wouldnt be able to return.
---
You’re right it’s grossly op when it’s really the only weapon you can dome and enemy with and secure a kill the ammo consumption of other weapons is just ridiculous hell make the enemies dish out lots of damage but have less health🤷🏻‍♂️
---
New Game+  hmmm....  
---
I dont see how you could make it work really.  Not with the way the servers are implemented.  Maybe once we get fully private servers you could have quest resets like that though.  Might be interesting.
---
That is hardly objective considering bloodied+explosive is significantly better and quad+explosive better than tse for some weapons too. Objective would be that tse was very strong combination and should be mutually exclusive to each other.
---
nope ps4 :/. But i served hop watoga a lot and they often sell 2-3 pieces each
---
And for the love of God please increase the camp budget 
---
Solo player here.
---
This pretty much kills the game for me. The grind for ammo and gun repair mats was brutal, the entire lore to keep grinding was to eventually get my hands on a weapon that would balance the game for me. Now that I finally got a quad explosive rifle they Nerf it.
---
Spending an hour trying to kill a mob of level 62 super  mutants solo with broken guns and no ammo sucks. I'm probably done after this maybe I'll pick up Diablo III again in my Switch :(
---
You got a frog in your pocket, buddy? Or just having an inner dialogue?
---
I wonder why the cards just don't just stack to a max limit, instead of combining to increase rank. I mean, they're cards. Seems a more realistic way for cards to behave anyway. ;P 
---
You're completely defenseless though.  They can attack you without being able to be attacked back.  That's shit.
---
oh shit!
---
well, to make sense, maybe it's weak to black titanium or something
---
I never spent a cent in real life for one. Ive never duped a single thing. I will be a sad little bever when they nerf my arsenal. Ive spent a ton of time grinding, trading, farming, saving and spending caps, ammo, valuables etc to get them. 
---
Ads is the same as trash mobs or whatever.  It's the regular scorched etc that show up with the queen.
---
Pretty much, though I generally only see them in the silos. 
---
Agreed! Woud LOVE for it to be this way instead. Easily just stack/unstack "upgrades" as needed.
---
You want a HELL mode like in Diablo.
---
The HUB 76 would be a separate instance that the new player vault 76. So new or sub 50 players would not have access to it.
---
Preach! This needs to be out there more.
---
Try it out. Fixed my problem entirely.
---
Kudos to DJSnaek for finding it. Gild that guy if you can.
---
&gt;I teabag to show humanity
---
That brought a tear to my eye. As a fellow Halo man, I too teabag all the friendly vault dwellers I see
---
But during an event, you are completely defenseless.  You cannot attack back at all if they attack you.  There's absolutely nothing you can do.  When they attack you normally you can at least defend yourself though they get the first shot.  It's a fucked bug.
---
This post again...
---
If you can find weapons in combo with reduced weight as a third perk, you're golden. 
---
Weapon weight reducing armour with deep pockets and +1 Strength can also help if you're usually out of PA(would only invest in one piece until full patch details are out), while Calibrated Shocks for PA cover that angle.
---
As well, as one of those folks who fought everything prior to the mass influx of TSE's, you'll get by, it'll all still kill everything just fine even in it's nerfed state. You just won't coast as much anymore.
---
One time I destroyed a camp on purpose, two other times not, and one time from stealing a supply req.
---
Yep it’s ridiculous you end up spending all your time trying to maintain your guns and they don’t do shit to enemies anyway at this point think I’m gonna start playing some damn flappy bird
---
But isn't the whitespring resort a trading hub already? It's where everyone goes to find plans from vendors
---
Yeah that’s what I was thinking. I leveled 2 characters to 30 and now the servers seem to be going down a lot for me for some reason. So I’ll give it some time. My wife still plays so I’ll have regular updates on how things feel I’m sure.
---
Seriously. This subreddit needs to learn to search for shit before posting. I constantly see posts about something that was posted a few hours ago.
---
The problem is, there probably isn't a way to tell if any items has been duped or not, so thatmay not be an option for them.
---
that's due to the multiplicative damage of explosive weapons... the update will likely make TS do a bit less damage than bloodied, as the weapon where you need to be at very low health should always be better than one that just affects your accuracy a little (it's called risk-reward gameplay).
---
Always put your junk in your stash box. Especially if you are going in dangerous locations.
---
I can hook you up with some black titanium on PS4. 
---
But you can't defend yourself.  They can just murder you and there's nothing you can do to defend back.  You can't do any damage to them.  It's bugged and it's bullshit.
---
Thats why im not a fan of the slap system. Its like a pve game with weak fan service for pvp players. It really has to be closer to all or nothing. 
---
What I love about pvp servers that allow for more than just pvp is people like you, though. 
---
Like in dark souls, ill often turn and defend the host against my allies. Sometimes its fun to even the odds and go against the grain. A game that allows that does really well for a pvp community. Pvp is about novelty
---
Another question is why wear fireproof when explosives got heavily nerfed. They actually made that perk good for what was going on in the game then made it worthless again.
---
Honestly this is a non-issue. At 20 caps an hour every other workshop generates far more lucrative vendor fodder if you're after caps.
---
Hell just clearing a workshop nets you 20-ish caps. You'd make far more caps just server hopping and repeatedly clearing a workshop no one wants. 
---
Meanwhile, here I am with 15 Strength, 15 Agility, 15 Endurance.  Barbarian.  Ironclad.  Life Giver.  Refractor.  Elusive.  Dodgy.  Fireproof.  With Scaly Skin and Grounded.  With a full suit of BoS Heavy Vanguard Combat Armor loaded with AP refresh to help with dodgy.
---
And I'm so weak against high level mobs.  They just eat me alive.  This game is terribly balanced that a build loaded up with literally every tanking perk in the game is infinitely weaker than a guy who is running around half-dead all of the time.
---
Only about double the ammo and repair cost also weren’t they supposed to reduce weapon repair costs? Lol cost me like 16 adhesive and springs today and most people with good items like that won’t take caps and good luck looting it
---
Completely agree. 
---
One fix suggestion I saw though was to have trading work like it did in FO4 where you set what you want (and in this case what you’ll charge the other player) and then the trade is done all in one shot once both agree to the terms. 
---
This would allow you to set all the item for item trades to 0, but not have to worry about someone running off with a free item before giving you their end of the trade. 
---
Simple fix for Unyielding- don't let the special bonuses stack. Probably the best way to do it. 
---
according to the UI yes (though I haven't personally tested with or without scaly skin so could be bugged)
---
I got the power fist mod from Phoenix in Wa-toh-gahh
---
Just do a “feed the people” event at the nuka plant that spits outs Nukas as a reward
---
Yes
---
I have the plans if you're on ps4
---
Next we'll get a flood of posts of people CRYING over people crying over tse weapons.
---
If you scrap enough power fist you unlock the mod. Thats how i learned it
---
At +30% damage it's hard to see anyone bothering to carry an enemy-specific legendary. Anti-armor essentially does +29% damage but doesn't multiply with explosive. Bloodied is already stronger at 70% hp. Instigating or Furious should be better situationally, although I'm not sure what Furious actually does.
---
Good thing bloodied weapons are easy to come by😂 
---
Not me, and I'm in power armor 99% of the time
---
So when you’re contesting and claiming and that green outline area around the workshop comes up you don’t actually have to be in that? You can just leave the event and fast travel to someone? Seems like it would stop claiming if you’re not in the marked are I thought
---
You unlock the luck perk called "Super Duper" at lvl 50
---
Try taking off your PA helmet.
---
Sensor Array may be bugged.
---
Worked for me on PS4
---
Can confirm. Still turning in the documents myself in the hopes for more T-60 paint. I have most of the outfits because of it.
---
Hmm true actually lol. Never thought of it that way, I assumed it a 3rd type of aiming. Although when you ads you still see very slight deviation on all weapons of the 2 bullets, and it only gets very obvious with a shotgun.
---
Enemy specific +explosive would be better than tse after the “patch”
---
If you have two day of junk on you, why didn’t you make a stop to drop off your junk? Especially if you were going to go fight some high level enemies. Sounds like you made some bad choices and that level 6 guy reaped the benefits. And now you wanna take your ball and go home. 
---
PvP in FO76 just seems so awkward. I don't even know what to do. I have no interest taking peoples Workshops. Unless they are a group and outnumber me, and are around the same level or higher, then I don't feel like I'm being an asshole too much. I claim workshops and nobody ever bothers me. I guess because a lot of the time I feel like I'm one of the highest levels on the server. Nobody wants to shoot you in this game, because you can just turn around and one shot them. In RDR people just open fire, and then it's on. I generally want to go into town and not be bothered, but when someone does shoot then I'm in the zone. I don't know. It just feels really unsatisfying in FO76. And then  you lose a bunch of caps if you lose a few times. I have pretty good gear so I could go around looking for a fight and probably win a bunch but it's not really in my nature to do that, even if I'm playing an Raider or Outlaw. I'd rather help people than fight them  in general. But I do really like PvP in games where they have good pvp modes like WoW Battlegrounds, or Star Wars Battlefront etc.
---
So much this! 
---
Then just put the hub somewhere else.
---
Such good info that isn't explained anywhere in the game lol
---
Look up the good locations for loot and stop by every now and again. Ammo will suck, but you'll get by.
---
Myself and a friend were clearly a bad influence on a lvl 10 kid. We did a really bad thing giving him a handful of orbitals. He went power mad and totally wrecked some other kid’s base. He made decent bait and he even managed to wreck some lvl 70 guy in PA. 
---
on top of that it should just be nerfed vs players.. not the whole game..
---
In the file labeled “too lazy to add to game”
---
Yup. New meta for solo players.
---
"Oh no......a gulper.....run."
---
"Oh no........a queen......run."
---
"Oh no.......super mutants.......run."
---
"Now I'm out of food and water......oh no.......run."
---
And if you do have enough guns, ammo, stimpaks, and water to stick it out and kill a legendary.......it drops a 1* wood chest piece.
---
If Blizzard could figure it out back in Diablo 2, it's very possible to do it now.
---
 Um, you can.  Both of you put the items in the window for zero caps, both accept. Requires MASSIVE amounts of trust. 
---
Me neither, I got banned earlier on ps4. Wasn't duping either. Has she picked up someone sack that had a lot of items. I mean things like 40+ plans, fluxes, or anything in excessive amount?
---
Dude been farming legendaries for 130+ hours never got a bloodied gun
---
I stopped playing 76 a bit ago, but am keeping up with current events just in case it changes enough to draw me in. A co-op only server would probably do it.
---
I finally got a explosive weapon and it's a flamer... so... explosive fire is a thing too
---
Only thing I could think of that may take the spot is bloodied melee with a fist weapon.
---
I think people are overreacting with the nerf, honestly. I have a TSE and I don’t really mind the nerf; still gonna roll with it.
---
Considering that every PVP experience I have had has been some asshole sneaking up on me and Instant killing me it is really soured my opinions on PVP. It’s just not fun in my opinion and I was lukewarm with the concepts to begin with. Now I feel that it really brings down the game we having to deal with all the crap that comes with it.
---
I meant basic loot for repairs :p
---
I finally got an email saying that my account was flagged due to an “excessively high rate of item creation” but I’m not sure how this is possible. Their explanation is pretty vague so I replied telling them this must be an error. The only things I’ve crafted in excess is ammo and armor to scrap to learn mods. Guess we’ll see where this goes
---
No she bought some bulk steel from someone and armor then got disconnected 
---
YES!
---
Yes,  but we're talking about Bethesda here. They don't have the experience with multiplayer games like Blizzard does. I hope I'm wrong, but the fact that they haven't done anything to remove duped weapons, and have been having issues keeping people from duping in the first place, doesn't give me much confidence.
---
What were you doing at white springs with all your valuable junk, what did you think was going to happen ? Stash and always expect the worst, there is a train station across the road, never enter WhiteSprings with valuable junk
---
What time zone are you in and what hours do you usually play?
---
I don’t plan on changing anything. Instead of one shotting, we’ll be two/three shotting. They’ll still be powerful as hell, second only to bloodied melee, likely. 
---
Yep basically playing the first 40 levels as a gun user except it’s infinite now
---
I thought about this and that's why I asked if someone from Bethesda could reply this as I am very  curious to know.
---
TSE wasn't a problem but "slap damage" was.
---
Some people have fun throwing poo. 
---
They updated the explanation
---

**(UPDATED) Changes to the Two-Shot and Explosive Legendary Mods**: The Two-Shot and Explosive Legendary Mods will be undergoing a few balance changes in this next patch. We know that there has been some frustration over how powerful these mods are, particularly when combined and used in player vs. player combat. With Patch 5, the damage bonus for Two Shot Legendary modded weapons has been reduced from +100% to +25% damag~~e, and the Two Shot legendary mod can no longer be looted in the world~~. The Explosive Legendary mod has a reduced damage bonus, now adding +20% of the base weapon damage with explosive radius damage instead of +100%. **Note:** This was a misunderstanding in what was being addressed with these mods. **They will still be available in the world but are just undergoing some balance changes.** Thank you for your feedback, and we look forward to hearing your thoughts on the changes.
---
JUST NERF IT IN PVP ENCOUNTERS.. NOT IN THE BASE DAMAGE NERF... 
---
I think I'd prefer it if they kept their stuff. Have all the people looking for the PvP experience be able to make the switch easily, leaving the "regular mode" mostly free of the PvP crowd.
---
Maybe have an optional player icon, title or flag for people who start new characters in the new mode, and never go to the "regular" one? Have it there for the people who want the bragging rights of doing it the hard way.
---
Oh gotcha yeah to me it’s more fun to actually play the game than go look for garbage but really have you noticed repair costs it’s insane now?
---
Thanks!  It’s probably multiple specific bugs like that one.  Maybe we can find more pattens?  I’m unarmed build with deathclaw gauntlet, many mutations, mostly in hazmat suit but many crashes in armor too.  First several were traveling to vendors, either crashed just after arriving or 10-20 seconds in, just as I got to the vendor.  Others were random times running around nukesprings.
---
Also three times hit the bug loading in where I could open the map, move it around and place markers, but couldn’t bring up any location menus to select fast travel.  Also could VATS but otherwise no movement or aiming, no buttons including pip boy.  This was permanent and relogging sometimes fixed it.
---
It just be something with the new load-in behavior?
---
So many other crashes though too, and not the typical ones where it’s been laggy for a while.  Just randomly running down an empty street and then disconnect. 
---
 Just like the " Your opinion sucks but I won't provide any ideas of my own" posts.
---
They are nerfing explosive too, but 2 shot definitely deserves the nerf. Like every other dmg boosting legendary mods gives like +30% and just to 1 class of enemy while 2 shot gives +100% to everything so it makes perfect sense to nerf it.  Nice job Bethesda and thanks for the downvotes dupers
---
I have no problem with a TSE nerf. My problem is with the TS nerf and how it basically renders the TS variants of a few weapons as useless as their non-legendary counterparts. 
---
Let me just wait till I'm at 10% health, go into my pipboy, scroll down to Super Stimpak, use, then go back to fighting... fire whoever's idea this was
---
I just had a guy try to do that. Anti Armor and tormentor on a automatic rifle said hello. You can’t sprint if you have no legs. Crit chained his head and said bye bye. Melee is not going to do a damn thing in PvP against good players.
---
All day every day
---
Welding goggles is a common spawn, and monster mask is only obtainable via a exploit, also forgot the giant nose mask
---
Best way to test it is to check damage value&gt;remove Heavy Gunner Card&gt;check damage value for decrease or vice versa.
---
I actually legitimately believed it was supposed to be an inaccessible corridor for all the bots choking it up. I've never been able to pass through it. 
---
This sub usually revolves around people circle jerking over TSE weapons or duping.  The crying will continue.
---
Or take their shit when they die. 
---
I had so much ballistic fiber you motherfucker. 
---
No you have to, but as soon as that is done, they can fast travel to you. It's a real dick move either way.
---
Let me pester you with my melee build for a bit, bring tse in it's current state and will see how balanced it is even before the nerf.
---
THIS ^^^
---
Glad someone finally understands
---
You're sounding pretty judgemental. 
---
That's all they want to hear? Because new events isn't gonna do shit.
---
We need new mechanics and new loot (not legendaries)
---
I think two shot on a weapon like the handmade is perfect, and about as powerful as they should be. However I have a lvl 35 two shot gauss rifle that kills scorchbeast in about 11/12 rounds. And with how easy the ammo is to make I have to force myself not to use it as it can make the game quite boring when you just sneak one shot almost everything.
---
They just need to change which weapons can access these buffs and which ones can't, not just neuter the whole experience.
---
I'm not sure why but I'm compelled to agree with you. 
---
Best solution imo play melee because in what world would a baseball bat beat a gun?🤷🏻‍♂️😂 or uninstall and play the sims
---
I only included them to add to the outfit. I've explained the monster mask to people. And the Faschnacht Man is easy to find 
---
Is that a new thing?
---
That's the one. I'm level 44, so a short wait.
---
Don't know if it's a bug, but that is definitely how it works.
---
Don't have to be in the area and don't need to sneak.
---
If you think this will eliminate Pvp on normal servers you will be very disappointed 
---
Thank you sadly I'm on xbox though
---
Ugh cazadors. Why would you say this? One of my most hated enemies.
---
It will stop claiming, and that in and of itself is also a weapon raiders use.  The PVP state will remain until a fair amount of time has passed or one of you kills the other.  Now what I mean by it being used as a weapon is when players in the midst of their flight or fight response rush back to fight back or claim their junk they do not realize that all the raider needs to do is start the capture process again to flag the both of you for PVP again.  You can and most likely will get farmed for your caps if you are not PVP geared and carelessly run towards a raider employing this tactic.  
---
Its a random event (possibly only shows up after you finish the detector) I did it a few weeks ago up in ash heap.  all it is a timed scorchbeast fight where he's stuck on the ground (so dead in 30 seconds tops)
---
If you are standing still.
---
What happens if you get staggered? 
---
Believe me, when the PvP server drops you aren’t doing that against good players
---
I was pissed off earlier, but you’re right they’re still going to be top of the list for guns. Bloodied melee will be stronger, I think that’s it. 
---
We’ll just have to fire a couple more rounds. 
---
Have you even played? They hit a hard limit of 200. Not only that but loads of items worth over 200 exist, like about half the Plans out there. The bigger barrier there is getting a vendor to pay you even remotely close to the listed value of an object (pretty sure they max out at around 25-30% of value) and the fact that they won't even buy certain items, like Plans.
---
Nice tag. I killed mothman for the first time today at lvl 14. He was lvl 35 but just stood there and stared at me while I pecked him down with my puny weapons.
---
It was up by grafton
---
I hope this is true. I'm taking mine out first thing! Thanks for the info.
---
That was fixed like two patches ago
---
Nah. People want to treat this like some MMO Meta where if you're not the BEST then you're useless. My two shot combat vats rifle (and my new two shot gauss I got today)  will still be viable after the patch,  even without explosive. It just will take a few extra bullets to down things. I'm just hoping with the nerf to two shot that they also lower the recoil penalty/fix the VATS accuracy. 
---
TSE needed a nerf. Had a group farming Queen today and I missed the second one because in the time it took me to upgrade my new gun and run to her,  all of 15 seconds, she was already dead. The main boss in the game shouldn't die in 10-15 seconds. And yep,  it was because a few of them had TSE guns. 
---
Thanks for the info?
---
I love it.  I loved FO4.  
---
Try it.
---
Furious is only meh on slow rof weapons. On guns like the 10mm SMG and anything that shoots fast, its great. 
---
Conversely, Instigating works best on low ROF weapons with high damage for that alpha strike. 
---
The problem is neither two shot nor explosive; its that they exist on the same weapon. 
---
He didn't have those armor effects if that happened. Re-read what I said.
---
Don't worry, after the next patch it will be mostly unkillable.
---
Yeah I know problem is I decided on the unarmed mele build a little late so I haven't gotten makeshift warrior to level 5 yet sadly
---
I think when most people thought of what was op on TSE was the E so them first saying only TS was getting the Nerf rustled people's Jimmie's 
---
Look at Harper's ferry
---
Dupers are getting bans now.
---
Put the mats in your inventory.
---
I always liked the idea that you should just be able to opt in for a 'Real Wanderer' mode or something. You have a higher weight limit, are always engaged in PvP, and don't see other players on the map. Increased EXP too. A sort of hardcore experience that older players and newbies alike can share in...
---
Just fix the issues with armor tearing like tissue paper regularly first, though. That's not a problem of players going out and doing it. It's a problem that they can do it in the first place.
---
A lot of people apparently rely heavily and solely on their TSE weapons.
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
For PvP, the difference between 10 and 15 str is none since both allow you to one-tap another player.
---
Ah, well i haven't seen the plan. Only mods from protectrons but they are rare it might be faster to just get the levels you need to learn the perk cards
---
Neither is the issue. Its both of them together. 
---
I am stockpiling weightless combat armor. I only have 3 pieces but I throw ultra-light on them and they weigh under 2 lbs each. I dont know what I'm going to do with them once I get them cause my main character is a heavy weapon power armor user... but who knows.
---
Weird the queens range attack for me is often blue. Though I'm suspecting that was some kinda winter feature
---
Great story!!
---
No issues. Try defragging your PlayStation.
---
I didn’t even set any points until I was maybe level 25. Cause I knew I’d fuck it up somehow. Guess what? I fucked up somewhat. Lol
---
With your fucking logic you dumb piece of shit (sorry you really make me angry) i made 80$ playing game for like 300 hours.
---
I'm not saying it's fool proof but the stagger doesn't seem to do anything. I've been repeatedly smacked with a deathclaw gauntlet and my dude was staggering all over but still recieving no damage until I moved the toggle. The answer is you have to have a high rate of fire weapon to drain their ap quick enough so dodgy no longer procs.
---
Sorry.
---
no 
---
Every video game there’s always a group of people crying over weapons.  These weapons get nerfed and people find something else to cry about.
---
It's still going to be overpowered lol. They actually did what I suggested like a month ago - those specialized +30% damage boosts are now going to be better than two shot. But they are going to be 1.25x and 1.2x universal bonuses that stack...this will still easily let you reach ridiculous damage. 1.6x damage from the weapon perks, which goes up to 2x with the new two shot. Goes up to 2.4x with the new explosive and 2.8x with max demolition expert. Then you can bring that up to 3.22x with bloody mess. Then go ahead and max it out however you want with adrenaline, tenderizer, drugs, etc. Much less than the current, sure, but it's still great competition. And for once the other effects will actually be useful because two shot has the best universal damage, but other effects will be able to bypass it under certain circumstances
---
Nice encounter but IMO that factory sucks for ammo. That machine takes forever.  With Ammosmith and Super Duper you'll make alot more ammo. They really made the workshops suck. You gotta babysit them every 20 minutes or the npcs take it. 
---
Yes please
---
I want to be able to trade in 3 worthless perl.cards you don't use and take up space in swap time for 1 new one of your choice 
---
Yeah now enemy specific and explosive will be better 🤷🏻‍♂️ good thing I’ve spent like 20K caps on tse
---
Yeah, but the guy with the bat needs to run up to you first. If you engage them at a distance,  as guns are meant to do,  you'd probably drop them before they got to you. 
---
I'm starting to think the same haha thanks for the response though
---
What about TESO?  How has it been doing since launch?  
---
One way to nerf explosive would be to make sure the demolition expert perk doesnt boost the explosive legendary effect.
---
They could also reintroduce old legendary effects (irradiated, cryo, incendary) and maybe new ones (for eg: 'anti tank': bonus damage vs power armor) to make other legendary effects desirable outside of two shot or explosive.
---
Removing the legendary effect/s (whether Two Shot or Explosive) is going too far imo.
---
Wait how do you nerf 2shot? 1.5 shot? I’m actualy being serious this is the first I’ve heard of this.
---
There’s too many opinion posts.
---
Totally agree with you but you forgot the most op build without tse: 15 luck and all the crit perks. You literally 2 shot everything except the SBQ and mirelurk queens
---
If it makes a difference the armor rolls are incredibly rare, same as trying to get a two shot explosive or any combination of two specific effects
---
I just got a quad explosive radium rifle last week and it's far from OP.....as a matter of fact as a solo player it's the first weapon I've gotten that has made the game feel balanced for me. I can now take on a mob of super mutants but it is still far from an easy fight. 
---
There are answers to melee and sentinel/cavalier armor users. Anti armor, staggering, cripple, and crit chaining 
---
It will be fun seing everyone go from 2x durability to broken weapon then just sit and stare st her.
---
Most people support the nerf. Those upset over it are either dupers who were making money off of it or people who spent real money/a ton of caps to buy one (most likely from a duper). 
---
Khatjit has wares if you have coin.
---
Wait..... yes. This would be awesome ? 
---
Ooh, Divide Deathclaws? I like, and I hate.
---
But,hey, at least you don't get another explosive vent...
---
TESO is run by Zenimax, not Bethesda. Bethesda just published it. 
---
waiiittt. there’s a workshop where you can produce unspoilable food?
---
That's prob bobbleheads not TSE 
---
TSE is still gonna be stupid powerful, just potentially not hitting the 1000 damage per second range on some guns like it used to. They should buff the other Legendary effects to match the craziness of TSE...like Vampire healing more, or Medics healing a little with every shot and not just VATS crits.
---
I heard 2 shot is now going to do 25% on the second shot instead of a 100% additional shot
---
I didn't say it would.
---
I think the nerfs for both are quite harsh and percentages maybe need to be reconsidered. My build is full rifle + explosives  + Bloody Mess which require a lot of perk points to fully realize which means I have to go without a lot of QoL perks. Meanwhile, my friend with a melee build dedicated less points into his build and does more armor penetration and damage along with having mutations that greatly affect melee gameplay.  Melee builds playing off low hp to maximize damage can get to the 1000s especially with chems and out damage many TSE without the need of ever having to craft ammo all of the time.
---
My two shot missile launcher does a measly  ~400 damage(will be even less after patch) which is comparative to one swing of some weaker melee weapons. By the time it reloads, a melee build could get in 4-5 swings easily. They also are not weighed down by missile weight which adds up when you carry a decent amount even with the strength weight reducing perk. Maybe base explosives need a buff? In what world should an axe or rifle out damage a missile launcher in one swing or one shot from TSE for example.  My rifle already doubles if not quadruples the DPS of the launcher.
---
&gt; Melee? Lol gtfo. Some dude kills me w melee once then I seek revenge and destroy them, multiple times, from range. IT'S REALLY NOT THAT HARD.
---
Use a laser rifle then.
---
No, not even the powerfist.
---
My kid uses a shot gun and only plays on weekends mostly so I save all the excess ammo I get for him. There's no way you can get banned for ammo. 
---
Hell just crafting with the super duper and ammo smith perk gets me about 3k ammo for my own gun. 
---
I see this pretty consistently on PC
---
That makes a lot more sense then. 
---
This is great. I am now looking forward to the PvP server!
---
I didn't want to say it so explicitly but yea I think exactly the same
---
Well the thing is as far as pvp is concerned if I were to shoot someone using a bat they could walk up to me taking almost no damage and the initiate damage on me and I’d have to try and shoot them w/out killing myself or get one shotted by the bat if mobs are concerned they’re shitty shots hardly do any damage and most good melee builds decimate them easily while not having to waste bullets 
---
Yet, we're talking about PvP, since that's what the devs are trying to balance around. And the lower damage from lack of legendary armor won't stop them one-tapping players.
---
after working in construction for one summer and literally never again in my life i think it's just the type of concrete mix. IIRC it's quick setting so it's good for time sensitive projects. No idea what the numbers mean. I never actually worked with that kinda stuff, mostly just hauled shit for demolitions
---
I respect your opinion buck the fact that I can literally 1-3 shot anything but scorchbeasts is sketchy...
---
So I can have all the perks for melee in one deck and all perks for heavy weapons in another deck that I can switch to under seconds? This is better than having to make hard choices in choosing either going melee or ranged. Bethesda please hire this man. 
---
yeah that would be cool, basically we just need a way to get more nuka colas efficiently 
---
&gt; Furious is only meh on slow rof weapons.
---
I've got a furious .50 cal and its still pretty meh. Solid choice for SBQ but outside that one scenario it's not a good choice. I prefer my bloodied gatling in almost all situations.
---
Instigating on the other hand is fucking fantastic for the right weapons.
---
The problem is **absolutely** explosive. It's far too strong for a non primary affix end of story. If TS didn't get a nerf and explosive was changed to just turn damage AoE instead of also giving a damage buff, then everything would be fine.
---
Yeah but there’s gotta be a maximum at which point it’s suspicious
---
They going to be nerfed becouse crybabies, Congrats. Now we have to kill Scorchbeast queens with rooling pins.  Thats why everyone died before they let us out, selfish crybabies. (haha, lets find new meta)
---
Cuz, like, it's fun!
---
I'm hoping the new PvP option will fix that for people who want to PvP. 
---
Scratch that, has happened 4 times since this. 
---
Energy weapons are still shit.
---
I've definitely been both crippled (both legs and one arm) and still taken no damage, also the stagger, not sure if it's a bug or something, doesn't seem to do anything other than knock you around, it drains ap and when out of ap you will take damage but I've been bashed around and just stood there then point blank explosive round, downed the guy and was still standing after.
---
I have to agree but if they removed the ability to stack effects on bobbleheads which is easy to do that would solve alot of problems 
---
Most people don’t lol I’d prefer solo servers😂
---
Make sure to craft a higher level garb ;$
---
You and maybe Bethesda. Let me dream 
---
&gt; Stimpacks are not always instant heal.
---
I know they're not, but they stack. Having loads of dilluted and more healing from stimpack perk and you become incredibly hard to take down if the ranged user can't out DPS your heals.
---
I'm also hoping for private/pve servers. :P
---
I said some weapons, sadly radium is not one of them. It was mainly best for those that have low magazine size. I feel you, bullet sponges are annoying. But yeah my point was that tse was not objectively better at all times.
---
Thanks, don’t have it though. 
---
Plight of the Gatling plasma 
---
Yeah they will, they then won't be able to ban you for using mods when instead they want you to have to play the game more since you wasted some caps you spend time acquiring.
---
I don’t think you know how programming works with Bethesda games. Not to be a dick or anything but he’s right it’s not gonna happen
---
No, there have not been enough posts crying about this to raise a concern.  Thank you for your time.
---
Honestly I wish this game was crazy hard. I’ve said from the beginning that it needs more of the survival element from the dead money DLC from new Vegas. That shit was so difficult but so satisfying 
---
Yeah kind of wish it would have come earlier I probs won’t play this game too much in the future
---
This. Except call it "Nuke the People."
---
Doesn't happen to me. Just unmodded legs only. 
---
These snarky comments back at people being rude are exactly why I come here. Lol 😁
---
I've had all parts unequip at random from all types of Power Armor (mostly T-60) from...I guess fast traveling? I haven't paid that much attention to it but it is usually when I enter/exit areas I think.
---
This would actually be really cool for the magazine stand I could stack all my tales from the Virginia hills comics  
---
Not only have I gotten Rusty Knuckles from literally everyone one of my queen kills (except my last, where I got explosive vents), but O just got a Rusty Knuckles drop from a *regular* scorchbeast. Because fuck me, right?
---
Thanks for the reply 
---
If easy to find negates them being able to be on here the bos jumpsuit and almost every bos anything is easy to find, the responders paramedic is a guareed quest reward, you can server hop fort defiance for the straight jacket and every clean apparel has a chance of spawning in a robot that has a guaranteed spawn location even if he doesn't allways spawn
---
Its not though. I have an explosive handmade and it feels perfectly fine. Not OP; takes 8-11 shots per glowing one *with* the glowing enemy damage boost. 
---
That, compared to a furious 10mm that takes about 30 rounds to kill a glowing one seems pretty balanced to me. My double barrel takes less shots than the explosive handmade and its not explosive nor two shot. 8 shots max. 
---
The explosive perks and fact that two shot and explosive can be on the same weapon are the problem. Not one nor the other. 
---
This happens so often, does it warrant an AMA? 
---
That's the point of the games though. Spend the first 30% beining under powerd. Spend 30% on an even footing, spend last 40% and end game stomping giants into the ground with your pinky finger. So much better than those games with constantly scaling enemies so you never get ahead (looking at you, The Division) 
---
Red dead 2 is absolute garbage. Campaign is great, multiplayer is a circle jerk with no happy ending.
---
If rockstar wasn't so greedy they would have had poker right from the start, now we have to wait for lawyers to decide if it's even legal because of in game currencies being purchasable from the store.
---
I like the idea of a market. It should be somewhere else. We are supposed to be rebuilding. There should be a place that is a shared camp with the market. The new city we are building. We could put camps around it and it would look like a city.
---
They might as well name it 1.25 shot explosive now
---
1.25 shot
---
You have the BOS jumpsuit?
---
I've gotten a few of those. Also gotten some prime receivers...  
---
Still trying for Ultracite Helmet plans. 
---
Yeah but you can get some calibrated shocks on each leg. +50 per leg, which in your case could be applied to both your Ultracite and Excavator...
---
This would give your Excavator +200 capacity and your Ultracite +100 capacity. 
---
PM me if you need help brother
---
not atoms. not atoms.
---
Yeah. I did the same thing. Wasted so many perk points at lower levels for no reason because I wasn't sure what I wanted my build to be. Now I'm trying to slowly get all the crafting perks I need for maintenance of my equipment and ammo creation
---
This was a cool story.
---
Admit you would use it to maintain discipline
---
yes the system sucks it should show the total wieght of a stack or at least an option for it
---
Holy fuck
---
That makes server hopping only more boring. You only have an hour and you’re sitting threw extra loading screans and extra waiting instead of playing 
---
Look another TSE post.
---
PS4: Still getting blue screen. It's very annoying. 
---
Link?
---
My helmet kept unequipping. I'd reequip it, it wouldn't change. I thought it might be the mod. Made another helmet, same thing. Now it's glitching the other way.
---
Hm ok thank you for the input -- I wonder if its b/c of the mods.
---
did someone say Grafton Day!?
---
Time to fight the grafton monster for the 2,896,302^th time.
---
also, has anyone else seen him as low as the nuka cola plant? Like what the fuck are you doing down here?
---
Well we can’t play more than a 20 minute session but good news even if you can survive disconnect no one will be able to kill the queen soon anyway😂
---
Plenty of ammo for crossbows.  You get a bunch back and if you’re patient and out of resources to craft you can just bash a dead body over and over with the crossbow to get more bolts
---
God no
---
Ah ok I guess its not just the Excavator then.  Good to know, thank you!
---
Another TSE post.
---
They should add in a weight counter for the sum one stack
---
I did forget to take a screenshot, sorry. I will if I can possibly remember tmorrow
---
Yes report them.
---
Not really, play, log out, log back, new server, same zone. It's like groundhog day.
---
Dude could've just made that for his friend. 
---
He had all of that because he showed me. Then accused me of bobblehead stacking. I showed him my build and my weapon, which apparently to him and his friends is “top tier”. 
---
I run a VATS crit chain commando stealth build with a AA explosive Handmade automatic. 
---
This - would make it much easier to spot what is weighting down my stash with a glance 
---
Sorry, learn to stash your junk. 
---
This guy
---
U hv to be lvl 15-25 and then u can find them them at watogo and harpers ferry vendor
---
So I'm defending criminals if I think taking just a few minutes to learn how to make a safe online game environment is important?
---
I mean if we want to continue this metaphor, theres a reason you cant just walk into a jewelry store and take things from it for free with no repercussions. Theres a reason why you cant steal something and then give the stolen goods to your friend and that friend is off the hook.
---
YES of course these things are bad. However it doesn't take rocket science to figure out the basic code needed to prevent these things. Nerfing a weapon in the midst of the dev room being fully visible STILL to this day is absolutely inexcusable. It takes less than a second to just remove a dev room unless their code is so horrible they cant just comment it out. It's still there. It seems like they WANT people to continue to do this if they're not even gonna attempt to stop anyone.
---
Excellent comment.
---
8,000 fuel ? maybe cause i don’t craft my own ammo but 8,000 for one guy just seems crazy 
---
I wish we could get Vault-Tec as a faction with vendors, that would be a new one that would work well with vaults opening! Plus, if I had to pick a side it would Vault-Tec, for we are all slaves to them and owe them our lives.
---
Whatever glitch she has means quite often I can’t even kill her now. 
---
Same here. Just turned 37 last month.
---
You will be invisible to other players.
---
While understandable, it could lead to complications ( or a great time depending on if you like being the only one on a server or not) as it could force alot more servers to be open with only one or two players on it at a time. Meaning there  could be 100 full servers with 135 servers with 1-4 people on it. I don't disagree with you, I hate having to log in and out and end up on the same EXACT server 5 times, but I do understand why it's not a thing.
---
Visit each Vendor from different factions
---
At that same area in Harper’s Ferry, if you look down from that level 3 safe into the demolished building, there is a blown-out kitchen. The damaged fridge has 1-2 rare drugs and the damaged oven across from it has a food recipe inside the oven
---
It does now since the new update. Check it out the next time you level up. Each rank adds 15% explosive resistance up to 45% at rank 3. I didn't know about dense working well with it though until I came here. Is there a mod like dense for power armor? I don't think there is. I still blow myself up with my auto grenade launcher when I fire on enemies that are somewhat close, even with all three ranks
---
Thats witch hunting!
---
I have 2 pieces of sentinel and can definitely notice a difference if I get staggered
---
There is some really odd balancing that the game does. I killed a level 45 when I was 15. He was wanted so I shot. When I saw his life drop I was surprised. Even more so when I got the kill. 
---
That worked! Thank you!
---
8000 isn't out of the question for a regular person.  I make 5k .50 all the time by killing mutants and mining lead.
---
Kinda a dick move on your part.
---
Crazy, this is exactly what is happening to me too right now.
---
Report &amp; let Bethesda sort it out. If they're legit players, they shouldn't be punished.
---
Though who knows with this Bethesda... 
---
I have 70k shotgun shells which i have bought from lots of people. U calling me a duper also?
---
I've actually got two legitmatiely farmed two shots- a combat rifle I bought off a vendor a while back (no clue why someone sold it as it was three stars with better VATS accuracy and lower ap cost) and a two shot Gauss I just got off the SBQ today. It's going to suck losing the double damage, but I can deal with a blanket 25% damage increase without too many penalties. If they fix the VATS accuracy issues, even better. 
---
I agree 100%.
---
I'm sure a TSE radium is pretty lethal but 20 shots goes quickly. I like my quad with 80 rounds.
---
I did somehow find a TSE mini gun at a vendor yesterday  which is pretty OP but it breaks pretty quickly. 
---
I have an explosive shotgun which is lethal even to me if I'm too close to a wall or car. I'd say the range is what needs to be nerfed on that, because it's basically a rifle right now, but as far as damage bits a high risk weapon if you have a ghoul rushing in your face.
---
I can’t fully confirm, but my suspicion is that plants and water purifiers fill sequentially, not concurrently and based on your production amount. 
---
Also, each purifier/resource collector has a weight limit limiting the amount of whatever item it collects that can be in it at any given time. 
---
Same I used to kill her easy but recently 3000 rounds from a tse prime handmade I didn’t even get her to half health where she heals wtf? Also having problems killing regular enemies with explosive weapons again
---
Yes. Ammosmith+Super duper=easy. 
---
A lot of players drop stuff in suitcases at white springs Watoga Station and Flat woods overseer cache. 
---
I have a 10mm SMG exploding gun. It's lots of fun to use, sounds great, but just doesn't really do that much damage. I would call it a very group friendly weapon though as you can tag monsters and let others get xp and loot too. :)
---
Same longest session was 15 minutes
---
Knowing bethesda they recycled the mechanic for skyrim
---
He clearly says we will NOT be forced to interact with other players.
---
A: https://youtu.be/4IDLGUO7zXk?t=2854
---
Pretty sure if they aim at you they see your name
---
That’s reasonable, The only thing I have with that is when I do server hop it’s never to an empty server. Leading me to believe it could be done. 
---
I thought it was only the explosive damage was getting nerfed.
---
Pretty sure I do I have like 20 of every "rare" bos thing you mentioned from farming the PA paint. So I would be shocked if I didn't.
---
I can understand the explosive nerf but 2shot needs to be left alone.  The accuracy loss is a significant tradeoff to keep it balanced.  As for the "+30% vs X", theyre only bad necause the damage buff is far too low.  "Double damage vs. X" would have been more appropriate. 
---
I don't give the game a chance to do all of that. After one crash I'm done. Don't care to play and get disconnected or crash at some moment when it's going to annoy the hell out of me. Think I'm gonna take some time off from this game until they get the crashes fixed, though usually when I do stop playing a game, some other game will catch my interest and the old one is forgotten.
---
You can get the plans from the event at the penitentiary.
---
As much as I like the general idea you're proposing I do have problems with congregating all of the game's high level players right next to the starting area.  
---
It'd be like if Northshire Abbey or The Valley of Trials in WoW was infested with max level players, except the high level players might either drop a tonne of materials, weapons and armor for you or spend the next hour following you around dropping Mini-nukes and Orbital Strike Beacons on you.  
---
I do like the general idea though. I'd like to think the main player area would be somewhere around Watoga. It's theoretically the "End game" zone with it's proximity to the Prime Fissure. And we could also tie it to the "Mayor for a day" thing - where one player in the area is genuinely mayor for a day.
---
Yep ever since that bit of sever maintenance it’s the first time I’ve had real sever issues 
---
This shit is why I don't even bother with this game.
---
Everyone has a different idea of rare, never said it was a perfect list, sorry to offend you. Post a picture of you in the BOS jumpsuit
---
Nice! Wheres a good place to farm the weapon itself?
---
Lol punish people for playing this game that’s punishment in itself 😂
---
because modders can do it bethesda has no excuse: is not a valid argument. example modders might be able to make the game have better graphics and run just as smoothly . However conditions can change so drastically or even just be so specific that it effects everybody regardless of choice or autonomy or whatever.
---
but um other than that, great point on the thread, or maybe some sort of encyclopedic perception of your own knowledge. but there is a huge gap in knowledge as soon as I switch characters and have to remember that sprites personal journey.
---
My dude I don’t wanna float but I just got an armor piercing legendary hunting rifle. It was like the last ghoul of the last second of nuked whitesprings. This rng game man fuck. 
---
Happens to me a ton, but not with a specific leg. Instead it'll start happening with a couple random parts and then consistently unequip them every time I get into my PA, or come out of a loading screen (very frustrating when fast traveling into somewhere dangerous). Usually persists till I stop playing, but starts up again randomly. Have had it happen in my T-51 as well, and with like every different body part.
---
You'all knew the nerfs were coming. Why you did this, when it was obvious is beyond me.
---
Invisible to players as well as your name is also removed making you completely invisible. There was a wanted guy on my server earlier. Wasn’t much and he was a low level probly accidentally hit a workshop turret or something as he was right near some one else’s workshop so I went over to get rid of his bounty for him but when I got to where he was I couldn’t find him but I knew he was there I was looking all around I heard him slowly creeping so I kept listening eventually I shot a wall with my TSE shotgun in the direction I thought he was and it killed him i never saw a shimmer or name tag and barely heard him if he  wasn’t wanted I’d never have know he was ever there that build will be broken when pvp servers get released.  
---
I bet you feel dumb right now.
---
I was level 22 found handmade plans on Grahm
---
What if I have a friend who's just started playing and I can't meet them outside Vault 76?  
---
If you've played WoW you know how irritating instanced zones can be when you're trying to meet people or help a friend.
---
Not really a way to farm it bec it has no set spawn location. Build the weapon then scrap it. Its the best way to get mods
---
Top Of The World would make a better one though.
---
It already was clearly a hub and shopping store post-war before hand.
---
Have the access require a quest, like getting the Tower back in Destiny 2; and have it be a hub you join that has it's own server separate from the game world, so there are always people.
---
Maybe we just average out then. I've seen rusty knuckles once and otherwise it's always explosive vents. Except for last night when she dropped 4 fusion cells, 4 throwing knives, and nothing else.
---
Congratulations, you just raised everyone's eyebrows at Bethesda. 
---
Also, just to note, if this comes to the atom shop. I would make an atom purchase to get this.
---
*Hint, Hint, Bethesda *
---
eh, it’s not super hard to make ammo. It’s costly, but with ammosmith, depending on the type, you can make oodles of it with no effort.
---
You can always report someone if you think it’s necessary, but Bethesda will always ask for visual proof above all else, so then taking action is unlikely either way.
---
Not really. I’ve “bought” tons of stuff from the Atom Shop and have yet to spend a single penny. 
---
It should suppress your own mutations too, if you have any.
---
Not sure about other models but the X-01 has arm mods that boost unarmed damage. Rusty knuckles, Tesla bracers, and hydraulic bracers.
---
My god pleass yes
---
I usually dump all the ~~trash~~ amazing 1* legendary items from farming a nuke zone in that little bag beside the door to the whitespring station.  Always check around the are during a nuke. &lt;3
---
Both are being nerfed 75% damage reduction on TS, 80% damage reduction on explosive 
---
Cotton eye joe? 
---
No mods beyond the stealth effect
---
Yea those are the risks of them tse shotty.
---
So, basically the only way to make an energy weapon good (Two-Shot) is not being effectively removed.
---
Great.
---
Fucking fix your god damn energy weapons, you've been pissing on them since Fallout 3.
---
8000 fuel isn’t even that much considering how fast it goes through. LOL they were probably legit and you just ruined their night.
---
How it worked in Fallout 4 was that the second shot was only ever base damage with no modifier from perks. So I think this is actually still more powerful on average. 
---
This smacks of someone who doesn't know wtf they're talking about. You're looking at this through a narrow scope of what you've experienced rather than whats possible and whats available.
---
So then let me explain why explosive is broke compared to other traits. It is not a primary Affix. In other words an affix that doubles the damage of your weapon **and** makes it aoe, shares its affix slots with other "powerhouses" such as 25% increased rate of fire, 50% limb damage and vats crits do 50% damage.
---
In other words it's more than twice as strong as the next best options in that tier of legendary mods and most of those require you to jump through major hoops to use such as the vats crits. Explosive is double damage and AoE **all the time with no drawbacks**.
---
Essentially what I'm saying is you're not wrong, but you're not right either. It's not the fact that TS and explosive can be on the same weapon at the same time, it's the fact that explosive is as strong as it is **AND** in the ["major" category](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects) of legendary mods rather than primary.
---
**Absolutely** explosive is too strong once you consider where/how it slots into a weapon. TS is fine imo, but other legendary mods are garbage. They should be buffing other primary mods instead of nerfing TS.
---
Your problem is that your comparing a secondary mod to other primary mods and you probably don't even realize it. That's how strong explosive is.
---
Also, an explosive shotgun right now, is substantially stronger than almost any other weapon in the game. They're fucking ridiculous and it doesn't need the TS affix to be that way. My friend has one and can 2 shot scorch beasts. My instigating sledge hammer that's sitting at 600 damage doesn't do as much damage even on the first swing and my sledge only hits that hard on the first swing.
---
You didn't already have enough? 
---
Max I would do is 50%
---
Not a duper...but you MAY have hoarding problems...
---
8000 fuel for me now 😎 i have his gt so i could fork it over if i want 
---
That i can admit 😂😂
---
Good one 😁
---
The final nail in the coffin lol
---
Dang that was shitty of you flamer fuel is not hard to make just crap it only gives you 9 per craft but only takes a few oil so if you have an oil extractor for your base you can easy have 10k fuel one of my low level friends like the flamer is doing this whole charisma team medic with a flamer build to help support me even tho I don’t need it at all being lvl 190 him being 25 but he is a young kid. me and his dad play often and he tags along and it’s great fun so I always craft a lot and save all the fuel I find and give it to him. At this point your the one that should be reported. Making assumptions and stealing items. 
---
Yeah but you can just drop them.
---
This.
---
And this.
---
If you're worried about coming back into the exact same server 5 times when re-logging, try just opening the Social Menu and hopping directly to a friend's server. Saves time and is guaranteed not to bring you back to the same place.
---
Are you on PS4 by any chance and it was some level 300 guy in the mask?
---
my fuel now 😎 must’ve hit a nerve huh ? 
---
Damn, nice bro. The only legendaries I seem to get at the Whitesprings or wherever are armor pieces which are completely useless to me. Guess I'll have to keep playing the waiting game haha
---
no on xbox, he want even close to lvl 300
---
Yeah brother. You need shocks in your life 
---
[https://i.imgur.com/rDJWv5E.gifv](https://i.imgur.com/rDJWv5E.gifv)
---
Ah, because I literally just got out of a game with some asshat in a mask that was able to oneshot me with his TSE shotgun. Outside combat too.
---
It's clearly pay to win. I just don't know what I would do with -2 perception. Except maybe miss these great offers in the atomic shop. You need to be very perceptive to keep an eye on those limited time offers.
---
Lol so you bought a duped weapon from a vendor...
---
how does that relate to this ?
---
Or top of the world, or anywhere. We thought there'd be player hubs. We thought we'd be able to build our settlements together. (joining them together)... it's kind of lonely out there. No where to really congregate other than WS and no one wants to 'hang out' there, there's nothign to do
---
Doing a big event?  Have a msg pop up for other players in the game world that it's happening and a player could need your help etc.  Make the cost to goto the event minimal or free.  Make the rewards good enough that people will want to go.  You will see lots of people banding together to do the event.  So far the most fun I've had during events was when I noticed more than 1 other person already in the area starting it so that when I joined up, it was a bunch of us kicking butt together!  I like solo'ing through the wilderness but this kind of thing breaks up the monotony sometimes.  If I see a nearby event start or it auto loads into my pip-boy but there is nobody else there, I'll usually just cancel it in my pip-boy and carry on.
---
Yep...I have a level 34 TS Lever Action that was my main weapon and this is really disappointing. I get nerfing it, but 75% is a pretty steep decrease.
---
Keep blowing up emails. Looks like a banwave to me.
---
Yeh its not worth the resources but damn sure is for the pvp.
---
These are always my fave encounters. Ive made many friends (and enemies) this way in all games. Funny how fighting can bring people together sometimes 😂
---
At any level?
---
Was attacked by lvl 65 glowing MothMan at level 20 and the nearest sentry bot wrecked my house and the MothMan wrecked me but I eventually killed it. Turrets did not help 😕
---
Getting people to come to the hub require a resource that they can only get there. In this case it is the auction house.
---
Players will always want to trade, buy and sell items. Giving them an in-game system to browse and post items for sale would attract a lot of people. 
---
Then after a while give people a CAMP item that allows them to view the current auctions but they cannot do anything else. That way they can check the market anytime but have to go to the hub to buy it.
---
Maybe have the vendors at the Hub have static items for sale but the items rotate daily so people will come to check the daily inventory. Each vendor would have a small chance to have a rare item for sale as they would have access to almost all items in game.
---
Keep blowing up emails, looks like a banwave.
---
Sorry, I'm on PC but yeah, PA is stupid clunky but for me the advantages outweigh the ruined stealth. I've never actually played stealthy so I've never experienced proper stealth and don't actually know how close you can get to enemies without PA and the right perks. 
---
Sadly, I'm a loner on PC. No friends XD
---
Good to know!
---
And here I thought you meant a skin for your power armour, so you can stomp around the wasteland like a Dynobot. 
---
The thing is, no one 'hangs out' at WS, really. And the vendors hvae pretty much the same plans inside WS. There's all that space, all that beautiful artwork made by some meticulous game devs and ... nothing to do really. Imagine if you could put a player vending machine in that building and sell YOUR stuff. Anything you want to sell. People would be in there all day hanging out and meeting each other. 
---
I'm at work atm or I would check
---
Ahh, ya fair. I didn't really have any PSN friends until I started making Reddit trades, and now I have a small list that mostly just gets used to make server hopping a little smoother lol
---
I stopped reading after the first sentence. You dont insult someone as your first step in a discussion. 
---
The combination of 2 shot *and* explosive together is the problem. The problem is not two shot and the problem is not explosive. That is final. 
---
I don't know if it was duped or not. Heck, I didn't even know there was a duping problem back when I bought it (about two weeks after the game came out).  It was on a vendor and it was the only legendary on there. Figured someone was just an idiot. It wasn't even an explosive weapon. 
---
Melee, heavy weapons, pistols and explosives all have a weight reduction perk.  It's only our 25lb rifles that have no means of mitigation.
---
And this all cost me a bunch of bulk springs and gears....
---
I’m seriously not happy with Bethesda. I don’t even know why I deal with the aggravation 
---
Not suggesting we hide away more like turn V76 into a player Supermarket.  
---
It actually replaces the flame with an explosive projectile. So an explosive flamer is basically an explosive minigun that lights things on fire. I actually think it's a really good gun as a result.... It's just a pain in the ass get fuel for it.
---
Bloodied goes up to 80%.
---
Yep. 
---
No 
---
Damn, too rich for me!
---
Lol okay, you're a fucking idiot, thank you for making that clear.
---
I believe so. It's random though, so you might have to run it a couple of times.
---
Yea but then repeat because stuffs not there. 20 mins later you’re playing
---
I’m glad that’s one stability issue that’s been fixed. I used to always freeze when trying to join a friend from the social menu when already on a world. 
---
Awesome sounds good, happen to have an extra set of the Brotherhood Fatigues for sale? Not the under armor
---
Sorta make it like the tower in destiny, a big ol social hub where you can mess around, access shops, exchange things for rewards, find sneaksy little secrets. I dont even play fo76 and I think this is an amazing idea.
---
I think it's a great product that needs some work. I have faith that it'll get there. I've got hundreds of hours and it's well worth the full price I paid, bugs and all. 
---
I simply don't believe you.
---
Unless you do sqb with 5+ ppl doing zero damage you shouldn't need that much ammo.
---
Happened to me too I just server hoped twice
---
Awesome. Thanks for the tip 
---
That's very kind of you 🤗
---
They fill up randomly at 12/hr (one every 5 minutes into a random purifier) no matter how many you have. More purifiers is more storage, not faster production.
---
Give it a rest seriously...TSE weapons will still be the best overall Legendaries. 
---
I believe they should use the Auction House system that runescape used.
---
I would pay a lot of caps for my own room.
---
Wow your such an edgy badass when youre safe behind that keyboard. Please dont put me in a caps lock. 
---
Plus they promised that things from the Atom Shop would only be cosmetic items. Nothing that gives you any boosts of any kind.
---
Ya but it would be free to fast travel to V76 and free to travel back to your CAMP. So cost you nothing to hop over and take a look at Auction house, grab a couple daily missions, put a couple Legendaries up for trade, then pop back to your CAMP.
---
I wasnt gripping about your complaints. just pointing out it is a common thing in online games XD
---
Exactly. TSE alone doesnt kill it that fast.
---
I guess I never realized cause I mostly use rifles haha been just dealing with the weight . Foudn good legendary armor that reduces weight but it doesn't help in power armor  
---
Seems fair, considering asshats just one shot her the moment she spawns anyways.
---
Lol no idc what you do I always trade for that reason but assuming some one is duping is wrong as I’ve been accused of it because I’m a high level player and have an explosive Gatling gun. I have farmed every weapon I have and ignorant players reporting others for duping is garbage especially with Bethesda dropping the ban hammer so freely. 
---
My concern in that post was more to the fact that player vending machines, if placed in camp, wouldn’t get any traffic in places off the beaten path. 
---
Honestly there's never been a moment where I had to gitgud. The hardest difficulty in God of War was brutal but fulfilling. This game never teases at testing the user, we're practically gods.
---
Oh, okay, I didn't know that would work! Thanks for the tip!
---
Oh sweet! Thanks!
---
Last i checked cobbler and juice didn't stack... juice and relish will?
---
Are you running bloodied?
---
When buffs run out that give hp it takes the hp away
---
That hardly increases your damage. Its not great having powerful unarmed weapons and not being able to use them in power armour.
---
Only happens to me when I exit the Excavtor PA, fixs when I relog
---
You're not completely invisible. you get that wibbley shimmer look like predator in the movies.
---
I can see someone doing that, it's nice that people will leave stuff for others though.
---
I would love to see Vault 76 become kind of a Tower of sorts. Having a Mr. Handy that fetches lost loot would be nice(like the Postmaster), a Mr. Gutsy that gives out Carnage Missions(Kill X of Y enemy Faction or animal type), or a Protectron in Vault-Tec colors that sold gear would be nice additions to the game.
---
You on PS? I've got spare helm plans
---
Actual unarmed doesn't work in pa.
---
Only the mods do
---
Why does the rng suck so bad? Do they hate the players? Is there a good reason? 
---
Ya this hanging out hub is what I find I miss the most in current Fo76.
---
Targetting HUD maybe?
---
I would like to add something else, choose to turn the items you want to display into a decoration. It'll render the item useless and occupy storage but can be placed.
---
Mole Rats and Radscorpions would find a way.
---
That's specific to that enemy. What about overall? 
---
He (Assuming its a he) has played for 850 Hours and hours between the today and release are 1632 hours. So he's been playing for 12 hours a day every day since release. He's got an addiction. 
---
Sneaky/Heavy/Melee are still really strong, not TSE strong but nothing is TSE strong because it's stupid OP.
---

Searching containers (Y button) delayed effect, doesn't seem to work on empty containers anymore. 
---
Sadly not many choices for power armor fisting.
---
Sadly they shoehorned in what they could.
---
Most likely the check on the server happens once a server is found.
---
1 login polling all servers for an empty spot would shit on the already shitty netcode
---
Why the hell would he be trying to trade while under attack?  Should have went and used the stash just off to his right. 
---
Luck stat is 5 for Class freak maxed and scrounger 2 for ammo or Pharma for meds.
---
I switch that out for Starched Genes if I’m about to hit the radaway.
---
Except we have a malfunctioning GECK in Vault 94 running wild that caused The Mire to become The Mire. 
---
Damn. Now Fireproof doesn't make sense as a  Perk. 
---
I would like better rewards with higher difficulty and probability to fail.
---
They just announced that they are going to Nerf all of the good weapons in the game.
---
Wood chest pieces are now going to be pretty good drops compared to getting a crappy two shot or an explosive gun.
---
Ok, screw the gauntlet. I want this. 
---
Since the update I’ve had one and only after logging out and back in quickly in an attempt to fix the friendlist glitch.
---
[Here you seee me hunting guy with bounty, he have chameleon.](https://youtu.be/o1yR4rUAhyY?t=101)
---
This would be an awesome concept. Like the social hubs in Destiny. You could access the atomic shop from there and do any upgrading or repairs at work benches too.
---
You're spot on. Definitely by level 90 I had all of the cards for my core build as well as all the utility perks that I felt I had a use for. Finally, the other day, at around 110, I decided to add some mutations which meant taking starched genes and class freak, spending a few more levels on low level cards so I could swap out max rank versions, and 5 more levels to shift points to Luck. And I still have more than 10 levels left to spend.
---
In order to download this 3.5 GB update, I had to open up 65 GB of data on my PS4. Seems pretty ridiculous. So I need 130 GB reserved for this one game and its updates?
---
Sorry this reply is so late, but I got Medium generator first, from what I assume would have been a Workshop, and I know for a fact that I got Windmill next from a Workshop. Fusion was the only one i got from Poseidon and now that i have it, I don't care about getting the Large. 
---
Having those others previously unlocked may be why Poseidon gave me the Fusion. 
---
Happens to me as well. You are not alone dude. It’s super annoying when you’re gathering junk.
---
Maybe access to a Account wide Stash separate to Character Stash.
---
So you have the Character Stash with 600. Then you hop over to V76 and access the Account wide 1200 stash.  Any character on you account would be able to take from the Stash.
---
Would that work you think?
---
Most guns need a buff in general. This is part of the reason why two-shot doesn't seem so powerful, it's because this is how powerful guns should be in the first place. However when you compare two-shot to other legendary effects a flat +25% damage bonus is plenty my friend.
---
Look I'm not the one who's incapable of reading a few paragraphs and trying to understand how an argument works. All you've done is tell me I'm wrong, then when I explain things you tell me I'm explaining myself wrong. Be an adult and get treated like an adult or behave like a child and get berated like one. Your choice.
---
Cool, time to cop
---
There's toooons of story. Have you played the game? Serious question. Because I'm baffled that you could play the game and claim there's no story. 
---
YES! WHY are there SO many damn energy weapons in these games and NOBODY uses them hardly? I mean well yeah GUASS and all but who the fuck uses laser weapons? Yet they are so prolific. MAKE THEM USABLE FFS
---
Love watching all the tears from butthurt players who cant use sh!t and revert to TSE in pvp everytime.
---
Or cool depending on your style
---
*Khajiit. Has. Wares. If you. Have. Coin. Ha. Ha. Ha. Gotcha. Responder.*
---
Because youtubers a month ago told everyone melee is the best and to prove them wrong tse was used alot.
---
After the nerf once again ppl will have to prove them wrong.
---
Simply put ppl can't think for themselves and blindly parrot each other.
---
Just like the trade exploit hoax
---
Just like the stacked bobblehead 1 shotting thru pacifist mode hoax
---
whats the change? I havent played in a while but i have a legit TSE .50 cal and i enjoyed the feel of firing it. it is getting nerfed to the ground or something?
---
The one guy I roll with uses chameleon a lot, I can't see him except for the glimmer unless we're teamed up, then I see his name and the yellow arrow.
---
Gotta get all the  \~\~meme\~\~ pipe weapons!
---
I bought the tricentennial edition and I play everyday. 200 hrs in!
---
Not really, especially considering how common some ammo types are.
---
To me it also includes players who wouldn't get anywhere without them. Love the tears.
---
I fail to see the connection 
---
That should not be a problem as the robots in the Vault are loyal to Vault tec. You just altered their sub-routines and made their "Profession" Merchant.
---
So everything should drop the best gear always?
---
That make you bored Quick :)
---
Make them have some cost and be able to be added to the wheel on consoles. Limit the number or lock them in at the start of PvP to prevent hotswapping in the middle of combat to adapt to another player’s combat style (for example don’t have blocker on current deck, see opponent uses melee, switch to deck with lvl 3 blocker after the shaft of combat). 
---
The man wants to do what the man wants to do. It's fun for him. The game is a sandbox.
---
Yeah it seems so simple I really think it could be a possibility.
---
It's really clunky and discouraging because of the slap system and nonsense they put in to try and avoid people fighting...strikes me if they didn't truly want it then they shouldn't have had it. I stopped claiming workshops because I usually don't need anything from them but I've got low level friends that do and deal with the passive loopholes that come with it so I end up joining them to help them fight. I'd love to see the system changed so people don't lose caps/junk except for the person putting the bounty since they're doing it by choice. To have people that want to PVP to fight like RDR guns blazing with an equal back and forth instead of who hits second wins.  But also people who are questing that get dragged into a fight to have the choice to fight that doesn't involve leaving the server or dealing with the passive slap crap. I don't look for fights but I do like to fight when they come to me but I hate losing 500 caps because they didn't show up hostile or some other crap that comes with the team PVP system they put in. 
---
I'd be happy if they just banned Legendaries from the PVP server and didn't transfer inventory over. Just plans and perks. 
---
Hangon, what?
---
You found a place to set up CAMP that has lead and iron? I've been looking for ages.
---
Or did they accidently do it without realising? Ive done it countless times because either I was too tired or becuase of server lag. So much hate that peeps are quick to finger point imo.
---
The universe isn't a democracy, it does as it pleases and we have no say, so your say has no bearing on the outcome unfortunately. 
---
Actually the handmade rifle does have a set spawn location. Only one though.

---
All day everyday but I still go in
---
Earlier today I had almost an 8 hour run of no blue screens no server losses. But then I try to log on around 11pm and I had 2 blue screens and 8 server disruptions making it unplayable for the night. :/
---
How so?  All it’s basically doing is burning twice the ammo for a higher per shot damage.  For some guns, this could get expensive really quick. The fire rate on the LMG, Mini Gun, 50, and the energy gatlings would burn through ammo fast. It would also make them break down twice as fast which is in itself a serious balance (especially for the plasma gatling and laser rifles which already break down stupid fast) 
---
Omg.... I just turned down 5 offers because they were all offering Stable &amp; I thought I needed Pure....
---
Is there a link to this new info google didn’t turn up anything other then the secret room news that was already know
---
And items already have models, so they wouldn't even have to model the idems
---
Wasn’t me but I left a bunch of plans at the Harpers Ferry vendor (in the cash register)- did anyone find those?  Pool table plans and some recipes and maybe patio table plans too. 
---
If anything, I think that they'll probably add this later on since the majority of the player base is below lvl 50. Its not really a huge concern I would say, for right anyways.
---
Just posting a link to it  
---

---
It would be more of an instance zone. So on the map nobody would show as at V76, since being at HUB 76 would exit you out of the current server. Have to make it so you return to your last server when you exit though.
---
Laser weps dont have bonus damage from explosive anyway. Laser are useless :(
---
Most definitely. That’s done at the machine in the order of mysteries lair right? Or you can upgrade through a armor station?
---
Nah man, even without stacking it was way too OP, especially the shotgun. Instead they should have looked at each gun uniquely.
---
I lost all my junk from uranium fever, Harpers ferry and SBQ battle.  I didn’t get a great look at everything in my junk before that tool kill me, but I know I had a bit over 100 black titanium and about 100 plastic from uranium fever and Watoga high school.  Not to mention all the flux I grabbed in the bog.  Such an aggravating night.
---
I agree great set up for it but that area is part of a current quest line you would need a HUB that is away from the current action.
---
&gt;We tried to do it again right after, but the server disconnected.
---
You only get to have fun like this ONCE a session. Didn't you know? / s
---
Seriously though, the constant disconnects are KILLING this game for me
---
Can confirm
---
AND a still to make other liquor! 
---
You cannot place a value on atoms that are earned in game. Once they are earned, they become harder to obtain as you cannot obtain the same twice.  The first 3,000 earned is easy and fast. Anything after then takes ages to accumulate the fee left. This trick is in video games in order to get the user to spend more.
---
Launching nukes might be canon but not how many nukes or at what location.
---
I expect more of "actual" vault 76 dwellers in terms of rebuilding the world than what the players can accomplish.
---
You ever see the kind of crap people have done in GTA Online? Expecting people to not abuse every exploit or cheat they can is just stupid. Most people that cheat, do it solely because they can. Failing to take that into account proves that Bethesda is either lazy or incompetent.
---
So if you completed the quest line you can craft the blade, voice, and garb, all to level 45-50 at workbenches in your camp
---
When I turn in tech docs I only get ammo and chems. Am I do something wrong?
---
I got a god roll 3* Furious rolling pin yesterday. I got mods for it if you need them for your new main weapon.
---
You know most people here just bandwagon their outrage, while blindly defending things that make no sense. Meanwhile, proclaiming all the YouTube vids are on the I hate fallout bandwagon without justification. 
---
Also, why would you let the cat out of the bag bro. Lol. 
---
Works like a pinyata.  But in this case it’s crossbow bolts.
---
(Also works for harpoon gun)
---
I'll check if I can in the morning.
---
Oh thats why i never get airborne diseases. The veil completes my Scarlet Sniper outfit very well so im happy to hear that.
---
How do you even get airborne diseases? And which one are airborne? 
---
You mean interesting stuff to build and create in the world? No fucking way, you have workshops, you should be grateful!
---
Apparently be careful of taking too much right now though as very high item amounts of stuff are getting people’s accounts banned 
---
You are essentially doubling dps for no drawback if you hit your shots. It might be more resource intensive but high level players have a lot of resources so it wouldn't be an issue to them. +25% still makes "two shot" or whatever its going to be now, still one of the best effects in the game.
---
Please give enemies prefixes like in Diablo. I want a radroach that shoots fire out it's ass
---
 Thankyou!
---
That doesn't say anything about locking the crate. It sounds to me like there was a problem with the holotape remaining in the player's inventory.
---
You can still zone to V76 it just give you the option to zone to V76 (outside) or into Hub 76 (inside). Sadly yes the new player would not be able to access the Hub til lvl 50 (or whatever level beth decides the quest will be made available).
---
I already had around 4,000 just from doing daily/weekly challenges (after those 3k you are talking about). Keeping over 2k if something time limited would come, what i have over i spend for cool cheap shit. Yeah i know you would like everything free, but thats not how it works, you have to earn it.
---
Nicely done!  I need to hit that bar soon!
---
And they break alot faster :/

What made it stand out so much? Honest just curious.

I was getting legendary exterminator wood pieces for like an hour and a half lol. Don’t give up!

Isn't this pretty much what the &gt;!Enclave base is intended to be!&lt; ? It's in the &gt;!middle!&lt; of the map, it has all the crafting stations, and "endgame" support features (i.e. &gt;!nuke related!&lt;). I don't know why it's missing a Stash...seems like an obvious omission. Either way it seems like the place people post level 50 are meant to gather. I know about the &gt;!Whitespring Service Entrance!&lt; but I still wish there was a direct (and free per your suggestion) fast travel to the interior which should unlock after you have made sufficient progress with the &gt;!faction!&lt;.

Or you can just buy it
---
Don't set up your camp on a mob spawn point.
---
I feel like deathclaw with third claw is better than the heated power fist because it deals only balistic damage which mobs have less resistance for.
---
(The mole miner gauntlet is way inferior to the other ones)
---
Every time this happens I do a 360° to see what's hitting me. Phantom pain...
---
You most certainly DO take slap damage when you have pacifist mode on, you just can't deal any to another player. The problem people are having is that slap damage isn't a static number, instead it's a percentage of your curret damage. Griefers/Exploiters are duping bobbleheads that boost their damage and stack so many of those bobbleheads that the 'small' percentage of slap damage is so high that it can kill pacifists in a single shot.
---
Live and let live. Easy.
---
I just sit back, play the game and wait for more content. Fo76 has huge potential and only out for a few months. Give them time. Its Bethesda first online fallout.
---
Im 100% certain 1 year ahead of now the game will be completly different.
---
Just same servers but with ho PvP restriction is not enough to justify a character reroll anyway, at least for most players.
---
When they bring new server options, they should offer abit more than just PvP.
---
Hardcore servers with brutal punishments would be nice.
---
When we launch a nuke on fissure prime and there is no Queen left to spawn...
---
Then we rebuild.
---
I just assumed a disconnect was part of the quest after you launched a nuke. 
---
That I have, I’ll try taking it off. Not great anyway I guess. 
---
It's okay, but honestly, Agatha's station in Fallout 4 is the best. 
---
Sweet old Lady surviving by herself in the wasteland playing the Violin... Basically for you
---
Yeah, legendaries should also be removed on the PvP server.
---
It'd allow the PvP to be something more beyond "stack as many effects as possible and see who 1 shots the other first".
---
That’s what I thought but I saw something about a “reinforced” version or something that requires the fabricator at the OoM lair, but that could have been part of the quest line and I’m just not rejembering it. 
---
Me too, I really want to keep playing
---
Ofc, but this indicates the devs don't intend to reopen v76, as they've gone out of their way to say it will be inhospitable. If anything, it seems more likely to me whatever methods vault Tek might employ to make an area inhospitable would be a good lore reason for a dungeon. Of course, that's only if the game lasts that long and if they were to create a new "born in Appalachia" spawn for fresh characters. 
---
Yup
---
thanks , I didn't know
---
So you’d be proposing that inside V76 is instanced but outside is not?  
---
I could still see high level players floating around outside 76 and interfering with the new player’s first interactions with the world.  
---
If the instanced zone were the nuke exclusion zone I think that would be enough to stop high level players from leaving the Hub and pestering low level players, however that does create problems with new players not being able to join low level players.  
---
I’d honestly just like to see a player hub area elsewhere in the game. Doesn’t require programming in instanced areas at all and keeps high levels away from low levels.
---
But there is a Holotape by the Vault 76 Overseer saying we've been nuking everywhere. 
---

---
So you are getting money for nothing, oh would you mind sending me some then?
---
PC unfortunately. 
---
There's PVP in this game?
---
This is a good idea.
---
You beat me to it all the up votes for you Sir!
---
Ya you can....
---
Mixer is being an ass. I will maybe switch it to my Facebook and do another stream on mixer later on.

---
Atoms are not transferable the way real money is in any way shape or form.
---
Hm.  I haven’t checked that but I’m pretty sure that if it existed I would have found out. I’ll check tonight and get back to you
---
Not too sure about re-using v76, but an auction system would be fabulous if properly implemented.
---
It was a real time auction house in which it was limited in size of number of items that can be traded and localized similar to current Vendor bots. This way we can have multiple auctions around the map and in different hubs.
---
That fire breather outfit is awesome. Does anyone know how to get it ?
---
I fear that as they did with 2SE weapons, they will fix it wrong way so rather be happy with what it is right now :D :D
---
it is still a bad idea to let her near the side of the map where she might just fly off at 22 mins lol but seems like it all worked out for you
---
Bethesda doesn't want to give players respec option because the fact that by keeping the player busy with something, ie. fixing their build, they're able to keep you in retention and keep you coming back to the game. By finishing your pefect build you'll burn out of the game faster than if you're working on something. Player retention is arguably more important than revenue especially to gauge the future prospects of the game so it would surprise me if they added the option to respec with atoms, let alone with caps since caps are a free currency.
---
You see my deadly fists clown? Come on, show me your skills Mr. Marine, Super Sledge?
---
Ok..
---
Fuck the DMV and in the game
---
so they ruin the game becuase of pvp what noboy play and want? 
---
Yeah, how's "inhospitable" ever stopped high level players?
---
nothing in that transcripit about launching enough. she might have just had the same view as maxson, that the nukes shouldnt be used for any reason while you took the other view of the threat is to great, nuke it.
---
Well that definitely sounds like a good build. I'm sure your weapon drained his ap fast enough to kill him then. Automatic weapons seem to be the best counter to it, but they seem rarer than other builds.
---
This would rock!
---
Imo, it addresses the players, not the "actual" vault dwellers.
---
Wouldn't consider it canon.
---
Yeah man there's so much repeating that I'm thinking I'm seeing the same thread from hours ago but its one that's new.
---
"Look for the tell-tale shimmer"

---
I would still like the ability to make my CAMP a marked location on the map and have personal vending machines. Maybe make the Terminal plan have a Market option?
---
I've spent the last 4 days of gameplay perfecting my tree-CAMP. 
---
The legendary weapon/armor will sometimes take a bit to load. 
---
you’d be surprised how easy it is to kill enemies with the bonus. There’s this perk card that allows you to go into caution immediately after an engagement given that the enemy isn’t making a beeline towards you. Pack that with the 75% sneak, 2.5x damage, and all maxed out rifleman cards I can one shot glowing ghouls at whitesprings if I land a headshot with my base hunting rifle. Sometimes they’re right in front of me and I can do them in in 2 shots but if I start getting chased I gotta switch to another gun. 
---
If you use chameleon you can basically get away with everything but I like to play with ratty “wastelander” clothing so I don’t use chameleon. 
---
PA is a lot of fun but I’d need to specialize some stuff for it. I also don’t like using little guns with PA so I’d have to completely change my build haha. I have a furious flamer that I want to use on everything but never have enough fuel. 
---
No it doesn't. Back to school for you. Or at least invest in a dictionary. 
---
Are you sure? You still have it? If so and are on Xbox, would you be willing to sell it to me? I want it as a collectors item but managed to lose mine somehow
---
They cant kill you if you dont attack back(without booblehead stack glitch). People would abuse pacifist if it would work like you said. It is your bad you entered pvp with them, and even bigger bad you had so much junk on you. I throw away junk i get over 150 each, anyway i would pick your shit, just for you to learn. Why you complain, this is how game is, why everyone want change game mechanics, becouse they dont understand them. 
---
Yep, you get it after completing Into The Fire
---
That’s what I was wanting too if we did it in camp. Problem is, can the vendor machine be damaged by other players?  Can someone come by and stop it from selling to others by destroying it?  Can they rob it?  Having your camp marked on the map is also an invitation to getting it destroyed. 
---
I actually prefer the death tambo, also a unarmed weapon.
---
I am on PC and I still haven’t figured out what button opens the VATS. I keep forgetting about it. 
---
Another bug... who would've guessed 
---
I enjoyed it during the story. I’m talking endgame like bloodied build etc
---
Chill
---
no I was getting attacked by an invisible yaoi goi or however you spell it
---
Yeah to scrapping ammo and repair kits
---
There's no need to bulk anything except Aluminum and Lead.
---
I have a bud that runs a low health build. Adrenal reaction, nerd rage, and such. He started mentioning that he would die out of nowhere. At first, I figured he was just getting hit by something or simply taking too many rads. But after a while, I noticed that he *would* just drop dead randomly. In the Whitesprings bunker, inside of camp, or just standing somewhere
---
You get notification about possibility when you are in are where you can get them. They are like some lung disease ect.
---
Usually if you see there's something in air in some area then there can be that.
---
Bruh
---
I haven't played fallout 76 yet. Is it a main quest ?
---
ihave a lead extractor at my base curentl have 1200 2mm amo and 3400 fusion cell for tesla. and have around 500 lead on the mule inventory.
---
u craft 27 2mm amo for 5lead or 53 with super duper perk.
---
Yes pretty early on, hang onto things like the responders items you get too
---
Yeah well I just had sigrun one shot and died so
---
Yeah, I've noticed some illicit items around but I make sure to steer clear
---
What if the overseer made the new hub and was a new faction and she gets to be a npc like Rosie and she gives you missions and opens more of vault 76 since she is the overseer 
---
What’s the melee need?
---
Also, IMO they should add legendary loot (at least a chance of drop) in dungeons and caves after fighting a fuck-ton high-level enemies. 
---
I'm sure that'll make someone's day 🐧
---
Correct... it fires like a SMG and goes through 100 fuel in seconds and has a great range but is pretty much worthless cause fuel is too expensive to craft 
---
Same, had an infinite loading screen last night. I really got my hopes up that this last update would Polish the game. But clearly, that whole month they had to get things right was probably spent giving staff vacation. I really like playing and have played since beta, but the bugs are finally getting on my nerves. 76 should have stayed in Development for at the very least 6 more months. I don’t want the state the game is in to ruin it for me. So I’m going to take a break. I’m really hoping when I come back the game is cleaned up. 
---
I heard from another response that its fairly new
---
I love that robot so much.  Always stop by when on my way to the artisans corner.   
---
Yeah but this is the point: what is missing is player vending machine, not a hub.
---
Top of the world, whitespring, flatwoods, you can use almost any place from the game as a hub IF PEOPLE CAN USE IT AS A HUB AND SELL THINGS.
---
Figure out how to rest the campfires just a bit *below* the actual floor, then placing the floor over it, leads to them only causing bright lights on the floor and clipping through. Can be rough depending on your base type for doing it. Some bases it was so snug it was ridiculous, in my current one I have to use about 4 connected rugs, tri campfire setup, all hanging off some nearby steel beams defying the laws of gravity because rugs are OP.
---
Working on encasing the ugliness in walls and such. Leading to a bit of a resource hog, but aesthetic is aesthetic.
---
How'd you get that blue BOS jumpsuit? need it to complete my brotherhood apparel set
---
Yes, by your logic blame the victim for poorly designed mechanics. No room for criticism.
---
Hopefully the vaults that they will open will be challenging dungeons.
---
Bingo. This is exactly my build and I will cut you if you try to take my wood armor from me. 
---
hi, so I really don't know a lot here, am only now joining this conversation, but yes explosive on anything is op as fuck true. I bought a second level 50 bunkerbuster from an ingame venor (because apparently someone thought selling this gun like this was a good idea) I put stabalizers on 'em both so gl n hf dancing that, oh and am not above quick swaping them, and I use the accessabilities menu of my ps4 (if you call me a cheater for using this you're a moron) and I play full movement speed but I don't use vats well enough (in some aspect thats a nerf and some it's a buff, because i've easier hit confirms but I don't utilize crits as effectively (that's a huge nerf and I'm working at it))
---
But I'm also not afraid of any dupers, cheaters, hackers, idk. I think that are probably lots of people out there who play the game, can take care of themselves, but are so immersive about these games they wouldn't be going straight to community especially after the way the game launched. 
---
if you are not good enough to basically out "no skill" kill the person, make them wanted. the pvp servers are going to solve so many problems for those kinds of players but I honestly do not like the idea that they've few ways to help the casual player because that's also the kind of person who didn't sign up for this shit.
---
I'm not saying the right now they should or should not nerf them right now but this is the best and fastest way to take a substantial bite out of crime.
---
I remeber watching a juicehead video where he said maybe raising the level cap might do something for the "good" of the situation. but that's insane. that would probably cause so many other balance issues. the number 50 is there for a reason. but I get where he was coming from and honestly it might be cool to have a higher level cap but that's  not going to help anything if it breaks everything else but hey it was an idea
---
Agree.
---
Got almost 1k 5.56 with your name on them. Platform? 
---
Nerf is needed. Respec should also be given though to account for it
---
I traded with another player. 
---
You sir, are an idiot.
---
Yep the playlists get better every game imo. 
---
Classical makes the game feel like a movie at times. Sometimes it’s just perfect for what I’m doing.  Appalachia can lift my spirits but also make me feel deeper feels. Gotta pay attention to what its doing.  The original score is once again phenomenal, and id consider it the relaxing/ambient mood.  
---
Then there’s nothing at all, which might be the most immersive 
---
Not taking it far enough. Make it so that SPECIAL points are *determined* by the number of cards of each SPECIAL type you equip, instead of being the limiting / controlling factor on how many cards of each type you can equip. It would still be capped at 15 cards per SPECIAL type and we'd still have the same limit on total number of cards. End result is that we can freely respec at any time just by switching cards. Seems like obviously better design and perhaps how the system was intended to be until someone in management said "we need to add more grind so players can play the game longer".
---
Words can't describe how fucking envious I am of that tattered field jacket. I can't even get the game to give me daily quests or events in the Mire anymore, it's like it realized I was trying to farm them and it's trying to shoo me away to other parts of the map.
---
Screws are basically the most valuable item in the game and it just deleted 50 of them. I guess I'll never get that Excavator armor 
---
what is it like with mev? I've been wondering
---
Or people who legitimately earned one, and are feeling like they're being punished along with the exploiters and pay to win people.
---
Damage values will go up as level cap increases, a one handed quicker melee weapon will never do as much damage as a big ol 2h, it's just balancing
---
mirv lol
---
Based on lore and where the wood pieces originated from (Mire), I believe they do belong in the high level loot tables.
---
The lore are that they got created in the Mire bunkers as a defense.
---
Yeah, but Bethesda needs to fix ALL the duping methods. There are at least three duping techniques available that I know of at the moment.
---
F 
---
Slow and steady fellow dweller :) you'll get that excavator armour soon
---
That's a possibility as well. I lost a quad gauss rifle when giving items to my friend because I accidentally dropped it with the weapons I was giving him. He never grabbed it and then we got booted soon after, so I couldn't get it back. My own stupidity for not paying attention. 
---
I played with them and they do very little damage. Like 35 dmg per hit with medium attack speed. And unnarmed perks don't apply to them.
---
Be cool if the vendors pop on the map or a list like you say, but you can also display what type of items it sells maybe in a description of some sort, and also name accordingly. Small things like this would go a long way. 
---
That would make it 7.2x times faster to earn caps than it is today. And keep people playing for hours instead of returning a few hours per day. Or they could limit vendor cap regeneration it to ingame playtime. But that would make a lot of idling players. I don't think Bethesda want either.
---
I like the regenerating cap stash idea. But keep cap regeneration at 1 cap per vendor pool every 7-8 minutes would make it the same balance as today, but be a bit less annoying.
---
Hell I’m right by the overseers camp and never even see anyone 
---
Do you think that will stop duped bobble head exploits and your theoretical one shot pacifist kills? If they reduced the damage to any weapon by 90%, with enough bobbleheads they can multiply their damage be it explosive or not to the same stupid high levels. Is it too hard to have a discussion without acting childish?  
---
I see no complaints in your argument.
---
It is true. The only weight you save is using up plastic. You might as well throw the plastic away if you want to save weight that way, And some even bulk into heavier weight.
---
I’ve had two crashes today. Both infinite load screens. One was when I first started playing and just reloaded. I the. got stuck on the pip boy blank screen and reloaded again.  
---
I then played pretty much all day with no crash. I had two workshops going when I got the infinite load screen again.  It’s a bummer but I feel I got off easy 
---
it's a two shot, if op, then get it out of the game alltogether...it will be so annoying to use it knowing it does not do double damage...just stupid...the explosive crap is what needed a nerf
---
I have gotten anywhere between 10-15 two shot weapons, 5 or so explosive weapons and one two shot explosive weapon. They drop. You guys need to quit acting like they are only spawned out of dupers asses.
---
I'm in nz, probably different servers if that makes any difference? 
---
Ugh I loved Agatha’s quest. I’d found the violin by pure accident one time and found her shack by pure accident too. Imagine my surprise when this lady starts playing her heart away on the radio as I started getting a little tired of 3 dawg. It was heaven. I remember just sitting back in my seat and smiling. 
---
I loved her little dedications before each song. 
---
Wait you mean 3 right? Is she in 4 as well?! 
---
I'm not too keen on idea of vault 76 being reused. Instead I would prefer for when player owned vending machines go live that it will show up as a free fast travel spot for all players. Along with allowing CAMPs to be built closer to each other would naturally create hub locations through out the map. I think also adding additional resources that can be generated in CAMP and creating a system where nearby camps can contribute a bonus to each other would also help.
---
They don’t owe you anything. Respec like everyone else.
---
Name is most likely gonna change to something else, +25% damage is fine for balancing
---
Given the horrific reviews across the board and the total lack of a playerbase, you're in the minority. It's great that youre enjoying a product, but it is near-unanimously seen as a cesspool of miserable failure 
---
I guess there will not be a pacifist mode but you'd still have a bounty. That's almost honorific at some point, in a PvP server, to have a tag saying "biggest shark around"
---
Unfortunately, it's a stupidly designed game all the way through.
---
&gt; People spend $5 on this? 
---
You were comparing $ to atoms. I told you, that you dont need   
---
real money for this, but you have to play and do some challenges. 
---
You replied " Or you can just buy it with zero in game work required. " That lead me to ask you, if you get real money for doing nothing.
---
So no, ppl dont spend 5$ on this. They spend 560 atoms. Which is one week playing 30minutes daily and people don't make 5$ playing this game playing 30minutes daily.
---
They can fill community resources and gathering places with bad feelings and vitriol to the point where the game feels lonelier after you've technically "reached out" to the community in the act of coming somewhere like this subreddit.
---
Feels bad man

The veil is actually designed for filtration, it's not just something you put over your mouth.

---
Over 200 hours of playtime for me. Haven't seen one explosive weapon and maybe 3-4 two shot weapons. When you see 6 people all rocking the same two shot explosive shotguns, it's hard not to be suspicious. 
---
Yea thats a good idea. You would have to cap their special at 10 like you said to keep it fair.
---
I love it too 💖
---
That's weird I didn't think you could even bulk screws since they can be sold plain. 
---
She dies
---
I smell jealousy. Seriously though people for the nerf only are because they don't have one or have been killed by one too many times. Lol it will still be best in slot for a non bloodied build I suppose.
---
Its the second post down in the "hot posts" they edited the inside the vault article. 
---
I've gotten it from a messenger event in the Forest. My buddy got it from the Cranberry Bog but doesn't remember what event. Happen to have an extra Brotherhood Fatigues? Not the under armor ones
---
something weari g a gas mask attacks her
---
We don’t need nerfs to Unyielding thanks. 
---
We’re already weak as it is, go nerf the guns some more.
---
What's your Gamertag? I'll hook you up with someone
---
Im on xbox and i believe so? unsure
---
Is there a way to be alerted when Bethesda makes a new Inside the Vault article? Like sign up for a newsletter, download an app like in Destiny or receive an alert some other way?  Or do I just have to visit the website once a week?
---
I finished every quest avaliable in this game. Now usually I search for low level players and help them with their adventures, I also provide them with free stimpaks and water. 
---
Interesting and tempting things there. -Raises eyebrows-
---
I earned my two shot gauss. If you can call getting a lucky random drop "earning" it.  I still don't mind the nerf because it was needed. TS and explosive weapons made every other lrefix obsolete and trivialized content. I don't mind things being fixed in the name of balance. 
---
I get that, but there are the few who have them and are the first and only owners of said weapons. On a side note, I'm starting to think that luck stat does affect drop rate, as I started off boosting only perception agility and luck, my luck being 14 unbuffed.
---
Though in real life people do just put things over their mouths to prevent the spread of germs and diseases etc.
---
I'd be cool with that.
---
I'd also be cool if those vending machines went in the basement of the Whitesprings.
---
I DO NOT want to have to mark my camp on the map for griefers to show up at, or compete for land around whitesprings because that's where everyone is going to go anyways.
---
Noboy uses the microphone, right? ,I've been trying to contact with strangers but nobody answers
---
For sure
---
I'm on PC and I probably can't afford whatever they would want if you're referring to someone selling one, but I appreciate the offer.
---
There’s nothing elitist about this. He’s saying that if you show up to Scorched Earth, don’t sit on your ass in the shack after tagging her waiting for her to die and get loot you had no part in earning. 
---
In other words, if you’re there, you need to pull your weight. Can’t hurt the SBQ?  Fine. Tenderize her, take out lesser spawns, etc.  Nothing aggravates me more about hitting prime than seeing a huddled mass of low level players hiding in the exit to glassed caverns just hanging out waiting to scoop up some XP and loot. 
---
I may be wrong but I think it has to do with the first person to be in the area when it spawns (if a level 40+ makes the area load, then it will be level 45)
---
I agree they need a nerf but 75% reduction is alot and even more so for the explosive. They should have brought it back to fallout 4 standard for two shot, and made demolition expert not effect the legendary affix. Easy solution if you ask me.
---
I don't like the idea of learnable legendary traits because this would mean everyone getting the same meta gun in no time. We have to think a way extremely hard to get the knowledge of legendary traits, like a raid. I would like more modifications that changes stats, armor penetrations, damage absorption, rad resistance, damage type. All learnable, maybe after a level cap or maybe after a quest like (kill 100 schorchbeast queen and than you have a random plan for a random item or a random plan for a fixed item or a fixed plan for a random item). Maybe this could be like weekly quests.
---
Dang, and nah he's just wanting to trade it 
---
“As a raider” 🙄
---
I guess I should thank you for pointing this out, I probably won’t claim any more workshops since I have zero interest in what this game calls PvP.  I had fun building defenses and holding against waves of enemies, even if they were pretty weak and predictable.
---
But thank you for pointing this out, really.  I’ve only been harassed a few times and I just leave when it happens.  Luckily I’ve never experienced this in particular and glad to know it’s possible and how to avoid it in the future.
---
Since workshops are a pvp thing that’s just one less thing I’ll get to enjoy.  Bummer, but there are plenty of other things out there for me to enjoy in the game.
---
A literal "inside a vault" event. Not Vault 76, mind you.
---
Seems like you are at a huge disadvantage if you aren’t using melee or heavy guns, I did a small guns (shotgun/rifle) build and I just can’t keep up with any of my teammates even though I have all the damage perk cards I can get for both weapons 
---
Awesome same, and please please check :)
---
Wow 65 days old and this quest still isn’t fixed, I’ve been stuck on it for about a week now and nothing seems to work :/
---
This happened to me too and I am using bloodied build with all the said perks and mutation too. Someone mentioned it is because buff that add HP such as “Well Fed” running out will be deducted from your CURRENT HEALTH instead of TOTAL HEALTH. Also when loading into new area, perk like Lifegiver might not load immediately and deduct your HP again
---
I feel like the best way to make em more effective is to decrease the resistance to them for certain monsters. Like super mutants. 
---
I dump plans and recipes at flatwoods all the time. Hopefully someone gets some use out of them. 
---
Yes please :)
---
GRAY OUT plans you already know in vendor UI, bag UI, and trading UI.  You can still buy GRAYED OUT plans, but at least you know you know them first.
---
With the dupers, nerfing TSE is the safe way to try and get handle on the issue.
---
TSE are way overpowered.
---
I'll pass the info along and see if it helps. Thanks!
---
This ... No. This isn't a good idea. 
---
Evidently you just chose not to read the final paragraph.  
---
I'm impressed.
---
And yes I knew it opened me up for pvp, but I thought just my workshop was opened up for pvp (and me while I was at it).  If someone ever came to take it, they can have it.
---
While not as fabulous as this one, I think putting with the Garvey duster set works fine too.
---
That will be 400 atoms per variant, please!
---
Ahh, that makes sense. So if I were to server hop I'd eventually be the first one there. Thanks
---
I read enough. The damage values in this game are scaled equally with each other based on level, and will go up as level cap is increased. 
---
850 hours? Get a job, jesus. 
---
NOPE.
---
I've already rolled 2 characters up to level 150+.
---
I'm not rolling a 3rd, 4th, 5th character for every new "flavor" of server that comes out.  I'm fine if your inventory doesn't transfer, but I'm not starting another character from scratch.  I'm also fine if you say no legendaries.
---
If you have to roll new characters for these different "flavor" servers, enjoy playing with nobody.
---
I honestly have no idea how so many people have issues with it since i've never had any problems regarding this topic"

Totally agree. My bf and I figured out if you buy a paint from the atom store it puts the atom sign next to the frame in our inventory even if you only paint one piece. But that only helps a little, like you, I have four sets in my highest character. Even if they labeled one piece like the chest XO T60 etc. That would help.
---
I'm also worried my explosive shotgun is going to be nerfed. I love that gun for queen fights, I don't use it in areas where we need to share the hits with other characters, but I don't have anything else that can really help with a queen in the time we have.
---
I feel this would only work if the vault instance was the same one for players from all servers.  People are spaced apart so far in the open world that I feel if you went in there as things are now you get a 50/50 chance anyone else would be there with you.  If it was a true hub for all players from all servers, it would be more likely to be busy and have people set up as merchants etc etc.
---
That would be the field scribe hat you're thinking of, so no only the outfit 
---
I currently have a 3 star Cryolator with explosive damage.
---
I knew there was the Field scribe hat, just don't Know if that had one too
---
At level 50 a full special respect option should be given to the player (just points no cards) this can be used por saved for later levels.
---
The playera should be able to de level cards dymaically as said in another commet (only need rank 3 makeshift but you got the 5 star? Just rank it down and vice versa)
---
Duplicate cards should give a 2:1 conversión option for another random card (eliminating the endless duplicates that just stack ur cards)
---
Cards should have a discard option, self explanatory.
---
I'm not saying it's good. Just that's the entry.
---
I was stung with a 10 cap bounty myself. 
---
Except for the "Scorched Earth" event. That should have its fast travel cost doubled or tripled.
---
Yes please.
---
Nobody wants that garbage.
---
They could have random events in there like the Valut-tec any loitering system kicks in every once in a while and a bunch of hungry panthers are set loose inside the vault.  Drama ensues.
---
I'm sure it feels bad to be an owner of a gg weapon only to have it be nerfed, but as a player of the game and wanting the game to be a better this was one of the most obvious balance changes that was needed. Legendary effects should increase the overall DPS of a weapon by at most 25%, certainly not 100% increase or more. Have you ever tried turning on god-mode in a single player game that has built-in cheats? If you play the game that way it gets boring   
---
really fast. That's basically the effect that Two Shot (Explosive) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ have on the game - makes all of the game content trivial and it ruins PvP balance as well. I said it before but it reminds me of Borderlands 2's Bee Shield + Conference Call combo which eventually got nerfed - most obviously needed nerf ever.
---
Dude! Recently made the switch after hearing butcher pete for the hundreth time. Gotta love those sweet moments when Mars the Bringer of War or Ride of the Valkyries comes on!
---
In an event we can’t harm other players in the event (excepting any poor bastard dumb enough to join an event while wanted). As such, I can’t see how we could damage other players’ armor if we aren’t dealing any damage to them. 
---
You want some officer fatigues too? i learned the plan so i can make alot
---
I definitely agree. We need something like a player hub in this game. 
---
So how does making new characters work now then? You still wake up inside the vault right? You just can’t ever go back inside once you leave it
---
I don't think I have that either actually, so sure I'll take one of those too!
---
I currently am using a lv 50 combat knife 2 star - 
---
+40% attack speed  and +10% damage to player
---
I added the serrated mod after the fact for the extra bleed damage- it’s my primary weapon atm. Fun to use. 
---
Need some improvements like division game
---
I see.  I had White Knight Rank 3 equipped at all times.   I am in middle of modifying my build through respec, so not dont think it will remain that way though.
---
I like this because, lore wise, we'll be able to get literally any crazy content down the line
---
You're right. I never noticed it before either, only springs.
---
If you go to "hot" and see the patch notes post by BSG, there will be a link to the thread with "into the vault" notes completely posted on reddit 
---
That you can only reliably use a select few weapons at end game in a roleplaying game isn't fine.
---
3/4 of the weapons in the game aren't worth using beyond the first hour of the game. That's an issue.
---
It's insane they have not fixed the fact that:  
---
-Wood armor Scraps for nothing.. Because a pencil gives more wood than a wooden torso that fits a full grown man.  
---
-Wood Armor is incapable of dropping higher than 1*
---
Thinking same thing...or that they we saying "hey players you got your screws loose!"
---
Happy Cake Day  🎂
---
I really like this Idea ! 
---
Sure thing buddy
---
Get wrekt. Adapt or die
---
If you want, go ahead and shoot me a message, my gamertag is Soggy Lint
---
God forbid certain weapon mods are better than others. The horror !
---
The fatigues are called the bos scribe outfit in this game so bear with me (i have 3 on hand)
---
That's an issue with balancing, they need to just make the DPS roughly similar, which will be a whole lot easier than redoing the loot system.
---
I feel the same way about things like crossbows, which do less damage than a lever action with a much worse reload economy. Same goes for things like pistols and energy weapons 
---
So you *are* judging then. 
---
The Bethesda Reddit account already said they are aware of this request. I bet it's in the next patch.
---
Someone else posted as well correcting that for me.   You are correct, it does work the same with Chemist.
---
Except your name. 
---
If you’re wanted, there’ll be a giant bounty logo over your head so if you’re a criminal, good luck trying to hide. 
---
I have had dozens of two shots and two shot explosives drop (only 1 3 star to date) . I am fine with the nerf as it took the spice out for me.  I even ruined myself leveling an alt since I had a TSE lvl 5 pump action. While everyone wants the superior weapons and that is to be expected it really limited the feel of variety.   
---
I currently have an instigating with 10% while aiming 90% reduced weight gauss and I use an executioners 25% fire  rate 15% reload lever action. on my 4th character. It is so much more fun now, no more hopping around like an idiot blaming everything.   
---
While not a popular opinion I stand by it.I hate things that are to easy and I will end up doing something like laser/plasma on my 5th for sure just for that final extra challenge to myself. Though I could go punching only with the only weapon aside from my fists being a boxing glove but that may be a bit to tedious.   
---
Current levels are 204, 100, 51, 45. No quests perks or specials on my 45 it has been an interesting few days. 
---
Lots of perks are available for pistols, I can definitely seeing Dual Pistols being added, but not sure how that would balance out with there rest of the guns.  Could be OP.   I mean you could get TSE pistols and outdamage everything in sight, including legendary Plasma Gatling.   This should really never be the case logically if you think about the Plasma Gatling. 
---
I wish the game was more challenging tbh
---
sent an inv
---
I agree the economy sucks, but FYI there are 7 different vendor cap pools. [See here.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/508524419715563522/513492796213166110/Channel5-Fallout-76-Vendor-Guide.jpg?width=738&amp;height=703)
---
I have nearly one for every weapon type bruh
---
Pretty sure it's just rifles
---
Even with the nerf TSE guns will still be the strongest guns in the game in most situations. Rebalancing happens constantly in online games. I don't know if all you people comparing have never played online or if this community is just particularly whiney or what but seriously this is what happens. People discover a meta, everyone switches go it, the meta gets nerfed people find a new one and the cycle continues. That is how online games work. Otherwise they end.
---
You shoot down my nuke you best believe you're getting the same thing all them bots got 
---
free fast travel and a great source to level up alts while getting a ton of junk. I take 11-12 every day and just literally spend 90% of my time fast travel defending. Though I ended up with every plan you can get from them at least 3 times over. 
---
Dead Money is a great dlc, but it’s definitely not as hard as you remember it. It’s only tricky the first time. 
---
Just have to remember this is an online RPG not an MMO like so many people think its supposed to be. The elements of true mmo's (most importantly the community) are so distant from this game and likely to never appear. Npcs, populated towns, livable dwellings like apartments, pets, mounts, working economy between players, rewarding progressive end game content (we'll see, vaults dlc. We'll see) and so much more just aren't likely to ever be added sadly. 
---
1. The two Watoga vendors. Return to camp.
---
2. Harper's Ferry. Return to camp.
---
3. Whitespring (Artisan's Corner but also check the pharmacy), then the secret door to the Whitespring Bunker (check science bay and command center).
---
4. Sutton Station.
---
5. Flatwoods.
---
I have my camp positioned between the first three stops to minimize fast travel costs (and for a junk resource). I don't find many legendaries at Sutton so I've been wondering where else people are going.
---
I agree. Also, before doing so, please fix all the dupe exploits. I don't want dupers to win PVP fights because they bought a bunch of duped explosive guns.
---
but thats what mmo's are supposed to be
---
People fight long and hard to get access to a nuke, and just having it shot down would be stupid. Wait until you’ve launched a nuke to see if you want it balanced
---
I got brick walls and I’m on PS4 
---
yea they need to make all weapons of each specific type(and swing speed types) have the same damage at max level. so like all one handed weapons that have a swing speed of medium all have the same damage at max level for example so people can be unique in their weapon choice without being gimped in damage like they are now. like no one is gonna use a sickle at max level when the assualtron blade is way better. obv the only thing that would effect anything if they were all equal damage would be their legendary effects
---
Most sensible post I’ve seen on reddit thus far. This thread should be stickied.
---
nope it does not. 
---
May not have been me, but I did the same in the suitcases on the side of the station a day ago. Used to drop stuff at my camp, but it's out of the way and saw in this forum that some folks were leaving stuff at the train stations to help out other players and decided to hop on the bandwagon too... I hope this really catches on as it makes the game better for everyone.
---
I do wonder how long stuff you drop persists, and if there is a difference between just dropping a bag or putting it in a persistent container in the game though.?
---
I disagree for this reason: I've taken the liberty of dropping every piece of equipment I own at level 230. And by every piece, I literally mean every piece. Gone. I played the game with only crafted equipment. While my PVP skills were lacking, and there were a few runs with the queen where my original damage boost may have made the difference between winning and losing, I was able to do everything I could do before only a little slower. I eventually managed to drop more god roll equipment and now I'm up to par again. The only things I had trouble with were legendary colonel's and massive groups of super mutants with crafted only equipment.
---
So I have to say, the argument, "we're weak as it is" doesn't really fly by me. And the dry remark afterwards is just annoying. Next time you post on one of my threads, I'd hope you have a slightly more thoughtful comment than sarcastic gratitude and suggestions.
---
At it's core though, I respect your opinion of not nerfing unyielding. I disagree, but that doesn't mean I'm right. Thank you for sharing.
---
People have been saying this specific complaint en masse since the beta, though. 
---
I'd be very cautious about in-game trading. Diablo 3 set an example of what it can become - not just real money auction, but in-game currency too. Considering that fallout 76 has no "soulbound" items like WoW, it means any item can be traded and you can get all your gear from auction. Which could probably encourage player to simply farm caps instead of legendaries, or farm some rare valuable resources. Or even speculate on auction house, buying and reselling items and wrecking havoc on prices.
---
What I'm trying to say is: I want auction to improve the game, but I don't want auction to replace the game.
---
I don't use passive mode so I'm very unfamiliar with it, but my friend was supposedly in passive. I was not
---
They're both a problem.
---
I need to spend 9 perk points to increase the damage of a specific weapon by 60%. TS and Explosive give a far bigger damage increase, especially together.
---
The damage scaling that these two Legendary effects allowed is way out of proportions, and that is going to be a serious problem when balancing anything in the game. Also PvE, because the have's one-shot enemies and the have-not's complain enemies are bullet sponges.
---
Even if Explosive is the bigger offender that does not excuse Two-shot from still being a ridiculous damage boost over regular weapons.
---
I'm not wrong buds.
---
Ppl think melee will be king yet you can't find a single video on youtube showing a melee character fighting others geared for pvp.
---
The pvp mode servers are going to be a rude awakening for some ppl.
---
Melee damage can be reduced so much more than gun damage that it will make your headspin. 
---
And the meta assassin/sentinel gear shits all over unyielding bloodied gas cannons.
---
The conversation is related to the 'explosive' legendary effect, and not explosive weapons themselves (missile launchers, fatman, etc).
---
Probably a melee build. I’m melee and was killing lvl 60 scorched in nuke zones around 15-20, and I’ve never taken any increase damage perks. I mostly solo everything, only a queen is too hard- until it lands. 
---
ATOM prices for items are fine.  Its the money vs # of ATOMS that is the issue.
---
You should really get 2000 ATOMS for 5 USD ($5).   
---
Then people buying the ATOMS would get decent prices and those of us trying to just play-earn them would have current slow rate.   Thus provides more incentive for buying ATOMS.
---
Man don't be a judgement mak jerk, everyone situation is different.   
---
Personally have an insane amount of time in '76 right now, and feel zero guilt about it because...  
---
I'm recovering from 1st - 3rd degree burns on both arms and hands, and the immersive distraction is enough to let me not take opiates for the pain, and I often forget about the insane, non-stop itching...  
---
So I could either be a drugged out mess flirting with addiction, an Jerk to my friends and family because I'm not taking the meds and don't have a good enough panacea, or I can play '76..  
---
Bonus Points:  
---
It counts as PT.. Because if I stop moving my fingers and hands the skin and soft tissue will lose elasticity, which is a serious problem with hand burns...  
---
No shotgun ARP perks
---
I do not think the intent is to deceive, I think they thought they would set pre-determined prices on items, then when releasing it, make it on "sale" as opportunity to get it right away at reduced price, 1 week later the sale is removed and the price increases.
---
I have seen new items behave this way and thus, its actually really on sale.
---
Whatever special you pick to view perks is where the point go.
---
You can't view perks without picking a special first
---
Y tho? and if the SAMs from pre-war could shoot down nukes, why are there so many dead people 
---
Isn't Bethesda still planning on nerfing Two Shot though despite Explosive being the main problem?
---
I never said anything about balance, nor would I as I think the idea of balancing this game is stupid. I don't care how much effort you put in to launching that nuke, I still want to shoot it down.
---
[Marcus and Jacob would be proud.](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Marcus)
---
My current and personal favourite is the explorer's outfit, ushanka hat, and either welder's goggles+skull bandana or gas mask (depending on area). Don't know how rare the explorer's outfit is but I've only come accross 2 so far but I don't tend to revisit locations unless my quest is nearby. 
---
Two shot is also overbudget in terms of damage increase.
---
It costs you a ton of perks to get just a 60% damage increase on a specific weapon. TS and Explosive are both way to much of a dps increase that they make other effects and baseline weapons feel redundant.
---
Thought son, thank u guys 
---
Sargon literally said this exact thing in his”how to make 76 a better game” video
---
There's a Magazine called Live and Love 8 I think that gives +5% XP while on a team.
---
People with red-green colourblindness can’t discern between three factions on that map
---
I realized this early on and incorporated it into my outfit and it works perfectly but it great tip for new players 
---
This is an awesome idea, anything close to player hub currently is whitesprings. They could also put player vendors in whitesprings. All those rooms upstairs that need handscanners can open up as player vendors. You automatically get a slot when you log in and then your vendor disappears when you leave the server.
---
I think it’d be a player thing like a stash that only takes certain item types 
---
I want a Clean Mr. Fuzzy costume. I would pay real world currency if I didn't have the atoms for that.
---
Dont need to "save" it as plenty of people use that thing, one of the more popular guns.   But I get what you mean to say that it needs improvement on the textures.
---
They should also add some sub-menu where you can see all your known recipes and plans. I'd like to know if can craft some mode myself before purchasing it from vendor, but without having to put an actual item on a work bench.
---
I'm a solo player that grinded my ass off to get a quad explosive radium rifle.
---
It's the only gun I have and it's not even that good.........after the nerd it will be a piece of shit.
---
I spent the last week jumping from vendor to vendor looking for mods for my piece of shit radium rifle.
---
You won't ever have to worry about me running around with any duped guns because I'll be playing something else after this Nerf. I won't spend any more time picking up shit loot drops hoping to get something decent only to have an 80% Nerf applied to whatever I find a week later.
---
Because the missileers hadn't completed the quest that gives you tech to modify the SAMs to shoot down nukes.
---
Check your in game audio settings.  I keep mine on atea and have no problems.
---
Bring it.
---
I have a little how to at the end of the imgur album :)
---
Acid did, until they changed it to 15 instead of 10. 
---
I hate to say it but you're shit if you can't kill th he queen without tse
---
I'm disappointed there's nothing to do there. How about a room you can rent or slot machines (as long as you can't ever buy caps in game with real money). Could be a nice hub, especially when there's nukes dropping outside and everyone flocks over ...
---
Spotlight + turrets
---
Thanks man :)
---
Well I didn't make the map. I just use it.
---
Also I must correct my earlier statement. There are actually 8 vendor cap stashes if you count Graham, the traveling merchant. But good luck finding him.
---
Yay, back to 15 bullets per mongrel dog....
---
You can’t bulk screws. Only items you can bulk are the ones that have a value of 0 (because bulking is the only way to sell them to a vendor). 
---
Because they seemed to have stopped the Dupers... that was what was causing majority of server stability issues.
---
I got my handmade plans at level 46 from Patrol Duty.
---
Yes im aware. Over the last few levels i have gotten 2 starched genes and 2 one gun Army which are both luck perks and i got 1 level of gun nut. But my special stats don’t reflect it. So I’m assuming its a bug of some sort
---

---
Game has become very unstable since update. Crashes constantly, freezes, and often gets stuck on pip boy.
---
Prior to the update, I experienced multiple crashes per session, but at least I could play the game. I tried to keep an open mind about FO76, despite the problems surrounding its launch, but these issues are incredibly disappointing.
---
This game is basically unplayable at this point. We paid for this, please fix it.
---
Also I [crudely marked the factions](https://i.imgur.com/tVLg4hU.jpg) so you can see.
---
I think that should be the trade off do you want a more remote camp to access resources or do you put your camp somewhere on the beaten path to sell to other players
---
Pvp against scrubs geared for pve will make you think that.
---
Everything a melee build does a gun build can do better.
---
There is no perk that reduces gun damage specifically by 45%
---
Not heard of that at all.. Worth a ticket for sure.. Post the number etc and see if you can't get a community manager to respond 
---
Bleed is something that's very underrated, and the Mole Miner Gauntlet's got it with its extra blade mod.
---
yea the poses are complete garbage since they are photo mode only.
---
just make a secondary emote window, when you select the current emotes in the game press another button to switch/flip to the good emotes redial thing.
---
its way to convoluted to open map(can take more then 5 seconds at times), press button for photomode, press button to switch tab then scroll down to poses and then scroll thru the poses
---
What is bleed?
---
lol no, two shots were in no way close to the damage you can output with a melee build or another combo of damage boosting perks. Most weapons with a two shot effect makes them VIABLE not over powered. Ghouls still taking three or 4 shots to kill with several perks to boost damage ( thinking of rifles specifically ) does not compare to any random super sledge one shotting any of em. 
---
It honestly made a lot of weapons useful in a lot of scenarios where they might not be otherwise. Like my two shot 10mm auto pistol is actually pretty versatile. We'll see how it goes but I could see even more weapon types becoming less useful for every day use. You could argue that a buff could help regular guns be more viable but that seems unlikely at least for the time being
---
First step to curing is admit you have a problem...
---
Yes we gathered that 16 minutes ago.
---
Nah all of those are pretty common actually 👍
---
Yeah that’s my worry. All it takes is one asshole. 
---
Ok, its not polite to throw that information out there and not provide the image!
---
I personally found her to be one of the most annoying parts of the MQ.
---
No, the quest always grants some more common items like chems or ammo, while the 1\* combat armor pieces or the BoS cosmetics are somewhat rarer.
---
I'm telling you the bobblehead stacking to kill with slap damage is a thing, and camp size DOES increase with level. You're spitting lies through your teeth. And melee tops damage wise. Nobody is specifically talking about PvP, moreso the future pve content that'll be ruined because everyone is either using melee, or doing sub optimal DPS.
---
You sure you're looking at your character?
---
Compare them to other gun mods not melee weapons. Melee weapons need to get balanced as well
---
This. Honestly, using TSE has its own challenges and dealing with melee is one of them.
---
I always wear the veil, not as fashion, just plain fear to sell it and get problems with completing the quest.
---
I had that messages poping up all the time: "your gear prevented you from catching airborne dieease" and i thought it was strange my gasmask in the inventory was somehow saving me although i never actively wear it...
---
Another 0.1 freed in my inventory, thanks OP!
---
Yep. It's glorious. Just make it spit out Salisbury Steak nonstop and you can stop living off that stockpile of dogfood that you have sitting around
---
Go melee like everyone else? its easy to kill her without op TES guns...
---
Last night was the most I blue screened on any day playing thus far. At one point 4l5 times in less than 15 minutes.
---
Today I only blue screened once in nearly 6 hours of playing on the same server.
---
Three Dog 4 Lyfe
---
I only have 1 character, and no one else uses it. I’m know it’s mine too because it’s the exact uniform I ran when I was lower leveled.
---
Ya you know what the problem is better than paid testers and devs
---
Big changes are really awkward for builds, but at least they gave a warning and you have time to rebuild SPECIAL.
---
Yeah most of the weapons suck for the stronger enemies. But every so often I go back to the forest to look around and that’s when the underpowered fun weapons get taken out of the stash box. I really like my hasty .38 combat rifle. 
---
You should have included some examples. How does perk loadout or seeing known plans would make the game too easy and boring?
---
The game is fun. The problem is that it was a buggy pile of shit on launch day. In fact, it is still the buggiest AAA game that I own. So... yeah.
---
I love this game, but it still needs months of polish.
---
The problem I see is we still need more people per server and more even more stash space to begin with. Then Top of the World and Hub76 could basically be like the Motorcycle Club and CEO of GTA V. They both have their own unique propose, but they’re both kinda similar. They do different things tho, 
---
Top of the World could be used to sell more decretive loot like weapons and armor under the raider faction 
---
Hub 76 could sell stuff more like supplies and plans. They’ll both be relevant areas this way. Not mentioning the Top of the World one is still in-server while Hub76 would be outside of the server as OP said in another comment.
---
i would just want lockpick or hacker cards legendary versions, card costs 1 point but act as if all 3 were equipped
---
You just hit the g-spot of fallout suggestions
---
Make you think what?
---
no
---
Acording to this sub people duplicating items are the ones who crash the servers, I don't know first hand since I've stopped playing during christmas
---
Not even sure why you got downvoted on this...
---
Could you imagine a buttercup skin for the supersledge?   That's just adding insult to injury when the mobs recognize the smiling face on the death weapon.
---
With a board?
---
My tears are only cause this game is such an abomination and a disgrace to the fallout franchise. I pre-ordered this piece of garbage, hell I pre-ordered the Tricentennial edition because I hoped this would be good. I don't want the game to fail but it already has. I wanted this to be a great game (still do) but Bethesda is just incompetent. Leaving exploits like this in for MONTHS when they were reported in BETA, not doing anything about it for months, then without notice just banning people left and right is fucked up.
---
That said, I never duped, never cheated in this game and I don't condone it either but since the game itself is a mess and unfun to play with no real end game, I completely understand why people would like to make their own fun in the game by any means possoble. Also, most of these cheat methods have been in fucking Fallout 4 for fuck's sake..... How do you not fix them before releasing a multiplayer version of the game??? 
---
max starched genes and class freak if you haven't already and you want to have permanent mutations. Super duper and ammosmith and Chemist are all really good perks as well.

There are some automated turrets in Harper's Ferry that shoot explosive rounds. The turrets always respawn in the same location. Not sure if it's intended but boy do they pack a punch.
---
You've been clicking on the other special stats then tabbing over to pick the perk card.
---
You can put a point in strength then pick a luck perk on the same level, the special rank just goes into whichever you picked first before you started looking at perks
---
That's actually a really good idea. I would like new events to be added because I keep grinding the same ones over and over again.
---
okay i have the  Hunter's Long Coat but where on earth did you get the Longshoreman Outfit?
---
Dislike
---
Eh, Explo will still be the most desired secondary effect. Only difference is that meta will shift from TSE to AA-E (which was already better for shotguns) and BL-E. TSE will still be good though, just not the king of the hill it was.
---
Bleed damage causes the enemy to take additional damage for a short period after you hit them. 
---
Oh ok that makes sense Goddamit im upset lmao thanks 
---
I believe I got that from the roaming vendor bot
---
I never said necessary. You play video games for necessity? Or for fun? Curious
---
That’ll be a real aggravation though around popular spots as even slight overlap in camps will cause one to not be placed. I could see this being a headache around Whitesprings and Flatwoods. 
---
Usually driven to this thread in frustration, but I'm encouraged by the inside the vault repeatedly emphasizing contribution of feedback. I've complained about not having enough to do late-game in the past, and while I would still love more content I have found some staying power in certain Events. Im enjoying Monster Mash (even though I play it alone every time) and Lode Bearing especially. Monster Mash is a legit challenge that I enjoy, lode bearing is made complete by having to dart from the shaft before dying. Token/candy collection mechanism for these Events set a long term goal for me. Once I accomplish getting the top tier rewards for these though, I probably will stop playing them. 
---
Breach and clear is another quest I will do every time it appears. The ore is useful, but truthfully I'm only playing it repeatedly to get the Ancient Sword which I've read online is available as a quest reward. I've seemingly played this event one hundred times and i still haven't gotten the sword. I frankly am sick of it at this point, but continue to play it for that sword. If I were you guys I'd put more unique rewards like this sword in your events, players like me will apparantly grind the dumbest things if there's a unique reward. The tokens from these quests are far more enjoyable than the chore-like Mr. Fuzzy dailys. 
---
Other events I keep an eye out for are Horde events. I like that  these *Kill the X leader* quests consistently spawn legendary leader enemies. If more people knew this, more people would play them. It's disappointing that the level of these enemies is soley based on geography though, if I'm the only person playing an event it would be cool for the rewards and difficulty to scale. 
---
Rewards for most events seem really random. For that reason the only other Events that even come to mind are highly unique experiences like Heart of the Swamp or Guided Meditation. These are 2 very cool experiences that deserve unique rewards. For completion rewards I always appreciate plans since I find enjoyment in building. Some players may not feel the same way. I have never received a useful piece of legendary armor from an event and feel like those should be gotten rid of or improved somehow. Suffice to say I appreciate the events for their content more than their rewards. 
---
Heart of the Enemy is also worth mentioning, as well as the cryptid related daily quests. The cryptids offer a unique end game unmarked completionist-quest, and the Heart of the Enemy feels comprehensive because of traversing the map. Both should be playable at will, today I went to both trigger locations and it did nothing.
---
Overall I like how the events offer replayable quests. I think more should have their own unique rewards. More tokens and long term rewards would be cool as well. A unique perk card for communing with the moth man? Scorchbeast Princess event over Harper's Ferry? Also workshop defense shouldn't be flagged as an event either IMO, it just doesn't fit the mold and only serves to flag a workbench on the map for aggressive players. 
---
LOL.  I love how they got a bone cutter and surgical tray on the medical bed as well!
---
Oh that makes sense that’s annoying lmao Goddamit ... thanks for your help 
---
idk why you're being downvoted this is the primary reason something like this would be extremely difficult to implement, it could cause a lot of issues for virtually zero benefit outside of a little extra convenience that not everyone has a big problem with anyways.. The game has no way of knowing if it can place your camp or not until you're already on the server and in the game, it's a little silly to think something like this is feasible. It would put a severe and unnecessary tax on the already unstable servers and greatly increase initial load times
---
It's not a bad *idea*, i actually like it and if it were possible i think most people would agree it would be a nice convenience, but it's just too much of a completely unrealistic pipe dream to be considered a real suggestion 
---
I just found it lol and if my math is right this pretty much makes it on par with the rest of the mods and just made melee the go to now as it pretty much just destroyed any heavy weapons being viable also. I can see furious and bloody being the new top perk maybe anti armor also depending on the situation. Explosive might still be worth it in the second slot maybe but now there’s other options. Now from the looks of it maxed out damage everything will be a bullet sponge now.
---
Meanwhile bloodied build with nerd rage etc become the new meta 
---
Yeah it's kinda confusing for sure
---
I replied to the wrong person, my bad.
---
Ppl are circle jerking around melee thinking tse is the only counter but their out to lunch.
---
Got my upvote!
---
I'm 87 and finally think I have unbuggered my Build, but theres still some non-combat stuff I want. Had to swap around like 5 or 6 perks, and had to buy low level cards of stuff I already had maxxed. I wish i'd known exactly where i wanted to end up so I didn't waste as many points earlier in the game. The fact you can't take 2 level 1 cards and Use them without upgrading them is kinda BS. Some of the best perks are 3-5 levels, and it sucks when your already at 5 and decide your really ok with 3 or 4 and need to start over. Next character won't have the same problem. 
---
Is there a PvP mode on Fallout 76...?
---
Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, YES.
---
Tbh I dont think those cards should have ever been part of the regular selection of perk cards. So many other games have utility and crafting skills separated from any that impact the combat. Ideas for perk loadouts are good, but I think they're ultimately just a workaround for a flawed idea. Combat perks and utility/crafting ones should have been separated from the start.
---
Been there done that. Hurts bad. Had like 4-5 level 2's that i realized I'd be better with ones also. 
---
Throw in a monorail time machine and the content available is limitless
---
First of all, I'm not a kid so watch your tone. Second, I can admit being wrong about that one thing. However I swear it has happened to me and I play solo 90% of the time. Third, your other points are still utter bullshit.
---
Its inhospitable but not impossible to set up a shop for a day
---
Be happy, it's still a weapon with bonus damage considerable enough to be far superior to the non-legendary variant... So much so that it's still OP.
---
Christ, I'm tired of this yapping. So you'll need to shoot something 2-3 times instead of 1. Boo-fucking-hoo.
---
TSE will still be good, quit with the drama.
---
I get the explosive radius running down but God the damage tho 25 percent from 100 make it 50 cause some people have spent time in their game to get good weapons with twoshot explosive and that much for nothing good anymore 
---
could just select how many stars you want to use when equipping it. Would make changing your build up way easier. 
---
Or get rid of the bobbleheads that's what players are using to one shot everything 
---
Thanks a lot. So,  there ARE issues with gauss - just as i thought. A pity, the weapon is strong. 
---
Next week you’ll be penalised for owning one. 
---
This would probably be the worst patch ever Bethesda 
---
Ah yeah I've seen all the other items countless times just the actual explorer's coat that I've seen twice, I just can't remember where it was that I found them haha. 
---
Travel Agent is handy during end-game because I dont tent to wander around on foot much and explore.  I pop around to specific places now.
---
I was able to search online and found a site that allows you to "build" your character with a graphic interface and select the cards as you would in game.  Doing that allowed me to see what I would like to end up as and how I would do it.  I do not currently have the link to the site but it was like Fallout 76 builder or something.   Looks pretty much like leveling up in the game.  Try it out and you will see what perks you want to do.
---
Yea I know it's going to be the worst and actually not penalised just madly disappointed on the patch it's literally the worst one their gonna do out of them all
---
Melee can still get really high damage numbers and 75% armor penetration, and then instigating or bloodied and 40% power attack, could one shot even with a lot of damage resists and perks. But I don't know. If you're talking about sentinel assassin armor sure. It's pretty rare though and it makes pretty much every weapon or build useless. But you still need to get close. Maybe with a stealth boy or something. And if you can stagger the target then that negates the standing effect.
---
I'm sure a quick Google search could probably tell ya
---
Actually, i would reroll on that server even if i don't like pvp in fallout. Just so everyone don't have TSE weapon and duplicate gear all over the place. Bring back the economy and fairness !
---
Kremvhs tooth making a comeback XD
---
Uh... no.  I have no desire to start a new character in this game- ever. Low levels are a tedious grind and I refuse to do it again.
---
Oh man imagine a vendor that allows you to purchase time on a radio station to talk to broadcast the auction so that people out questing can TP when they hear an item that they may want. Also could be used for genral fuckery and make people laugh. If you dont want to listen then just change the station. But it would be cool to have some sort of connection to players no matter where you are in the wasteland
---
Do you have a screenshot?
---
The best is probably a maxed bloodied normal sledge with faster swing speed, at least for the two handed weapons. because it does only 10 base-dmg less than All Rise.
---
I was WONDERING what pylon v8 was. You just solved it.
---
Until they decide how they are going to handle the broken PvP (and not just removing bobblestacks) I don't want to be anywhere near a hub. I can peruse through LFG posts for anyone selling junk or legendaries, and I'm just used to throwing away 1 stars and overstocked junk at this point because it's not worth the caps to go out and sell to all these vendors.
---
I feel like this started as a survival game, and it's clear to me that the survival part is just annoying and not actually difficult or engaging as a mechanic (survival was great in Vegas). Having a hub doesn't really fit their lore, but then again, neither does the last 3 decades of established fallout history.
---
The clean spacesuit helmet you can find in game still has the -2 perception though. 
---
Nah my game kicked me off as soon as I grabbed it I still have it but I already called it quits I've you have an Xbox 1 I can show you it 
---
I would prefer having it like heavy wood plank armour, and you could have nails poking out of it that damage the enemy when they get close to you
---
If you have an Xb1
---
I do, but I'd venture to guess it's not for trade
---
only problem with that is if that person leaves the server or the server crashes, you lose ur stuff. I have two pc's running, my crap one i remote desktop to on another screen so they are side by side. I use xbox controller on the crap pc so i can give the illusion that two people are playing at the same time :D 
---
In recent news of people getting banned for exploits and dupes. Do you think they will target people with second accounts at all (just storing items legitimately)?
---
You literally confirmed exactly what i said in my comment to which you called me an idiot.
---
Its super close to the junk node I was using sadly. I want a junk node base but they all seem enemy occupied.
---
During my play through, I had adjusted my core to a different weapon.  So had to regain all my cards for that.  Now I changed weapons again and have to get like 9-10 levels worth of cards again.   So my core has changed a few times since started and I am level 128.   I am working to changing it yet again because changing from sniper stealth to medium/close range stealth auto whatever-you-want-to-call-it (commando?).   So I need about 15 more perk cards and 2 more point shifts.
---
Yea sorry I found it on my heavy gunner build and since I have a sneaky sniper build I was gonna trade it with him 
---
Why? Those mods made ranged weapon a reasonable choice instead of melee. I admit that it's in lieu actual buffs or nerfs to balance them out but unless they're doing a comprehensive balance update at once they're effectively taking away the things that made guns comparable. 
---
Obviously you could probably make some guns useful with a lot of specific perks for specific builds that require a certain spec. With melee currently I find they pretty devastating even with no melee specific perks. If I'm going to be forced to pick a specific gun build I want I'd need to potentially spec myself out of other builds. 
---
You don't **need** a TSE for playing solo. Maybe you should adjust your play style and perk cards. I've never had issues with killing as a solo player, the only real "issue" is having enough crafting materials for .50 cal or 5.56 ammo.
---
I got a feeling the ppl with that stuff are going to stay away from the pvp mode as they won't want to face players running the same setups.
---
Why fish in the ocean when you can fish in a barrel.
---
Owwwwwwwww!
---
I get that's how it works in a mmo but you're missing my point I think. What makes the super rare tse weapon meta? The fact that it was duped to hell yo the point oversaturation. People then are getting griefed by people with not only the tse but the stat boosters that are also duped allowing crazy damage outputs that many people think is solely the use of tse. If duped stuff was all removed this would reduce the issue and others at hand. Plus I dont know about it still being as strong as you say. It's a 75% damage decrease for two shot and a 80% on exploding shot. This sounds really weak for legendary that naturally spawns pretty rarely.  All of what I was trying to say is the nerf may not be needed it the dups where removed 1st.
---
It's to make other gun prefixes viable at all, otherwise there's no real point in having anything besides two shot. 
---
Melee definitely needs to be fixed and will be at some point, but balancing doesn't all happen in one patch
---
I wouldn't mind finding some recordings of the unstoppables or silver shroud broadcasts
---
Bugs in this game cant stop amasing me. Make a tech support ticket, i am sure there is something about in on the server side.
---
Mine was 50 when I scrapped it, it's still rubbish
---
Where can I find info like that on these weapons ?
---
Instead of discard, have the cards give 10 Card Points.  Add in a store where you can spend 30 Card Points for any card.
---
Me too. Would give me some extra income.
---
They never said that there is going to be new PVP servers or they updated news on that? And if they did, they f#cking stupid. I am not interested playing game all over again. I would choosen PVP from release, but after I have been done quest and seen all the stuff in normal server, It is f#cking stupid to start playing again in other server. 
---
You people are so afraid of dying it's pathetic.  Bet you bowl with the bumpers up too.  Gitgud
---
I should defo try at least an non PA character and maybe make it a stealth build too. 
---
From what I know, especially in 76, heavy weapons are not worth it (at least non legendary ones that I've picked up). Some do OK damage like a missile launcher but the weight of the weapon and the ammo isn't worth it for me, and with the minigun the damage is really low especially compared to some base melee weapons. 
---
Flamer Fuel does seem rare in 76 especially coming from New Vegas where I've got so much I basically use it for trading so as not to waste my caps lol
---
Or... Vault 76 opened up and you get to meet the first human NPC in the game, as a vendor.
---
.
---
The Overseer.
---
I would love an option to make your camp 'broadcastable' on your pipboy, so anyone can fast travel, and stock up on supplies.
---
This intern with a venderbot you can setup in your camp would be freaking awesome.
---
Wait... so you're telling me it's not to easy and boring already?
---
Thank you I thought it was bug because it's like two radaway and 24 .38 rounds Everytime. 
---
Yeah they're not going to do it all at once but I wonder how long we'll be stuck with it as is. After the TS I'm just expecting the differences between the two widen further. 
---
I expect it all to change several times it's just frustrating what it feel like before they get around to it. 
---
Yes I was thinking the same, even with the nerf TSE will still be OP. Guess we need to wait and see.
---
they should make a server everyone all SPECIAL on 10, no perks, no legendary weapons
---
I think this is a damn good idea. I have kind of stopped playing but a good reason like a dedicated PVP server with all new characters would be fun. 
---
that ones available at 26 I think. i got it early, and maxxed hard bargain also. I used it as early as possible so I could make caps selling to all the vendors. 
---
Its more so they could gate what level you could hack/pick stuff, as otherwise you could take the base card three times at level 5 or whatever and just rank it up. Each card only says "raises your picking/hacking level by one" IIRC so I wonder if you could actually in a party of three each share the first card and be at level 3
---
There is apparently a blue house down the street from a fire station that you can build inside. Sorry for being enigmatic but that's all I can remember :D
---
I just found an armor piercing explosive hunting rifle!  Boom!!
---
Dont tell me about random in this game. Trappers chest drops to me from every possible sourse, molerats, frogs, scorchbeasts, robot, all this creatures fucking love to have damn trapper chest with them. Same with power armor, it's pain to try to find pieces you need, it's always the same ones in different locations and NEVER EVER a full set, even if it is against logic and common sence, like raider armor inside of closed govenment base.
---
So much this! Very well said. 2 shot moddifier makes no since if its only rly a 1.25 shot that's dumb, but people gotta bitch and moan they got killed by a TSE so Bethesdas gotta balance. In my opinion a better way to balance it would be not to nerf dmg of either effect just don't allow them to both be together. Rly hope we can change Bethesdas mind on this one before this patch rolls out.
---
Some weapons will state that it has the effect. I know Talons, the mutation, gives your unarmed attacks the Bleed effect. 
---
While i agree on the basic idea, it is hard to do because even with non legendary items you can doom stack yourself into a killing machine
---
Ok, yes, you have a great point.   A Radium rifle is not optimum for any PVE at all.   I was thinking about the TSE Shotguns/BP Rifles/The Dragon/Gauss...
---
I have 250+ hours into the game and I do not care one bit if they erased all items in the game to fix the exploited situation.  I can easily get a few scrap and build a new Handmade pretty fast as well as make some leathers.   My downtime would be minimal.
---
Well worth that IMO than the current state, but I can see how some would not like that option.
---
How about give explosive dmg a full nerf, and nerf the amount of dmg two shot does to players only?
---
two shot is fine, it only becomes an issue when it is paired with explosive.
---
People with that setup want to pvp though. And one negative of dodgy is fast firing weapons that will drain AP so fast. If you're on a team somebody could drain their AP from range, while the melee stealth character gets close.
---
I'll be able to replace my two-shot .44 with a plain western revolver without losing any damage.
---
I did just find a vampire's western, so that's better than nothing.
---
It doesnt exist. Wood only goes up to 1*. 
---
850 hours? You ok hun? 
---
I’m kinda obsessed with this game in what I consider to be an unhealthy way and have clocked up 125 hours since beta, damn new baby and wife demanding attention and that!!!
---
But then I’m not here to judge. This was a great read, keep up the good fight brother and take the odd trip outside, man needs the snacks and shit.
---
So you are all for exploiters being able to 1 shot those who dont wish to engage in PVP?
---
It may have started as a online RPG but it does not need to stay JUST an online RPG. Beth will need to impliment content and systems that attract new players and IMHO with the bad press the game has gotten they may need to move towards a few more familiar MMO style systems in game. It's Beths game they can take this game any direction they want afterall.
---
prestige mode?
---
He probably means the codes, not the keycards. Probably buys the keycards or has a friend shoot it down. 
---
Ahh, I see. Thanks for the response! 
---
Yes. Very. The sneak speed boost alone is awesome. 
---
Yes all the time, I had my jetpack torso come off when I stepped in to go into a nuke zone (not realising since I was in 1st person) and I was getting rads like crazy before I realised the problem and equipped it in armour, I’m just glad it’s an easy fix
---
crouching up and down is universal language for being friendly. Even in Rust (PC game) crouching up and down means your friendly.
---
100% agree, but if we don't reply, and don't give in to them, they will stop.
---
We can't change their opinions, since their opinion is most likely already set in stone.
---
Ignore them.
---
Just take them out of the game completely.  They literally are garbage loot with no use. 
---
Im with you on that one. I have an instigating deathclaw with the third claw and pretty much one shot everything if its at full health.
---
*nutbuster
---
Either way, I hope we have stuff to do. I don't really PVP cause it isn't worth it. Hopefully we can actually fight of huge resource deposits is towns that allow certain features while holding them would probably get me to fight more. 
---
If it were zones you could potentially make the whole zone capturable or give people a reason to venture in an risk getting raided. Just like with everything we'll just have to see. Really high amounts of resources would make me tempted to kill someone else I know if farming a certain resource cause... Gimme 
---
Yes I do agree. However it is 2019 and we have seen hundreds of game run auction houses by now. Look at why the great ones are great and why the bad ones flopped and we should be able to find one that works well for this game.
---
One more comment on this topic, because those two posts must be seen by Bethesda. Helping the whole server is something almost everyone want. It give the feeling that you have done something for your world.
---
Contractor is very good as well.  Especially get it to rank 2 prior to building the radiation arch.
---
Instigating your only getting the bonus on the first bullet that hits, where TSE is every bullet that hits.....
---
This was a good, quick read. Very cool. 
---
What do you think? Still think melee is worthless?
---
Without the ability to choose servers, this wouldn’t work out well for casuals, constantly bouncing around not knowing how the claims are on their server. 
---
As to making territory claims, how about a modified version of the workshops. Place a workshop at key locations that, when claimed, are claimed for the faction not an individual player and allow any in the faction to add to the structure. This would require a degree of server permanence and would also add to the whole “rebuilding America” aspect that Vault-Tec intended for the residents of 76. 
---
Probably Charleston. Only actually fire house I know. I'll have to check it out. Hopefully we can make whole bunkers eventually.
---
If you weren't aware Morgantown red rocket is completely usable for some reason. There's also water out back. Right across the street from the high school 
---
Well then why In the hell would we have the knowledge to modify the SAMs to shoot down nukes, and why would you want to stop people launching on prime since the turrets are only in the cranberry bog and it’s purely your fault if you place your camp in high nuke areas such as prime or whitesprings it would just be a dick move really
---
On a side note can anyone tell me how to get the raider tag beside my name in this subreddit 
---
Are they making PvP servers!?
---
Yes so this is what I'm imagining: you fast travel to this marker. You then enter a loading screen as you load in this "zone." This is actually hosted on a separate several to save resources and allow even more players to participate. When you load into this zone, there is PvP enabled constantly and this zone could have fantastic loot, objectives with great rewards, faction stuff, etc.
---
Doesn't that sound better than just separate PvP servers?
---
I've played the stresstest on Xbox, I've played every second of the Beta and I've played every day ever since. I didn't check, but I must have played around 400 hours+ No game since The Division 1 has had this effect on me.   
---
How is it possible to have so much fun with a "shithole of a game"? I mean, the game must be shitty, because the Internet sais so.
---
Most likely Nuka Cola even has Nuclear Waste in it!
---
2 star ammo-smith and 3 star super duper is pretty good for making ammo, and super duper works with anything you make, so stacks with chemist and presumably making weapons and armor (haven't made any since I got it)
---
Yea and the game already is boring and easy. This why majority players play few days, be done with quest, launch a nuke and they are done playing. Thats why no one really streams it. There is no interesting content them to play and people to watch. Streamers last desperate attempt to make game more entertaining for their viewers was "Permadeath". F76 lifespan is 5 times smaller than housefly's. 
---
I don't want to lose the current server set up. I like the soft pvp elements, I can focus on pve and hunt bounties on the side. Some people however want the current mode to become completely passive.
---
Two Shot will still give a blanket 25% increase, 15% more than mutated, 5% less than the enemy specific boosts but applicable to all enemies. Is it weaker yes, but the nerf simply makes it more inline with other modifiers. Explosive with still apply to all projectiles fired and will still be buffed by demo expert. So a TSE will still do 45% bonus damage to all enemies before perks with AOE. In most situations that will still be the strongest combo on a gun. You can look at it as a nerf or you can look at it for what it is: a rebalancing that makes other legendary modifiers actually viable.   
---
I get it people are upset that their strongest weapon in the game will no longer be the strongest by the same margin. But the weapons needed rebalanced. "Nerfing" two modifiers is a hell of a lot simpler than buffing the other 30 and will help the overall health of the game.
---
Besides the Caps from them, whats the big deal?
---
Exactly my point. What about the people that have hundreds of hours and farmed a lot to get their two-shot or TSE weapons? Screw us ,right? Melee does almost the same damage as a TSE weapon ,why not deal with that too? What about the stackable bobbleheads? Duppers have thousands of those 
---
Isn't whitespring almost this?
---
Pretty sure OP is referring to vendors not other players
---
In all honesty missile turrets for me do work quite well actually, the thing is that I don't understand why they are so budget taxing and even various models using more budget than others when they clearly use the same A.I. (Turret vs Heavy Turret for example). They should just add a hard cap if they are so scared about them causing server instability. 
---
I would be happy with an idle animation. Would make for cool pictures. 
---
The could ask bethesda to make a whole new game instead 😂
---
iirc it's made inhospitable through the use of poisonous gas. in the OP (s)he said to make a level 50 quest to hack the vault and turn off that system and clean up whatever mess it made. So the gameplay would be spawn in vault -&gt; leave vault -&gt; do story and side missions/rebuild america -&gt; ultimately nuke the scorch queen to save the world -&gt; hack the vault to make it hospitable again, since now there's another nuke-level event to warrant having a vault. Lore wise it makes sense, and if you want to be picky, then say that once we make it hospitable we realize that we don't need the vault anyways because we've mutated so much when we left, so instead of living in the vault we just make it a community hub.
---
With pvp servers raiding will hopefully be an established practice. I actually like the idea of tense encounters especially if such zones have highlly concentrated resources or areas you know someone is scavving in. 
---
Being a Hitman could be annoying cause it'll likely just come off as greifing to the victim. Could be cool as an actual mechanic. Like you get warned you're being hunted and the Hitman can join your server but not see you on the map or just give them a general area of the map to hunt in 
---
Heart warming moment.
---
It's especially lonely for lone wanderers like me. I get excited when I come across few people at WS Gold club for farming XP...but they just leave right after. I always stick around to maybe trade things or in hopes that they signal me with a "follow me" emote but nope. I end up going back to my crappy base nearby to resupply and hop servers. I'm only Level 28. 
---
It happens when you an extra piece of armor that’s not equipped like a chest piece and such in your inventory. 
---
Well theres your chance to get 8 nuclear keycards at once! 
---
Playing on ps4 pro, and the last 2 scorchbeast queens I've participated in haven't dropped any loot. I'm fully participating and doing my share of damage. I get rewards for completing the event but no loot from the actual corpse. Very frustrating. 
---
I change my mind from minute to minute. One minute I'm angry, next minute I'm understanding. If a Bethesda dev read my comments they would think I hate them and everything they do. That's not true, but passions are high at times when bomnbshells drop and some people just like the drama and having some fun in these turbulent times. I could have been asking for this nerf for months, and when it drops I;m like WTF are you doing. But you just have to take every comment with a pinch of salt. I really do love the game, and I like to take unpopular opinions and vent sometimes about stuff that is really winding me up,
---
I camp near by, so I see those bots every time I play. All they’re good for is annoying the scorched that hang around the roof tops.
---
Awesome!  Down with the TSE!
---
i just want end game content man. 
---
Change user flair
---
I'd wait to see what else comes with the patch. They gave us a peak, not the keys to the house.
---
That said, even if they don't come now, a step is still a step.
---
Happened to me too once. Clean underwear was in order after the lights came up and I was in an elevator with a wendigo.
---
What if we could build a [robot constructor](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oEyVvrc4mEA/maxresdefault.jpg) which build a vendor bot who hang around your camp (large zone) or you can define and area he's patrolling in. You could make him walk in whitespring/forest/Watoga ect..
---
It would work with the lore too. Just make a small quest for us to be able to craft it and you're good
---
It don't show your base location, he can get some item to sell and maybe even buy ? Like you ask for springs and set a price of 5, give the vendor 1000 caps and other players could sell their springs at the price you want.
---
Find me a video of someone one shotting someone else in pacifist mode, that's not at a workshop. Someone that didn't engage in the person one shotting them at all. 
---
They're not saying they approve of exploiters. You're part of the problem with this overly dramatic nonsense. You should work for online news blogs with the way you spin things. You'd be a pro at making headlines/titles. 
---
oh that's hilarious, I had no idea haha I found it hilarious. Thanks for letting me know...
---
Stop grinding and start exploring and you’ll have your loot back faster than you expect. 
---
What is that item never heard of that hmmmmmm
---
Wait wood's does something useful?
---
Look at the trade value too
---
becuase explosive part not because two shot.
---
Personally i'm running a primed Gauss rifle with adrenal reaction, full rifle dmg perks,  bloody mess, and nerd rage, it reaches 700+ dmg per shot. (according to the pipboy) when I'm down to 20% health. I try to keep my health that level by having 80% rad on me so i don't over heal.
---
If i run my unyielding set (up to +3 all stat the lower hp you have) i can reach 30 luck and eat a scorchbeast liver i reach 33 luck.
---
33 luck gives me full crit meter each shot using crit savvy.
---
furthermore blight soup +20% crit dmg, eagle eyes +25% crit dmg &amp; better criticals +40% crit dmg
---
Result: 700 dmg per shot Gauss rifle +85% crit damage and 100% crit per shot.
---
If i remember to take psycho chems on the regular i reach even more damage.
---
I can see my shots take 1/30 to 1/40 of the queens health bar during 8\~ player present.
---
(however i do have 1 legendary effect on the gauss rifle, zealot (30% more damage to scorched) and with the weapon being primed it also has a 20\~% dmg increase to scorched)
---
(And i'm trying to use stealth to gain some sneak shots (2.5x dmg) and keep myself alive by not being targeted)

---
Also whenever i launch a nuke at the primed site, i graze the primed site by placing the nuke up north sparing sparing the southern part from radiation, enabling me to sit in the forward station delta.
---
Ot shoots 25% more bullet per bullet!
---
I know right
---
You have the same issues with Fallout 4. Nothing changed. And 76 isn't even modded yet, so... 
---
Must be a legendary effect?
---
Yes 
---
There were two mirelurk queens there when I found it. Great location though. 
---
I gotta agree with this. One of the things I disliked the most about WoW when I recently went back was everything scaling. Dammit no, I just wanna go farm some shit on ezmode wtf. 
---
&gt; This why majority players play few days, be done with quest, launch a nuke and they are done playing.
---
You base this on what?
---
Damn... all I got were a few insects and mole rats lol
---
Got me too. They should have had a notice of some kind since this was not considered a pvp action in the past and picking locks and taking things in the game is part of the game. Also users call in supply drops to help new players all the time.
---
I said hilarious twice. I'm tired. good night)))
---
Thanks to you, that snallygaster can now partake in long range spitting olympics without killing anyone :)
---
"Calling all Responders! Sanjay here. Mama Dolche's has finished churning out food for everyone. Can any spare hands get to the provisioning station? Just in case people get a little rowdy in line."
---
Event Quest "Get It While It's Hot!" will start, which will be either outside Dolche's or in Morgantown airport, consisting of a tent with crates of the canned food and several protectrons guarding what would be a queue. Event will cause Schorched, Ghouls and other nasties to attack the post with calm periods in-between for non-combatants to grab their food. Rewards could be extra food, plans for responder gear, maybe water too.
---
I have crashed a total of 2 times out of my 50 hours of game play on ps4 pro
---
in rdr2 you can buy contracts on people. that would be a really awesome in game mechanic on 76. I do enjoy raiding peoples workshops. i do have a tse but prefer using my grognak axe for the challenge. but this has backfired on me a couple times. once a guy dropped a ton of screwz, like 50. just dropped them. i collected and ran back to base as anyone would do lol. he followed and leveled my base with his 2 shot grenade launher hahaha. i was pissed but i mean i was the instagater so...
---
Personally I don't think I need for it to be on the same server/world. I'm not a huge fan of getting workshops. There's little keeping me on one server than another but for a lot of users that would be great especially when playing with friends ( of which I have none)  Greatest wish is just an actual struggle between forces like long term flippable strongholds. Which I could see implemented in PVP zones and the way you've proposed could work for that  
---
Lol funny
---
About  the legendaries,  i think every normal weapon could become a legendary based  on how much its being used. *  legendaries need 5000 kills, ** legendaries 20 000 and *** 500 000 for example.
---
So ppl would do more effort to reach their kills, and when you earn a legendary star you can choose your own perk for it like TS or E
---
So instead of searching for hours for good legendary loot it would be more exploring and killing creatures or pvp. 
---
Must be where they spawn. Are all these nuke card carriers or just supply drop bots?  The nuke card guys usually have escorts. 
---
Now the 2-3 star items that get dumped in bags are way better!  There ya go, improved 50 items by nerfing just 2 effects!
---
"Can't let everyone have all the crazy good stuff on the new PvP server; much better to have a few people that quickly grind up to being unkillable gods with setninel assassin armor and bend literally everyone else with nothing over effortlessly."
---
Nothing extra in my inventory. Any pieces I have are on the frame
---
I can imagine if you repeatedly run the silo's and queen you get low on ammo. It's supposed to be the hardest pve content and together with pvp it also costs me the most resources, in exchange for great rewards like prime plans. I too mostly need to stock up a bit after the queen event. I never not saw her die so far though, except several times through disconnects. I'm on PC btw. I'd say it's normal she costs a lot of resources and it's not normal to just do those events time and time again without doing other things on the map.
---
Yesterday I fought her 3 times, the last time with only 2 lvl 100+'s while all the others and me were below 100 but we got her to die nicely. She landed only once and after her regen we had to shoot her out of the sky. Right after she died one team started to fight my team right on the spot. I lost my junk from it but did acquire 450 caps from the fight.
---
I don't question your experience, but with my team we haven't encountered any problems with her except disconnects.
---
Try the blocker perk and level out endurance a bit to get life give and always be well fed for bonus 50 hp
---
2 handed weapon build and reflective plates is a pretty solid build for endgame too.
---
Yep, man's using Bloodied as a comparison.
---
When a TSE can also use Adrenal and Unyielding.
---
Lol.   Not even sure how that one works!
---
Kill a group of mobs and heal your whole team?
---
The same goes for level 3 locked loot. I noticed in Fallout 4 for some reason they started putting the most useless loot behind locked doors or in locked storage. 
---
FO76 is so much worse. It’s so frustrating to change your damn perk cards and open up a level 3 locked container to find a pencil and a wrench. Or even worse with locked doors that you think might be important that are closets with a locked tool chest with the same sad loot. 
---
I’ve seen the item floating before but never been able to pick it up. Interesting. 
---
All they know is that people are complaining that they are being killed while in pacifist mode by two shot explosive shotguns there op and should be removed they say. Not realizing that those people are actually being killed by some one who has stacked 20 explosive bobble heads and the TSE shotgun is just the easy out. the insta kills will still happen. Although now all us regular players who play the game as interested get massively nerfed and all our hard work grinding is wasted and enemies will become bullet sponges. What they needed to do was.
---
 1 stop bobble head stacking 
---
 2 reduce pvp damage by like 60 percent
---
so fights actually feel engaging and back and forth even with these explosive and two shit nerfs I still one shot pvp while seizing a workshop. Because I use a melee build that does 950 damage a swing because that is balanced. 
---
Compared to my 1* legendary 2shot .50cal it was good not broken not weak just good now it’s vendor fodder. 
---
Screws can be bought from vendors in bulk
---
True, but it’s like fixing a flat tire before dealing with the engine being on fire. 
---
No, they're just radioactive.
---
Part of the recipe. 
---
Thanks for checking, via another source I think its scrapping combat armour that gives you these paint options for the helmet. I have it sorted now at least!
---
With Cola Nut they're fantastic for AP and HP.
---
Because +300% was too harsh.   They needed to do this to reset it back to what should have been in the beginning all along.
---
God damnit, don't publish items from glitches and exploits, even though you didn't do them, but had the item.
---
I meant regular armor not PA 
---
no offesne but if u have probem with mats to make amo ur a low player. and this is why ur opinion is irrevelant.
---
1.  kill robots at watogat 10min need to get 90 lead and steel
---
2.  get all barbell, tincan in flatwood gym hop server 200 lead in 10mins
---
3.  build ur camp at lead source u will get \~10lead/min
---
Excuse me, wtf is wrong with Cola Nut
---
This means that Fallout 4 is not breaking because of mods, because 76 is running on the same engine, isn't modded, still has game breaking glitches. It's a weak unrepaired engine of 20 years, that hasn't seen maintenance for 16 years!! This is also the reason why hackers and dupers easily could decode the games algorithms, codes and scripts. Bethesda may have experience with epic story telling. But the games performance is just super bad, and this has never changed! 
---
It's not really on the same server or world at all. Imagine them hosting a server that is **just** two strongholds and there is an all out 50v50 brawl. You can enter this sever by "entering" the area in game somewhere on the map. This is what I mean by "instanced."
---
I often find myself dressing like a raider and wishing i had places to destroy and resources to control. Focusing our raiding would probably get more people to play that way. Forcing us to pick a faction could spur on some of that lore based reasons to kill each other lol 
---
Interesting. I guess the attack is treated as a physically thrown projectile instead of a spell?
---
If it’s a glitch I’d prefer that they look into it and fix it wouldn’t you?
---
Should of check your recent players and joined back into the server
---
And that could effect my PA? I do have an extra reg chest piece just in case my equipped one breaks
---
I just don’t think player hubs would work like they would on an MMO server with hundreds or thousands of people... theres only a couple dozen people at any time and most of them are doing quests or their own thing, and not everyone will be at one location at one time. The most Ive seen is maybe half a dozen  people at Flatwoods or Whitesprings. 
---
Aw man why didn't I think of that ffs..
---
There's millions of TSE already out there. That does nothing.
---
Explosive being nerfed will drop it more in line with the other modifiers. And +33% VATS chance is very nice for my VATS build allowing me to target weak points from a further distance. 
---
Thank you.  Happy treasure hunting.
---
Yeah, I get that. I'm not saying he didn't say those things.  That certainly isn't "everything Todd Howard said about PvP pre-launch" though. 
---
He ALSO said that players would not be forced into it.  Having no way stop somebody that's attacking you,  or to stop people from destroying your camp IS being forced into it. 
---
As far as I can tell,  quite a few people thought that that's what pacifist mode was for. You still see the occasional post from a player that didn't realize they could still be shot while in pacifist mode. 
---
same. i just farming 3 star legendary mobs to get any tse about a month ago. i got two, two shot gatling and a gaus gun. the rest legendary weapon just a junk. probaly they removed the drop of tse silently long ago... and now they nerf to useless level teh two shot weapons too. i really dont know why im punish mayself with this game.
---
I like this idea. Maybe add in different challenges to learn each legendary effect too. Bloodied could be kill X legendary enemies while at low health, Explosive could be kill X legendary enemies with explosives, etc.
---
Been defending this game since launch. If this goes out, I'm not coming back. Fucking crybaby assholes. "Waaaaah, twoshot explosive guns killed me instantly... nerf nerf nerf nerfffff!"
---
Feels bad for you man.. 
---
Another advices:   
---
\- set the beds to usable so players can rest 
---
\- weapons not allowed in the HUB. You can carry them but you can't blading them  
---
It will still be way better, nothing comes close to adding +25% +aoe.
---
Anti armor + explosive will still be op
---
Bloodied + explosive will still be op
---
Furious + explosive will still be op
---
Two shot + explosive will still be op
---
Twitch, no one streams it. Social Menu, players who you played around 50 are all greyd out. Level 100 aint high, people should hit around 500 already if not more. Most player around server are below 50. Randomly joining server and starting take over workshop, you notice that the workshop you are about to attack is same level 65 guy who you attack last night.
---
I have to disagree. Seeing as Bethesda said they want this game to last a long time a lot of things that people want are completely reasonable. Besides the people that joke about scrapping the game and starting over there’s not much that they can’t do. Also about the player hub and new start I’ve not seen anything about a brand new start but you can’t exclaim that no game has ever done just because you have never seen it. I’ve played a game that made a completely new area for starting off and made the old starting area end game content. You may have no problems with the game but a lot of people do and if you want this game to be played years down the road then the player base that is here should not be told to just sit down, shut up and wait.
---
i think you're overreacting a bit, TSE *needed* a nerf, however regular ballistic weapons also need a serious buff... TSE weapons were just about the only way to make most guns a viable alternative to melee weapons because they otherwise just sucked so much, especially pistols and most rifles and ALL energy weapons... so while i definitely feel TSE weapons needed the nerf, i don't think it should have been implemented until they had a proper plan laid out to bring non-TSE ballistic weapons up to par with melee weapons, and make energy weapons not a complete joke
---
There is the issue, she is not meant to be soloable.  If she can still be soloed, then she needs to be buffed more.
---
Even the quest indicates this (8+ players).
---
I agree there should be a way for non murder wanted statuses to pay off their crime. Its easy to become wanted especially now with the new update. Even opening a supply drop can cause wanted status. I was lucky i had dropped most of my junk before i got one shot killed. I have no urge to pvp and try not to do anything to cause pvp or wanted statuses. I prefer pve and community gaming. But with the newest update you need to be very careful to avoid wanted. I didnt play for 3 or 4 days after getting the wanted status because it was a shock. Its not what i play for. I know others that love pvp but its not me play style.
---
i dressed as a priest once and converted low level people to the church of atom with daisycutter lol. i was yelling repent sinners and atom is watching you hahaha. then when i dropped them i would take there junk and in its place leave a bag with a burnt book. 
---
i too hope they bring factions or some kind of free for all pvp arena would be a good addition. i havent played yet this year. theres only so many times on can kill the Sbq before its no fun. i (like most) have the attention span of a fish when it comes to games and sbq aint cutting it no more.
---
maybe ill try some trap builds. 
---
While I don't agree about the "f-ing ID10T" part of the comment, the rest of this I agree 100%
---
TSE trivalized content, allowed players to lay waste to camps in mere seconds. Allowed mowing down everything at Whitesprings without any consideration to others present, some people had little ability to get drops if the TSE wielder could 1 shot everything before another could take 1 shot to tag it.
---
Now the SBQ will actually be a challenge again!   Those scorched mods, prime receivers and ultracite weapons may indeed have a use.
---
There was never any proof of this happening that didn't involve the player "dropping" instead of "deploying" the PA.
---
the worst part is that if you move at all within the 30 secs to two mins it takes to load properly, you’ll freeze and most likely crash to desktop. had a great time at a whitespring nuke yesterday, crashed literally non stop every 1-3 mins.
---
You know what I think we need? Some special paintjobs for certain armours, weapons and clothing, which can only be rewarded from event quests.
---
For example, you could make it so completing all BoS events reward the player with a bunch of paintjobs for the gear they'd use, or you could make them random drop to give some incentive to re-run event quests for a faction. 
---
True!
---
Lucky for me that I was a massive hoarder, I put every outfit I found into my stash and once in a while sold the dupes. Then I slowly started learning what I already had in my stash and stopped picking up every single piece of clothing I found
---
OP TSE was a huge issue.
---
Wow I wish I had been that smart lol
---
the two shot weapons just fine. but when a tsE shootgun make more damage than a two shot mininuke somenthing wrong..
---
just remove explosive pert from teh game.
---
the way they went about this is indeed very poorly planned and shitty, but i feel like we should recognize and accept that TSE weapons *needed* the nerf, they were just too powerful, however regular ballistic and energy weapons also need a serious buff, so it's just a shame they decided to nerf the only source of viable gun builds and not buff any of the alternatives
---
btw TSE even after the nerf is a million light year from being the worst. 
---
I can usually move around just fine but if I try to bring up my pipboy it’s game over. 
---
Never this dramatically.
---
"smart"
---
I bet you were capable of actually fast travelling at some point in the latest 150 hours of play time
---
&gt;I think the the primary issue with TS is that it also multiplies all other bonuses, so anything that's overpowered is twice as overpowered with two shot.
---
Quoting from Aetrion, the TS that multiplies all other bonuses \*is\* a huge issue as well.
---
Now we all know what will be on the next patch. 
---
just like a nuke area. have some kind of mission to launch a nuke zone sized area of halucigen gas nuke or something like it and then its a pvp free for all
---
LMAO, you certainly miss less of the game when you can't fast-travel
---
7 out of 10 times I managed to kill the lvl +100 player when I was below lvl 45. I used nuka grenades at the workshop claim area for high DMG. Later on I was succesfull with nuke mines but everytime I also killed myself with those lol. Or another tactic, especially against wanted players who are at a severe disadvantage not seeing you on the map I sneeked up close to them, take my first shot with a black powder weapon and then quickly switch to the handmade to finish the job. Most of the times when I failed to kill the player I did manage to run away screaming and survive. And I always use psychobuff for these encounters.
---
The advantage of engaging in pvp at a lower lvl is you don't lose many caps when you die. Just make sure to stash that junk before you engage.
---
Thanks man.
---
Literally hundreds
---
How about some bad guy? Super mutant? Scorched?
---
Yes and about time!  
---
TSE still add 50% damage boost in total to the weapon, so still pretty good.
---
100% agree
---
Well damn. I stand corrected, blind, and late. 
---
PvE and PvP servers would have been the best solution! Everyone would enjoy what they like without nerfs and make-ups
---
I understand it could seem like grief but I feel like it would also help others feel more like they are in a particular faction. Like me as a raider. Raiders attack people’s homes and and take them for all they have. I enjoy pvp but I also feel like their should be more immersion to the faction side of things. And that “griefing” would be more of a fear towards a gang of raiders attacking you. 
---
Doing what you’re asking takes less than 30 seconds right now. I could probably do it in ten. You already have what you want, switching perks on the fly, don’t complicate things forcing a buggy new menu. They couldn’t even add bigger totals to Caps in barter without intended side effects. 
---
Both Forward Station delta and drop site V9 are good areas to spare and still activate the event. It's not even an issue of rads for me, but just knowing people generally crash more when they're not having to deal with the environmental effects and animations associated with a nuke zone
---
Thing is the scaling of SB Queen is fucked. They never buffed the Queen, it's been nerfed heavily at one point. But somehow the higher level you get and the better weapons you get, the harder she becomes. It kinda makes sense that she cannot be killed in 30 seconds with good TSEs, but the Queen is the only mob that takes more than a couple bullets to die. But then it discourages to get higher level and better weapons at the same time. So good weapons are not really needed anywhere.
---
About Heavy Gun being the only viable build for queen, I'd agree with that. It pretty much is. That is if you want to make sure she dies every time with random people. Sure you can kill her with any weapon class, but you need a lot more people to do so safely. Maybe even organized groups are required. This view is based on my own experience with the Queen. Countless of times I have had to give up on Queen if I used non-Heavy Gunner build. +10 x 3 Perks is not enough. Unless you have more high lvl players with TSEs, you must have +60 dmg Perks, Bloody Mess, One Gun Army and Stabilized. So that you can kill Queen, even if there were 5 low level players jerking off in a bunker after hitting her once.
---
Whats the deal with TS nerf? Those are fine. No, let me rephrase that: those are what makes endgame bearable. Nerf explosive, leave ts alone. And since we are on a nerf crusade now maybe you guys should take a look at bloodied weapons and unyelding (+sentinel) armor too? Hmm?
---
Love these! Just wish my wife played PC and not consoles! lol
---
Additionally, while bleed itself isn't going to go murdering people, from my experience it has its use against people built to counter Melee damage. 
---
As far as I know, there is no bleed resistance stat so the damage can't be mitigated. This means while bleed doesn't do a lot, it's not hindered by damage reduction effects and perks and even the slap damage reduction from attacking a passive player. I've had someone think I was hacking because I was slapping them with the gauntlet. The attacks barely did anything, but the bleed damage was persistently eating away at them.
---
One guy I fought was barely taking damage from my Deathclaw gauntlet. He in turn was barely damaging me. I swapped to my Mole Miners gauntlet and let the bleed steadily work it's magic. 
---
I use the lever for what your using the Gauss for so I'd recommend the Radium just because of the fire rate and clip size.
---
How high leveled do you think players are who play a couple hours 3-4 days a week (a generous estimate for a "normal" player) and never grind WS? I've played quite a bit more than that, don't grind WS and am around lv70 with a single character.
---
Was thinking same, but even with 75% damage bonus from TSE, is there anything better? For high firerate and big ammo capacity weapons, Furious becomes main as it already was close to TS damage. For PVP and PVE (questing) snipers/rifles instigating becomes main. For everything else? Doesn't seem much of a pick, Antiarmor? Many of the effect were useless from the first place- mutant slayer, exterminator etc. No point taking assassins, that does 10% to players, when you can pick two shot that does 25%. Same goes for Mutants. Junkies another pointless. Berserkers, only good when you use hazma. Executioners one potential, but that triggers at 50% and does 50% more, aint that basically 25% boost. Medic, pointless, no one is short on stims and there really aint need of it. 
---
Truth, but hurt their feeling
---
Maybe we start in another vault and become a ghoul! Or super mutant! Would love to see different races in 76.
---
Nice one! This took some time. Cheers bro.
---
Sounds more like mercenary work than raider. if you're going for that raider rp then just do it of your own volition.
---
Someone got out of their X01 power armor next to the shack at fissure prime to use the workbench. I walked right up to the armor and couldn't even interact with it,  so you can't steal armor unless it's purposefully dropped. 
---
Agree. Lever action isn't a "messy time" gun. 
---
Even on PvE I see the problem with people having an outrageous amount of damage per shot especially when every one is trying to get a hit on that legendary 3 star lvl 40 mole miner.  Instead they should make it if your in the event or area of the kill you get the loot while if you deal damage you get loot plus exp. I’m not going to lie I’ve murdered people in cold blood who one shot a 3 star legendary and then I follow them wreaking havoc until they block me. I’m salty don’t cheat me out of my legendaries with your broken weapons save that stuff for when your solo use normal weapons for every one to get a hit. Hopefully they fix this system it’s frustrating.
---
Wrong. It's not fun to be 1 shot by anything. The answer isn't to make more 1 shot combinations.
---
I'm glad someone said it.
---
The games boring and easy as is, has been after the first week.
---
I dont understand why people would want it to be easier??
---
You might actually be onto something...
---
I dont play the game where i keep going from point A to B seeking legendary weapons,  i have a 2 shot gatling just because i killed a legendary protrectron at watoga. And it was just luck i guess. I was searching for junkscrap for repairing and crafter PA pieces. But during my exploring i killed so many enemies so with my normal gatling gun  and i used that so much that i should be legendary at some point..  I dont see the fun in hunting for weapons anyways.  Besides most legendaries give loot i dont need  
---
Your BF is one lucky sob.
---
Ok cool, because ever since I saw even a hint, I was too paranoid to craft my X-01 pieces around any players and I thought they stuck around to try to steal it
---
Id say thats a reasonable observation, not a judgement. The man clearly has an addiction to the game if he has put in 12 hours a day every day since release, those are numbers that could potentially kill a person.
---
&gt;2521 Damage     
---
Is that listed damage in the weapon tab when on your pip boy? or is that a value youve calculated taking into account sneak attack and crit bonus multipliers? 
---
Wait. You can eat people after you kill them in pvp? When they are in the call for help stance?
---
Well I’m also seeing it from the side of things where we’ve seen in past games that raiders will raiders will do things if they’re paid to do them, I can’t name an example off the top my head but I’m sure I’ve seen such a thing in New Vegas or Fallout 4 
---
The black or olive colored one is labelled as officer suit
---
Haha nice maybe I should do a explosives build

Is this any help?

Just send them a support ticket. The hell would you post in apublic forum apart to get internet points?

I thought Top of the World would make a good player hub.
---
[Yeah.](https://youtu.be/btmPkBYRPT0?t=14)
---
I can tell you’ve never launched a nuke. So how about you don’t have an opinion on this until you have
---
Of course, but they have Feedback section under Support, which is meant for glitch report, without distributing any unintended game items and content info publicly. If you choose Reddit, 99,99% of the readers are not working for Bethesda.
---
Rifles in general are not much good when you get overrun by bloated ghouls are they? I do a lot of walking backwards and eating stims in these situations. Gets old real fast :-)
---
Same here. I have a two shot 10mm sub machinegun and it doesn't even break 70 in damage. My 2 shot dbl shotty does just into the 300s with 8 stars in shotgunner. 2 shot is not the issue. If they do nerf that I might ditch the 10mm as 1.25x damage is pretty useless without all my perks in guerrilla. Even with the shotgun, I gave a guy I thought wanted me to kill him to rid a bounty a dbl blast to the head point blank while in PW and it hardly had any effect. The plasma grenade that dropped when he killed me instead did more damage than the gun even with a measly 1 star in explosives. 
---
If I can't sell ammo, then let me break it down. This could include almost spent fusion cores.

On a much lesser note if you own the music rights for songs you own from 3 &amp; 4 could you extended the station to include them? It could make it alot less repetitive.

on the table where? I am also currently looking for tape 1, i am a pc player
---
Agreed, the situation will be compounded when they've nerfed TSE as well. 
---
I disagree, having different servers makes no difference when the issue is the damage being taken in pvp.
---
Personally i like one shot kills boths recieving and giving. Thats me and each to their own.
---
However Im certain that the majority fall into the category where they dont like that.
---
Save your indignation for a subject that matters. Video games do not matter. 
---
I want to shoot down a nuke. It's that simple. 
---
Theyre coming. Cant remember where I saw it.
---
Ok, you’ll have to do the same amount of fighting through hordes of robots simoutaniously doing necessary tasks to shoot down an ICBM that goes into orbit....with a missile launcher. Congratulations go educate yourself
---
I've been able to fight the Grafton monster maybe 5 times but protest March is always active.
---
And yes they do appear lower in only two spots I believe but I could be wrong
---
I think that youre concentrating too much on the tse then the why. I am using the tse as an example since that is current.  since  The whole point here is rooted in dupping. Soooooooo many people went to the forums and twitter complaining about getting 1 shot by people using tse while not being in pvp. Something  I could not duplicate doing things legit. So I feel the result was nerfing tse down to "fix" it. Now if the gun was nerfed for a totally different series of reasons then whatever its the way of the game have at it. If not and it was a respond to all the cries of people whom are being griefed then it's not the gun solely and mostly the misused stat items that have been duped. Stacking by an error in game code and having the effect virtually last forever by use of another game bug ( not sure if the recent patch fixed it as I seen no notes addressing it.)  plus all the duped stuff needs to go for the game economy to stable out for fair and fun trader roles to work for player trading to be successful.
---
&gt; I have over 850 hours on the game 
---
I paused reading this. I think it is safe to say a lot of people paused reading this.   
---
Based on your comment history you are a PS4 player, so I am going to assume that you played the entire 31 hours of B.E.T.A. offered prior to the November 14, 2018 release.  
---
That being said we will assume you have played 820 hours of game play since the release date. I am rounding to a nice number because you state 'over 850' and I like the neatness of 820 over 819 once we take the B.E.T.A. into consideration.  
---
At the time, it has been 65 days since the release of Fallout 76 or 1560 hours.  
---
In order to have played the number of hours you purport, you would have played **12.6 hours every day since November 14**. Assuming you spend the [average 8.8 hours daily sleeping](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.t12.htm#tus_tu_nr12.f.2) (this includes naps and periods of sleeplessness as stated on the linked page's footnotes), this leaves **2.6 hours every day for everything else**.

You mean the old Fallout Pip Boy UI from Fallout.... as in Fallout 1??? It's Been the Pipboy  this entire time.  FO 1, 2, and 76 are on the Pipboy 2000.  Fallout 3, New Vegas and 4 were on the Pipboy 3000.
---
The tabs kind of been moved around a bit from 1 and 2 to 3, New Vegas, 4 and 76 but it practically the same since the beginning of the franchise. 
---
I really want people to visit, if I see people near my house on the map I will usually try and guide them there. I keep locks on everything though as sometimes I'll be hunted down for a 10 cap bounty. I'd rather have some form of defence, although they generally just 1 shot me with a TSE through the window anyway, also 1 shotting my pet
---
Every day.  Drive me NUTS.
---
I don't think it's proximity. I'm a witch that lives in a desolate swamp. There's no nearby markers, so I never see anyone. Yet... i always come home to scorched and ghouls punching my digs, or tons of wreckage. No manners! 
---
Hey thanks for the tip... Red Rocket was one of my favourite FO4 bases. Here's hoping the high school uses aluminium dinner trays.
---
5k 
---
Im fairly certain each has 3 random tunes. Seems to be corresponding to the day.
---
Constantly.. Give it 30 secs or something before you try do anything it helps 
---
I don't use turrets because they take up my budget. I always have extra mats, so I just repair the broken stuff.
---
So anti armor legendary + perf mags + tank killer = 100% penetration!
---
Y is being used for trades. X would be better because all it does is put your weapon away when the other guy moves.
---
But I totally agree with you. 
---
Always check suitcases and lunch boxes at train station + ice containers at the entrance of the golf club in Whitespring, found some plans yesterday !
---
It's the world loading in. Even more of an issue if it is loading in yours or others' camps. 
---
I tend to give it a good 10-15 seconds before even moving my character.
---
Think of it like warming up an old car before you pull off :) Yeah it's a banger, but it still drives.
---
Yeh im not sure how they would fix this considering this is like the 99999999 post about it.
---
Hmm, I don't think I've seen a legendary acorched, but I trust you and will try this!
---
Yup oddly enough I does.  
---
F no 😂
---
TSE not terrible for the game btw
---
\&gt;shoot in general direction you think they may be
---
\&gt;1 shots them
---
Oh yeah, giving players a sense of identity in the game would probably spur play styles big time. Giving me some motivation would be nice. Like options or perks on certain factions get. Like the ability to pass out aid items for responders or energy boost to brotherhood. Maybe 10 percent more scrap looted from other players for raiders. You'd need to be able to identify them from their icon or something.
---
Lets make a pilgrimage to Diamond City, I wanna ser what that looks like now.
---
how about the screenshot of the hours played?
---
Thank you Kanye, very cool ! 
---
Nah, will definitely try this out thanks for sharing it with us 
---
I have cannibal on my PvP set up purely to eat them. I'm sure the level 6 enjoyed it.
---
Yeah, but I feel like you’re not really a raider till you raiding, destroying everything and everyone type thing. 
---
You honestly might be able to build at any of them because I don't think they're fast travelable locations. I'll have to check that out. 
---
Start fresh entirely and wipe every month would be cool.
---
They will still be the best affixes by far and likely still 1 shot in pvp
---
i *definitely* am. Doing that math, the OP has spent less than 3 hours a day doing anything other than sleeping or playing Fallout. I am deeply concerned and hopeful he is just a liar.
---
I am sure his parents are in agreement with this thought.
---
Then you ain’t getting one buddy boy 
---
Lol pretty much in my defense tho I’m lvl 190 he was lvl 31 soooooo can’t imagine he had anything going for him other than his charmeleon mutation/armor. And I did hit him pretty much dead on luckily his baggy was right where I shot. Probly would have killed him by just jumpin in the air and carpet bombing the area too tho lol 
---
While I feel for you, 2 hours is a bit much. I'll give people 30 mins to get it done before I go in to give them a hand. If they're not at the last part I'll do it myself. 
---
But can I go back to my room and get my stuff... Or is it your stuff? 
---
Yea, u want it for my rifle build and make a pipe revolver rifle, 45bullets in my ❤
---
Yeah I’ve seen that completely stupid nerf they’re gonna do. I’m still hoping they will nerf the explosive instead as soon as they get the shitstorm from the players. 
---
You wont see him, becouse after people started telling others about those spawn, they are all dead...
---
Which is why I think they're perfect for PVP servers. Getting shot is no longer an accident. You shoot me I know what you're up to. 
---
With the how hard it is to tell what someone is doing when they slap u it'll be nice to be able to just react to a threat and not think about. Will also allow for hostile "raids" instead if hoping they shoot back. 
---
I don't think it was removed, I had it yesterday?
---
I have 3000 caps, it's all I have, if your still selling the mod I will take it, help a brother out, I've served hopped for 2 hours trying to find it! My xbox gamer tag is siv1987 if u decide u want them, I'd be willing to sweeten the deal with any junk/add u desire that I may have 
---
The overseer, unhappy with the progress being made about the Silos/Wasteland decides it's best to blow the door from the vault, making it open to any and everyone willing to help. This can make it so later newer players can still spawn in the vault as either a new dweller or someone that came from the Wastes. Could also make it that the overseer only has the ability to blow a vaults door via command and DNA that way the loop hole of "why don't we just blow open the other vaults then?" Is covered. 
---
From a 2shot lover:
---
Sigh, two shot *is* unbalanced. There is no other legendary mod that gives you a full 100% damage bonus regardless of health. The mods that even come close, executioners and instigating have requirements before they start dealing their damage. 
---
That said, explosive is unbalanced too, when paired with the 100% dmg increase. If they are going to nerf one 100% increase, they might as well make explosive rounds not benefit from the demolition perk. 
---
Dear god dont do monthly wipes
---
Wasn't being mean. I'm just getting a bit salty at FO76 subreddit today. Everyone crying about the nerf and mass downvoting people who like it. It's very needed and necessary imo. 
---
Sentinel only works when not moving. I don't know if I fought anyone having that yet, but I imagine you should either kill them when they're moving or take shots at range while hidden from them until their armor breaks. You sure it's possible to be an unkillable god?
---
The very next vendor I go too, I have just found T-45 Calibrated Shocks too. There must be something to this. 
---
No one ain't buying one for that price buddy boy
---
Erm, one question. What is a "Cheat-Mod"? Is this elaborated somewhere?
---
This is also true :(
---
Yes, this one
---
I have Plasma Gatling and found the ammo for it was incredibly easy and plentiful...  Plus seemed to find way too many plasma cores.   After I crafted 10 in the beginning, i never had to make anymore, ever.  I think I used it for 20+ levels.  Of course it broke  many times and thus limited the use of it.
---
I just want to see the pipe rifle, vault jumpsuit war out in flatwoods.
---
The 'intelligent raiders' were keeping this quiet.
---
I did run into an issue during play tonight where I scrapped some generators from my CAMP to build better generators now that I have the blueprints… but the cost wasn’t refunded to my budget. :-/
---
It's kinda weird but my camp is right outside of the whitesprings golf course entrance next to the bunker main entrance and no one ever takss that or goes past it. 
---
Or when you just get a spinning circle and her body disappears before you can loot her
---
I am sure his mother is thrilled.
---
Considering the low player population per server, this would be pointless. Most players would be exploring/questing, at a workshop, afk, working on their base, .. Which results in you seeing perhaps only 1 or 2 other players at this hub.   
---
This would be a great feature if we'd have 100+ players per server, but we don't.
---
Camp McClintock complete with the soldiers and all. Preferably before the robots took over as it was recently before the bombs.
---
You insist on thinking that because launching a nuke is a chore that I haven't done it or that the effort should shield you from the actions of other players. I assure you, that would make shooting it down all the more satisfying.
---
I would like to see either easy (No pvp), Normal (current), Hard (their upcoming pvp), and Survival (perma-death/higher penalty than junk loss) servers, OR making it so that player vending gives you the option to make your CAMP indestructible. 
---
Yeah except I feel like they will have a system in place where camp items don’t take damage, because of everyone is hostile towards each other there would be no consequence to destroying each other’s base. At least if it works how a normal server does now where you don’t get a bounty if you’re already hostile towards that player  
---
i know of maybe 10 players that got banned today on ps4 the ban hammer is comming and its great
---
I'm level ~200 and started doing events for atom challenges (need to do ~400 events for them). I think they give pretty nice stuff, solid exp, some rare items, caps back, meet people, get water while at it etc. I pretty much got all I need in game but events are nice filler untill new content comes.
---
Granted there are sucky events and good events. I didn't bother much with events early mid game because they weren't that good at the time.
---
I am probably going to shamelessly steal that lol. 
---
I find harpers ferry carries t-60 and excavator after some server hopping.
---
lol. They knee cap TSEs before Sentinel Assassin which makes TSEs hit you like a wet paper towel. I think a brain dead hamster knows what the problem is better at this point. 
---
Hemlock holes lol. Wish it at least had a more recognizable layout. Like a b rate whitesprings
---
Same for Charleston. If it we're just less blown up I'd have a better feel for the place. 
---
For actual prewar looks the top of the world would look awesome all cleaned up. Nice signage and slopes would be cool to see all snowy and being used. Plus some of the extra buildings would probably be used which would be cool. 
---
Same with the mega stop cause all the old timey advertisements and color schedule would look great ( the galleria too! )
---
What level are you? I’m just trying to determine if there’s a level when they start showing up more frequently 
---
Would be cool. Would be nice to get more insight into that last batch of humans the holotape mentions 
---
With you here for sure.... They should go look at ESO... After all has there name on it... Could be as powerful as possible in pve to get good gear from ever spawning mobs to then go use that gear in PvP with nerfs to op stuff constantly keeping the PvP zone (cyrodil) even and fair matched 
---
Honestly. Getting ready to go to Basic myself, and hearing that speech and then the Governor shutting the DI down like that was just depressing as hell.
---
Fuck Robots!
---
Every one
---
It’s hard work in order to launch it, and that benefits the entire server by giving them a high level loot zone.
---
Either way you can’t shoot a missile that goes through the atmosphere with a sam launcher, that’s stupid and makes 0 sense. If you want to change the game then you need to actually think of a pheaseable way of doing it. 
---
Do some actual research and launch a nuke yourself, see if you would want it shot down, until then you don’t have an opinion on that. So shut up, do some research, and launch one.
---
Can use all at once if you please
---
Maybe make them harder to damage or disallow small camps in favor of strongholds or areas meant to corral players and let them build collaboratively 
---
Now all I can eat is fruits and veggies. =(

I would love a more expensive version that would let us grow things we normally can't plant. Let me grow some aster, thistle, silt beans, ginseng, and pumpkins damn it.
---
im just glad there are good people here to do atoms work. 
---
All but either carnivore or herbivore cos they be mutually exclusive
---
Because player vending isn’t a thing yet. Once traffic=caps becomes a thing, high traffic areas like Whitesprings will become prime real estate. 
---
Perhaps we could just have a portioned off area with small rectangular build areas for a special vending camp at the high traffic areas that you can rent/claim once you get onto a server.  Have them all be identical so that placing your little vendor stand is convenient.  
---
You can’t shoot down an ICBM with a missile launcher, you don’t have

A) the fuel capacity
---
B) the lock-on range

C) the payload

D)a way of rebuilding the missile once fired
---
Vault dwellers taste the best!
---
Go on their Twitter. You don't need an account to see it if you don't have one.
---
I'm surprised there isn't a bigger base unless I'm mistaken. so many operating bases and little camps but not much of a prewar base. Brotherhood had the asylum. 
---
Shh sweetie, the only thing your going to get is lootboxes.
---
Do you do anything else ? Wow. 
---
Thank you for this much needed post on the subreddit. I didnt think it was clear enough where people stood on this nerf.
---
The many other posts stating basically the exact same thing most certainly did not inform anyone.
---
I agree a change was needed but. In my opinion just nerfing damage was a bad move it was the easy quick fix to shut up the people complain about being one shot. But in reality it’s just the explosive effect and how the explosive perk card effects it instead of only affecting grenades and actual real explosive weapons it’s double dipping. And even with the nerfs one shotting in pvp will still happen I deal 950 damage with a bloodied ski sword and that’s the only effect so is that too strong too? My point is the pvp damage scaling is what needed fixed make all pvp damhenreduced by like 60 and remove the explosive perk card and problem solved. I use my TSE shotgun without the explosive card equipped and it feels fine strong like a shotgun should be at close range and doesn’t kill at a distance and normally requires two shots unless it’s super close add the explosive card and my damage goes crazy it’s the perk and how it affects the 2shot effect not the actually base damage of the mod 
---
thanks!
---
Dude, do you check news? There will be TSE nerf, new meta Golf club is not capable of killing queen in few minutes.
---
I’m thinking if you damage a camp piece outside of combat there should still be a bounty mechanic to discourage you’re base being destroyed while you’re away 
---
White springs gets a giant glowing one... Dried out lake spawns some kind of rad fish/worm thing... 
---
Behemoth boss!! 
---
Even damn transformer type thing for watoga like give us something else to do 😂 end game can take 2 days to reach with enough effort then there's nothing left but grind shit that gets super tedious 
---
Tse isn't the issue its the bobblehead stacking 😂 these guys couldn't run a pissup in a brewrey 😂
---
They make it worse never better 😂
---
I am 100, I haven't felt level determines inventory, it just requires a lot of server hoping. Harpers ferry is the best its spawn point is close. More often than not, it has at least one power armor mod.
---
Just go to the [real one. ](http://www.camdenpark.com) 
---
The version in the game gave me a bit of nostalgia. Apart from the clown being replaced by a cat, the sign out front is quite similar. Note the rollercoaster there is an older wood production?  It’s modeled after the “Big Dipper”. 
---
Thanks a lot man!

Game is LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE. Seriously. ran into a bug where I load into a black screen. No screen visible. I can walk around, fire a gun, pull up my pipboy. But cannot see anything in game. I can see my map fine, fast travel, see perks. 
---
I would like us to stay as human when we begin. To me starting as a human just like everyone else is great BUT have that changable. Exposing yourself to too much radiation with out healing will start to turn you into a ghoul, each level of "ghoulness" will determine stats and buffs until you eventually reach feral. Or expose yourself to the FEV and become a super mutant, the more you take determines your "super mutantness". I think it would be better that way as we all start the same, but don't end the same. Just my thought 
---
Ive got 2-3k 5mm on xb1
---
He told her to gobble him raw, and the lady obliged him. Seems legit.
---
Honestly, I thought that this was a given. Without a character re-roll pvp servers will not be playable. I certainly wouldn't even try the pvp mode unless it forced a character reroll as it'll just be TSE weapons or people with top power armour/armour/already complete builds.   
---
In relation to this however, it should have a delay on logging out like WoW does. So people can't just see someone approaching or attacking and instantly log out. WoW uses 10 seconds and forces you to sit still during those 10 seconds as if you try to be scummy and do it midfight you'll die obviously.
---
Have they not gone lower in your inventory to loose screws seen as you used some? 
---
They probably already moved on to Starfield development, and F76 is being handled by a small team. How else can they justify not only the lack of quick response towards certain prevalent issues, but also the release of new content? 
---
If this game wants to survive it needs rapidly to find balance between solving issues and giving players new stuff to do.
---
i built a mire base just below the treetop and went weeks without noticing it lol
---
Yo can stack them all, herbivore is better than carnivore imo because corn soup is the best food in the game, easy to farm and easy to make and replenishes both food and water 
---
and one free pet Goddammit!!!
---
&gt;If that's the case, than I personally will give up on a game I had such high hopes for.    
---
    
---
Exactly why they shouldn't be listening to you casual kids, you get your way and cry anyways. Nobody cares if you're going to leave the game, just do it instead of creating these bandwagons on terrible ideas. TSE gave you a godly end goal to achieve, but look what happens when you all complain about shit you don't understand. I don't know if you've noticed by now, but their changes only go one way. Enjoy the game the way it is or leave, thanks.
---
Simple. Instead of simply damaging a piece causing a bounty, don’t cause the wanted status to happen until something is destroyed. Buff camp item health to prevent one-shot destruction of a wall or something else placed outside. 
---
And I’d also like to see the bounty set according to the cost of repair, not simply x caps per item. Destroy a wall?  Big deal. Ooh. Gonna cost a couple pieces of wood. Destroy a Decon arch?  Screw you. 100 caps. 
---
Yeah. Went to the Naval Signal Station for the Enclave today, wasn't very "Military", but I'm glad they actually put the thought in to think of it as a Navy installation. It's the little detail so.
---
people are killing 10 to 15 SBQ a week at this point... 
---
There are 19 mutations and i have 18 mutations active. I choose Carnivore instead of Herbivore because glowy mobs from nuke zones drop meat that never spoils called Ionized Meat. It gives 40 food and only weighs 0.05 lbs.
---
I think the issue is that fat man and missle launcher is too poor damage..  Fat man should hv over 2500 damage against enemies and missles over 1000, because those weapons is "heavy explosive" and if you bring 39 weight for missle launcher it must be more usefully.
---
They must also increase .50 caliber damage and 308 light machine gun. Too ridiculous damage for this beautiful weapons.
---
I don’t even know what it would take to repair my arch, but yeah the cost for destruction is way unbalanced you can basically ruin someone’s entire base for 500 caps and that’s not right. 
---
Eh I sold mine. It’s all about punching things. And I don’t like the sound effect for the rocket hammers. 
---
Bu..but.. Bethesdaaa! You were supposed to nerf the guns I don't use *sniffle* not the ones I liked! Make the game easy and make me a god, please daddy Todd Howard? 
---
This feature is not limited to 1 Hub76 per world server. It would act like it's own server.
---
 So since it would not have to build an entire world maybe it could accommodate 50 players or even more.  Then any player that enters Hub 76 would zone into the Hub 76v1 zone which can take X number of players after that it creates another server (Hub76v2) and starts to fill that one. While replacing any vacancies in Hub 76v1. And so forth. This way the game tries to keep the Hub filled. The question would be how many players could a hub have on without causing server instability or excessive lag.
---
It just seems so unlikely that I get nothing for so many hours of playing the game and server hopping, now within 24 hours I have 4 different calibrated shocks that I have never seen before. 
---
Explosive will still be good but TS will be rather bad compared to bloodied, furious and armor pen(and berserker for naked/hazmat guys)
---
Download the elder scrolls legends, go to the friend list and accept/send the friend request
---
Ive done it for even less than that (griefer at the golf club).  Total destruction.  Cost:  one orbital, two mini-nukes, and 330 caps. 
---
Someone nearby was pissed off too so he cleared my bounty and gave me back whatever caps he got off it and I gave him some goodies for his troubles. 
---
Sorry wrong sub, whoops!
---
A) Radiation does not linger in water for 200 plus years
---
B) Dumber shit than this has been done in Bethesda games.
---
C) I want to shoot down nukes.
---
Yep, which is why it's weird people are getting all up in arms by the Nerf. 
---
It's just went from 'Top Tier Effect that was unreasonably good' to 'Top Tier Effect'
---
Nah, combat rifle sniper for when lots pf things need to go down in a hurry.
---
Rad riflw is for pvp, lots of enemies have either high rad resist, but in pvp healing rads is a pain 
---
Don't talk to me about sense in a Bethesda Fallout game. And stop assuming that the effort of launching a nuke should make your actions impervious to the actions of other players.
---
Why are you absolutely nullifying the Two Shot and Explosive effects instead of just nerfing their PvP damage when they are both used at the same time? Nobody is particularly bothered about how good TSE weapons are in PvE combat (as they make fighting endgame bullet sponges much easier).
---
I don't even own a TSE weapon, but I do own multiple non-explosive Two Shot weapons and an Explosive LMG, so all of my decent endgame weapons are now getting totally unnecessary nerfed into the ground. Either nerf their PvP damage strictly, or strictly nerf the damage these two effects used *when combined*, instead of nerfing both effects seperstely and making any weapon using Two Shot or Explosive on their own pretty much useless.
---
I think making one of the other vaults fill this function would be better. You wouldnt want brand new players potentially getting harassed by high level characters.
---
That is fantastic, I looked at the park map. Its not perfect but damn its similar. I love all the touches inside this game. 
---
people give Bethesda so much crap for the state of the game, with out even giving in credit for the little touches. the teddy bear cleaning urinals, or unclogging porta potties. jangles the moon monkey driving a truck with a horse trailer full of two fully intact Giddy up butter cup toys. the bears and skeleton circled around on a rug with a bottle in the middle. 
---
The game has its bugs, but I thank Bethesda for putting in as much time and effort as a True single player fallout, if not even more so by the fact the game and surroundings have to tell the story with environmental story telling due to the lack of npcs. And with that high bar to clear, they cleared it.
---
Well, you'd have to participate to find out what rewards they could give...
---
Yeah, i agree. I also have zero interest in pvp, shooting anyones camp or worse, getting my camp destroyed. 
---
You can't destroy buildings in the world, so why would i want to destroy someone else's camp.
---
I also find it stupid to nerf TSE guns because of pvp. Are they overpowered? Yeah. But if it would be possible to turn pvp off, it wouldn't be a problem. A lot of people don't care about it and still have to deal with all the downsides.
---
Bethesda should rather focus on fixing weapons that don't work, instead of nerfing those who do.
---
All old stuff had to be purged due to being toxic. But the robots once reactivated started cleaning and redecorating with basic stuff from storage.
---
Sorry those questionable mags you had hidden under your bed are likely gone.
---
Sugar Grove? The insignia on the wall was a nice touch. The nuke launching sites are massive compared to any other site and are pretty cool. If launching wasn't so time consuming I'd probably hang around more. I'll probably go in a slower pace run to enjoy the effort they put in
---
Power Armor has no defense against explosive damage other than the fireproof perm that can be used with any armor. Basically you won't even take half the damage vs explosives that you currently are if you had normal armor modded with Dense.
---
Yeah, I was so stoked when I found my first excavator calibrated shock, I server hopped for an hour to find my second. endless carry weight.
---
Nerf on TS makes total sense. TS is flat out double the damage, no other effect even comes to close to that. Even after nerfs TS is still viable. That alone shows how ridiculously op ts alone already is.
---
My vision is my crew being a gang of raiders that you can hire to kill and destroy anyone that you have reason to want to hate the game that day. Basically make us a weapon of revenge. 
---
Never launched one myself, I'll have to check it out sometime. Got into the basic part of the Whitesprings Bunker today, I was immediately losing my shit over the perfectly preserved US Flags.
---
Fix the game so I can play for longer than 15-20 minutes
---
Yeah I found it weird that everyone would just leave the vault and never return aside from the free fast travel.
---
I mean they're trying to survive, the vault presumably has power, heating, clean water and amenities.
---
Surely some people would want to stay behind.

I wasn't particularly impressed by the combat rifle's damage, but perhaps I was using an underleveled one. I'll put it back in the running. 
---
thx found it :)
---
But not for everyone. Playing WoW on a pvp server (classic) because of my friends made me hate that game and quit it for a year. I then decided that i'll never play on a pvp server again. 
---
For me it's doing PvE with the risk of high frustration.
---
It's the fact it's a huge, detailed fallout biome I can explore. The bugs are crazy but at least I'm playing around in the fallout world while glitching the hell out 
---
Fantastic post, you just made this stuff click for me as I had been wondering for some time. This is good info for planning camps. 
---
Ya would be awesome to be able to make your Camp Public...but they need to fix pvp and expand passive mode to include no damage to camps.
---
Otherwise griefers would just hop from camp to camp destroying them.
---
The problem isn't either of these affixes, idk why they listen to rookies on the internet who haven't the slightest clue what they're talking about. The problem is the way shotgun damage is calculated. It's basically a normal gun's damage x8 for the pellets it shoots, x16 if you're talking about 2-shot. So now you've got 16 shots and 16 bullets... Divide shotguns damage by about 6 and they should be in line with everything else. They're still going to be super powerful in TSE versions, but that's kinda the point of TSE now isn't it?
---
You can't take the sky from me.
---
Oh yeah it's super cool looking. Hopefully we get to fully explore the sectioned off areas of whitesprings soon ( cottages, weird conference halls ) 
---
Used to go a few times every year as a kid. Not the greatest park, but it was what was close and affordable for us. It was kinda like a permanent fair and had that feel about it.  
---
There’s many things in the game that mimic real life places:
---
The cranberry bog is a reference to Cranberry Glades. 
---
The big bridge is an homage to the real New River Gorge bridge (I wish they’d have put some dead parachuters below lol, esp since the war happened in October, close to Bridge Day).
---
VTU bears a striking resemblance to the oldest buildings on the campus of WVU (I can’t for the life of me recall their names). 
---
The radio satellite array you go to for Rose is a reference to Green Banks
---
The Whitesprings Resort is a reference to the Greenbrier Hotel (which also has a bunker under it). Even the name comes from the real world as it’s located in White Sulphur Springs, named for the natural sulphur springs that were thought to be therapeutic. 
---
I like it because you can stack anti armor mods with anti armor legendary effects with anti armor perks. 
---
Heavy gunner here. Yes. I have this. It's been a thing for me the entire life of the game.
---
Not downvoting you, but not a fan of posts talking on mine and other players behalf. I'm not losing hope. I'm experiencing slightly better performance after each patch so far. Disconnects, invisible workshop enemies and the occasional pvp encounter with bobblehead cheaters breaking my armor in one shot are my main complaints. And that the game is so incredibly easy, but I hope the pvp mode will change that.
---
Awesome, take a look at my new **One-and-a-quarter slightly explosive combat shotgun**! It's almost a good weapon.
---
You can actually pick the perk card separately from the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stat.  For example, you can choose +1 Strength then pick an Intelligence perk card.  On PC, it's "Z" and "C" to scroll through the different types of perks, not sure what it would be if you are on PS4 of Xbox though. 
---
Thank you so much!! I'll definitely try this when I have time!! :D
---
Ty man was cool to see and keep up the good work
---
Added!
---
These reports were false.  Though apparently there were reports of getting prompts to interact with the stand, but it doesn't do anything and errors out.
---
Or its Rosie in the human flesh. She gave up being a raider years ago and turned merchant but had to leave her robot behind. She is shocked to hear it is still in Raider mode.
---
Love to have a foul mouthed, violence loving merchant to talk to.
---
You guys complain and they wreck two shots by 75%, won't you ever learn to shut up? Every time you ask Beth for something, they put it straight up your arse and twist, just stop asking for stuff please.
---
I cant wait until im high level enough to kill you fuckers.
---
Yall went to far with murdering my Deathclaw pet last night... i swear vengeance...
---
You RAPED her... You MURDERED her... You KILLED HER CHILDREN
---
It's also a guaranteed spawn point for the black cowboy hat, up on a skull atop a pole at the upper end of the camp.
---
Melee will be nerfed next until nothing does damage anymore...
---
&gt; \[...\] and a couple of pieces of ammo \[...\]
---
...for a weapon you don't even use.
---
Same and same. Happens to all gataling plasma and laser guns.
---
I'm running multiple characters and it appears to me vendors sell plans based on two things. One is your level and secondly the plans you've already acquired. I can for certain confirm that I could only buy underarmor plans of the lowest lvl (treated lining I think) at first and as soon as I've learned those, the next level underarmors appear (resistant being the next one). Also with PA mods it appears to be like that, but less consistent.
---
&gt;Next, it should be free to fast travel to Hub 76 but if you are  overemcumbered it will cost 1 cap per 2 lbs over your wt carry limit. So  if you are 100 over your wt carry limit it will cost you 50 caps to  fast travel to the hub from any place on the map.
---
I think this is generally a good idea for various locations. I wouldn't mind being able to fast travel with a penalty when overencumbered, e.g. after doing a quest, to a train station or the next location with a vendor or just some workbenches instead of slow-walking my way towards there...
---
Unfortunately the reason why I specifically went for TSE is because I *didn't* want to go for some bullshit "Bloodied/Instigating+autoaim gimmick VATS crits+nearly undetectable perma-stealth even if you crawl right up an enemy's ass" build. But now that they nerf the *actually good* builds that I *actually like* what am I gonna do? Liquidate all my stuff that now plummeted in value and then grind some more just to get the OP shit *I don't like*? And then it'll probably be next on the chopping block too if I were to actually go about doing that for the real kick in the teeth. ***Fuck that shit***
---
But wait there's more!
---
You can actually turn this into an entire circuit. From the Civic center head to Medical Services. Check for the daily Cop a Squatter. Kill the boss while you're here. Head to the NAR train yard for power armor and mods. Leave and check for the It's A Trap! event just southeast near the train cars. Visit the train cars while you're there and grab a plan. Head East to the flooded railyard for locked containers, terminals to hack, a fusion core, power armor mods, more plans, and a chance at a legendary in the building with punji boards. Swing by the Dropsite and Alpha for even more loot including a magazine.
---
The whole circuit takes as long as you want it to. 30 minutes at a mediocre pace. The flooded trainyard can be a pain because the spawns are random. Radtoads, Gulpers, dogs, anglers, mirelurk kings, ... It varies.
---
There's really a lot to do in that general area. I don't get the server hopping for a single location scheme.
---
The monorail elevator.
---
Nuking Whitesprings sends the robots into HIGH alert and hostile, fight mean ass Enclave sentries with Vertibot support and assaultrons shooting beams down from the roofs and then countdown to experimental cyborg mutants that are part super mutant with sentry bot helmets and tse machine guns and two shot missle launchers. 
---
Haha yessss. Ty!
---
I get your point, but people may very well think about how they want to plan their character, then have a change of heart later, or don't realize certain weapon types are grossly underpowered compared to others and want to change to a build that's more viable.  People shouldn't be at risk of having a gimped character just because they don't do a lot of research at third-party websites.
---
Now, if the weapon types were balanced and all were viable, AND the game itself properly provided more information via tooltips you would have a solid argument, but as it is now, not so much.
---
Place armor.
---
Transfer all out.
---
Transfer all back.
---
Collect.
---
Place again.
---
Get in.
---
Nice suggestion.
---
Yeah they were just getting pissed that someone other than them were making money off the game so nerfed that so people couldn't sell all their dupes any more, they don't give a shit about our gameplay experience. M O N E Y
---
yeah
---
PC I need the brown hat. 
---
Both the plasma gatling and laser Gatling do this. 
---
You haven’t lost the charge on that core. It’s a partially charged on. Plasma cores have charge levels like fusion cores do, it’s shown as their condition. The higher the condition, the more shots left on it. 
---
Combat started to feel good lastly with my 2-shot shotgun. And it had its drawback with the bad accuracy. I don't understand Beth's choice here.
---
u can have 18 of the 19, cause u can’t have both herbivore and carnivore 
---
That isn't deleveling at all, it's simply buying a level 1 card lol
---
De-leveling would be turning a rank 4 card into a rank 3 card in one action, not just buying 3 more ranks...
---
There's only one for sure? Thing with whitesprings is I almost always get a few legendary enimes no star tho. Late I've been getting like 5 with at least one e 2*+ 
---
Theres other areas that always have a "boss" always seem to spawn a useless crowned enemy. Like the damn hospital. I've gotten like 1 legendary to spawn there.  With whitesprings it's a longer run with more opportunities for legendaries. 
---
I'm totally going to check it out tho. Watoga shopping center is not just as bad as whitesprings at least I can watch the noobs that go there get blown up after looting legendary robots. I like doing watoga cause after mayor for a day the legendary robots are passive and just let you farm walk right up and blast em 
---
Yeah, +100% bonus damage was totally less powerful than 30ish aoe damage.. That's sarcasm FYI.    
---
It just shows how these complaints were intended to get a nerf favorable to their play style rather than one for the sake of game balance. What powerful end-game weapons do you have to work towards now, Einstein?    
---
People still haven't learned that Bethesda is a genie in a bottle, you have to be careful what you wish for, or more likely, just stop wishing and quit while you're ahead.    
---
Please, everyone upvote this so the sub can get it through their heads.
---
I placed down my 3 PA's a few days ago in my camp. 100% sure I didn't drop it. My teammate was able to take the parts out of the first PA I put down.
---
I'll give this a go. Thanks 
---
It should be added that a very rare OP weapon wouldn't be a problem, if it wasn't be so easy to dupe it so almost everyone has one...
---
They also need to sort out the ammo problem making it sellable or scrappable, I'm having to drop ammo out my stash to make room..
---
Nah, its working as intended. There's even lore you can read about it on the fabrication terminal. 
---
Not just Zealot's, but all laser and plasma gatlings have this. One of the reasons I quit using them beside unlootable goo/ash piles and durability issues.
---
How long are they active, until you log out or do they persist?
---
&gt; How about buffing the effects that are terrible and no-one wants so they are decent options
---
What are you? A person with a functioning brain or something? Who else would've thought that doing 30% increased damage against a specific enemy type and doing 10% increased damage when aiming down the sights would be nowhere near as sought after as the effects that let you do 100% additional damage with a bit less accuracy and the other one that adds 100% damage in splash that also combines with the perk that adds 100% damage?!
---
Works for me.  I just so happen to have a Furious Explosive gat laying around lol
---
it just works
---
I actually think they should get rid of Class Freak completely.   It makes the penalties trivial.  
---
Mutations should provide benefit but equal penalty at all times.
---
Well written, thanks for making me giggle.
---
Yep treat it like it's own server and feed it players from all servers. Set a population max like 50 or 60 players then create another copy of the Hub and start filling that one. This way you should have the hub alway populated.
---
Why is my opinion irrelevant? Your comment doesn't really fit in this thread. There's a reason "issue" is in quotation marks, it's a tiny thing in the grand scheme of things that's really part of the game instead of being a balance issue.
---
&gt;Really high amounts of resources would make me tempted to kill someone else
---
Players drop their junk when they die. You'd be surprised how many wanted players carry huge amounts of junk. On one character I killed a wanted player near Harper's Ferry two weeks ago. I'm still selling off all the stuff he dropped to this day. Also on YT you can watch many video's showing you exactly this.
---
I would also suggest checking Garrahan Mining HQ.  In the R&amp;D lab they sometimes have loose T-45 pieces on the table.
---
Permanent, unless you use a decontamination arch. RadAways also get rid of them if you do not have the Starched Genes perk at level 2.
---
Only once. Once would solve all my problems.
---
I think a lot of folks have their mic set to push to talk and can listen but unless they here something that makes them want to talk they just pretend like they can't.  I ran around a couple days ago telling Chuck Norris and Confucious jokes to anyone I came across and about 3-4 out of every 5 responded, the next day I ran around just saying hey hows it going and not a peep.  
---
I haven't played in almost a month and I am out of commission for another while longer. When I get back, I'm going to be so confused with all the changes.
---
End with day tripper already
---
Did you ever face a legendary super mutant with an explosive minigun in Fallout 4?
---
Would be good. Can’t take over a spot until it’s destroyed. Nukes would be dropped in unusual places as a result, trying to hit faction strongholds (which would obviously be wiped out and be a free-for-all after the fallout settles). 
---
The ability to get onto the same server over multiple logins would be necessary for continuity and segregating players by level would be necessary so 100+ players aren’t constantly wiping out low level guys. 
---
I'm frozen for at least a few seconds. I'd assume it's still loading. It's better than a load screen, but maybe a loading icon/indicator would help.
---
I also rubber-band back to the entrance a short while after entering the Whitespring. I imagine it could be the same thing but they neglect to lock the player controls so I get a momentary illusion of freedom.
---
I think their only comment on the situation came from Todd Howard himself: "IT JUST WORKS!!!"
---
For real, if they remove legendaries it would be a major step forward for a more fair &amp; skill based PvP.
---
Can confirm Dodgy + Fireproof make a HUGE difference when playing a low hp bloodied build.
---
It was weird.  The other day as I’m finishing a quest, I kept stuttering.  The not connected message would pop up and then go away.   It must have done this like eight times in the span of a minute or so.   Worried me because I thought it might dork up the quest completion.  Anyway, I haven’t been back on since the patch on Xbox, but I hear (read) that it might be more unstable.  Really disappointing.  
---
lolwat?
---
The rifle build against the queen still works just fine - you get plenty of opportunities to cripple as has been the strategy since release. I actually hate not having a rifleman nearby because of how easy it is to force land her (even pre-patch(es)). Rifles have plenty of opportunities to sneak around the battlefield and all along the geometry to clear adds and get some crippling shots off. Shotguns are just fine, too.
---
It's much slower to get her to land with a fast firing heavy gun build and it makes no sense. I think it's bugged, but who knows. There's something about chance-to-cripple not working the way you would expect at 200rpm. You can make her do a jig in the air in looped stagger animations, though, which is fine if.... you know.... any other players bring guns. It's also fine if they get aggravated and leave.
---
The most important part of the queen fight is to get her on the ground where she loses a lot of damage resistance and everyone that's been standing around can rush in. YMMV with landing her with a heavy gun, but it's pretty consistent with shotguns and rifles (and melee once the shotgunners and rifles have done their job).
---
If there are few players around Heavy Guns shine with all the right perks.
---
They could remove the pvp at this point and hardly anyone would care. Especially if they left the hunter/ hunted radio station up.
---
I remember something mentioning the first quarter of 2019 for the DLC that contains the Vendor machines.
---
They don't want you to have fun, especially with lootboxes coming. They want you to be frustrated to the point that you will feel like that you have to buy lootboxes to be able to have fun. Seen this shit so many times in the past, just not from Bethesda.... Sad.
---
So.... my TSE habdmade rifleman will go from tickling the Queen, to making no discernible impact whatsoever? 
---
Great....
---
I don't mind a nerf to TSE for PVE normal mobs (one shoting everything can be a bit boring), and it is really good for PVP, but they need to change the Queen to make it even worth farming her. 
---
I've only seen her killed twice out of ten times I have gone to fight her (I'm level 109). 
---
Now I will be just another useless hangeroner in a Queen fight. 😳
---
Could have an Ammo specific Vendor. Trade him X amount of one type of ammo get Y amount of another type of ammo.
---
This way you are always getting a reduced amount but at least you can get something for the ammo you dont use.
---
Always walk past that robot hoping to hear, "Are yee here to plunder me toys".
---
Yellow slicker hat. Saw it last time on sale in Whitesprings
---
A 100% damage modifier is a broken mechanic, and that's unfair to everyone that plays the game. You should have been aware of that when you spent the time grinding.
---
Oh yeah lots of players carry a massive amount simply because of the weight reducing perks don't work in ur stash it weighs a 10th as much when it's on you. I do that mostly
---
I mean more scoping out a player I know just came from a location that has a fusion core processer at the end of a dungeon or an entire massive quarry where it only has 1 resource that depletes or something. 
---
Basically something really juicy that lures them in, that's hard to collect or is limited in it's respawn rate that you could attack others for. 
---
Do you realize they already did that with Whitespring (more or less) but still no one use that in the way you describe?
---
That would be even better actually cos then I would have the crap i need lmao 
---
I have the calibrated shocks mod if anyone wants to trade/buy it (ps4) 
---
If you needed things to be that unbalanced in order to feel a sense of reward, just go ahead and uninstall now.
---
Shouldn't we be past the point of suggestions? I think Betheda are big boys who can handle updating their own game.    
---
It's the feedback loop of idiotic ideas which attract a lot of other idiots to smash that karma button and make the OP feel all tingly inside, leading them to post more idiotic ideas which Bethesda mistakes as a true demand.
---
These people are too busy coming up with their next karma farming post to actually log into the game, let alone pay for micro transactions, they're not getting their fix from you, Bethesda, so stop taking their advice!  
---
after the latest patch I got a blue screen every half hour. I reinstalled and have not had a blue screen yet, im sure it will come. but re download helps.
---
Great info, thanks mate
---
 You lost me at lootboxes.
---
You wana post some proof of that?
---
Getting huge lock ups when looking at the queen. also getting a lot of c ashes lately
---
I'm confused why it's such a decrease. Taking it to 25% buff seems just an odd amount. And it seems (from reading comments) that it's coming into effect because people don't want to get killed in one shot in PvP and that with a TSE weapon you can clear a crowd of enemies out and it's not fair. 
---
If I've been out grinding the queen for a TSE or ended up trading my arm and leg for one before the duping got out of hand damn right I want it to kick the shit out of things. 
---
Agree that would be fun! But don't hold yourself back for thinking pvp is not worth it atm. Aside from the junk loot it can also make you rich in caps
---
This would be a separate zone/server. So new players would not have access to it. New players would have the normal experience but at lvl 50 complete the questline to access the new Hub76.
---
New players and Hub76 patrons would never meet.
---
Yeah, I personally am not interested in PvP at all. Just want to be able to play the game and have fun without having to use 1k bullets and 18 deaths to kill something
---
I’ve yet to encounter (long may it stay that way) any arseholes on Xbox. Everyone I’ve come across has been really helpful 😁
---
Listen to the stars my son
---
Instigating = First that acts like a 2shot legendary. Then you're back to normal dmg. Ok for lower HP mobs.. less useful vs Queen etc.    
---
   
---
Does it really matter? You're still going to get rektd and cry about it.
---
When have I ever cried about pvp?
---
It's worth it on just a junk basis..it's just a lot of players are playing it super friendly and there's probably ways to encourage raiding. 
---
I've pvpd so rarely that few times I've tried I always hit them first cause I forget I have to reinitiate PVP every time someone dies. Lost a bunch of caps that way 
---
Try the "hunting store" vendor bot in Whitesprings. 
---
Addendum:  nuking an opposing faction’s stronghold would be far too easy as of now. Silo runs are brief, and aside from ammo/repair there’s little cost for high level players. 
---
In keeping with immersion, the story on the rebuilding servers could be that the silos have run out of raw materials. To allow nukes to continue to fly, each faction could have a collective stash that’s contributed for whatever is needed to build a nuke (say something like 1k fuel, 1k steel, 250 nuke material, etc).  While some players may have enough in their own stash, it would quickly require the taking over of resource nodes to supply the group effort.  Perhaps have nodes taken in this mode contribute a portion (or all) to a faction stash used for building the stronghold and nukes.  
---
This happens to me because of how I place certain wall decor (ie a flag that touches two walls at a corner will be ‘floating’). But there’s a lot more than that which will be ‘floating’ depending on how your decorate. My advice is the try to build blueprints in stages (at a workshop), place what works and keep adding to them to test what you can place where in your structure to avoid this. 
---
Exactly my point. I wouldn't have spent weeks of my time trying to get a TSE for a mere 20% increase from a regular handmade. Might as well not even be a legendary item any more, throw it in the trash where Bethesda is going with all this nerfing
---
Ok but 3k melee damage is super balanced. They should ignore this community because they're all pretty dumb tbh. 
---
Innovative. I like it.
---
Guys, I'm asking those who doesn't agree with this nerf, can we do something? I mean we could make a petition against it, asking them to reconsider the nerf, for example change the 20, 25% values to 50% at least... or improve TS accuracy... What do you think? Or does a petition already exists?
---
I don't see suggestion posts anymore, I just see "SKIP"
---
Sry, you don't get more health just by lvling up, but you do get 5 health per point in Endurance. Plus all the perks, resistances, and stat bonuses you get on higher lvl gear.
---
I've heard talk of loot boxes too, though haven't seen any hardcore proof yet
---
I would love to be able to work towards something with less RNG. I would happily play a resource sapping event if for example I knew there was a guaranteed 3 star drop at the end.
---
Also there is so much good high level loot, why not put it behind challenges and bosses instead of server hopping and RNG.
---
People will do whatever you incentivise them to do and currently that is server hopping.
---
&gt; but I imagine you should either kill them when they're moving
---
Yes, because they have a reason to move when they can just sit still and shoot you back. (And even if you do they'll still have Assassin protectiin on top of the undoubtedly heavy defensive perk setup they're running which means if you can't instantly kill them there they'll just stop and heal up all that now meaningless damage)
---
&gt;take shots at range while hidden from them until their armor breaks
---
Pretty sure they'll at least be able to get a shot in or two from a Gauss Rifle, Hunting Rifle, etc. no matter how good your cover is in the dozens upon dozens of shots you'll need to break their armor which could be from anywhere up to 200% condition.
---
Compared to other 2nd slot legi effects it will still be one of the best
---
Yes it does, at least for me 
---
This. Have yet to see any proof that this is even being considered. 
---
Bloodied and Furious already have potential to match TSE.  Post-nerf they will be the go-to option.
---
Being able to hold only one bobble head of each type is actually a good idea. I'd counterbalance it by making them weightless though. Maybe that way I'd actually use them instead of hoarding "for a rainy day".
---
It wouldn't be unfair if there weren't thousands out there from duping. Even then, unless they're used for PvP it doesn't effect you or anyone else. So like I was saying before. Nerf the damage output from TSE's to players. Not Pve
---
I don't know if it would be "that easy". You could have players preventing you to send a Nuke. Also, I don't know how it works now because I never bothered to check, but I guess we can't just gatling-shoot nukes from the same silo , given each player had a card. 
---
So with the current factions being Responders, Free-state, Rose's Raiders, Enclave, Brotherhood, Order of Mystery and Lone Wanderers, you'd have to choose who you bomb... as you'd max get three choices if your faction managed to send all three nukes.
---
You can find previous threads datamining the patches which show they are already added to the code. 
---
Also, when the whole devroom fiasco got out, a video on YouTube showed people opening these lunchboxes which they found in the dev room.
---
You can find both pretty easily.
---
Same brother
---
I know right! First thing I bought from the Atom store was the Nuke cola stash box.
---
It's in the code and there is a video with someone opening one, when they got into the devroom
---
You can use any 2 handed weapon you like the look of but super sledge seems to be the best for damage.
---
This is my build I use. I can swap out melee for heavy weapons which is real nice for some situations (I use heavy weapons in nuke silos) it dosent have the perk card for less weight of meds but you can carry lots of food around instead. And it's got rad sponge and ghoulish for nukezones. Just share one of them and you are good to go.

---
Thx for calling out I didnt know
---
I want that garbage! Only one more piece till I have a full legendary set. 
---
The western half of the map (forest, ash heap, toxic valley) has pretty low lvl caps.
---
Always struggle to choose drum mag (20 bullets) or perforating mag (8 bullets) for combat shotgun... Yes, armor penetration is good, but 8 bullets... but on the other side 20 bullets, but no penetration... Yes, there is stinging, but it's still only 12 bullets with weak armor penetration...
---
Nerf the explosive damage that's fine with me but the TS effect you might as well just not bother with TSE weapons after this. If this is there solution to them being duped so much then how about the bloodied weapons that got duped as well because I know plenty of them got into the mix. 
---
This. Or just don't load players into a sever where they're in the blast zone... 
---
I’ve seen this happen in other games. People start crying about stuff and developers listen a bit too much. The result is a game far too easy to be fun and rewarding. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a5hsxs/fallout_76_v_10310_changelog_based_on_game_data/
---
They weren't added here, they've been added many patches before but as you can see, they changed a few things about them in the latest patch as well. They will have game changing effects, like damage and speed boosts etc.... Only purchasable via the Atom shop based on the ATX prefix.
---
They are called lunchboxes. They contain temparary effects.
---
Can you please show me proof of lootboxes.
---
Agree with everything, we need more of those pre patch feed the people events.
---
Also make the airdrops lootable for everyone again. Or maybe add an option to lock the crate at the terminal if you really don't want other players to acces the crate.
---
The same reason anyone ever played any creation engine title. Large open world, set your own goals, do as much as you can within the game's limits.    
---
It's an escape from the nonsense we call real life where finally something can have meaning again, not these superficial displays of obedience out of fear, you can actually be the bad-ass you were always supposed to be without anyone trying to put you in jail or kill you over it.
---
Everything is a great idea except the shared stash. I'm 100% opposed to that as it destroys the challenge of inventory management and it makes it easy to just have a mule character without buying a second instance of the game
---
No, there is a cap on armor pen
---
rofl man. are you for real? who cares what they are called? They will be sold for money and they will contain game altering buffs. Can it be more pay to win than that? 
---
There already is a legendary effect which gives more firerate but it takes the same slot as explosive.
---
Maybe add something challenging to it as well instead of just 5 mole rats.
---
No it didn't. It said air recycling would be disabled and you'd suffocate. The post clearly states that you'd have to hack the mainframe to enable the life support again
---
Where can you get the normal fireman outfit ?
---
Have been searching for this thing forever, but didn't see it in any of the spreadsheets or wikis.
---
Also did you know that there is a vast variety of mining helmet colours ?
---
The same is supposed to be with hard hats but they're bugged
---
Nice list.  I like most of them.
---
A single nuke would wipe out everything inside of its area of effect, making it an extremely potent weapon for wiping out a stronghold. Currently, you can average one per hour (3 silos, each requiring a 3hr rebuild).  Not having any resource cost for them would drastically increase their use as factions work together to launch to take out as many strongholds as they can.  As of now, we are limited to launching 1 per hour (if you launch then immediately go to another silo you won’t be able to launch again until that window has passed, I’ve tried). 
---
Since were talking land grabs here, I don’t see lone wanderers, mistresses of mystery, and enclave members as viable factions (aren’t we all enclave members?). It would also simplify things as each is against the other two but could potentially cooperate. 
---
I think he meant stuff like kneecapper (chance for insta crippling legs in this case)
---
They will have random effects. You can buy them in bundles. How much more lootboxy should they be before they can be called lootboxes? 
---
The Whitesprings is a zone with high level enemies and no stash boxes. Exactly the thing I'd avoid if I was looking for a place to dump my junk and repair my broken armor and weapons.
---
Wish they had this worked out a little better before release. Most other effects just suck. Would have rather have them work to balance the other effects and maybe change around which effect slot it works in. They're basically nerfing ranged weapons as a whole by doing this. Since TS was a "mandatory" effect to have removing that makes the current game even less balanced with melee. I would have been fine with explosive going away entirely 
---
also two shot on a "weak" gun didn't do all that much but turn a bad gun halfway decent. Now those guns will basically do nothing. 
---
Yep. So much so that I started a new character, different build type, whole new approach to the game. Even better 2nd time round and still discovering new things every time I play.
---
Can you try:
---
Place the armor down.
---
Transfer all the parts out.
---
Transfer all the parts back in.
---
Collect it.
---
Place and get in.
---
Fast travel.
---
Let me know if that works.
---
The paid fast travel system in general bothers me. I'm completely broke after having to fast travel to and from my camp and train stations multiple times after getting quest rewards. And moving my camp once charged me 130caps instead of 39
---
$5 for a TSE combat shotgun, people been selling them for weeks.
---
Have never had a blue screen,  not during the beta, not before or after any of the patches. Maybe it’s your system?
---
Hmm, I know it was removed back in early December due to bugs they said.  I hadn't seen it back since, but I hope you are right!
---
How is that relevant here? That's on who exactly? Who made it easy to dupe for months when it's been a known issue since beta? 
---
&gt;haven't seen any hardcore proof yet    
---
Did ya look?
---
I've never been to Top Of The World. Mostly due to the 50+ leveled players.
---
Agreed. My controversial suggestion. Remove fast travel except to camp and workshops.
---
I played a postapo online unofficial fallout game and knowing that somebody could be placed in the particular random encounter I am in was what made it so thrilling, and when we wanted more thrill, we were actively trying to be olaced into random encounters of other people. The biggest fight that was initiated that way counted around 50 people and several different player factions, because everyone was calling their backups.
---
When PvP servers comw out im switching to those full time. Not necessarily to shoot everyone on sight. Rather to be analysing if I should expose my position with 'hello' emote, or rather keep being hidden and reduce the risk.
---
Amd that's exactly why I tell people who want to panic buy two shot guns now to get an instigating, anti armour furious or bloodied instead. 
---
TSE is dead. It's all about IE, BE, FE, AAE now.
---
Idk if killing lowbies is good work, but ok, i will try.
---
Wow dude, impressive. Don’t have and haven’t had a TSE (yet) but can’t say it’s ruined the gaming experience for me. Sure it takes longer and is harder to kill things but I ain’t come across a critter I ain’t been able to kill yet. 
---
But each to their own, I suppose. 
---
They could easily fix the two shot vats bug by making it a single bullet and increase the damage by whatever percentage they feel like nerfing/buffing 
---
Probably because it should be less than, say 30% to super mutants, ghouls, and insects? Those are only useful against one type of enemy so they should be higher than anything else.. buuut if you get the godly TSE then you're still getting two shots *and* two explosions so then it becomes the top tier unless you use vats, and then vats affixes are better, see how balancing works?
---
Not true, if player dont spot you (perception), you will be completli invisible.
---
What's your total damage reduction? 
---
No, haven't been all that worried about it tbh
---
Upgrade your gpu and monitor
---
I’m batting 100 for SBQ kills (1 out of 1). Don’t have a TSE, only a slightly legendary 50cal. Wasn’t alone, and burned through 2500 or so rounds, but we brought the bitch down. It’s the journey, man, not the destination. ;)
---
Happened to me just yesterday. I was at my camp, had some water boiling irl, went to check it and I heard someone mumbling on his mic, and in a second my house was destroyed and I was too. It didn't take me 3 seconds to get there and I was already dead, I just stood there looking at the guy in power armour looking for my junk or whatever. I'll make sure to have a recording next time.
---
Pacifist mode, no means to return fire since I wasn't even near the keyboard.
---
I don't have much and all that repairing hurt, on top of the caps I lost because I got killed in PvP.
---
That it's never happened to you it doesn't mean it NEVER happens. I won't say it's a common thing because I don't know, but it definitely happens and it shouldn't if I chose pacifist mode. 
---
Imagine nuking grafton and getting a legendary grafton monster. It’d be like 10x bigger than it normally is and it could shove it’s giant gross arms in the ground and spurt its oil from holes that spawn wherever hostiles are standing. 
---
The balancing of dmg for most guns is fucked even with 100 percent boost many are still super weak. Revolvers are pretty much worthless without a bunch of perks as well as most ranged weapons .
---
If everything is 75 percent harder to kill they had better start dropping the correct loot. No more fucking drills and flares if it takes forever to take down an enemy. 
---
I can't believe they at one point"fixed" drops 
---
&gt;Yes, because they have a reason to move when they can just sit still and shoot you back.
---
Quite obviously, there are many reasons to move and not stand still on a position all the time.
---
&gt; Assassin protectiin on top of the undoubtedly heavy defensive perk 
---
On one char I run with a full assassin's gear, except one arm (which is chameleon), have the max barbarian bonus, the agility non-pa bonus and with 8 points in END I have the fireproof and lifegiver perk. You can still kill me without an outreagous effort. Yesterday I died 5 times in a row in a 3 vs 3 battle from different weapons.
---
&gt; they'll just stop and heal up all that now meaningless damage 
---
Which brings us back to the disadvantage of standing still
---
&gt; Pretty sure they'll at least be able to get a shot in or two ..... no matter how good your cover is 
---
PA has a mod that can detect enemies shooting at you through your compass. But without it, you can stay concealed at range in any fight with chameleon. I do it all the time. I move position as soon as I see the opponent is facing away from me.
---
&gt; dozens upon dozens of shots you'll need to break their armor which could be from anywhere up to 200% condition. 
---
Yup, pvp is more than just one shotting your opponent. I've had fights lasting 20 to 30 minutes. If someone has 200% repaired sentinel armor it's indeed much more difficult and tedious to break it, but as pointed out, sentinel only works when standing still, which no one is all the time.
---
So no, I'm not convinced someone can be an unkillable God. The theory doesn't hold up and I haven't experienced it in hundreds of fights I've had.
---
So TSE shotguns only lose ~1/9th of their total power? AFAIK TS only adds a single pellet to shotguns, not double the number of pellets. For other, non-multishot weapons sure that would alleviate the issue somewhat.
---
I can’t help but think this was a sexual innuendo turning dark really quick 
---
Okay. Can someone please show me where it says you can not have both? All it says is that you can "eat meat but not veggies with no disease."
---
Meaning,you can eat meat without getting disease, but fruit and veg will still give you disease. 
---
The combat rifle has the highest per shot damage of the three assault type rifles I believe. People tend to perfer the handmade for it's larger magazine size, though.
---
Sadly, with guns right now, unless you have a really powerful two shot or explosive (which are being nerfed) you really need to either sneak attack or use a VATS build to do good damage. Automatic receivers are even better for charging ghouls, but it conflicts with Rifleman, so that become problematic.
---
I feel like that what they may be doing with the pvp modem use it to test PVP balance and then maybe split the two but I doubt they'd split it. Otherwise I doubt they'll ever be able to to balance pve and PVP 
---
Aw man, I hope you're not expecting people on this sub to actually think rather than bandwagon along with whichever baby can cry the loudest?    
---
I agree with you though, onehunnit
---
Because that makes a difference when melee can get 5k damage...
---
I have TSE pump and i was trying to get rid of it anyway, but my noobis loved girlfriend was using TSE lever action i bought her on market and it was only way for her to enjoy game, bcos she hate "losing". Gotta find her new meta gun.
---
And about XP, we wanted to make new characters, but it is so sloooow, and you have to find all plans/recipes again, so no, i wouldnt make new character, i hate grinding xps.
---
Once you start unlocking the higher-end mods for it you can transform it into an absolute beast 
---
Why don’t you move your camp somewhere that doesn’t get attacked? I hardly ever have anything show up at mine
---
Great Idea!
---
Maybe they were chatting to a distant teammate and just dicking around. 
---
Good, better go buy some lootboxes when they come out in February so you can get some of that damage back for you and your buddies.
---
One is _always_ near the Charleston train station. He’s only 10. There’s one that occasionally spawns near the dam ruins in Charleston too. 
---
The point of wearing full sentinels isn't pvp really, it's just gear to troll people with because they can't figure out how you are taking zero damage because they haven't even heard of sentinels because it's so rare. Source: I'm lv188 and have found *one* piece of cavaliers so far and zero sentinels. It's extremely rare
---
Very interesting, thank you for taking your time to write that up.
---
u gain nothing from the opposite. so u gain no benefits to eating fruits n veggies with carnivore. u just can’t have both bc it’s too overpowered. eating meat AND non meats with no chance of disease? so there has to be a balance. 
---
you can have one or the other and tbh you don’t really get to choose it. i had herbivore and man did it suck  
---
i have 16 only because i didn’t want plague walker, empath, and herbivore. which took forever to get rid of just those three. 
---
Thanks for the insight, I happen to be a raider myself haha. Lately for fun I have been RP’ing as a “bounty hunter” hunter. Get a bounty, go to vault 76, wear dense armor and fireproof. After you survive their initial shot they’ll be so stunned and it’s an easy kill after that. Many times it’s high level people who don’t even bother to stash their junk first and also pride over dying so they seek revenge several times as well. I’ve farmed several thousand caps and a fair bit of junk in an hour using this method but I like the workshop thing your describing better!
---
What, I did not know it could do that.
---
But what if you wanted to move your C.A.M.P. for free?
---
Wow. I’m like the only one in my group, still playing fo76. And the nerf to TS hits me so bad that I feel like quitting. 
---
Can you make monsters, less of a bullet sponge then ?
---
They shoulda made the other effects less shit to begin with. 
---
I was thinking workshops were going to be this at first when they were talking about working together to rebuild. Then we got the mess we have now. 
---
I would definitely prefer some more cooperative events that aren't the SBQ. 
---
Yeah, this happens. Pacifist mode doesn't stop you taking damage and when you're  level 20 or under and the person attacking you is 250 the % reduced damage really doesn't make any difference. Happened to my friend the other day and they got their entire camp and workshops wasted, if I hadn't been online they wouldn't have had the resources to rebuild because they're low level
---
Even if it's not one shot, 2/3 easily happens before you can run for cover or fast travel away. And even if you do they tend to follow. 
---
 I think each 100 should have its own servers tbh, I wouldn't mind a longer wait time if it meant I wasn't being griefed by people who've already had a chance to build their characters....
---
Two shot never actually increased DPS by 100%
---
Assuming they transferred it straight from FO4, the extra bullet is unaffected by mods meaning if you were to give a Two Shot weapon a Hardened receiver, it was still fire the second bullet as if it were a standard bullet.
---
I'm unsure about perks however.
---
They need to hire that modder who made Do it your Shelf
---
I see.  So it works with all ballistic guns but not energy guns.
---
Next Christmas? Are you out of your mind? 
---
Sorry to break it to you but f4 classical was better
---
So what do you think will become flavour of the month, ie, be duped to high heaven? 
---
Missile for sky and others for ground, at least this works for me.
---
You can invite them from the map too. More dangerous, of course, taking your eyes off the scenery. 
---
It would make sense to make it 50% damage for TS. Explosive wise just don't let it stack with the demo perk and fix the bobble head stacking that somehow has been around since day one. 
---
No, those effects should be doing more...a lot more.  +30% vs. enemy types is complete crap considering how much farming one would have to do just to get their particular brand of weapon.
---
all rise (a legendary heavy rocket sledgehammer) from the mayor for a day quest is the weapon that everyone uses for heavy melee build because it does pretty good damage and it has the “90% reduced weight” effect, i still keep it as my main weapon even tho i have an instigating super sledge and others as secondaries
---
All ballistic RIFLES, not all ballistic guns. It doesn't work with heavy guns or pistols.
---
So, Combat Rifle, Assault Rifle, Handmade, Hunting Rifle and Gauss Rifle (which is an energy weapon, but the projectile counts as ballistic).
---
One of the community manager guys said they're looking into it but who knows. I'd love love love to use energy weapons as my main but they're so useless now. 
---
Plasma flamer is so fucking cool but it's pretty much worthless. A buff might make the quad and two shot versions in my stash more valuable than the carry weight they cost 
---
This is exactly what I expected when they did the original update.. I was disappointed.
---
They’re scattered about on the floor too.
---
card trading would also be fun. 😀
---
That's what happen if you just skip to the mission objective. In the terminal,the husband of the founder,explains how he made it with the help of his friend at rob-co.
---
The guy was the tony stark of fallout.
---
Top of the World had ***loads*** of flora and legendary muties the one time I got to see it nuked. The area near the train station had a pack of colonel gutsies with a 3 star boss and the mole miners that spawned around the lodge vendor building had an okay amount of legendaries too. 
---
If you die in power armor while you have another modded pieces in your inventory next time you spawn it will be applied as well. 
---
It's cool but.. you have to lug around another piece of armor and it requires dying and damaging your power armor. 
---
Not sure if it's been patched either 
---
&gt; prime receivers 
---
"Hey we heard you liked dumping stockpiles of ammo into bullet sponge ammo so we thought that you'd love to waste stockpiles of expensive to craft ammo that waste a bit less ammo against this one type of enemy! Can't freely switch between the two types of ammo on one gun so you don't waste that precious ammo type against non-bonus enemies though!"
---
Actually, two-shot isn't double the bullets, it's simply adding another one.
---
For an example, let's say you get a two-shot laser rifle, with the mod "Beam Splitter", you fire 4 beams instead of one, and with two-shot, you get 5 beams. Same with the shotgun, if it fires 5 pellets, it then fires 6 pellets. Now this barely does any damage as it is, and with this nerf, why even bother?
---
You're not the only one who has a collection of weightless armor in their chest because "some day I'll main this gear and save weight".
---
I don't have any expectations. They've been "looking into it" since Fallout 3 and we have all the same bugs in 76. Even the plasma hit detection somehow got reverted and re-fixed. O.o
---
Energy weapons are an aesthetic-only choice in Fallout. :P
---
The laser musket in 4 and New Vegas's beam splitter weren't bad, but they're sadly not here.
---
I found a two-shot plasma and immediately put a flamer on it. It's kind of fun for about 2 minutes just mowing everything down with Godzilla breath.
---
Too bad plasma cells aren't as common as fusion cells. I'd really like to burn up the 8K fusion cells I have.
---
Willfully dense is a strong way to describe the low level players you are trolling with a gear set you bought from dupers. Get over yourself, every single person with full sentinels bought it from the markets and uses it to troll people and collect their caps as they try to figure out why  some asshole won't die
---
That's a good idea too.
---
Why do people think it's completely new servers ?
---
It  could easily just be Hunter hunted but  anyone who tuned in  is now open PvP.
---
I never said they should keep explosive as it is.
---
Just saying removing drops with both effects is an easier fix then to nerf it. 
---
Those little one off events are one of the things I like most about these games. I saw a bear washing a urinal with a newsboy cap on, two bears taking a bath together while on brushes the other's back. These little things are my loading screens now thanks to photo mode.
---
Ever hear of duplex ammo?  It used to be a thing. Two bullets loaded into a single case, fired simultaneously using the same propellant charge.  In 308 it was known as the M198. 
---
The idea was to increase hit probability. 
---
I hope they check the vendors gear because most of use sell useless (to us) legendary items. 
---
I completely agree. Damage output for regular guns is complete crap, which is why I was trying so hard to get a gun with some actual damage (TSE) now they're about to ruin those, so what's even the point?
---
I thought In heard about that one before.  I didnt want to hack my armor.  Was hoping it was allowed now.
---
Second level isn't really a quest atra
---
FYI, that was addressed in the [patch](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/7hpeHkKxyM6aMWUCCIkeW6/fallout-76-patch-notes-january-10-2019) from January 10th...
---
**"Weapons**: Fixed an issue where bashing an enemy with certain weapons would add the projectile to the enemy's inventory."  
---
...so if you are on a console, this won't work the next time you patch the game.
---
Vendered my bomber jacket by mistake :(
---
Butts
---
What I was afraid of, got a hard choice to make.
---
Boy friend and I are both on console! 
---
This isn't discussion. Your broken weapon got fixed. Suck it up.
---
So much set up but so worth it! 
---
My main concern is the per-bullet damage, and six quick lever shots are usually enough to resolve whatever issue is in my face... But with the combat rifle I'd go through all twenty and they'd still be kicking
---
Instigating lever rifle is a 1shot headshot kill for most scorched/ghouls
---
I understood you meant remove drops with *both* of them, not *either* of them. Regardless of two-shot explosive is currently too powerful compared to anything else. As is two-shot, with even less downsides. So either nerfing or removing both altogether seems sensible to me.
---
Apart from bloodied explosive, which is way more OP than TSE
---
Just make automatic weapons do "two shot" and semi and non-automatic do "explosive"
---
How much for the prime auto handmade plan? GT: Evil Bob 78
---
You mean... Like Whitesprings is? Whitesprings is essentially the player hub of the map. All of the things you asked for are there, including a fully functioning shopping mall, plus it gets nuked a lot which always helps bring in players.
---
It's such a flawed balance choice though, consider the fact that melee gets mutations that increases it's melee damage. So now, TSE which is hard to find, is going to be only equal to the bonus damage a power fist user can get from rolling around in radioactive goo...
---
I would like to be able to trade cards you don’t want for caps
---
They should just make slap damage not scale and have it at a fixed amount like 1 or 10 or whatever. So no one could be one-shot who doesn't want to pvp. All of the issues would have been solved by this...
---
These people will defend their actions by saying it is within the limits of the game and that war is not fair.
---
And they're right about that as well.
---
Doesn't make these type of scumbagtactics in a game less sad though. 
---
Best not to think about it too much, most people are decent beings fortunately.
---
...But melee doesn't have same reach as ranged. 
---
So true lol
---
The first instigating rifle I find will be my favourite child, but until then...
---
It's a fun gun and the +50 damage reduction means I just stand, aim, and shred. The 3 level repair perk (forgot what it's called) and maxed gunsmith makes durability pretty decent.
---
I've read overdrive helps with the Gatling since it will crit out of vats. I can craft the drug but need to get the mire to find the one hard to get ingredient. 
---
And I'm right with you on the TSE stuff. 
---
With the assaultron head your wish can become a reality : ) 
---
It'd be rad if we could somehow add energy receivers to regular weapons to fire energy ammo for certain buffs like burn damage etc. 
---
Funny tho. They added ultracite lasers which is perfect example of what you're saying. It's literally just a aesthetic choice. It's funny they gave it a tiny damage boost. No idea why they even bothered. 
---
Btw two shot assaultron head is not bad at all ( it charges way way slower than fallout 4 for some reason but when it works it's hella cool. Though the regenerating bug seems to be big time effecting the gun. It shows it doing major damage but the health jumps up and you only do maybe a third of the damage it initially shows.
---
Not that it matters I'm sure with the two shot nerf it'll be just as terrible as any other laser weapon 
---
I’ll try a scorched today.
---
No StAsH bOxEs... You just blind? Go inside the resort to the shopping mall.... It's a high level area because of all the players there. The world adapts the NPC level according to the highest levelled player in the area, hell go to Watoga and you'll even have this mechanism. 
---
wow this post got 100+downvoted today from this morning. hoever every word of the op is gold. two shot weapons just fine. explosive weapons over powered.
---
Weapons firing more than one projectile is not a new or special thing from shot to Flechette to frangible shells. The duplex that I'm familiar with actually had two differently shaped projectiles that did not fly apart - they had different purposes. See also Glasier round and the "k-bullet".
---
But supporting opening post, it would make more sense that each projectile in a duplex ammo would do 50% of one .308 and not 200% (or would offer armor penetration or similar).
---
&gt;We hate TSE weapons because we don’t have them
---
I have. Still hating. Oneshooting players with slap damage is just insane.
---
Some good ideas, some bad ideas.   
---
We need a better way of presenting lists to make sure Bethesda are aware of what bits the community actually agree with and what bits are just one guys mad dream :)   
---
In fallout it does the opposite hehe 
---
They could bring back Caravan, and have tables set up specifically for it. 
---
My comment was a bit of a joke found in a Portal trailer. 
---
true. pvp in this game 99% of the time just griefing.
---
Nah. Whitespring hotel would be better. 
---
I have a green asylum workers hat, and an asylum workers hat in “Forrest”? I’d looks white idk, I scrapped a red one the other day, but I think they are becoming more common spawns I found them in fort defiance the past 2 times I was there
---
Holy crap that has to be a record. 
---
Its under a year old console do i dont think so
---
It's wild when you think of all the guns in the game and how rarely I've ever used them. Single action, assault rifle, combat rifle, most pipe weapons, 10 mm, mg42 
---
The projectiles in the M198 were meant to come apart and have ever so slightly different trajectories, hence the concept of increasing hit probability.  It was a dud concept. While true it wouldn’t deal double damage, we’re not using real ballistics here either. If we were, snipers would be having to aim like we have to with the Fatman and AGL to hit targets at distance and these shots would do decreasing damage corresponding to range.  
---
Still. Not the same thing as the post describes. You only get workbenches in the bunker and there's no stash boxes there. It's often a nuke zone and fast travel to it is costly unlike the proposed free system with Vault 76.
---
true. but 99% of the player does not care with pvp only pve content.
---
Ah, console, yeah been seeing reports of that, don't think youre alone.. PC seems more stable at the moment.
---
Still, not the same thing as the post describes. You only get workbenches in the bunker and there's no stash boxes there. It's often a nuke zone and fast travel to it is costly unlike the proposed free system with Vault 76.
---
The toon's name better be Jim Duggan.
---
Really, and go outside into the nuke zone... It needs to be an area that almost all level of players can get too
---
Can't wait for no pvp so I can have a camp in peace..
---
Forever with starched genes L2
---
You don't really have to change anything or do anything other than die with it in your inventory. I'm thinking you could potentially stack calibrated shocks with excavator armor.plus the 100 extra carry weight bug and you can carry anything hah 
---
They should take a page from zennimax's approach. Zenni provides genuinely difficult end game raid content in ESO, while still providing challenging content for new/mid-range players. Explosive guns should be for top tier players, who need the fire power for raid-type enemies.
---
Yup! I really wish the whole “Bethesda Plz” list the mods came out with was updated more often, that way they would have a better idea of what we want, and people like me can stop spouting the same idea every week..
---
Someone ban this arsehat.
---
Coal and gold. 
---
Cries in 50 cal
---
Or what if you don't use a static camp site?
---
No worries, it goes to zero value when offered to a trader :)
---
I would agree with one exception. The damage mitigation perks should make it so you cannot be one shotted. I'm fine with instant death if I'm wearing nothing but damage perks because it's my choice, but right now it seems like damage mitigation perks are worthless against 2se
---
A major concern Vault Tech had was that the residents of 76 would become too reliant on the resources in the vault. By opening the vault up again as a central hub it would only inhibit our mission, to spread out and repopulate.
---
In my opinion the hub would be a great idea but should be elsewhere, built from the ground up or within an existing structure.
---
My personal prediction is that we will use the ATLAS "observatory" to teraform an area of the map so we can colonize it easier.
---
Aaand you've missed the actual problem with two shot explosive weapons, so now two shot weapons are gonna suck and the main issue will still mostly exist
---
I am a unclear on how it works.
---
Firstly, let's say I finished claiming an UNCLAIMED workshop up in the north side of the map that no-one cares about. Am I now susceptible to PvP damage from anyone, anywhere, anytime on the map? 
---
Or am I only vulnerable when that hostile starts to counter-claim the workshop and thus initiates the contest and I am notified someone is claiming it.
---
Secondly, if I start a claim on an UNCLAIMED workshop, am I vulnerable to PvP damage? Does vulnerability end after finishing claiming? If I leave the area and never finish the claim, am I still vulnerable to PvP damage?
---
Thirdly, if I start to claim a CLAIMED workshop, I initiated the contest. Are you saying I am vulnerable to all/any players (not just the defendant). Does this vulnerability go away or so long as I am messing with workshops of any kind, I am always in PvP mode?
---
All players can’t get to top of the world though. 
---
Jess. If these go out many many of us are quitting. Some of us ground hundreds of hours to meet the 2 shot meta. Youre spitting in our faces. We will return in kind.
---
I went and read about the M198. Nice tip, and it's interesting, but funny enough they were obsoleted as not having any advantage. It's more trivia than anything else.
---
We are talking about "ye olde video game physics", but it's kind of obvious the logic falls apart. You aren't using different ammunition for two-shot weapons so .... How does that work? A built-in "bullet chopper" splits it on the way out in the same manner as the beam splitter? It's nonsensical (which is fine, video games).
---
The OP should obviously not be serious and pokes fun at the "video game sense" in the last line and a reference to long obsoleted ammunition is interesting but pretty unrelated. Fun read, though!
---
I've been thinking the same thing. "Static" gun racks. :)
---
Maybe the plan/recipe for it should require the displayed weapon as a component? 
---
Thank you to those who have PM'd, I am around this evening after work so will sort it out with you then! I will also check the item requests you have and will get back to you!
---
Well said. I stopped using my explosive shotgun build due to the whole one-shot mechanic, but my new unarmed build still two-shots lvl 91 glowing deathclaws... There is a serious lack of balance.
---
Nope. We are rewarded with nerfs.
---
Does it always happen? Is it when you place it to get in or exclusively when you get out? If it's while your placing make sure you're not technically dropping it and instead are "placing it" one will let others take it and the other just set it down for you to get in
---
I’m going to pick explosive prefix over assassins everytime.
---
I’m going to pick bloodied over zealots everytime.
---
I’m going to pick two shot over nocturnal everytime.
---
I’m going to pick instigating over berserkers everytime..
---
The point is NO ONE cares about the pre fixes besides these 4. If you want everyone to use the same shit boring stuff get rid of these OPPPPP prefixes. Or better yet don’t play the game at all.
---
Makes as much sense as armor piercing magazines. And suppressors/brakes decreasing range/accuracy or scopes magically reducing the spread pattern on a shotgun. 
---
Isn't C2 the magazine and V9 the plan?
---
Wouldnt recommend it. Nerfs going out hard m8
---
But some of them are also dupers and bobblehead stackers with mum's credit card sets of pvp gear. Had one show up at my place in a santa outfit once.
---
It was annoying but their are far less griefers on console or at least in my encounters but when I did run into them it was pretty annoying to say the least till the queen fight then you at least hoped for a couple to be there lol
---
Wonder how someone would have collected every item in the game at once? Where have I heard of this? Weird.... 
---
That's fine, but the bobble head still stacks, meaning if you got one shot before by x weapon with bobble stacks, you will be one shotted again by x weapon with bobble stacks.
---
As for whatever meta develops melee is still leaps and bounds stronger than any tse/ts variant in terms of sustained damage. Why are you so hostile?
---
They are.The new PvP mode will be a different mode from the main menu,any teabaggers should be there and take it as much as they dish it.
---
Bloodied, for sure.  It's the only other option that's +200% damage without ramping up like Furious has to.
---
For a beginning, you cant get both. The ürasinh carnivore and herbivore already cancel each other out. You are already omnivore.
---
Surface loot is instanced now so you loterally have to wait 20 hr for your reset
---
I'd love to be able to dye mine. I wear it all the time but it doesn't fit with all outfits as well.
---
I am level 200 now and I am 100% sure we are not talking about dropping the frame instead of placing the frame. The scenario I am concerned about refers only to exiting the power armor character is currently in.
---
At the crevasse dam spawn point, if something does spawn there is it on the road? Specifically looking for the trick or treaters. 
---
No you dont.
---
You can get stealthboys.
---
You can use an item for jetpack mode.
---
That's the point. :)
---
The goal in the last line was to point out someone would inevitably show up to say "that makes sense and is balanced" in regards to the beam splitter, but has no argument with two-shot-from-one-standard-round or (to your point) magazines that "sprinkle" armor penetration on loaded rounds.
---
How do I know someone would do that? Because they've been doing it since 3....
---
The rewards from the order wuestline are upgradeable to 50 so long as you keep the original reward. Lotta folks don’t know this and toss the rewards. That sword plus the dress and amulet is OP. Totally negates armor. 
---
inside the house there should just be a quest maker pointing to it. 
---
I should of also mentioned, my method is all available for the right price... happy to share if you want it?
---
There are ways around that, but yeah.
---
I didn't realize the second screen was to fully load you in until someone said it
---
Tbh I thought that was just the game being a troll 
---
This is why we can't have anything nice -.-
---
Imagine your insecurity about dropping near $100 on a game and having to denounce those "hate train bandwagoners"
---
I remember those launch day posts, still at it months after launch.
---
Damn that sucks don't think I've had this happen before 
---
A PK is not a griefer.It's just a normal player who wants to kill you within game rules.
---
Q key for me (not messed with the bindings).
---
Agreed, but then again these events are really simple. Simple things shouldn't be rewarding. GW2 is basically full of public events that doesn't rewards you. They are fine, let them be there for people who are leveling up and doing quests. GW2 also got big events, what is basically equivalent SBQ. So, the way we got events in F76 are fine, what is problems is lack of raids/dungeons, team based content. Because of lack of endgame content, means we are now trying to compensate it with boring events and events aren't enough.
---
I love it, unless the mess it up, then they're dead to me
---
This. You can't get both. Mutually exclusive.
---
Go into the - resort -, go to the crafting shop place, BOOM STASH BOXES OMG, along with power armour stations, armour, weapons, chemistry, and food workstations :O 
---
Maybe set up a camp nearby? Like most players do?
---
I don't think you understand what a lootbox is supposed to contain, vs a lunchbox which has been a staple of the fallout universe already
---
How is this hard to comprehend?
---
Yeah, true, however crying about it, is also kinda sad.Just move on and take it like a man or hop if you don't want to riposte.
---
That's not griefing, that's completely fair
---
I ADORE Fallout. Thats why 76, its method and its development cycle has to die. If this is the quality of future Fallout titles then let this be the sacrafice needed to kick Bethesda to produce something of quality.
---
Okay, but I haven't picked up any plans there.
---
Has no one been to the Top Of The World yet? 
---
-Centrally located.
---
-Laid out in a circle, so that other players are visible(ish).
---
-Has pre-built fighting arena
---
-Basically a pre-war mall for rich skiers.
---
That or Valley Galleria. I like 76 as a place that you're not encouraged to spend lots of time in (you just lived there for 25 years!)
---
Dunno if anyone has suggested this or not, but the player hub should either be un-nukable, or you should get a 5000 Cap bounty for doing so. And it comes out of your caps. You should go into negative caps for doing that (which would disallow fast travel except to one's own camp and V76). Imagine the ENTIRE SERVER coming to collect that bounty!
---
You don't know his/her story. Might be an invalid that games all day to stay sane. Who knows.
---
So a note on this from when out-of-bounding in beta (properly reported and now patched so don't downvote lol). They are lvl 20-25 cargo bots, and do not drop cargo containers when shot down. No clue why they are there, and I observed them for a few minutes without seeing any leave.
---
Interesting..
---
them 2 mods should had never been on the same wep together like honest, they had to have tested them.TS on its own is fine TSE is a bit overboard.
---
How dare you, you'll be hearing from the Dog Food Defence Force about this....
---
Why should weapon types be balanced? They shouldn't and the IRL bullet types prove it.  
---
To make a .22LR do the same damage as a .50 is ridiculous. Bare fists, vs blunt, vs bladed, etc. aren't going to do the same type or amount of damage.  
---
Choices have consequences and to put this option in the game removes it. Nukes and Dragons is an awesome site and it accessible to everyone. It's been shared and posted almost every place Fallout is talked about. In this, there is not excuse for ignorance.  
---
How ranged weapons work with regard to the parts and ammo is done well but they have not done so with the damage ratio to enemies. That needs to be fixed.
---
If you're using blocking in an unintended way to get the drop on a target, it's leans heavily towards griefing. Not the literal definition of griefing but it certainly would feel like it.
---
She told me to eat her ass so I did
---
But not in the way she meant it
---
No shit. Who the hell plays a Fallout game expecting great pvp? They were trying to tap into the Fornite/Player unkown market into a game thats never been about pvp.
---
Exposotion does not equate into story. 
---
Players don't show on the map if they're sneaking.
---
Very.Banning the exploiters was a reward in itself, their tears flowing around this reddit, a bonus. Fixing these weapons, yeah, rewarding also.
---
Increase the camp budget, could care less about the noisy and useless turrets. I just want my place to look good and big, I can kill the shitey scorched beasts and super mutants my damn self!
---
Is the stack stored in your stash? If so, move one from your stash to your inventory. 
---
Be warned: you will "drop" the data and not in a brown bag if you server hop or re-log and will be unable to pick it up.
---
This might as well simply be UI glitch, but I think its worth investigating, hence I wanted to ask if I this has been observed elsewhere.
---
Everything I've read said plans spawn in Drop Site C2?
---
(PC Player) What is this messaging you speak of??
---
you are tired of seeing it because you paid 100 bucks for a bad game and don't like to feel like you could have made a mistake so you have to go online and tell everyone how much you spent and how good an idea it was. 
---
Balanced doesn't mean every weapon does the same amount of damage per shot, you know.  I'm more referring to the fact that there are entire categories of weapons that are utterly useless right now.
---
I don't know why you are being so rude, judging by the 12 inbox messages I have from others perhaps you should not be so selfish.
---
I think Bethesda should be lurking on this thread.  
---
Consider sending them this thread just in case they miss it please.  
---
These are some very interesting ideas!
---
👍
---
Remember that blocking works both ways, they can't see your map location either. Anything that adds an element of danger to an already quite tame world, is good. Being careless with the environment and not looking over your shoulder should have a risk associated. Lock doors, be careful ,conceal your position, move around, use stealth, stuff is coming to kill you.
---
I'm on ps4 but yes about 75% of the time I try to go into watoga, whitesprings, or a queen fight I crash.  Reported it to bethesda and they told me it was a problem with my playstation.  Reported it to Sony and completed their troubleshooting.  They say its Bethesda issue and knownbethesda wont talk to me.
---
That's a great idea. In DC Universe Online, that's exactly what they did. There were bases that a group could use, with the watchtower also available for the whole server.
---
I could be confused. The flooded one usually has a magazine for me. There's a locked container in the back that can definitely spawn plans. I can't remember if I picked up a plan from a table or surface there.
---
The other one has a metal table in the back that has a plan. It can be kind of hard to see because it sometimes spawns on the bottom shelf.
---
I am having the same type issue since the update, I spawn, and it takes about 15 seconds to spawn water and some background, and then within 10 to 20 seconds I get disconnected.
---
No, instead of giving karma to player, it should be rather based on how much you kill wanted players or how much you are Wanted player. And there should be two faction shops, good and evil, with theme items. Wanted players are only thing right now that bring atleast some flavor into this game and what this game needs is more flavor. 
---
Nerf TSE but ignore the 5k melee builds cause "balance". 'Kay... All this does is punish ranged users, automatics are back to being pointless again.
---
I like the location of my CAMP - it's near Whitespring junk pile, so I have a junk deposit, Lewisburg+Whitespring+Bunker+R&amp;G vendors nearby, Whitesprings Nuke Zone is near and the bots also help sometimes.
---
P.S. Only way to avoid enemies attacking CAMP is to build it in a unreachable location, because it's an "event".
---
There's never a bag time for Wagner. Wish they would add Tchaikovsky's 1st piano concerto, and Beethoven's 5th?/7th?/ode?
---
Yeah buddy it's got to do with armour mods. For me it was my sensor array mod on my excavator armour helmet. Apparently the recon mod can cause it and a few other regular armour mods.
---
I know, i wish i could edit the title.
---
Just have two different types of characters for each game type. Allows for balance between PvE servers and PvP servers.
---
WOW. You’ve done all that can be resonably expected and this is how they treat you? This game is over for us then until some future patch that may fix this. 
---
If that's going to be the case, many people wouldn't even try it.
---
What's wrong with Whitespring?
---
if the server is struggling but not completely disconnecting it would be the exploit i used during the beta (and sometimes in the full game) which allowed me to place my camp inside of train stations or marked locations. it can be used for duping if you really wanted to but it would kill the framerate for anyone within that whole part of the map.
---
Thank for the precision
---
You're selling exploited / duped items for real money. 
---
Hey please don't nerf TSE just depower them in pvp. TSE weapons are literally the only weapons that single players can use to kill the queen without the bloodied perk and basically nerfing would just make the schorched beasts impossible to kill without teammates.
---
My X-01 is fully modded. I’ll give it a try in PA with no mods. Thanks for the tip. 
---
Top of the World is a ruined shithole. No thanks.
---
Although I'm glad we could have a mature conversation I'm afraid we'll have to end it before you get too cranky 
---
Those are not griefers. This is exactly what is wrong with F76 playerbase. Every PVP action is labeled into griefing. PVP is not griefing. Griefing is when I kill you, you go away. I search you and kill you again. Then you go again away and I search you again and kill you. Griefing is like not allowing other player standup in fighting game or killing player right when they spawn. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/agixv2/ps4_watoga_weird_for_me_today_locks_and_reset_bots/
---
I just wait now. If you check the map you'll see your carry weight at the bottom right. Just wait until that looks right and everything should be loaded in (I think).
---
That's what I do, anyway. Otherwise there's a chance to lock up or not be able to move. Happens mostly at Watoga for me, but has also happened at my CAMP in Savage Divide.
---
I'd prefer higher "tiers" of enemies with new mechanics etc rather than the same ones scaling up. I enjoy challenging games, when a game stops being challenging (and/or new to me) I get bored pretty damn fast.
---
Well  if  you own a workshop better be prepared for a fight.  When u claim a workshop its like saying 'come and kill me' 
---
Maybe you did 19 hours ago. Plans dont respawn just because you skip it, many times they dont spawn at all.
---
But even 4 missile launchers won't deal with a Scorchbeast on their own.
---
Seeing as we are apparently asking for things we don't like to be removed, can we have rifles and melee weapons removed from the pools too? I only want heavy weapons, thanks.
---
Unless you're dropping (and not deploying) your PA you have nothing to worry about.
---
Doubling weapon damage is an insanely unbalanced affix. I say this as someone with a TSE gun. I’m glad they are needing both.
---
Na, I have killed the queen with a small group and no one using two shot explosive. Even so, explosive two shot is still going to be a decent damage boost and may continue to be the most sought after legendary for most guns anyway. People are just pissy about having to shoot a couple times to kill something instead of once again.
---
It was clear the nerf would come. This is a reasonable nerf, that puts the TS and E guns into more reasonable perspective compared to other weapons. Now they should nerf the bobbleheads (same type non stacking) and then i am happy. 
---
#Bonus points if they make the soccer field functional. 
---
Hey no problem. 
---
Check to see if you're using the helmet mod that highlights living targets and if you do, you'll have to mod it off or make a new one. I had to make a new helmet but since then I haven't had a bluescreen. 
---
Bloodied is +50-75% dmg at critical health, two shot means it shoots two times which means +100% dmg and the explosives also trigger twice so no, it's nowhere near as good as TSE. 
---
If you hate it so much then why do you post in the sub?
---
By visibly struggled I meant waiting 30 seconds until loot appears. The game was playable otherwise and I had no particular need to switch servers afterwards. 
---
Oh god I just have to have my camp on the top of the top of the world.
---
Is that what that means?  I thought it was humping.
---
Where is this?
---
They don't have the money to rebuild that man.
---
It's a rare drop item. As others have said, if I'm going to spend weeks grinding for something it better be worth it. It's even harder finding one you're spec'd into. Regular guns do complete trash damage, bland if you feel you dont like TSE's and prefer guns that do no damage then you're free to not use them!
---
I wish i could edit the title since i know now the difference between these griefer and PK.
---
Not sure if anyone else experienced  it but occasionally I'll get stuff stuck in a logic loop where both items think they are supporting the other one. The only fix is to move camp.
---
I disagree. Nothing annoys me more than a game showing a loading screen if it could be showing the loading process live instead.
---
The missile targeting system plan is an event reward only so far 
---
TSE is just a meme, I'll bet 90% of the time it's just a regular explosive shotgun. The term is thrown around so much while people have no clue what they're talking about, that's the abomination.
---
come on bro yea I can melee but most enemies over 50 are bullet sponges, lets not be delusional. My best shotgun which is only two shot is now 75% weaker and already took 3-4 shots to kill super mutants above 50. I have max shot gunner and rifleman. This game is mostly PVE. There are ways around this ohter than making people who dont even PVP suffer. 
---
if it fixes itself after a bit it could just be servers doing server things. i have had to wait a few times for my camp to load in piece by piece.
---
Not really viable but I'd hold onto it a few weeks to sell it once player vending is in. You can probably get a thousand caps or so.
---
I'm going to test it on Xbox in a minute, since I don't have a PS4. If it's console related it might/should crash for me as well. 
---
I'll keep you posted. 
---
And as we rebuild towns, some npcs begin inhabiting it: they would defend the town and stuff, and a few would give you minor quests, but most of them they would just show gratitude for making location X safe to live. I mean, what’s a town without people?
---
because the problem could be handled in other ways that dont affect PVE players. 
---
A ton of people also use the Text Chat mod for PC. It is a life saver (I haven't been banned yet so I don't think they are going after people using mods. Just cheating third party apps). There is both global chat and trade chat. I tend to turn global chat off though since it can be pretty hectic during prime hours
---
You may have misunderstood me I’m looking for another hand made so I can have one prime and one not
---
I have a FULL sentinel Assassin set and most people have no idea how this set really works. It says while standing and not moving you get the bonus. When it says not moving that means not moving at all. No turning, no looking around and aiming, no shooting back. When you get shot you flinch that counts as moving. So consecutive shots will do dmg easily. This has all been testing because i have a set and its not really that great.
---
Well **even if** Bethesda actually wanted it to be a player hub it obviously didn't fucking work.   That doesn't mean we should shit on other people's ideas does it you pathetic fuck?
---
The original post indicates that this is only relevant for exiting the power armor that is currently being used. The advice on how to correctly place PA is a good one, and the rumour of disappearing PAs was going out since BETA, I agree that most of these were people dropping their PA sets. Hell, I even lost one and I remember how I exit the server seeing that armor on the ground and thinking its my friends who was crafting nearby, so I can relate, I did lost a PA by dropping it once and its definitely a missclick on my part.
---
This is different. This is a PA set that you can enter, but cannot collect, that is like this AFTER you exit it.
---
Asinine comments are asinine, ya know?
---
Melee is fine pve .. TSE is not. Melee has risk/reward .. TSE does not.
---
Other weapons are equally as viable. It's not my problem you want to 1 shot things. I a auto pistol users have NO ISSUE in this game with or without melee players around. I can still kill mobs before they can run to them. I don't even need the handicap of an explosive weapon either, neat huh?
---
I disagree. 80% damage nerf is asinine. I do however think that TSE + PvP damage should be nerfed. I didn't grind for 3 weeks to find a gun that was in perspective to regular guns
---
So, you're all for nerfing melee cause of the 5k damage builds?
---
What was the weapon dmg of the pistol?
---
Yeah it is op. Two shot is one of the best mods since fo4. Explosive aswell.
---
It seems wrong to nerf them so badly. 
---
Sure, cause it gave you damage boosts in other games huh? In fallout shelter lunchboxes ARE lootboxes. Also, they will contain random effects which you won't see from the shop (at their current state), so you are essentially gambling the same way when you buy lootboxes. 
---
Pretty sure the in game explanation (can't remember exactly when it says this..) for this is that Vault Tec deliberately set the vault to shut down all those life support functions on Reclamation Day in order to force the inhabitants out into the world and so they wouldn't just remain in the vault indefinitely.
---
So, nerf guns, but let melee have their 5k damage swings
---
The same advice stands.
---
Recall to inventory is automatic at the end of a timer, logout, etc.
---
Unless you're dropping your PA you have nothing to worry about.
---
Why all the downvotes? I find it perfectly reasonable...
---
My camp has 0 turrets and shitloads of letters and power consuits. It ALWAYS loads for two minutes, piece by piece, on my I7 8700K :o
---
Their damages is so pitiful. That’s the issue. Balancing weapon damage is easier than enemy resistances. 
---
As a TSE user, good.
---
I usually drop Mods, unwanted ammo, weapons junk and plan's in containers around the train station, after drain the vendor. I  seem to like either lunchbox, green suitcase. all so drop stuff in the metal box at the enclave trader console, but personally I have never found anything  left by others. I hope it helps out any folks wandering 
---
&gt; because people don't want to get killed in one shot in PvP
---
Melee gets overlooked for some reason though.
---
Both are being nerfed.
---
not really at the moment but im trying to get back into it, im pretty pissed about the nerfs
---
I don’t think anybody pre level 15 is going to need a hub, I only started using vendors after level 30, they’re inaccessible until then. 
---
And the quest is meant to be just before 15, since after you get full Raider PA. 
---
The damage to enemy ratio is F'd.  
---
From what I know and have learned they are keeping it this way to keep you playing it. There's little incentive to restart a char since you'd have to do all the quests over again OR have a group take that char to nuked areas to power level it up and then worry about doing quests if they are even interested.  
---
Complain all day but if people start to get to end-game content too fast they'll quit playing until new content comes out. Even then, if it's not good or they're not interested same effect.
---
Lol right. It’s been much more. 1.5 k caps is a joke. Grind and find one yourself scrub
---
While they're still fixing the game and supposedly listening I do think so. There's way too many specific issues to talk about that deserve to be discussed openly  in as many threads as are needed to fix issues. 
---
Just regular bitching and moaning yeah but there's... Just..so.. much to fix and every time there is an update there are a lot if broken things. After the games been out for a while maybe but there's a lot of issues that need visibility. But that's just imo 
---
Until I manage to reproduce it in controlled environment, and get confirmation that nobody can snatch it, I'm gonna keep entering it ASAP as I see the collect button is missing, because better safe than sorry.
---
And you're telling me that the Deathclaws, Glowing and Charred Ghouls wouldn't spawn if there was no high level players in the area. 
---
Because I refuse to believe that.
---
It’s post apocalypticia, what did you expect?
---
The problem is it already has a lot of quests built around it. It would need some exclusive area that is free of enemies and a safe warp zone like Fault 76 and Whitespring have.
---
Whitespring works great as a player hub (especially if it had a free warp) but it runs like shit because of all the robots and constant nuking/farming.
---
I dunno man, I have gone there around level 10 on a couple characters now with no real problems. Prior to that level, it is not like I had much use for player trade anyways.
---
Just eat dog food. It's neither. And both. 
---
You are in the minority though. I am with you, I enjoy it despite all its flaws. The YouTuber circle jerk is a little much but a lot of the flak they got was deserved. They made a lot of missteps and clearly didn’t test the game even remotely enough. You and I and a lot of others are willing to go through the improvement experience with the Devs. But you can’t blame the vast majority for being put off by the embarrassing state of the game on release. 
---
This is a separate issue.
---
My blue screen issues are much better: not one since the patch. 
---
and that technically has a perk that boosts all foods effectiveness
---
Dude, any raider boss with a brain cell puts one guy on radar duty. Usually a group of 4 will have their 4th at their personal camp sneaking and map watching while the other 3 wreak havoc. 
---
I'm listening...
---
There's already a perk called vaccinated, NEXT!
---
That's what they are, not what they're for ;)
---
I haven't been 1-shotted in pacifist but I did have a gamma gun melt me disturbingly quickly.
---
To not be constantly saturated in it. I love the Whitespring because it provides a break from the constant barrage of 'everything is fucked'.
---
No, it cannot. I'd know.
---
which is freddy wood storyline?
---
Yup. I was all for nerfing melee way back before TSEs reproduced like rabbits.
---
I would LOVE to swap one for the other. I wanna grow my own food but I don't feel like farming mutations again
---
Plus the veggie soup allow for simultaneous food and water Regen 
---
The exp nerf SUCKS when starting a new character. More so in comparison to when the game launched and you could level as quickly as the quest leads you around the map {This is not possible anymore, you DO need to grind it out somewhere before moving on. I'm also not talking about whitesprings nuke zone cheese.}. So the exp acpect at early levels now sucks, those past 50 exp does not seem to be a issue as you level pretty fast beyond that.
---
Rewards .. meeeeeeh. They've never been good save for a few like the sommerset pistol {Armor piecing pistol} or the all rise {90% weight reduction}. As from legendary mobs? No, not really but then again. They've always been disappointing. I've gotten rolling pins for days but only a handful of guns and a bunch of wooden armor.
---
Just my two cents.
---
Could help save on what perks to use and allow use for more
---
Yet you expect someone else to do it?
---
So you bought a TSE and is here to cry nice.
---
Fully understand that, 76 is the most broken game I've ever played. I haven't been able to play for longer than 15-20 minutes since December 10th patch. Constant crashes on base PS4. I guess the ranting and raving section is good in Warframe as it actually works 97% of the time. 76 just needs to be completely rebuilt from the ground up. 
---
Actually i have couple tse guns and i have got them with 1,5k caps and i have tse pump too but im buying another one that i can give to my son... 
---
You do whatever makes you feel better. ;)
---
I usually play on a team and we've tried all the "power armor snatching" rumors we've seen and have never been able to do it.
---
Since you're nervous, also be aware of the "ghost chassis" that appears sometimes when players fast travel. You can't interact with it and the inventory menu will just spin. Don't worry - that's not yours. It's just a glitch.
---
Ultimately I just stopped opening it right away.    When I opened it and it was blank, I would freeze up.  I tried to wait it out to see if it would load but the game was just frozen.  I waited over a minute and could not do anything other than pull up the map.  Could not move, could not put the pipboy down etc.   
---
Well atleast i dont need to worry about getting a TSE weapon lol .... 25% dmg increase by TWO shoot, this makes no sense.
---
And ofcurse its in like every other game where there is PvP, PvE player will suffer from stupid PvP's and Dupers again ....
---
Yeah that's totally what I said...
---
If there’s a companion app, there would need to be a way to view our stash: so that way trades and crap would be done easier
---
Reason is you are usually running low health so you are in danger of getting taken out by someone flicking your nose. 
---
Well, I have bad news here.
---
There is no "loot pool," exactly. There is a leveled list. The higher your level, the more things get added to the end of the list.
---
But the garbage from the beginning is still on the list, because it's one single master list. Each entry is like a ticket in the lottery; a level 10 has all their tickets on low-level shite. A level 120 has lots of tickets spread out over good stuff, great stuff, bad stuff, one or two amazing possibilities, and a ton of absolute garbage from the bottom of the list which is still there and still has its tickets available.
---
It's almost like this entire engine wasn't really designed for an online multiplayer MMO-ish experience!
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted. I guess people downvote opinions rather than shit content now.
---
You made a statement and then adressed the silver lining, how fucking dare you. /s
---
yes I understand there are weapons in game with an explosive legendary effect however there is also heat seeking attachments. honestly I don't think the first is actually too OP. I think bethesda realizes this nerf will act as damage control for those who don't enjoy playing with cheaters. 
---
Patches might stop a duper from duping but does it any way negate the profits they've already made.
---
 If you are a cheater you shouldn't have to write a letter of apology to Bethesda you should have to write it to the community, or both.
---
again I've personally hesitated to join the conversation happening, or at all going out of my way to engage in the community because of how much easier it is to not spoil my own fun. But again I don't think I'm unique in the way I personally play, and again as long as you actually engage with cheaters in a way that they cant manipulate the PVP mechanics in their favor (which may be easier said than done) it is possible to kill them.
---
that's obviously not the only way to kill them. Maybe there are tons of even more ways I personally haven't thought but others have. In that regard especially since these nerfs actually effect all applications of these types of weapons and actually just more of single shot, high damage, low fire rate. I think it definitely has more change in the economy of the game and not pvping.
---
to the person, who questioned my comprehension: was I unclear, or illegible, or were you just like speed answering. I ask because I don't reddit very much and possibly need some reflecting over the process of this shiet. example: I swear a bunch. is that a bad thing ?
---
No. You will get a 1-star Tire Iron and like it.
---
I know I sure do....
---
Yes, I am using that mod. Thanks for the advice I’ll give it a try. 
---
 "I -would- have over 850 hours on the game, 
---
 but the server disconnected. "
---
Sounds like a problem with your knee.
---
Lol, bra, for real? My heavy weapons dude can take on everything in this game with no legendary weapons and holds his own in the queen fight while carry alittle extra. What in this is so monsterous that you are struggling as a heavy user, and one with a legendary gun at that? 
---
If you are just referring to tougher fights like mirelurk and scorch beast queens, are you saying that any fight that makes you work alittle for it is a problem? If your saying TSE weapons will be useless post patch, let me point out that they will still be a damage boost from standard weapons and as a level 120+ with standard weapons, I havent faced anything in this game that made me feel like I had to reroll melee since level 50 onward. I am epicly confused by your post brother.
---
Even if during that process you are vulnerable to taking damage but not able to defend yourself? 
---
There is currently a glitch with Excavator armor. If you log in while wearing it, you get +200 carryweight boost instead of the +100 is should give. Once you exit the PA or unequip some parts, the carryweight is fixed. Note that if you have Calibrated Shocks on legs, those don't double. Ideally, you'd get +300 after logging in, which is nice if you don't plan to exit while in the session (or you get naturally disconnected).
---
I would love to see things that make a difference. Starting up the power stations sends power to places that you can build your camp at and workshops. It makes a difference at the workshops. I like others got the most useful generator really early in the game. Before I knew that you could post up next to a power station and siphon power from that.
---
When feed the people gave everyone in the server canned food. We where literally feeding the people. We where making the world a better place.
---
I'd like to see the rebuilding of the railroad tracks. A event that when you get near the track allows you and your group to walk the track line and rebuild it at cost. Heavy in resources (steel) but allows anyone to fast travel for free connected stations. Or, and I don't know if this is technologically possible, to have a ride-able train car that can have defense events get to your stop in stead of fast travel.
---
There are two places that should be central hubs, the second floor of the Top of the World, and the shop floor of the Whitespring Resort. Top of the World would be a perfect communal area, but I regularly see people grouping and chatting in the whitesprings resort shops. They crowd around the artisans corner to craft and sell stuff. Either please would be a perfect community area as they’re both very central places, that most people reach pretty quickly when the start the game.
---
Instigating for PvE and 40% swing speed for big stuff. I personally hate power armor, it's good at low levels but you should really try and get a good set of regular armor as it's much more enjoyable IMO. Power armor sets your strength to, 7 so once you have 7 or more strength, it doesn't do much. Save it for nuke zones.
---
It becomes less of a concern later on when you have ammosmith and super duper helping to increase your ammo crafting abilities. I have about 700-1000 rounds on me most of the time. Once you get some decent legendary mods or a good VATS build with better crits, they become pretty good. 
---
I don't think the 2 shot and explosive effect don't need to be nerfed for the same reason as why thee bee doesn't need a nerf. It's fun as hell.
---
okay maybe nerfed against players but not against npcs
---
2 shot is a constant damage bonus, in contrast the various slayer effects; zealot's, hunter's, exterminator's, ect.
---
Those situational effect only provide a 30% bonus, so a slightly lower damage bonus that always applies seems like a fair trade.
---
What I said might be hard to comprehend, because it's referencing Zenimax's Terms of Service, but most negative or controversial comments get downvotes pretty easy. Unless it's reflecting collective dislike or repulsion.
---
People just complaining and saying they're done with the game for good need to go. It's like... Ya me 2 bro but if I had something else to do itd be doing it 
---
Plus generalized complaints are gonna fix anything and rants about core design changes (human NPCs) aren't doing anything and are getting old from the 90 percent of the people who never actually played the game. 
---
I leave plans ammo etc everyday in the suitcase at Watoga station or in the lunch box at Grafton station. When I am ready to log out at the end of play I return and take whatever is left so they don't get lost after I logout. Then next time I am on I put them back in. That is unless I get a server crash then it all disappears but personally since the latest update (PS4) I have only had 1 crash. So always check the containers at stations is the moral of the story 👍
---
Apologies mate, I think you were clear, but I was at work and rushed, and couldnt muster much outside of a clarification of the discussion. I erroniously thought you were referring to explosive weapons themselves and not the legendary effects. When I get time, ill go back and re-read what you wrote properly and give a proper response.
---
So how do bloodied builds do a few thousand damage?
---
[https://www.newegg.com/](https://www.newegg.com/)
---
I agree with most of these, ESPECIALLY BULK AMMO, I have much more of what I don't need than the ammo types I primarily use but don't feel like dropping it all the time (heavy gunner here, so I use .50 cal and 5mm above all else)
---
Lolz you realize by the time you’re tall and strong enough to go to white spring, you could’ve just done miner miracles?
---
At the moment that would just be filled with "NERFING TWO-SHOT IS WITCH HUNTING WTB: TSE, 500 CAPS".
---
Also, it seems you have a kind of terrible outlook on the game so why does it matter to you?
---
Actually the Two Shot bonus as I remember it from FO4 on Combat rifles was you would get your first bullet with normal buffed up damage from rifle mods etc (say 150 with mods, 50 base damage), and the second shot was never ever for 150 again but the base damage so instead of 150 + 150 it would be 150 + 50.
---
This doesn't seem that far a nerf from that type of calculation to me.
---
Have a friend load into the zone before you, they don't loot but you do.   Repeat with server hops, have them join a new server then you join after they've loaded in.  When you're done, split the plunders with your buddy.  The timer only counts towards who picks up the loot, not who spawned it.
---
True. But when your a heavy weapons build melee weapons deal more dmg is kinda BS. The heavy weapons bases need a bump still, using a Minigun should be devastating. But all it is without those effect is a waste of ammo. 
---
I got them to snap perfectly, what you do is get it to the point where it snaps, then move ever so slightly until it unsnaps, then slightly back towards it and just before it snaps, place it. It will look like it's not snapping, but when you let go, it will go right where you want it to. It's a pain, but *it just works.*
---
This is actually a really interesting idea, it would make the game challenging again, even for the higher levelled players
---
-Edit- Downvotes and....nothing to say, huh ?
---
&gt; **locked for anyone but thr player who requested**  
---
Not exactly in my experience. I ordered several myself and they were locked for me as well. In addition, sometimes opening them up in sight of neutral robots will make them attack you.
---
So you run a melee build and panic whenever someone mentions melee needing to be nerfed.
---
Pretty much sll games get some kind of nerfing. 
---
It will give you a reason to grind again.
---
Well idk, they could just make the mobs have mil's of hp so we cant 1shot them, but then every player  will be forced to use a TSE, as  of now it looks really hard to balance them around pve.
---
Reposts here are the worst. There’s not even a tired meme. Just the same 10 suggestions rephrased a thousand ways every day.
---
Awh man, I just picked up my third helmet plan last night and dropped it on the floor in the Watoga train station lmao. I wish I saw this sooner. 
---

PROBLEM SOLVED
---
NEXT QUESTION
---
We all discussed this a billion times here for the last 2-3 weeks, good grief
---
I am one of those people who is done with the game, but I have good reason to be.I can't actually play the game since the updates.. That's why I lurk this forum in hopes of an actual fix. But yeah people are salty and upset and they feel burned by Bethesda.. That's why people do need a safe controlled place to vent their frustrations. It's a shame one of my favorite franchises is treating me this way. 
---
Very much so but it's also likely that they will fuck up something at some point, not listening community, going different route, doing too much changes just like what happened to h1z1 for example
---
They are walking on a thin plank but if they keep steady walking they will succeed. One slip can have huge effects for the games future and player base
---
What good is a player hub without a text chat ?
---
I don't use a mic so trying to convey what I want to sell/buy/trade/quest is impossible with the 5 emotes I have.
---
Thanks for sharing, very interesting to know!
---
I do see where you are coming from with that and I agree but with TS being rarer it would make sense to make it 40 or 50% buff. Taking it down to 25 just seems a little overkill. 
---
PSA: It's possible and totally fine to enjoy bad games.
---
They are also changing Explosive. They went back and clarified. TS will be reduced to just +25%, and Explosive will be lowered to just +20 or 25%, I forget. 
---
I had an invisible enemy earlier. I think it's because of other players around you spawning things in which are not phased in for you. Definitely a bug, but also doesn't happen nearly as much as it did a month ago. Just got to play the lay.
---
I play on the xbox version of 76, when you open your map you can put your cursor over the player and either send a direct message or invite to group etc.
---
My Outlook is terrible because after 300 hours of grinding and finally getting my jetpack and calibrated shocks and a legit TSE.. The last updates rendered my character playable in 15-20 minute bursts. So yes I am salty I can't play my game without issue. 
---
Location?
---
Damn! Thanks for the info. Might need to find a friend to farm some plastic with this weekend 😂 
---
Nah, I'm pretty sure the keypad in Tanagra Town has nothing to do with the safe. I read on a different post (can't find it now, sorry) that someone managed to glitch in the room behind that keypad and there was nothing of interest.
---
It's still in the top affixes for most of the guns. +25% flat damage increase is pretty good.
---
It’s called ecological balance I believe. Between Lakeside cabins and Charleston is a water treatment plant. You’ll get a misc obj to investigate a trailer. No spoilers, but you’ll unlock a terminal and get an obj to collect 3 holotapes. Water, soil, air. It’ll pop up markers at different locations around the map. You get the holotapes and bring them back.
---
I think the better solution would be just that we are able to remove cards. If we were able to trade cards levelling up would become more or less pointless. And without a goal i'm not sure the game stays fun in the long term.
---
I do not understand why people are crying about this.
---
The gun will still be OP. Just slightly less OP.
---
And congratulations! A month from now you will have a rare, exclusive item that people just starting to play the game would probably buy for insane prices.
---
I already bought one (by accident), so now I have to wait till I get 1400 since the Starlet Sniper looks like a pirate outfit
---
It's easy enough to judge.  What other prefix competes with it you would want instead?  Remember explosive does not compete for the same slot.
---
I also play on a PS4 standard. I don't crash as often and it seems they fixed the workbench/stash box crashes I was having.
---
What happens in 15-20 minutes? Are you loading into Watoga and locking up, by chance?
---
Harder to get a legendary prefix on a gun you want compared to the melee mutations...
---
I Just went through that building my first time last night. if it wasn't for my explosive shotgun i'd have been toast.
---
So calling it two shot is pointless. Because the whole point is it firing two bullets at a time, which means double the damage. And now it won’t be. Which is stupid. Change the name of the effect if your going to take the effect away. 
---
Oh, and as long as we're having a SBQ etiquette thread: How do I let people know I'm an Empath and they should invite me to their team, without a microphone? Is there a standard emote for that, or something?
---
It would be good if there was a'bar' area where you could pick up quest buddies etc 
---
Oh man, still? It was like that in FO4 and it seemed like a design oversight. Should be able to have your unarmed weapon override the mod (Tesla, hydraulic, etc) for your right power armour piece and have it that way. I mean, why not? We gotta wait for external modders to sort this basic thing out _again_ ?
---
Exactly, I'm talking about the game because I actually do love it despite it's flaws. That being said I'm going to point some things out that are just not working and lessening my experience
---
Fuck your son 
---
This. This is the best option.
---
I have two characters arrange build with a TSE and a melee build the melee build does more overall. Hell my range build actually does better with instigating and anti-armor. 
---
Those are the top three build currently for pushing DPS. So nerfing one just leaves the other two I really feel bad for the people who just have that one.
---
Nope, never did. Just saw some plans and they kind of blend in with ambient garbage, so maybe I've just bern missing them.
---
I had a Two-shot LMG once, it was practically useless. I've tried it in the Guided Meditation event where the adds come in a nice straight line, making them an easy target. I chewed through 2000 rounds in minutes and failed the event. I was looking at the reloading animation more than at the firing.
---
(Now the same event with a plain explosive .50 Cal, I can solo the event and defend all 4 shrines with only 350 rounds total.)
---
True. I wish they would've just kept explosive resistance separate like they did in Fallout New Vegas and Tactics http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Hit_the_Deck
---
They can already do that though. Warping to the v76 entrance is free. Making it so you can go inside won't really encourage more people to stand outside imo.
---
I totally agree with your view. I call them the lazy gamers. The ones that just want to button mash and kill everything with one shot. 
---
These are the players that spend all their time at Whitesprings grinding for legendaries and XP, then complain about the game. The players who read about the best weapon and armor, and then grind to get that, then complain there's nothing to do.
---
I got in a discussing with some the other day who wanted an easier way to transfer items between their own alternate characters. 
---
It was so clear why. They wanted a way to bypass the stash limit by having lots and lots of mules. I said I was tired of seeing lowbie characters with stuff they shouldn't have, to trick them. Because since stuff is based on level, you can't have a level 5 with a tesla rifle. They took the bait. So I said, I know, what you are really trying to do is get around the stash limit. 
---
They insisted they weren't and even if they were, so what it's already super easy to do so with an alt, all you need was a trusted friend. Great I said! If it's already super easy, they don't need to waste time developing code so you can do that! That's when I started really getting called names.
---
I like that the game broke the hoarder mentality for me in this game. I like that the game makes me think about how my character is going to develop, in terms of perks.
---
I think the perk system works fine, when you view it from grouping. Most of the people that want changes like making lock picking and hacking passive, always seem to turn out to be solo players. They don't like having to swap out perk. 
---
If you didn't solo a game whose first design consideration is for grouping all the time, and maybe grouped up, you'd see the value of the perk system. By sharing perks, you don't have to keep swapping out cards, and you end up with...MORE PERKS! 
---
These are also the same people that min/max their SPECIAL's. One guy was telling me there's never any reason to have Intelligence past five. Hmmm...is that because Makeshift Weapon has a max rank of five, and it helps you slow the rate your melee weapons break?  
---
They complain about having to spend so much time server hopping for plans and mods, that they never realize that they will get that stuff if they just play the *whole* game. You just know if you looked at their in game maps, they would all probably be very similar. Large areas that have never been explored. 
---
They cry about how many springs, gears and screws they need. But they never ever learn how to look for stuff outside of 2-3 places. The game is so huge and the junk is so well placed in this world, that you can figure out many different spots to go to find what you need. I mean seriously, once you know what junk gives what, or us the tag feature, getting what you need is very easy. 
---
Which is what I think is driving so many posts about changes to the game. Solo players always trying to make the game more like a single player game. They call it quality of life, but it's really just being lazy.
---
They don't want to have to think. They want the game to do all the thinking, so they can be uber, kill everything with one shot, or two if it's really tough.
---
It's how they want to play. But to me it sounds so boring and terrible. And I can't see them really enjoying it, because all they do is complain about the game. 
---
Why are u so toxic? 😀 
---
No because then pvp is still garbage the fact you have to do that slap damage at all is dumb should be a duel invite similar to trade invite which after accepting you get a short timer then fight easy 
---
Yup people that spent literally months grinding for a weapon are getting completely screwed so a practically non existent area of the game can still be un balanced. Guess they are going to change the game to fortnite 76 and screw the entire pve community. I will likely quit this game over all the lost hours farming my now useless handmade. If anything make it so you hit for 10-20% damage in PvP. People will still be getting one shot it will just be a junkie/bloody/mele build doing it now.

The only way to get it go be worth going to PvP world's Is better loot drops but then pve players will cry fowl.
---
I've got 600 hours and three main characters, one of them is specifically for trolling people, she has 3 two-shot fatmans with demo expert and wrecking ball, only carries orbital strike beacons with the last laugh perk. The best part is, she has no caps on her so you can't even claim a bounty after I've annihilated your base.    
---
You've got to find your own fun in this game, devs aren't going to fix it nearly fast enough to keep up with the shit-heads. What you're asking for would be a booring farmville style snooze fest game. Listen, I don't like what they've done to you, but there's got to be something out there to inspire you to adapt and overcome, otherwise what will y ou do, build your base and water your flowers til the end of time? 
---
Two shot is not that much better than other attributes/weapons and for me it makes the end game feel more balanced and less of a grind, plus I dont have to use melee constantly. All this is basically your opinion which is fine, but in my opinion they shouldn't nerf anything. I mean come on people barley even pvp. Ive played over 200 hrs and not one person has attacked me. If they want to nerf stuff for PVP they should make separate servers with load outs that are locked to certain weapons. This is mainly a pve game and nerfing shit is making more people not want to play.
---
Aside from the Veil of Mysteries, the Marine Mask is the only non PA "Helmet" that protects you from disease in Ash Heap and Toxic Valley without doing -2 PER
---
You need a TSE MG42 to make it even worth using. And even still it guzzles ammo while crafting gives you a paltry amount compared to 5mm and .50 types.
---
They should call the perk fragged, so when the bullets hit the enemy it does an extra 20% more damage
---
Well it's really strange. It all started at the Dec 4th patch when I found myself in a blue screen error code loop at my base. After about 4 hours of trying things I finally managed to figure out fast traveling away from my camp would stop the crash. So I did that and moved my base and that worked until Dec 10th update. Now I'll just be randomly walking or talking to a vendor or even just looking through my inventory and I'll randomly crash to home screen. I've even had a crash that completely deleted the game. I think my character data might be broken.. Possibly a memory leak. But without fail I crash within 15 - 20 minutes. It's also not the ps4 failing. As I play monster Hunter World much more than 76..I have currently 600 hours and I've never had a crash. Never on any other game except 76
---
Nope... Didn't say that. Should be nerfed aswell.
---
They are making a pvp mode.  That's really all we know right now.  They talk about it in this week's "Inside the Vault".
---
It's really the problem that you don't have a lot of defense or pvp gear compared to a lot of the people who go after PVP. I mean look at your health it's probably what 250 to 300 the gun says it does about 190 - 300 that's your entire Health pool right there. Oh and fireproof and dense Body Mod on your torso  and you're pretty much explosion-proof to begin with. 
---
Yeah Dr per shot really helps, but not as much as 8% on five pieces of armor making 40% damage reduction in PvP plus the actual damage reduction of the armor and any endurance perks. Not to mention some drugs are flat-out percentage increase.
---
As if they wouldn't have one-shot you anyways..
---
Max ammosmith+max super duper+chemist=insane amounts of ammo. The only road block for me is having enough acid. I dumped 4,000 rounds of 5.56  on a lower level friend because I had over 10,000.
---
Also, it does duplicate weapons and armor. I crafted a handmade for a friend last night and it gave me one for him and another to scrap. Then I made him a full set of marine armor and had  2 duplicate pieces I scrapped.
---
The effects will still roll, they changed the original article to state thst
---
I love this idea! 
---
The only reasons I've seen hate towards tse is griefing others while in pacifist mode due to the slap damage mechanic and people who run melee builds that want to pvp.  Let's face it pacifist mode is junk and will continue because the hackers and dupers are still going to destroy you with all the bubble heads and the next thing people are going go cry nerf at are the op melee builds.  It's an endless cycle when you start nerfing things that people cry about when in fact they could just take a step back and look to see how to make other or new legendary perks better.
---
Yup I was gutted when I read about it. Makes me not want to play. Currently im trying to be butt hurt because I dont know what else to play lol. Going to give Ghost Recon another go I think.
---
Have you tried hitting something with a normal weapon lately? They are bullet sponges. Iv yet to get a decent Shotgun and unless your in mele range making headshots it take 10-14 shots to kill a normal super mutant. I guess the value on Stimpaks just went through the roof.
---
I think pvp has to be truly at least notably balanced first. They have to make stuff like camp defenses powerful enough to be able to beat alot of players
---
I think they just cut off water, heat, and life support systems, that makes it inhospitable
---
Personally I never found myself using more than one shotgun type, since each one is baqsically a straight upgrade. My main problem was running low just from how fast I would burn through ammo fighting enemies, and generally lacking plastic to make more. 
---
Nerfed TSE will give you 45% more base damage. In my opinion that's reasonable. It's way stronger than non legendaries but not over the top. But that's only me.
---
THAT WEIGHT THO
---
I got an 2* instigating / explosive CR that I barely touch. Might need to whip it out.
---
They already have fallout shelter for mobile, I’d like to keep track of my toons quests, locations, and inventory 
---
well im pissed to say the least i spent many many hours at west tek to get my 2 shot lever action rifle and it will soon be just another crap ~~legendary~~ item i trough on the ground.... sad, I also have well over 400 hours playing this game and trade items everyday to many different venders and never have i seen the so called duped super items for sale NEVER.... how is this?
---
exactly Its mostly a PVE game anyway to be honest. We need good endgame stuff. It feels depressing to know next week I will log in and my hard work was for nothing. 
---
They should just have "easy servers", where all monsters are 3* and all player damage is x10 so that player's that complain about completely broken guns can go and 1 shot everything with anything. 
---
Not really i have both and i have been wanting for TSE to be nerfed simple they are just to OP, It's true melee can be OP but you also got to remember you need to be up close before you can do anything but with TSE you can just stand 50m away and one shot anything in your way.
---
I was able to get in a full Nuka Cola PA set that someone was actively repairing in white springs.  I dropped out of inventory so they could have it back but yes, this is possible
---
And a buff to Gatling gun rof

The context doesn't fit.
---
Here on r/fo76 the average complaint thread is something to do with Whitesprings and a small brigade of people responding to every "duping sucks" thread with cries of witch hunting. You can actually witch hunt inanimate objects here. It's weird.
---
Fallout 76 doesn't exist in a vacuum. The same community feedback applies as it has applied in the last game(s) - explosive was too strong, see Fallout 4. Energy weapons are still awful, etc.
---
Using a thread that started as a suggestion to improve the sub where every reply includes gems like "the most broken game I've ever played" are counter-intuitive actions.
---
I am become envy, destroyer of worlds.
---
How TF you ment to kill the queen without TSE when you got 5 below lv20 “attempting” to kill the queen with you ? 
---
Need the big damage or it’s next to impossible to do 
---
That sounds like a great idea, which means Bethesds will never do it 
---
Watoga is like the assaultron head, cursed lol
---
Not sure if workshops are currently working or designed correctly - only the person trying to claim the workshop from you should be able to PVP you.  So you will have a notification before you are in full PVP vs. someone.
---
super duper works with power armor, when making my first x-01 yesterday both the right arm and leg got doubled, they were in the frames inventory and for some reason the max durability were tiny bit different so crafted durability is slightly random? or maybe the duplicated piece doesnt get affected by other perks that affect crafted durability
---
What's updog?
---
Since the update I've been blue screening more than double then what I have been. 
---
But there’s no oxygen left inside the vault 
---
I thought this was fixed in the past 3 patches?
---
So basically they made the 2 shot like the violent prefix from fallout 4? Honestly they could just adjusted explosive damage and moved the explosive legendary effect to the same prefix pool as 2 shot, there by having balance. To debuff a prefix that you are removing entirely from being obtained in the future is nonsense. 
---
Herbivore is for ranged builds and carnivore is for melee builds. You can have them all but your character will suck at somethings. Talons, for example, only works if you are unarmed, otherwise it's a straight-up -4 agility which will ruin your ability to use vats, sneak, or run for more than 4 seconds without becoming out of breath. Best thing to do is get 1-2 really good ones then buy the rest as mutation serums.
---
I got nothing. It sounds pretty strange that it's exactly 15-20 minutes and completely independent of an action you're taking. Any way to try that on a different console?
---
After the patch I have weirdness in Watoga and on-load but I don't crash much. They're usually lock ups or I just can't move.
---
I don't watch any of the clickbait dingbats on YouTube. I don't need anyone making ad revenue to tell me that I should not be crashing, disconnecting, freezing, or tripping over bugs in all the activities I like doing for a game that was released by a "triple A" (snicker, that term is so dead) studio.
---
If your preferred activities have not had these issues, then great! Congrats. You're having fun because your frustration level has not exceeded your enjoyment level. Simple.
---
For many others the reverse is true.
---
It's actually a fact that 76 is the most broken game I've ever played in my experience. I said we need a place to vent, I'm venting lol 
---

---
I dont know of any subs but im uk aswell im lv70 i play with my 2 brothers lv 74 and lv20 and a friend who is lv45 we just mess about explore we have a camp set up at the far south part of the savage divide come check it out if u want username liquidlycan08
---
yup its pretty pathetic. I just switched over from GTA too so its crazy to see people cry about getting one shotted like its the end of the world. Thing that makes me the most angry is how much I actually like this game. This whole ordeal is such a buzz kill. 
---
well if all the items should be comparable to all other items then why even have legendaries at all your logic makes no sense  
---
i feel your pain, atleast it wasnt a 1 * auto stim wood leg.
---
I'm having the same issue.  fireproof x3, dense Robot chest.  all limbs are leaded max level marine armor.  point blank shots still blow me up.  How can I get my DR up if you guys think that is the problem?  Chest right now is 60, limbs are around 25 each.
---
Yeah, because nerfing the guns everyone was buying and thus creating massive new demand for other guns is going to slow down their sales..
---
Isnt a good TSE roll on the right weapon basically PvE godmode? Ive read people saying they had to stop using them to feel challenged again. Just what ive read, not personal experience.
---
Wish i could upvote this 10000 times
---
Red Rocket Mega Shop. filled with cars and trucks going through
---
ALWAYS know Whois around you. Too many douchebaggery in this game wanting to profit of your work.
---
Yesterday after grinding returned to my camp to see a lowbie take some purified water, fruits and vegetables. I was fine with that but when he started to attack my turrets, I got angry.
---
Asked him politely please don’t attack my turrets.
---
I could see he was clearly conflicted. He knew I was taller. Not sure if he had another toon, to toggle to
---
After an awkward few minutes he finally left.
---
Use Martial Artist with it.
---
And the Gatling Gun is actually pretty strong without the Martial Artist shenanigan.
---
Because you’re a liar. You ain’t getting a TSE cheap. 
---
&gt;  Then go to ham!  
---
I dunno, something's not kosher here
---
It tells you a lot when a fanboy like you cannot give specific in game examples, only "YES, CUZ CHEATERS HAVE BEEN BANNED!!!!!! SO REWARDING!!!!444444"
---
All of this but rename it whitespring resort!
---
It's a new -bug- feature
---
This was my greatest worry about a combined PVE/PVP game - the PVE game being nerfed to cater to edge case extremes in PVP. Things that wouldn't have been changed in PVE being removed or reduced purely because they can become overpowering if used in a particular way in PVP.  
---
Why do bobbleheads stack in the first place when most other things don't? Why do pacifist-toggled characters take slap damage in the first place when they've opted out of PVP entirely?  
---
It's not so much about the items being nerfed, as the mindset that leads them to nerf a game played predominately as PVE to cater to those playing PVP. It's concerning for a future direction that doesn't interest me.
---
Yeah the 15-20 minutes thing makes me think it is a memory leak or something timing related. I have every mutation and have a maxed out base.. Maybe that has something to do with it. I'm not sure. I'll try to install the game on a friends ps4 to check if it's the character or the ps4 or a combo of both. I have already cleaned the cache and delete internal ps4 save data to no avail.. If I'm lucky it'll go for a little longer than 20 minutes but.. My average crashes per hour has gone from 1 or 2..too 3-5.. It's really bad. I've spoken to Bethesda customer support and have gotten a slew of suggestions and I've tried them all. Nothing seems to work for me.
---
I hope someday they make laser and plasma weapons modded with the splitter are affected by shotgun perks... A man can dream 
---
Durr...suggestion...stash size!! Dupes. Hurr...duh...durr. Skyrim.
---
I do it increases it a bit it says 400 rpm and with speedy barrel and martial artist it's says 500 rpm but it sure doesn't seem so lol
---
No, we already have that. Hold still just a sec longer...
---
Mutations were bugged a while ago. Have you had them for a while? Have you tried clearing them?
---
I can give you some serums to restore some of them, but I don't have them all.
---
The only other long standing "my character is broken" thing I know of involves treasure maps.
---
Good suggestion
---
i did the same, personally i wasnt set on a build mostly because i didnt have a good weapons to focus around so i picked and still getting all of the QOL perks first (crating, repairing etc.) and it has been very nice not repairing and getting a lot of double items from crafting and all the ammo
---
Mutations and  Bobbleheads 
---
Melee perks mutations
---
Yeah, that rpm thing is nonsense. Unless they mean like.... per minutes-times-15....
---
If you have chameleon armor and sneak peeks it’s very hard to be found especially against scorchbeasts for some reason death claws find me instantly but it’s super powerful you can get the sneak to do 2.5X the weapons normal damage 3X at night your going to want escape artist and maybe a couple pieces of sentinel armor with chameleon to take less damage because normal your not going to be moving also get VATS perks when invisible it’s really hard to aim vats helps a ton and if you get luck perks the crits can be devastating. I would definitely recommend getting a good lever gun if you want single shot weapons it’s powerful and fun to use. Hope that helps;)
---
Melee damage perks + Bloody Mess, high strength and sometimes people use chems for damage buffs.
---
I am happy about the second loading screen, but that still doesn't mean everything is loaded once it goes away. It still can take up to ONE MINUTE after that on my base PS4 until all assets are showing up (for example the settler body outside Watoga station, or the carrot flowers next to the Whitesprings service entrance), and I can jump or move around without lag. Plus, I still get reset to the start point (a.k.a. deja vu mechanic) if I enter an interior cell like the Whitesprings bunker or main building and start to move immediately. This is disorienting, and it breaks immersion.
---
And Bethesda, please, make the client crashes a priority issue. This happens WAY too often now, and in completely random situations (and I'm not overencumbered and I do routinely weed out my inventory). I don't even start longer events like Patrol Duty any longer because I know I will probably crash before reaping the rewards.
---
Thanks for the effort! The numbers tell me that the nerfs are quite reasonable. I like them.
---
Hmm I'll actually try to clear all my mutations and see how that works.. What's this about treasure maps? I have 100s of them....
---
Any guess or idea how this is going to affect two shot weapons that actually fire two projectiles. Like the Gauss Rifle, plasma weapon, or missile launcher or grenade launcher?
---
Implementing the reduction of damage buff makes sense (just from an implementation perspective) for any of the hitscan weapons. That is, most rifles, pistols, etc. But for weapons that actually fire a second projectile, how is that going to work?
---
Side note: Why are they nerfing firearms? I don't think I've ever been one shot with a gun. Now a player with a hammer? That player will one shot everything within reach. Guns already suck so hard. Is this some liberal left-wing anti-gun agenda in game?
---
I haven't even gotten a tse weapon myself but I've been grinding trying to get one for a long time, thanks for fucking that dream right in the ass bethesda.
---
As a live service type of game feedback is extremely important. I. Fallout 4 they easily ignored things cause modding could fix almost any issue you had and they had VERY little incentive to update or fix the game. The money will stop rolling in if the community isn't satisfied. Especially with a multiplayer game the balancing issues are very important as you cannot create a mod that changes the specs of weapons etc. So it is up to Bethesda to fix the issues and respond to our feedback. 
---
The majority of of feedback threads lately have been very specific and they're already fixing specific issues we've been talking about. 
---
Using one big thread for those kind of suggestions is stupid but for just people complaining about no NPCs or larger unlikely to be changed aspects of the game they ought to keep down unless they wanna be helpful 
---
As with every update, looking forward to the next. Maybe the game will stop crashing, maybe the servers will stop crashing, maybe we'll be finally able to use automatics.
---
I like to switch out my weapons when ammo runs low, so if they had two different shotgun ammo types I could use one and leave the other at home.
---
Yeah, I thought about train station, and indeed rebuilding the tracks to allow people of your faction to fast travel for free , or even better, allowing your faction to perceive a tax on these stations, making the prices lower at the merchants there, would be interesting and motivatin.
---
Bloodied is trash, why does anyone think that it's good? Only with a full melee build does bloodied make any difference. Oh, you're sitting at 10% hp and you're not melee, BLAH you're gahfucked by a random scorched thing in one hit, so much for that extra 200 (maybe) damage on your gun, idiot. Thanks for the junk, and you know what Ima tea bag you your corpse while I keep on killin, scrub.
---
I have 14 mutations... bobbleheads though, never used one
---
If you stand on a treasure mound that you have a lot of maps for and spam the button you'll be really sorry.....
---
My character on PC was broken for a week. Other people still can't use their characters.
---
What perks exactly? I’ve looked online but most info is from beta and doesnt seem helpful beyond level 12
---
Thanks I threw some mods on it but put it away. I prefer my Grognak and 2 shot gatling. If you are on XB1 I got a 2* Junkies/Explosive collecting dust and a few others because I'm a Nukespring hoarder. 
---
Yeah, well I feek that if a faction is strong enough to take a nuke full face, fight all fucktards coming to claim the place, then rebuild, all that in one hour, taking another one in the face is not OP.
---
Bear in mind most people won't be connected for 8hours straight, meaning the average player will have to deal with max 2 nukes, 3top. That sounds more awesome than painful.
---
You have it wrong to what the post is saying. That position doesn't allow Forward Station Delta to sit just outside of nuke zone. What you're sharing is what the OP is suggesting as what he's used to.
---
He means that you nuke Northwest of Prime, so that Prime sits in the Southeast edge of the nuke zone. Then Forward Station Delta is just Southeast of that. So now you can stand on the ramparts of Forward Station Delta, outside of the nuke zone, and go ham on the SBQ. All enemies are then funneled up the stairs. It's the superior way to fight her.
---
Your image shows exactly what everyone has been doing for weeks, and misses the point of the OP.
---
Slightly? 15% percent or less might be considered as slightly but a 75% nerf is ridiculous. Not at all surprised considering the other bullshit they’ve pulled. 
---
The nerfs were needed and simple to implement. Not seeing the problem.
---
That's a thing? God damn it
---
 I've done it before but maybe I didn't spam that fast. I have so many treasure maps damn wendigos drop em like crazy
---
Also, obviously 1 hand or 2 hand damage increase.
---
whoa, that makes me feel less special with my 15 luck, i though it was just me, i smell a nerf incoming. 
---
This is exactly the sort of post I was looking for thank you! As a fellow rifleman this is obviously disappointing as I doubt I'll be much use in a SBQ fight now. But it was nice to join in while I could.
---
It already is too easy. Even ESO has nearly impossible (to PuG) dungeons. Let’s go already please. 
---
Fist weapons. Incredibly broken base damage.
---
Bye the way I have no idea if chameleon stacks would recommend at least 2 pieces Incase one breaks also some armor does have sneak related mods like sleek so move faster when crouching and another that makes you harder to detect when sneaking I only have 2 levels of sneak and found it to be enough most of the time
---
OMG, sounds terrible. Def won't be doing that. The clearing the mutations was actually a good suggestion.. Def gonna try that. If only you could see how bad ass my base and everything is. Then you'd see why I'm salty. I loved this game until this bluescreening started getting worse . 1or crashes per session I can deal with even tho that was annoying. Now it's just on a whole other level
---
Yeah, a venting thread would be nice. Can I express frustrations here, I spent 49 caps traveling to Irrational Fear then the game gets stuck on the loading screen. Did Heart of the Swamp a few minutes later and a Strangler Ghoul was stuck inside  some rocks so the Strangler Heart never opened again.
---
I kind of want the PvP server to draw off all the griefers and exploiters and dupers that can't dupe anymore (hopefully) but still have lots of stuff to get rid of. 
---
they should do that too with the other perks, you dont need a 5 point or 3 point perk at level 15
---
Buuut, you need the gasmask for certain daily photo challenges, don't scrap it! ;-)
---
There is another BOS hat, looks like this ... https://imgur.com/a/wvqaZn6
---
It can be found in the Appalachia Antiques on a shelf.
---
To add to this a little. I would love to see some of the events give reward based on what they are trying to accomplish. 
---
Feed the people constantly producing food after the event is over. So that if the event has been done people came come over the the factory and pick up some chow.
---
Bloody mess. I’m missing that entirely. Cheers!
---
Lol.. counter... 1v1.. what game are you playing exactly? I think you missed the flying magic school bus to fortnite, it's back in 2018.
---
That is a weird ass system too. Like I convert my TS hunting rifle to 50 Cal and I can now craft 180 rounds just like that.
---
They also do less damage than 308?! How?:
---
How were you able to get that so high with non PA?
---
Man, if somebody cannibalised me instead of reviving me, let me tell you...
---
 I'm gonna be SALTY.
---
Wait a minute. Throwing the responsibility and credit of post release maintenance on modding is an all too easy mistake that gets made a lot.
---
Go see the explosives scenario that played out in Fallout 4. Sure, _some_ users on _one_ platform may have modded out explosives "in the name of honor"...... But it still got attention from the publisher as it should have.
---
I'll restate again that the feedback and moderation on this sub _does not_ emerge conversation and is certainly counter intuitive - once again, the sub here is vicious about witch hunting the witch hunter witch hunted witch huntlings, but the actual publisher is removing dupe glitches.
---
That should be a fine weapon man, as long as you have the penetration and cripple cards as well. However, the more people there, the more health she has. So if you only see four or five people there, you please do great. If you something more like 10 to 15 people there, that gun will seem to do nothing all the sudden. Still, the damage is going in. Just bring a ton of ammo and it's durability maxed out or a couple backup weapons. People got alittle over reliant on legendary TSE, but she is very killable at level 50 with standard weapons, it just a very long fight.
---
45% base damage plus **is** legendary. 200% plus AOE plus indefinitely expl. bobbleheads is way over the top.
---
The wastelands can be a hard cold place full of hungry bastards.
---
i mean, it's just trashed... they would obviously change the aesthetics with an update of this nature.
---
Crouching removes you from the map for players. I doubt they blocked a person to follow them.
---
Your frustrations are welcome here friend. Sorry to hear about that. This game has so much potential when it occasionally works..that's definitely a really aggravating bug. Can't say I've never had any like that. 
---
The Dragon isn't a shotgun it's a rifle 
---
And that is good. Instead of having one viable option, we have now multiple. 
---
Oh my bad 
---
Game has ran like shit on my xbox since day one beta
---
I remembered Sentinels from FO4 and have kept two pieces with no other good mods on them in case I had a reason to use them. Does the effect work even when crouching? I remember the text from FO4 was basically take 15% less damage whilst standing and not moving.
---
What about quest rewards?
---
Yup iv tried my hardest to give this game as many benifits of the doubt as I could and ignore all the brokenness because I genuinely love fallout. The best and extremely rare weapons in the game should make the game easier where you don't have to be mele or chug stimpaks. Anyone who thinks they want to waste 500 rounds every time a scorche beast decides it want to eat them is nuts. Anyone saying these weapons should be nerfed to this extent hasn't fought a max level enemy without them. 14 rounds to kill a super mutant with a shotgun in shotgun range is nuts. Is Bethesda trying to kill this game on purpose? Do they realize how many hours we spend to grind these weapons? A TSE Handmade took me over 2 months of grinding and I don't even get to use it for a week. It says "two shot" not "fires a second rubber bullet" it says "explosive" not "flash bang". This is fallout for Christ sake if you want a PvP shooter go play call of duty. Oh wait someone might kill you in a second. Your getting shot what do you expect people? Im going from being one of the few defending this game and buying my friends copies so they will try it after all the bad press and find out how good it is to becoming someone who will trash it every chance I get. Bethesda can go to hell after this crap. I will never buy anything from them again ever no matter how good everyone says it is. 2 months of wasted gaming that should have been spent on a companys game that can make a damn game. 
---
Definitely agree though damage buffs on the lmg for sure, and the mini gun too. They dump rounds but the damage is horrid...
---
THIS. I despise all those guys and remember very clearly the first time I ran across a queen. Now at lvl 98 I still avoid her (even after they nerfed that awful op acid attack) and continue to despise the rest. 
---
I was thrilled one time when the fog of radiation lifted from WS and everyone went home. I never get that chance at the good enemies. I got my TS dbl shotty from the glowing golf club spawns  and chewing through God knows how many hundred fusion cells in my telsa riding solo (lone wanderer perk ftw) I'm finally feeling like I can really relax and not carry 5 different weapons and 30 some odd stims and now the one gun I have that does decent damage will be nerfed? 
---
I was glad for having made enough sales of dropped garbage 1* loot to have finally broken into having over 1k caps. Didn't last long after I found some plans I wanted.
---
Yeah I know, one shot most things with only 27O weapon damage, love it. But I come from ESO where stamina melee is... well not great, but still!
---
I want a buff to my TS rocket launcher.
---
I have a sniper / shotgunner build. The thing with sniper is that sinper rifle barely reach 200 damage. My sniper rifle does 170 dam and my gauss rifle has 230 dam.
---
I have rifleman perk cards maxed, long shot and a lot of point in agility like maxed sneak. 
---
Sniper card is pointless imo.
---
Stealth boys are ok depending on the enemy. Some enemies see you even through stealth boy effect.
---
Its great to clear from high positions, but youll need a close range build also, so keep your fav melee weapon around. 
---
I'm torn. I do want to force new characters just for these, but at the same time, I just started one prepped for them.

pretty much fully working usable weapons that arent going to break soon
---
[SUGGESTION] Dear Bethesda, MAKE OUR CAMPS SPAWN TSE WEAPONS
---
This would line up with my experiences too. I’m starting to see mods that I have never seen before. 
---
I can agree with the upgraded lining too, once you obtain one, the new one begins to appear in vendors inventory. 
---
I've gone through the ocean of bugs ,missing features ,server disconnects and crashes.This is where i draw the line. I've farmed hundreds of hours to get two-shot weapons and now they're basically shitting on me 
---
Yeah, they made the comment after I posted, or at least I read it afterwards. 
---
I believe it still works
---
That’s awesome 
---
Yeah me too yet i saw people praising the after update connections
---
PSA: bad is entirely a personal opinion. Thats fine too. We all have them.
---
Actually the constant nerfs are what shit on the good parts of this game. If you don’t like em and want the challenge of playing without one, then go do that. Simple solution. 
---
I seem to be encountering a recurring issue with VATS on Xbox X. 
---
Every now and again I will go to use VATS, it will make the animation sound and then it seems to get stuck in a recurring loop. It won't lock on to the enemy and everything graphically and sound wise starts to stutter. This goes away as soon as that particular enemy is killed and then seems to be fine on the next. It doesn't happen very often but seems to be ongoing as I have had this issue since release. 
---
If you try the re download and it helps can you let me know  don't really want to re download the game. 
---
Yeah they removed it due to it benefitting from these perks, classic band-aid fix that spawns this follow-up issue. I can kinda understand it but at the same time there's this class of hyper powerful explosive weapons in the game with easier to get &amp; carry ammo that didn't get looked at at the same time so it is... weird. ;)
---
They have been shitting on us since before day 1.
---
I hate to see what the next ES game is going to look like.
---
Anyone know if the AP mags affect explosive damage as well, or just ballistic?
---
I run a stealth build usually, and use snipers, but it's not a Sneaky Sniper Build, so I can't comment on everything.
---
At maxed Sneak, with the Disappearing perk (yes, for running away to reset Sneak), I can sneak past almost anything besides Scorchbeasts and higher level enemies without entering Caution Status (level 40)
---
I was running a Suppressed Hardened Hunting Rifle, non-legendary, so it sometimes took a few shots to kill, but the Rifle and Sneak Attack perks would probably help with that a lot.
---
Stealth Boys feel useless at max Stealth, Chameleon Armour would probably be more practical than the Mutation, just because of Armour.
---
Not sure if that helps, just a few thoughts I've had while building/running my own Stealth build.
---
i mean, i was a proponent of a nerf,
---
just not a 75% nerf across the board.
---
I haven’t tried their online version yet. The pay to win aspect is keeping me from playing it. I know damn well I’ll get frustrated and end up spending so it’s best I stay away. That’s the one thing I love about fallout is that I don’t have to spend unless I want to. I spent 20 dollars at the atom store for a couple things but it was purely my own decision and I didn’t feel pressured to do so. 
---
I guess they’re not into interior walls and love the open plan life lol 😂
---
I know for sure the health bar of the items is improved, but it doesn't appear to be better affixes.  It appears to just be random.  He still gets plenty of one star stuff from 3 star enemies.
---
you can buy it at Harpers ferry vendor much cheaper
---
I will add you. My level is 39 and username Salsanadia
---
Wont TSE damage boost basically still be 75%, because TS is triggering Explosive twice, that 25% damage bonus from TS and 2x25% from Explosive.
---
Melee will get it's nerf aswell. Just wait for it. And it's good. (both nerfs)
---
There really shouldn't be a way to double a weapons damage before you apply any perks. Doesn't matter if accuracy went down.
---
I dont use ammo, I just give it away. I'm on PS4 if you are ever in need. Ill give you what I got. Also, a free bag of fertilizer. My brahmin make the best fertilizer in the wasteland guaranteed. 
---
The problem is that Bethesda cannot tell whether an item is duped or not. Sure, you can guess that something is fishy when someone has 1 million bobbleheads in their inventory, but still items are not marked as "duped" by any system in the game, so they might would just delete legitimately looted weapons/items.
---
Same I even got my cousin a copy hes gonna be pissed when he finds out his two shot lever action is shit now. But yea I feel the exact same way, ive defended this game every step of the but this is like a slap in the face. 
---
You shouldn't: they'll weigh you down a ton and let you down even more.
---
Mind telling me what mutations your running?  As well as perk cards?  I'm not able to see my build but I'm guessing your running Serendipity, starched jeans, nerd rage, a bloodied weapon, marsupial and speed demon, but what other mutations are you running?
---
I can see further than the game can load on ps4
---
There is a vault tec jumpsuit as well.
---
sorry, thats was more pointing out all of these legendary weapons people are trading with tiny CND bars versus the (almost) exact same base weapon having a larger one. Luck effects that. 
---
I have a feeling luck makes better legendary stuff drop because it increases the value of the loot you find. the only way to really do that with a legendary weapon is to add more stars. I can say that when i hit 15 luck i started getting better loot overall, im the only person on my regular team that routinely finds better equipment than everyone else in containers and on corpses. And they call out their loot so i know what crap they are finding. 
---
&gt; Luck has always been a useful stat and, even though its only directly affected statistic is **critical hits**, it has other functions as well. **It affects the value of loot** when **opening chests** or **looting corpses** so it greatly affects the quality of items and capability in earning money. 
---

People think all the internet is their stage and everyone else is the Audience. So they never stop and think someone else might have already talked about it. When you see yourself as the star, why would you ever think someone else might be a star too?
---
Not sure about the heavies. I have a two-shot .50 and the accuracy loss on the two-shot is significant enough to make it noticeable on mid to long-range. On some enemies I'm sure an armor-piercing one would be better than the TS. I can imagine the accuracy hit on a gatling gun would also mean that you can't easily 'snipe' with it anymore.
---
Having said that: Transforming the engagement profiles of guns is not a bad thing. Shotguns are, of course, a special case here and I agree. 
---
Nice of you, but that is not the Point of this Post.

And proximity chat would be implemented how exactly? You can't have 2 cells in 1. New players are in the vault. That's what it's for. You  can't have a bunch of high levels ysppin and trading in chat with lvl 1s trying to figure out wth is going on. Sorry, it just doesn't work. I think top if the world would be perfect tho or the enclave bunker.

What witch hunting are you talking about? Identifying dupers?
---
I'll be honest in that I wasn't aware of the specifics of the explosive issue in f04 since I remember not being able really play it at the time of release. I've gone back and played. I meant that a cohesive community opinion was less important then as modding ( at least on PC) could really change most anything they wanted. 
---
The latter is very subjective. Not knowing the specifics of the issue I would have thought they'd have done a better job this time as it seems to have been an issue from before and they were fine releasing it the way they did. 
---
Unless the issue was something completely different Bethesda was fine enough with how they worked in the game to release it as is and then make changes after a huge uproar that had people very upset and obviously very opinionated. If they're talking about specifics is still productive. How would you like feedback to happen 
---
Shit. 
---
He's going to give you a bag of shit. 
---
The fo4 system is fine in a single player game but isn’t in a multiplayer one.
---
Multiplayer is about interaction and complementarity. Both fo4 and fo76 let each player be a master of all trades and so none is fit for the job

---
Do you have the game on a HDD or SSD?
---
Me too. I like it a lot with the crystallizing barrel
---
i maxed out 2 handed and iron fist. Plus incisor. Then radicool. with some unyielding, almost all mutations I pack about 600 - 1k damage per swing no chems.
---
even if you loot everything and drop it to the ground as a paper bag that is 100% better for the server because now it only has 1 object versus each pile. 
---
Just because you have fun with it doesn't mean it isn't the most broken AAA game on the market right now. 
---
The reviews simply point out how unacceptable it is to release a game in this state today and charge $60+ EURO for it. And they are right. Ofc you can enjoy the game but you also can't just blatantly ignore all the problems it has
---
Exactly what I wad going to say even 25% would have been ok. 75% is insane, its not even two shot anymore.
---
I mentioned the extra stash to my SO a couple of weeks ago. Take a page out of some MMOs which have banks, have a separate server just keeping track of people's banked items allowing for long term storage which can only be accessed in one place in the world, in your suggestion it would be in vault 76. It could allow us to have more storage space without adding extra stress to the servers. At the very least it would stop me needing 3 characters to store all my things. 
---
Fullscreen ?
---
Ahh I forgot about the text chat mod since I am leery of using mods at the moment.  Good call though and thanks for sharing!
---
Right, so you need a 3 point perk card and specific base location with a lead extractor to get that ammo efficiently.... That still sounds like more of a hassle and rarer than other ammo.
---
Not that important. Mine is in a hdd and it's rock solid.
---
The playerbase numbers for an open world survival MMO are pretty bloody good, what are you smoking?
---
Love it. But I don't think being able to fast travel there while over encumbered is a good idea. If I grab too much junk I need to be ready to waddle my butt to the nearest bench.
---
I was just being snarky but thanks I'll go check that out I must skimmed it. 
---
Get a Combat Shotgun with Armor Penetration, slap the Drum Mag on that bad boy and you're good to go
---
Good bot
---
Let's be real here, in 1 year most of the player base will have migrated to better and newer games like the upcoming Outer Worlds
---
It does exist, though Im not sure of it origins as I gained through trade, please see the link below for a screenshot. One thing to note is it actually has protection as well, the only head gear I know of that does:
---

---
Starting to prefer drums for the simple fact of stagger chance increased  before reload.
---
Inluding an area to gift new\\low players, just like the suitcases are been using in various train stations.
---
I would love caravan. I actually used a mod in new vegas that made it playable forever. It's an easy way to make caps early on too. Unfortunately, many people never understood how to play.
---
I think noobs out of 76 are more about inflicting more PR damage than anything else. you literally arent told anywhere that you cant die to a player under level 5 except maybe a loading screen. 
---
noobs out the vault on console could potentially be a redbox/gamefly/gamepass player that has zero money invested into the game and some dumbass in a clown mask just made the population go down by 1. 
---
sorta like limits on the size of the fish you can catch in real life you need to let them level up a little bit before you go and ruin their day. 
---
Plans are always in the same spot in PC and you can quickly walk in and check.  
---
It took a lot of server hopping on the PC but I got them.  
---
I assume your after the marine mask?
---
There was a mod for this in F4 and it was great. :(
---
I had wondered what that was. On multiple occasions I have seen technical data, with the plans model on the ground randomly, unable to be looted.
---
Im waiting for the vault updates. Nothing to really do atm
---
I think I understand the point of your post, though I am a simple brahmin farmer. You want to turn ammo of an unneeded type into the ammo of a needed type. 
---
Until that glorious day occurs, I am offering you free ammo, plus a bag of the finest brahmin excrement in all the wasteland. As I do not use it and it just gathers dust in my inventory. Hell if it would make you feel better, you give me 2 - 4 bullets of your unwanted for every one bullet of wanted. This way it simulates your idea bullet world. 
---
?Why? Are you using some ancient crt monitor?
---
Hey you can still loot legendary pool cues. Isn't that awesome?
---
I have the Helmet in Stash box on my Marine build.
---
Don’t forget about the vendor next to “Top of the World”.  You have to clear out SM to get to that one though.
---
Dick players (like the duper’s) like making other players life miserable so if I was her I’d just wait (don’t put in the keycard and code) until the Lv 100+ gets bored because he’s using is own time to try to screw with you so he might go away or if he gives up and puts in the code quickly enter the location for the nuke and he would have wasted a key card, the one way to counter people like this is to act like the alpha and not give him any fun from bulling you. It worked for me when a group of high levels were constantly attacking me when I was a low level so I just got them to waste their ammunition because they can’t do much damage to me when I don’t fight back. Hopefully this doesn’t happen to her again.
---
I’ve had this and to add to it if you immediately try to pop your pip boy up to look at something it will lock your control indefinitely. You can go to the map and fast travel but even at the new location your controls won’t work 
---
Thos who have a TSE : nay ! Those who don't : yea !
---
Suggestion: Allow more than 24 people so that this "multiplayer" game actually feels like one. 
---
'Balancing' aka oh shit what are we doing.
---
The nerf is necessary. You shouldn't be able to one shot everything.
---
Something my friend and I talked d about too... would the pros  out weigh the cons type of thing.
---
&gt;For mortal online, going after bambi was a huge motivator to play the game right. Find a guild, join a group, and hide until you can  compete 
---
yep, i was talkinga bout MO and DF, Xsyon also came out around 2011 and a lot of MO and DF people were jumping around in there killing bambi left and right because it was full loot with no penalties other that getting hunted. 
---
that game has two servers now and pvp is basically dead, i was able to loot so much from so many abandoned towns because there are no more players on that server to the point i quit playing.
---
They need to let us respec daily so we can HAVE FUN and try different builds when we get loot for them 
---
Release the game on Steam.
---
looterally
---
&gt; Bethesda actually wanted \[...\] it obviously didn't fucking work. 
---
&gt; That doesn't mean we should shit on other people's ideas 
---
As in your own words, don't be rude about others ideas.
---
You're contradictory and unnecessarily aggressive. Sorry that you have to resort to such pathetic means to try and end a discussion where you're clearly wrong. I'm not going against the idea of this players, I'm just noting that there is already a fully functional area that has all of this.
---
I spent an insane amount of time farming the rare event cosmetics. The drop chance on them is so low that most people don't even think they're in the game.

Any form of character reset or character separation would be soul crushing for players like myself.
---
I understand that the difference between new and veteran players (heavily geared players) is going to be tough on pvp servers, but that's going to happen regardless over time and there's also no guarantee another exploit won't pop in later down the line. In that event do they have to abandon another set of players and create PVP Gamemode 2?
---
I understand that the duping and exploiting has negatively impacted the game and how its played, but there's players who have put some serious time into collecting non combat items who're just going to tossed aside.
---
I mean.. The queen has been killed in under 5 minutes the last 5 times I killed her. I'm fine with it being a bit harder. 
---
Do you mean a Stash to sell stuff to other players? Because there is a player stash in the crafting room.
---
But don’t you understand that “balance” means making the game easy for my play style?
---
It's not even identifying dupers. As mentioned, you can "witch hunt" inanimate objects here... And people have applied witch hunting to PVP players, as well.
---
Right now, the average emerging topic is about the two-shot prefix change and people are still saying they're being removed from the game entirely .... Which is wildly incorrect.
---
Actual PVP balance is met with cries of witch hunting and denying service to "PVP enthusiasts". Mention Bobbleheads? Witch hunter. I can be near invincible with Lone Wanderer and Sentinel. Mention it should be balanced because I'm bored standing there while I can't be killed and you'll be a witch hunter. ;)
---
Pre-patch the Empath shenanigans were magical. See any threads about it?
---
Laser Gatling charging caps were buffed, but that change definitely didn't source from here. Do you also use the Bethesda forums?
---
I'll be honest... I hate having a tse. If it's a 10, the popular variants of explosive are a 7.. everything else legendary is a 1-3. 
---
It makes EVERYTHING way too easy. I have just shy of 600hours in the game.. and TSE literally killed it for me. I didn't care about my legendaries anymore.. I was reliant on its power in pvp.. it all became mundane. 
---
I want playing anymore.. I was just shooting stuff.
---
could have a chest labeled "Donations - Feed the Poor or Die"
---
Try being level 187 and wanna move around cards.. Takes so long
---
i spent nearly 100 hours fully exploring the map, listening to all the holotapes i find and reading every terminal i can, not gunna do all that again just so i can play with different weapons 
---
I'm sorry you refuse to believe basic game mechanics. The game scaled the NPCs according to player level and zone. I have been level 15 at Whitesprings killing level 8 ghouls and level 20 at Watoga killing level 9 bots. It scales. Regardless of how you want to believe. You only come across high level NPCs where a high level character has been recently.
---
I have a TSE and I think it is good. The game is getting boring since I can 1 shot any non legendary enemy. This is supposed to be a survival game. Stop crying because you are not OP anymore
---
I'd like to see a future update giving us a faction style workshop / vault that we can make a guild and build a base for them as it would be instanced it could be larger without the need for as much restrictions as with no turrets and no in game effects other then a meeting place it wouldn't effect anyone 
---
another option is to turn the top of the world middle floor into a place like this giving vendors and such plenty of room with keeping it instanced
---
I like this one, thank you.
---
Yeah, I've been noticing that lately
---
So one thing I discovered is that herbivore does not cancel out cannibal. It also does not seem to cancel out prepackaged food items, as I am still able to eat salisbury steaks. I can also eat dog food. 
---
Minus the music. 
---
Where was I crying ? You are bored ? Don't use the TSE. Duh.
---
My dream the wear the skin of my enemies, the trees, into battle... has been foiled
---
they still need to figure out a reward system, killing people for wortless things like caps and materials is wortless, and most people act like the scorched anyway. just make a reason to do pvp. a simple stuff that you can only get from pvp would be enough
---
agreed...not to mention what a pain in the butt it is transferring those items between characters are.
---
This is the biggest issue. Sometimes the game resets itself to borderless window and the framerates drop
---
don't know why you were downvoted. I agree with OP, people ask for ridiculous shit that would be terrible, but that doesn't mean *all* suggestion posts are bad. there are some legitimate QoL improvements (and otherwise) that should be pointed out because Bethesda is listening. most of these things (like perk builds and known plans) should have been in the game day 1. 
---
there can be a middle ground. there are many productive suggestions, but the fact that people know Bethesda is listening makes everyone think they're *the* Colin Ritman. We end up with a sub filled with armchair devs that want to oversimplify the game.
---
you're taking this raider roleplay a little too far there my dude, turn it down a few notches
---
worse part is if you have something shooting at you and then all the audio gets spammed at once of 150 super mutant bullets in 0.2 secs 
---
I think it's server lag
---
I have an X-01 Jet Pack Mod for sale, xbox 1 gt Hank Hill 7897
---
1. If the servers are stable now (don't know, didn't play on a month), give each player a counter and after 5 events done on the same server reward that player with something.
---
2. If above turns out to be successful and more players would do the events, make escort missions about players:
---
   - give players 5 minutes to register for an escort mission,
---
   - out of registered players chose 1 at random and give him an item that he needs to bring to the destination,
---
   - lock out fast travel for all part participants fot the duration of the event,
---
   - spawn monsters on to attack the caravan.
---
3. Add a hidden counter to count each type of event done and after 5 events of the same type done on 1 server, spawn boss event.
---
4. Add events that will let players contribute materials to finish. Either to build a fort, giant robot, launch a satelite, develop a medicine etc. After the players finish, add a structure to the map.
---
   - either make them short time, temporary and let them buff players,
---
   - or make them permanent and very difficult to build, let all of the players on every server to contribute to this one goal to add new thing that will stay,
---
   - or use those structures to spawn horde event with a boss.
---
5. For pvp servers, make events that would slowly fill the map with a disease, forcing all of the players into one small zone, a'la battle royale.
---
Y'all have way too much time on your hands 
---
Never mind, someone tried to PvP me in monster mash, one shot them with power fist, pretty sure that the number is somewhat irrelevant after 250
---
I love it... spawning in as a floating head with no weapon, being murdered by super mutants before your arms grow back  
---
It’s great -.-
---
Yeah, this is an awesome idea, so they probably won't do it. 
---
Exactly. My best gun is a two-shot pump action. A normal shot does about 15% damage to a supermutant, but with my crit build I can one shot them point blank in the head. Since most of my points are in Str, Agl and Lck, if I don't one shot them, I'm torn to shreds in seconds.
---
&gt; Instead of having one viable option, we have now multiple.
---
Please, Bloodied, Furious (on the weapons it synergized with), and Quad (mostly for Double Barrel) were already being preferred over Two Shot by many in the community. All this does is remove one option while leaving the others untouched and not having crippled VATS. Though the Explosive nerf still leaves a heavy blow and makes the SBQ even more of a DPS check snoozefest.
---
Downplaying an overused, overpowered weapon, which I've never wanted to get in the first place.. Sounds like a good plan. 
---
And yes.. it's the fault of the 99% of the players actually spending that much time getting something, which is clearly unbalanced. I don't mind punishing the sheep players, who all go for the same unbalanced items.  
---
People tend to get used to the easy playstyle (ie. almost exploiting) and then get upset, when they need to play again in a balanced way. I'm more than happy to say, bugger off and don't play online. 
---
 I like to play with fair players.
---
Maybe watch less of those ridiculous streamers and live your own life. 
---
The problem is that buffs are equally just as easy and have yet to be implemented. For example - lazer weapon durability, ammo usage and damage. 
---
Also, where is the nerf to bobbleheads (stacking) and melee? 
---
One could easily argue that with duping, bobbleheads really should be nerfed asap with TSE second and melee a close third. 
---
So I can see the consternation some users have. 
---
True but eventually there will have to be a cap or you'll just be in bullet sponge territory. None of the enemies currently in FO76 employ any sort of tactics to make them harder. 
---
Now is the time for bloodied explosive handmade muhahahhah :D ( im rifle stealth bloodied build :D but i also got like 5 TSE and im little bit pissed :D but not big deal :)
---
It’s a start, something had to be done. 
---
What really needs to happen are plasma/energy weapons needs durability fixes, maybe a dmg buff. Melee seriously needs to be looked at. Idk wtf is going on with the math there... 
---
the factory near flatwoods does this already
---
though it's a claimed workshop,unless you lock it people can come grab stuff
---
no-one ever claims it these days though, all that food is good for is selling to vendors
---
Yeah, it would "humble" me to lose 400+ hours of work on my character.
---
No. Buff everything to the same level of TSE? Did you even think this out beyond “I wanna stay a god!”
---
Definitely, I have to get a friend to guard my things in the infinite space bins while I switch characters, basically if I have no friends online I'm out of options xD
---
For example? Other than maybe junkie with enough addictions? 
---
Sounds like a bug to me. I've done the event a few times and never had any empty containers.
---
If you are tired of all the negativity, you should visit r/Fallout76FilthyCasuals 
---
Whats ur CPU?  Wonder if ur being bottlenecked by ur cpu. 
---
I run it in a 1080ti and certain spots drop to 60’s but other then that its a steady 100+ 
---
Voice Chat would need to me limited to group chat only, or allow people to make custom voice chat channels.
---
Maybe a Vault76 only txt chat????
---
i don't think one shotting everything is great either. I think there shouldn't be bullet sponges. They're not a fun mechanic. It makes being in the endgame suck and makes regular guns absoulte ass. I'd rather have some balance. so make guns in general do way more damage
---
I was unaware of that. Thanks for pointing that out.
---
So you will be boned just like the TSE people only you didn't spend 2 months grinding for your brass knuckles. They need to nerf mele even more than the TSEs. 
---
Are those Cappy glasses?
---
Incisor: next. Cheers!
---
I'm still on my first character and just reached level 35. Taking my time I guess.
---
No matter, I'm still having fun. Can't wait until I tackle a queen :)
---
With Fireproof and dense mod, you have nothing to fear.
---
Sir, I am just a simple shit farmer. My daddy was a shit farmer and his daddy was a shit farmer, and his daddy' daddy was a shit farmer, and his daddy's daddy's daddy, well he was an accountant. Why I provide the best brahmin fertilizer in all the wasteland. My 3 brahmin, thats 6 head, make me so much poo that I cant give it away fast enough. If you ever encounter me, all you gots to do is ask and I will hook you up with a  nice bag or too of brahmin poo. 
---
Jesus Christ just play the game and enjoy it, why do you even care? Keeping lists of people who piss you off 😂
---
Just block them and move on ffs.
---
Honestly, this sub 😂
---
No one is forcing you to use the TSE
---
I wasnt saying you are crying. I was referring to the OP
---
Does Furious have a cap? When does it reset? Time ased, reload, etc.?
---
Man, if you need that much ammo and die that much you must suck hard at this game. Maybe we do need op weapons so that inept people can play the game too.
---
I'm not sure anyone's mentioned it yet, but a the perk that lets you aim at limbs on VATS is a must. Let's you target the weak point, stacked with CRIT and sneak bonus can one shot LVL 68 ghoulies with a refined .50 hunting rifle (craft 180 ammo at a time so have thousands).
---
It's also useful for crippling legs on glowing ones.. slows them right down. 
---
Reply to the OP then, not me.
---
Only adds 10% which is not the worst it’s like 1 card
---
Honestly can probably get away with just demse after the explosive nerf but will need to test obviously.
---
Gatling weapons need a durability buff to at least last 4 cores
---
IMO double the players per server...triple the "Disconnected from Server" messages. I would love more people per server but I just dont know if Beths current server design could handle it.
---
I completed the Mistress of Mysteries chain early on, and I'm glad I did.  I always have my veil on.  It looks pretty bad-ass with a combat helmet and welding goggles.
---
It’s not worth that much unless it’s legendary 
---
I will use it till Bethesda gets off their butt and implements something themselves. I'm a bit uncomfortable with it being a dll though, but it works and that's all I care about.
---
It's a mod that is client side, doesn't impact the server and offers no advantage in 'pvp'. It tells you if you know a plan or not. Period.
---
Pacifist mode, yes. If you’re too lazy to flip on a menu option, you are leaving things to chance and willingly doing so. It’s within your power to prevent these “oops” situations. 
---
I even suspect this is a sneaky way of trying to allow PKing in the SBQ fight to shoot out people you don’t like. This is exactly why this “bug” exists. So no, absolutely not.
---
In the last 3 days, i have played about 16 hours with no disconnects,crashes,etc. But then i have good internet.
---
PS4
---
I haven’t seen any reason to believe it is bugged. They didn’t intend for wanted to be fair.
---
Fawkes Landersaka: Faulksthadead aka: The Music Man: Born before the vaults this young man was always what society called a black sheep and it didn’t change in the vault either. But darker things lurked inside this one.  And the day the bombs dropped  it fully awoke. The Father had come to the wastes and taken hold in his first subject instilling all the corruption and decay The Father has to offer..sins that man created..a twisted warped reality that would never let him go. The day the vault actually opened couldn’t be soon enough for him.  Even though he had gotten in a vault by killing another young gentleman things just never went right in the vault. He spent most of his time in the hole as the overseer called it.  Years of being a caged animal he could now roam free...you think those animals created by radiation are scary? You haven’t seen scary yet..it wasn’t till weeks down the line he would find such a simple archaic device that would mold him into what you see today..The Music Man..guess ipods will outlive you all...
---
OT : why did you wrote the title like that ?
---
I agree and why i use it as well even a tad worried but i am at the point i want it and its just QOL stuff.
---
When combined with explosive effect (and demo expert and whatever weapon dmg perks) you're still gonna be one shotting most enemies.
---
For automatic guns, heavy guns, semi auto guns, you're only gonna notice a slight drop in your time to kill.
---
The only weapons you could argue that get screwed in this deal would be slow firing weapons.
---
zzzz
---
GhoulKiller Gamma Gun.
---
I see. My endurance is....2. ha
---
Events would be a cluster if people could troll them. Just stop being wanted if you want to do them.
---
Maybe custom voice chat channels...or a text chat only for this area.
---
Area chat wouldn't work with that many voices.
---
It's not overshadowed by much, just 2 shot. It's a flat damage increase compared to Junkie's, Bloodied, or Berserker. Am I missing any of the other damage increased legendary effects on the same tier?
---
Because you have too many noobs showing up at the SBQ event, her health scales based on how many people are there and im pretty sure she regens when more people show up. 
---
45% aoe damage at that. That is still badass.
---
I mainly think we should be able to use something else than plastic to craft those ammos.
---
I mean a lot of games have some sort of dual wield guns. Reloading takes a little longer if both are empty. Ideally it would be similar to Skyrim dual wielding melee.  
---
Pretty bad when Two shot basically does that or the aiming legendary effect. If t so-called with mutations it would be very good but it’s basically 10% damage in comparison to:
---
-Instigating: double damage
---
-Explosive: an extra attack that is 20% (it’s a secondary perk which shouldn’t be better than a first prefix perk)
---
- two shot: (I know they nerfed it but overall does more damage)
---
-Junkies: don’t know the damage variables but probably is better than 10%
---
Bloodied: No contest
---
I did it sometime since the last patch and it was all empty too. Including the “priority boxes”
---
Looks like Bottlecap glasses.
---
and im sure the whole bloodied build is gonna get nerfed next, with that dude that posted his build that does 6k damage against the queen im pretty sure thats NOT intended. 
---
Not applicable to the comment chain I'm responding to. He wants content over nerfs. I responded that nerfs are easy and quick.
---
Upvote for you (awesome gallery!) and your relationship (I wish my wife was a gamer).  
---
upon hitting new targets it resets. 
---
Bro. I don’t know how people use explosives anyways. I had a level 30 rocket launcher and shot a level 15 super mutant 5 times before I switched to my one shot rifle and killed him. Haven’t played since 
---
\&gt; I don't think it's really fair to those of us that grinded days and days to get a good gun.    
---
fuck you  
---
Another valid question downvoted to 0, Reddit at its finest, social media toxicity smh
---
Have an upvote.
---
There’s a holotape inside the train explaining that it’s an interdimensional transport for moving around in time. It’s also a great place to grab a new mutation. 
---
It's not about PvP. It's about throwing away every weapon you find unless it has one of those mods. I rarely play anymore because the odds of finding something wearable through regular gameplay are so very low, and TSE added to that feeling considerably.
---
Sorry. I should have worded it different. The reason I replied to you was showing that not everyone who owns a TSE is upset over the nerf. I agree I am too OP right now
---
I got calibrated shocks on both legs, took a while, but got them much sooner than the X-01 shocks.
---
Looking at the comment history, this guy is the fun police.  Troll.
---
“It’s not my fault, it’s everyone else’s fault.”
---
OFC , not everyone. But vast majority.
---
I think once you rank up a card to max you should be able to equip it at any level. So you select it and then select the level yu want equipped
---
It's when the two are together. I have an explosive weapon and it's not really all that powerful by itself. It's also hard to use close quaters because the explosive splash will hurt and you better be wearing PA. Everyone saying Explosive is the problem. I don't think so. I think two shot AND explosive on the same weapon is OP. It's like a 400% damage buff. Either of these effects by themselves isn't that bad though. Decreasing two shot mitigates the problem on TSE weapons but sucks for anyone with JUST a TS. 
---
Fair enough on the nerf to two shot I guess, but can we at least get the vats accuracy fixed? It's infuriating how innacurate those weapons are.
---
I'm talking about the explosive prefix on legendaries.  
---
eh ?
---
True, but the point still remains,  they are OP as hell and need a nerf. I was showing that even some TSE users know this
---
What is this.  Saltout 76?
---
Level 45 for maybe 300 caps or less depending on CHA and Hard Bargain.
---
It is just looking at max literal hp, not rad-capped hp.  I suspect it is working as designed.
---
Did they nerfed it? Feels the same to me.
---
Tell me more lol, i had no idea there was pros and cons for wearing it. Ill have to research it
---
I thought lobotomies were illegal?
---
Where was the fun and how was it policed ?
---
Thats been my question about all these TSE crybabies... I'm just trying make a point.
---
I posted this a few weeks ago in a comment and got downvoted lol.
---
To prevent any overlapping of vending machines, the easiest way would be for a set number (server capacity) to be placed permanently and each player gets assigned one when they join a world.
---
Having the new V76 unlock around lvl 25 (even 10-15) would be appropriate, as it gives a place for people to sell low level legendaries to each other.
---
the plans yes, the mods not so much.
---
I'm currently running the same build right now. Got a suppressed something else lever action rifle doing 141 damage with perks and a vampire's Gauss rifle hitting for about 238.
---
Tormentor in Luck is worth having too. you get extra chance to cripple limbs with that.
---
One piece of chameleon Armour is enough as it doesn't stack but like Darthtalon said, its worth having 2 in case one breaks so you still have the effect active.
---
All these "review" videos I've seen has just reinforced the belief that no ones opinion matters, because its all subjective.
---
Nobody complained about bloodied because it took some effort to setup. Unlike tse
---
You have to be specced for it to be effective, same as your rifle shooting. You have the perks and custom modded equipment to your play style. 
---
Oh right, I was half asleep when I read it.
---
In that case, OP, not sure why but melee not in rad suits/power armor gets radiated heaps when she lands for w/e reason. Don't have this issue with the normal placement. Super awkward firing for ranged too. 
---
That’s up to them. I’d like to point out that thread made the rest of the Warframe reddit very hostile to people with valid concerns and tended to simply shove them away to a place nobody looked at. So I personally think it’s not a great idea.
---
I agree with just about all of this. Accept the 100 shared weight between characters on the same account. Simply, it would be abused, and everyone would use it to make mules. I know, they already do, but that at least requires time to transfer items. And if you don't have any ingame friends, then it takes time. 
---
I like the stash limit, and I don't want to see it bypassed. I do think that the stash limit needs to be increased. Not sure if it should be quest related, and if it is, the end shouldn't be the queen. 
---
I think Intelligence should have more effect on crafting than just a longer durability bar. What if it also affected the base damage of the weapon? What if the bonus crafted food gave was bigger? What if my ribeye steaks made with a 15+ intelligence gave 30 pounds of increased carry? 
---
What if my chems lasted 20% longer? And maybe it's not just always tied to intelligence. Perception could play a part. 
---
I'd also like to see the ability to make items with some of the legendary effects on them. And then less legendaries in the game. I would really love to see a game where crafting is really a vital and important part of the game. Then people can choose, am I crafter, or am I a warrior? How am rebuilding Appalachia?   
---
I'd like to see the cooking revamped. I know, that's a lot. But I think it's not that far fetched. Why do I need so many tea recipes? What if for something like Appalachilli, I could use any meat? And using a different meat gives different or better bonus?
---
I'd also like to see the ability to can and jar food. Which would increase the weight, but also increase the life of the food. You could find a recipe for say, Canned Appalachilli, The same. only you also need a can and 1 steel scrap. Bam, one can of Appalachilli. Same with things like tea. You need a mason jar with a lid. 
---
I like that there are some craftables that need actual items over resources. I'd like to see more. I could easily see part of the economy being low level players collecting the cans and jars to sell to other players. 1 cap per ten cans. 1 cap per 5 mason jars with lids. 
---
Not going to lie, it does sound interesting. At this point, I don't have the time to PvP but at one point I did. More so BGs than arenas, but I did those as well. Wasn't the best nor the worst, but did have a lot of fun. I would say it really broke down to having good people to play it with. Nowadays, I don't know many people that play let alone to PVP. I get that from FPS now instead since there is a seemingly less time investment with more carryover skills between games. 
---
But I would try that server, the only part I wouldn't like, is as you had said. 
---
So from what I understand this is what they did
---
They nerfed two shot to 25% from 100%
---
For explosive they only nerfed the splash damage to 20% from 100%  so direct hits will register for explosive damage.
---
Following the lore this is impossible. If you read the terminal inside the vault you know that after a certain time the air inside the vault was removed in order to be sure that everyone was out of there. This to prevent people to stay eternally in the vault (seems that staying in the vault with all those amenities may cause addiction).
---
Its salad tho....
---
TSE are super rare if you dont cheat so it's equally as difficult to get. Setting up a bloodied build,took me 20 min. Wasnt much effort
---
I do unarmed build so: First and foremost the Damage perks for whatever you use 1h/2h/u as many points as you can spare. Twisted Muscle Mutation, and Talons mutation are big damage buffs. Adrenaline Agility Perk is a huge factor. Bloody Mess for another 15% damage. I always eat Glowing meat steaks for 10% melee bonus. Use  **Weapon Artisan** to always repair to 200% the extra durability boosts damage. Incisor perk is great! I also have 15 natural STR and Its buffed +2 from legendary armor rn but could be much higher if I swapped.   
---
After that just look for good legendary effects that compliment your build.
---
"jumping in front of everyone" = you need to be in melee range to...melee. Stop jumping behind melee builds with your ranged build.
---
What is this need mod you speak of?? Any good? 
---
Was removed probably because he was selling is  Dev room items for real money
---
It didn't read that way for me but that wohld be better if its true.
---
I didn't say it was a lot of effort 
---
I don't have the mods, I have the plans for them
---
Read the edit before you comment 
---
they should set the flag on character creation. none of this flag in a menu shit i can change while talking to you. 
---
You could be right, I never saw any hints of that myself but I might have missed them.
---
That being said, shutdown or not all that technology is still there, it's a shame to waste it.
---
Well my character is a sniper who relies on sneaking so luck wasn’t as important. 
---
Besides, the fact that legendaries were dropping from normal ghouls should scream that this isn’t normal.
---
GT Pokechamp5611 Ill see if I can trade items over caps if that is possible. If not Ill take one of the mole miner gauntlets for my unarmed build
---
Picked up a Furious Explosive 10mm SMG last night. Guess that's replacing my TSE Handmade....
---
Thank the dupers because they have caused this by duping a shed load of them. 
---
Right, it takes more effort to get a TSE than it does to set up a bloodied of you play legit.
---
&gt;because I don't believe that people who built their Characters as Riflemen and Shotgunners would complain about the Damage they can do when all the right Perk Cards are loaded
---
You wold be wrong, sir.
---
People's builds only suck compared to other players. Besides, there are some build combinations that will never stack up to the melee builds so that means melee IS op. 
---
I have a TSE double barrel that does 1475 damage, and have a friend whose BSS mole miner's gauntlet gets her to 1900. It doesn't matter in pve or even much pvp because at a certain point damage is just dick measuring.
---
However, after the nerf this means BSS users will still be one-shotting things while TSE players will be left in the dust
---
you are going to see a better result from the armor piercing the better the armor i'd imagine. should have made lvl 50 metal armor maybe
---
I think i only have the +2 Str on chest plans for Exc.
---
But what if it’s not combined with explosive effects? I have two TS weapons I use. One star each, no explosive effects. I never one shot any enemy I encounter (not a sneak build). Idk, it just seems like a slight disappointment.
---
People that want to max out damage dont care about playing legit
---
I’ve stated this same thing. They’re nerfing TSE. They better nerf bloodied. Otherwise you’re moving back to melee being the only class that is worth playing for quick kills. 
---
And my comment is to state that if Bethesda focused on necessary buffs and positive changes, than people would be less annoyed by the constant nerfs each patch. 
---
That is the idea. To play the game and enjoy it. The fact some people are making it to where you literally have to block their gamertag cause they want to be little assholes is ridiculous. I am going to enjoy my game whether I am doing missions or events or hunting down Griefers, I will enjoy my time. And some times you need only give someone a taste of their own medicine for them to realize being a asshole when you have people to protect you isn't always the best option, Cause you will be alone eventually. 😂👍
---
So it’s a very easy damage boost to get and maintain. That’s why the effect is low. Two shot has penalties, explosive is LOLOP, bloodied only is better if you are at low HP, junkies requires you eat debuffs.
---
I'm not against scrapping ammo. But you logic was this.
---
With TS and E being lowered, people are going to be using more ammo. So let us scrap all this excess ammo we have. 
---
Wouldn't having so much excessive ammo mean that having to fire your TSE weapons a few extra times not really be a problem? 
---
I get that you mean all the other ammo you have, not the ammo you need. But with being able to find ammo all over the place and make it having ammo seldom seems a problem. 
---
Keep the day job.
---
My interpretation of what his title sounds like.
---
exactly, you may have to server switch, but it's not that rare
---
&gt; EDIT: I meant "Nerf" in the title. 
---
Didn't you get it right the first time? 
---
Who else works in game dev companies other than nerds? Of course you want a nerd on all bloodied weapons if you want something done about them! :)
---
What are dev room items? I am fine with real money but are they not real or something? Sorry not understanding.
---
How are you getting 20 rounds for Drum and 12 for Stinging on a Combat Shotgun?  Drum adds 50% of weapon base capacity for 12 rounds and stinging adds 25% of base for 10.  They changed how it worked from Fallout 4 where its % of base vs FO4's fixed amount being added.  
---
I have a Quad Combat Shotgun that's 32 round magazine, 36 with drum mag since it only modifies it based on the weapon's base capacity sans Legendary modifiers.
---
its an execution and prevents them from being rezzed. 
---
Glad someone pointed it out before I did. Dude is definitely a duper.
---
So then why are those of us who are legit beinf punished for thise who are not? My point stands, if they think that the 3000 damage of the better TSEs were too much then bloodied needs to be capped as well.
---
Eye for an eye and we will soon live in the land of the blind....
---
It’s easier to find a bloodied 2h with swing speed than it is a TSE gun. Not to mention it does twice the damage end game. They’re floating all over the market. 
---
Lol. 
---
That wasn't my question, was about caps
---
&gt; bloodied needs to be capped as well.
---
I'm sure it will
---
which is a shame, Im 99% sure that this game was supposed to be released mid 2019, but they needed to get in the last quarter. I mean it would make sense how the no nuke bug happened, I imagine some coop or intern was tasked with coding the weekly reset timer for the nukes hard coded 2019 into it so when it rolled over it bugged it out.
---
Thank you for saying what needed to be said.
---
Same reason why you wrote Rocket Suit in one word.
---
I agree this nerf alone doesn't help overall balance, there needs to be more nerfs/buffs across many different weapon types. But I'm looking at it as a step in the right direction.
---
I doubt it. Bethesda only listens when enough kids pull their thumb out of their mouth and start screaming in unison.
---
Sounds about right!
---
cant you just sell stuff you make in workshops for caps? i can sell food i make in the little factory 
---
But one thing that is very cool about Warframe is that their is a dedicated forum hosted by DE themselves and you can see Rebecca answering questions all the time. For instance just a day or so ago she responded to a very rude response from an angry gamer. They are always out there. The reddit thread is more or less a way to get things off your chest as a community. It's not about getting it back to DE or Bethesda. They have most likely heard it already. As a psychology minor it's really good to talk about things and find a way to vent frustrations. That's why I suggested it. I see everyday some disgruntled 76 player and I think we all deserve a place to vent freely with some rules such as civility and respect. But please if the game bothers you in a way just vent it here in the thread, rather than in general area. Valid bugs and such should def be posted directly to Bethesda forums and to Bethesda email. 
---
Clearly not
---
I know. 
---
Which is why they need to change the SBQ asap. 
---
Make it so that low levels do not change her stats. Or prevent low levels from taking part in the quest at all, if that is how Bethesda want the end game content to be played. 
---
Also, make the fight give better loot on each kill (no more drills and ammunition and that is it). 
---
Maybe give SBQ tokens/medals that can be exchanged for end game loot/plans so even if you get nothing from her, you still get a step closer to something. 
---
Also, make the fight include objectives to make it interesting (repair an artillery sheller that can blow off a wing for example). 
---
The current state of the SBQ is ridiculous. 
---
Nerfing TSE weapons (although must be done) will just make the SBQ (the ONLY end game content) even worse! 
---
&gt;-Messenger escort event is just terrible. He gets stuck all the time. Escort missions in general are just bad.
---
Two or three times now I have seen the Messenger run into flames and got stuck in a unstoppable loop of dying over and over.
---
True but you can’t balance a game by nerfing guns to make playing that build obsolete. The point in balancing is to make everyone fair across the board. Given there is always going to be those high dmg players. You can’t nerf one side and not the other. Now the balance goes from melee and range to melee again. 
---
whoosh ?
---
And people have been, if you read posts about the tse nerf most people complain about bloodied. And you know how people like screaming about the same problems over and over 
---
Whatever floats your boat
---
You can get the plans for the armor itself from an event, you can get plans for mods from treasure maps in the ash heap.
---
That's player with player trade though and no gambling is involved. Not to mention that if get caught you'll be banned, since it's against the ToS.
---
it was, but then people used it as a greetings
---
Feed the People or Die.
---
&gt; If not TSE Weapons, what are good alternatives to make a Level 70 character be able to fight Level 70 Enemies? 
---
Pick any high tier modded weapon, let alone one with legendary effects. Just takes a little more effort. Maybe some tactics too if you're smart.
---
That doesn't even account for the number of melee options you have. It's not THAT hard.
---
If you look in the build menu at the turrets, you'll see a shield with the defense # next to it.. that is "generally" the strength of the turret type. The heavy lasers will do decent, except against enemies that have a strong energy resistance. Shotgun turrets are great for close-up enemies. you may just have to play around
---
Try taking that off if you are spawning into power armor like i usually do. 
---
Are you implying it was bait?
---
I also like challenging events, but I think Bethesda has to be careful with failure. If events are too likely to fail, solo players stop going to them, making them more likely to fail. It also feels bad if the failure is bugged (e.g. last scorched is hidden in a wall). 
---
Meh, i wouldn’t say takes for ever.  My vat crit build can easily kill a lvl 68 in 2-3 shots.  
---
They should have just made explosive a primary.  
---
This is the classic nerf/buff game done by online game devs to keep things fresh, drama, people making new builds, when there is no real new content.
---
Maybe that’s what it was. I have a AA Radium with 25% faster fire rate and 25% less VATS that works just as well if not better against these type of players even though the damage would appear weak (75 ballistic and 15 radiation). The fire rate is 98, it’s a bullet hose for a rifle.
---
So they are using Dodgy? I’m not that familiar with this although he did mention mention something about it and “breaking hit detection”. So I guess the answer is a fast firing weapon. He did kill me 2 to 1 when he switched to a TSE shotgun though. I didn’t have fireproof on, forgot to switch, so that was my mistake 
---
I am so glad TSE is getting nerfed. I wasn’t looking forward to everyone running around spraying and praying with a TSE shotgun
---
Double damage, half accuracy.  Have you ever used a non-explosive two-shot weapon?  They are horribly inaccurate.  Two-shot weapons are insanely powerful when combined with explosive bullets because then they don't have to be accurate. 
---
15-19
---
Can't blame her. Fresh low level players are the tastest.
---
I was actually thinking of them meeting outside or in the area around the vault commonly as it would now be a regularly visited area.
---
You'll have to figure it out i guess
---
PC. 
---
Not important just voicing a complaint. 
---
How do you think it is remotely fair to take a a very rare TSE weapon (it's not the legit players fault that you couldn't stop a well known dupe exploit) that alot of us spent months farming and turn it into a wett noodle when we couldn't even hold onto other weapons incase something like this nerf happens? Just so the broken PvP that no one plays can still be a one shot game? Any decent build max level kills other players in max 3 hits and most in one without a TSE. The better solution would be to make us only hit for 10-20% of weapon damage across the board in PvP. Now the only build that will not have you wondering if your shooting rubber bullets in pve will be melee and some players including myself can not stand it. Will you atleast give us a free re spec for our toons since your breaking our toons? If I have to start over to be able to play I will no longer be playing the game. This is honestly sickening after spending so much time grinding my weapon and having it be the only weapon effect that makes a rifle build worth play. I have been one of the few defending this game and I was about to buy 2 friends both a copy to get them to play and give the game a chance after all the bad press. I love fallout but I'm sad to say if my entire toon becomes useless after this I will have to stop playing and jump on the hate 76 bandwagon for the first time. Remember your game is fallout 76 please don't destroy a primarily pve game by trying to make it fortnite 76. Thank you for reading if you do.
---
A non legendary hand made rifle works just fine.
---
I would really like even a few cosmetic items, like a plates of food, cases of nuka cola, books, tools and other stuff we can put on top of tables.
---
In my camp kitchen I have a small prep table next to the cooking stove that would look great with a half sliced tato or a piece of meat and a knife.  A bottle of nuka cola and a plate of food would be awesome for the dining table.
---
Gun racks would be very nice, and also armor stands.  Setting up an armory room (that people can't loot for obvious reasons) would be excellent.
---
Humans lived in caves for millennia.  Brought all those things with them.
---
It goes beyond nerfing melee because melee is easy to do with the enemy AI. Case in point: I ran into 2 Scorchbeasts and a Behemoth last night at once. Was able to take them all out using melee. Why?  Not because I’m super powered. I was using a Grognak Ax with the 3 base two-hand perks (so 30%) damage, wearing Excavator PA. I’m level 70 with 15 strength. Was able to do it because they all just stand there and let you beat on them. Took multiple hits to do, but if I can wail on all of those enemies and come out on top, well that’s a matter of AI really. 
---
Stalking Mothman won’t attack. Vengeful Mothman will fuck your shit up post haste. 
---
Yeah. I have a 2* furious lever action but my 1* two shot lever always did slightly more damage and to me seemed like a better gun to carry around as a level 120. Still used a good amount of bullets. I hope you’re right, but I still wish they stepped in a different direction. Glad I held on to other guns I found, though, so TS isn’t a I have.
---
My impression is that a 1 or 2 point difference isn't noticeable, but the differences between charisma 3 and 9 are apparent. That said, I haven't done a data analysis, which is really needed for this sort of question. 
---
All bloodied users are nerds already ;D
---
Had this once, it just stood there until the even failed and then de-spawned.Bug.
---
As long as the explosive legendary effect still benefits from Demo Expert, that shit will still be very strong.
---
This is a really good idea because now that two shot is nerfed a lot of the higher-level content is just going to be bullet sponges.  I shouldn't have to shoot a regular super mutant in the head 10 * to kill it.  I think a little bit given back on two shot and this kind of crafting might be the balance we need.
---
Arite, i'll check next time i go there.
---
I get your reasons, I just don’t think it’ll work for FO76. And you didn’t speak to my point about what it does to valid concerns at Warframe. Why do I need to go to a completely different place just to report problems? The Warframe community is very hostile to concerns, let’s not become like that here.
---
That’s a good thing. Especially for legit players
---
Stalking Mothman just like to watch. Vengeful Mothman will scream your face off your torso. 
---
I havent seen that nut maybe youre right, Idk.
---
Depends on the 2-shot though... it's a problem for a handmade, it's not so much of a problem for a gatling or .50 cal. It also doesn't affect you anywhere near as much if you ADS rather than hipfire. It \_does\_ screw VATS shots which I definitely agree should be fixed to count as at least ADS shots since you can't ADS &amp; VATS.
---
Lol. Typos that cant be corrected because titles cant be edited...
---
If someone can't tell that this was sarcasm, then even if I wrote sarcasm out in bold all caps they still wouldn't have gotten the message.
---
They have some Red Rocket's 
---
Ive seen sneak build do OP damage and I’ve seen Melee do OP damage. TSE nerf is not the way forward when that all still exists, its just the fact Bethesda could sort the PVP side out this has happened. Why don’t they sort end game out instead of nerfing weapons, or fix energy weapons or do something useful and make other places worth nuking. 
---
Dev room items are illegal in the game and just for having one item from the dev room in your inventory can result in a ban.
---
Only quantum has a radioactive isotope in it. Why do you think it glows in the dark?

They’re basically leaked items that aren’t allowed to be sold.

Runaway train never going back
---
Wrong way on a one way track
---
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
---
Somehow I'm neither here nor there
---
Upvoted. I agree with both of you. 
---
Personally I think level 3 safes are way better than the master locked containers in 4. In 4 I never once got anything memorable. In 76 I’ve found an auto grenade launcher (first one for this character), a Gauss rifle, MG42 plans, and plenty of 40mm grenades which I use all the time. 
---
Nothing earth shattering, but good enough that I actually pick the locks whereas in 4 I stopped bothering entirely after a while.
---
Id like to be able to grind up unneeded cards for atoms. Give high level players another means of getting atoms and let's me get my deck under control. 
---
After I made that post, not before.
---
&gt;1200+ Damage 
---
with 75-100% armour penetration
---
If you were afk and unable to engage, why did you lose caps? We're you already wanted? I wasn't aware one could lose caps from dying unless it was from having a bounty.
---
You sound like an asshole honestly, even if I agree with your main points, the way you put them is childish and condescending. Congrats, Kid!
---
Just switch to a bloodied melee build and you can carry on 1 shotting things
---
You know you can have BOTH a nerf to TSE as well as potential balance changes of mobs with other weapons are too bullet spongy.
---
"camp objects" fyi
---
Naw bro, you see cross eyed, then. It's not necessarily a nerd happy developer, they're tryna fix the dupes they let populate through the world. 
---
What site is that?
---
You are right, fun was never a part of this game and/or subreddit.
---
Disable fast travel... mwhahaga
---
Comment to revisit, thank you for your work.  
---
They ruined the game? You are sadly mistake, just like these other little bitches here.
---
The sweaty neck beard cheating ass fuck faces TRIED to ruin the game by flooding the game with OP guns. Now we are getting a fix so when people do PvP it will require some skill instead of a damn 16 year old running around hosing people with a OP no skill TSE shotgun.
---
I can’t wait. Fucking these players up will be top priority. 
---
Yeah that key will be revoked, a few days later you will be crying here.Stop with the gray market advertising here.Of course the shills will come to post how they "bought hundreds of games there" and it's safe, but it's not.
---
That's not how two shot works. Two shot adds one extra projectile to the spread, so like 8 pellets becomes 9.
---
If you got hit with 4 double barrel shots, then the gun had the double or quad affix.
---
I have a spotlight and they still don’t do anything, I don’t know if I need a bunch of spotlights or what I have a spotlight a missile turret, 2 heavy laser, 2 heavy machine gun, and they take forever to even kill a pack of wolves 
---
Sure you do.
---
Againt people in pacifist.
---
Maybe stop griefing people and fight someone not in pacifist lol. Noob has to pick on people that don't want to fight hahaha. 
---
You know Rule 9? That.
---
You seen the forums, man? That's all people are doing about melee
---
I guess I don't have any two shot weapons so that's why it doesn't bother me as much.
---
I just think when you see one prevalent type of weapon (tse) that everyone relies on, that means there is bad balance.
---
I'd like to see an explosive *legendary prefix* nerf, two handed melee nerf, with a buff to laser weapons, the lmg, maybe to some other legendary prefixes, etc.
---
That way there's more viable options. As it stands now, the meta is too powerful.
---
Yeah, I couldn't mod at all in F4 without everything coming to a crashing halt.
---
I like the idea.  If it applied, it would also make Scrapper perk (int) much more useful.
---
I tend to pick up 5mm, shotgun and .50 ammo when I find it, and dump in the blue suitcase at the Watoga Station, or just on the ground if there's other players there scrapping, crafting or vendoring.  It doesn't weigh very much, so it's really not an inconvenience to grab it.  I know that other players use a lot of those with popular weapons (I use .45 and 5.56 myself) so even if I just leave a couple dozen, I'm sure it's appreciated.  I appreciate finding a handful of 5.56 in someone else's doggie bag.
---
Don't
---
Use any full modded max lvl two shot weapon + 9lvls of weapon type specific perk cards + blood mess lvl 3 + adrenaline lvl 5 + tenderizer lvl 3 + any psycho chem. 
---
Is the two shot/explosive nerf retroactive?
---
Bethesda has shown their true colors and intent with this latest news: 
---
 \&gt; ***the rules of PvP as they currently are in the game are not changing outside of the new mode.*** 
---
This is basically a huge 'fuck you' to the PvE players.  All the griefing, ganking, harassing and camp destruction will remain as before. 
---
Is that a legit site? I would be scared to buy from somewhere that is $30 less than everyone else
---
I’m also melee so always up close getting hit by alot if your sneak sniper or something your durability would last a longer 
---
It's bullshit then.  If someone attacks you while you are wanted then you can at least defend yourself if you're not just being one shotted like you usually are.  If someone attacks you during the event then you're never given the ability to defend yourself.  Your options are either die or somehow leave the event while also getting shot at.  Good luck trying to leave Uranium Fever midway through while someone chases you down if they decide to take your bounty.  There's nothing you can do.
---
Of course not, what do you think.
---
Maybe I just missed them then.
---
I have to say I agree there. All they’re managing to do at this point is divide the community. And once they start doing big changes without content they’re going to lose customers and they’ll kill their own game. It’s still going to be overran by the guys using insane amounts of bobble heads. They can’t get a grasp on the duping glitches. This is what is slowly killing the community. So reduce the damage of some of the best items by 75%? Because you can’t fix your own game? Melee will be next. Then the community will either go up in arms or will dissipate. It’s going to hit a point where dlc will not even be enough to bring back the community at this rate. 
---
Building ur base at the club is frowned on. If u are on reddit enough, people destroy those bases. Its not griefing 
---
I personally think fast travel to events should always be free
---
I agree with you, there's even a boarded up station. I believe it's supposed to point to the Free States' isolationism. Even the actual vendor in Harper's Ferry is a bit hidden. Personally to me it's a bit annoying haha
---
That's true.  I never use big guns, so I didn't think about how much powerful that would make them.  I just remember finding a two shot lever action and quickly being disappointed with it since it was practically useless in VATS.  
---
The only two-shot weapon I use now is a TSE prime combat shotgun for up-close encounters with large radiated bats. 
---
Well it's prolly not gonna be that bad with a TSE or Bloodied/Instigating-Exp weapon but anything less than that prolly gonna suck big time. I'm leveling a new toon right now and my memory is kinda fresh so i gotta say i don't miss bullet sponge enemies one bit. That said TSE weapons needed an ajustment but so are many other things. Yes they overperofrm right now. They overperform in every scenario except scorbeast fights and sbq fights. These are long, boring and not worth the trouble without 1k+ damage weapons.
---
Balance is balance. They’re not doing it to “make” new content, that is preposterous. Your argument boils down to “don’t nerf my OP thing cause I like it.”
---
I haven’t played melee long but so far I tear through mobs. Incisor was the point that made it. So I think the only issue is that. Otherwise, melee should have high damage due to risk. But if so, so should shotguns. Why don’t those have an anti armor perk? Silly.
---
If it’s OP it gets a nerf, it’s that simple. It isn’t “nerfing” it’s balance.
---
I understand where you are coming from and I think the reason for that, is that Warframe deserves to be defended at this point. They are doing so many things right that is why you will find people who seem to be hostile. They are defending something they love. 76 has those people as well. I was originally one of the people that defended 76. But the state it is in right now is unacceptable for me. That being said to further address when you have a valid issue in Warframe you can directly speak to a rep very easily. There is a tab in game to directly link you to a rep and you'll get an email back very quickly. Bethesda needs to get it together in that respect. The lack of information and the constantly fixing something while breaking another needs to be addressed as well. I've got a thread personally with Bethesda support team that is going on 100 replies back and forth trying to fix my problems. 
---
so fresh when they just came out of the vault
---
Damage mitigation perks really don’t do anything tbh I’d say if your building a glass cannon like those people who use bloody and permanently run with only like 30% of their hp should all be able to be one shot but if I’m trying to build my character as a tank it sucks that so many things can one shot 
---
I think OP might have been confusing with the directions. If you read the rest, and look at where Forward Station Delta is, he must mean to nuke Northwest of Prime. He said he was used to pulling SBQ to Glass Caverns, which is North, suggesting that people usually nuke South of Prime. He should have included a picture. :|
---
Looks like G2A, just wondering if it's a legit site and Bethesda has taken that big of a hit with the game..or if it's stolen keys and that's why it's so cheap.
---
Two-Shot and Explosive both need to be nerfed.  With the proposed plan they still get +50% damage, rather than +200% damage and a massive explosion radius.  These weapons are currently way too powerful, which is why you have people grinding for over 100 hours trying to loot a two-shot explosive.  These weapons need to be brought down a massive notch to be more on par with the rest of the weapons.
---
Can you tell me more about this? I got an anti armor assault rifle yesterday and was trying to figure what mods to use.
---
Well maybe they should break down the few guns that are OP and give the owners a one time re-roll.
---
Seems a better option than to ruin every gun in the game.
---
If you spend all if your time at the golf club I can understand how annoying that guy with the TSE shotgun can be, but there is more to this game than that. As a solo player who spends 90%of his time exploring the wasteland solo......duped guns have pretty much no effect on my experience.
---
When you're saying which hunt do you mean are accused of abusing a glitch or issue? Do you mean scapegoating? 
---
I don't know what which hunting and bobbleheads have to do with each other. I understand there's the stacking issue but who are you saying is witchich hunting? Who are the witches? Who are the hunters? 
---
You're critiquing the discourse here but I'm not understanding what it is you're saying is the matter. 
---
I get witch hunting when it comes to dupers and people with tses getting called dupers but I dont get what you're trying to say otherwise m feel free to give up on me as I'm not too worried about it 
---
Short answer - melee.
---
Slightly longer explanation - Try to get your hands on a bloodied super sledge, max out str, 2h perks, martial artist, Glow sight, Radicool, lone wanderer (if solo) party boy/girl, Nerd rage, Serendipity.  Rad yourself down to around 30% health to keep serendipity proccing and nerd rage when down less that that.  Wear power armour of choice.  Swing away and feel the OP'dness
---
I would switch characters and hunt them for eternity, or at least till they blocked me.
---
Excellent idea!
---
I'm hoping that once the TSE balance change goes into effect, that they look into combat balance overall. Make things not so crazily bullet spongy.
---
I love that there are bastions of the old world in all of these games. It really is like taking a break, especially the institute. I was upset there wasn't an option to save it up but to clear everyone out. 
---
I have seen her fly out of bounds, underground, forget how to fly, never land.  She is bat-Sh\*t crazy.
---
Shouldn't you be in school or something?
---
Or just die to lose the bounty and come back and do the event. It’s not hard. You’ll make way more caps than you lose if it was just some accidental bounty.
---
It’s great to read these reactions
---
YES. This is what I've wanted and been saying even before the confirmation of PvP servers. 
---
From time to time a shill from that site will post here and then defend it from a few other accounts.It's all grey market at best, if something is too cheap to be true, it's not.
---
Yes, and I’m aware of the tradeoff. ADS allows you to almost always deal double damage.
---
Being "worth" over 200 doesnt mean anything when we are talking about what the merchant will buy things for. I'm know plans can be bought from the merchant for more but they wont buy them for that same amount (if they ever make it so they'll buy them at all)
---
Ive always sold my shit first and then bought so I never saw the hard cap limit and havent tested it. That sucks. Its hard enough selling shit idk why they do that.
---
While we are on the subject of not buying my shit though... Why will they buy antibiotics but not disease cure? Why don't they buy ammo?? Also sucks.
---
I get where you guys are coming from when you suggest these things, but I think you're overdoing it.   It's like you want the devs to hand you great shit for everything you do.   
---
Every game I've played with random loot has had instances where you do a big thing and got crap loot.   That's part of the game and the challenge since it's multi-player.   If you just get TSE weapons every time, what's the point?  Good loot needs to be rare.   
---
In my mind, I'm always going back to Diablo 2 to compare.  It had crap loot quite often, very limited storage, and it was challenging as hell but so fun, too.   I feel a lot of these requests would suck the challenge from the game.   
---
I think a lot of players would never discover how to trigger these events without indicators or community help. That would make it more rewarding to discover new events and trigger them and see the community come together because of something you did.
---
That said, it would require some reworking of the events to give a bit more story to them (Looking at YOU, Mongrel Horde). You would also hit the same complaint with people just joining the server as the event is ending. So I would still like to see a timer in the popup when I scroll over it.
---
Overall, I really like your suggestion because it has the potential to bind the community more.
---
Bloodied = high risk high reward. TS = no risk high reward.
---
Simple enough?
---
That isn’t really a good reason to be hostile when someone is honestly presenting their ideas/speaking up.
---
Sooooooooooooooo much this.   Why do I bother building empty bookshelves, display racks, etc if I can't put anything on them!!  I started collecting every unique teddy bear I could a while back and wound up scrapping them because I realized they're useless :(
---
Live some more and learn, you'll see.
---
That's funny, because I personally feel the exact opposite. My first character that got to endgame, I retired him pretty damn quick. That shit got so boring for me.
---
I've always had the worse case of restartitis in Bethesda games, and I'm on my 5th character reroll since beta. I enjoy the early game struggle the most.
---
I, for one, am glad they're nerfing it. I've been looking for a reason to start my RDR2 play-through.
---
i just ran in to this for the first time in 3 weeks. I unfortunately logged in to 5 different servers and saw 5 different CAMPs in my spot :/ I know this is minimal compared to other things going on but when you have a set time to play and you spend 30 mins of it re-logging due to location and server reboots or rollbacks its hard to want to play the next day.
---
They should probably just remove weapons altogether. Make this Sims online. No weapons means no armor. No armor means we don't need aids either. Just food and water. 
---
Purple haze, A.K.A the "Hendrix" effect.
---
For the way this game is designed, boring.
---
Twisted muscle = +25% melee damage and + chance to cripple
---
Adrenal reaction  = lower your health goes the higher your damage goes
---
Focus succesfully moved from new content requests. Masterfully done, Bethesda.
---
Well I know what Im doing tonight thanks
---
Dont downvote the dude hes right. There is a stash in the resort already.
---
Oh no, you've gone and done it.
---
You've just flagged a G2A rep who will undoubtly tell you that they don't have stolen keys, even though Totalbiscuit build up an extensive file of alleged evidence enough that Gearbox turned their back on a deal with G2A.
---
I have run a bloodied build. When wearing the unyielding ser that most bloddied people do their is virtually no risk. I sat there hitting the queen at 20% health for then entire fight and never died. 
---
Bloodied build = Invincible God
---
Simple Enough?
---
Lol got a tier 1 roll on a fucking board ,😫🔫
---
you dont even need to search they are right there on the front page of the sub
---
The only two shot weapon I’ve ever gotten is also my most accurate weapon, only thing I can ever hit things far away with so I never even knew two shot reduced accuracy 
---
Stacking stairs? Happened to me yesterday. It gets really fucky when you stack more than 2.
---
Thank you! Worked for me too
---
I change enough cards around as it is. Cant be bothered to reslot and rearmor everytime I see a yellow arrow or dot on the map. Setting up for bloodied? Not while I'm defending a workshop from missing molerats. 
---
I get it, pvp only works against non pvp players. My first true pvp experience of a stimpak war showed that. It truly is setup as raiders. Fat soft targets collecting resources, way easier than a real fight. 
---
The op build is really only an issue when mob hunting in large groups. Melee and bloodied builds dont sweep rooms before anyone can tag anything. They are smart play. 
---
Without the nerf, going forward no new guns would be valuable, because they were good enough for everything. Now a small level upgrade like lvl 60 is enough to devalue current overstocked weapons.
---
I agree with everything you said brother. The nerfs are a godsend.
---
One thing though. Nocturnal, yes nocturnal, gives a 100% damage boost as the night goes on. I’m on a mission now to find a nice nocturnal with explosive, 25% faster fire rate, or crit damage rifle for the PvP server.
---
Holy... Shit... YOU'RE RIGHT!!! THOSE SONS A BITCHES!!!!!!! 
---
Well thats silly. I'd rather be safe in a loading screen, than running around as a head that can take damage.
---
They could limit the level hazmat suits drop at which would help with the problem: [https://i.imgur.com/W9jKiet.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/W9jKiet.jpg)
---
Melee could use a PvP nerf, changing PvE would make a larger impact.
---
I'll do events just for the sake of it being there if I happen to fast travel close to them, but aside from Scorched Earth, Patrol Duty, Uranium Fever and Census Violence, I don't go out of my way to participate.
---
Aside from Scorched Earth, I've never gotten anything worthwhile out of said events, but I've read that they have a chance to drop good plans that I or someone else might need.
---
Heart of the Swamp is an event I actually enjoy for some reason.  I don't think I've ever gotten anything interesting for completing it, but it's fun.
---
I absolutely hate The Messenger.  That is the worst event in the game, in my opinion.
---
I’m on ps4 and the exact same thing happens to me every time I load in.
---
I use a Tesla rifle. It does a fair amount of damage and is a great crowd controller. 
---
Less rads, more filling.
---
Never said it was a good reason...lol
---
Same could be said for TSE but instead they are just converting them into paperweights. 
---
Indeed there is, a full roll back wouldn't be fair to everyone who has a legitimate tse, as dupers get banned the market will stabilize 
---
This alone to centralize daily quests would be a game changer.
---
Well yeah sorry, didnt write it well enugh i guess i will correct some things.
---
Difference is mele isn't broken and comes with risks getting close. The bloodied build is the way it is for a reason because your hp has to be low
---
Someone also suggested that some bulk stuff should use glass instead of plastic, which makes sense.
---
This is a great idea!
---
I have lots of unduped rounds. Found the good old fashioned way.
---
Classic.
---
Haha. I got downvoted? Wow. 😆 It wasn't even a snide remark. I was literally asking what he meant and informing if anyone wasn't aware.
---
I really want two shot weapons.  
---
I played the heck out of FO4, like 600+ hours, and explosive is cool for 5 minutes and then it's boring and OP.   Plus you end up killing yourself a bunch.   I was always happy to find an explosive weapon, but it went on my wall and I almost never used them.   I went out of my way to create a more interesting build.   
---
If I had to pick one to stay, it would be two shot.
---
I’m not saying don’t nerf my op things? I played melee before and my melee build was much better damage output and defense than my range build. High damage due to risk? Put emergency protocols on, use grounded serum. Under 20% hp all defenses are over 700 and you take almost no damage in PA. There is not risk, only gain on melee.  My second main is a rifle build. They have an anti armor perk? Sg doesn’t to my knowledge but it can come as a legendary bonus. Balancing means equal across the board. Not “TSE is getting a 75% reduction but you melee guys can keep your 10k damage per swing” my assumption is you’re one of those guys who run bloodied and will be ate up when they nerf it as well. I never said this was to make new content. Also looks as if you either don’t know how to read or didn’t understand the point being made. But the vast majority of who read it understood it. I’m sorry that you don’t fall into that category 👍🏻
---
+1 for Favorite Perks flag. Would make swapping out one or two cards so much easier as well!
---
Melee was what I mainly used until I found my anti-armor 3* combat rifle. 
---
Then I started lighting ghouls up.
---
Honestly, my favorite guns before that was a suppressed hardened bloodied combat shotgun and my instigating handmade rifle. I only really used them if all my melee weapona were broken 
---
Perhaps you should just play the game and stop spamming reddit mate.
---
Yea I love my Two Shot .50 Cal it's actually usable 
---
when there are so many complaints about stuff that doesn´t work at all or properly, people want to fix it and or make it better.
---
if shit worked people would spend more time playing and less time complaining online where the community listens to iteslf over and over
---
in other mmos these kind of game breaking problems are fixed waay faster. Todd has some serious booing to recieve once he decides to show his face to calm the masses
---
Because this is fo76 dude where hype is law and reality is ignored 
---
Even with the scaling you still get super overpowered and can go back to roflstomp everything with how big a difference gear makes it’s just then the new zones they release that then suddenly your not op in until you are, but those zones are static and don’t scale cause they already start at max level 
---
the armor penetration perks are also so common in every build that armor is basically worthless too, its really up to perks like blocker and dodgy and fireproof for the right situation
---
Exactly, as someone with a two-shot dragon with no other effects I never feel like I'm using something insanely op and unbalanced, even in pvp, sure it does a load of damage but you miss a lot so I think it was decently balanced
---
Lol I also play bloodied, and I'm sure you have been 1 shot many times. I have also tanked the queen with my emergency protocols low hp setup; yeah it is strong. That takes synergizing perks, gear, mutations etc. where TSE only needs demo expert, that's it.
---
The point is that TSE is (was) very LOW effort for high reward. Easy mode. No thought required. A child with no game experience could assemble a TSE build and it would be strong.
---
I've played for like 30 hours and it hasn't happened to me so it hasn't happened to anyone.  
---
Nope. 
---
[puts cotton balls in ears]
---
LA LA LA LA LA
---
It is broken. You can one hit anything in the game and with a bloodied build if you wear full unyielding which most do then you can sit there hitting the queen at 20% health for Wynn and never die, ive done it. No risk at all.
---
Both are the problem. Two shot is far too powerful of an upgrade over non-legendary and typically adds more damage than 9 perks worth do.
---
Just because Explosive is a bigger offender on some weapons does not excuse the immense power creep two shot brings.
---
You get to RP as a new General Store owner, patiently waiting on the first delivery to fill the shelves. 
---
I agree, I almost bought them thinking they were one thing. Why would I want the bareass SD mart look. 
---
&gt;obviously not with sniping or sneak attacking
---
Lies. If I'm fighting things above level 50 my stealth sniper build still ends up without me fighting wave after wave of bullet sponges.
---
you don't lose anything unless you plan on quitting the current hybrid server
---
Sounds great, but it'd be shame to lock content away from solo players who don't have friend to unlock the other terminals to get in. I get it's a multiplayer game but everything else is doable solo and a lot of the Fallout fanbase play on their own. 
---
....but it was way harder to get a TSE than to make bloodied build if you were playinf legit so that sort of balances that out.
---
And how rare is unyielding if you didn't buy a duped copy ?
---
🙏
---
I do wish their was a "team" stash box so that I can dump found gear in a team box for my teammates without having to engage in trade or drop it on the ground.
---
But you get more flux tho if you nuke NW and fight her from bravo 
---
For all those asking its cdkeys website.
---
Yeah, tmi disagree with losing all our stuff. 
---
What about all that wood? How else are you going to make lunch?
---
BGS should start paying redditors for doing the job of those in charge of the game ideas. We should have had a main city from the get go, so people might actually get together outside of nuke zones
---
I’ve still only been there once. I’ll report my next haul for comparison 
---
I hear you, but I think the idea is to give us a playground to PVP in with the characters we love.
---
How are you going to breathe inside a closed bunker without life support?
---
I agree with ya. I have a TSE Gatling and prefer melee  build. I'll whip it in Nukesprings if other players are pumping TSE shotty into the mobs. That or Furious Tesla just to try and tag as many as I can.
---
Not rare at all. I got my full set in 1 day at whitesprings. 
---
It did happen to me and another guy at whitesprings, this one asshole was running around one shotting us in pacifist mode with power armor on, no idea what he used though I didn’t see the flashy display of explosive bullets but one shotting with slap damage is real although I’ve only ever seen it from this one jackass and never again 
---
How was your TSE gun ANY harder to get than my  bloodied + explosive gun? (Bloodied isnt melee only)
---
I'll wait.
---
I mean it’s possible I just feel it wouldn’t fit in
---
&gt;That would make it 7.2x times faster to earn caps than it is today
---
Huh, really neat? 
---
&gt;And keep people playing for hours instead of returning a few hours per day.
---
That's the point, to make it feel rewarding to play more. 
---
&gt;Or they could limit vendor cap regeneration it to ingame playtime. 
---
That's what I meant sorry I didn't specify it well enough. 
---
&gt;But that would make a lot of idling players. I don't think Bethesda want either.
---
Fair, but I think they're going to get that either way. 
---
&gt;I like the regenerating cap stash idea.
---
Thank you. 
---
&gt;But keep cap regeneration at 1 cap per vendor pool every 7-8 minutes would make it the same balance as today, but be a bit less annoying.
---
That would certainly work with me and I'm sure Bethesda would probably figure out the rate on the back end anyways.
---
Still, every time I see the two things I called the original commenter on.
---
I can't help but think how quickly that would shatter the community by allowing people to not only make 2-3 times more. (Roughly I really don't have the exact numbers on the amount of vendors) and make so they can buy mats in bulk without having to worry about just how much it's going to cost them. Would completely remove the need to farm them and kill what little there is left to do for alot of players.
---
Though maybe if the caps you don't get are split randomly between like several people in server or something that way you at least know they're going somewhere and don't just vanish into thin air. 
---
I have a AA 25% faster fire rate Radium. I have killed a couple bloodied players with this. I assume they were bloodied due to not moving at all when I hit them, low irritated health bar, and they die VERY quick from the radiation 
---
between top o the world and whitesprings theres a spawn,or rinse the whitesprings security staff ( do they drop em?)
---
 Eventually is the big word here... 
---
You can criticize all you want, but I insist that a mutation that did nothing other than giving you a really big butt would improve the game for everyone.
---
It would definitely possible to have a separate instance of Vault 76. Currently the vault door can't be interacted with, so all they'd have to do is make it an entrance to the market version of the vault. 
---
Still not a good idea though. Doesn't make one bit of sense that the vault is in reclamation day mode for any new players and in market mode for everyone else.
---
I can direct you to \[this thread\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a3olmm/antiarmor\_sledgehammer\_and\_normal\_sledgehammer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a3olmm/antiarmor_sledgehammer_and_normal_sledgehammer/)) where there is a breakdown some armor penetration.
---
Get rank 3 bear arms
---
No, thanks. No desire to start all over. Just because you're bored ...
---
It costs much more to purchase from a vendor. Aside from charity, why wouldn't they sell it for 1000 and still give you a discount?
---
Thanks for letting us know!
---
Out of curiosity are you able to provide us with a prioritized list of current issues that they dev team is aware of/working on?
---
Honestly, I disagree. I just wish wood armour had more of a use such as an inherint stealth bonus 
---
Nerfing the guns but allowing the hammers that can 1-shot everything is just stupid.
---
Sounds like your family's coffers are full.
---
You can use any in world container for that if you need. just make sure its just your team in the area as you do not want an ninja looters.
---
It would be like the tower in destiny 2
---
&gt; That or you can periodically block everyone on your server. 
---
Do this if your low level and want to be left alone mostly. I see dots on the map standing for too long and i go check them out to see what they are doing... im sure others do to.. not malicious or anything just really curious, maybe you found a really good camping spot. 
---
Hmmm. I see what you are doing here but I'm talking about all bloodied, not the elusive Bloodied+Explosive specifically. That's Anecdotal evidence to an arguement I wasnt even making. Nice try though. Also your exolosive legendary is also getting wrecked in this update, they all are. 
---
Seriously wondering this, if your searching for the plans to make a gun, I take it it’s slightly rare or hard to find, the price your offering is maybe 30 caps over vender asking price. I totally get if someone has an extra but your not really offering anything 
---
Yeah I’m pretty sure you still lose caps if your killed regardless, possibly reduced but definitly always lose caps if killed by players I think 
---
the only time i see the increase is in nuke zones
---
Yeah, they aren't all pissy and unwashed.
---
Delicious.
---
This exactly, you need a heavy gunner with full tenderizer, bloody mess perks etc to take her down as it is. End game built for one type of build...
---
I mean they're basically people-veal
---
Yes, it caps at 200%, and has a leeway of several seconds, I've heard \~10 seconds so long as you haven't hit another target but I haven't tested it myself.
---
My husband's character: **Michael Cabot** \- distant cousin of Jack Cabot, but rather than looking into the past, as that side of the family have, he's looking to the future.  A power armour engineer whose thesis on integrated AI in power armour landed him a place in Vault 76, out of the vault he is an arrogant loner right from the off, he only cares about finishing and bringing his thesis to life and spends his time scouring Appalachia for the parts he needs to upgrade his power armour. 
---
My character: **Suzie Bennett** \- Biology was her passion from the get-go and her paper on radiation exposure and mutation effects all but ensured her place in the vault. Kind, helpful to a fault and particularly naive, her life outside the vault leads her to The Responders as she attempts to help the world around her but quickly finds fascination in The Scorched and scorch-beasts. 
---
A series of hilarious encounters where they continue to bump into each other and are forced to work together eventually leads to a mutual pseudo-respect. Suzie has never liked that Michael was out for his own goals and Michael hates that he continually has to bail her out of trouble but eventually, they begin to understand and even like the other as company and as a person. Not that they'll ever actually admit it when they're caught up in a frequent low-scale argument.
---
I’m imagining someone constructing walls outside of the vault and then turning it into a 5 star hotel, selling the vault rooms to people who need a place to stay and offering food at the cafe for a price. 
---
Therefore this post is pointless. 
---
That's nice of you, enhances your flavor!
---
Agreed.  Maybe the vending machine plans come from the Vendor faction questline?
---
Rule 9.
---
I don't get why you bothered? You can't even report these people because you can't accuse them of benefitting from duping since they didn't actually get anything out of this.
---
np, gl with the farm :)
---
If they make a pure PVP mode, I will shit my pants.
---
Stop being so dense and look at the big picture here.
---
Strength is way to cluttered tbh there’s to many good perks there, between blocked incisor and the damage for whichever weapon you use I can’t event equip all those with 15 strength cause this game is impossible to play without equipping a bunch of weight reducing perks 
---
This is a fantastic idea. 
---
It's also a QOL change that would involve the devs giving a shit about the quality of the experience,  so it won't ever happen.
---
i blue screened once in the first 5 minutes after servers went up after patch tuesday (PS4).  however i have now played 2 full days since then without a disconnect of any kind.  so thats over 20+ hours since my last crash since the patch.   this is much better stability than before the patch in my experience.
---
Pitiful you are
---
Oh, didn't know it costs so much. I'll just grind out more caps and then post again
---
All you have to do is remove the roof panel and place the generator first, then a roof over it. It's not 2 levels high
---
**The hate is strong in this one.**
---
Yeah there’s a locked up train station in mire free states
---
It would be cool if it was accessed only by quest line, like doing Abbie or BOS and closed off to others 
---
But not really, to kill someone with melee you have to run up to them and let them hit you. You shouldnt be playing pvp if you're bad enough to let another player get that close to you. It's a trade off, big damage for big risk. Stop complaining because you keep dying, stop playing pvp if it's so unfair to you
---
but... THE IMMERSION!!! I want to be a camouflaged assassin tree that after centuries of  my tree brethren having been chopped down, now chase down players with a 3\* assassins hatchet with +40% swing speed and 90% weight reduction (i actually just picked up this drop yesterday).... if only i could buy an emote 'make it rain leaves' from the atom store, i could then bury murdered players in my tree dandruff (aka leaves)
---
Bit rich, considering you are on that list.
---
Thanks, but someone else already sent me this link in the comments!
---
Lol this post is really old, never thought anyone would still comment 
---
Just have to use a slanted roof. 
---
If you have no interest then scroll on. Doesn't make it spam 
---
That is sheet damage in pip boy before any drugs. I can get to 3.5k with psychotats. If I factor in my sneak multiplier. Im doing about 7k.
---
Yes it does. It's a maybe power boost over non two shot. These crazy leaps need to be curved.
---
A 25% damage increase is still very good.
---
R.I.P TB
---
You broke Ruke 9 of this sub. You should find something better to do with your time. People are whi are buying duped items aren't even breaking any official rules, just the people duping are,
---
I know it's not faster production, overall.
---
But it basically just ignores the shower rates and fills them all up at the industrial rate?
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Oh for sure, he got up to almost 17k damage, definitely not intended.  Hopefully they just nerf the way all those stat bonuses he uses effect each other but just straight nerfing the Bloody affix is easier so they'll probably go that route.  But seeing as how it took over 2 months for them to even announce a nerf for TSE, it's probably not coming soon if so.
---
I’d be happy w/plans then mods. You can always level up items you craft.
---
bro...but then i wouldnt have my 3\* quad tse rolling pin!!!! /s
---
did you stack the offset stair cases? if you did, you can fix that by building a regular staircase, attached to the confused items, down to the ground supported by a foundation.
---
Which leads hardcore fans be come back and see a new direction to the existing game
---
No, thanks. Why does Spain suck, though? I'm curious.
---
I am not in front of the game, but I swear my handmade is 20lbs with no weight reduction options other than ones found on armor or legendaries.
---
I'm seeing tons of posts from people crying for melee nerfs, hell I just commented on one about 30 seconds ago. People will cry and whine about anything they dont have
---
I rarely get killed by other players, this post was to make a point... If you cant see that then just move along.
---
It’s all good but we need to be able to join the same servers where we built stuff. Otherwise it is pointless. Personally, when I saw that we loose all progress, except what we build in our camps, i was very concerned about the future of the game. Every enemy respawns, every building disappears, every container has loot, despite me looting it few hours ago. It is not immersive and if things stay the same I doubt the game will have much of a future.
---
Unyielding is super common. Maybe not 3 stars with good rolls but getting basic 1 star unyielding is really easy 
---
honestly thats why my melee gear is all unyielding for the str bonus so i can carry AND use all the melee perks. its mainly the first aid perk that kills me on weight.
---
i got that and explosive vents for my ultracite armor yesterday in the same drop.....again
---
Your title of "all bloodied weapons" means that includes explosive. You also compared to TSE so of course bloodied + explosive is a fair comparison.
---
Right now with a bloodied + explosive gun vs a 2shot explosive gun, 2 shot does more damage. Even when doing a full bloodied low hp build, if all else was the same on the gun, the 2 shot does more.
---
At high hp 2 shot also does more. So bloodied competes but you need to be at 15% hp (die in about 1 hit) vs just being comfortable with your high hp without losing damage.
---
I've said since launch that this game needs a central hub. And at least a few human npc vendors or something 
---
Dont be a douche
---
I was just thinking of something similar. 
---
While I think, just based on my personal experience and the posts I've seen here, PVP players are in the minority, I don't think the servers themselves would be low population because it'd be pulling all the PVP players into those servers.  Fewer active servers maybe, but full of all people who want PVP.  S'why I've considered PVE/PVP servers a win-win.
---
Unless PVP players are such a minority that they can barely fill a single server, but it's probably not that bad.
---
Just hoping that this talk of an unrestricted PVP mode I'm seeing doesn't mean that the other mode is what we already have.  Pacifist mode isn't enough for a PVE server, I hope we'll actually get a proper PVE server or "mode."
---
&gt; You wont see him, becouse after people started telling others about those spawn, they are all dead... 
---
no the reason is when you all start telling everyone where stuff spawns beth is jsut gonna nerf it. like they will remove the legendary spawns from the civic center if it becomes too easy or if players just start doing this
---
Don't worry, I can't recall even a single instance where Bethesda EVER EVEN ONCE adopted any suggestion from some rando idiot on the internet. In fact, it would probably be a big legal headache for them if they ever did, since the suggestion's author could then potentially sue them or ask for money for stealing his/her wonderful idea. 
---
Agree and disagree.
---
Without legendary effects, both guns are under performing. MG42 more so than 50 not only because of damage but because there isn't a bulk 308 crafting option. 50 cal is definitely an end game weapon with how much ammo you need to feed that thing for extended gunfights and almost requires ammosmith and super duper perks maxed out.
---
With just a single effect, anti-armor, along with the appropriate build the 50 cal turns into something that is highly usable AND you won't blow yourself up from it. Can't speak for the MG42; I don't bother with it mainly because of how much .308 I would need to craft to fire that thing for 5 minutes.
---
While the TSE nerf is going to hurt, I don't think it'll make the 50 cal pointless, although the recipe to craft 50 cal might need to be revised at that point. Keep the amount of materials needed, but boost the ammo smith 2* amount to 250 so that we're crafting a full, standard, magazine. The MG42 on the other hand... it's a meme weapon and will continue to be a meme weapon until it receives a buff and a recipe to craft 308 in bulk or make a specific 7.92x57 Mauser ammo for it akin to the 50 cal ammo recipe.
---
You need the aluminum crafting perk
---
Well I've called it 'sneaky sniper' in my original post, but all I mean is that I'm going to sneak and use a rifle at long range, not necessarily a sniper rifle. But it's good to know gauss rifles could be potentially better. From your last sentence about the close range build do you mean to say it's not possible to always depend on your rifle to clear each situation?
---
No one asked you to do this, in fact you didn’t have to. Anyone in this sub could own duped gear right now. You white knights are so self absorbed. Are you expecting a thank you? Grow up 
---
Its the two things, explosive does alot of damage added to the weapon, especially with demo expert. That and a gauss rifle has the highest base damage per shot for any semi auto rifle.
---
Who cares, honestly? It’s not like everyone in the sub knows each other, so I doubt they give a damn about people buying them.
---
I was exaggerating, obviously. My point is regular guns suck hard. TSE as it stands is actually worthy of being a legendary gun
---
I think if they did add NPCs it would change the world in such a way that all current quest may not be a thing. Could become seasonal where we are constantly getting new questions to progress the story and fill in the blanks.
---
Bethesda has never done level locked instances to my knowledge but I could be wrong. You’re right it’s possible to do but I really don’t see it happening 
---
Great post, those are some imaginative characters. I usually work out my RP storyline during chargen and the Vault scenes (or in FO4, during the prewar scene), but that was so laughably short in FO76 I didn't end up with an idea at all before I'm shooting commiebots with a pipegun.
---
Over time, I decided my character is the same as from FO4. She came here from the Commonwealth to look for live nuclear bombs to help bolster the strength of her Minutemen dictatorship. That was an excuse though. She got sick of helpless settlers who can't even pick their own crops, and left Piper in charge of her empire of dirt. Now she wanders the world once again, having random adventures.
---
I don't care if my head canon doesn't fit their broken chronology.
---
I wouldn't mind either synths that look like humans or sentient ghouls. Lots of way to approach npc's given all the lore that exists, but I do like the fact that all the other humans are real players.
---
And your point is invalid. Why would anyone ever choose melee if it takes the same amount of swings to kill someone as it does shots from a handmade? You have to make melee a viable option, high damage makes it viable when you include the risk of having to run up to another player and stay within melee range
---
same - only seen it once but also had a flight helm spawn there too. it looks identical but with goggles.
---
How is this thread not closed already?
---
I did the same thing, probably around your level, and it's really not the end of the world.  I just hit lvl 130 today and I'm just grabbing extra crafting cards that I don't really need, but may come in handy in case I need to craft a flaming pitchfork or gatling gun for some reason.
---
What I'd really like is the ability to throw cards away.  I have so many Cha and End cards (I always seem to get one cha card with each pack) that I'll never use and makes it slightly more annoying to scroll across dozens of cards to swap in Hard Bargain/Travel Agent for Lone Wanderer or Happy Camper if I sleep at my house when I'm AFK.
---
i saw the same incoherence lmao
---
my friend if you have that many hours in the game you have the patience of a saint.
---
dude. many of these same people would have rage quite and never made it through a water stage in the original mario bro games..... or Contra without the 30 lives code....is this really a surprise?
---
Right but you are trying to boil my argument down to a specific legendary combination and I'm not going to validate that with an argument as its not what I'm talling about.
---
It likely does, the way they handle weight on mods is a bit off..  
---
Want to see something weird? Look at the weapon weight in the bench, and switch between a short and long barrel on most weapons...  
---
Long barrel is lighter on most.
---
ah see, i found tape 5 before i found 1 or 2, so the markers ended with the quest, i was able to head back and find 2 in harpers, but i for the life of me can't find 1, its in the cabin house for the sunday family yeah? i'll have to look harder again
---
due to the SB attacks i had to rebuild the lead extractor up top and the power connectors attached to the rocks/cliff connecting to the cave pretty frequently. however i did have some hanging lights in the cave that SB destroyed once through the walls.  anything outside the acid cave would get destroyed regularly.  i built a stairway up to the lead extractor that couldnt be destroyed.
---
I know....unlikely....but a guy can dream.
---
A lot of time in fallout 76 is spent making the game bearable to play. You hord perks for crafting, unlocking safes and terminals, micro managing carry weight to the max, repairing your crap that always needs to break, and dealing with bullshut hunger and thirst meters that dont need to be there. Then you have to spend hours hording junk and basic supplies just so you dont get fucked by the game's insatiable thirst for your hard earned resources.
---
You spend so much damn time making this game not annoying. And most of the perks reflect that with lame, all too specific ways to manage this or that annoying feature they decided add in this game. 
---
We need more shit like marsupial. We dont need to spend upwards of an hour at times clearing out our stash due to weight restrictions. 
---
The game could really use some changes because a lot of the ways it tries to be difficult are annoying as fuck  
---
yup, but somehow different.
---
the big picture is that people with sentinels never actually fight someone who knows the way to stagger you, you arent looking for a fight, you always pick on people who have never even heard of that impossibly rare legendary set so you can get easy caps.
---
Well, being smacked with a deathclaw gauntlet point blank 20 times in a row and taking no damage in mutual combat, pretty sure they weren't in pacifist. They were able to kill me when I let them.
---
If a mod is greyed out it means you don't have the required perk to craft it. Double check on that.
---
Lots of good suggestions in here.
---
/u/AgentClaret was on the list. No wonder you want it closed.
---
I very rarely crash. What kind of system are you running?
---
Calibrated shocks for the Excavator armor are available at the vendors.  I have two and my carry weight is 435.
---
Also another thing, convert dupes into another random card.
---
i think i need to clarify this , im not shilling the website. i seen it advertised and came here to post it for people who are looking to buy the game.  
---
if its safe or not and you wish to use it or not is up to you.
---
So here’s the issue with selling duped items.
---
For the duper he is clearly in the wrong and should be banned.
---
I’ve bought TSE weapons from people before and I always check their inventory to see if they are clearly a duper or not. If they are I generally just leave. If they only have 2-3 weapons I ask them “hey how did you get that”
---
They usually tell me they found the item while playing the game.
---
So the argument I’m trying to make is. Sometimes it’s not easy to tell if an item has been duped or not.
---
So to punish people for carrying 1-2 legendary weapons i think would be wrong and well quite frankly at least half the player base would be banned.
---
the meat loses its taste from being fed all that wasteland crap
---
Send me message when u are available 
---
So what happens to the people who grind for 100's of hours for good loot when there is no more good loot worth grinding for?
---
Now that the Nerf brigade has taken over 76 it will be amazing if the servers are still on line a year from now.
---
HAHAHAHAHA
---
You could make this game offline, single player with a voiceless protagonist with human npc's and a dialogue tree with skill checks and some of these people would STILL have a hard time swallowing their pride to play the game, let alone give it praise for doing all of this.
---
It's just my gut feeling but this game is dead to all the so-called "true" Fallout fans.
---
I guess I should have said floor.
---
But I like your slanted floor idea.
---
Ouch
---
that's like buying stolen merchandise and saying " I didn't steal it tho"  
---
they need to make it faction based pvp, with faction specific rewards/vendor/ranking system
---
instead of attacking players camps, they need pvp oriented goals, it will also help to funnel players into making contact more frequent, and to still make use of the player built defense stuff in game then maybe bases/outposts that can be captured, similar to workshops but overhauled and produces items unique to the faction that has control of it, not shit you can find all over the map
---
for 'safe spaces' each faction should have a HQ/main camp somewhere that cant be captured
---
they should introduce NPC caravans that travel between faction camps for players to raid
---
FFA should still be a thing for people who dont want to join any faction too
---
bounties should be set by players only, not automatic
---
I doubt any of my ideas will come to fruition, they only did this with succesfull MMO's 
---
Just how do you get back into the same server you just left*?  
---
*Unless you're in a server with friends.
---
Because if you use melee than they cant shoot you with explosive up close and if you use melee you can hit any high lvl player and it will usually prock their electrically charged thereby initiating combat without their consent where you can just murder them wihtout gwttinf wanted. My point is valid bud.
---
Normal weapons do *not* take forever to kill a level 68 mutant, it only takes me a few shots from a bloody pipe revolver pistol. 
---
Everyone seems to want to one shot everything, that's not fun to me. 
---
No. It boils down to my very first point; one takes a build, card investment, gear investment etc, one does not.
---
Bloodied: PROS: high damage output CONS: die in 1 hit
---
2 shot: PROS: high damage output CONS: ?
---
Anyways good luck on your anti bloodied mission
---
Dodgy closes the gap between getting the 100% avoidance at the cost of ap. The radium rifles are a good choice for pvp definitely, they fire fast and the radiation damage helps too. These builds still take radiation damage even through dodgy, at least thus seems the case when being attacked by ghouls.
---
the 30,000+ you are talking about requires multiple drugs, alch, nuka cola, being revived, being very low health, 5 pieces of fairly rare armour and a lot of perk cards. TSE requires 5 perk points that's it and you may talk about the 30k+ but in the time it takes a melee user to do that an auto handmade/heavy tse could pump out around the same damage without having to be low hp.
---
While I agree bloodied melee is very strong the thing that's causing it to be so strong is the unyielding gear, not the bloodied weapons themselves.
---
What about AAA batteries?  Or are they too small?  Do they make rechargeable batteries in C or D?
---
lol
---
(how my brain first interpreted what you typed)
---
I don’t sleep eight hours. I haven’t since I was about 12 years old. Most people don’t.
---
Commie Wacker 2 OP pls nerf
---
Yeah, yeah, it all clear.
---
Spain sucks is a sour boy
---
I have a glass cannon build and I die quite a bit. Just lately it seems every other death when I hit respawn it crashes.
---
Their are laws for that, not for this.
---
I had a look into it a while back. Didn't look like it. Just makes building and repairing them cheaper.
---
Nice! Revenge by giving them high blood pressure!
---
People who managed to dupe a ton of bobbleheads can oneshot in pacifist mode, because Bethesda were super-dumb and made bobbleheads effects stack.  
---
IDK..  
---
I keep hearing melee is OP, so I switched to a rifle, then heavy weapon build (level 310, so have all those cards) and using non-explosive two shot handmade and a vampiric Gatling gun I completely wrecked mobs, in the same areas, killing just about as quickly as I did with melee.  
---
You can't one shot as easily (though I have a friend who's a non-PA sniper build that one shots everything), but you kill damn fast considering you don't have to run around chasing the mobs.
---
PM me, none of my friends have made the transition to PCMR so I often play alone.   I'll be your friend.   
---
Man, that is some A-class scummy shit you just pulled off. Get down off that high horse you're on. It's a fucking video game.
---
I love the game....not even 100% sure why tbh....I am a fallout fan...maybe its that.
---
So nasty I had to laugh.
---
I don't actually care about bloodied builds kid, its to make a point.
---
I run a VATS Crit build for assult rifles critting every other shot. That +50% crit is something i search for and the day I get it the world will burn. But sure, make it do even more : p
---
How are they nerfing explosive I saw nothing on this
---
Yes. I have around 4,500 rounds if you’re interested. 
---
This is genius! Please, Bethesda!
---
No other barrel is valid IMO.  Crystalizing rocks with the reduced ammo cost per shot.
---
Hey, if he hit level 5 and didn't go Pacifist for a few levels, he was asking to be dinner.
---
You arent making a very good one, kid.
---
i kind of believe they did this on purpose. they envisioned a game where players were completely isolated, victimizing each other, where players where scared when they saw another player approach. I say this, as basic things like lack of Txt chat, No player Hub, the horrible trade system all seem deliberate in my mind.
---
They wanted Fo76 to have a lonely feel to it, unfortunately that is where the backlash started. Day 1 reviews happened mostly because people arrived expecting a traditional MMO experience set in the Fallout world, but Fo76 was never meant to be that.
---
maybe implementing a few traditional MMO in-game systems could bridge the gap between these two very different game designs.
---
Yes, one guy on Reddit sums up Canada. 
---
1 hit for wok is faster than 8 hits for wok 
---
It's so sad that it has gotten to the point where people think explosive weapons are the only ones they can use. Isnt it? Nobody said you had to use explosive weapons, and its entirely your fault if you let a melee character get that close to you. And ANYONE can prock electrically charged, not just melee people. That itself is another topic, that is a broken game mechanic that bethesda needs to address. So no, your point is still not valid
---
finally it's working! Sent you a request :)
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted, this definitely seems to be the case. Plenty of players are over now over level 100 and care more about rare junk than a few caps.
---
Yeah. Hook up with one of those higher level players and go to the golf course. You can hop up on the wall outside the clubhouse while he runs in and gets them all to cheese him out. Get a shot in each one, and let him kill them off from higher ground.
---
But, if this is your first play through, I don't recommend it. Wander and explore the west side of the map and enjoy the early parts of the game. 
---
I’ve died because I fell in a fissure while being blinded by a Scorchbeast ray (it certainly wasn’t going the kill me. I’ve died because I jumped off a cliff without my power armor to see how much fall damage I would take with the Bird Bones mutation. I’ve died because Gatling Guns are weird to aim and I fired explosive bullets into a railing I was standing behind. I died because I entered the world at my CAMP without armor on and a glowing level 60+ bear mauled me before I could move. 
---
I’ve never actually been killed by an enemy in normal gameplay. 
---
Ah, it's on the ground floor of a structure and you want to build on top of it? Yeah, I've learned in 76 to build one and decorate one story at a time. A lot of stuff can't be placed if there's a second floor/roof on top, even though there's room for it. 
---
Had to scrap my top floor of my warehouse so I could put my decontamination arch on the bottom floor. 
---
The only reason I can effectively kill Scorchbeasts is my 2 shot Gauss Rifle. Please don't take it from me Bethesda. 25% is not two shot. It's one and a quarter shot.
---
1) What platform are you playing on?
---
XB1
---
2) Gamertag/PSN/Bethesda.net account
---
 djloid/ djloid2010
---
3) Videos/screenshots of the issue (if applicable)
---
4) Description of the issue (what happened, where did it occur, what did it affect, quest name etc.)
---
Since the last patch, I will fast travel somewhere, and when I arrive, I can no longer move, nor access the PipBoy. The only thing I can do is access my map. I then log out, log back in and it is fine. Doesn't happen all the time, but has happened 3 times since the Jan 14th update.
---
5) Bethesda Customer Support Ticket Number (if applicable)
---
Because Bethesda / Zenimax doesn't understand what they are doing / why..  
---
The "clarification" yesterday I believe was a "walk back" when they saw the outrage, and most of their other changes (Public workshop nerfs, Feed the People fix) show they are making changes that look good on paper but are fundamentally flawed. 
---
Reading intensifies.
---
Today I learned opinions exist.
---
Yes but... The method I'm talking about could potentially double the benefits from calibrated shocks. By having two whole sets then dying would apply all 4 shocks benefits while physically wearing one pair.
---
Have 4 shocks in inventory. Wear a pair. Die. Respawn with the effects doubled. 
---
I haven't tested it but I did test using core assembly and Tesla coils at the same time.
---
Wouldn't it be nice if they made it so you HAD to roleplay a bit.  Say launching a BoS mission, and everyone has to be wearing BoS gear, Scribe Outfit if you don't have the PA, etc.
---
Somewhat related...I have a 90% reduced weight Gauss Rifle, and it weighs 10 pounds. No goddamn chance it would weight 100 without it!
---
I can't speak to a fully sneak build, I do have some perks for it...but I would recommend a shotgun and enforcer perks. With some of the mobs have high health and/or a high DR, it will be hard to put them down in the first shot. Deathclaws and ghouls can close the distance fast, so manually aim for both legs to cripple them on the ground. Finish them off with a good melee.
---
Haha, youre whole argument was that 1 single weaponwas an exception... Yours wasn't even a point.
---
Try the Gauss riffle, perfect example of a OMG riffle.
---
I offer 700 caps for 2000 ammo
---
If it’s going to be a foundation or garage it’ll be a higher PSI mix, too. Stuff it wouldn’t work very well on would be like sidewalks. (DOT is Department of Transportation; like mixes for bridges and highways).
---
Your not alone,  Last update cost me 20+ FPS, went from buttery stable and smooth to CTD's every 10 to 30 minutes..
---
It’s our job to repopulate West Virginia!
---
Where all the female characters at!?!?
---
Yeah it’s hard enough to get one friend to come with me to something it’d be literally impossible to bring 4 people at once unless they add in some kind of looking for group que 
---
Nothing to see here but a sketchy website. Don’t buy from there. 
---
Omg......this is beyond a sad cry for attention...here's your validation now go whack off in the corner.
---
Its not rlly plenty with how spongy enemies are late game; scorchbessts are gonna be even more annoying and sbq wont even be worth doing lol
---
It is valid and you are choosing to be willfully ignorant of the problem when it is right in front of you. You don't like it then just move along.
---
Hey, maybe he's playing on a Tablet on the French Riviera with 5 hot models waiting on him.
---
If the Atoms were cheaper I'd have probably been suckered I to spending $50.00 by now. 
---
Absolutely agree.  TS weapons aren't that OP and have big issues in VATS which need fixing.  Making them 1.25-shot is a big over-reaction that makes them a bit useless.  Just as bad as leaving them as they are.  
---
I just find it funny how many of the same people I see brigading about "dupers dupers dupers" are actually looking to buy items... I have no issues with them buying duped items but at least dont attempt to pretend they dont.
---
Actually i pulled the data from polls, check the link.  So most people do. 
---
Still, let's say you sleep an hour less, you manage to pile a normal person's 16 hour day into 3 hours and some change? Smh
---
How often do you really NEED turrets? I only ever maybe put one in. And that's just to point me in the right direction of anything that happened to find a hidden spot. 
---
A game can be fun while still being a buggy mess. Which it is.
---
Nerf vampire knives!
---
Would you do a 1,000?
---
I know I wish they listened to the community since day one but the game crashes when nukes hit and telsa rifle completed broken when you shoot hordes and heads up the atom shop works fine with all the occurring stuff happening at least they know how to put 4 player coop in the next game when they balance out fallout 76 atm it feels like another no man's sky lol
---
Log out and log back in. Fixed it for me.
---
They've always had the technology? There are already NPCs, ai vendors, and NPCs at random events in the game. A limited amount of NPCs was always a matter of choice due to the setting. Adding a few more human ones in as Appalachia is rebuilt is something I can see them doing though. 
---
They should have just stuck to single player RPGs. I would much rather be playing ES6 right now.
---
For 350 caps yeah 
---
What level are you?
---
Any luck? I know many dupers who are not banned, and many innocent shop customers who did get banned. More than 10 that I know of on PS4 who didn’t dupe and only bought ammo and junk from dupers. No dev room involved. 
---
Bans seem to be going out in waves every morning so far - I know people who got banned Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and just now, Friday. 
---
Yea man I'm trying to build up my assassins build myself as most people I run into are good I can spot a griefer as their running around making bounties two at a time killing the other and getting others junk with no repercussions...
---
I like playing wasteland hero/white knight but when I see griefers hassling low levels destroying bases I want to hunt them down I guess that's my role-playing lol 
---
That being said if they start being attacked by mobs I will do add clean up then go back to killing them
---
It's my game I'll play how I want and truthfully I hate pvp but I will do it if I have to
---
I have armourer level 3 and fix it good level 3. Looking to craft ultra light on metal armour. I have all the materials in abundance too. Not sure what's going on. I also have a gun I want to upgrade and I'm have the same problem, I want to put hardened on a 10mm pistol, but all options are greyed out, I have all the required perk cards for that too. It's very weird and annoying!
---
Honestly if it’s gonna be a Fortnite like mode everybody would basically have to start from square one.
---
Dedication and Meth.
---
I can agree with that as well, I have the decency to put away my tse weapon when legendary farming with others around but of course there will always be that one guy who will one shot it not considering anyone else. 
---

"How much would you be willing to sell 3 x bulk screws and 3 x bulk concrete"
---
Oh the irony.
---
Hahaha jks 
---
No, I mean like, would you be willing to do 1,000 caps for 2,000 rounds. 
---
Best idea yet, how come nobody has thought of this previously, it's so goddamn obvious?! 
---
It would be easy enough to rejig the layout so that new players are completely separated from higher levels but can view the Vault 76 "plaza" through little windows to see everyone running about trading in their power armours and weird outfits etc. Reminds me of when they opened the Grand Exchange in my younger Runescape days... Maybe there should be a level cap/prerequisite prior to entry though, like after level 5 and completion of the Morgantown quests?
---
It has always baffled me why you cannot re-enter Vault 76 after leaving
---
Repairing Poseidon is a good event, it's cool to fix everything, turning it on, and providing electricity for the region. 
---
I would love to see events where you repair the elevator of the monorail (maby a series of missions) and so on
---
ok so i switched to a melee build for a few reasons. 
---
one would be its damage. i can 2 hit the glowing ones at whitesprings and i purposefully made it like that just so ranged players could get a shot in before it dies, so i hit it first and they kill it or they hit it first and i kill it. 
---
another would be ammo. i've tried many different builds and a fair few of em eat bullets faster than you can craft or find them. only builds i gained ammo was a crit sniper and a stealth shotgunner probably because everything died in 1 hit.
---
last reason i can think of (while not playing the game) would be because once you are spotted most of the time one or two enemies in the pack rush you because they are melee. 
---
edit. another reason is nuke zones. a fair chunk of my builds relied on armor and not being in power armor (or something like that) which really sucks when in nuke zones because you are forced to wear either a hazmat suit or power armor. i guess if you have a dedicated organized team you can run rad sponge 3 and share the perk and all run around as a team very close to each other. but how often does that happen when all my friends left the game long ago.
---
I am not a moderator here obviously but I think this might not violate rule 9 (maybe).
---
Thanks for the chuckle either way.
---
The story is that Vault tec didn't want Vault 76 to be used by the dwellers and life essential services have been shut down. They'd have to set up a big quest line explaining how we can get back in defying Vault tec and turning the services back on.
---
We really need something like it, it would help the community out so much. 
---
I never knew about the whole eBay side of it...Wow its  crazy &amp; such a scandal. 
---
Like 82ish. Dont really remember. 
---
Make Vault 76 Great Again
---
Hey, not trying to start the hate train, just saying it really looks like they don't understand the changes they are making. :(
---
No only 700
---
Maybe.  I only recently, finally got a two shot lever action and a two shot pump shotgun.  They've helped, but now they are about to be barely better than what I had.
---
It was harsh but that much of a drop is ridiculous and it was 100% of the original shot now they're making the second shot 20% of the damage of the first shot. I don't know where you got the 300% number
---
&gt;Building a big camp specifically designed to help other players and then getting the entire thing trashed by some asshole while you're away is the worst feeling.
---
That ain't gonna change.  they're leaving all the other bullshit in place.  Just adding a PvP mode to try and grab more of that FortNite $$.
---
Depends on how many pieces you stack, but its situational to pvp only so maybe, maybe not
---
No problem! As sad asa it sounds... it did make me chuckle, especially now watching all the dupers call me out on it haha.
---
I have 2 gear that have ultra light already. Crafted before the patch perfectly, only since the patch am I not able to. The gear o want to upgrade are identical, just for other parts of the body.
---
It’s not worthless but it isn’t OP, regardless of the damage numbers it can put up, when compared to TSE pre nerf. You still have to close that distance. Cripple the legs and rad them out with a Radium and they won’t even make it halfway. In close quarters it’s king though. I don’t see a balance issue YET and have killed a couple players using this but we will all see when the server drops
---
I don't prey on the weak. I put bullies using tse weapons to destroy others bases or to grief in other ways, in their places. And its as rare as any other two effects paired, just have to put in the farm time if you want to be op. Obviously it will loose effectiveness once people start learning to counter it, with stagger or poison or radiation
---
Mobs attack sometimes
---
You won't lose anything you just won't be able to move it to a full pvp mode, that'd be like playing a pve server in a game like ark or rust, getting set up and THEN moving to a pvp server.
---
This was my first thought. I would really love this. I prob won’t participate without this feature. There is no point in hoping on with some lvl 200 people 
---
Still no luck I feel like that is what had happened here. The duper’s arnt being punished just the people who are trading and may have bought duped merchandise. It’s a shame Bethesda was always one of my favorite developers and I can’t even get a response to 4 emails regarding this.
---
It's lost on people like the OP. Sucked into the propaganda that there are no NPCs in the game, when it's just really human NPCs. If it's not human, it's not an NPC.
---
Nothing like a bit of personality to spice up the wasteland though I see where your coming from 
---
Alright, sorry man. I’d like to do 2 rounds per cap.  But I’m sure a million and a half people have .45 just laying around. You’ll find someone, good luck. 
---
Guy has a point, MGS should have someone go through and ensure the weights add up right.
---
As a level 34 currently working on the quest....oops
---
Same way my hunting rifle weighs as much as your missile launcher.
---
I would much rather have something like this than a new PvP mode.
---
Every person who sells shit these days 80% chance if it’s good it has been duplicated. You’ve proved nothing. Except, maybe people want good items and they are pretty cheap so why not? I’d love to see your gear and tell us how you’ve not benefited from this duping you’re going all Nazi over. 
---
My bet?
---
Your gear is either fucking trash or you benefited from duper antics.
---
t(-_-t) tldr; get fucked it’s a game and if people want the good shit let um have it
---
Maybe he used to spend that much time on Pokemon Go.  So this might be considered an improvement.
---
Two shot does not one shot everything only the combination of the two. Even Explosive alone doesn't always on shot. Making my hard earned weapons (which are only two shot) worthless to appease a small percent of pvp players is absurd. 
---
Haha, this is genious... 😂😂
---
Yea I also thought it was one of the earlier quests you stumble across.
---
I think it was weight. One person who dumped got banned, And another who stored over 100k nuka grapes got it too. But Nina guy never duped, but he did look out.
---
He means the Veil has some sort of filtration technology built into it. 
---
I think it's just a glitch, it was probably supposed to be green.
---
And you're choosing to ignore logic and rational thinking. If you arent smart enough to think of the pros and cons of things and weigh them against each other then I dont expect you to make a valid argument. You're just crying for a nerf because something does a lot of damage and you dont like that. I will admit the armor pen perk needs to be 50% MAX because 75% is too much. But the weapons and mutations dont need a nerf
---
But they do take damage from certain builds and certain guns lol
---
I can give you a hand. 
---
I still one shot everything with my TSE guass... 2k damage... Idk what people are crying about lol
---
Others on this sub have stated that if someone DCs while fighting the queen, SBQ will fly out of bounds. I am guessing it would have to be someone high up on her aggro table. 
---
Ah true you didn’t. 
---
And IMO Warframe’s state is not great, but it is decent. I can’t agree because I left due to some problems with directions they took and I got irrational hate whenever I brought it up in the reddit.
---
But this is about 76. I think Bethesda is different from DE and Bethesda needs to hear it loud and clear and *unmitigated.* they’re actually stepping up more than they usually do for 76 so it’s important they hear it. Cause if we fail to and shove a bunch of people into a darkened thread to be ignored, it isn’t Bethesda who failed, it is us who failed.
---
i absolutely LOVE fighting the queen from there....it feels like that is how it SHOULD be. Definitely more fun than the 'usual' way where people gather around the shed.  Upvoting so more people see this and do it!
---
Thats kinda weird... if you are on PS4 I would just make sure that your ps4 storage isnt full first... if its not, then you are experiencing some horrible things 
---
From what i gathered something checks how much weight you have over all your characters lets say 5k-10k is the max going over this flags the account an bans it. several claims here have been made saying Bethesa does not keep item logs i was given this response when talking to support dont see why they would lie. Keeping a record of all character items considering these past months seems like an oversight they would make however seeing if players are over a certain weight is plausible. I know 2 people that duped that were not banned but another who did not dupe but was used as storage that was banned. 
---
I dont think they can tell what items are duped but if you have too much of something if you duped it bought it found it or something else it will likely trigger a flag an ban the account. This also applies to dev room items since those would be Id differently an can be traced leading to those bans.
---
Jesus has a job.  He's out to lunch, be back any time.
---
It still shoots two bullets but the dmg multiplier was lowered so each bullet does less dmg than a single shot weapon but combined they do more, it's kinda simple. And still great on shotguns and accurate weapons but it may hurt naturally inaccurate weapons 
---
Nice. I am going to get on in a few minutes to mess around until around 10.
---
&gt;Next, it should be free to fast travel to Hub 76 but if you are overemcumbered it will cost 1 cap per 2 lbs over your wt carry limit. So if you are 100 over your wt carry limit it will cost you 50 caps to fast travel to the hub from any place on the map. 
---
Somebody likes to walk around encumbered.
---
Idk but for at least the western revolver, the hardened is NOT the best receiver.
---
Ok guys, for the last time: Claw hands. And they have no fine pressure sensors.
---
Stop projecting.
---
*most damage
---
I have enough playtime to honestly believe nobody has the full set just from farming
---
Hope that's a typo and you mentioned 1.4k... if not your gonna be really sad when you see the market.
---
Haha! Awesome!
---
The game isnt about being high level. Play the game and enjoy it, make your own experiences and the levels will happen as you do
---
You need some more alu. I got this trouble yesterday when I crafted my shielded underarmor. Need 15 Gold had 16. Won't let me craft it. I produced some more gold (up to 24) and it works. I don't no why but it works. Look that your crafting materials are min. 5 more in you inventory as needed 
---
And you arent smart enough to see that I don't actually want any nerfs at all. Look at the way the post was written. It was just to make a point.
---
And yet none of these replies are a video, just stories...
---
They didnt nerf it yet.
---
With the next patch 
---
They only do that when stacked with buffs that work for guns too. The problem is stacking buffs.
---
I liked the idea of Multiplayer Fallout game but what they did is barely a game. It is more like a collection of old bugs and new ones put together in one big monstrous mess. The fact that many parts of Bethesda worked on the game at the same time didn’t help at all. Don’t get me wrong, some things in the game are very well done but the massive amount of issues is making them feel insignificant (eg. why do we need a huge world where we can walk around and not meet any Npc’s or enemies for hours or the fact that we have so many beautifully made weapons but they feel useless because they don’t have proper mods etc.). IMO We paid full price and we deserved a finished product and Bethesda barely got away from a class action law suit. Their reputation is ruined and probably beyond repair. I hope I am wrong.
---
Well.....it hasn't been nerfed yet sooooo........
---
Its not rare at all, I get them all the time.
---
Is this an alt?
---
I think with xbox I find it to be suuuuper quiet. I hardly ever hear random sounds of people talking. When it does happen it's funny to eavesdrop. Might just be me but I kind of crave the interaction as it is lonely playing solo in the wasteland.
---
Part of it is when people group in the xbox system then it mutes their in-game chat so that they don't hear people trying to talk to them in-game either. 
---
Not really. Everyone has the same opportunities.
---
I'd advise not rushing the game. You're only sprinting towards a crawl.
---
If you don't believe me, look at a TON of posts of people complaining about end game stuff being non-existent or it being too grindy.
---
You're an idiot, you literally said in your post that they need a nerf. Look at your own post genius
---
Someone is on the list then.
---
Just go play ARK, Rust, DayZ or any of the myriad of late 2015 survival games. IMHO survival games with PVP are too full of assholes griefing and using the "but it would happen IRL" cry to justify their griefing because they are able to be online 17 hours straight and simply steamroll newbies.
---
Sure the events of the war and what a person is exposed to in FO76 after leaving the Vault would crack some people but honestly most people in that situation would go find their Vault mates from the last 25 years. Not go shoot them with a bobble head powered whatever-replaces-TSE-shotguns. 
---
Then don't?
---
PVE and casual are not the same thing.  Accusing me of being emotional and attacking me personally are not an adequate replacement for thoughtful arguments.  I've explained my side thoroughly, and even sympathized with your situation while providing a solution that would make everyone happy.  All you've done is call me casual, unimaginative, and cowardly.  I have to conclude that you don't actually have any thoughtful arguments and will just keep doing that.
---
It's ridiculous to blame PVE players for not participating in PVE.  They don't want to.  They're PVE players.  Bethesda knew they would play.  You knew they would play.  Only players completely new to Fallout wouldn't have, but they know now.  It was unavoidable, but this mishmash of PVE and PVP wasn't.  And now they have to fix it after launch, instead of having it dealt with before.  You ignore the simple and effective solution of dedicated PVE and PVP server, and are instead pushing a variant of "git gud."
---
That's the entirety of your argument.  So I'm done since you have nothing to add beyond more personal attacks.  There are more reasonable players in this reddit, they're not all "hardcore," at least not in the way you're implying they are.  Even if they are bored and frustrated with the current state of the game, they realize it's the game that's the problem, not the players who won't stop doing what they enjoy to provide them entertainment.
---
Bloodied nerf would hit ranged hard too. Seems to me the +damage per strength point is more of an issue with the low health melee builds.
---
No, you stop it right now op. Don't open the Pandora's box... Next thing we know there will be human NPC settlements, then....
---
There will be Preston....
---
They have yet to abandon their fascist leanings, which is partially understandable being that they were still under the regime until the late 70's/ early 80's
---
Or maybe we should paste the link to the YouTube video explaining this easy cheat so anyone who needs anything isn’t paying this rat. 
---
Go rot 
---
This but also who knows if Bethesda comes out with a balance patch regarding this after the dust settles on TSE.
---
DOT likely Department of Transportation, so concrete for roads, rather than foundations (like your C.A.M.P.)
---
Actually I have both an x01 Jetpack and an x01 stealthboy. I'll have to try this.
---
You have to be up close and personal with melee, and many are running bloodied builds which means their health has to be low for max damage. It's risk vs reward. 
---
We need more large events like defend this town from a massive invading horde. Like defending a workshop but way larger scale.
---
Could base it off a couple large waves with it ending with a few juiced up bosses.
---
&gt; Having no way stop somebody that's attacking you, or to stop people from destroying your camp IS being forced into it.
---
Log off?
---
Still what ever the nerf is it's still gonna do rediculous damage, even cut in half.
---
I know it would hit range hard as well and I thought about that. The damage bonus from melee would be a better nerf, I do agree there. But if they’re going to nerf range builds, they’re going to have to do something about melee builds. 
---
Darn. The cave is a little too small for me to make the kind of CAMP I want to make. I'm just going to forgo a resource node and build at the bottom of the little waterfall south of Lake Eloise.
---
Thanks for getting back to me!
---
That happened to me a week ago too.
---
Do you realise how low your iq is? Ignorance must be bliss
---
Ok, well still even at 50% it's a 1k shot 😁
---
So it is, somehow I missed it and just responded when going through replies lol
---
Betcha  bethesda wouldn't agree, they are the law
---
Those two weapons rather need more durability. With 200% durability, Gunsmith and Luck perk that has slight chance to repair weapon, TSE minigun lasts what, 1500 rounds? And that is like nothing to SBQ.
---
Play either of those 2 games for a bit then come back and tell me that that'd be fair 
---
PC, same thing happened to me last night. It was the first time I had tried the elevator in the elevator. Came here to make bug report.
---
Go on....even if I had (which I'm certain I did not)...message you....wtf is asking for 3x screw and concrete? 
---
about 30 lead spot on the map few of them shader with junk or steel/cooper. so u can have both at once. and about perk cards i 130ih curently and i have about 30 unspen points already.
---
Yea thats why I wrote TSE in my title. Not only two shot.
---
Why are they worthless? TS gives +25% dmg and Explosive gives +20% dmg now. Sounds good to me.
---
So you are upset because you havent found a weapon yet with both effects on it? I dont quiet get what you mean
---
You gonna get banned for witch hunting.... Hahahaha....
---
*Sierra liked that.*
---
And I wont
---
This seems reasonable. I'd also like to see my perk cards in an entirely different format. The whole side scrolling thing makes little sense when you've got 100+ cards to look through.
---
This. And I spawn near a river and it takes a good 30 seconds for the water to spawn after I’m in the world. I’d also rather wait at the loading screen until the game is ready. 
---
I'm ok with the the nerf.  First off, tse weapons were duped into oblivion.  I've seen them just sitting in world boxes. So the most op set of perks on the most op guns ended up in most of the player bases inventory. The game is suppose to be hard. It's suppose to take a long time to find good weapons and armor. Not walk out the vault to a guy with 100,000 pounds of weapons to choose from. It's Bethesdas fault for allowing it to happen and not fixing stuff sooner, but it's also the player bases fault for taking the easy way out of everything......this is why we can't have nice things. Lol. Rant over. I guess. 
---
Was just coming here to see if anyone was doing them... I'm down
---
I'm gonna farm some fusion cores for a bit. What's your psn?
---
Horrible indeed and i have plenty of space in my storage
---
I can direct you to this thread where there is a breakdown on armor penetration [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a3olmm/antiarmor\_sledgehammer\_and\_normal\_sledgehammer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a3olmm/antiarmor_sledgehammer_and_normal_sledgehammer/)
---
happens on ps4 as well.
---
Ironically....I didn't know trolling was so short sighted on Reddit.
---
lol I do but at most 100 over limit and that goes down once i can scrap stuff.  50 caps is doable for me but a duper with 500,000 TSe weapons will not be able to afford the trip.
---
So damn loud right away
---
Wich leanings and tendencies would that be?
---
As far as I know, there's a socialist government there.
---
I can agree with this, but TSE is not without risk despite how strong it is. I kill myself every 10-15 minutes because 3rd person aiming shoots a wall in front of me and insta-kills me, and the accuracy of TSE both in and outside of V.A.T.S is pretty horrendous. 
---
Awesome
---
Man I agree with you but here is a freaking Snickers you hangry brother 😂
---
Think so too, at least they improved the fireproof perk too. It gives now - 45% less dmg from explosions. Really excited to see the difference of the dmg
---
This is definitely what people claim, and stacking bobbleheads needs to be fixed asap, but I've still never seen evidence of it actually happening.
---
Yet I *have* seen video of a guy who stacked bobbleheads to get his explosive shotgun to 240,000 damage and was still doing like 5 points of slap damage.
---
So I'll believe it when I see it.
---
I would love this.  It would be like the tower in Destiny.
---
For the love of Christ.  
---
After three characters I finally get a two-shot weapon. My only one, too. A two-shot **gatling** gun and not a one of my characters are leveled for heavy gun usage. So I start a fourth and have it up to level 30 something just so I can use the *one god damned interesting legendary weapon I've gotten in like two hundred hours and you're going to fucking nerf it?* I get junky golf clubs and nocturnal rolling pins and quad 44 revolvers and the one weapon I get that has actually piqued my interest...  
---
Get fucked, Bethesda. It's not even the two-shot that's what is broken, it's the god damned explosive property that's fucking broken. Even with Stabilized this fucking gun is going to have the accuracy of a palsy sufferer trying to thread a fucking needle and you're going to go and nerf it?  
---
You sons of bitches, I'm so tempted to uninstall the fucking game.
---
If your running a shotgun or heavy gun TSE build it works with meleee. To maximize even more you’d have to switch 3 cards when you roll into a nuke zone. Example shogunner 3, expert and master for doing a queen run.....whitesprings line up that slugger to 3 on all (no need to use your shotgun maxed out since everything dies in 1-2 shots )
---
As a 30+ office worker, I understand this robot in a painted suit.
---
Let him have his childhood...if even for a minute. ;_;
---
If you want less buget don’t use turrets they cost way to much for there uses
---
They still have one of the best legendaries in the game.  Just because people decided to grind hundreds of hours for an item doesn't mean that item doesn't need to be balanced with the rest of the game.  If those people who grinded 100's of hours for these weapons lacked the foresight to see that they would be nerfed in the future then that's on them.  This is an online game, and as such it needs balance.  A single player Fallout game could get away with such an overpowered weapon, because it doesn't effect other people and provides no unfair disadvantages to other players.  In an online game an overpowered item destroys the balance of the game and puts other players who haven't found such an item at a severe disadvantage.  
---
This all common sense to anyone who has ever played an online game.  Balancing sweeps are common, and as a player you should expect them, not resent them when they happen.
---
Its satirical idiot. 
---
True it really is better but it won't be as good idk y they don't just put it to 50 percent instead of 25
---
Its still stand there and hit you make it sound difficult.  My melee build wrecks stuff so much easier then my perception build. I'm pretty sure it's just pandering to the loudest community complaining about everything.  I agree tse needed a slight nerf because a jump of 500 damage to 1500 damage flat at full hp is a bit of a bump. But perception builds can also use nerd rage and addreline to do the same risk vs reward.
---
Posts like this are going to get everything nerded, the Queen  will live forever (because no-one will be able to kill her) and humanity will die.  Next thing we will see is, nerd the cryolaters!  They freeze everything.
---
People need to stop crying about being one shotted, this game is mainly PVE. Ive never been shot at once. Stop trying to ruin it for everyone. Personally I feel some weapons should one shot people. Most games you get one shot sniped.  I dont see the reason to nerf anything. 
---
No, we do not need to make a fairly easy game even easier....
---
Wear a Dense or Padded armor mod, or use Fireproof. Makes you very resistant to explosives. You'll probably still cripple yourself, but you won't die. 
---
Most TSE users I see are Marsupials, so they just hop away most of the time.

Base PS4. Tried and true works with every other game. HDR and everything.

One guy who duped got hit.....so did his lookout. Think its how much mule weight you had. Looking store over 100k nuka grapes....
---
Sell it soon cause its getting nerfed (i dont want just saw the offer)
---
No it's not, you're just trying to cover up the fact that you screwed up. Pathetic attempt
---
unless you vats. then you can leap at someone with marisupial in close prox
---
I first heard about it regarding jetpacks so hopefully. If it does work you gotta try the ones that. Reduce AP usage that might let you fly way higher and longer 
---
Not even have to search. Just scroll down and you see all these damn explosive posts. Mod/admin needs to clear them out because theyre taking up space for actual informative posts. 
---
Nope. Bethesda has said nothing about people who bought them. Only poeple who duped.
---
that is not addicative. it is multicative.
---
As a non-explosive TS/non-TS explosive user (i.e. I have TS guns and Explosive guns, but not TSE guns), I'm not really happy about the nerf. The effects when used *on their own* aren't terribly OP in comparison to default weapons (except some explosive weapons), they just give people like me an extra edge against the high level bullet sponges, perfect for the endgame.
---
When these effects are combined however, they are obviously ridiculously overpowered; they're boosting weapon damage by well over 200% when combined with various perks and chems, even *low level* TSE shotguns are more powerful than most LVL 45 weapons. I'm with the group of people who'd like to see TSE damage nerfed, but not when the effects are used by themselves, because it's punishing players who aren't even using TSE guns.
---
I'm not gonna name names, but I think somebody didn't read the "inside the vault"...
---
You're just going to shorten the play time for the game. But if all you really want to do is hit the same three places (over and over again) looking for God's own weapon, then sure, head to Whitespring. No judgement.
---
Huh? What do you mean?
---
I've been a bunch and I'm under-50.
---
They're nerfing the two shot affect where the second bullet adds 25% damage compared to the 100% now. And the same with the explosive effect. So it's a 125% rampage reduction on weapons with the two shot and explosive effects. If I remember it right. It's in the "inside the vault" article on Bethesda site. 
---
Not much just wandering the ash heap looking for excavator mods. What's up with you?
---
I have to disagree with you, I regularly use a two shot 50 Cal with stabilized 3 perk and it has trouble hitting enemies at range. The accuracy difference between a regular 50cal and two shot is pretty big.
---
Weird this hasn't been fixed yet. 
---
If I could upvote this a million times I would. I have had no fewer than 50+ hard crashes since the Jan 15 update. I’ve taken to just leaving dirty messages in the PS4 report a problem menu because I am tired of reporting that the game crashed for no reason.  I have tried reinstalling the game, restarting my PS4, and so on and so forth. I have no idea why it is happening to me because my wife plays right next to me with her identical PS4 bought a month earlier than mine and she has had no hard reset issues.  All I can think of is the game cannot render the environment fast enough and crashes out because it seems like it seems to do it mostly in high graphics intense areas.  I have played God of War to the end on this system with no issues whatsoever. So Bethseda what is the issue?
---
You soming very rare theys days
---
A bug free game
---
Yesss. I am happy for it in all honesty. I'm fine with my rifle still hitting heavy and with sneak and crits I know it'll still one shot. But I like the challenge of multiple shots from my HM going forward.
---
Btw was the announcement in and inside the vault or somewhere else?
---
I fucking love it. The game is getting cleansed of shitheads
---
I have. They arent the same. In this one everyone has equal opportunities on those alphas take over servers so others cant get to certain resources and get wiped. The 2 aren't comparable.
---
They should make a central hub in the center regions of the map... like a failed delta silo.... or perhaps something more like whitesprings bunker
---
I know several people who got banned that were not overweight or over stash weight on any characters. 
---
There are probably many different criteria they are using. It is odd that people with 20 million pound inventories escaped the banhammer though.
---
Do you want the clamps? Because thats how you get clamps.
---
Don't get a massage from one.
---
They did nerf the cryolators already for freezing everything lol. 
---
Sorry, I have absolutely no experience with consoles after the original xbox.
---
Weapon variety is low  - What game are you playing? Besides weapons, there's armor, chems,  ammo, plans, recipes, mods, apparel to sell. I can't wait for player trading.
---
&gt; that way you at least know they're going somewhere
---
The extra money is probably what pays for the robot army at Whitesprings. Damn sneaky robots are using our hard-earned money to start the robot uprising. :D
---
This is ironic....
---
Oh, I see where this is going. 
---
But the Catalan Police are fairly aggressive and authoritarian towards the people too. Does Catalonia have fascist leanings and tendencies too?
---
And again, as far as I know, the State Police is almost non-existent in that region of Spain. When they act, is because a Judge orders them to do so; such was the case with the recent events.
---
How is that fascist, when you have an independent power such as the judicial power telling the police what to do?
---
the nerf  for TS will be +25% weapon dmg instead of 100%(-75%)
---
for Explosives it will be 20% instead of 100%(-80%)
---
That should still put me upwards of 800-900. I can live with that. Sneak and crits can still get me my one shot.
---
Ive got 240 hours in the game, only found two explosive weapons (one which I sold). 
---
I've got a .45 explosive combat rifle, its good, but definitely not overpowered, gets the job done but definitely situational, and now its gonna get nerfed into oblivion. 
---
The one time in all those hours that luck smiled upon me will now be undone, neato.
---
Try the bazaar or marketplace but you will have to drop it to 1.5k ish to get it to sell.
---
I dont actually want a nerf. You have the right reaction, this was to make the point of how silly this move was on Bethesdas part.
---
Yeah but it's clean so clean face mask
---
Well it’s either that or lock people to servers.
---
Jellyfish brain having ass
---
Something different but along the same idea happened to me a couple days ago.  I actually dropped a frame with armor pieces to give to someone.  He took it, but it looked to me like he just stripped it.  The frame was still standing there.  If I hit transfer, it came up as an empty frame, not as a loading one.  The thing is, none of the other players around me could see or interact with it.  I jumped on top of it and stood there.  The other players saw me as levitating and could run right under me through the frame.  I confirmed that my friend indeed had picked up the entire frame and it was in his inventory.
---
Something does need rebalanced here, yes. I picked a lock on a toolbox that was apparently inside the build area of a workshop; a toolbox thats always there wether a player owns the WS or not. As a result I'm now wanted; but if I instead go into that same workshop and instead murder its inhabitats...not wanted?
---
I'm gonna be down that road this year probably with the new rtx 2060. It looks like a really good price for performance
---
Then they need to put in some effort. Obsidian at least tried in NV with how some of the stronger wildlife was structured. Cazadores scared off new players easily with their insane poison. Thing is that once you actually take in their traits (literally no armor, wings can be cripped in one shot generally, tend to be in groups) you can then destroy them with shotguns, full autos, and explosives at range.
---
Baldur's Gate also did it well with enemies that went from hell to much easier if you used the proper spells and skills against them.
---
You'd be lucky if you got 1k for it
---
I hate that this may be the only option
---
Didn't realize the health scales. That makes a lot of sense, I took her down with a group of 4 randoms last night, nobody with particularly elite weapons just spamming heavy guns when she was in the air and melee/explosives when she landed. Granted it took 25 minutes and I used 17 stimpacks, but we did it with 4 people. I guess that makes sense now that I know her health scales based on the # of people around. 
---
lmao😂 Its been 1 month hahha
---
Don't ask for a handjob from one
---
Could you dump those duped ass piece of shits in a lake on your way out?
---
I would just like some more end game bosses like the SBQ or more challenging events that require a bit of effort or strategy to complete.
---
Question for you. I gather you are on PS4 from comments. Pro or regular? Myself and one team mate have Pro's, we blue screen with a fair amount of regularity. Though it does seem session dependant. Sometimes we find a really stable session and last for hours. 
---
Our other team mate has an older PS4 a non Pro version. He very rarely bluescreens. 
---
More than that, they sell for around 3k and that’s on the high end. 
---
My experience with 2 shot snipers is they are extremely innacurate in vats to the point of being nearly unusable.  I know vats isn't a huge deal with most sniping but when you want to take that vats shot and it says 95% and misses everytime its frustrating.  My 2 shot sniper is in storage and only comes for very specific locations.

---
They appear in the roboco robot factory when doing the mayor for a day quest. 
---
Events are cool, but 90% of them give rewards that are worth nothing to the average player. Plus, the cost of fast travel to the event means you're actually losing money and gaining nothing if you participate. 
---
&gt; There are some people that want a more suspenseful challenging experience.
---
And there are people who shove sharp objects up their urethra, doesn't mean it's a great fucking idea just because **some** people want it.
---
What is your psn? I might be on
---
Calm down, it's all good, I have the very lowest IQ, you have a high one, all is well.
---
Ok bud. What ever you say. I dont feel the need to prove it to you. Youre wrong and nothing you say, do, or think will make you right. This is my last reply to you as you are to dense to have a conversation with. 
---
Ill never forgive Bethesda for not making KLE0 a companion/romance option in Fallout 4. NEVER!
---
**I don't care if it wouldn't work!**

Good idea maybe even put it in the settings similar to another game *name I cant remember possibly Lego*

Make this pvp and the alphas like in those games are the level 200s one shot killing on sight. Better to just start people off evenly. You can't stack while not worrying about pvp, then take that loot to shit on people in pvp, that'd ruin any potential this mode has
---
Thank god I still have an instagating explosive tesla I can still tool around with.  Better get to it before it they jack that up.
---
I don't mind that items/ennemies respawn, cause the game would have been empty for a long time now otherwise, but I agree : we need persistence.
---
I've thought about that too. A few things I would suggest is : when you log in a server, if the workshop you possessed when you logged off aren't claimed by anyone, you get them back, in their current state. That would already help : your fast travel network/material sources would be there.
---
The factions would bring some persistence too, as the building/repairments would be "permanent" on that server, so you could hop on a server where Camden Park is fully functionning for instance (long range shot here, it's an illustration)
---
I have experienced quicker fusion core drainage last night. (I'm not using any PA or Fusion Cores related perks).
---
I will check again tonight.

I never said that
---
Side note if you really want to access the monorail you can start from south mountain lookout area and walk towards the south heading towards the tracks and theres a a down tree branch the connects the clif edge to the tracks. Then you can very carefully walk the monorail track until you reach the old station 
---
I just want some sport back in the game. I bought some duped tse's (handmade and lever). Ended up getting a 3* tse 44 at awol armaments event so I sold the lever and handmade and respected my character to be unarmed/pistol out of my suit and two hand/pistol in my suit. Something just didn't feel special about the lever and handmade when I would trade with other people and they had the exact same guns as me. In a game that's suppose to be full of unique and diverse weapons and builds, it kinda sucks to see such a strong meta emerge. Not to mention what two shot explosive shotguns did to whitesprings nukes. Not even worth going to when 1 or 2 guys are one shotting entire mobs. 
---
I knew I wasn't crazy! That must be a big right? I figured my game was just bugged.
---
You would only be prolonging the inevitable in that case. But you cant take over a server in this game like those becauae you go to a new server everyday. Not the same.
---
It's interesting, but making it every day all on your own is a bite tiresome. 
---
They are also incredibly-inclined toward breakage, and their ability to shoot rapidly makes that worse. You can shoot two full magazines out of some configurations to take them from 100% to 0%.
---
Excpet that they are nerfinf the explosove part of that by 80%
---
that was a realy nice point of view ;)
---
It's also common sense to everyone that Nerfs are a component of PvP games and that is why nobody wanted PvP in this game in the first place.
---
Nobody even plays PvP......just make a fortnight 76 server and be done with it.
---
You people need to find something else to do in the game other than camp out at Whitesprings golf club. Try wandering through cranberry bog solo.
---
Don't rush into it.
---
Play it cool, do events/quests, explore, kill monsters. rinse and repeat.
---
Have a nice day boo
---
No, no, i insist, it's quite obvious !
---
Few Questions: 
---
-Do you use VATS allot?  
---
-Do you Sprint Allot?  
---
-Do you "Power Attack" or hold breath allot?  
---
-Do you use a Stealthboy?  
---
All of these eat AP, which turns into massive Core Drains, if you have the related perks, you can decrease the effect, but Fusion cores are lasting significantly less since the last patch.
---
This. HUGE warning message pops. "ARE YOU SURE? ITS PVP"
---
Nice. I posted this same question on FilthyCasuals a few weeks ago...
---
Vivian Vitruvian- Ny main. The Overseer's best friend. She is the only one the Overseer really trusts for her secret mission and spent the time in the Vault subtly assigning Vivian to jobs that would prepare her for the mission ahead. (This backstory is to basically explain away the idea of why the story missions only seem to address one "main" protagonist- even if that one person is paradoxically all of us)
---
Larry- The 1st baby born in the Vault. He was always pushed to the greatness he was supposedly destined for. Turns out he is just the definition of average- though he does try to be better. (Strait even 8s across his SPECIAL) 
---
Solarious Vox- Soldier that has undergone high levels of genetic engineering during the Alaskan Occupation. Head of security in the Vault. Now he just wants to rid the world of all the abominations. (With faction type stuff coming, I just wanted to make a Brotherhood type character. And to stop around the Wasteland acting like an Ultramarine) 
---
Nora Nitro- My raider character from FO4. (Only lvl 6. Havnt come up with a real backstory yet) 
---
Grognak- Pretty self-explanatory though I havnt decided if he is some Vault Dweller that thinks he is the real Grognak for some reason or if he is the "real" Grognak that somehow got pulled out of the comics using hand waved unobtainium related science. (In an ultimate nerd move I made a new PSN account just to display the correct name to everyone.  Or as close as I could get after like 40 variations. Want to smash shit with me? Hit me up at: G_R_0_G_N_A_K_. The o is a zero)
---
Wood should not be used as armour unless you're fighting in a world where the only weapon is harsh language. Even then it's a stretch to think it would be effective.
---
Yeah it's the easy route which is why I think that's the option they'll choose, but it seems to take Bethesda inordinate amounts of time to get anything done which is why I don't think it will likely happen right away.  Look how long it took to nerf TSE, and all they're doing is  lowering the % for both affixes.
---
Sorry to hear that. I think there is a way to stop jerks from doing that.

---
The change from Scrap to Ore is was unneeded, and adds a extra, unneeded layer of grindiness.  
---
I think changing the Ore back to scrap would be exceptional
---
Have you turned on Pacifist mode?  This helps.  Also, did you takeover any workshops?  
---
Looks like he got his ratchet and clank on
---
I'm not saying it's a bad idea, I'm just wondering what kind of functionality a player hub adds that isn't there.
---
Based on what you've described, we have a location like that already - Whitesprings.
---
It's just like when people suggested this up and down for Sea of Thieves - I was always left asking... why? What would it do that you just couldn't do anyways?
---
As a place to socialize? I can't imagine I'd have fun at least personally standing around *in a video game* doing little to nothing other than talking to people. There's plenty of time to talk while killing stuff.
---
As a place to meet other players to trade? If Whitesprings isn't good enough, you can meet players anywhere on the map and travelling virtually anywhere is quick and easy.
---
I guess I just don't get what a certain area marked a "social hub" would do. I get how the design works in a game like Destiny, but this game simply isn't set up that way.
---
So what's stopping most servers you join from having players like that? Yes you're switching servers but it shouldn't be between no pvp and full pvp. And why not postpone the inevitable instead of day one condemning the new mode?
---
Yeah, stealth in the SBQ event can be dicey unless you're hiding in a tree and no SB see you with their true sight abilities. You go from "yeah, I'm doing a little damage" to "oh, I'm about to get my ass handed to me by this 98 Scorched Deathclaw and his crew because no matter I can't get stealthed and this hunter's rifle isn't cutting the mustard now." Also, when your gauss weapon stops firing even though you charged it up.
---
It's the carebear's.
---
For straight up damage increase, the Strength [Shotgunner] perks will increase the base damage of the shotgun. 
---
{I also recommend Perception [Skeetshooter] for better spread}. 
---
As for mods that increase damage, Hardened receiver is the way to go on all shotguns.
---
Except 95% of legendary affixes are garbage
---
Oh I don’t know...... maybe..... Furious, Anti Armor, Bloodied, instigating, Nocturnal, 25% fire rate, vats crit, vats refill, 25% less VATS
---
I’ve played for 200+ hours and never found a TSE. You probably didn’t either. 99.9% of TSE weapons are duped
---
The cheaters duped the wrong fucking guns
---
Ha! I'm glad someone bit. 
---
i agree with this, but they first actually have to fix any ways of duping and add a way to track items, because it's inevitable that new methods will arise with new patches
---
Well you wouldn’t piss off a big fish, gotta get them little guppies and feel safe after. 
---
Please, more !
---
Have you run the Scan and Repair in the Options section of the Bethesda Launcher?  That usually fixes my client crashes to desktop.
---
there's a difference between one shotting everything from a distance and one hitting everything from up close. depending on where mobs are at, a melee user could easily take three times as long to kill trash vs somebody using a tse handmade who can swap from enemy to enemy without changing position 
---
Im pretty sure that is bugged it only effects the guns base weight the mods add extra. I see this in armor all the timr. I have  weightless  heavy metal legs.
---
one does 20% less weight to weapons  +1 str other is weightless ans 20% less weight on food meds with +1 str. Both of them are less then 1 carry weight due to weightless, if i add the mods to drop weight they actually weigh more, so i just shoved deep pockets on them. 
---
Ive tested the weapon weight with just unmodded weapons and it works fine, add mods and the mods base is just added to the mod without a reduction.
---
I'm more than willing to give of my OP build so I can feel even with the people I'm competing against, way more fun that way.
---
Sigh. Thats sad.
---
You can't talk about PvP with carebear's
---
I feel like you were just humoring me, but I'll take it!
---
I just take the 5 seconds it takes to put them down and do it myself. 
---
I think you underestimate the playerbase. Mlst people,aren't trolls on here.
---
War. War never changes.
---
Damn right! Plus it adds ballistic damage even though the stat screen is bugged for explosive legendaries, as seen here. I believe this means it benefits from stabilized for armor penetration. Correct me if I’m wrong.
---

It does. Ive been trying for the longest time to get my 5 piece setup to see if it does the same as in FO4. Last week I finally aquired my fifth piece and its the best. With all sneak perks w/ full agility and full chameleon armors they cant find me at all. I go into caution and they shoot in my general area but never hit or go into danger. Even had super mutants run right up to me and they didnt do anything. One time I loaded into a group of 5-6 scorched and they didnt see me either with a couple bumping into what could only have been an invisible lump to them. 
---
It happened to me 2 times now, both the Yao guai that I needed to shoot with karma
---
Is furious in vats only or does it work outside of vats? 
---
That may sound good to you but not to me. Im upset because my weapons that are only two shot wil do significantly less damage. Its literally taking away 75% of the damage output. How is that hard to understand?
---
You gotta give a few examples of what these bad suggestions were. Then we'd have something to discuss.
---
The thing is, some things about this game could use simplifying and streamlining, if they are boring and tedious, but don't add any challenge. That's the thing about making a good game - developers have to ask themselves, before adding a feature to the game, "is this going to make the game more interesting, more challenging, more fun?" If the answer is no, or not necessarily, then arguably the feature doesn't belong.
---
For example, the current hunger and thirst. It REALLY doesn't add anything to the game. At all. It's not fun, it's not challenging, it's not interesting. Food and water is too damn easy to come by. It's just something you carry, or grow/farm specifically for specific bonuses that you want, such as glowing meat food that gives +10% melee damage. So I absolutely agree that it needs to change. Having to feed your character every 10 mins of gameplay doesn't actually add quality gameplay, it's just busy work. Will it make the game easier? Yes, but if the ease comes from reducing pointless tedium, it's worth it.
---
As somebody who's level 75 and only seems to get legendary wood armor and ghoul slayer melee weapons I'm starting to lose interest in the game because of the lack of good drops...
---
I wouldn't have even known TSE was a thing if I didn't visit this site...  I don't even want them removed but maybe a check on variety.  If I get one more legendary war drum I'm gonna scream.
---
#FREEWOOBY
---
if they wait too long for private servers, there will be too many players who have finished the game.
---
Lots of people wanted PvP in the game, which is why they are adding a PvP-always-on mode.  If people didn't want it they wouldn't be going that route.
---
Just do Mayor for a Day in Watoga to get All Rise.  With the right perks it’s 200.

I’m genuinely surprised that this isn’t a thing already. Why spend all that time making an area so fully detailed to never be accessed again. It’s such an odd design choice. 
---
I wasn't aware either. And yes, no bounties on my head, I've never been wanted. 
---
I would agree, but I would also say that this "quirk" (to put it charitably) has existed for quite a while in several of their games.  It's like they don't support interrupts.  Reloading your gun, or the game deciding that you wanted to swing your Super Sledge again rather than receive that Stimpack you're mashing the button to get, really comes across like a terribly misguided, intentional design decision rather than a bug at this point.
---
He's upset because now his weapon with only one or the other is garbage. Nerf TSE, but to ruin legitimately acquired non op weapons is bullshit.
---
Yay, a whole 25% more damage for an endgame weapon. Now instead of 275 dmg a shot, it does 325 (or whatever). Woo. 
---
Yup its a great feeling lol.
---
they both hsve pros and cons
---
pro for tse: one shot everything except for queen,have superior range,if you have shotgun you can kill pasif players without initiatimg pvp( sp ive heard) 
---
Cons for Tse: to close to you instant death 
---
Pros for Melee: one or 2 shot everything except queen,can almost always win a pvp fight in close or medium range as long as they dont have Tse, can hit people in close proximity with marisupial if you use vats
---
Cons: cant win long distant pvp fights,have to be close range so you take more damage than gunners,if you hit someone trying to initiate pvp they can wait till you get a certain distamce away from you to start shooting you for pvp
---
You get to fuck a Robobrain in Far Harbor. It'd probably work
---
They can cry about it thought....
---
Because of slap damage, guarantee it'll be different without. Not to mention playing since beta I've ran into plenty of trolls, but trolls aren't the problem, accounts with duped items are. Hence the need for a fresh start.
---
Hahahha
---
I started a new character at launch and play 3-4 days a week for a few hours each time and I am also around lvl 70.
---
I also don't care about twitch/streaming etc. Why watch a stream when you can play instead? 
---
Overall I also have no need for the game to be more difficult. Harder stuff does not make a game more fun for me. I like to explore and find things and experiment with different builds.
---
Ahh I see, sorry im just upset.
---
Yeah I just read, that is a fearsome nerf... But in the end I think it's good.
---
two shot is being nerfed to 25% dmg instead of 100% and explosive is nerfed to 20% instead of 100%.
---
Why are people saying that only having one of those effects makes the weapon useless lmao
---
Agree as well. However, DO NOT proceed as some failed trade systems have and make eveyone's sale items separate shops. Final Fantasy 14 phail bussed this trying to avoid a single auction house listing. Checking every individual inventory for the item or deal your looking for sucks. 
---
Unfortunately either way will never stop the rmt crowd from under cutting and selling caps for real money. 
---
If you're looking at shops or a mark3t, why not use Whitesprings as the base? There's already vendors and work benches there, just a little tweaking and it could be a the hub your after
---
Particularly shotguns will be barely improved by two-shot now, since the drawback of two-shot is an accuracy reduction that particularly impacts shotgun spread. You're going to get double pellets (half of which do one-quarter damage), but fewer will hit the target. You will do more damage up close, but it's possible to do less damage at a distance. And of course those one-quarter pellet hits are still ripping through your weapon's durability.
---
I'm not but if I wasn't banned I probably would be,easy good items
---
You are just going to get OP again.

The Sir Mutes-a-lot mutation. Negates fall damage (cause you're landing on your bubble butt) but gives -3 Agility (cause you're always bumping into stuff with your big dumpy).

&gt;Griefing 
---
is abusing game mechanics in a way that isnt intended, the block mechanic is to hide people from bothering you, not the other way around while you stalk them. 
---
i would say it takes common sense to determine who is and isnt griefing but clearly common sense isnt so common. 
---
Because a major end game weapon only gives an extra 25%. Meh. "End game" indeed. 
---
I’d be fine if they gave us an incentive to use some of the enemy specific legendaries. 
---
Ghoul slayer’s is decent I guess if you’re running white springs and don’t have anything better. But hunter’s, exterminator’s, troubleshooter’s I just sell or throw in the closest trash can. 
---
We did have a workshop at the start but we gave it up to them and they kept following us even as far as our camp to kill us. We didnt have pacifist on though, thanks for the suggestion 
---
I totally agree with OP. Every second post is about making things more convenient or easier. The game is already extremely easy and non-punishing. Ran out of things to do weeks ago.
---
The Two Shot and Explosive nerfs are steps in the right direction. It would be awesome, but too late now, to have perk cards matter by makign them less easy to swtich around. This would create roles in a party and make decision a bit more impacting.
---
Wayne. Mine worker pre war, watched the bombs fall before running deep into belching Betty, hardly escaping the blast. Now scarred and deformed by the nuclear heat and collapsing mine shaft. After the bombs fell, when the vaults were all locked up for the “pretty folk” to wait out the horror, Wayne became increasingly invested in this new world. Where there were once complacent lifestyle and underworked citizens, there is now struggle, and work, and a whole bundle of problems. Where there was once horrible cruelty, there was now a universal love (or perhaps a universal hate for everything that happened in the last few years) that would bind even the worst of us together. Where there was once Wayne “Bo” Hadley-Dickins, alcoholic miner with a very large temper and very little self control, there is now Wayne: Firebreather, Farmer, Survivor.
---
You are going to need perception,agility and luck.dont worry about maxing rifleman... crit savvy and better crits with stealth will do more dmg. An instigating with +50%vats crits will do mad dmg with a 3.5sneak attack. I have 10per/12agi/14luck and can sneak crit down a scorthbeast without breaking stealth. Vats crit/shoot/vats crit/shoot...so on and so on.
---
Nerf two shot! Nerf Explosive! (Wait what about melee?)

I was away for a week for training @ work, just getting back today. I have begun re-coding the landing page of http://centralfallout.com/ The landing page is almost complete and will likely be ready sometime today/early tomorrow. I have others coding a new nuclear code decryption software that works faster, and is completely automated for current weekly codes.
---
As soon as I am completed the landing page I am working on the actual "Plan Library" with information from the crowd sourcing, as well as what I can find on the web
---
Professional question: Do Brahmin poop twice as much as normal cows? If so, your business must certainly be booming
---
Lucky.
---
Try it, it’s super fun blowing shit up with MIRV grenades and lock-on missile launchers
---
I use slim, I mostly get blue screens when I fast travel to a near a nuke site or just randomly. It hasn’t happened in a while though, maybe two weeks ago. 
---
This would make sense if the game had a monthly fee.
---
But instead, it's a one-time up front cost.
---
From Bethesda's perspective, it doesn't matter if you actually play the game after that.  Atom shop aside, it's probably to their benefit if you buy the game and never play it - less resources for them to spend on server capacity.
---
My pc version got banned. Probably because I got into the dev room.
---
My xbox version is fine. While i dont duplicate i do use some exploits to put my camp inside marked locations. You could also use it to duplicate if you really wanted to but to me that would take the fun from the game if you had everything. 
---
No, because both. Two-shot literally doubles the bonus from explosive.
---
And so will everyone else, that's the even playing field I'm talking about, just read over my comments I'm sure you'll find it.
---
They did
---
Right, I love my mutants guass because it explosive and +p it's more special because it dropped for me.
---
I think the nerf is a must considering the new pvp mode coming though.
---
If anyone actually pays 14k, OP is taking them for a ride.
---
The unmodified damage seems weirdly high, unless I'm screwing up my math somehow.
---
Going by the damage reduction formula here:  http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance#Damage_Reduction_formula
---
Shooting the pistol with no damage reduction effects should do
---
15*( ( (15/79) * 0.15 )^0.365) = ~4.1 damage per shot
---
Actually, doing more math, all the damage seems higher than it should be given the known damage reduction formula (which has seemed to work correctly in other cases).
---
I wonder if you're getting bonus damage of some kind for shooting your target in the back?
---
Mmm.. well the game is already boring and broken so.
---
I have the Pro and no crashes for me. Where is the setting for that? I can check mine.
---
monongah?  I also can't seem to find this... is it towards Seneca Rocks? 
---
This is the reality right here. A fresh start in an ideal world is great. But in the real world you're going to have people who no-life the game for 20 hours a day every day from the moment the server goes live.
---
And those people are going to be miles ahead of everyone else, holding everyone else down by killing all other players on sight.
---
If I paid 95 US I better play and enjoy it too.  LOL, I do enjoy it.  Its just going to be a matter of time until  i give in and move on.  I have games I keep going back to.  Too early to say this will be one of the,.  Waiting to see how the patches "Nerf's"  fix the game.
---
He’s in the tree! He’s in the fucking tree!
---
Asking for a friend ?
---
Did they actually claim it or did you abandon it? I just learned the hard way the other day that if you claim a workshop it triggers PvP not just for the area around the workshop, but the entire map.  
---
Which platform are you two on?
---
I'm lvl 196... I'm always out there and,I dont.
---
Is that a console thing? How do you join onto another player unless that player is in your friends list?
---
Uuuggghhhh... I live in a metal box on a dried up lakebed. This looks like a five star hotel T\_T
---
Great build! :)
---
Did you read my non simplified comment? "I can tank the queen" should be enough to tell you my build isnt 1 hit and die. Also my gatling gun does over 1500 damage/shot and shoots quite fast (no adrenaline/buffs either). But guess what? That's not the point.
---
The point is that it takes gear, perks, *thought*, mutations to make a bloodied build. You know, investment. Its not just automatically good, you have to set it up to be good
---
So to start with, logging off to play a game? Do you see how stupid that sounds.  It is legitimately stupid to tell people "just log off to deal with people harassing you". Why should somebody have to log off to deal with a problem they were told they wouldn't have? 
---
Which brings us to your second point. It is not their fault for misunderstanding. Todd Howard LITERALLY said they wouldn't be forced into PvP and that destroying camps was to prevent griefing, not to instigate PvP. They didn't misunderstand anything. The information they were provided was misleading. Intentionally misleading?  I don't think so,  but misleading none the less. 
---
Well its a paint, I get it, its out of the dev room. But what about people who didn't know it was from the dev room and thought it was in the game, then they bought the elder paint plan from a trading reddit, it seems like a item that would be in the base game.
---
&gt; In all honestly this is not going to work it never has in the past.
---
Why would pve servers not work?  Nearly every mmo on the market has pve/pvp/rp servers.  It's the industry standard.
---
Right.  In melee, we have to put ourselves at risk to get in front of the enemy.  That often involves evading or tanking through fire.  It's not a question of if you'll Stimpack.  It's a question of when.
---
Ranged attackers can sit back and take pot shots while sipping a drink.
---
I'd say the risk-reward is fine.
---
depends. you could argue that WoW's stat squishes are game wide nerfs to players and npcs (though that largest normal nerf that comes to mind for me was a demolock spell(s?) was nerfed by 25%). devs need room to add in new weapons and stuff down the line and power creep is always and issue. granted an 80% nerf is huge but the TSE damage was way out of line to start with.
---
I'm not sure if this is serious or sarcasm/wisecrack.
---
Fallout 76 takes plaes 25ish years after the bombs fell. Fallout 4 takes place 200 years+/- after the bombs fell.
---
And that doesn't really hurt anyone but them
---
"a bit"
---
yea right, lmfao maybe on consoles, on pc they are still worth a bit, if hes going to sell that for 1.5k even at 3k it would not last 30 seconds.
---
yes, they ban people *after* they offend
---
You sound super pleasant to be around.
---
+1 and publish the actual PvP level / damage formula rather than us having to waste our fun time poking the system to develop guesstimates. 
---
Well, this is a pointless discussion anyway. Not sure why I was arguing so hard, it isnt gonna happen. The servers wont be that way.
---
I have a regular ps4 and very rarely get blue screened. I think Ive gotten the blue screen like 4x since I started playing which was about 3 weeks ago.
---
Just be cool and put half in a paper bag.
---
Depends what you consider a suggestion because they have definitely borrowed ideas from mods. The building mode in FO4 was an expanded version of Wasteland Defense from NV. The murder mystery vault from Far Harbor likely pulled inspiration from Autumn Leaves for NV. There was also a robot building mod I can't remember the name of that came before Automatron.
---
We abandoned it. We are on xbox
---
Pro, and since the patch I can not go to Whitesprings or Watoga. I’m not exaggerating, every single time I go there I blue screen. I’ve had over 60 in three days.  
---
On PC and since the last patch I'm non-stop CTD'ing and have lost 20+ FPS.. Getting frustrated.
---
Ok I thought I was seeing things. 
---
The TR is definitely putting out more damage than before. 
---
So what? They don't want ppl running around with shit no one can get unless they break the game. 
---
You said it all. Just bug fixes at this point. Once the bugs are gone, give us random variety to keep things interesting. Nothing should be guaranteed in the FO76 world.
---
I've got an old school, week one release PS4.  That fucker crashes to blue screen for me with regularity.  
---
Said at least, and take away slap damage and bounties that prevent you from defending yourself as you can get oneshotted before being allowed to fight back and I guarantee you'll see a change in the player base. There's no benefit and even a negative affect that comes from it. Reason being for a no restrictions server. What are you getting?
---
AH would have to be cross server
---
Junkie’s would be good if I could reliably get addicted to fucking anything. In fallout 4 each one added I think 10-15% more damage and you could stack a ton of them.
---
Addiction to anything seems much harder to obtain in 76 but maybe I’m not scarfing down enough chems 
---
Or a blowie.  You could accidentally get a *KA*-blowie.
---
I was starting to get them a couple of weeks before the patch. None since the patch. No disconnects (YET) either. Did freeze up on initial load this morning though.
---
To us It wasnt worth it. It was more the fact they followed us to our camp repeatedly killing us 
---
Broken for me, I prefer to play my games and explore my universes sequentially, prequels are overrated.
---
I did not.
---
I found a quad explosive radium rifle which has been tons of fun to use but is far from being OP.
---
I found an exterminators explosive shot gun which has cause my death more than any enemy I've faced in my 200 hours of play. I do the range of it needs to be nerfed but damage wise in close combat it has a high risk of killing yourself which balances it.
---
I lied.....I did somehow find  TSE minigun at a vendor 2 days ago for 561 caps. I bought nit even though I know it's probably a dupe. Yes it does a lot of damage....and the 2 should not be paired together but it's ridiculous to Nerf explosive and TS weapons across the board.
---
At the end of the day I have 2 guns that are not OP that are going to be nerfed. These are the guns I've spent the last 2 weeks spec'ing my character to. I spent all of my caps and a week of gameplay jumping across the map looking for vendors selling radium mods or rifles that I could buy to break down.
---
I'm not a duper.....I don't farm Whitesprings 24 hours a day......I was enjoying wandering the wasteland and building my character based on what I found. My game play has just been reset and I'm f'ing pissed!
---
Right, but the journey has now dropped from 1st class to sitting in filth beside the coal fired furnaces. It's twice as long and you have to pay double.
---
Jesus, thanks for the information
---
The crafting room with a stash is in the resort, not in the bunker, which means you have to go through a loading screen to get to it, and then another loading screen to get back into the bunker though.
---
There's a ton of crafting tables and vendor screens all throughout the bunker, but there's no stash box in the bunker itself.
---
PSN Luffy103
---
Yeah, I know. That's not broken chronology. That's just telling your stories in a non-chronological order. Different things. 
---
Whaaaaaaaat?!?
---
With the explosive perk it still adds 120% damage, which is considerable. In PvP you are going to have to make choices with your build. Do I run fireproof and not adamantium skeleton (melee player)? Do I run both and cut points from somewhere else? It makes the game more cerebral. Or people quit because they lack a average IQ and now can’t fuck everything in 1 hit. Not directed at you, just pointing out the obvious after reading some of the hilarious reactions here
---
Well, with the greatest respect I think we can call you a special case. Damn that's an old PS4 lol. I think you may buck the trend lol.
---
How hard is to hop ?
---
&gt;Also, when your gauss weapon stops firing even though you charged it up.
---
This guy gets it
---
Yeah, but the resort isn't the bunker, they're connected, but 2 different cells.
---
It's a pointless discussion because other than "goddmode people wont want to play it" there's no reason not to 
---
It's ok. Im over it. The servers wont be this way so thats what matters 
---
What lv 
---
This wasn’t a question of whether or not they had the technology. It’s literally a design choice.
---
True. True. I misread it. Yeah, I forgot. It seems like a ridiculous oversight.
---
Lucky Ted (maxed out luck): Ted was a guy who throughout his entire life was just stupid lucky. Ted studied like every other good person out there and maintained his body by working out. Ted was stonger than most guys but almost anyone can out run him (skipped leg day). Ted didn't sign up for Vault-Tec nor was he chosen to live in a vault. On the day the bombs dropped Ted was mistaken for someone and dragged to the vault against his will. Now Ted finds himself in rather odd situations stumbling across the Fallout universe. What awaits Ted is a mystery however this man has impeccable luck and always seems get out of situations in nick of time.
---
No it's not. Two shot is far too powerful of an upgrade, it creates a huge leap in damage that not even 9 perk points combined can even rival. That's way over budget, even after the Nerf it's probably still best to have TSE.
---
My stored camp budget is at 120%, I have no stored structures and nothing built.
---
Everyone I've talked to that has the same problem also has a tamed creature in their camp so that seems like the likely cause
---
Everytime I move my camp my stored budget keeps rising by 10%
---
Playing on PC
---
Nah, the journey has changed from flying to taking the train, you can enjoy the view out the window now..
---
On Xbox, they have a Looking For Group section on the console. If you go to the Fallout 76 one, people sell TSE for 500 caps. 
---
Im lvl 62
---
Zilla - Basically Mad Max. Wander around alone in search of nothing in particular, occasionally helping out people in need only to vanish over the horizon just as suddenly as I showed up. 
---
A proper tse buils needs the 9 cards for weapon base, 5 for explosive damage, 3 for radius, addreline, and nerd rage so thats 8 more.  So thats 25 cards out of 50 just for the damage more for accuracy or spread or armor pen.
---
You obviously have no idea who to build characters. And drugs,nukas, food effect any build.
---
I still want to see things that drive player interaction, even pvp interactions.
---
For example: Powering up the power plants, great for society right? Maybe not, nuclear waste is terrible for the environment so maybe the powerplant being up and running **increases** the amount of ghoul or mutated wildlife spawns in the area. There could be rewards associated with powering the plant up, as well as rewards associated with preventing them from being powered up.
---
Similarly with the silos.  The Enclave wants us to launch nukes. I don't think the brotherhood or free states ever wanted that. There could be rewards for entering silos and repairing defensive systems which will make the silo much harder to launch a nuke from.
---
I mean, it's very low compared to other games with auction houses, low enough that by the end of the game you have probably picked up every weapon type multiple times. 
---
That's why i feel like they'd go with vendors at CAMPs.  Maybe initially with limited discover - maybe an icon on the map.  Later maybe expand discover like SWG did by adding a system to locate camps with an item you want.
---
Your hyped for loot boxes?
---
I was invited to discussion group on another site and the focus mainly appears to be about duping.  Mostly Xbox users.  I don't see a single person mentioning a ban and it is a big group.  There was gathering of parties do the duping method that still works and they are doing it after the patch (like yesterday) via the vendor disconnect method.   If it is as widespread of ban that you are reporting it pretty amazing that it has not made it to the forum (other than that one post) nor to youtube.  How are you finding out about the 40 of 200 friends being banned?  If I was banned I don't think I would go the trouble to send messages telling 200 random people what happened.  That part just seems extremely odd to me.  If you want to send a message to send a message to a huge group of people on PS4 what is the process?
---
Settings &gt; Sound and Screen &gt; Video Output Settings &gt; Supersampling Mode
---
Over it? It's not that deep, we're discussing future content for a game lmao
---
We shouldn't have to, like if you dont have anything positive to contribute, dont 
---
well, yes, obviously.
---
I'm asking if the people who had been duping and whatnot are banned, or if it's only the people who do that stuff now that they've announced that they're trying to do something about it.
---
I didn't even find it that hard the first time around. Mildly annoying with the radios and speakers but those weren't exactly difficult to deal with.
---
Yeah do mayor for a day you get all rise. It will be max lv and it will have close to what you are looking for.
---
Because I accidentally re-created my Fallout 4 character when starting Fallout 76, I decided that they were actually a pair of sisters who grew up in a poor mining in the Ash Heap region. The elder sister Beth was extremely intelligent but a bit too  much of a dreamer, and when she received a scholarship to study engineering at C.I.T. up in the Commonwealth she jumped at the chance.
---
The younger girl Martha was just as intelligent, but grew up much more pragmatic and dour. While her sister’s head was filled with thoughts of robots and computer, Pipboy games and comics, she had to deal with the gloomy and uncertain future promised by the automation of the region. She was accepted as one of Vault 76’s “young and gifted” residents just before the Great War.
---
The rest is history.
---
Yeah exactly.
---
I had a room above some medium generators.  Got the Fusion generator plan and tried to replace them.
---
Had to tear down everything above the generators and then I saw the stupid connector poking through...
---
I was able to shift everything to make it work, but what a pain in the keister (pardon my French).
---
And excavator mods are unmarked at vendors. So it won't say something like T-51b calibrated  shocks, it will only say calibrated shocks
---
I don't see why it is frowned upon. The only post I have seen about it is people complaining about the bases set up to kill ghouls with turrets through windows. I dont have turrets on my base I leave it open so people farming that area have access to a stash box and work benches as needed. Perhaps you care to shed some light as to why it is frowned upon. I will stand my ground either way, People who want to put bounties on themselves by destroying my base are more than welcome too, Just don't complain when I come to collect the price on your head.
---
I am so disappointed by that announcement. My standard gun is a 2-shot combat rifle that just doesn't do a whole lot of damage but it is the best I have. It sucks that I face that being nerfed.
---
It's not a prequel anyway. That would require the use of the same characters. Or at least different characters but the story needs to tie together somehow (usually with referenced events and such) Fallout 3 is a prequel to Fallout 4. New Vegas is not a prequel to Fallout 4. 
---
Buff to the 10mm SMG too
---
Not sure if you have heard, but they are nerfing TSE. You're welcome for the heads up. 
---
Incorrect? Two shot is 100% more damage, compared to Hunters that only gives 30% and only works on animals. So it’s correct. 
---
It is not the same in every video game. Know what is? Developers balancing their games.
---
I’ve replied to the strongest points you mentioned, as a show of good faith. On that, you’re on shaky ground.
---
Speaking of weapon damage numbers, I have 2 identical Gauntlet items in the same condition, one I carry one I have in Stash (2 of them because weird shit happens and oops it gets lost/broken) so anyways while doing inventory, the one I carry says 168 Dmg and the other one in Stash says 184 then all of a sudden the 184 re-rolls itself to 169 so, w t f?
---
How can anything be credible with numbers if stuff just poof changes, which one is correct, Stash or Carry?
---
Given the queen's scaling durability based on players present, I would be more impressed if you said you had a LARGE group of players that killed the queen without TSE. I think they may want to revisit the queen's rate of scaling since they're (happily) nerfing TSE.
---
What article?
---
Can I see your tree camp?
---
There's a whole duping discord I guess where they all speak freely about their crimes and also update on bans lol. Some guy on xbox got banned at a random time for his 8million inventory size... They're not all gone but they're doing good so far getting rid of them.
---
That's why I said maby doing it a secondary mission, once you do it, you have free fast travel through the stations.
---
Yeah but what I mean is I know the servers wont be this way so why waste time discussing it.
---
I have already done it when i was lvl 40 so that weapon dmg isn't 200
---
That's strange - i've never had the fusion core generator higher than 1 floor or even touching the ceiling
---
Somebody nuked Whitesprings the other day and pulled the radius east to cover the train station. I picked up 71 cobalt with green thumb equipped by ignoring the clubhouse and taking a long walk.
---
Go to the challenges section in the menu in game. There's one that keeps track of hours played. 
---
Ok let me look at what I have and I will get back with you.
---
The monster mash event is a ghost town.
---
The answer is obvious.....make PvP players bullet sponges like super mutants. That way you don't have to ruin my game experience to accommodate a small minority if PvP players.
---
Does the connector poke through the roof/floor above it?
---
Or does is not let you place a roof floor because the top of it is Too Damn High?
---
No kink shaming
---
Dont tempt me with a good time...
---
That’s Bethesda’s concern. It would be in their interests to do that though.
---
I have a regular my bf has the pro. He does bluescreen more. 
---
It is progress toward the 7600 hours played atom goal
---
Yeah he clearly hasn't tried them himself if he thinks my TS Gatling's second shot (and this is after ADSing) being questionably less accurate than a pellet from my Pump with skeet shooter is less of a problem than my TS Handmade only being moderately accurate at mid range.
---
Noice!  Let me know if you toss the handmade !
---
Lol dont talk about DE here, people wouldnt be able to handle their cash shop, even though you dont technically need to buy anything with money. 
---
It's not that ridiculous.
---
You can just stand still and drink purified water to outheal whatever slap-damage is hitting you (unless you're a very low level).
---
Should they rework the pvp-system? Hell fucking yeah. Is this a hardcore-grief pvp game? Fuck no. I love fallout, but i've played plenty of hardcore online survival games to know what it's like to lose everything you farmed for. It kinda expected the pvp-drama since this used to be a singleplayer series.
---
Me and the people i've played with never had any issues regarding this topic, thus making it hard for me to believe that this really is an issue that should be their top priority tot be resolved. 
---
Ok. Show me proof. If this is even remotely common it should be a simple task to find a video confirming it. 
---
But the patch recently is making me dc more often.. 
---
You’re excited to spend more money on things that should just be in the game to begin with? 
---
Can you drop some citations at the bottom of your reply? I'm looking to compile as much info as possible to try and figure it out... in the name of science.
---
Whitesprings is disqualified as the toilet paper rolls in the golf club are installed incorrectly.

Hi! I had this happen when trying to create a mod for my armor, and I needed gold. It said gold 7/7, so I should have enough, right? 
---
It was bugged, because I had 3 in my inventory, and 4 gold in my stash. I went into my stash, took the gold into my inventory, and then I could build the mod just fine.
---
I just think it sometimes bugs out when you have just about enough, and the resources are kept in separate places. This might be connected to junk having different weight in your inventory versus your stash because of perk cards, but I don't know. 
---
20%, just a 1/5 of what it is now.
---
The Veil of Mysteries protects against airborne damage and disease and has no -2 to PER. The helmet isn't pay to win.
---
But there is literally an assaulton message parlor in the game. 
---
right but the clear face mask still obstructs your vision, the reason the veil doesnt it because it doesnt cover your eyes... 
---
yep, this.  Really surprised it wasn't in the last patch let alone the next! 
---
Btw. Are there even recipes/blueprints to craft wood armor? I never encountered one of them.
---
3 star?
---
On PC, the app just crashes and drops you to the desktop.
---
Kinda.
---
I got the Core Assembly plans from Grafton.
---
Got kill 1001 robots the other day
---
You're missing the point. You can easily avoid any pvp in this game. 
---
Then don’t play it? There is a whole server dedicated to PvE.
---
This is my first fallout. I’ve been playing CoD for a long time and love PvP. The player base that enjoys PvP FAR outnumbers those who don’t. Video games by nature are competitive 
---
I figured it's because all of the gas masks are dirty and the grit prevents people from seeing clearly. All that dust and all
---
But Kink-Shaming's my Kink!

Trevor “Vault-Boy” Hadley-Dickins. Elder brother of the Hadley-Dickins family. Pre war spent time researching the upcoming vaults, before starting a career in their construction, earning the somewhat derogatory nickname from his younger brother Bo. Being a construction manager for the local vault came with its benifits, like guaranteed entrance. Unfortunately, his family was not entirely composed of Vault-Tec Construction Managers. You may follow the obvious conclusion. 
---
After the war, the world was not at all how Vault Tec has promised. They said it would be bad, but manageable. “Like camping but in town” he had heard from a fellow employee. This was not camping. This was not living. This was dying, very, very slowly. The wastes disgust him. Everywhere he goes he’s consumed by his hate for the ashes of his once beautiful home. It only gets worse the further from the vaults... perhaps vault tec was right. Maybe the world will be saved, but only with Vault Tec. The world is greener near the vault. When rapture came, only vault Tec could save us. Only Vault Tec cares. 
---
Only Vault Tec Cares.
---
Praise Be to the Overseer.
---
Pvp isn't even a thought for me anymore. I got one shot clean out of pacifist at a vendor the other day. You can vats teleport in melee. They have so much balancing to do. I feel bad for Bethesda. Lol. 
---
&gt; I have a Quad Combat Shotgun that's 32 round magazine
---
Be still, my heart.
---
The excel document should be self updating from the form responses, periodically I have been going through it deleting troll responses however my current priority is getting http://centralfallout.com/ running. On the website will be the official "Plan Library" from the data I have sourced as well as online data
---
Pro owner.  No bluescreens.  Just the normal disconnected from server now and then.
---
Also because have you seen their forums?. Terrible setup lol.
---
This reddit sub is soooo much better to chat about the game and give feedback. Plus the mods here are very good lads who put in alot of work to keep it looking nice. :)
---
In all honesty Vault 76 is a really shitty idea, as all the endgame players would easily manage to fuck the game up for the newbies. IMO Whitespring would be pretty perfect, but not some dumb 1200 account stash. Like wtf lmfao 
---
Then PvP was still on and Pacifist wouldn’t have helped.  I just learned this the other night and I’m level 90-something.  Pacifist limits your damage to others as trivial or “slap” damage and vice versa. This is handy in a firefight with other team members.  It only applies when you aren’t engaged in PvP.  When you claim a workshop, you trigger PvP.
---
So, technically they weren’t griefers, but anyone with that high of a level should have shown some restraint towards you both.  
---
I’m also on Xbox.  Send me an invite (GT: Joe Important), I have a bunch of plans I can give you guys and I like to hand out free weapons.😀
---
I wish my wife would play Fallout, but she plays some Disney Park builder game on her phone...which...in my opinion, is exactly the same as Fallout except the gratuitous violence.
---
Yup, some rifle related perks weren't recogizing the Tesla Rifle as a rifle. They didn't say which perks, but seems like Tank Killer or Tenderizer. 
---
&lt;3
---
Hey Joe! Sorry about that, me and my friend were bored lol
---
And they shouldn't have to stop killing you, what is your positive contribution ? Whining about legit PvP ?
---
What's your source? I dont need a source to know that they aren't going to introduce new servers in a way that would alienate more than half of their playerbase.
---
The CAMP power generator.  No fusion cores.
---
The assassin gear is all I keep in my stash box now. Before level 50 I had armor sets like zealots for scorched, trouble shooter for robots etc. After the recent out break of dupers and Griefers I have since then trashed all the extra armors and replaced them with assassin sets modded for different situations. (I.E) Padded for explosives, lead lined for energy etc. 
---
**Notes to Consider**
---
I normally dont engage in pvp as I am the guy who tries to help players more than anything. But some people set out to be assholes whether it is just because they are bored where they have cheated and duped their self out of enjoyable content to play or they are youtubers trying to make "toxic kid videos". When I am pushed or I see people pushing players to make them snap, I can be a asshole. 😂
---
Ok
---
Ok side question based on another comment. Do you have supersampling on?
---
100k Nuka grapes? He may not have duped on *that character*, but he was involved in duping. 
---
It's fun to use in strangers houses.  Especially in their bed.
---
 *gruff redneck voice
---
 "Hey there big boy"
---
Lmao the thing is with the Warframe shop. Its completely fair and you can earn everything in the shop in the game or through playing the game &amp; not to mention the game is 100% free. Start to finish. 
---
&gt; literally taking away 75% of the damage output
---
Literally? Ok show me the math. How are two shots losing 75% of their damage?
---
I run my rifle build the same way, always looking for a way to make him more tanky without pa. My issue came down to you said “you just equip TSE with explosive and done” that’s not the case. Some people work their builds out. I have 3 characters with 3 types of builds and I’m constantly changing them. I run low hp on all of my characters as well. So I can state that if they nerf bloodied and explosive I’m taking a hit on both sides. But I shouldn’t feel as if I have to play my melee build because my explosive rifle is about to get nerfed. The gun itself isn’t the issue. The issue is the assholes who run 1k+ bobble heads and can kill you even if you’re not wanting to pvp. TSE isn’t good unless you setup for it. The normal high end damage of a TSE without knowing a good setup is 300-400 damage. And that’s on the high end. High end of a bloodied melee weapon at low hp without any knowledge, just points in melee damage bonus cards is 1200+ damage. How does that weight fair? Not to mention all you have to do is pop on some pa in melee build and non spec’d you aren’t taking high amounts of damage. What they should’ve done was fixed bobbles first. Then established if the TSE was that bad, then nerfed accordingly. If you think the TSE community isn’t going to go ape shit when this comes out then you’re crazy. They will have to nerf melee builds the same at some point. I put a lot of time into my builds and I’m always moving cards around and changing perks to go toward what I want my end game to be. I have almost 400 hours of play time doing this. So to categorize all TSE players into a category of “they just use TSE and kill” is ignorant. I spend the same time working on my TSE build as I do my melee. 
---
What if they did this but in another vault. make a new vault for a player hub.
---
Or make legendary effects only active in blast zones.
---
Yeah, it pokes into the floor above.  Won't let me place it.  Apparently I might have had better luck if I'd placed the generator first, and then built the floor later, but this was a retrofit.
---
I have stopped doing nuke events.  Every time I have tried since the last patch, I CTD about once every 15 minutes.  Running around everywhere else I CTD about once a night.  I even tried dropping my video settings to lower res and low settings to see it it was a rendering issue and still CTD in the nuke zones.
---
I had this happen to me too, twice, but only after a nuke had recently been launched at the prime fissure. It seems like the server is having a hard time loading loot all over the map, when a nuke is launched. 
---
I have also experienced people being able to empty the containers for me, as in I will look at the contents of the container, some player will move up to it, and I can literally see it disappear. I thought the loot was supposed to be individual? Someone connect me if I'm wrong please. 
---
It's been happening to me recently too.
---
The only thing I find worse than this is the constant 'Server connection issue, controls disables' message.  This is especially bad when fighting a group of Super Mutants, because they don't freeze and stop attacking you.
---
this would be awesome.
---
Mine is hooked up to a 4K TV - it just tells me that the option is there if I switch back to a full HD TV.
---
Negative.
---
Weapon damage depends on your build, mutations and items(weapon, chems).
---
For example, I have an alt melee build with all two hand perks can deal 390 with all rise.
---
The third low HP character can deal 990 unarmed damage with random weapon.
---
When she has full health, 190 with all rise I think
---
Last Call!
---
That's a healthy addiction  you've got sir. May i  suggest some friends and family visits? Perhaps a breath of fresh air? 
---
For real though. You need to put it down homie. 
---
That doesnt work with workshops, as it stands you can literally force someone into pvp against their will if they own a workshop. Even if they are on the other side of the map
---
I have had that kind of since the update. I can't move but can still access my map and exit. It's weird. Even after a minute I still can't move.
---
I agree, making the game easier for fragile humans is not going to make the game better.
---
Guys let’s not forget about weapon durability. I would hate to see a change in the two shot. So all my TS weapons would spend 2x more bullets (meaning 2x resource farm for bullets) AND 2x more durability problems meaning 2x more materials to farm for fixing. The funny part is that u cannot even farm resources together, it’s ineffective. Is the game supposed to be a solo resource grind main focus ?  
---
You can only buy one at a time? I could’ve sworn I’ve seen him have up to 3 of the Grape and Orange variants.
---
Yep....greed is a bitch lol
---
Most of the reports right now seem to be coming from XB1 for the dupers, for the dev room it was only accessible on PC.
---
I think they probably ran their algorithm to detect dupers on XB1 first, will assess any false positives and tweak it before rolling it out further. Either that or XB1 players are a lot more vocal about being banned than PC and PS4.
---
Can't say they will catch them all, but it does seem they are trying and have been watching for a while.
---
Nice! 😄
---
Only other thing I experienced similar to this is when there is some kind of a disconnect between the stash and the workstation. Workstation doesn't see materials in the stash properly. Open the stash, so the game recounts your junk. Hope it helps.
---
This is good info that I always forget to convey in these threads.
---
Source for what? that I'd enjoy a server like that? Just personal preference, I never implied its definitely happening, simply said it sound like a good idea and gave my reasons for why I think it'd work.
---
But anyways, so you don't have anything? Cool.
---
pappododo 
---
Mini nuke it. You know you want to. This is the equivalent of a noisy douchebag selfish neighbor, only unlike in real life, you can nuke them! And the consequences are much cheaper!
---
Yeah ever since they were nerfed there has been a massive decline in people using them
---
How is that not over budget?
---
Thanks! I sent an invite :)
---
This is not explaining pacifist mode very well. Pacifist mode does not make you receive less damage from other players, the only thing pacifist mode does is make you unable to deal damage to other players so you don't start pvp acidentaly.
---
full ultracite armor with a single quest reward that normal ?
---
It’s not my fault your deathclaw was dressed so provocatively
---
You can get a ass pounding from fisto in FO: NV
---
Probably a really high level
---
I'm at level 87 and still building perks for special situations, crafting, Team Play etc..
---
I don't think I will be done till around 100-110
---
At the very least it needs to be treated as a crime as in previous games.
---
Did you find this laying around or was it a quest reward? This is what you get for finishing the BoS questline
---
It isn't, there are a few receiver plans I've only learned from plans. A lot of hunting rifle learned from plans
---
I do... The logic of marketing. They wpukdnt make as much money if they did it that way because they would alienate more then half of their players. If you cabt see that its not my problem.
---
If they move it stops working. Getting a limb crippled forces moving.
---
So what I wonder now is, can Adamantium Skeleton still prevent the effects that just cause crippling like Tormentor? Cause if not, there is a hilarious way to kill people who stack that.
---
Hey, if you don't want your two-shot lever action rifle, I'll take it. 
---
And theres a black titanium deposit that you can place your camp on with an extractor up on the hill SW of the Charleston Landfill and W of the tower.
---
It's not a bug, they nerfed the fusion core drop rate and fixed the recharging bug.
---
The drainage is faster than fallout 4, but ppl ignore it due to the previous bug.
---
I am expecting it to come pretty soon once people start calling it out more since it will be the new FotM
---
I'm 90 with barely room for one turret. 
---
Shut your filthy mouth 
---
Nope, but for some reason I keep firing it up every day. Could do with some sort of horde mode imo.
---
Melee armor pen is nutty. I think it should be higher than gun armor piercing just for balance reasons, since melee players have to put themselves in a lot more danger.
---
A lot of the melee power is just cause they’re the favorite tool of people who use stacked buff builds. You could actually make any gun OP with those.
---
Haven’t seen it either, i think people on this sub just talk outta their ass
---
Only when the server is getting unstable.
---
I find this to be a good recommendation. I would agree with this completely. 
---
Where did you get the mod? I'm trying to find it for mine
---
Ive only done SBQ once, but I didnt like it because it taxed the server so much that you couldnt loot ANYTHING from any of the bodies. You would hover over a body after you killed it and it would just say "loading" and never change from that. I cleared out my inventory anticipating getting a shit ton of cool stuff and got nothing for my efforts. If I see someone nuking her next time, I'll pass and then go to collect some flora afterwards
---
I guess I don't follow.  You said fusion generator.  I should have said "fusion generator".  The connector doesn't stick through the roof.  There's a bug where it'll jump to the floor above if you have a roof/floor above it.  You just have to remove that before putting it down.
---
There's clearance between the connector on the floor/roof above it.  It's just a bug.  It used to happen with PA benches also but they fixed that.  It still happens with plants also.
---
If you can't remove the floor above you can add temporary stairs to help remove it.
---
Wife here. Thank you so much for the great info.
---
I have, and agree with you. 
---
When I’m looking for raiding activities I always check workshops.
---
Something I have noticed is you need to check them a few times because if a player is in a loading screen the workshop can show as unowned on the map even if it is claimed
---
It works outside of VATS
---
No big deal, at the end of the day it’s just junk and the Wasteland is full of it. 😀
---
exactly what I was thinking
---
People don't go nuts and spend all day ranting, making and watching YouTube videos over burnt toast.  They eat it, or they don't, and they move on with their lives.
---
Probably new content in the future, like Vaults and Whitesprings houses...
---
"you can't use your OP build on the pvp server" 
---
"WERE BEING ALIENATED WTF BETHESDA"
---
I had one of those. I killed myself with backsplash damage every time I tried to use it.  I gave it away.
---
I would love the SULPHER water sink that cures diseases like the one found at the Whitesprings Resort gazebo near the tennis courts and the ghoul legendary/xp-farm smush room.
---
Possibly used the dupe for their budget. I destroy these bases on site. 
---
Probably gonna have to wait for a mod like in fallout 4. I can’t remember the name but I had a mod that allowed me to place items and make them static
---
Love it. The 1st character I made (but subsequently erased) in 76 was Nate's brother. 
---
They are abusing the glitch that would duplicate items not placed on foundations when you move
---
You either commented on the wrong person or you are completely impervious to sarcasm.  Either way, kudos. 
---
jeez. if i get a bounty by accident, i'm usually thankful when someone comes and pops me.
---
I've been wanting this! make it happen Bethesda
---
Yes it does because you’re not capable of initiating PvP when passive mode is on. Prove it. 
---
Those are pretty cool ideas.
---
Well the whole game is a bug infested mess so I believe you. Unfortunately. Unless you were both standing still then you just had better gear and build. 
---
I'm not for nerfing anything btw..  I think they should have just nerfed boblehead stacking before nerfing both parts OF TSE.
---
I'm definitely against the calling for melee to be nerfed though.
---
Who says its OP? Also yes, taking away peoples' 400-1000 hours of work is alienating. Weak arguement pal.
---
Servers have been trash the last 24 hours.
---
if only there were some kind of Nuka Cola... *plant.* if they had something like that they could possibly do this.
---
*if only there were some way*
---
At least since the latest update, I've always seen one of each Nuka variant that's specific to the Whitespring.
---
Oh didn’t know this, I’ll check it out - thanks!
---
&gt; 2: Simply update pacifist mode to where if you activate pacifist mode you can NOT turn it off again for 24 hours. And while a player is in pacifist mode they can NOT attack players NOR can they be attacked and killed.
---
No.  
---
Sometimes a player pops up with a high wanted bounty because they're mowing down fresh vault meat and I need to turn off pacify to deal with them. And then turn it back on so I don't get a wanted status on myself accidentally. It's in no way my fault that I'm switching pacifist off/on.
---
No problem, I generally play after 8 est.  
---
Hmm... my twoshot leveraction has higher base than my twoshotgauss according to my pipboy stats. 
---
or leave Vault 76 alone but eventually allow Vault 63 to be opened?  With NPC's!!
---
I had one of those structures save my life back when I was low level. I was trying to snipe a level 60+ glowing one but I might as well have been throwing rocks. This was the first glowing one I had seen in the game and I had no idea that they were lightning fast. He chased me down the road until I happened upon a camp that looked much like the one pictured above. 
---
You forget the 5lbs of glue and duct tape that keeps both together.
---
I would love something like this but imagine the headaches Bethesda would get when people start complaining about the lore!
---
I feel you. SBQ keeps giving me lead pipes.
---
OC Decorator.
---
I'm thinking we probably won't see mods like that until we get private servers,  if we even get them.  :(
---
OG Launch day PS4 here. From Beta through Christmas I had very little trouble with blue screens or disconnects. For some reason though the two weeks leading up to this patch, I probably had ~20-30 blue screens. It was getting bad. Since patch, zero blue screens, zero disconnects, one initial load in freeze this morning. Other than that it's been much smoother sailing since this patch released. Sorry to hear some others are not having the same luck.
---
Did you do a PvP?
---
It's the quest reward from the bos quest "Belly of the beast".
---
Yeah didn’t they have a fatal incident with a guest. 
---
Ps4 pro blue screen often. Super sampling on/off makes no difference
---
I have a legendary gatling gun with faster firing speed. I upgraded to the speedy receiver. If I had that thing shoot any faster, it...it would shred...so much.
---
If you're a sniper you can go the instigating route. You're averagr hunting rifle, LAR, OR Gauss rifle still kick ass. Then add whatever seckndary legendary like exploding, and you're good to go for everything but the queen. 
---
I agree i feel so sorry for dev who spent hours upon hours creating vault 76 and it get at most 10 mins of enjoyment before you rush out of the vault to explore. What an amazing idea to utilise the space as a player hub.. maybe have some games in there to play like snooker and basket ball, after all we can already build these at our camps but are cosmetic only. And a trading area for players to gather and trade &amp; hangout for ages. 
---
Go to the fallout76 marketplace subreddit, you will get more takers.
---
539 hours here (yikes) with multiple characters. I agree with pretty much everything in your comment, but I would argue bloodied isnt the problem at all. The problem is the way melee damage scales with STR and the fact that you can stack melee buffs without cheating (all melee damage food buffs stack unlike any other food buffs, never mind that melee can also stack bobbleheads/magazines). 
---
Or you could say the problem is that all our damage buffs are multipliers which get way out of hand when stacked in large amounts. Bloodied? Not that strong on it's own, but as soon as you add in adrenal reaction it goes through the roof. Then bloody mess, nerd rage both stack very well, etc. Its not really any 1 thing that is broken, what is broken is how they all stack/multiply/interact with each other IMO
---
I'm not running a shotgun right now (gathering 1k+ ammo until I start using it), but I remember it's 8 stock, but for rest didn't remember so I took it from here:
---
[http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Combat\_shotgun\_(Fallout\_76)](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Combat_shotgun_(Fallout_76))  
---
So either you are wrong or the wiki =)
---
There is definitely a chance that this will happen. Hopefully server stability will continue to improve and the games playability becomes more consistent. If you are on XBX1, and would like another shot at SBQ, let me know. The violet flux is worth picking if you get the opportunity. Have a good day. 
---
you are angel man, fuck that dude! 
---
&gt; A prequel is a literary, dramatic, or cinematic work whose story precedes that of a previous work, by focusing on events that occur before the original narrative
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel
---
Time moves  in one  direction. Embrace  it.
---
I've been testing this..I have a full set . What platform are you on ?
---
This is how I do it as well. Sucks when you want to move them a little, have to pull the roof down and replace everything that was on it.
---
Dude if you can still load it on a normal server you've literally lost nothing and wouldn't be required to play the new mode, so nobody is even losing a single minute of work like please explain the problem because that's a "weak argument pal" lmfao
---
Did they? Ha! I havnt combed through those terminals but it seems about right in the fucked up pre-war world. 
---
They could do a faction system like in fo4, they could tie pvp to it so that you cant really shoot people from your own faction. 
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/1pB3jkcq5unlYTB3TTURrZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-17-2019
---
I just saw it it's confirmed, iether way with demo expert it's still 40% weapon dmg over a few country miles so still not bad
---
No and I assume it won’t end well
---
I agree that it should be higher than for regular guns, but 75% compared to 36% for rifles for example? Thats twice as much in the perks and just too much
---
I think its only dangerous when playing without PA
---
Watoga is where I had my initial load in freeze this morning. After trying twice, I had to give it a bit more time to load in before I could run about. Never happened before though.
---
You just made a paradox
---
Too bad it's not a bad ass arc of explosions...
---
This community confuses me. This is more interesting content than whining to Bethesda, yet it has still been downvoted.
---
Two shot is not double damage, its an additional projectile. No one said it was only my weapons. If there is an issue with the two affixes they should not put them together. Nerfing 2 shot  fixes nothing. Its not the reason people are getting one shotted, and it will still happen after the update. 
---
Ahhh not 4k here
---
&gt; Why should somebody have to log off to deal with a problem they were told they wouldn't have?
---
They were never told they would not have a problem with this. They were explicitly told the deterrent for griefing was OTHER PLAYERS dealing with it, not the game itself.
---
&gt;logging off to play a game
---
That's the good thing about multiple servers.
---
&gt;Todd Howard LITERALLY said they wouldn't be forced into PvP
---
Yes, you don't have to engage in PvP YOURSELF. But he is quite clear that other people can still slap you about.
---
I'd agree if you could set choice payments. For example, I want to sell a 1-star weapon. I'd set it to 500 caps. Or I'd have an optional payment of 100x 5.56mm ammo.
---
Caps should still be a compulsory payment type though.
---
Ha..totally meant to post that there.  My mistake.
---
Not yet but big update coming at the end of the month so fingers crossed 
---
People are not going to want to do an extra 400-1000 hours extra just catch up to were they already were. Get real.
---
Breakin the laws of thermodynamics erryday
---
The problem with no level scaling though is that new characters get shit on as soon high level players pass though an area and don't kill anything. Just following the main quest line, I run into level level 60+ scorched and ghouls, 40+ mole men, etc as a level 20. I'm burning resources faster than I can gather them in a lot of cases.
---
I mean they've gotta have something to add to the game 6 months from now to keep us playing.
---
I notice they didn't nerf melee.  Watched a guy one shot crit the queen with all rise.  Working as intended.  Ranged being able to keep up....nerf hammer it!!!!
---
Doing it this way would only serve to protect new players and players who habe no interest in doing pvp. By being able to turn on pacifist that does not allow other players to kill them. The 24 hour time limit would only serve to prevent people from trying to troll others by turning it off and on every other minute. Until bethesda fixes pacifist mode to where players under its effect are protected and can not be killed it is broken and useless to those who dont wish to pvp and griefers will continue to seek players like this.
---
I like all these suggestions and heartily co-sign! 
---
One additional thing I'd like from a technical side - I'd like if all of the events I've completed were properly displayed in my Pip-Boy under Quests, and also if there was some sort of indication on the map. Like, I've done "Feed the People" and "Fertile Soil" about a dozen times just because I'll be in the area and they're easy, but I know I've done other events and only some of them show up in my quest log as being done. It would also be nice if, when I put my cursor on them on the map, it said (REPEAT) or (R) or (REPLAY) or something to that effect. If there are 5 events going on at the same time, I'd rather tackle the one I haven't tried yet. 
---
I played amounts of Diablo 2 back i the day. Yes, please.
---
I know this is WAY out there, but what if they put in speech recognition so that was people say in voice chat would also be in chat log?
---
Explosive isn’t nerfed in the ground bro. Those guns will still get the job done. With the explosive perk you are still doing 120% extra damage! Plus other damage increasing perks.
---
The Radium Rifle is excellent in PvP. You are doing 3 different types of damage with a 80 round mag. If you need help with your build or are on XB1 I can help you maximize your gun too. I have several (not all) mods for the Radium.
---
I bought a TSE too. I think almost everyone did, just to keep up, but I’m glad they are getting nerfed and will probably just destroy mine 
---
You know what im done with your snarky replies. You obviously don't have a good grasp on the games mechanics or other pvp games. Thanks have a good day. 
---
Assume the position.
---
I’m surprised that challenge isn’t worth more than 40 Atoms. 
---
Good story, and glad you were able to repeatedly smash him. Some people are just like that unfortunately. It's a sad existence, but I guess we can't force them to be better people. If you haven't heard it from the people you've helped along the way, then thanks from the rest of us for being generous.
---
Dude really?
---
Except that you're still loaded into the world durong the end of the load screen. I've died multiple times from an enemy attacking me as soon as the load screen finishes. It's not a huge deal since dying means nothing,  but it is quite inconvinient. 
---
Alright twisted muscles does boost melee damage but it also ravage your ranged damage. But you can take solace in the fact that talons only effects fist weapons and fist weapons can’t be used in Power Armor, so fist users will need to sacrifice all there defence and use a hazmat suit in order to beat things into a bloody pulp in a nuke zone. 
---
But are they losing anything? And if they wouldn't want then why would they? Simple answer would be not to right?  Why not keep playing on the version you put 400-1000 hours in?
---
Holy shit I forgot all about FISTO
---
Overhand or underhand?
---
I have 4
---
X01 with shocks and jetpack
---
X01 with shocks and stealthboy
---
Excavator with shocks
---
Ultracite (don't really use it)
---
I keep the jetpack one on me for normal use and the excavator in case I get over encumbered.  (To be honest, I've been over encumbered for the last month)
---
"Centralized player hub"   
---
"Unlockable at level 50"   
---
Choose one
---
I can't wait for the  *WTS TSE PST, instant delivery* spam
---
All rise twisted muscles all the melee work cards and max strength all rise = 1000~ with bobble heads and crits.....yea
---
Yep, the mod you get from the quest (it's listed as optional) is actually pretty op for a stealth build.
---
end of the 3rd floor where the hand reader is on the wall for no reason.
---
And I'm 100% down to do that so speak for yourself, so are a lot of people I know. Read the comments here, plenty of people would get behind it.
---
Yeah, they no longer give massages due to "incidents."
---
Miss Lotus is sitting in a dumpster in a back hallway of Whitesprings.  it makes me sad.
---
Ya I hate it too but at least it works out
---
The glitch is back. I moved yesterday and everything duplicated and crops even more. I only had 10 of each and now I have over 60 of each.
---
My point stands.
---
two shot gave +100% weapon dmg but the second shot didnt get the effects of your perks Iirc
---
The lore of Vault 76 is that it was made to be purposefully uninhabitable once people left so they could not just return for shelter. But yes, a hub somewhere for future player vendors would be great. 
---
Exactly. You just proved my point. Everyone would stay on the normal servers to keep their progress... Which is why Bethesda wont make them that way.  
---
Thank you for the further explanation. 
---
Cant have over achievers in the force, it'll make everyone at 5/10 look bad.
---
im using a regular ps4 thats over 5 years old,  i crashed once in the first couple minutes after the recent patch, but since then no disconnects since tuesday morning, thats over 20 playinghours without a disconnect 
---
Nice quote. But you probably shouldn't also have linked to the evidence of the second sentence..."A prequel is a work that forms part of a backstory to the preceding work." While you could argue that it thematically precedes Fallout 4, I havnt seen one thing that links the story of 76 to that of Fallout 4. 
---
And/or +20% ammo weight reduction (my build is auto pistol stealth...)
---
Still better though right? Just not game breaking better
---
How do you spawn a new world? You just mean log out and back in so the world will new to you but maybe already looked right? 
---
People like the T60 because it's cheap to fix, BUT the X01 doesn't ever break.  I have literally never repaired mine and I've been using it for 50 levels.
---
Other MMO has different chat rooms, Trade, Guild, World, Party, Private etc.  Can have multiple windows open with different chat channels.  When I played DDO, they had that, wonderful feature.
---
You can’t shoot out people you don’t like if they don’t shoot you back or are in pacifist mode so no. I don’t think you understand you can’t pk just anyone if they don’t don’t trigger pvp, event or not. I purposefully don’t turn on pacifist because I’m looking for people willing to engage in pvp. Some people decide to engage. Not being able to fight them, like the point of pvp, is absolutely a bug. If events were hippie gun free zones then they wouldn’t be able to shoot the wanted player either since the wanted player themselves is already rendered harmless in the first place.
---
I think XB1 players are a lot more vocal about everything. 
---
Great to see there are people who truly enjoy the game. I'm lvl 85, been playing since BETA and still can't wait to log in every night to see what awesome new location I will find! See you in the wasteland!
---
they specifically said it is a completely separate game mode in the main menu.
---
&gt;want to clarify that this mode will be playable separately- it will be a new option accessed from the main menu.
---
&gt;the rules for pvp outside as they currently are in the game are not changing outside of the new mode.
---
&gt;think of it like playing the game you're playing right now but with no PvP rules.
---
Nah I agree with that. Just don't agree with their method.
---
The only good wood armour I've gotten was an 3* unyeilding with +1 str and 20% wep weight reduction. But other than that, nothing makes me rage more than killing a legendary enemy and seeing a weightless wood right leg or something. 
---
Well, sure they are garbage to the strictly superior two shot and exploding. 
---
At least now, the +30% to scorched can outperform the damn +100% to everything in some situations. And to me, this makes them more interesting.
---
Also, I'll just ignore the fact you think time move in only one direction.
---
no, because some people actually read yesterday's Inside the Vault.
---
This is not an MMO
---
Thanks. I'll try that. I had just taken the weapon and armour out of the stash to upgrade them, as the last time I'd logged in, it hadn't worked, so I took them out to try again. Sadly no change.
---
add 2 pounds of the second missile in the chamber
---
add 3 pound of science and bingo
---
1 shotting someone who isnt flagged has been debunked as a myth. Check out u/-baloo 's post, he linked a vid of someone with 240k damage attacking a person in pacifist and slap damage was capped around 5 dmg per hit.
---
Than the user runs and easily one shots a couple lvl 65 mobs and one shots a SBQ with the same build.
---
Some things to remeber about flagging for pvp -
---
If you own a workshop, and someone attempts to take it away from you, you are both flagged and any members of each team are also flagged EVEN with pacifist on. The moment they try to cap you are flagged, there is no first shot/slap damage.
---
If you are on a team and any memeber of said team flags for pvp it flags the ENTIRE team.
---
My friend got a grill plan the scorchbeast queen

We followed the quest prompts and missed a huge part of the Forest until it was too easy. Everything between Morgantown and Charleston is good for your level as long as you don't go East of the big cliffs (i.e. to the big red spiky ski resort building)
---
I was about to say this. I played a lot of WoW just because I paid 20$ and back in my childhood 20$ was a lot and so I felt myself forced to play it..
---
No just the ones crying, others would probably just play both. 
---
I'm so wandering over there and checking that out right now.

I do have to agree. It’s not bloodied itself but it’s the way it scales and how you can use an excessive amount of buffs through other items to make it insanely strong. Let me state as well I have no issues with them nerfing TSE. I have an issue with how much they are nerfing it. They should’ve done it in scales after they fixed the bobble heads. Drop it 10%, then slowly go down until they hit a decent number where it’s still useful but not op. I think they should do the same with melee or put a cap on what you can receive buff wise from items. I think they’re going about the situation completely wrong and there are better ways of doing it. The current problem is TSE looks extremely op due to the bobble head situation. Players who don’t know these glitches just see guys shredding the scorch queen and other mobs extremely fast and assume it’s the weapon itself. When in reality the guy is running around with 200k damage from stacking bobble heads. I don’t feel as if it’s fair for pvp or the community. But some of these same people also don’t know how to make their build and use the perks in place for these builds. They just see you 1 shorting mobs they can’t one shot and get mad over it. These same guys who are raging about TSE are going to rage about melee when the melee builds come back and start shredding everything. Then it will be “nerf the melee builds. They’re coming through and 1 hitting all of my mobs. It’s not fair”. This group of people will never be happy unless you don’t know how to play your perks and dumb yourself down to their level of damage. Which I also don’t find fair. 
---
That would be crazy broken idk 
---
Were you on PC? I saw a base like the one you described and it was really helpful. If it was you, I thank you for the weapons workbench, my axe was just about broken.
---
I think instigating explosive Dragon and Furious Explosive Handmade are going to be the new top dogs. Bloodied explosive combat shotty might also be a solid one.
---
Notice how they all have one word in common lol.
---
Yes. Varies from 20 to 40
---
Too many unhappy endings
---
Saw a video where a utuber used mods and removed all the doors of the bunkers.  
---
They were all pretty much empty rooms beside the two u can into.  
---
Great work! How about a Scorchbeast?
---
Are cheers, I alway thought they used asphalt/tarmac for roads and pavement because it can easily be removed and replaced if they want to lay more pipes or cables. 
---
I dont do it. Imjust repeating what i see
---
Well after reading the newest "Into the Vault" it looks like there will be dedicated PvP servers coming
---
Repeating everyone else's comments, no need to rush through the story. Take your time and explore the west side of the map - the enemies are generally tamer, and even if there are level 50+ players around, the enemy levels are still capped to reasonable levels. 
---
Also, enemy type matters almost as much as enemy level. Even in your current state, you might be able to take down a level 40 Scorched Warrior or Feral Ghoul, for example, whereas a Lt. Gutsy or a Super Mutant with a rocket launcher would tear you up. 
---
Bahahhaahahahhahahahaha.   Also, to the mole miner that blew me up at level 4, whyyyyyy? And to my mom that beat me in candy Land at age 5, whyyyyyy ?????
---
Now I'm scarred for life and can't function as an adult *shits pants*
---
I get it where I spawn can't do anything and my base hasn't loaded yet. When it does load if I've moved 7/10 I'll get stuck in my building as its randomly appeared. So I just have to sit and wait when it "loads" 
---
Yeah ok dude. At least half of these comments are disagreeing with you which is another example of at least half the people,wouldnt play it which osnt what Bethesda,wants. I'm done with thos conversation now as nothing you say will,change the fact that it isnt happening.
---
We can turn on nuke power plants but we can't repurpose, retrofit and repair the Vault with all the super tech and building mats we have found out in the world?  ;)
---
No they wouldn’t, whatre they gonna do? Slap dmg you to death as if you wouldn’t notice your health being lowered 1 hp at a time. At 300 hp I’d probably just drink water and out heal them.
---
Right!? It should give you some sort of exlusive!
---
No the explosive weight reduction perk is needed for missiles, mini nukes, 40mm, and then grenades of course
---
Waste of ammo lol
---
I'm curious to know if my two shot non-explosive is only going to do 25% for the second shot yet still use twice the ammo.
---
Various events (the messenger, nuke silos etc) give you more than 40. 
---
Good post!  I like the 50% cap travel idea. Also I love server effects for completing events. 
---
To add, even "bad" events would be welcome, like post nuke less scorched but rads release in the area increases the chance for spawning several super powered legendary ghouls across the server for say an hour...
---
In reply to your post: 
---
No
---
My behaviour ingame hasn't changed at all, but the cores disappear at a MUCH higher rate than they did before yesterday. 
---
No no no.  He the level 6 is ruined.  They wanted to play carbare adventure not this irradiated wasteland game :( 
---
They just didn't appreciate the unique service
---
I Have the newer regular ps and sometimes i can go hours without problems then sometimes cant even go to whitedprings cause of the stutter, lag and dc
---
I find power attacks put a massive drain on cores.  Usually I run around swinging 2 handed melee with no power attacks and see minimal core drain.
---
That is the urban scout armor mask.  There is a forest scout armor mask as well.  Same thing, but green instead of blue.
---
I think there is a terminal nearby that says what is in each dome, as well as the state of each (ie high radiation detected, flooded, etc) 
---
Honestly... get rid of diseases and hunger/thirst.  Not that these elements are too hard.  They aren't, they're just ANNOYING.  They don't contribute to the fun of playing at all!
---
Some idiot who managed to get into Vault 76 and is here to seek vengeance against Timothy from being a slob and stealing my giddyup buttercup &gt;:(
---
Hmm...so pick up my corn Corn before I move again
---
I don't care if it doesn't happen I'll still play it?  But youre done now for the second time and have made that last comment for the fourth time now, why keep responding? Lmfao
---
Do you have high charisma? The most I've had is 40
---
Full Support from me
---
I have ye olde brick original and haven't blue screened once since the new patch with 30+ hours accumulated after, normally I'd blue screen at least once a day
---
The Enclave is very strict with following orders to the letter. They said TEN commendations, not ELEVEN! THAT'S INSUBORDINATION, SOLDIER!!!
---
I genuinely like 76 as well.  I'm certainly not immune or ignorant to its problems, but the game capitalizes on the things I like most about Bethesda's games - aimless exploration, self-guided adventuring, and a lot of odd little stories to discover.  The addition of other players just adds a wildcard factor to things, and helps with that quality you mention where your attention is yanked toward several different goals at once.
---
I also take it slow.  The only time I can honestly say I grinded for something was on the lucky chance that I got Marsupial and had to fight and micromanage Rads for two levels to get both the Starched Genes perks.  But that was fun.  It turned the game mechanics upside-down for a bit.
---
It's become a game sort of like Cities Skylines or The Sims 4 to me... where I look forward to relaxing and playing it at the end of the day.  It's not a deep commitment, and I'm not making profound moral choices, but it's a fun place to screw around and work toward your own goals from one day to the next.

This was my set up a year ago. I have an addiction and have bought way more stuff since then! 
---
Nope (5). The messenger is a guaranteed 100 caps for me. Not sure if it scales with your level. 
---
I got cannibalized and just started laughing madly, that has got to be one the best game mechanics yet.
---
I'd disagree here. Melee weapons require a ton of perks +Assassin Armor and more tanky perks ( maybe some mutations too). TSE weapons can do 2x the damage of a melee on its on
---
 Melees overpowered, but at the cost of perk points and time. You can't just dupers melee weapons without the perks to make it good.
---
Thanks, I appreciate  it.

Got a suppressor super sledge 2 star lv50

Oh believe I'm not complaining mines instigating explosive but I only take her for sbq fights otherwise the game is no fun lol
---
I'll buy the bloodied ripper ig is JWCIII
---
its the screws and springs
---
What is ur gamertag 
---
Since you seem to be well versed in taking down the SBQ, I could use some wisdom.
---
How do you deal with the event when it gets over populated with low level players doing nothing?  I'm going into the fight wielding a 3k damage lever rifle, and when starting the event, I'm dropping her health quite noticeably.  Then about 2-3mins in the entire server shows up and I can't seem to do any damage, and definitely not enough damage to compensate for all the people who just showed up.
---
I could really use some insight here, as I've got about a 50/50 success rate on the queen and its ALWAYS a matter of how many low levels show up.
---
Me too. In any player community hub, whether vault or resort or player town or rebuilt city.
---
I could see this if they were able to make the shelves/displays act as offshoots of the existing stash amount.  For instance, you put 6 teddybears in your stash and choose on the shelf to display these items - and they stay as long as they're in the stash.  This would minimize the impact of keeping track of more items in the house.
---
Original PS4. Have had two or three blue screens during release week. Nothing notable since. 78ish hours played all over map. I believe most blue screens were while trying to craft in the bunker areas for whatever reason. 
---
Not so easy to find linings for the wetsuit. But you can start by doing Census Violence Events I'm the Cranberry Bog, as well as scanning Harper's Ferry. First building upper left floor should have antique cabinets with plans and I think the wetsuit. There are also a few other posts discussing this)
---
Yes, but a completely negligible amount. As in, you kill 30 Mole Miners during an event, and get 30 caps for it. But each enemy drops a shotgun. Each shotgun sells for 10-20 caps. Same with other enemies, Supermutants during big events often end up dropping WAY more caps than what the event awards. And worse still, paying to fast-travel to a short, timed event, even with Travel Agent perk, often costs as much as the event will pay you for completing it.
---
Cool.
---
Nuka fridge and my Quantum!
---
I am the zoning inspector!  When i come across a C.A.M.P. that is built without proper support beams or other dangerous code violations, i level it, get on mic and explain why, then give them time to rebuild up to code before i return with a cap fine or more explosives.
---
You can get into the bunker from the resort without using the service entrance. 
---
It’s great but everything weighs a ton and it’s also resource heavy in use, you’ll often find yourself needing to seek out super mutants and mole miners for grenades and missiles respectively. 
---
This is the thing that people don't get as they panic sell their TSE's. They're still going to be useful weapons, they're just not going to be the end-all and be-all of legendary weapons while all others are useless in comparison. TSE's will still be an excellent choice against low DR enemies, while anti-armor will take up the mantle as the new king against higher DR enemies like scorchbeasts. As it stands I've been running an antiarmor and a TSE handmade side by side and find the antiarmor is at least as effective against a level 80 scorchbeast as a TSE, maybe even more so.
---
Or even loading screen minigames. I'm pretty sure the patent on them ran out.
---
Lvl 90, I'll have to hop on after work and see again.
---
I know, I was trying to get to that stash box, but I was overweight, and then the nukes came in with no alert for some reason and the entire place was radiated. I barely got my weak hazmat suit out of the crate before becoming 80% radiated. 
---
I got an instigating rolling pin with 40% faster swing speed and +1 to either agility or strength, I can't recall which. Its honestly one of my favorite weapons. Upgraded to chefs rolling pin and add some spikes and that thing is LETHAL.
---
Hey look, it's a time scientist. Maybe you will drop a quest where we go retrieve time gizzards from mutant bloatflies.
---
Really? can you link to me where they specifically say pvp servers and not a vague hint at pvp mode? 
---
Because that is the definition of hype and speculation
---
I dont think its the consoles fault, probalby servers just cant take all of it 
---
I usually develop an addiction after 3+ alcoholic beverages. See if that works for you.
---
What a waste of time this has been. Grind for weeks to get the best stuff then they go and make it useless. Like I'm gonna chase whatever is top after this nerf all the while they shove overpriced skins ripped from the game.
---
That called speculation dude 
---
it can spawn at drop cite c2, west cranberry bog
---
also mirelurk queen can drop the marine wetsuitt and helmet
---
watoga bos vendor will sell all lining but shielded bos lining which is a reward  from forbidden knowledge
---
Rail cars on railroad along Watoga. Had the plans spawn several times. Reliable location for everything marine.
---
Yeah, and the resort exit has a loading screen attached to it.
---
Your BS so hard it's not even fun, even if he did 1 shot he would need to boblehead stack abuse and with that's not melee fault. And yes I'm melee main and u don't come near 1shot the queen with a bloodied unyielding 
---
my super sledge is 90% off and is 8 pounds but 2 pounds if I switch mods they really need to fix that bug
---
I shouldn’t have been carrying it, I was trying to build the excavator arms and legs that’s why I had it on me, but ended up trapped, overnight and then the place gets nuked. Series of unfortunate events. 
---
On XBox, you can view anyone's profile and join their game.  (Assuming their privacy settings allow it, I guess.  There was one person who asked me to join their game but it didn't show him as being in a game.  He had to invite me before I could do it.)
---
Yeah, well the stealthboy uses AP, so that'll be an issue.
---
An 80% Nerf?...... okay you have a point.......they didn't Nerf it 100%. I think my radium stock does something like 56 damage and takes me about 40 rounds to kill one super mutant..........with perks and explosive it does 196 now so it only takes me 11 shots to kill one super mutant. 
---
I don't PvP. I'm in pacifist mode at all times. I have absolutely no interest in PvP. I'm a solo player so when I spawn 20 super mutants I'm on my own. My explosive radium rifle made the game playable for me......it is far from being OP for a solo player. When I do go to Whitesprings I switch to melee weapons so that everyone can get hits in for XP and legendary drops.
---
I play Fallout games depending on what drops I get. This time around the RNG decided I was going with a rifle build. The radium is what dropped for me. Basically this Nerf is a reset on my level 110 character and I am far from being happy about it.
---
i have had to move my CAMP a few times since the patch but haven't experienced any of the above issues. I think right now that's the only thing i don't have issues with. I recently scrapped all items in my last move and redid my CAMP. After reading many posts about removing turrets, i finally did that and love the extra space i have to build more.
---
[like I said, inside the vault, very easy to find and verify yourself.](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/1pB3jkcq5unlYTB3TTURrZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-17-2019)
---
&gt;We’ve received questions about our new mode and want to clarify that this mode will be playable separately – it will be a new option accessed from the Main Menu. This mode will be designed for fans that want a more hardcore PvP experience. The rules of PvP as they currently are in the game are not changing outside of the new mode.
---
You may recall late last year we mentioned we’re working on a new way of playing the game that removed PvP restrictions. While we’re still doing some tweaking and adding, we thought we’d give you a little more info to go on. Think it of it like playing the game you’re playing right now, but with no PvP rules. 
---
Thanks for the offer, but I'm on PS4 unfortunately. And yea, I figure the servers will be stable enough at some point for this to not be an issue, but given its instability issues during normal gameplay, I think we are a ways off. Just going to be patient and do other stuff until that day comes. I've still yet to launch my first nuke, which will be aimed straight at White Springs
---
Also spawn a real life NPC that knocks on my door and pistol whips me
---
meanwhile pistols get ZERO armor pen perks. Tank Killer should apply to ALL weapons (not melee). 
---
Not using a single melee perk all my str perks are for weight reduction. Only using martial artist, and I'm doing fine
---
Mutations are free buffs and shouldnt be an argument Imo :/ Many of them are a must have no matter what build you are playing
---
Almost guaranteed to happen. Currently TSE weapons are what allows guns to compete, sort of. After the nerf, the force discrepancy between melees and ranged will become utterly obscene. Which is going to end in a nerf.
---
Having said that, I wish melee was actually properly done in this game. With good, responsive block and dodge controls. So that we can actually fight enemies with player skill, not just face-tanking or 1-shotting them.
---
No one will use that mode anyway. Just like Hunter/Hunted. Played it once during BETA, and never again, because it never reaches 4 players.
---
Um. Fallout 76 uses fallout 4
---
Why a separate server when all they need to do is tweek pacifist mode to make it so that when enabled you can't damage other players and CAMPs, and other players can't damage you or your CAMP. Also to avoid griefing, you need to not have engaged in PVP for at least 2mins before you can enable pacifist, so ppl can't shoot and destroy stuff and immediately enable pacifist to avoid getting killed. 
---
Mix some blood, sweat, and tears into that science and I think you're onto something. 
---
It's the same as eating a 2 oz. cookie and gaining 10 lbs.
---
You got a really good view of the fireworks. I built my camp on one the white springs golf fields so if you want to visit you can
---
too bad only the pc players will get all that crap from mods
---
Yea, and it would be a really good idea to fix all the duping methods AND then do this forced restart in the new mode...  Because even with a fresh start with separate characters you'll have folks duping explosive bobbleheads and guns as soon as they can grind them up in whitesprings...
---
I agree. Or just change the challenge to 760 hours
---
love this, I'd love to see someone in power armour, your choice of model, raining hell down on a scorchbeast with a minigun
---
Youtube? Sunk Cost? Lmao

Hell let’s drop everything that’s not stored in stash NOW that would be something. 
---
They will still be the best weapons in game. They will just vastly be out perfomed by melee weapons for a while, which makes sense balance wise. 
---
Workshop opened you up to pvp, best to avoid unless you want to be looking over your shoulder.  Pacifist mode will not prevent this from happening, it is part of the game mechanic, you want resources be prepared to defend them.  Pacifist will prevent you from accidentally damaging another player, if you are attacked and do not wish to engage do not return fire.  If you are in a team and one of your mates engages it will open you up as well.  Also, do not seek  revenge, it marks you as PVP immediately.
---
7600 hours? Heck, they should give you a day pass so you can get some sun.
---
Young man it's time you learn some respect, come with us, me and your mom are going to alberto's
---
Eating your opponent should be the only real reward you need when you are trying to survive in the wasteland of west by god virginia!
---
But you make even more caps from killing the people trying to kill you. Way more than any event could give even if you account for the fact that eventually, yes, you will have to get that 10 cap bounty removed somehow. I can make upwards of 1k caps in about half an hour if I’m lucky by standing at vault 76 with a bounty and just killing everyone that tries to claim it.
---
Oh man, that last part is mind blowing. I always assumed the raw fluxes decayed to nothing and was totally purplexed as to why I all of a sudden had like 40 of these "Inert Flux" thingys. I assumed I had gotten them from a mission and didn't notice.
---
That's pretty much what I said in my edit.  
---
I feel dumb having to go back to using my Black Powder Rifle versus my Two shot .44
---
The thing about the vault becoming uninhabitable is mostly just because the air is turned off and everything is shut down. But what's to stop you from just turning things back on. Even if the system were designed to not be restarted, you could retrofit new technology or remove/repair the systems that aren't functioning. A vault is pretty much just a fancy hole in the ground with an air conditioner.
---
*two shot lever action*

Your house probably exceeded budget and you clearly have duped weapons, I'd kill you too

Sorry you got no answers or ideas, I'm reaching this level now so I'll save this thread for later.

Recent players on Xbox.  It's how I join back after a crash during a Nuke if there is space.

I think asking for everyone to stop suggesting certain categories of stuff is unreasonable.  Like I want robot companions as they were in fo4.  I have no idea if that would be considered too difficult for them.  I personally think it's an awesome idea and would like them to do it though.  If it's not in the cards, then so be it.
---
I have one stumbled across only 1 guy doing this to me, and I have more than 100 hours into de game. Everyone else I have cross paths with was really cool, some high level players even dropping legendaries and stuff. Just switch servers when you come across someone like those griefers
---
they wont add that because the players will be able to abuse public workshops 
---
That would be an exodus of every player who is only tolerating the PVP. But if it were a dedicated player mode? I could see that, sure.
---
Yes, Whitespring, the place that gets nuked every other day.
---
It free if you sit in Radiation Barrels and get lucky, but you have to pay 3800 for the specific one you want, and how much strength do you have?
---
A friend of mine has that station on all the time and says he also can't ever get to 4.
---
God I miss fisto. I wish bethesda would include him into the game so I can keep it around my camp for those lonely nights in the wasteland. 
---
Finally someone understands that low hp bloody builds are the most tanky build in the game
---
Right. Laser weapons need a buff. Doubt anyone will argue that.
---
Doesn't mean melee needs a nerf. 
---
Those aren't battered... SCREWS!!!!
---
Recent players list on Xbox.  I did read once someone sending friend requests and the person who killed them accepting.  Dumb.
---
It’s not a bug, though.  And we all have All Rise.
---
All fine for some, for the rest that don't want to participate in pvp, I'm sure losing ammo to someone they didn't want to fight would be irritating to say the least. Pacifists mode doesn't always work in some cases either and people are killed before running away. I would find it very frustrating to have to serve hop because of the occasional troll going around solely trying to kill and take ammo or aid.
---
I always thought for camp vendors it would be neat and tidy if we could repurpose an Eyebot like we did with ED-E in New Vegas.  They broadcast messages and signals already, we just change it to broadcast our camp location and they can make or play a message audio to get people to notice where they are in the camp and locally.  They also could be another form of security against mobs and ppl attacking your base if you upgrade their lasers or something maybe too.
---
I think it's more of a joke than anything. Play the game because you like it, not because of some arbitrary reward for getting to a certain amount of hours. 
---
Even pvp specific cosmetics you get from some blood money type new currency would be enough, could be camp stuff, reskins, or any number of things.  I would not like rewards that make you even better at pvp though...  Keep the combats balanced, keep the rewards quality of life/cosmetic (maybe even longer lasting more fulfilling food/drink that lasts way longer...
---
Can confirm this. 12 per 15 agi and luck.
---
Tank killer 3 is a must,.haven't seen it mentioned here. I run 3 conc fire and rifleman as well. 2 expert and 1 master. Gun Fu is great in agi if you are vats, but I'm not sure if rank 3 is required. I'm still deciding.
---
Action boy 3 is essential to. I only have rank 2 sneak. I run 22 agi regularly with buffs and mutations and go almost unnoticed by everything. Covert operative 3 is a must as well.
---
For luck, like was stated, crit savvy and better crit. Clover and psychopath aren't needed with this buiid. With savvy and 15 luck you'll be getting crits every other shot. I run 3 savvy, 3 better, 2 starched, 3 class freak, and I used to run 3 grim reaper but have changed it for quality of life perks because I just don't need it 
---
Mutations I have are speed, adrenal, bird, eagle, marsupial, grounded (i don't gauss so not sure if this affescts that), and two others I can't remember at the moment.
---
This build is very strong pve.
---
Yeah but they can't hold a pen properly.
---
&gt;What is draining when I use VATS while not wearing power armor?
---
Staying in VATS while not wearing power armor drains your AP.
---
It will change a lot in that it forces lazy players to face an actual challenge. Two shot combat shotgun with no perks already rides 190 damage, don't act like two shot isn't a huge fucking advantage and over powered ffs 
---
Nah, I much prefer having my own photos. I just wish it wasn't like to 50.
---
There are a couple wiki pages that have some info on the events. 
---
If we can gamble our plethora of caps for sweet possible loot from the Atom store or plans/weapons etc... I'm down!

I'm now wondering if the randoms I've seen offering crap like a can of dog food for 25,000 caps had their finger slip or not. 
---
if this is in fact just a "hardcore mode" of the game we know already (as their wording has lead us to believe), it's very likely that these characters will be completely separate of the ones linked to the original servers. 
---
I agree but they could embrace the joke with a funny cosmetic or something. It would let people know that I either have no life, or that I don't sleep (choose one they both apply XD)
---
What really busted my balls...
---
Waiting through the initial loading screen, pop up on the map.
---
Only to have it freeze to load, seconds after the loading screen...
---
duped items will be on players, not NPC vendors 
---
ahh ok forgot about that perk. 
---
Or you could just trade the Radium and get a rifle better suited for your playstyle? 
---
Sounds like, the way you play, you need a Instigating rifle.
---
If you are on XB1 I’ll trade you a TSE Handmade for it lol
---
Most Two handed do 200+ with slugger and other perks. One handed 200+ is where it's at. 
---
so your idea of balance is making good stuff garbage?
---
Bahahaha. Then the fallout market went from TSE to AA/furious/instigating. 
---
Ohh, I haven’t been back since the latest update. Good to know
---
Pacifist doesn't stop you from taking damage or getting eaten lol
---
Fair enough. 
---
BLAH BLAH BLAH
---
a new option on the main menu isn't going to bring you to the same servers. that's nonsensical. if we were going to be playing in the same servers with optional rules, then they would include those in the pause menu or settings.
---
You mad bro?
---
I got an explosive radium rifle which as a non PvP player is a step down from your combat rifle. It's far from OP but it makes the game feel more balanced to me as a solo player.
---
It would be great if I could carry an exterminator, a mutant Slayer, an anti scorch, etc........but carry weight is a major problem which makes most every legendary effect useless 90% of the time.
---
I built my character around the drops that I got and now I feel like at level 110 Bethesda just reset my character and my gun wasn't even a TSE.
---
An 80% a nerf on explosive alone is stupid..... I'm probably done with 76 after that.
---
The other factor is that the 2 bullets do not always hit, so there is not a flat 25% increase since there is risk of inaccuracy 
---
Well that escalated quickly lol
---
*grinded days and days to get a good gun*
---
Yeah right 
---
4,000 caps is for the serum (one time use). The recipes are way more expensive (\~20,000-25,000 caps) and rarely seen. 
---
[RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gSQg1i_q2g)
---
I recommend a Bloodied build, with the right perks and any old bloodied axe you can do up to 790 at around 40% health. Even more if you are at 20% or lower. (I use a 1* Bloodied Grognak and I can do up to 5k alone and 12k on a team)
---
&gt;I do however believe that Bethesda needs to be held accountable for their mistakes with this game.  And that unless it's hammered home, they're going to repeat these mistakes with Fallout 5 and the next Elder Scrolls game. Mostly I think we need to know what happened, why did it happen, and who was responsible. That way we know which actual specific game designers/writers we should NEVER buy games from again. I mean if I ever see the name Doug Mellencamp on a game again, I'm OUT.
---
What mistakes are you talking about exactly, the fact that they managed to turn a single player engine into a multiplayer one?
---
the fact that a open world game using creation engine IS ALREADY GOING TO BE BUGGY BASED ON THE SHEER NUMBER OF SHIT IN IT with out adding more than 1 player to it?
---
the fact that even in every game there are bugs because unlike pokemon you can not catch them all and meet release dead lines?
---
the fact that you all abuse the fuck out of servers trying to get what you want by server hoping?
---
the fact that you all dont loot your corpses leading to tons of garbage collection waiting to fire off?
---
but fuck bethesda right, fuck them for actually making fallout multiplayer..
---
how dare they do what ever it is they want with the intellectual property they own. 
---
Go find out who was actually going to make fallout MP, it was going to be Masthead studios creators of EarthRise which ended up flopping 2 weeks after release, you assholes dodged a fucking bullet you never knew was aimed right at your head. 
---
you all do this shit every fallout/elder scrolls, you complain about how great the last one is and how much this one is shit, then the next one comes out and you all bitch and moan about that one and praise the last one suddenly.
---
Fallout 4 is suddenly the best fallout ever made.
---
LETS LOOSE ALL OUR AMMO. It’s holding us back anyways!
---
I actively hunt Mirelurk Queens and have gotten 3 drops from them so far. It came with the wetsuit and the headpiece.
---
I don't think cafe means what you think it means...
---
I feel like there should've been more caps lock in there.....
---
The witches are literally any other user with a different playstyle (philosophical opponent). That's kind of the irony.
---
Bobbleheads are one example. It's unlikely you have enough via legitimate play or even trade to stack to a level that you can cause other problems with the game. Say that a player should not be able to one or two or three (or even 37) shot the queen and someone will show up to call the post _witch hunting_. It makes no sense. There's an entitlement complex present.
---
TSE are completely unbalanced. Point it out and it's witch hunting TSE users (somehow?).
---
This sub is very reactive. If it's in a YouTube video or something in-game that someone disagrees with they pretty much immediately splat it here. Any conversation that follows is generally ridiculous, and the moment Bethesda mentioned a reduction in damage to TSE well... you can see the result. People with TSE are now "victims" of unfair persecution....
---
Compare to the Bethesda forums where plenty of posts are ridiculous.... but at least every other post doesn't have something to do with witch hunting and entitlement. You can see the discussion around the Laser Gatling charging caps not being remotely similar to the DPS of the non-charging cap version. If Bethesda is sourcing feedback from an online forum they're certainly not sourcing it form here - otherwise there would be a "shove the TSE in a cooler" game mode. ;)
---
It already has built-in nerf on second bullet with accuracy
---
My experience with loading screens is that your character will always appear in the world before the loading ends. I've got out of many loading screens dead or almost dead because my hardware was old and my load times were huge. In other games I've seem my friends spawn and they told me they were still in loading screens. So if load times are big it doesn't matter if things are loading in front of you or while you're looking at a loading screen because your character is already there anyway. Maybe it's something that depends on the game, but I don't understand about that technical stuff.
---
I've been tracking data mined info and here's what I've got. The ultra-light limbs can drop from quests and events in the toxic valley. Ultra-light torso can be learned from scrapping torsos.
---
I really dont want to know how a bot like this would be fueled or with WHAT it would be fueled ! 
---
Yet somehow I never seem to get duplicate prime receiver plans.
---
Anna came from a mining family in Beckley. Spent most of her time with her favorite grandfather, who didn’t have the strength to work anymore but had always loved tinkering with things. She helped him with his projects, and took care of him, and he taught her what he knew.
---
She ended up joining the army and getting sent to Anchorage, where her unit got pinned down under heavy fire and she made one of those faith bargains where if they all survived, she’d dedicate her life to God, and they did so she did. Got pretty torn up, put back together, given a medal, hometown hero, the works, but she doesn’t talk about any of that. She’s just humble Sister Hildegard, the one with all the scars, but who doesn’t have a few of those these days? The wasteland isn’t what she was expecting, but she was spared for a reason, and she’s got a job to do. Faith and works, prayers and her trusty shotgun. Still loves to tinker in her spare time.
---
The Fabulous Arlene, on the other hand, came from money in Charleston. Youngest daughter of a ‘good’ family, always a bit wild, she discovered as a teenager while hanging out with her family’s stablehands that she was a natural at shooting. Ended up running off with a circus performer, starting a career for herself (think Annie Oakley but less frontier, more showgirl). Had some television appearances, even her own special, and then the world ended.
---
She’s been married seven times (three times before the war, twice to the same man; three late husbands in the vault whose urns she keeps in her camp, and one husband she hasn’t seen since reclamation day but he’s probably fine), calls everybody sweetie or hon, and takes a lot of pride in her appearance and putting on a good show considering, you know, wasteland. Sequin dresses and heels don’t really protect against rads though, so Arlene is a total mutant but hey, still looks good for her age.
---
He’s got a point. Atm its hard to find precious info bout the game. 
---
Now take ur medicine. 
---
Yeah, that doesn’t work.  You have to server hop for a damn hour to get 200 lead from the gym.
---
May I ask how are they nerfing it? I heard about nerfs but know nothing about what they are doing?
---
Sure, but in the time it takes to follow the stupid Messenger... barring the chance that he gets permanently stuck on something... you probably could have found more profitable methods. 😉
---
AP use drains cores. Sprinting and VATS use AP.
---
It was worth for me farming 3 days for 8 mutations, otherwise I would've payed 20k+(or maybe 5-8k when buying them from the market).
---
15STR maybe more from perks/gear
---
Yes, took me forever to get the forest mask as well but he does sell them all.
---
That even more stupid. You are labeling now people who block you griefers. What next? People who are playing in same server are going to be griefers.
---
But which enemies you mean with high energy resistant? From my mind that is only the scorchbeast? But scorchbeast is too tough for any turrets.
---
I put one shotgun inside behind the door in case someone breaks in =)
---
You gave me an I dead btw to put one miss launcher in center of my building on top of a tower and rest can be non-missile ones.
---
Lol 190 damage is nothing. With perks my shotty does around 300 which is perfect. It still take 3 or 4 shots to kill anything above lvl 50. The only lazy thing here is the nerf itself. 
---
When I go to them they just don’t have anything in them, like they’ve already been looted but I haven’t touched them
---
You could store the rad cleaner, free to store and place.
---
No prob and it does make a massive difference compared to not having it
---
Nothing new here. Game drops. Players jump in. Players find strongest gun in game. Everyone wants one. Everyone gets one. People complain "its too strong plz nerf". Company listens. We all end up shooting marshmallows. The next complaints will be how scorch queen is too hard. Seriously, the internet era is ruining gaming. This nerf everything in every game ever shit is getting real old. As if we are never allowed to have strong guns. 
---
Yea, everyone using this sub as their private message board to Bethesda is ruining the sub. Everyone feeling the need to remention the same topics as the last 6 posts is just littering the feed.
---
TSE dont exist. It 1,25-Explosive. OPFE now.
---
is instigating two shot explosive possible?
---
yeah have a friend who uses that i think missiles weight .2 instead of 2lbs
---
Nah, its been going on for a while, you must not be paying well enough attention.
---
Hi thank you for  making my weapon of  choice  weaker thus  removing   any joy I  receive  whilst playing this  game.   This  is   not  fun or fair. Officially removing the fun from my  gameplay experience.
---
Perfect.
---
I want one so bad now.
---
Don't forget that somebody salty has been downvoting every the new topic this morning! Some extra sunshine and cheer!
---
Oh i know, however you still have idiots in that game complaining about not being able to earn plat, with out having to trade with other players. 
---
exact same shit is happen here, Beth didnt have to give us in game challenges to earn atoms, they could have made it 100% RMT only.  Yet players can earn Atoms and still bitch about the prices... they literally refresh challenges daily/weekly and even have character challenges people can earn atoms with by.. .shock... making a 2nd toon... and then deleting said toon and.... making another one. 
---
I need another 100 pounds of carry weight so I can carry one of each of the situational legendaries.
---
Instigating is still shit when it takes 20+ shots for a solo player to kill most enemies. Cool I hit him for extra damage on my first shot now I only need to shoot him 16 more times.......but wait......the other 15 super mutants are all rushing me now.
---
Nothing like a trusty 20 shot kill sniper rifle.
---
I don’t have All Rise. But I do have an instigating supersledge with 90% reduced weight. 
---
You know what they say about assuming...
---
I got exams in college rn so i'm pretty tired. My bad for messing up Fam. 
---
All Rise is my go-to melee general weapon. Is there anything which does more damage?  I have an instigating pole hook with a MOD, but All Rise is the hammer for scorchbeasts, yaoguai, death claw. 
---
K'un Lun awaits.
---
I’m still upset about the TSE thing. I paid for one on the market ):
---
Thanks dude it clearly was added on much later then the original posting so I didn't see it. 
---
 \- But the barrel is huge! It could take me all night!
---
\- Plenty of time, my sweet. Plenty of time. 
---

There was hardly any. Didnt mean to let you down 
---
A mod is just a plan to create it. Modding it itself is using physical materials to make it.
---
How much do you think a blueprint for a skyscrapper weighs? 500,000 tons?
---
r/unexpectedfuturama
---
First lvl 50 legendary my melee char found was her furious, 40% swing speed super sledge. Living the melee dream. 
---
I absolutely hate the droning mayor's dialogue that goes with it, but the quest itself is definitely one of the more memorable. I still find it weird that other "Grafton monsters" can show up outside of that town, since it seemed like a special one-off deal with all the build-up. 
---
yeah, im sorry, i saw the "update" on it when i first read it last night, so i didn't really think about there being a gap between when this info was revealed. hadn't considered that some missed the update.
---
Then there's me trying to take advantage and buy a TSE gatling gun for cheap
---
yes just nerf them on players !
---
It's been said before but we need to have the daily and weekly goals posted on the loading screen.  At least we can spend our time doing something productive
---
I hate that they're doing this.  Absolutely hate it.
---
I've been a big proponent of the game since I first played it.  I have been planning to buy it on PC (already have it for XBox).  Now I'm going to hold off on the PC purchase.  They're sucking fun or convenient things out, in order to make us grind more.  What's next?
---
It's ok. I could still feel the passion. 
---
And how did you come to that conclusion exactly?
---
Okay so the problem isn't there not being a stash box, it's being lazy to walk upstairs.
---
this is from a mod but i think it sort of shows why masks would reduce perception: [https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ClXOpr2hr5o/maxresdefault.jpg](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ClXOpr2hr5o/maxresdefault.jpg)
---
I randomly found the plans on a table just outside big bend tunnel in the ash heap
---
Just like every day someone comes to complain about the vendor system or SBQ dropping terrible loot. Like cmon guys it’s 3 months post launch you are not this amazing player who just figured this out for everyone.
---
My bald cahracter recieved a reward for the best looking hair when I was leaving the vault. That's enough of a backstory for me.
---
it has chairs, staff, food, music and a view.  
---
but also seeing the effort put into some of the more nefarious yet inviting looking places, figured it good to be careful 
---
After backlash they changed it. It will no longer be removed and both effects are being nerfed.
---
Maybe the idea of a bunch of situational legendary perks doesn't work so well with a 250lb carry weight.
---
Nothing like facing down a mob of super mutants with an exterminator rifle......too bad I left my mutant Slayer at home.
---
He is who he is
---
Anyone else think doing this is an exploit?
---
Yep, that's a great weapon. From what I understand anti-armor is 50% armor ignored. Against heavily armored enemies that means the damage will go up a straight 20% or more. 40% extra power attack damage is just silly as well, because 40% is a hell of a lot of damage on top of the double damage for power attack. Your buddy should be thrilled.
---
FO76 uses the same engine and a lot of the same assets as FO4.  That doesn't mean that they're the same.  Story has a lot to do with things, as well as characters.  If someone didn't like FO4's main story, or found some if the characters annoying, then they may have disliked it.  Since those elements aren't in FO76, there's a chance they might enjoy FO76.
---
Personally, I stopped playing FO4 when I found my son.  Yeah, the main quest line had a ways to go, but for me it was over.  I found Valentine's story much more enjoyable than the main story.
---
They dont need a nerf. If you play your cards right in pvp, you don't need to get within range of a melee attack. Plus you can just use enforcer and a pump shotgun to keep them from getting to you
---
so glad i went with a junkie’s explosive lever rifle build instead
---
So with out mutations and bobble heads i have all the melee 2h perks and then i repair my super sledge to 200%, which means i do around 285 +15  damage
---
That's bullshit. I have a pistol alt, with 9 points invested in pistol dmg, I need at least 5 bullet to finish a 62 ghoal.
---
With tse revolver I need 3 shot to kill a super mutent
---
As long as both combatants had PVP enabled.
---
If I’m in pacifist mode, get murdered and lose half my shit I’m not going to be having a good time, mmmkay?
---
&gt; furious
---
Now i want a bloodied, furious, with a 40% swing speed. 
---
....Im not greedy at all. 
---
The weapons aren't being removed from the game, just from your ability to get them. As a result, the two shot economy goes hard on the demand side and non-existent on the supply side. Now the only way to get your hands on them will be to find someone who knows how to dupe.
---
link to the announcement?
---
You must not have seen their revision of Inside the vault. They are not removing them as was originally stated. They are only nerfing them. 
---
Honestly, I didn't notice the other images and thought the only one was the one of the crafting benches, lol
---
Scared piece of trash who runs in, does what needs to be done, and runs out. I just finished recruitment blues at level 24 and I plan on soloing the scorchbeast queen at level 30 max 
---
Fisto should have been in every game made after New Vegas. But, sadly, Bethesda won't include anything from NV in Fallout proper, just out of spite.
---
Holding a 10-year grudge because another studio made a better game than you is so unattractive, Pete. It's how you get payback like The Outer Worlds.
---
unless you were like me and didnt realize which quests gave end game stuff. my all rise was lvl 30 and i sold it. luckily i found an anti armor war drum on my first nuke after 50 thats been serving me well enough when i'm force to power armor and cant use my deadly deadly fists
---
the lack of self awareness in this post is astounding smh
---
I can see why he can be seen as a prick, but not a troll. Wanting to PvP and raise Bounty quickly on your head by destroying peoples' Workshop (or C.A.M.P) is merely causing trouble as the game intended to be possible. If the IGN you mention is not made up, revealing that makes you a dick.
---
I bet I'll finally get my first Explosive mod weapon the day after this patch drops.  
---
Are you serious?? GO LOOK AT THE 30 POSTS ABOUT IT!!
---
Nah, its not your fault. Theyre nerfing the Explosive effect from 100% to 20%. I think theyre making the TS less likely to drop or something.
---
My post is less about that, and more about people reposting the same shit like they are more interesting than the last. Theyre not. 
---
Though it is a shame that everyones complaints have them nerfing gun effects all across the board, rather than where they are a real problem. PvP.
---
Setting up back alley Markets for such weapons then..😏
---
yes you can find them from doing the treasure hunt maps there might be other ways of obtaining those blueprints
---
Time to play Moo-Moo's favorite game - Follow that smell!
---
I love this. But I would want the option to ride the ski lifts.
---
Levels 15 to 19 at Harper's ferry until they fix that loot table.
---
Damn, it's the same as a normal cannibalism. I would have loved it if instead the player would take a big chomp out of their neck (like Shaman from For Honor) instead of feasting on their thighs and jibbly bits.
---
There will be no pacifist mode in the new PvP server
---
I do wish people would keep it all in one thread, or if the mods would prune the sub a little more. Yesterday the front page was all angry people about TSEs. 
---
One thread is sufficient. 
---
I did a T-45 Power armor, but I’ll try what you want later
---
I never heard of anyone giving any problematic reports about the Protectron in the Atomic Wrangler.
---
I’m gonna try it!
---
You don't have to ditch workshops altogether. I run workshops every day, and I've only had PvP result from it like maybe 3 times. This has been true regardless of my level at the time. It's not as scary as it's being made to sound. Few players have any interest in your workshops whatsoever. 
---
*bad thing bad but this bad thing worse*
---
Sick political defense dude 
---
Melee players aren't a toxic fucking plague, if you're going to bitch about melee then do it correctly and at least bring up the instigating effect as the cause for the one shots. I have all of the above mentioned perks and still have to bust my in fights. And no, I don't stand a chance in a fight against one of your fake overpowered weapons, there's literally no comparison. 
---
Only if we get the Spongebob theme whenever we enter and exit...
---
The power of math compels you
---
Im not sure what youre referring to..? Like, thats why i keep saying the same stuff, because people are purposely downvoting new topics?
---
Yeah, and while you shooting and reload you get rushed by another 5 * 68
---
Yeah, but I don't know how well the fallout engine would handle things like this, especially in a multiplayer game.
---
Bad day in the wasteland..I get it.
---
Take it out on your trusting comrades. No worries....anyway,
---
I'm starting to believe TSE weapons are like unicorns.
---
I have/had some 3 star weapons, but not even close to the specs I've seen on some screen shots here.
---
I really just want a ranged weapon that's comparable to my melee damage around 350.
---
It would also be nice to be able to sell with no cap limit. I hate throwing away/scrapping good stuff...So I drop it for others, but I need caps to fast travel.  
---
If I have the goods, pay me.
---
Even when I buy a plan for 300cps, the vendor is out of caps to buy my stuff. ???
---
If only there were some way to find out for ourselves, one way or another.  Alas.  
---
True I fully agree with you. I guess we are just the rational few talking in this thread. (Which I appreciate) but yeah to make plat in Warframe you have to grind relics and check the market to see what's selling well. Shit the fish man made 30 plat off me just in the last week. And I made the plat from grinding augur mods and prime parts. It's really not hard. You can look me up on the market I have a great rating and I've made about 650 plat just this last month..I think it might be even 700+ now
---
&gt;Including the card not appearing anymore when I have the max I can use
---
Tell that to my perk packs.
---
The treehouse between Fort Venture and Harper's Ferry, on a barrel next to a work station. It may take a few hops but it's there. You get a ton of good loot to scrap as well.
---
I've read that people doing treasure hunts end up with random mod plans for pa. Do you know if one can find plans for the individual armor pieces? That would be awesome.
---
Won't cripple yourself if you have Adamantium Skeleton - I have 4 in END. Lvl 2 fire proof and lvl 2 Adamantium Skeleton. Zero limb damage if you have it maxed :) happy exploding 
---
Like the joke about the man who could only get erect by the thought of his own flaccid penis.
---
Would it make more sense to have a faction have to take a certain area on a bunch of servers in order to "claim" that area on all servers? Then you promote people to work together in their faction to all take a specific area across multiple servers. If your faction controls an area just on a few servers it would say something like "X% claimed by faction Y".  
---
I understand that there's probably thousands of servers, but it could encourage players to look at the map and go take certain areas to help their faction overall. If you take an area claimed by another faction, it would no longer benefit them on that server, and detract from their ability to hold their claim on other servers too.  
---
I think I have to draw this idea out a bit better, but I think getting people to work together across all servers (which aren't permanent) to create a more permanent thing across all servers (even new ones they spin up) is key to making the world feel more permanent without actually adding any sort of server locking.
---
Be sure to get there in time for a selfie!
---
Isn't that kind of boring, it's like God Mode cheat, what's the point?
---
There is no point in shelves at all. Bring in the Fallout 4 method of putting stuff where we want it. Though I'm guessing it has to do with being able to save your stuff and all locations. It's probably a technical issue.
---
This is what im literally saying, though Im not as sweet as you, so i get downvotes 👍
---
Not just this morning, past week at least.
---
It can be a double edged sword. Me and my gf use it, we discovered we tend to need pacifist mode so we don't explode each other.
---
Take advantage of the new change to fireproof in the endurance tree as it now provides significant defense against explosions.
---
A pure grenadier is a tough thing to make work in this game, however maxing out grenade damage is easy in this game so you can easily dual invest in whatever floats your boat. 
---
"legit pvp" means severely over leveled characters following around new players and killing them repetitively. right, you're a moron. 
---
You mean you don't want prime pipe rifle plans 
---
What if you wanted to use 2 cards at lower levels...?
---
It's still a 50% damage bonus with those two legendary effects. Which is better than most effects on ranged weapons. 
---
Really? I frequent the Airport for my Stim/event farm. All they drop for me is Hunting Rifles, Pipe pistols and revolvers. For melee they are either just punching the shit out of me or drop pitchforks.
---
I say Flatwoods should be the player hub. It makes the most sense, since it was already that at one point. Just add a secondary quest line that allows us to rebuild the Responders after pushing back the Scorched with the Fire Breathers. 
---
There were 500 vault dwellers, so there’s in-game justification. Of course maybe 476 of them died already...
---
I absolutely love all the rivets on the mothman armor, I just wish we could change the colors and remove the logo
---
Then why doesn't Power Armor give -2 perception? When you get in it shows that the face mask on PA would show something similar
---
190 damage with no perks is nothing? A fucking Fatman with no perks does 150 damage, your two shot combat shotgun should be more powerful than a mini nuke? If you're one shotting everything throughout the game and are mad that's being stripped from you, you're lazy. Players who just want to one shot everything are the modern problem in Bethesda titles. They keep catering to these assholes instead of making challenging titles. 
---
I think we don't know enough info yet and you could be suggesting something already in the works or not practical lol.   Who knows xD
---
Not an event but there's a random encounter where you see 2 gossiping Mr. Handys and if you listen to their conversation for around 30 secs, you get exactly 20 caps. Funny little things.
---
I guess that's a viable strategy. I really like my loadout at the moment so that would be a pain to lose to points to have to move to endurance. 
---
Yeah, when I said it would be permanent I only meant it would be more solid than your regular camp.
---
Perks, mutant heavy combat armor, mutations and luck on items
---
shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
let me take advantage of the stock market crash before people realize!!!
---
lol except we are clearly talking about the PVP dedicated servers in which those players would never log in.
---
100% - people want 400 carrying weight, 1000 stash weight, constant legendary drops, etc. At what point do you just want an "easy" mode?
---
All good I think most of us are not used to getting patch info like this 
---
Really strange. Mine is working fine. Did you use Rad-X may be?
---
Yeah, I'm a low level constantly running out of materials for ammo and repairs because of all the fights but I'd love to have a bit more challenge, especially if they already buffing the loot as well any time soon 
---
I could see it being taken down to 40 or 50 with another nerf like actually using an extra bullet or something. Or, bring it to 40 or 50 and buff everything else. However, there’s no justifiable reason why one effect should significantly and hilariously better than all the rest. Sure there can be trash tier effects like Mutant’s, but having an effect that’s so obviously better than everything else just doesn’t make sense. 
---
Wait what
---
eh as long as it's something that follows the rules of loot generation, only thing it would break is forcing people to trade for everything, which is completely f'd right now as everyone hits the cap cap.
---
when you put the mod on your character uses 5lbs of adhesive screws etc
---
Sure thing?
---
yes you can from treasure hunt maps but its competeliy random it could be anything besides X-01 and ultracite 
---
I actually agree. I enjoy the hell out of this game. I have also never been killed by a TSE bit I also play in passive all the time I have zero interest in pvp. I do not feel they need to be nerfed. They are end game gear now end game has become harder to enjoy. I'm honestly tired of all the crying and bitching. Both here and YouTube. This game has its faults and I do not believe it is worth this amount of bad press. Sadly I feel gamers in general have lost a lot of the spirit that made gaming so great. I don't want to see this game get buried by the avalanche of bullshit from the whiners and bad reviews on YouTube. But if Bethesda kills the great things about this game then it will be dead before to long 
---
I see what you mean. Interesting idea, the details are anyway not us to discuss :p
---
I'm level 90 and I still need some perks for my build.
---
I messed up about 10 points of SPECIAL that I had to change, and I wanted to pick up crafting perks.
---
After level 25 or so I generally only got 2 cards from my perk packs, as I would always get ones I already had.
---
Shouldn't if you are on a team....
---
Cap cap 
---
"new PVP mode" does not necessarily mean "dedicated PVP servers". But yes, if that's what it means, like I said, I'd be on board with that idea.
---
Plenty of perks negate that to a point it may as well not exist a lot don't even know it's a thing
---
I would like to stop spawning in the middle of the river... LOL
---
You are seriously playing the game wrong if you aren’t killing a super mutant in 1 shot with a Instigating rifle
---
Fuck, I can kill a lvl 68 super mutant in ONE head shot with a VANILLA modded .50 refined hunting rifle 
---
WTF are you doing? I’m asking seriously. What are spec’d in?? This sounds horrible 
---
I have an explosive MG42, and even with all the Heavy Gunner perks and Demo Expert it's doing around 70ish damage per shot, not exactly game breaking....but more than enough firepower to take on pretty much everything except Scorchbeasts in just a few bursts; it certainly doesn't require a nerf. I'm pretty pissed off that I built an entire character around said weapon and then they decided to nerf its effect into the ground.
---
After the patch later on this month, any TS/explosive weapons will be nothing more than *slightly* more powerful default guns. Didn't Destiny do a similar thing with their powerful weapons?
---
I mean, it was fun for me. 
---
Treasure hunting.
---
Honestly I feel like behemoth versions of most enemies would be awesome. But I feel we need weak points or critical points like borderlands to offset some of the bullet sponginess. Or a better crippling system 
---
Its not bullshit. 
---
I have maxed agility&amp;luck, Gunslinger, Better Criticals and Critical Savvy. 
---
VATS crit builds are great. 
---
The mod is a zip file. 
---
Me too, because I am.
---
Ive gotten a few pieces, and even more non assassin, sentinel pieces. Its different for everybody, rng is rng.
---
Yep...snowflakes. Instead of just switching to a different weapon, they cry and thinks get nerfed, just like with Bungie. The same happens in real life. 
---
And I've been asking for hardcore servers since like July when the slap system was revealed, I like hardcore survival.  
---
My only prob with Beth right now is the communication, most online games write patch notes that the devs would like to read if they themselves we're players, Beth seems to not want to act like that and act like a separate entity that pieces out information as a Dev not A a player as well 
---
Ah maybe I just sucked at new Vegas then, it was my first fallout game after all regardless. Regardless I wish 76 was crazy hard 
---
You do know they asked people to join the reddit to share their thoughts..
---
"Please share your feedback[ in our forums here](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/314209/feedback-requested-events?language%5B%5D=en) or join our friends at Reddit to let us know what you think. "

"Nedt boss fight"
---
Sorry bud, there are no bosses in this game, and rockets won't hurt the SBQ
---
I'm not saying you are but Jesus Christ you sound like a shill. 
---
Hmm intresting, but I had and have seen a lot of DCs and this is the first time she acted like this.
---
I recently switched to unyielding. Massive bonus to perception and agility. 
---
I used chameleon because it's helpful with sneaking and keeping quiet. 
---
Many of the perks i use are very damage oriented. I have maxed out perception and agility. 
---
Perception perks I use the 3 rifleman, tank killer for armor pen, and concentrated fire for vats head shots. 
---
Agility perks I use Max level sneak, covert ops, evasion, gunfu, sandman, escape artist (primarily to get up close without having to adjust my walking speed. The escape portion is meh).  
---
Luck perks, I use starched Gene's, better critical, vats grim reaper, bloody mess, psychopath (may switch this)
---
Intelligence perk, I use gunsmith lvl 5 for weapon durability since I really only use one or two weapons. 
---
Mutations, I use eagle eyes +4 perception and bird bones +4 agility, and marcupial hehe 
---
I use lever guns, took me about a week to get the plans from Grafton vendor. All my weapons have silencers. 
---
I primarily use TSE lever gun, sad about the complaints now it's getting nerfed hard. It really is the only weapon I've been able to use to down the scorchbeast while they spam their attacks. 
---
My secondary is a zealot lever gun with scorched killer receiver. Trash weapon for anything other than scorched though. I usually can take out a group of mobs with head shots and criticals with added gunfu damage. 
---
I usually start out with a crit shot to the head of a 68 scorched, immediate kill, sometimes my crit meter fills right away, sometimes my AP refills right away, if not, the gunfu gives me added damage to the next head shot and I use vats almost always so the head shot crit attack is imperative to perpetuating the sequences of attacks towards the rest of the group. I can't down a first 68 scorched with a torso shot with the zealot, only head shots work, but after the 3rd enemy gunfu gives me that extra 30% damage I can usually get away with a torso shot.
---
Keep in mind my silenced weapons do 3.5x damage at night so that simplifies mobs. 
---
The reason u switched to unyielding was the massive increase on agility. Even chameleon wouldn't keep me in caution from scorchbeasts. I did a full set of unyielding and usually have a minimum of 29 agility and perception. 
---
I'm still playing with the luck perks seeing which one I like best for vats, but ultimately crit meter has been essential in ensuring my vats does a head shot on the first attack. Because concentrated fire accuracy jumps pretty high after the first attack, a 23% usually jumps to 70% after the crit attack and makes consecutive head shots more reliable for scorchbeasts. 
---
Hope this helps! 
---
Please provide any feedback to help me enhance my sniper character! 
---
I enjoy playing a sniper but have resorted to the melee PA meta just to be able to maintain effectiveness. After the tse Nerf, I'm going to have to figure out some alternatives to my methods most likely. 
---
Thank you.
---
I'd love for the Messenger Events to be much more difficult.
---
Right now, there's one in Cranberry Bog, just south of the Mire... and you start that thing and then you escort the bot all the way down to the antique store; it takes like 9 minutes and most of it is just walking. Not killing many mobs. Just boring-ass walking.
---
If I'm going to do something that boring, I choose to Server Hop for rare plans at vendors instead.
---
I believe the people who constantly shit on the game because they thought it would be filled with NPCs and such, which was told multiple times there are no NPCs. Guess they also expected a story to par with NV, which makes 0 sense considering Bethesda has a hard time with interesting main stories.
---
Yacka to the Yak.
---
Yeah, I could see getting to that..
---
Sure. FR sent. Chef-
---
I never knew bloody mass was a thing.. Thanks for the info! 
---
And i could easily kill those too. Not seeing the problem here and i have a TSE.  
---
I think that they should get a Legendary Mutation after you bring them down to their healing threshold.
---
I don’t think it’s accurate honestly. On PS4 at least I never had a problem with getting attacked by invisible enemies before this last patch and now it happens almost every time.
---
If it is intentional then power armor has basically become useless. 
---
I can't spec into power armor fully AND have a decent amount of damage without an explosive build (which I don't have and don't really want), as well as being able to carry a reasonable amount of stuff on my character. It just isn't possible. 
---
The nerfs they do now are knee jerk panic nerfs due to cheaters screwing up the metrics, and to be frank it's becoming an insurmountable mountain to scale as a player. The game is becoming less and less enjoyable to play as they panic nerf due to one crisis after the other. This is by far the worst I've seen since the early days of mmorpgs. 
---
I never thought I'd see a company be as bad at maintaining it's game as Sony Online Entertainment in Star Wars Galaxies. Especially a company which has access to a highly successful mmorpg developer (Zenimax Online) within it's company envelope. 
---
I've found they are region specific. Like raider is savage divide mostly, ash heap is excavator, and t series is typically cranberry bog. Now they aren't locked there, b7t they are more common to these areas.
---
I haven't been on reddit long, but the "herd mentality" is quite strong in some areas. Lmao. 
---
Marked locations? I know of one person who allegedly got banned who knows tho he hasn’t been on FO76.
---
Thank you for adding nothing to the conversation!
---
That i would like!
---
BUT OP, how will people know that we need more storage space if we don't mention our system of storing an  X amount of every piece of junk that I don't currently need?  Or how will people know that I carry multiple power armor suits if I don't tell them that I want to rename my armor to alleviate my own confusion?
---
its not the all rise - 3 star 90% weight reduction 40% swing speed anti armor though I can see how the similarities of super sledge and reduced weight were confusing
---
that said the 90% weight reduction is supposed to be off the total number not the base weight 
---
Thanks.  You mean scaly skin or others?  Also which perks help the most?  Don’t think I’ll get to 500 but definitely need to beef up my DR
---
Simplest way to describe her: nurse + nuclear holocaust + psycho. 
---
Explosive and two shot are both getting nerfed.
---
Doesn't affect me at all since I don't have either, just saying. 
---
Not me.
---
I hear what you're saying about Vault 76 and that would be really neat.  
---
However.... my suggestion would be to keep the vault hub idea but change it from 76 to another vault.  We have new vaults opening in upcoming content, so why not have one of those vaults be a trade vault?  Maybe with actual NPCs? A Vault Tec capitalism or commerce or economy experiment?  ;p 
---
I haven't done many forest or toxic valley so not 100% sure what's common there just yet.
---
They are just sort of pointless now though.
---
The game is already easy and for me, after nearly 200 hours, boring. 
---
But I got my play worth 
---
Base PS4 here and I still have the floating head every time. Never fully loaded in since last patch. It’s so weird how much everyone varies.
---
Or, the problem is that loading screens take an unnecessary amount of time
---
Which perks?
---
90% weight reduction anti armor and 40% swing speed 
---
That’s a great idea! I’d also love for factions to become more of a role. Like if you’re with the enclave, and you rebuild part of a town, then that town is fitted to suit the enclave. Or any other faction for that matter. 
---
Also, I love the idea of the camp budget and bubble increasing the more you do because that’s a great incentive to actually do the quests
---
I would love to see this as a whole separate game mode honestly. To pull a couple popular ideas from other posts:
---
Log in and choose to play in Co-Op, PVP, or Campaign worlds (maybe have different types of Campaign worldds and this is one of them). 
---
Not be able to port the same character between different types of servers. 
---
In a "rebuild" campaign world, I'm not sure if I would rather see YOUR version of the world slowly being rebuilt as YOU progressed, or the world as a whole progressing with the efforts of the community. If they went with the latter it'd probably have to be a limited-time game mode or a co-op that you can only do with a set team. 
---
A favorite flag would be amazing! PITA sorting though the cards 
---
Myself, I appreciate that Grahm cares about his appearance and changes up his outfit.
---
And barring duping and all that bullshit that went with it, trading is a part of the game. Don't be afraid of the market subs, even if you're scared to buy anything for fear of dupes/dev room items, then at the very least sell your good but unused legendaries, you can be very surprised how much you sell a gun for that would be just 20 caps at the vendor.
---
I would also label repeatedly one shotting people with a two shot explosive weapon even when they have 30% explosive resistant perk and full x01 power armor both griefing and a horribly balanced game to boot.
---
On top of all the same posts (which annoy you), there are people downvoting out of spite (which annoys me). On a post about annoyances, I shared an annoyance.
---
Man, if anything begged for an orbital strike beacon...
---
Hope is alive! Thanks, y'all!
---
Bro thisnis strictly for the new PvP servers
---
I think since the BOS is still a small organized presence in the wasteland, they don't really have access to manufacturing uniforms.
---
That's a fair point. I wasn't trying to overstate my point though, only what I had seen first hand. Still, reason suggests that if a small group of well built players can take on the queen fight in a reasonable manner without TSE weapons, than people of that larger group should be able to as well even with the scaling. So if they are not, is the problem that everyone doesn't have TSE weapons pre nerf (which I have seen trivialize the queen fight down to such a level that everyone doesnt even show up by the time she is dead), or that others are not pulling their weight in what is essentially set up as a raid fight?
---
He was making a day out of systematically smashing people's camps specifically to make them use up valuable mats to repair them.  He specifically targeted my rad cleanser, which was offered up for free as a home amenity for travelers in order to make me use up my flux to repair it.  PC Players should be aware that this guy is an asshole.
---
If he engaged me directly trying to initiate PVP, that's fine.  I think PVP can be amusing in small quantities.  This guy was relentlessly targeting not myself, but my resources.  
---
I was having constant crashes post-patch. I deleted and redownloaded the game and it has been much better — though not completely crash-free. 
---
I take over workshops only when I find them the first time. This has less to do with the materials available there, but for the plans you get for the rewards in capture and defending. 
---
Also...I should say can officially craft ANY power armor. And almost every mod on them. Jets on all t series. Shocks on most. No targeting his yet...but I hope one day lol
---
That is way better than nothing. Thanks!
---
2-master rifleman

---
My explosive radium rifle with +1p takes 2-3 head shots to drop a level 68 super mutant.
---
It sounds like your .50 is the gun that needs to be nerfed and not mine.
---
Thanks, I'm sure if I read the terminal that sells them it explains it clearly and throughly.  I think you can get it cheaper with hard bargain and high chrisma, but they are so expensive and one rad away from being cured on accident, if you forget the starched genes card.  I'm going to try and see how low the price is with my 4 times unyielding armor raising my charisma above 15 and hard bargain.  
---
True, but low health is far more viable than most people realize.
---
Paint me, like one of your french maiden ! 
---
Okay well the difference between what a vendor buys for vs. sells for becomes moot when the objects are "worth" so much more than 200 that they hit their hard cap regardless, like Serums. If you'd ever bought anything over like 800 Caps (or even several items totaling 800) you'd have seen the hard limit instantly.
---
Damn it. This is just down the road from my cap and I go there all the time and never saw the caps or cowboy hat. The locked chest by the guy and his dog also always as a ranger outfit and a few other things for easy caps. There are a ton of drumsticks too which sell for quite a bit. It spawns all different mobs. I've seen fradtoads, molerats, honey beasts, flying insects, radscorpions, and a bunch of others. Truly is a freakshow.
---
Because I actually farm legendaries for an end game and earned that gun?  Check my other posts, specifically my dreams do come true thread.  It's not a TSE, just a one star 2-shot. [https://imgur.com/jtsS4gw](https://imgur.com/jtsS4gw)
---
My house is actually at about 95% budget, after dumping a turret that was doing no real good.  You can check it out here.  [https://imgur.com/ca2GFFf](https://imgur.com/ca2GFFf)
---
World permanence without server permanence is a tricky thing to wrap the brain around. Hoping we as a player base can give some ideas and let Bethesda figure out the technical details because idk if that's something they would have considered as an idea. But they're also pros at this and I'm just a player so maybe they have thought of this and it's already on it's way.
---
So hopefully that helps you out.....knowing they exist and how to get them.
---
No bro id onmy play that mode. And there are 10 of thousands of players that want to PvP.
---
i have the same problem with the "endgame" too. I won't fuck around with scorchbeast queens if i can farm legendaries easier. My ideal endgame would be something like Warframe has. We had Eidolons, big ass creepy shits with more combat stages and unique rewards that you can't get anywhere else. Now we have some big ass spiders too but i didn't fight them yet
---
I agree she's not suppose to be solable, A end game boss should never be, my problem is with low level players who join and make her a complete tank that do not help with dps. So let's say that is the issue. I do not really care for TSE, It was just nice when i could take alot of her health down in a lobby of low level people. My schedule wont allow me to really group up with friends so i have to play with randos 
---
Hey, you are just rude aren't you?  He is not exaggerating, it does take thousands of rounds to kill anything above lvl 50.  Just because some pricks dupe items and stack effects does not mean they are any better.  I'm 100% sure that you take the duping, stacking, and TSE away from cheaters, they'd never be able to survive a run in with me.
---
Dude--thank you so much. This is the kind of shit that really helps. Screenshots FTW--really difficult to describe precise locations w/o them.
---
We get it... you like the nerf...
---
Just to put it out there, grenadier only works with self trowned grenades. It does not work with explosive bullets, grenade launchers, missle launchers or fatmans.
---
Gary: someone who was supposed to be in the vault was killed by me and I secretly took their place. And I am an insane person that believes the nukes never happened and I am trying to prove that they never happened because bats were always that big and so were lizards. 
---
Anger, like Caps Lock, is a choice.
---
Use Grenadier or pacifist? Haha
---
This is s good idea but one if the terminals in the Vault says that a little while after Reclamation Day life support will be turned off inside.
---
This is helpful. Love it.
---
Ok I’ll keep trying thanks
---
"Bethesda does something that angers people"
---
Us: Yes sir, thank you sir, please sir may I have another!
---
I'm trying not to get to excited about Outer Worlds. I'm used to games not living up to my expectations, or letting me down in some way. Still though, hype is still pretty high for that game. 
---
I doubt Bethesda will ever do that, they would loose a considerable portion of their player base.
---
How is this news?  It drained AP (and thereby fusion core) in FO4. 
---
We can only hope.
---
Not that I'm aware of.  I've never willingly engaged in PvP in 76.  This guy was out to ruin my day, so I really didn't care if I was the instigator or not.  I just wanted him gone looking for easier pickings.
---
I am interested in the black powder pistol and Gatling Plasma 
---
And i agree, It is op to one shot low level mobs and screw over people in pvp.. but my issue was with how much the queen turned into a tank during end event. playing solo was 50/50 if you had the server stong enough to take her on. If anything I ask them to not add as much HP to the queen when a low level player joins the event so it still feels like players are doing damage. 
---
Thanks🙏 Kinda tired of explaining the differences compared to other effects which will become more viable now!
---
Why should an engame weapon do +200% dmg only because of 2 legendary effects thats just ridiculous! 
---
You wouldn't need them soon once they're nerfed from 200% to 60% damage
---
Idk if I'm on a team the only way we hurt each other is if someone is wanted....even that is probably broken as well shouldn't be able to team kill in any event.
---
Fair enough, I wasnt there. I sometimes destroy peoples CAMPs for Bounty, but not Rad shower. That's kinda low blow.
---
They do, but most of the time it doesnt even cover the Fast Travel cost to get there.
---
Block you with the intention of hunting you via the use of another player being a spotter? yes that's the sort of bullshit a griefer would do. 
---
Common sense, clearly not so common. 
---
Yea I just had one of those and sold it because it just barely did more than my two shot combat rifle
---
Mission launcher needs a buff
---
It's just for effect, it looks like it has 4 barrels and it even loads 4 barrels but it only actually loads 1 bullet and fires 1 bullet. Terrible design choice and very confusing, loads 4, shoots 1
---
Savage divide level scaling starts at level 15..
---
I'd appreciate it too if it wasn't just a cycle through all the super mutant models :(
---
Went there once for a quest, dipped my balls in honey and went to a bee farm. Every single enemy I found was like 10 lvls above me.
---
It’s still 25% of the damage of the weapon increased and it’s still one of the highest damage dealers 
---
Correct.  Sorry if that wasn't clear.  The 'paint' for the helmet is the mod types you unlock for the base armor.
---
fast travel price is to high when over encumbered 
---
Yeah but the sexual assaultrons will go invisible and get you when your anus isnt ready
---
I've looted multiple 1\* Two Shot Lever Action Rifles in the world. Not a rare weapon. People don't really dupe 1\* weapons. IMO, anybody who uses a Mutant Slayer's Combat Rifle as their main weapon (OP said this), is 99.99999% NOT a duper. Dupers carry 50,000 TSE Handmades. Not a couple 'decent' 1-2\* weapons. 
---
3 ranks in Fireproof and Dense armor mod = invulnerable to TSE weapons.
---
Even shotguns.
---
I always pause when I see a solitary Greenskin on the horizon. Grahm would definitely benefit from some sort of unique identifier in his outfit. Or maybe have him carry around a protest sign re-painted with a poorly spelt "GRHM TREYDR" or something. 
---
2/17: Buffed "TSE" style weapons by 200% despite announced nerf, claiming 'minor error' and estimating 1 month to patch.
---
I forget what its called but if you go north west on the map theres an event where you have to kill 3 packs of dogs, each pack drops a lvl 15-30 legendary. Its what i use on low level characters. Its near a fair grounds. Sorry cant be more discriptive i just woke up lol
---
Yeah, I'd like that.  Same options as the other chat (auto, area, team, none, etc).
---
I can't count the number of trades where I don't know wtf the other person is doing because I can't talk to them.
---
Also please find some way for it to be active IN the trade menu (like voice chat without PTT currently is).
---
I for one enjoy the 600hp restoration from a Quantum
---
Wait... they are going to allow you to swap at will?  LoL more epic fail.
---
Eh... I mean, there is a chance you could find a legendary at 30 that is still viable later, but the chances aren't great, especially if you're not willing to venture into the places with the more rugged enemies. Your best bet is to probably thoroughly explore the Welch region - The mole miners aren't too tough to handle, and some of them drop keys to lockers that'll give you random loot, 300 EXP and sometimes a legendary. You could also try doing random Events, since a Legendary enemy or two will spawn during most of them. 
---
I’ve had experiences like that before but what I’m gonna ask now is if that was recent or if that was 15 levels ago
---
lulz.  CONSPIRACY !!
---
The hunting rifle weighs more than 20 lbs, as op said the missle launcher they are using also weighs 20 lbs. 
---
Yeah I’ve done that a lot. 1 shot with a ski sword
---
Um how do you think the Scorchbeast Queen gets armor or weapons in the first place?  She eats folks.  Do you think she is discriminate in who she eats?  EL OH EL.  She will eat folks wearing wooden armor along with the ones wearing military.
---
Do you think super mutants are going to be picky about armor they wear or are they going to piece together whatever they can find?
---
I could go on and on and on.  The game is fine loot wise.  This game is a cross between a survival game and an ARPG loot grinder.  You don't need to kill the Scorchbeast Queen a few times and have everything BiS.  Stahp.
---
My multiple grenade deaths have told me otherwise. Haha. Pacifist mode seems to of fixed it for us. BUT /u/Caspian83 want to know the merrits of it. You maybe don't need both levels if at all, just  get the guided toss one and it should serve you well.
---
wait..... So you're saying I CAN'T put my masks on, with the orange space suit?! Like I can't do orange space suit + a different helm?! I'm triggered. Was gonna buy it today.
---
Ordinance Express i believe
---
You can reach 3k with melee easy. But right now you can also reach 2k+ with TSE without even using boblehead so I don't feel your reached endgame yet to complain about "high dmg" from melee
---
I would remove the Mole Rats and replace them with Wild Boar or some other native WV wildlife.    
---
The game engine, replace it with unreal engine 4
---
It's a good nerf, though.
---
I regularly find lvl 68 enemies.
---
Wasn't cannibalized myself, but turned around once to find someone exiting power armor. Shortly after, they start munching on the bodies of the Super Mutants I'd just killed. I was only a level 10 and a little sceeved out, so I booked.
---
So.. what would you replace it with?
---
The nerfed tse's. The non nerfed tse's. 
---
One guy can obliterate a whitesprings nuke. He can make it so you get almost no xp and no loot. I remember when people first started nuking white springs and everyone there would huddle together with melees and work together to clear mob spawns. Now one guy just one shots the whole mob through the window then casually loots while everyone else stands there pissed off. 
---
you cheeky bastard i envy you so much 
---
I don’t kill anything that doesn’t attack me or who doesn’t run into my grenade 
---
Good. We don't need 500 threads on this.
---
THATS HOW PEOPLE DIE CLINT
---
Yeah, I checked but nothing.  
---
Similair thing happened again last night.  Body first showed loot but when I moused over and hit Take but  nothing moved into inventory.  After some time it only showed the loot if I opened the Transfer window (wasn't showing when moused over).  I didn't get everything I allegedly looted and when her body poofed no meat pile.  I looked around for awhile because there were other mobs I'd tagged that were Legendary and couldn't find them in the bog terrain.
---
Fair enough
---
I would have taken them, and the box they were in and the cuddly toy next to them. 
---
Carry me too! I wanna be a princess.
---
Gunpowder guns already take forever to load... the added animation to load extra barrels that aren't used just adds even more time to the total reload time... 
---
No. The mod is in the wooden box. A plan for a mod is just paper
---
Besides random legendaries thats the only way in the game ive found low levels
---
Pretty sure durability is directly related to how much damage the weapon does. Less damage means higher durability, so theoretically nerfing it it should ease the problem. 
---
The slow death of 76 has began.
---
It's unbelievable that Bethesda is catering to the Whitesprings farmers and the 10 people who play PvP.
---
Yep
---
&gt;Im pretty sure that is bugged
---
The epitome of FO76
---
Venn diagram of people who bought TSE's and people who don't like the nerf is a circle.
---
Meele isnt strong enough to be good compared to fucking mindless explosive two shoot weapons, so no ! They dont need a nerf -.-,
---
The community manager replied on one of the multitude of Inside the Vault threads (likely the biggest one) and "clarified" a few things, including how the nerfs will work.  Ill toss in a link if OI come across it again.
---
As /u/trixeth pointed out, it doesn’t happen.  As we can say for many, many people — get off reddit and actually play the game.
---
Oh, and for the last part, I can nuke your base into oblivion with a MIRV Fat Man.  Your last sentence has zero bearing on the rest of anything.  Hell, I can eliminate your base with grenades.  
---
I have mixed feelings about the Nerf.   I accept that the TSE are proving an issue.  My wife has a TSE Handmade a guy in the 150+ levels gave her.  It pretty much 2-3 shots anything.  
---
I have a TS Gatling I love.  We're going to feel the loss of that power.   There are some of us, at lower levels, who earned and need those weapons.  But, we'll get by without their current state if needed.
---
Sorry forgot to put that. 
---
Yeah it takes about 10 seconds to reload. It's only good for sneak crits to start a fight because the reload is so long
---
Therein lies the problem with your lack of understanding.  You are thinking about only how you play the game, and how you perceive the game.  Understand that there are players out there who have differing play styles and want different things from this game.  Monster Mash is a "ghost town" because people don't want death match style PvP.  People want world PvP mixed with PvE, where there is no "slap."  I'm not going to debate this with you any longer, as it's obvious that you hold your narrow opinion of this game in such high regard that nothing will change your mind.  You're not open to a wider perspective, and I certainly will not be open to your small-sightedness.
---
That's what I would like to know.
---
&gt; but that the more important question is whether are items that sell for enough to hit that hard cap of 200. 
---
Which is what I was referring to, bro. Chillllllll
---
I'm not for this.  Let caps be the currency method please.
---
I know you want X for your 1,000 shotgun shells, but what happens when 90% of the players don't have X?  Your post stays up, and you don't get what you want.
---
Instead, sell those 1,000 shotgun shells for 1,000 caps.  Then use those caps to buy X.
---
That's the entire reason we moved from a barter economy to a money based economy in real life.  I don't want to get paid in chickens for working, then find someone who accepts chickens in payment for gas so I can get home.  Pay me in caps, and I'll go buy gas for caps.
---
That's it I couldn't remember off the top of my head
---
You no kill, he no kill.
---
Oof I know... I moved some points from strength. Just had to do it. My armour isn't tight enough yet to ignore limb damage/ 
---
But tbh i would worry more about grinding levels than getting legendaries because even if you get a good one, very soon it will be useless. Omce you get to 40-50 your set 
---
I had the same issues as LastJedi, I'd put the "shower" pass-wall connector in a wall, and it would end up upstairs. Last night I wasted a lot of copper and nearly starved my character trying to make conduits work inside the house. It frustrates me because they *LOOK* so much cleaner than bare wires and I *WANT* them to work.
---
We wants-s it! My p-p-precious-s-s!
---
What really annoyed me is that I couldn't simply snap two long sections of conduit together, I had to use a junction. But that does give me an idea of what to use tonight. I could put a junction in first, then try to snap the pass-wall conduit to it.
---
I also tried the Conduit Radiator, but it seems to only have a range of one floor tile.
---
&lt;Curmudgeon&gt; And another thing!&lt;/Curmudgeon&gt; Why are they on the floor? I'm using the floor! Put them on the walls or ceilings like I do in Real-Life^((tm)) !
---
There is a perk in strength that no longer drains fusion cores while springing in PA
---
You obviously missed the disclaimer on the wooden box. 
---
*some assembly and additional materials required
---
Nah it wont. Now that they nerfed tse into the ground anyone wanting to do decent end game damage will be forced to run a bloodied build now which completely goes against them saying they want us to be able to play anyway we like.
---
Cheeky way they could do this is turn it into a minigame. Where your SPECIALS are glass vials, and your cards are water. And you can only fill the vials to the top. But cards are auto-maxed. Like being given a 3 gallon jug and a 5 gallon jug, and you want to end up with exactly 4 gallons in a 5 gallon jug. It's doable, but not easy to do on the fly, which would also help with the issue that currently you can too easily situationally swap cards and be good at everything (no need for dedicated crafters, which hurts player economy). 
---
Another way would be to let us slot any card, and pick if you want it active as 1-5 stars on insertion. By default, make it go in full-force, but if we need to reduce it, let us do so manually. Basically how the perk calculator at NukesDragons.com does this. They could also link this system with the respec system, so that we pay X caps (or Atoms), all SPECIALS unlock, we stuff in cards as we see fit, including control over how many stars are active, and then "bake" it and SPECIALS settle for optimal layout.
---
Why do I suddenly hear a protectron voice saying "*weeeEEEE*"
---
We should get a chance to permanently move our current toon over. (For a limited time, 3 to 4 weeks after launch)
---
Otherwise its gonna be a joke. People will jump into pvp empty pockets. It will just be fortnite. I want RISK, REWARD, FEAR, ANXIETY. 
---
Calling it now: PVP servers will not show the location of every player on the map. 
---
Honestly they should have left 2 shot alone. The explosive part of 2se was always the problem with balance. 
---
Well it's supposed to represent using your pip-boy's real time calculations to project the chances of landing a hit on an enemy (or a specific enemy part) so I guess outside of PA it might just be your character's draining AP with feverish calculations and intent focus on landing a shot? It's a weird thing to think about. 
---
A 75% nerf to TWO legendary prefixes seems a tad overkill. Why not actually fix the eternal bobblehead glitch instead, since that's what is ACTUALLY causing the ridiculous damage output people are complaining about? "But it's easier to nerf the meta into the ground, so let's do that." - lazy devs
---
I've been upvoting most every downvote  for giggles and shit
---
Agree with other posters here that legendaries you earn at level 30 won't be much use later.  Follow the quest lines and you'll get some really useful materials at your level, and you'll level, too, making you able to farm higher.
---
The game scales pretty well for people who follow the plotlines.
---
How do you scrap fertilizer? I’ve tried at the workstation and smelting but no go. 
---
Pistol builds seem sort of depend on speed. So I guess the tactic would be; grenade, run in screaming and shooting, stab all the bad guys.
---
I'm indifferent. I'll wait for the patch then make my opinion.
---
Agreed! The game lacks challenging enemies. Even SBQ can’t kill a player, and all she does is being huge bullet sponge.
---
I wish there were more types of enemies, aside from Diseased, like Electrified, Radioactive, Armor piercing, Explosive - much like Diablo 3 handles rare mobs.
---
I dream of actually dying from hard monster fights.
---
Now that i have full set of Sentinel armor dying is even more rare thing.
---
What's the Sultry Argonian Bard verson?   The Sultry Protectron Bard?  
---
Has any one tested if it actually grants those or not by going to the Ash Heap?
---
Count yourself lucky. Me and my 2 roommates always get attacked in the black screen if there are enemies near us when we spawn in. Since launch we've had those issues. 3 min load screen, 25 sec blackscreen where we get attacked then 30 second load time as floating head waiting for the world to load. 
---
Ts won’t even be a thing anymore they’re taking the roll out of the game 
---
Same thing here. Very stupid it doesn't work for it.
---
Issue with this is you know someine will make a new account, have their level 100 plus friends join on them, they leave and change to their high level account and they join their friends in the low level server
---
Don't bother. Just level up and farm after 50.
---
The implication being that neither Salisbury steaks nor canned dog food are actually meat. 
---
I know.
---
I switch to melee when I play with others and run circles around legendaries until everyone gets a shot in.
---
I quit farming Whitesprings and went back to wandering the wasteland. Whitesprings drops are all garbage anyways and it's not even fun. Whitesprings farming is a degenerate gambling addiction.
---
Also: why can’t the vendors have more than 200 caps? Shit is whack
---
This is the kind of content I like to see. 
---
Oh actually grenades....hmm idk if they hurt us tbh....probably a glitch. But that's not possible in this uber polished AAA title.....you prolly lyin 
---
A level five two shot (not ultracite) laser literally did that. Glad I sold it.
---
Haha really is there such text
---
Why not tote the **Broadsider** around for authenticity?
---
That's why I'm saying it again dude, because you said my point doesn't mean anything, but then you turn around and make the exact same point. You're saying I'm wrong and then reiterating the same thing I just said.
---
No, not a bad day in the Wasteland, a shitty morning on Reddit haha Im complaining more about the Reddiquette on this sub than i am the game. 
---
On that note, yes i agree, vendor cap limits are obscene. I dont understand how i can possess an item thats worth more than they could ever pay me (Twisted Muscles Serum - 470)
---
Yet there are people on here who will tell you, "Everyone's got TSE."
---
That knowledge was my one goal with this post. Thank you again!
---
Of course. Just gotta squint real hard.
---
You're welcome 👍🏻
---
There's no bugs...just features! heh
---
Check if VoIP settings in game are set to team, not area.
---
Epic. Agreed.
---
A pirate would be black powder only. 
---
Leather leg would still be to good.  Make it a wooden one 
---
THANK YOU! Thank you for hearing the words im actually trying to express rather than attacking me for how i choose to express it. What you said is exactly how i feel, and exactly why i shared the post like i did. 
---
Like i said, i dont have a TSE, but am i suppose to look forward to one now? Not so much.
---
Quad Explosive Harpoon and Bloody Explosive Shotgun will still be incredible because each pellet does full weapon explosive dmg. The other ranged, not so much.
---
Wait till you kill one that is carrying a baby sloth😥
---

---
My best drops in game have been from awol armaments. Them colonel gutsys are very kind to me. 
---
RNGesus loves me, this I know.
---
For my loot drops tell me so!
---
Just carry a brace of pistols? haha
---
I’m at Honda, and just laughed so hard everyone’s looking at me :/
---
Take a suit of T45 armor and do the Uranium Fever event at Blackwater Mine when it appears. The Molemen who you'll fight are level-capped at 40 and there's a guaranteed spawn of at least three 3-star Legendary miners who drop items in the 30-40 level range. The mine is just across the tracks from Whitesprings, to the east.
---
Next time, for sure
---
Not true, they edited their post to further elaborate what they meant. Read the updated Inside The Vault.
---
It’s amazing no doubt. Definitely top tier 
---
Slot machines are the best idea I've heard in a while!! It would be a use (finally) for pre war money other than just making cloth; and the slot machines could give out a superglue or something now and then. Not enough to have people on them 24/7 but just like in Borderlands 2 where you have a slight chance of getting something decent now and then. 
---
#GOOD IDEA HERE BETHESDA
---
Yes, some of them are, but not all of them.  Purpose of this post is to hopefully get people in game to spread more word with people they meet so we get less false reports.  
---
As a TSE user I think it’s a fine thing to nerf just the values we’re too extreme...maybe 50% dmg to explosive is enough?
---
I dunno about you but a Furious exploding/anti-armor minigun would probably be powerful
---
Oh that new hat on the atom shop!
---
\^this, ,those weapons are crap compared to everything else. 
---
It will still do A LOT more damage than most other TSEs. So will shotguns.
---
Is this a joke?
---
They should make it 7600 hours played.  In a *single* year.  And the reward is a lifetime supply of redbull and 10mil Atoms.  If you live.  Seriously i don't think it's meant to be a dare.  Have fun playing that much.
---
Sweet tune.  I know it's gonna ear-worm me from now on when I'm crossing fingers for a drop.
---
Lol, when the nerf was announced there were 20 posts a minute popping up about it. How much unique discussion is really happening there?
---
Im sitting on a stack of 5k cells with the hopes they do something to energy guns. 
---
lol I love this!
---
Lol is there any advantages to a 2nd guy?
---
Events everywhere pull from various loot pools. Forest loot pools sucks flat out. Every other pool includes plans for things like power armor and mods, elite armor mods (not from scrapping), and elite weapon mods. The odds aren't high enough for my tastes, but I consider them to have great rewards when hell freezes over and you get a good one. I've been trying for weeks to get more t-51/t-60 plans.
---
Excellent point on the Enclave commendations. Why would their vendors accept caps? Makes no sense. Elite soldiers gaining access tic top-tier equipment, however, seems much more plausible. Maybe buff those Enclave plasma weapons too, so they are actually something to strive for, as opposed to a re-skinned version of the normal ones. 
---
Yeah like 1 blunderbuss and then 5-6 pistols.
---
Nice I had no idea it stacked
---
If the killer spending his time to search you up on otherside of map to kill you again, yes that is griefing. But when I take his workshop, kill him and now he comes back and I kill him again and he still comes back and I kill again, how ever I can in laws of the game, that that is not griefing. That is you being stupid and getting killed.
---
In this game we eat booty
---
See the thing is it's now on par with the other legendary effects so it's called balanced, it's possible now ranged guns could see a sweeping dmg buff but that wouldn't of been possible without tse in it's pre Nerf state for balance reasons so honestly I like this change. People may need to learn to use stealth or vats crits now to keep oneahotting everything but that's like saying "they will need to play the game to do  amazing damage now" so you won't hear a complaint from me
---
Or a very very stained vault-suit with the number 001 one the back
---
nope
---
funny you bring this up....yesterday i was literally looking at weigh reduction perk cards in conjunction with my armor pieces and their food/ammo/armor reduction stats......i didn't have time to do take notes, but it was definitely "not right".. and the order at which i equipped them made a difference (perk card then armor piece, and vice versa)
---
You have to have the perk and level of perk required to build it.
---
Hubby and I had weird hard crash to desktops while playing last night.  We were exploring Mount Blair and lag started increasing and then sudden crash to desktop.  It happened to me three more times over the next half an hour in the area. One of those times I did have a very weird blue loading screen and then crashed out five minutes after getting into the world.
---
Pistols would still be bad with this, mind you. Lower base damage and low clip size = lower dps.
---
Auto? 
---
WG isn't just physical weight of an object, but also the space/bulk of the object it's self, so a mod that makes your gun take up more space would make sense as increasing more weight, than the components of that mod before it was installed would
---
I’ve only gotten two plans for actual power armor pieces (one t51 arm and one t60 arm) but dropped for completeing distant thunder. Hope this helps, good luck
---
Not me, I sold mine for 500 caps.
---
250?! I thought people were doing 1-4k damage. My 2* power fist does 235 DMG. Love it. Power Attacks do double damage. (Obviously have all the perk cards I need to Max melee dps etc..)
---
No Instigating and Two Shot are both Prefix modifiers
---
[Legendary Effects](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects)
---
[I've identified your issue](https://imgur.com/XY6f9bC.png)
---
Your position makes no sense. Obviously the people with more game time will have better gear and thus be more likely to win. That’s kind of the whole idea... if you want your PVP to be 100% skill-based, you’re looking in the wrong place. 
---
&gt; [...] holding everyone else down by killing all other players on sight. 
---
Why do you assume this is true? 
---
I’m sure the new mode will have different mechanics than currently exist, but say it doesn’t, you could block the hoatile player and fast travel away. 
---
Or they could just gate certain areas by level range. 
---
Yours is an odd position to take. 
---
It's quite possible that once you loaded into location with missing items they won't get reset until another account enters the area, resetting it in the process (similar how they respawn the enemies). I could be very wrong about this though.
---
Scorchbeasts with a new endgame.
---
I'm a melee/pistol build, but furious/anti armor have always been solid perks on my eyes. My looking for a pistol with anti armor/furious and explosive. Since pistols have no perk cards for ignoring armor. 
---
Minute. It’s nothing basically.
---
Sorry what do you mean by this? Like if it says 800 dmg it actually does...3k? Asking for harpoon :)
---
A shameful lack of Fisto up in this list.
---
Yar, me crew be a bit thin at the time being... Always lookin fer new hands to help pillage the rolling green waves of West Virginia!
---
So then it’s probly not worth the investment. Wasn’t sure thank you for clarifying that
---
Not to mention those mods should only weigh a pound each, max
---
The nerf is just pure shit. The simplest most balanced way to fix the damn TSE problem is to make explosive a primary prefix. No two Shot and explosive on the same weapon. 
---
New Meta will be the Original Meta!—————-&gt; Two Handed Melee Build Plus Grognaks magazines X  Strength Bobbleheads Stacked to the Duped power. 
---
Ah yes, flechette on the harpoon, nice. But that's the next nerf, multiple projectile weapons. Then bloody gets nerfed. Nerfs are always easier than actual balance fixes, and this community has given the stupidest endorsement of nerfs now, so it's just gonna keep coming. 
---
I've done the wanted method but I to prefer the workshop one.  You catch many people off guard who never store their junk or were in the middle of something at their camp.  Only reason I have my jetpack is because a person I killed happened to have a bunch of stable flux on him.  Just yesterday even I caught a group of 3 doing Uranium Fever.  They were at the workbench in the mines scapping or whatever and one explosive shotgun shot sent all 3 of them rag-dolling into the walls XD.  Quick 500 cap payout between them all.
---
Reall looking forward to the full patch notes later this month!! 
---
they only told us about the tse nerf and a new pvp mode so far :)
---
Feedback RE: events  
---
\*Powering Up Poseidon  
---
Its a good event with a good time frame for completion as it is difficult your first time. Not rewarding enough for high level characters as they normally have generator plans. offering weapon/armour part plans after all three generators are unlocked would encourage more well off characters to interact with those of lower levels and help them out.  
---
\*Feed the people.  
---
Fix the bug where it eats your items. Please.  
---
\*Horde events   
---
I avoid like these like the plague... too many quest markers too far apart   
---
\* that fertilizer event in toxic valley (the name escapes me)  
---
 The enemies are too strong... high level players dont go there. should be 20-35 not 45-60.  
---
\*\*\* I APPROVE OF THIS CHILDS PLAY WEEKLY EVENT! INTERESTING CONCEPT! EFFECTIVE BONUS!  
---
 Hope to see more like this, hope my feedback was useful.
---
Pretty sure I have all the power armor crafting perks required. I have power Smith 3 power patcher 2 and fix it good 2. Is there another perk I need I didn't see any perk restrictions in craft menu
---
Is there a way to get a Bone Hammer consistently? I only rarely see them on raider vendors.
---
Yea, doesnt mean each and everyone one of you have to make a separate post about the same thing. Single threads, people.
---
I enjoy the feedback, im here to read the feedback. I am not here to see the same topic be a part of 7 consecutive top posts!
---
In reality ya, that saying might be true, but in a video game the items have a fixed value that then gets used as the base upon which the vendor formulas for price get used. So ya, it does have an intrinsic value, not just one based on people's willingness to buy.
---
And you literally said my point didn't "mean anything", that's about as close to "you're wrong" as possible dude. Incredibly dismissive. But okay, no hard feelings, just a misunderstanding.
---
I couldn't skip the cut scenes fast enough in fo4... I love grind this ones all grind I like it alot 
---
Admantium skeleton can keep you from flinching I'm pretty sure
---
What system are you on? Haven’t crashed since the dec patch. No real FPS issues either.
---
&gt;Okay so the problem isn't there not being a stash box, it's being lazy to walk upstairs.
---
I go to the bunker to sell crap and check for plans. I decide I want to stash 6 some stuff. I have 2 options:
---
Walk through the bunker to the hotel exit, sit through a loading screen, navigate through the hotel to Artisans Corner, and stay my crap.
---
Or, I bring up the map, fast travel to the train station for 1 cap, and stash my stuff there.
---
It's not laziness, it's efficiency. 
---
Like picking up a 25lb weight and it weighing 12lbs in my inventory. 
---
Seriously, I can fly from Atlanta to Las Vegas on a Tuesday for 6145 points.  7600 hours is wishful thinking.
---
What kills me is they do this nerf for the regular two shot legendarys, like on the Assault Rifle it makes a solid replacement for the lever action but still isn’t op took on the SB Queen the other morning with like 7 or 8 other ppl on the server my two shot assault rifle wasn’t even making a mark on it. 
---
Very true lol
---
190 is not one shotting anything over lvl 30. Ive never one shotted anything over 40. Where are you getting your info? Im a solo player that little bit of extra damage makes the game less of a grind for me. At lvl 90 I should do significant dmg at this point because im fighting lvl 50 and up enemies. 3 to 4 shots up close with a reg shotgun should kill a super mutant but it takes way more. I finally got to a good point where I can do that and feel comfortable, but now they nerf it. Sorry for me its a fucking buzz kill. Ill give it a go again after the next update for now my motivation is dead and it suck because I genuinely enjoy the game. 
---
this also happens on ps4
---
The more aggravating bug is when trying to place it, it actually appears on the floor above. Through wall conduits do this too, as does the Decon arch. 
---
They're not that bad, time consuming yeah, but unless you're overencumbered you can just snipe away. Unless it's like wendingos, I hate those pricks and am thinking of going shotgun limb crusher just for them. All the super mutants etc. are fairly easy to isolate and snipe away at 1 by 1. I don't have any melee perks but with a super sledge had no problems disposing of the melee attackers at lvl 25 or so. 
---
Original xbox one
---
Totally agree here. Could you imagine if the Golden Gun got nerfed in GodlenEye 007 or the blue shell for Mario Kart? Gamers used to have to strategize for things like Swords in Halo and Noobtubes. I think its great the companies listen to the community, but there are some things that we just need to get better at dealing with. Find a way to make mechanics work in your favor instead of reworking mechanics. Ya know?
---
Ahh, gotcha! I appreciate the contribution and understanding.
---
No I am not.
---
My early drops led my character into a non automatic rifle build and I have a life so I can't sit at Whitesprings grinding XP 24 hours a day so switching perks is not a great option for me.
---
No I don't have a suppressor..... it's a radium rifle and mods are very hard to come by, I've spent the last week traveling the map from vendor to vendor enjoying the RPG aspect of playing with what I've got while the degenerates play their slot machine golf club crap.
---
There is nothing wrong with my gun, sure it's not a sniper with a suppressor, but when mutants bum rush me it can drop them........of course that is about to be nerfed and it is going to be a shit gun.
---
Sounds like a good idea. Too bad we get janky looking skins like the toy paint.
---
This is an example of people finding things to bitch about in regards to 76. The same thing occurred in Fallout 4 and there wasn't a peep about it.
---
I like the game but I admit, it's got problems. This isn't one of them, focus on the real criticisms.
---
3 star Bloody. Full unyielding set. Alchohol perks. Mutations. Nerd rage. Radicool. Bloody mess.  Its pretty easy. Incisor is huge and you must use it.
---
40+ strength baby.  💪
---
Without bloodyd/unyielding your gonna max out at maybe 600 dmg IF you can even get it that high (sledge)
---
Meanwhile, i can do 4k with my bloody. Im doing around 1500 at 60% health.
---
I feel like this is coming. At least I have hope it is. I don't think they put it in because maybe they though perk swapping wouldn't be plausible since more than likely it would need a different SPECIAL distribution. However, not only is there a QoL load out benefit, but some builds have very similar SPECIAL bases (like melee and Heavy Gunner).  Last time I saw a response on this it was "Our team is very much aware of this."
---
The only change I really want is more items to carry ballistic fiber. And bug fixes of course.
---
I would really just love a little more oomf for my Western revolvers, you know? Wanna feel like a cowboy! Big iron on his hiiiiiiiip! 
---
Chef- fr sent
---
Great. I'm level 45.
---
I’d kind of like to if there were no legendaries what so ever in PVP mode. It’d make it completely different and I wouldn’t rely on my OP guns anymore, I’d have to think cleverly and stuff.
---
How's so?
---
honestly if the loading screen made a difference in performance whatsoever i would rather it be longer.
---
There are disconnects every now and then (like before) for me it was rare before the patch, in areas (robots spawn at whitesprings) there are the same freeze issues.  I've had a couple actual game freezes (no disconnect) since patch, I don't recall having them before patch as well.
---
I understand the logic that you’re coming from but you gotta understand how drastically that would split up the player base, the more options you add the more chances the computer has to say “don’t match with this person,” 24 player worlds would shrink to a walking simulator, or in 76’s case, a “skipping” simulator
---
Correct, Mine is nearly 23lbs in it's current configuration.
---
Sentinel would be best for ranged, while cavalier would be best for melee
---
75% dmg nerf for TSE they calculate. That's pretty big. Should have been 60% but whatever. As long as multi-shot weapons, melee, and bloody is nerfed next.
---
No PC game from the time of x386 IBM compatible computers to date has not had issues, especially them SoundBlaster drivers, Direct X and glitches etc.   
---
 Then, like now, there are forums, like this, where constructive discussions between developers and players can meet to fix issues. Patches, official or not are created and some games survive, and some die. 
---
Original gaming youtube channels were an alternative to Gamefaq and similar “walkthrough” websites for gaming solutions. They added to the community.
---
YongYea and new toxic youtubers, simply read these gaming forums, call it “research”, and negative issues are sensationalised for clicks. But they give nothing back to the gaming community. 
---
Oh check my post history in here.
---
You'll see I'm on the same page as you.
---
My only point of this thread was calling out people crying to nerf everything because TSE got nerfed.
---
I'm not a fan of the TSE nerf either. I think they should have started w boblehead stacking and went from there.

Normally I wouldn't use this feature, but I love the fact that you can make your own loading screens.  I also wish I was better at capturing the moment.  Nice pics!
---
I think you can get it from treasure maps.
---
It’s simple really, you add in enemies with moderate health that reflects back any over flow damage, then mix em in with the standard enemies so no one can tell the difference and the problem will sort itself out in the end. Of course there would be lot of people here whining how they suddenly died while killing ghouls at whitespings but as long as Bethesda ignores there cries, people will get the message and adapt. 
---
Good story, thanks for sharing!
---
It’d actually be pretty cool if it didn’t steal kills
---
When I think of Vending machines ran by players I think of this:
---
* TSE Handmade 200
---
* TSE Mingun 300
---
* TSE 50. Cal 500
---
* Aid 1 Cap
---
* Ammo 1 Cap
---
Thats just a simple example.
---
Yea man, it was a joke👍 Hence why I instantly went back on it.
---
Literally, 3 paragraphs of regular typing, AND YOU CHOOSE TO COMMENT ON THE SENTENCE LIKE THIS??
---
Stupidity, like irrelevant comments, is a choice.
---
Yeah, ESO is more challenging, but that's also due to the fighting mechanic which is almost turn based. The reason fo76 is too easy sometimes is because I can snipe an enemy from x distance and kill them before they reach me. You can also just jump on something and only enemies with projectile attacks can hurt you. 
---
No, Bethesda is not aware of these issues and you're literally the first person to bring them up. 
---
The marine tactical helmet has been in the game from the outset. 
---
Bethesda support told me that my GTX 1080 and i7 4770k was under powered for this game and did not meet Minimum specs.  Game runs smooth at max settings but was crashing on the SB Queen Spam.
---
I can make the marine tactical helmet, and yhe marine wetsuit. But I don't have extra plans.
---
„I dropped or scrapped my favorite item by accident, can you please fix this bug Bethesda!“ 
---
Ight inv me
---
Looks great, I have not seen that Nuka-Cola Quantum sign before. Is that an unlockable/purchase-able plan or built on an existing structure?
---
Bro, bro, it’s NOT a shit gun lol. Its a good gun. You just gotta get it right ya know?
---
Are you on XB1? I can mod a suppressor on it for you and help you with your build. 
---
A buddy of mine would love this. He used to exploit so much crap in Borderlands2 it was no longer fun and I gave up playing. He didn't want any of the challenge, he wanted to down the major bosses in 5 seconds and had fun doing it.
---
Is this still bugged? I'd love to add talons to my build without having to re-farm everything! (I have carnivore active). 
---
Sorry for my wording. I meant "didn't mean anything" in the sense of "that metric isn't the one I'm talking about" since I was talking specifically about what it's "worth" to the vendor (meaning what it will pay for the thing) 
---
KBB can say my car is worth 10k all day long but if my only option to sell it is back to the dealer for 5k then guess what? That car is worth 5k, lol. That's all I meant. That 10k "doesn't mean anything" because it's not like I'm going to get that from the vendor.
---
Strong reference 
---
hes immune to damage so you cant really kill him so it doest really matter. 
---
It won’t be your caps they’re after nitwit
---
Plot twist:
---
The final boss' death wish is for you to spare him (possibly on an options screen (KILL-▲-SPARE) like older Fallout) for the unknown chance to obtain a key to a secret door behind which is another secret section of the lab which holds bleeding edge pre-war technology and a few clues, which all point to evidence of some sort of alien intervention all of which will serve as a breadcrumb for a DLC similar to Mothership Zeta from FO3. 
---
Only if you spare him will he surrender his master key; choose to kill him and a Predator-esque endgame sequence is triggered. The nuclear sirens and emergency broadcast flicker up on your screen as it is revealed that he has in fact got remote access to the silos and has triggered a nuclear launch on the position of the lab. Demonic eyes yellow and sagging he stares triumphantly at you from his pool of green glowing blood as he produces a terrible, terrifying sound. He starts laughing, somewhere between a distorted guttural human/ghoul and a scorchbeast's shriek echoing around the chamber as the quest changes for you to escape the room as he blows up the lab, blocking it off for that run but leaving a small hole in a wall just big enough to give an enticing peak at the weaponry. Your quest reward is high level loot that he would have given you anyway had you spared him, plus 100-200 caps and a new plan for a new science related camp item.
---
No it works as intended now
---
Yes! 
---
I literally can't bring myself to harm the sloths, or foxes in game. It breaks my heart lol.
---
I have farmed for hundreds of hours and have legitimately obtained: 3* TSE Gatling, .50 cal, pump shotty, combat shotty. I probably got very lucky. Good to know that time was well-spent and that other decent weapons I got rid of along the way weren't wasted.
---
Wait, so it IS fixed or not? I have carnivore. Can I go buy a serum now and have it applied to my build? 
---
Never heard of it
---
Yes it is a quest reward for for a certain faction
---
Yes, but with construction protectrons being a thing that's not to far fetched, there's a back pack style tool with a vibrowand thing on the end specifically for shaking poured cement for things like porch steps to make it fit in the mold properly.
---
just google cement vibrator and you'll see what I'm talking about
---
148 DMG for 0.08 weight...I would take that! The one rolling pin I'd keep lol
---
This would be cool because then we'd have a faction as vault dweller.
---
Not really. The thing sucking the life out of this game are the Bethesda Fun Police nerfing everything and just all around making it even more tedious. I rushed to hit level 100 when I found out about the Whitesprings nerf. That last achievement was the last thing I needed to do, I already felt like I accomplished all there was to accomplish before that.  I had wanted to start another character just to play around with a different build and roleplay as a medic, but I doubt I'll do that now. 
---
All that elbow grease you added has got to weigh something
---
This was my main argument too. 100% agree. I just got dismissed though and told to “git gud”  
---
Oh my goodness... that's exciting. I hope you're correct sir) be bummed if I'm down 4k lmao 
---
Have you ever experienced having an input that is multiple sizes larger than your output? The poor brahmin can sometimes get a little baked up. Thankfully my brahmin are all mathematicians, so they work their problems out with a pencil. 
---
Not ultracite power armor like regular armor combat armor
---
PS4 here, it's not so easy? I could be wrong. There have been times I'd dearly love to switch characters and put a hurt on some high level douchebag tormenting my level 15 for simply existing.
---
Oooo sweet. So, what materials do I need for that? 
---
I have seen multiple reports it is fixed and I myself used multiple serums with Carnivore with no downsides. The bug is fixed.
---
Ew, don't call me a nitwit ugly cunt. I'm being optimistic and naive. Leave me be 
---
Yes tse is op but it can only be on under powered weapons. My TSE handmade still does less damage than a super sledge without legandary affects. This nerf should come with a buff to ranged combat as a whole
---
My dude! I'm hyped 
---
Equip whatever pieces you have and spam the enclave events. I put together a full set in like 2or 3 hours.
---
I am ok with the nerf, but the elephant in the room is the stacking of explosive bobbleheads.  Fix the duping, wipe bobbleheads and then make weapon adjustments.  Why would they focus on PVP first?  Maybe that depends on what they plan on releasing next, content wise.
---
Stabilized = heavy guns
---
Long shot = rifles
---
Crack shot = pistols
---
Skeet shooter = shotguns
---
Groundpounder = auto rifles
---
Modern renegade = pistols again
---
Concentrated fire = every single weapon type
---
There ya go I may of missed one or two but there is literally an accuracy perk for every weapon before you even mod it all of which will negate the "negative" of twoshot mind showing me a single other legendary that can be negated so easy?
---
 Bloodied you have to be on death's door(5% of your max hp) to do 5% less dmg than twoshot does AT ALL TIMES.
---
Junkies can do the same dmg as twoshot ATM if you don't mind being addicted to 12 or 13 different chems all having nice effects like -100 dmg resist, -10% dmg, -4 to EVERY SINGLE one of your special stats, items from vendors cost more. 
---
Biggest mistake an online game can make
---
Attempting to balance PvP and PvE in a game with bosses.
---
You cant make a good or fun boss if its forced to have the hp of a player and you cant make players or npcs a fun fight because your trying to make everyone even across the board.
---
Pvp and pve need to be seperate in a game with different calculations for each for it to work.
---
Nerf guns then you have to nerf bosses then you have yo go back and buff/nerf the guns again in an endless cycle.
---
I'm on Xbox, tried reinstalling, didn't work. Just as bad as before with DCs and crashes. 
---
Exactly! If the Nuclear ingredients don't sterilize the contaminants, then the Cleaner will make it clean and safe to drink!
---
lol. he does. but he's probably genuine. i'm level 63 and feel the same way. i even convinced my brother to buy the game to play this weekend.  
---
Sorry man some people do actually just really like the game :D
---
So this is why someone fast travelled to me and was hostile to me the other day. I was even in pacifist mode and no where near the workshop I took over for a challenge.
---
Honestly, while I dislike the nerf to two shot and would love the explosive nerf. I think many aren't taking into account how the multiplative factor works with TSE. Base Damage x Perk multipliers + Weapon modifiers + Mod x 2 = modified damage as I understand it. And each multiplier is applied in such a way that TSE or TS could in effect be a used abusively with proper conditions.  I do agree that Bethesda is treating a symptom rather then disease  but that's just a part of fixing the issue.
---
my bad, but no, thats not a thing.
---
Doesent President Eden mention he used to be an ai in charge of everyth
---
Did they change how explosive damage works on shotguns? If it still adds base damage per pellet, I feel like it’ll still be a bit too powerful. 
---
But time will tell, I guess.
---
Most people in 76, like 99%, will at least return a hello wave.  I deeply appreciate the sentiment when anyone tries to leave me something nice, be it pearl grip revolver plans or a few pieces of ammo or scrap.  I may not be able to use it myself, but I'll pass it along to someone else.  I'm trying to offer my experience to build a better wasteland and most people are, too.  I'm just glad that I'm a min/maxer with good gear and the ability to put a quick beating on someone that sees my bed and breakfast as easy pickings or a non-power armor build as weak.
---
My first MMO was Dungeons and Dragons Online which I played from 2011 to 2015 until Fo4 came out.  DDO  is punishingly hard if you want to pursue top end elite gear.  It taught me how to build ridiculous characters that I'd never play in a tabletop game with friends.
---
what a guy...
---
I've been having this same exact experience, but on Xbox. 
---
I'm on RN, I don't need anything, but I can give you 2k .45 for free. EODlicious, just FR me
---
FEATURE! 
---
They're only there for me one out of four times when I log on (Charleston FD maybe one out of ten). Often, if they are there, it's an incomplete set of them. Someone takes the ones near the back wall, but misses the set by the doorway itself. Everyone knows about these locations, and at lower levels, it's the absolute easiest set to grab. Sometimes I'll just do something else for a couple of hours and they'll spawn back in.
---
Last night had a queen run where we killed her after 45 minutes. I broke 2 explosive shotguns and a BSS sledgehammer on her. Honestly should have called it quits way earlier when I looked around and it was mostly level 40s and only 3 people over lvl 100 including me haha. The queen is hit and miss, sometimes she's difficult. There were more than a dozen people there, nobody hiding in the shed 
---
I used exploits in bl2 but only on my "fun" characters (I.e. Characters that I've gotten to op8 legitimately and beat all the raid bosses solo, and I'd only use the exploits to see how ridiculously op I can get the characters. I didn't use things like gibbed and "broken weapons" that you'd have to use 3rd party software or saves to get though, only ingame ones. 
---
Not a bad idea. At least you can't agro him can you?
---
I lit him up at one point and I don't think he gave a damn. Granted, he was in the process of killing some ghouls, but ya.
---
I agree the problem for me is that it affects weapons that are not TSE as well. All my regular two shots will be much weaker. It affects PVE more than PVP and its unfair to people whom legitimately found these legendary weapons. Thanks for posting!
---
Ah okay. I read it but I didn’t know they changed it 
---
These are cool ideas on paper, but how would they do this with the way servers work? 
---
Specifically the railroad idea: 
---
You're in an entirely different server almost every time you leave and re-enter. 
---
I guess a particular server could save this progress maybe? but idk if that is possible either and that still would not guarantee you enter a server where it has been repaired. 
---
If you put a ton of steel into it then you wouldn't want that progress lost upon exiting that server. 
---
Again, not saying this is a bad idea. More so that I just don't know how it would work. 
---
My TSE is also legit (a drop) changed my entire build fromm melee to rifleman (2 shot with explosive handmade rifle)  now going to nerf , that really hurts!! 
---
I was surprised and very confused by this the first time I ran into it in the early days of leveling....  It just seemed strange to me that we can use valuable points to purchase all these levels of a perk card but we can't SCALE them DOWN after owning all the levels?  Why?  I don't like having to rebuy the cards all over again just to have lower level versions and so much clutter on my bottom row.
---
My understanding is that too much personalization of any kind creates a problem for the server because of the sheer amount of data. It's not because of the online functionality (which is the explanation I've heard most often)  but because the data doesn't scale linearly as players are added, but, rather, exponentially. 
---
So, I understand why we can't have the freedom to collect every single ball we find and dump them right inside our front door in Megaton just to see how much the game would take before making us blow up Megaton and move to Tenpenny Towers if we ever wanted to sleep indoors again (not that I did that; that was...a friend), or build a town made of turrets and lawn flamingos, or whatever. 
---
But it wouldn't have taken any more memory to give us plans for a bookshelf *with books on it* instead of a bare shelf, etc. For me, the laziness is most apparent when it comes to the magazine racks that don't hold magazines. There is no reason for anyone to put one of those in their house when they don't even look nice.
---
move the whole base and stuff is stored and duped.
---
I need that mutation.
---
Have you ever done it or had it done to you? Because there is evidence that this is impossible
---
So it was you last night.  Sorry but using two shot explosive weapons to one shot people isn’t pvp.  It is abusing broken game mechanics which I label as griefing.   I mean I had full x-01 power armor and 2 ranks of fireproof so 30% explosive damage reduction and you still one shot me.  There was literally nothing I could do to counter whatever abusive weapons + perks + bobble heads you were using.  So yea I consider that griefing.  It is like a fully grown man beating up a 10 year old and feeling good about themselves.  I mean if that is what you need to do to feel good about yourself then by all means go ahead.  But the vast majority of people playing this game do not consider you cool or elite.  If you insist on abusing those sorts of things at least try to role play it and make it interesting by using a melee weapon and then eating my downed corpse.  
---
What do you mean? Materials? 
---
Whats that?
---
Same for Weightless anything with ultra light mod. I have combat armor, marine armor, robot armor pieces all 0 pounds.
---
It feels misaligned with reality to blame "casuals". The complaint is coming from the community of people who don't partake in the reddit based/and pay to play markets out there. People who are trying to play the game without having to go to the internet to get their hands on the TSE.  
---
If the weapon had never become so profound and it truly was rare, people would not care nearly as much. The issue is everyone and their mother has one thanks to dupers. Now, yeah, it needs to be nerfed in a serious way.  
---
Issue two that everyone seems to be saying *over, and over, and over* and is getting old is this concept that ranged has no way to compete? Its just complete BS. Of course you don't have the DPS of a close range min/maxed build. They're giving up the safety of distance, and choosing to play the game with 20% health for that. TSE users give nothing. They stand at 100m and blow fucking swarms of glowing green motherfuckers out of the park. You can absolutely be a lethal ranged user without TSE.  
---
This game isn't fun when everyone around you can sit back at a distance with that kind of power. If it was a sniper and it required headshots to do that damage, fine. If it was a vats pistol build that could get crazy crits but had to give up range and large ammo mags, again, fine. This had to stop - the game was no longer challenging and honestly annoying. Atleast melee people have to run into the fray. Im sure it needs a bit of balancing, but Ive never sat around and been annoyed with melee users being OP.
---
What level are you
---
...without fixing the actual problem, which is stacking bobbleheads :P
---
No shit Sherlock.... 
---
Dig deeper Watson 
---
120+ hours in, I've never seen a living sloth. Just that statue in the east.
---
Sorry new to reddit meant to respond to some one I'm old lol
---
dydamas. Sending invite now
---
Or my CAMP.
---
Or the vendor-bot.
---
I'm on PC.
---
Right now I've got Hardened with Long range NV I've spent all of my caps and springs buying/building radium rifles to break down but I never get the suppressor or armor piercing mag.
---
I love this gun. It's my gun and nobody else uses it. I've spent countless hours looking for mods, I found out that the sunnytop vendor sometimes has a shit ton of modded radium's for sale but I had no caps and I've been saving to server hop until I catch him and can buy his entire inventory..... I'm a junkie for this gun.......this is why this Nerf pisses me off so much.
---
I've been thinking just the same thing! A table isn't a dining table without place settings, and I wish I could put something other than a lamp, vase, or succulent on my desk. Small "clutter" items would be worth the atoms.
---
My sawn off double barrel is heavier than my long barrel double barrel. 
---
Deeper pockets add sometimes 1,5 lbs, or like 40% weight depending of model, to armor.
---
Try not to question it, it's a harsh world with giant rats, ticks and supermutants, glowing zombies and alien relics. And strange laws of physics.
---
Also, not being mean to ol Tom here but this is EXACTLY the reason on why this nerfed was needed. You have people that are not spec’d properly running around still fucking shit up. 
---
That’s a sign that something is NOT right. Good job Bethesda
---
Yeah they should give both shots a 50% that they’ll ricocheted of each other in a Y shape making so you can miss with either or, or both together. 
---
WOAH! Wait a second....there's a "high level" loot pool? Pics or it does't exist. I kill level 60+ mobs all the time and still get level 25 nocturnal wooden pieces way too damn often.
---
Perk loadouts - the role play thing to do is choose your perk cards and not change it for the session. Find and rely on team mates.
---
The munchkin thing to do is swap cards every time you find a lock because you can't stand to be at less than 100% DPS, then swap back. Whenever you're in a team you probably carry hard and have no patience.
---
If it wasn't a strong incentive to role play you wouldn't post about what a hassle it is. Role players vs munchkins is as old as the internet.
---
So would you rather they cater to your easy mode or work on the plans issue or something that is actual QoL?
---
If this is a real question then have you seriously never seen any complaint too petty?
---
It can't be 24 hours. I can agree with a short term timer, perhaps. Ten minutes, max.  
---
It can't interfere with the ability of people to turn off pacifism because some asshole started griefing others and had to be put down. Otherwise people will be put into a position of having to allow the atrocity to take place for they have no interest in losing pacifism while playing with their friends (such as using tesla weapons to take on groups of enemies) or risk getting a wanted bounty stuck on their heads until someone decides to kill them simply because they wanted to protect others.
---
If by "suppression" you mean "most people agree with the nerf" then I agree 100%.
---
Part of it is that a lot of people are ok with it, the other part is people tend to downvote threads that are identical to 100 other threads already posted in the last 24 hours.
---
Conspiracy, lol.
---
I’ve used two serums with carnivore enabled, seems to work for me now
---
Nah mainly it was that infinity pistol cheat with that gun you’d reload over and over to increase attack speed 
---
Do they drop plans to upgrade the armor?
---
* Which events do you feel are most rewarding to you? 
---
 I really enjoyed One Violent Night. It is a fun event that takes effort and was well thought out. More events with hordes of enemies that lead up to a boss fight would be great.
---
* Which events do you not care about doing or dislike? Why?
---
Launching a Nuke is tedious. Fighting the SB Queen is not fun. Scorchbeasts need to be reworked. Too often either too many people show up or too few. That ruins the experience even more because when you do have the right number of players it still isn't fun, especially because the rewards aren't good. I often get repeat plans and more than once have gotten wooden armor pieces for my legendary item... For all that work to get nothing but repair and medical bills sucks.
---
* Which events do you prefer to play in a team vs. solo? Why? 
---
My son and I play together, so we are almost always teamed up. I imagine you mean what events I like to play that require a full team, and the answer is none. I can launch a nuke solo, and I don't like the SBQ event, which is the only one that even requires more than one player. I do want to point out that I hope Bethesda does not add a bunch of group required events to the list, because locking content behind this kind of thing tends to suck. Want proof, look at the SBQ event. Everything has to work out right to even beat the timer. Then you have the issue of the rewards being not worth the damage you and your gear have taken... Stay away from mandatory group events, they aren't fun.
---
* What types of events would you like to see in the game?
---
More horde types like One Violent Night that end in a cool boss fight, or perhaps a Super Mutant lair that you travel through searching for a boss. Nothing that requires more than one player to complete, but I do hope the events scale enemy levels up with the players that are participating.
---
* How do you join events? Do you fast travel? Do you go to a location expecting to start an event?
---
The answer is yes. I do all of those. I do the dailies/weeklies and if they call for an event I could jump to the event icon, I could go to a location hoping to trigger one, I might even reload the server if I want the event to trigger, or if just cannot find an event I enjoy.
---
* How would you feel about bonuses for completing a daily or weekly event?
---
I like a pick-your-prize for completing a special daily or weekly event. Say a legendary weapon, legendary armor, cosmetic, some drugs, some meds, or some caps, for instance. More rewards sounds great, but they had better not be fucking random lootbox style rewards, because I **hate** fucking lootboxes. 
---
I’m gonna enjoy having to carry around 9 Minigun sand 150k rounds fully heavy weapons spec’d and watch someone with 1 rank of each slugger weapon and melee equivalent godroll SBQ still. When this patch drops, I’m out until Bethesda gets the heads out of their ass.  
---
Did you try to hop server? Should solve the issue.
---
there is a google list some where on here with all the cosmetic stuff you can earn. 
---
the events are all randomly timed with the exception of the power up X powerplant events, those trigger when you try to get power from a workshop that uses that powerstation just push the button on the side of the box and the powerup event triggers. 
---
Also, how about a way we can either trigger it while we own a workshop or a timer telling us the cooldown time. I’m perpetually encumbered and I need time to walk my heavy ass back from hunting train stations and new plans. 
---
Please list one of the ridiculous suggestions you've seen.
---
They just work, lolz  
---
On the real though, you dont use a weapon with the tesla's, they are the weapon.  
---
So if you want to boost their damage, you use 'Iron Fist' perk.  This will work with knuckles, boxing glove, death tambo, mole miner gauntlet, death claw gauntlet and power fist.
---
They're okay, but I think you get much better damage from 1/2 handed melee builds.
---
A great idea I read before was to reuse the Settlement Beacon from FO4 and change the functionality to be a Trading Beacon players can build.  If you have a shop at your settlement and want people to see it you can build the beacon and power it.  This could make it so players can see your store at your CAMP.  Set it up to show on the game map or have some kind of map or computer at Vault76s player hub that displays all currently active Trading Beacons on the server.
---
There's an orc camp north-north-west from Top of the World - the bone hammer quite often spawns on a barrel there.
---
For the love of Atom, buff all the weapons DPS and increase their durability, then let's talk about nerfing something in this game.
---
Harper’s Ferry. The plan is mislabeled as “Cryolator Long Barrel” but it’s actually the crystallizing barrel. Think I was around level 35-40.
---
You might be able to get it from scrapping, but I never found enough of them to try it before I bought the plan. 
---
If you’re on PS4 I can mod it for you 
---
Really appreciate you're input man. Cheers)) 
---
My wife had a bug where KLE0 followed her around the entire game. She just kept saying Ma’am over and over. We still laugh about it to this day
---
Nope. You gotta go to modus for that.
---
Oh, gotcha.
---
Well im still curious, what were you hoping was annoying? Haha
---
Or they run into the nuke zone with a team after you kill the scorchbeast queen and kill you to get your loot. Very refreshing.
---
Yeah that's what I mean, mats. And just wanted to say that you are very nice for offering this service to folks :)
---
Not a thing.
---
Yes so I can conquer my fear of cockroaches 
---
I find that interesting, because I’m on the exact same system.
---
You cannot oneshot a player with slap damage. Even with multiple bobbleheads.
---
So you are lying.
---
I have TSE dragon and tried headshot crith with 10 explosive bobles on - it is barely scatching HP (did like 10% of hp) than cap on damage comes in and subsequent hits do almost 0 damage.
---
Moreover recent patch provided absolute protection from TSE: 3 ranks in Fireproof and Dense armor mod = invulnerability to explosive damage,
---
I have full set of Sentinel armor, along with Lone Wanderer - can’t kill myself even with TSE shotgun.
---
So they re basically useless if i use 2 handed weapons (sledgehammer, baseball bat,.. ) ?
---
Thanks for your answer(s) !
---
I was in white springs and the bots did absolutely nothing. Luckily I was close to my CAMP and some missile turrets were helpful but I still died once. 
---
Have you tamed any animals?
---
i bought it just for this picture. https://imgur.com/759iuKS
---
I'm be honest and say for right now I didn't take the time to read your whole post. I will return to it.
---
But... Again, being honest, if they added a mechanic even a quarter as complicated as you suggest without changing how necessary swapping perks in and out can be (with lockpick/hacker and crafting perks etc) I think I'd probably quit this game.
---
That sounds ridiculously unnecessarily complex for something that should be a basic game system.
---
We need “decks” because ya know cards n stuff.
---
I can't take your melee argument seriously when theyre running around with immortal armor sets completely nullifying the drawback of bloodied. And by nerfing TSE to the state they are, theyre forcing anyone who still wants to use range and deal decent end game damage to swap to a immortal bloodied build effectively contradicting themselves when they said they wanted people to be able to play anyway they wanted.
---
I’ve only heard the cry for TSE in PvP if this is the case why don’t they just apply a nerf to that. If they can apply percentage increase against players why can’t they do it to reduce damage to players? 
---
Also melee is OP but I always seem to have issues with actually applying hits. It shows animation of damage such like sound and blood splatter but it doesn’t cause any damage. It drives me nuts. 
---
I disagree. People still play Gta online to this day. The first months of GtaO there was not really much to do than drive around killing people. And Rockstar pumps out Updates constantly still.
---
The advantage of online games like fo76, gtao, r2d2o is that they constantly change. I finished Fo4 with lvl 172 and theres literally no enemies or quests left. Online games get more content constantly and also change often.
---
Also you dont have to worry about progress bc its on a server. Thats useful atleast for me. 
---
someone what i have an extra 2shot if you intrested.. ps4 though 
---
The issue is time.   I just got a 2 shot level 35 handmade and I'm still struggling to keep up with the ammo needed.  If I spend all my time grinding for ammo it's not the most fun experience.
---
Cool thank you
---
I feel ya man. Hopefully this game doesn't go to hell in a hand basket. 
---
Late 40s, both me ( level 120 ) and wife ( level 80 ). Easter time zone. Play anytime....

gt: nothingopen

And? What you may see maybe as proof of a conspiracy I see as proof of public opinion.
---
Brahmin have eight stomachs unlike pre-war cows who only have four. So maybe they poop 8x as much? 
---
Is Honda relevant because you are working on a pistol-whipping robot? If so, can I pre-order?
---
How about this, if they roll back pvp servers....all servers get the rollback hammer? Essentially you're saying my 400+ hours building pvp characters should be for nothing because you can't find a decent weapon or armor? Sorry if it has to happen to one, it should happen to all. Don't punish the players that want to pvp just because of a few handfuls of illegitimate players. You want this game to die even faster, that's how this game dies even faster. Punishing legit players because of a small group is not the way to go. 
---
They use their remarkably long neck for reaching tall vegetation
---
I remember the same issues when playing New Vegas yet I've only encountered input lag a few times in fo4. 
---
I fear in 76 the actual server connection makes the already existing problem (the input lag) worse. 
---
Still I would love to see it fixed. 
---
I really doubt it's intentional although you could be right with certain animations.
---
Personally I just thought every other gun class needed a buff slightly Nerf tse and kill stackable bobbles and mags true balance lol
---
Unfortunately this is what we got...  
---
No one talks about this but they shadow ban anyone at low karma count. So for example if you're a super fan boy you might get 100 downvotes get into negative for your new account but keep posting without realizing you're banned.
---
I think it's truly horrid.
---
2 characters, one is 120 and the other is 60
---
I don't think they have ever said we are on "season 1" and this is a game that is going to evolve over time like fortnite. There is some dlc type stuff planned but no indication this game as it is now isn't the game forever. I don't think they have made any indication the story overall is going to "progress" 
---
I would love to be able to sell stuff via our camp.  get a notification and if we want we can travel back for trades too.  having vault 76 would be a perfect spawn point for having another place to fast travel too that doesnt cost caps etc.  so many benefits to it.
---
Sorry I responded to the wrong person lol. I asked you if you are on PC because I was going to say you could join up with me and my friends if you like, we're friendly and have a discord and very casual and I like to adventure :)
---
Ps4 too! I'd buy/trade it off of you yea!
---
I can only offer armor pieces or caps though
---
Game still in Alpha. Give them some time. 
---
Thank you! Beth was also “Nate and Nora adjacent,” as I’d played her as a family friend who went to stay with them while her dorm situation at C.I.T. was being resolved. Nora away in Boston when the bombs were dropped, and in the chaos Beth was given her spot in Vault 111. After she got thawed out she got swept up in that wackiness of the Commonwealth Wasteland which suited her warm but weird and whimsical personality.
---
Martha on the other hand was always the more serious one, despite being the younger one, and shares little of her sister’s strangely carefree attitude. As she grew up in Vault 76, she disliked the fact that she came to look very much like her sister, and while both have the same smarts and the same skills, they are very different people. The younger is cool tempered and reticent and proves that being good and being friendly aren’t the same.
---
XBox 1X - My game keeps getting stuck when I start start to craft or repair on my armour bench inside my CAMP. I just had to shut the game down twice and restart it. I'll try moving the bench and see if that helps. I've been using it in that position for months. My character keeps hammering at the bench and ignores controls while the rest of the game continues as normal outside.
---
That’s awesome !
---
*Careless Whispers opening*
---
give me 500 c and its yours lol Psn is Dukeofgodz ill be on in like 15 eating
---
I just thought it would work like the other events. Just resets every once and a while. I lose resources I've invested in workshops or Anti air turrets in the bog. I wouldn't mind investing resources for a free fast travel for a game session.
---
And this game is absolutely nothing like most Bethesda games.  Fallout 3, 4, and New Vegas had me wanting to restart them almost immediately after I beat them.  Fallout 76 is not like any of those games. 
---
try getting a piece of gear with AP refresh speed on it. with lone wanderer, 2 AP refresh pieces and well fed/watered i regenerate 250ap in under 8 seconds. Lets me shift those action girl perks to more adrenaline.
---
This was always the issue that needed to be addressed. Instead of fixing the bobblehead exploit they nerfed the most common build into the ground and pretended that TSE was the problem. Bobblehead damage stacking with curator exploit was always the problem. But it's easier to nerf than bug fix or actually balance. New armor and perk defenses against explosive dmg would have been sufficient balancing, but they have a 75% damage reduction planned for BOTH legendary prefixes. *Fix bugs and balance, nerfing is lazy*
---
Thanks! It's pretty cool with the loading screens, I love that!
---
top of the world, there is that entrance on the eastern side of the hill top where all the flamers are. there is a section of the containers that has a bone hammer in there that you can loot from the world. 
---
TSE Shotguns can get really high Damage with the right perks, but a TSE Handmade, Falls well short of the Damage done by many Melee Weapons, The only real massive one is the TSE The Dragon, which easily reaches 2K damage, and used with Stacked and Duped Bobbleheads can reportedly go over 20K Damage per Shot.
---
You average 1 mod for every 5 to 6 Radium Rifles scrapped. I know your struggle. I was there and I’m still trying to learn a couple more.
---
Quad is better now with the nerf to 2 shot. I do highly recommend you go with a more stealth VATS commando build. Good luck’
---
Awesome, got a 2s laser rifle and really interested in a 2s plasma aswell!

Thanks &lt;3

Hardened Mass is no longer junk 
---
Monorail! Monorail! Monorail! Monorail!
---
Well, if they were related I would be able to shot more rounds of my non legendary gatling laser compared to my TS one.... which is not the case since both break after I have killed 15 mobs. What I felt is related is the fact if u have the mod which increases the DMG and reduce the fire rate, that makes the weapon more durable (less bullets been shot).
---
I assume you didn’t like it. Do you have any things you think I could improve on? I only recently started drawing fallout stuff.
---
Go to Whitespring and buy all those Blueprints for camp. There you can leave you caps 
---
I’d love to be able to send a message out to everyone on the server to join up for the powering up events. If events become larger I’d want a way to send a text chat to the whole server to coordinate event completion.
---
Me protecting Pheonix from all the mean protectrons 
---
Mobs will still be cleared in a single shot lol.  Yea, the TSE weapons are being toned down.  Demo Expert still affects it.  I'm still gonna go to the golf club and clear whole waves.  Im still going to one shot nuked mobs in Whitespring.  Instead of 1 shotting players in PvP, Ill 2-3 shot them.
---
People act like stuff is gonna change.  Even nerfed, the TSEs will be better than anything else, except possibly melee and im sure melee is getting nerfed next.
---
I'm currently doing the same, moving points from iron fist into rifleman.  
---
But at the same time, don't you feel like you're cheating?  
---
I got to level 70 unarmed, had a TSE lever drop for me, now I just kill whatever I look at.  
---
Ghoul's run up in my face?  Marsupial jump and shoot the ground.   Scorchbeasts that I used to flat out run away from are easy peasy pigeon shoots.  
---
I personally like that they're going to make it a little harder for me to use this build, but it will make hybrid builds and situational weapons pretty cool, I think.
---
A single dragon with no rifle perks can 3 or 4 shot a level 50 scorchbeast you just need to learn the game instead of relying on overpowered weapons like what an opponets weak points are how crits work( stealth, natural, and vats) 
---
and with how tse was you never would of seen a dmg buff for guns at all, not with how much tse weapons could do as it stands they could buff guns but they weren't going to do it and make tse even more room clear in one shot op.
---
Doing the Order of Mysteries questline and having to kill different creatures, I knew there was a spot up the hill from my camp where animals usually spawn and figured just I’d go take out the radstags or whatever spawned there that time... so of course it was house cats and I couldn’t.
---
Where did find jetpack plan/mod?
---
Yeah you had me confused as hell there...lol. And sure, I am open to joining up. Thanks for that! 
---
My boyfriend and I also both play on console! :) But I do have the pc version as well. Planning a single player play through in a few months.
---
Honestly, the biggest problem with damage and the like right now is the whole 'oh, well damage per second is what really matters' so weapons that are uber heavy and should do massive damage don't do the work they should for a completely arbitrary reason of 'oh well, we need dps to be ballanced across all weapons' when done as an over time thing, which is fuggin stupid.
---
There is a reason black powder weapons were phased out, they weren't as effective as smokeless powder cartridges.  Yet Black Powders do more damage per shot than a military grade weapon, all because of the rates of fire are different.
---
I get that having all things be viable is a good thing, but don't force it by making things that should be good suck, make it through other things.  Black Powders, Pump Actions, Double Barrels, and Revolvers should all have massive durability bonuses to make up for the slower rof compared to semi autos and the like, as simplicity makes them rugged.  Much like how, for the most part, laser weapons have few moving parts.
---
TL:DR, damage per shot and fire rate shouldn't be balanced to average out with other weapons, fire rate should instead be used to balance out base durability, with damage being dependant on weapon class/ammo
---
Wow LMFAO, you are funny, i was joking no you're not white knight much? Pun intended. 
---
I have had many crashed from Fallout 76 however I have never gotten a BSOD. Are you sure you just dont have hard drive issues or a problem with your computer? I can understand consistent crashing to desktop being a client issue, but BSOD it more than likely an issue with you system.
---
Check the games error logs and check your systems error logs before moving forward.
---
buy all the plans? or buy the neon sign under plan and letters from watoga vendors worth 9,600c with max barter skill heard actual price is 12,000 and trade for weapon? 
---
Good because it is annoying. Games get balance changes. Get over it
---
I understand the reasoning here, but I dont know if I’d support it.  My main is level 116 and I’ve created a second character whose sole purpose is PVP, currently level 28.  I’d really hate to start over again and have my current PVP character be a complete and total waste.  I say it would be easier if PVP servers simply prohibited some items with OP legendary effects to be used against players.  Basically have the explosive effect do nothing against other players on the servers flagged as PVP.
---
I  reckoned no one would see this.
---
There are no stat bonus' from any helmets.  They are all cosmetic.
---
I was having a dream where I was fucking this donut, and woke up with a pounding hangover.  I fell out of bed, and while standing up with my eyes still blurry, I could clearly hear another vault dweller talking loudly to himself about "Fallout history" and other things that I have no idea about, and frankly, did not care about.  I just wanted to punch whoever that was because I could literally SEE the person's words through my raging headache. 
---
When my senses started to sharpen a bit, I came to the horrid realization that I had no recollection of how I got in there, who I was, or even what happened the day before.  What the hell was in that punch?!
---
After walking around pointlessly, I finally found something called a Pip-Boy in a box next to the door.. which refused to fucking unlock until I put it on.  Am I in a prison of some kind?  What the hell is going on?  At least I can get out now.
---
After talking to a few floating beachball robots, it becomes apparent that I am predestined to leave this place.. for some unfathomable reason.  You say that the end of the world happened?  You say that I have to leave this place to live in the radioactive wilds of the post-apocalypse?  Why?  The lights are still on in here.
---
Oh well, out the door I go..
---
(time passes)
---
My mind is pretty much gone.  My reality is something that I am weaving as I go.  Nothing makes sense.  I still have no idea what I am supposed to be doing, and can now jump 3 stories into the air.  Over time, I have managed to scrape together a small house complete with a fusion generator that I made from glowing ghoul guts, clipboards, and desk fans.
---
Damn, the game finally started getting fun after I got a two shot (non explosive) rifle. Enemies die in a reasonable amount of time now instead of requiring an entire drum mag. I actually started to build up an ammo reserve to use during nuke events. F 
---
Yeah but for that alone it’s a 2x damage multiplier in pve. Compared to 10% damage all the time. It should be at 30% damage when mutated to allow legendary item variety 
---
Actually nice suggestion!
---
Can we have “change perk” option along with “new card” and “switch special” after level 50?
---
If full respec is something requiring dozens of levels - it would actually add meaning to builds.
---
Oh you just saved me a giant headache today. Thank you!
---
"We tried to do it again right after, but the server disconnected."
---
That is my 76 experience in a nutshell.
---
Sounds like a fun fight though. Cool you got through it once without dropping.
---
Got the plan in a trade earlier
---
People sell signs and letters for like 2k now. It's been duped. 
---
Does your friend have proof?
---
TSE is the only good roll right now, that's why it's being nerfed
---
In case you weren't aware, Optimized servos for the torso are great for melee builds that use PA as they add 2 strength.
---
If you google "fallout 76 power armor mods" there are complete lists of mods and effect for each PA type.
---
I am on PC.  There was a vault boy sign left of the door with "Schrute Farms" pasted across the chest in small lettering.  My camp is a brick home with the most useful amenities downstairs and a small interior farm, with multiple beds upstairs and an astroturf rooftop patio with a grill, chairs and a tented musical area for people to get buffs while afk.

If you got some benefit from my camp, I take a great deal of happiness that I could make something to help you.  My in-game name is Shankwell.  Add me as a friend.  I'll be happy to help you on quests, level up, gather materials,  and crack stupid jokes.

Upvoting the constant down vote no matter the post there seems to be alot of whining and hating so I'm doing the only thing I like annoying people 
---
Ok so basically everyone’s like
---
&gt;‘please nerf TSE Bethesda it’s too over powered’ 
---
Then when Bethesda do actually nerf it by like 30% everyone’s like
---
&gt;’ pathetic , you shouldn’t have done that buddy’
---
yeah mate , it’s peak if you obtained the weapon legitimately but either way the combo is ridiculously over powered and it shouldn’t be that way , besides with the right build 30% is like minor👌🏼
---
10/10, would highly recommend
---
I actually did that last night. Was thinking of rebuilding my camp today bc I spent two days buying camp plans that I was missing. 
---
Sure thing. Add me on bethesda, username is wheeldogz. You may or may not want to venture with ME per se but we've got a lot of people on the discord and you'll hit it off with someone I wager. Also I have a lower level character I can jump on to play with ya :) (my main is 213 but my alt is like 13 I think)  I will PM you an invite to the discord 
---
Honestly, I don't even understand what you said.
---
I had 2000+ 10mm rounds till I found one of these.  10 kills later I'm like well that was fine, scrap 10mm guns from now on
---
The nerf is fine IMO but it was still the wrong way to go about it, they should've just changed the modifier tablet to not allow 2 shot and explosive to roll on the same weapon. It is far too powerful, no player or enemy should be 1 shot by any weapon in this game.
---
This weekend I cleared out several nice bloodied explosive weapons.  Noone wanted them on the market, so the Watoga vendor got them.  I feel your pain.
---
I've been having tons of freezes and crashes ever since the patch too. I tried reinstalling, but to no avail. 
---
I am having a lot of fun with this game.  I still occasionally have an issue with getting dropped from a sever, but it seems to happen less now.  I am looking forward to Bethesda fixing some of the bugs but even with the bugs I love the game.
---
He said he saw it at a vender and it was 600 caps I'm thinking it's just regular Ultracite power armor
---
well fuck i think i might just go buy them than lol..rather not buy a duped but fuck if its thst cheap sorry bethesda 
---
Nah, give us a Molerat Queen, make it disgusting and nasty much like Skaven Broodmothers would be, and it launches all kinds of molerats at you during the fight, it'd be an interesting battle imo.  Have it spawn by nuking uncanny caverns
---
It’s just a garbage design in a garbage game 
---
One thing that "worries" me, is the day this game isnt suppported anymore. It will happen. Hopefully its a very long time, but i cant imagine it being around until i die. Isnt it weird we wont be able to play the game? Like, you can load up your world in fallout 4. You could do that 20 years from now and it would be exactly how you left it. Its yours. What happens to all the time we put into games like these? I think about this alot with GTAO also, as its the only other online game ive ever gotten into.
---
Hope that makes sense.
---
If you have never been annoyed with melee users being OP then you must not have played the game in the beginning. I have been playing since beta and have played through the current meta change. 
---
At first everyone and there momma were looking for a furious or instigating Grognaks Axe.  There were a plethora of posts about people getting one hit killed in PA, myself included, outside of PvP by these op melee builds. 
---
In my opinion this nerf is ridiculous. The simplest way to fix this issue and keep everyone happy would be just to make explosive its own primary effect.  There’s no need to go through and completely ruin all explosive weapons and all two Shot weapons in an attempt to “ balance” a game. 
---
As it stands if this patch goes through the way it’s currently set, we will be back to the Original meta being the new meta, again!  I mean shit if Bethesda wanted this game to be a power armor and melee game only they should have just sold it as such.  Why even have ranged weapons if the DPS is a hollow joke compared to melee?
---
Sounds great man! Let's do this! 
---
 Ok good 
---
Mhh damn. Ok then I have no idea haha. 
---
Thanks again. That was very generous of you. You made my day.
---
Love these :) congrats on 50!
---
The other day I took a workshop from a lvl 21. He had 20 turrets set up. I could help but think that his next move was to come to this sub and say "I'm quitting after getting griefed" why are people so sacred of being killing in this game? I don't understand it. I can't wait until the PVP servers come out.
---
He means that you are increasing the popularity of the spot, so that he is going to have to server hop more because more players will be looting the area.

You made Friday even better than I could ever have thought.

One that isn’t a mule? Just to try out new builds.

&gt; Why do you assume this is true?

Because that's how it works in other games. You're not suggesting that fallout players play fallout exclusively right?
---
I get the impression you haven't played many pvp games.
---
This would only contribute more to server instability due to the database having to keep track of significantly more items. Let's fix the server stability before we think about bogging it down with more visual crap that makes you feel at home and does nothing else. 
---
I suppose so. They would need to do something about server stability first though.

Crashing would make that annoying

Mia Han, a young, brilliant, vault-born doctor, her early childhood was filled with medical research books, and she started her journey with the intent to find cures to new diseases wrought by the war and provide medical aid to the people outside the Vault.  
---
Needless to say the latter half didn't work out so well, and now she spends most of her time concocting cures to various diseases she exposes herself to, (SH, I know all disease cures are the same) providing medical aid to other Dwellers in her home in the mire, and hoping to create possible vaccines for the future, and find a way to reverse the Scorched process (though its a bit difficult to get a perfect specimen for her research when most have a sniper round lodged in their head).

Her positive attitude and tendency to pretend things aren't as bad as they are is a bit grating on the more gritty inhabitants of the wasteland. Shes a bit eccentric in her tastes too, so hope you like Mothman Egg Omelettes!

&gt;eded to be addressed. Instead of fixing the bobblehead exploit they nerfed the most common build into the ground and pretended that TSE was the problem. Bobblehead damage stacking with curator exploit was always the problem. But it's easier to nerf than bug fix or actually balance. New armor and perk defenses against explosive dmg would have been sufficient balancing, but they have a 75% damage reduction pla
---
Explosive damage and the regular damage from TSE/TS/ANTI armor can be fixed with the right armor, armor mods and build.  The issue is the Bobble head stack. The funny part is the people who are really bad when they face a good player that rocks them, they start popping bobble heads and act like they are amazing when they are just terribad. I find it comical honestly.  Even explosive shot can be a problem getting the right mods for your armor is a task in itself.
---
willing to trade for your 5mm, wont be on until tonight though.
---
I think that the only kind of ultracite armor that exists in the game is ultracite power armor, but ultracite combat armor would be a cool addition to non-power armor users.
---
wood armor, wtf. 
---
Honestly there should be varied amounts based on the number of stars of the legendary. 1 star mutated, 10%. 3 star mutated, 30% plus the other effects. 
---
I think we could take a lesson from warframe's eidolons. Without the annoying damage gating. They basically have a shield that you can destroy in your operator form, and then have a heavily armored body to take out. You have to target each limb individually and repeat the process for each limb. If we could avoid the shield system and just have damage to limbs that's either required or very beneficial to the fight, that would be great. As it stands with the SBQ crippling her only makes the fight a bit less annoying.
---
There's no good reason to be doing that much damage. You'll still do fine without Two Shot, Explosive or both at once.
---
Around the same amount of my ass your mom sucked last night.
---
Any other questions? 
---
It’s because it was made with love. Love generally weights about five pounds. 
---
Full iten drop on death ;D
---
Yeah my friend said it was blue and red
---
Just fix the bobble head stacking and figure out a way to get rid of all the duped TSE's (though that's probably impossible)
---
The other elephant in the room is explosive splash damage should've never been 100% you shouldn't be able to clear a room by shooting the floor (ditto pvp) this was a seriously stupid oversight. Smaller explosions would also help with this 
---
Seriously the nerfs are garbage I'm a lvl 102 I've never come accross a TSE legendary drop and I'm ok with where TSE's are at damage wise (except for explosive splash damage)
---
They should also make an incisor like perk for guns it'd make damage from guns closer to what you can do with melee 
---
Which makes absolutely no sense.  
---
Hopewell Cave, but you'll need marsupial or a jet pack to reach it.
---
It's actually part of the lore... Think about it. Who set those bathroom stalls up? Vault 76 dwellers because we went insane waiting for content

The surprise just adds to the fun

are ya ready kids!?!?!?

Yeah that was it! Sorry for your camp, I'll add you when I'm next online
---
She sucks a lot of ass, I'm not sure if the ass she sucks is clean or not though, can you tell me?
---
Yeah, they're for people following "The way of the empty hand"
---
If you have the slugger perks, or melee weapon perks at all, go for optimized servos.
---
It’s not bugged. The legendary prefix is on the gun/armor... not the mods. The prefix does not effect the mods, and it’s not supposed to. The mod isn’t weightless or reduced, the main item that has the prefix is.

I just said screw it and added all the songs from FO4 to my playlist on spotify [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5YPb7yl53NaTnj8WMcqv8S](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5YPb7yl53NaTnj8WMcqv8S)

with a couple of additions that fit the genre.

You have to admit, it is  wet close to a perfect simulation of being in a vault and being messed with.

I don't think it is intended to be that way, but I definitely appreciate the similarities.

Melee is still broken as fuck so there's that.

 The nerf to 25% will make my one shot exploder a shotgun again. Now its an OP missile launcher.

Before your angry reply to me i demand you list one demand from any game that is too petty for you.
---
Perk cards, pacifist mode changes, banning dupers, hubs, trading services / vending machines, text chat, push to talk, workshop PVP nerfs, connecting build items issues, targeting team with VATS.
---
Exploring workshop spawn issues is valid but repetitious.
---
From the front page right now:
---
Gun weighs 20lb, mod weighs 1lb. When you put the mod on the gun it's 26lb (not going to read this title is too petty)
---
I would much rather wait 30 more seconds on a loading screen than to spawn in and have to wait 30 seconds with just a floating head. - 198 upvotes, intensely petty.
---
Take wood armor pieces out of high level loot pools - over 1000 upvotes, do you munchkins ever role play?
---
You should be able to de-level perk cards. - 386 upvotes, would you rather they work on actual content once in a blue moon?
---
Instead of bare shelves and tables, why not have variants that are stocked with (static) items? - 109 upvotes to explore this boring issue, yet again
---
How about about a "no PvP" Mode, too? - over 500 upvotes, can you Fall Off and just play Fo4? This is intensely stupid as literal. Why would these people even buy this game.
---
Aye, agreed. Seems to be a lot to take care of before moving on to adding more fun stuff.
---
now THAT's what I'm talking about

Tall neck. +5 perception, -3 endurance, -3 agility
---
Yes shotgun and harpoon will still be strong
---
Add me when you are on, I still have them.
---
Guess I'll start spending some caps, haha. Thanks for the help! 
---
Trying to stir up the hornets nest I see. Moving on.
---
Yeah melee users are still riding high, which is why i have a melee char as well
---
Hackin and wackin and ...

When I grabbed them the other day there was a 125 LB barbell.  Hadn't seen that, before.
---
My main character is...
---
Mizque; conosuer of almost all things edible, he likes his food fresh, not canned, and avidly hunts for all recipes he can, eager to know how to make as many tasty dishes as he can despite the world ending.
---
Alguacil; An old, true blue, this former responder dropped on working to combat the scorched threat, due to his hatred of all things raider.  Judgemental to a fault, his revolvers have spelled the end of many a raider or slaver, with little thought of trying to reform them
---
Sweet!
---
You like debates, with objective determinations? I'll copy / paste my replies to others in this thread but basically munchkins vs role players. Pretty sure you never role play anything ever, IDK why you grinders even play MMO's.

they should jsut nerf all bobble heads so when you eat one it just replaces what ever the current effect is like drugs.

It might have just been bad luck. Whenever I'm on a new server I always hit up the gym at Flatwoods, if it comes up empty (someone probably got to it first). If I've looted it in a given day I've seen the items straight up disappear on a server-hop. There was a couple times where the room was completely replenished and it seemed like it was linked to a hard server crash so I'm not sure what the mechanic is since it's hard to test for it.
---
Before I server hop I'll go to a point of interest different from the one I expect to be coming to. Had better luck by doing so. 
---
did your friend take a picture?
---
I’m able to put a flat roof on top of it with no problems. I build a little box like that for workshops. Stick down two floors, six walls, 2 flat roofs with the generator inside. Use a pass-through conduit to get the power out. I’m on PS4. Always works for me.
---
Good gravy---that's like 35 straights days of playing, 24 hours a day...and here I was thinking I was a super fan. I bow to your magnificence.
---
It's when their meat is still tender.
---
I don't think this is what's happening.  Weapons that can one shot lvl 91 glowing death claws are broken af and needed to be fixed.
---
They will still be good, just not OP. And once melee gets their turn with the nerf bat, things might finally even out...if they ever fix energy weapons
---
those were probably already looted by someone else. flatwoods gym is the first lead spot you can get and most people just farm flatwoods before even leveling up 
---
I'm using a handmade.  Tse.  With all 3 rifles.  And I'm just starting the explosive I can hit around 250.  Say with all of them I reach 450.  I'll be honest I haven't duped yet and have 4 charisma bobble heads and 1 heavy weapons one.  I have yet to see a rifle one. 
---
But I thought that's what the Whitesprings golf club already was lolol.
---
Honestly tho yah I agree with this, no player hub in an online game is horrible design.
---
Yep. Your a professional indeed. 
---
Nope he's a low level so i think it was just regular ultracite power armor 
---
always gotta get a healthy dose of that ass ^^
---
One of the core tenets of gun safety is to know your target. I mean take 5 seconds to identify your target
---
My group is currently working on trying to power as many plants as we can simultaneously. I want the wasteland to glow. 
---
Along with this i wish they would clear up the card UI. Its too annoying to deal with and i feel sorry for those on console without perk manager. Since Beth made us jack of all trades over class systems or any lock in system.
---
Yeah, I just re-tooled by build around a 2-shot shotgun I found.  Going back melee...
---
Well said OP. All the melee uaers are celebrating for pvp reasons, but the community will complain about the next OP build which is melee. This nerf is just the beginninng. More are on the way especially for melee if this nerf passes through. I dont like Pvp personally, and my legitimate tse is only used on those who seem to want to make me pvp. Did tse need a nerf? Yes. Perhaps to the explosive increase from perk cards. That would have been simple and enough.
---
Without demo expert being able to apply, my quad explosive only does 330 damage and after the update it will do even less. 
---
One of two things will havr to happen, either the tse will need to be properly balanced or melee will be nerfed next to make it balanced. 
---
People fail yo realize that this update us not only a simple nerf, but a dangerous road that the company is heading down. There are other things going to be affected by this nerf. Good luck actually killing the queen if she doesnt land for a decent amount of time. 
---
Again, this what is wrong with F76 community. Labeling things that aint griefing, into griefing. If that is griefing, then people who attack wanted players with slapdamage protection is griefing too. You don't see those people coming posting how "F#cking griefers killing me while I can't do no damage to them".
---
So you mean if you find Flatwoods empty, you go Sutton Station, hop, then go to Flatwoods?
---
I only get crashes every two hours on same system.
---
Had a similar idea earlier. They could put it as an option on the already existing inventory wheel, just pick a spot and assign it or don't, is up to the player. Open that slot, and instead of swapping weapons or using items, it opens a separate wheel for perk loadouts
---
Bear doesn't swing that way.
---
Same, haven't seen a TSE, but I recently got a two shot lever from a vendor and a two shot pump drop.  Guess I'll have to suffer because of dupers as well.
---
I suppose getting a two shot or TSE Gauss or handmade would still be better.
---
I've encountered various scenarios in bathrooms. Some people apparently used the toilets to make soup for example.
---
You sure? I have one and its 45 still.
---
Agreed....if camps setup as shops were not subject to destruction from other players....otherwise griefers will just go blow up your base to be aholes.
---
Or their fertilizer is far more refined to make better boom booms.
---
I usually hold a Workshop for lead, like Lakewood Cabins.  Didn't realise gyms were so full of lead.
---
Yeah, it's nice. Interestingly, if you put the wrong mods on the weightless armor ut can make it so that the chameleon no longer works.
---
I finished it, what kind of bugs are people getting?
---
That is good info, nice find.
---
This got me. I was moving around to find a new camp.  Started building and it said 175% stored. I thought that spot had a smaller budget, so I moved again. Nope x2 of most stuff.
---
As a streamer: why don't we organize workshop PVP like on a weekly schedule like on PS4? Why isn't every other post asking to organize something imaginative and different? It's like you're all so literal you don't even understand you can use reddit like that, as if you'll only PVP when there is a specific mode for it.
---
Why is your post just complaining instead of engaging? Do you understand how forums work?
---
That'sMyFetish.gif
---
Bobblehead stacking with infinite curator exploit is the real villain here. I actually thought the new armor and perk defenses against explosive damage neatly addressed the PvP balancing issues, and I was genuinely impressed with that scalpel instead of hammer fix. Then I read that they plan a 75% reduction to BOTH legendary prefixes on the ranged meta. *facepalm*
---
This is lazy AF on the devs part, but I can hardly blame bethesda when I see the community calling for nerfs. No community ever should call for straight nerfs on meta builds. There's always a more elegant solution, but real balancing is hard and takes time. Knee-jerk nerfing is the stupidest precedent we could set this early in the game development. Now, instead of intelligent discussion about the dangers of nerfing instead of balancing and bug-fixing, we will start crying for bloodied melee and flechette/shotgun nerfs. This all suits bethesda just fine since instead of producing new and challenging content they can simply nerf XP and danage output to slow player progress through existing content. Ugh.
---
i've made much more use from lead belly than cannibal but the two go hand in hand. its much more effective if you have the carnivore mutation as well, i've since dropped down to lvl 1 cannibal
---
Bigger nerf then that,  say each round does 100 not legendary,  as of now you get 80 for 2 shot. So thats 200 ish for just explosing or 180 for just 2 shot and depending on perks 360ish for both
---
20 and 25% now is 100 to 120 or 125. So we are looking at 150 ish for tse. Because thats percentage based.  Thats quite the nerf. So 30% ? Nah brah nah.
---
For a crit build would a bolt action pipe pistol be better? I know there are mods that increase crit damage for those. I am actually really unsure if you can mod black power weapons.
---
Omg haha tysm!!
---
Is that why I found a 3\* LMG on a vendor? Mirelurk Damage, Exploding Round, and 250 DR while reloading.  I went ahead and bought it since I don't have a legendary LMG yet.
---
If I have to replace my batteries while playing once I replace them I can hear my teammate but they can’t hear me. We’ve started using the Xbox Party mode to get around this. It’s a little annoying. 
---
I've been wondering if I'm not just missing an overseers cache. Except for the first couple i just stumbled across them, somewhere along the line i stopped getting map markers.
---
Agreed. and might as well be able to delete or trade in or whatever to cards that that will never be used.
---
Honestly I've thought that from the start. The don't need to remove them altogether, just remove the effects from PvP so your TSE shotgun is just a shotgun.
---
It’s in the atom store :)
---
Did you even read the patch notes? Its a 75% damage reduction to BOTH effects.
---
sweet thanks
---
No problem, happy trails!
---
In all fairness pretty much every enemy has potential for a cool variant. Imagine a megasloth king or honeybeast queen. Or an ant queen from fo3. Imagine infiltrating a honeybeast nest - the queen sends honeybeasts after you, and those in turn send bee swarms. It would require far more cooperation in taking out the adds, or a great deal of skill to solo. 
---
Because in all the games with pvp and pve servers inevitably the pvp servers lose population to the point where they get phased out and either combined to one last single pvp server or dropped entirely. I think BGS intent was  to have pvp/pve in the same game/server working together in an apocalyptic way, they are trying something different in the way we interact, I think they just need to keep moving along this path it could eventually work if implemented right.
---
I have 2 accounts level 130 and never seen pvp do people actually pvp lol?
---
I wouldn't say I'm freaking out, but it is frustrating to farm a weapon to you want and then have it nerfed because it's too op when combined with another legendary effect that you dont personally have.  2shot alone is not super op, pretty much just right actually. It's the other effects that are weak and they dont measure up. You shouldn't nerf something that isnt broken. Tse is broken, just dont allow the two effects on the same weapon. Easy. 
---
Just going to say thank you for this mature reply :)
---
You got downvoted but i'd be happy to be friends with someone like you: PSNid Enterres :)
---
Usually I just go to vault tec agricultural area, log out then fast travel to flatwoods hotel upon login
---
I'll have to get some screenshots tonight.
---
Oof
---
Technically the quest is finished when you launch a nuke and listen to the final holotape.  
---
But I don't think the actual journey is over.
---
I adore the game but it's very naive to play the blind fanboy role. Alot of the negativity has alot of ground behind it. While i probably be with 76 for years and years to come. I will not forget the past issues and the current ones as well.
---
Don't let your love of Fallout and 76 make you blind to the issues we face. If the game is going to keep getting better it requires the negativity when it messes up and the feedback to correct it.
---
lucky me, my base is just outside of the nuke zone lol
---
&gt; It's a rare drop item. As others have said, if I'm going to spend weeks grinding for something it better be worth it. It's even harder finding one you're spec'd into.
---
I think you meant to say it's impossible and you bought yours.
---
I can double check in like 2hours
---
As if there aren’t posts every day on this sub from people who love the game
---
Assaultron Blades
---
They're *long,* *hard,* and *powerful*
---
...hey wait a minute, I thought they're supposed to be female
---
Well...I wouldn't use the word 'great'.  There's still many shortcomings beyond just the bugs.  But I up voted anyway because I am still enjoying the game with friends.
---
you want math. here it is. it's scary.
---
let's take a Explosive Combat Shotgun. Not Two Shot, the regular. How it works.
---
On paper (current version, I've tested that combat shotgun shoots 7 pellets)
---
let's say your level 50 combat shotgun does vanilla (without perks) 16 damage per pellet (112 damage non-explosive).
---
Explosive adds 100% weapon damage as AoE, so same 16 damage per pellet.
---
so, short, vanilla damage= 7\*16 + 7\*16 = 224. fair enough
---
say you have a regular setup with 45% into shotgunner and 100% into Demolition Expert (about average), some may run 60% shotty, but i see no reason to waste so many useful STR points. You also run 15% bloody mess and you use chems (psychobuff lets say) for 25% bonus. Let's omit tenderizer or Adrenaline stacking.  
---
so, sheetwise, it'll be
---
16\*1,45\*1,15\*1,25=\~33 ballistic damage
---
16\*1,45\*2\*1,15\*1,25=\~66 explosive damage   
---
Add them up and multiply by total pellets and you get
---
(33+66)\*7=\~698 sheet damage. Seems about right. I have about the sam number (slightly over 700 i think). this is all before any armor calculation  
---
that's on paper.  
---
Reality.
---
a Monster has typically 4 limbs, chest and a head, making it 6 hit zones, each with own damage calculation (each separeta resistances). Some monster may have more, some less, but typically it's 6. A single projectile (bullet or pellet aka no AOE) will hit one part once. Explosives (rocket launcher missiles too) has AoE, where each hit can hit multiple zones. That is dependant on zone spread (physically how far they are from the hit) and perks like grenadier (boosts AoE radius by 100%).
---
Let's take a dude (a supermutant for example) with 6 hit zones. you hit a chest with all pellets and every other zone will be hit as well
---
* For ballistic damage it's sill going to be 33 damage per pellet or approx 231 ballistic damage for all pellets (before armor calculation, depends on the zone)
---
* For Explosive damage it's 66 damage times 6 zones per pellet aka single pellet does 396 damage. A single pellet. For all pellets, thats 2772 damage. Yep. a single explosive shotgun, if it hits all enemy zones, will hit on average build nearly 3K damage a pop. 
---
And then you ca factor 2-shot, although for shotgun, afaik, Two Shot is actually a bad prefix, as it adds just a one pellet, so it's just maybe 15% increase.
---
But that's not all roses. Here's why it really shines against regular size targets, and sucks against Scorchedbeast Queen:  
---
EXP damage scales with tight zones. SBQueen does not have that. You can verify with Awareness and Concentrated Fire. In flight, zones are well apart and even with 100% into grenadier, it's pretty much impossible to hit multiple zones. Inflight, Exp shotty (or any exp weapon) does very little damage against her. If she howers, you can hit maybe two zones, if you hit her just right.  
---
Only if she lands on the ground, you can shoot the ground to maximize AoE effect (can hit all limbs, they're tightly togethera and probably belly) and you'll see a visible damage. Normal Scorchedbeast is smaller and zones are a bit tigher, inflight it's still a lowish damage, but on the gound, normal SB is oneshot (if you hit the ground beneath it).  
---
Also, i'm not sure about explosive resistances. Resistances work the way that against armored enemy, doing 2x50 damage is worse than doing 1x100. And shotgun does pellets aka many hits but low numbers. Throw in high resistance (like SBQ) and it'll be severely suppressed. That's why sometimes, hard hitting explosive (per hit) may actually be better, like explosive gatling gun.
---
Oh you know. Mama suck a dick, get stab. Here I am.
---
Yes! We're in Appalachia, where's my moonshine operation?
---
I'd give up workshops because of this but I want more plans and things (I only once set up an extractor). I'm thinking about taking one in a low level area, setting up turrets, letting them attempt to defend while I attempt to stay hidden somewhere else, and then just retake it eventually if they fail, as long as it's a not an actual player who took it. Get it back, get the reward, and just relog. Any fault with this plan?
---
Alright, great tip, have to try this.
---
Just give the snowflakes time and they will cry about something else, and then it will also get nerfed. It is a never ending cycle, example: Bungie
---
Likewise, I don’t kill anything that manages to avoid my bullets.
---
ASSUME THE POSITION.
---
quitting to main menu and hitting play again will put you on a different server than you were just on. This often resets the area you are in, re-spawning enemies and such.
---
There is. Its is easier to find them in the wild or at workshops though.
---
I dunno, it leaves a crappy taste in my mouth.
---
I agree with you, the implemented Nerf is going to have some other unforeseen consequences but they will be addressed as they arise. But there are still plenty of great weapons
---
Honestly just make their be highly aggressive level 200 assaultrons with SBQ level HP that attack anyone who does any destructive action in that area, or simply disable attacking ect in that safe zone.
---
The main hub cities in Wow are reached before level 15, still new player areas and covered with high levels.  Storm forge and Orgimmar always have both low and high levels with no real issue.
---
I take a shotgun, I saw off the barrel and stock, it gains an extra 6 pounds.
---
You can’t explain that.
---
It's a fantastic Fallout setting buried under trash game design.
---
We have such sights to show you.
---
&gt; We tried to do it again right after, but the server disconnected.
---
I don't really need hope for the game. It's a good game. I just need it to work right.
---
Well I was tired of one shotting with my All Rise sledge  so wanted to try rifles (lost track how many times I killed myself with 2shot)  but it was different and yet still fun kinda wanted to move away from PA no didn’t feel any different than my sledge actually a little more challenging but at lvl 187 I will just go back to All Rise (3star) already have perks so now just need to move points it’s all good though I love this game 505 hours deep 😀
---
There is a problem with that actually, as it would punish people who are playing legitimately and not using TSE.  Headshots do more damage rather easily, and missiles do alot of damage as well, and don't get me started on mirv mininukes if you know how to aim them
---
It would be the Ironforge (vanilla WoW) of FO76! I love the idea! This would be the start of guilds/clans being easier to form, more community feel. Bethesda make it so!
---
Yeah you can craft them they cost flux from nuked zones and a chem bench
---
I love the ideas--and in fact have posted a few similar ones myself.  The issue for me is permanence.  Some of you may recall the AQ event in WoW--where a massive amount of resources were collected through dailies/grinding to open AQ.  That would be an amazing system to implement to rebuild the AppWaste...but without server permanence it won't be possible.  I love how "Powering up Poseidon" affects surrounding  workshops--and it would be great to see players repair the Monorail over the course of a month or two for free fast travel to the RR stations (you could have daily events plus scrap turn ins of like 10000 bulk steel) but it can't be done without permanence.  People will say "It could just be events."  Yeah, it could.  But do you see people doing an event that takes a large amount of X resource and time just for free fast travel (until the game crashes and then that work is for nothing--much like capturing a workshop, building everything and crashing before the first fusion core is produced)?  I think the idea of "instances" needs to be revisited.  Just my 2 caps.
---
I have that. Ha, I'm probably overdoing AP refresh. Cause I use food buff, armor buffs, and action boy. I have rank 1 adrenaline because there are diminishing returns. But I could try that and rank up something else. and i only run 2  end with rejuvenated switching to ghoulish for nukes. I always well fed and watered up.
---
I dont think Beth can afford the player loss for nerfing melee. Ranged could use a a revamp, or really just have perception increase damage out put similar to strength affecting melee. And yes I know,  better seeing doesn't = stronger bullets but it does = better accuracy which means more damage. 
---
Sentinel for sniper, but players using it are reporting it's not that great. Do use chameleon in pvp. I love it and most people I fight that are serious about their pvp use it too.
---
That it's still listed as an active quest
---
Kinda like veal...
---
Mmm...I love me some veal...
---
You can literally just Xbox search for their user from home, then select "join game"... No need to even let them know you're stalking them, ever
---
Fantastic!  No huge deal on the camp, just annoying.  I'm sorry that I couldn't be there in person to give you food, water and other supplies.  As a higher level that spends most of my time doing nukes and farming legendaries in Whitesprings and Watoga loops, it'll be nice to add more purpose to my day.  I'm a good team player.  I swap out some damage perks during events and team play so I can hurt an enemy but not kill it outright with OP weapons so teammates and other event participants can share xp and loot.
---
Thanks. Being downvoted doesn’t bother me at all. I always but heads with these kind of gamers.  
---
I’ll look for you in game. 
---
Evil Smasher, just....keep it on you, laugh when your rocket launcher gets the EVIL SMASHING proc for x10 dmg, and x4 mag capacity on that reload (iirc, it's been more than a few years since I last played it)
---
Revolutionary/Chinese Sword, or maybe a machete
---
Black Powder Pistol
---
Pirate Hat
---
And I forget what suit goes best with the hat
---
Pretty sure that’s the Confirmed Bachelor perk.
---
Instead of boring and frustrating like it is now?
---
Lol I like the game but let’s not kid ourselves with fantastic 
---
It's possible for a game to be both enjoyable and have significant flaws.
---
I think FO76 is fantastic and also broken in many ways.
---
Played TR as well.  Very, very disappointed when it went under.  I like the idea of having alternate payment methods available.
---
Good stuff; keep it up!
---
The difference is you can still pick up a rifle and do about 60% less damage (baseline) than a rifle main.  But a .50 does 44 damage and fired fast most players have a back up gun.  If a rifle player tries to melee.....might as well bend over and ask for it gently. 
---
Cheryl "Cherry" Daily was born and raised in teh vault. Her dad was somewhat obsessed with Nuka COla and had a special supply of Nuka Cherry that he kept for special occasions, one of which was his daughter's birthday ... so, every year, Cheryl got one Nuka Cherry from him as a gift. He wanted her to grow up and be the next Nuka-Girl "When we rebuild America, we'll need a symbol. Nuka Girl is that symbol and, by God, you will BE Nuka Girl!" ... she wanted to be a teacher, but, well, dad was pretty darn insistant.  
---
(You can read more about her dad in teh Vault security files. he was a tad miffed when some of his drinks came up missing.)  
---
Since leaving teh Vault, she's focused mainly on the Responders, trying to help people out that she sees, dropping off food and drink (and, yes, Nuka Cola) whenevr possible, She's picked up a set of Nuka Power Armor now, so she can make her dad proud, but she'd \*really\* like to find somewhere nice to settle down and raise a community.  In a perfect world, this would be a cleaned-up Flatwoods, with teh bodies given a proper burial, the town fixed up, and a nice market center for new people to join in and to both sell, and buy, wares as the economy is re-created.   
---
But before we do that, she's gotta take down this Scorchbeast Queen. Launch a nuke? Are you KIDDING me?!
---
I literally kill myself more than anything.. Thanks Explosive anything and shitty aim
---
I can agree, if we all focused on one thread it has a better chance of being heard because it moves up the list.
---
I can't feel my legs!
---
That's a different quest line - that one starts via a briefcase at the Vault Tec Ag Center, and it closes out fine. 
---
&gt; Because in all the games with pvp and pve servers inevitably the pvp servers lose population to the point where they get phased out and either combined to one last single pvp server or dropped entirely
---
I don't know what games you are talking about here - I've played nearly every RP MMO in the last decade..and I've not seen this to be true.
---
And even if it was - if pvp servers lose population to the point they are shut down - that just points to a disinterest in pvp.  It should survive by it's own popularity.
---
Even then, since FO76 uses small-scale instancing instead of set servers - it would only take a very small percentage of players opting in to pvp for pvp instances to be healthy and viable.   We are literally talking 24 people per "server".
---
Only perks that beat it are bloodied if you don't mind low hp, or junkies of you don't mind having no special stats and basically on drugs 24/7 or your character becomes usless
---
Thanks :) 
---
Sorry "bud", crowned enemies are bosses in this game, and how ironic that you then shout out the queen who is very much the last boss of the game, "bud". 
---
I've seen the Queen one shotted by a TS Fat Man. You seem thoroughly full of shit. Impressively, even, "bud". 
---
There is no like button on reddit.  Only upvotes or downvotes based on relevancy.
---
I would totally pay 2000 atoms for a "clutter" pack.
---
5.56 isn't that rare if your in the divide/bog/mire areas, and two shot doesn't double ammo consumption, it was litterally just a 100% damage bonus before, so teh reduction to make it only a 20% damage increase seems fair, as it brings it in line with the other 'flat damage bonus' effects
---
I have a furious explosive harpoon gun. It's not great, even with heavy gunner and demo expert at max. Outperformed by any standard heavy weapon just based on fire rate alone. 
---
That’s what I heard too, so I was wondering. I can snipe or be a mobile gunner so I was debating. If you use chameleon does your tag show up above you?
---
The PVP isn’t good, and I don’t expect it to be good, but that’s a separate issue than “people who play the game more than me have better stuff than me.”
---
Yeah that was my point, if you don't use sneak multipliers you burn through ammo on bullet sponges and take increased durability loses.
---
Maybe alter some mods on legendarys to not proc on other procs, for instance if you have a sneak modifier on your next shot have it take precedence over explosive or 2 shot, so people using sneak multipliers aren't receiving stacked damage+ modifications on each hit, and someone not using a sneak modifier on their next shot gets a proc from 2shot etc.
---
I'm just saying 190 is an awful lot on an *unperked* weapon, not that it would be enough to kill someone. It's with perks that it becomes a monster. I get my info from 150+ levels of gameplay, the two shot gun is overly powerful compared to everything else and I see that gameplay style as unwanting of a challenge. I get some people dont want the grind, I think those players just made too much noise and bothered too many people with the weapons that allowed it to happen.
---
the update hasn't even come into effect yet and you're already throwing in the towel? I was pissed when they nerfed melee in the first patch but at least tried it 
---
What you got?
---
LOL @ the apology before shotgunning that newbie to death.
---
do you want me to make it prime? i can do that and make ammo but i need mats for ammo
---
I hsd that issue in the past, pre patch though but im pretty sure it will solve it
---
One of the problems is that enemies tend to come at you from the front. All the time. I hardly ever seem to get bit in the cheeks or need to whip my character around like in other shooters and such. You can just vats absolutely everything and be Terminator. ggez. Imagine vats in COD? literally aimbot. So they need to improve enemy/boss fights and puzzles within those fights/events (maybe powering up/fixing multiple things to trap the boss for a certain amount of time to do melee damage, then she breaks loose and you gotta do it again etc..). Destiny for example always had a nice peak of difficulty during fights/events with friends/solo. Granted, two very different games, but you see what I mean. 
---
Just got a furious buzz blade. 
---
I just want to rename it the weedwacker. 
---
It moves down everything. 
---
Flamer, flamer solves most of those problems with the honeyed beast thing, the problem is that flamer fuel is retardedly rare, and prohibitively expensive to make

I see, I’m not on the game right now so I’ll check later to see if I have the small me problem too, but I don’t remember seeing it. 
---
&gt; It's ridiculous to blame PVE players for not participating in PVP.
---
*buys a PVP game, demands the Dev.'s make it PVE only*
---
I have a a few guns that are similar to in game guns. I'm gonna start comparing them to show Bethesda. I get it that they are probably not gun people. Add in the fact they are based out of gun hating Maryland and many guns in game are prohibited in MD. So they would have to guess.
---
Thanks! I know I’m not the best the best at drawing, but I enjoy fallout and drawing, so might as well draw.

You're my evil twin. I'm also level 30, also a sniper. But I love FO4 whereas you express the casual, lazy opinion that it's somehow not the best Fallout game. No. Obviously, I was born first and you're wrong.

&gt; catering to the Whitesprings farmers
---
How are they doing that when they nerfed Whitesprings xp as well? If anything they are catering to all the people who want this game to be a tedious grind. 
---
&gt; excuse the immense power creep two shot brings.
---
\&gt;literally beem in the game since release
---
\&gt;power creep
---
Guess that sounds about right if power creep meant the exact opposite of what power creep means.
---
Another good thing is to move your camp, even if you only move your camp an inch or so, a lot of phantom things will pop up in stores
---
You will have to rebuild unless you have it blue printed though
---
Oh that's just from legendary effects being broken when stacked together at this point, and the glitches with bobble head stacking and the like
---
No thanks I de-modded it for less weight to keep it in my stash until the tse patch is out :) 
---
You need a quad explosive harpoon and make it flachette. Multishot is OP w/ explosive.
---
Its making the grind for weapons even more pointless than it already is lol. Its like oh hey I found this great weapon! Two weeks later its nerfed :(
---
For the Overseer's Quest, a marker only pops up if you're in the general vicinity of one. There is one inside Vault 76 that doesn't count for the challenge, 17 outside the vault. Most are tied to areas that the main story brings you to, with only the last one kind of out of the way.  Spoiler about the location and content of the last one: &gt;!At the Mountainside Bed &amp; Breakfast, you hear what is implied to be her final stand.!&lt;
---
Thanks for repeating everything that has already been said. 👍🏻
---
All I'm saying is that OP should have listed some examples just to make clear what he's talking about. I agree there are some "easy mode" requests, like ammo scraping (this basically makes no difference what ammo you hoard if you can just convert them one into another with some losses). Just to figure whether I should upvote or downvote his post I need to understand what suggestions he's talking about, right? "Some suggestion are bad" isn't really a constructive discussion.
---
That poll says that the average person works for 3.5 hours per day. I'm not sure how much stock I would put into it. Tons of adults get by on 5 hours of sleep per night. Maybe the people in comas are throwing off the numbers or something with 0 hours of work and 24 hours of sleep.
---
Please. Assume. The. Position.
---
I think it's a good location because you should wander around for a while before you find it. I got there around level 14 which seems reasonable for joining the rebuild. I didn't have my camp set up very well before that. I could plop a shack down in the ghetto now.
---
Practice will make you better, so keep going.  Too many young folks nowadays stop working at anything they can't do perfectly on their first try.  Real skill requires time and dedication.
---
Take off your PA helmet if you are using the Targetting HUD or Sensor Array.

Its the one that highlights enemies in a red aura.

This should help with the CE-34878-0 crashes.

Its great but this nerf is making me take break tho. Im so mad rn lol. 
---
I gave this a dislike because it's a bad game
---
Thanks for clearing that up. Much appreciated.
---
I regularly loot Camden Park and I've yet to really figure out what is account bound and what is not. Most things (junk items, weapons, chests, corpses) seem to be on a 24 hour reset cycle. Some things, like traps, are not. There's 6 can traps there. That's about 50 lead each run but you will have to server hop for those.
---
I have not tested having someone else load into the park (that hasn't been there yet) before me to see if all if the loot is back.  I just know that if I were to go there now, it would be mostly empty because I looted everything last night.
---
Eidolons move slow making it a lot easier to target the weak points. That would be a lot tougher to target on SBQ. 
---
agreed. i love logging in and hate logging out.  my only issue is its really hard to find any friends. i've only made one in about 100 hours of play.
---
I have countless hours of playing and have only seen sentinals drop on one item. I currently have about 12 3* armor pieces and only 1 has it.
---
If it takes that long to obtain a full set, I am perfectly happy with having a reset on PVP servers.
---
I have a reason to grind(pvp) and a very long way(scarcity) to go to achieve perfect gear. Both of which lead to a combination of what makes an MMO successful. 
---
It does make sense. People want specific skins on their character. If you add stats to head armor then people will be forced to wear helmets that don’t want to wear helmets for aesthetic reasons. 
---
I agree with this. It would be cool that it has it's own server and be able to handle more than the normal cap of players so it would be a point to meet other people and grow a real community in-game.
---
I agree with most of your post - especially the overall premise that crafting is nearly pointless aside from modifying a dropped piece of gear.  I’d love to be able to wear armor and carry a weapon that i crafted myself. But if I do that I am handicapping myself because crafted mods fall far short of dropped legendary items and there is no way to close that gap.  That essentially forces people to farm and fight for drops in a small number of places.  
---
That's fine. And they seem friendly.
---
I used to work a mud crew (cement foundation crew) and for some bits of the pour we had to use these to make sure things formed properly with the slab
---
My name is Matt. After I left the vault I was having a really tough time and struggling to find my place in the world. I was getting really lost and felt very alone. I wondered around the wastes for a while looking for food and something to drink. I was from vault 76. I ended up getting in such a bad place I was found in the woods by a man named Wooby. He told me about the responders and a place called Flatwoods. I was not from around here before the bombs dropped so I am exploring it all for the first time. 
---
I set up Responders Radio, a radio station for those who want to relax and be there for each other. 
---

If I’m correct there is a mod that lets you do this. I know its not lore friendly but still.
---
Sweet. Now I know what my next character will look like. Thanks 
---
It was pointed out that these people were sneaking which hides them on that map. Figured you’d know that since it’s common sense but well...
---
I want to do another playthrough of it, but they haven't really fixed any of the issues that made me stop playing in the first place.  FO76 has been a real let-down.
---
Nope, no tag. 
---
Yup.  They are Raiders and know how to force PVP.  As I said, I just avoid workshops unless I'm ok with a fight and have a few mates on to help out.  
---
You will want to claim a few over time if you want certain plans as they're rewards from WS defense quests, but overall they're pretty useless as you can farm items faster than they produce them.
---
Unyielding melee builds are still going to be able to do 5-10k damage depending on consumables, so many will just go back to that 
---
There is a trailer nearby the nuka cola factory, just  on to the other side of the bridge, found a dead radroach sitting on the toilet holding a cane and wearing a bowler hat.
---
You're a bad game!
---
And let's be honest, after 20 hours in game the grind for better weapons is really all we have left.  The current "game" is essentially a FANTASTIC background for an actual game that hopefully will be released in future content. PvP mode we can opt into sounds great, but we have very limited info on how this will be implemented. 
---
Bummer,  maybe remove/ reinstall? 
---
Randy Ralphson remembers little about himself before the war. He only recalls the last moments of his service in the military. Walking. Shooting.  Running. Running. Falling. Trapped in his now useless power armour, unable to move, watching as his platoon was cut down with brutal efficiency. A red-eyed figure staring blankly at him, and then nothing.
---
When Randy woke up, he assumed he was in some sort of purgatory. Pristine walls, high quality blankets, and of course, the vault 76 insignia -Wait. Vault 76? Randy had no clue how he was in there, nor did anyone else. His files weren't in the database, either. The lack of information and Randy's unappealing looks brewed distrust towards him, and he usually secluded himself to his own business as long as that "Izzy" gal didn't come nagging him about guns and whatnot. Some of the braver little kids sometimes came to Randy to confirm rumours, while the adults stayed back with wary eyes.
---
Eventually, when the doors opened he set out to find out what his past life was like, and more importantly, what brought him to the vault in the first place. He never got to speak with that overseer lady apart from that time they tried to figure out why the hell he was there, so he walked outside, determined to gather what fragments of his past he could find.
---
Pretty weird right? You can still find him trudging along somewhere in the Savage Divide in his suit of x01 armour . Only god knows where he got that from. I dunno maybe you can speak to him or something, see if he found anything about his past. I ain't going there myself. 
---
What? Not only was that not an angry reply it wasn't even a reply to you unless you're an alt of natedog62.
---
&gt;i demand you list one demand from any game that is too petty for you
---
Wierd question, not sure how it's relevant to my post but sure: Vanilla Ark settings demand you to carry out this very involved and difficult taming process for an otherwise mediocre creature called a Troodon. That's too petty for me so I've never bothered taming one.
---
&gt;Perk cards, pacifist mode changes, banning dupers, hubs, trading services / vending machines, text chat, push to talk, workshop PVP nerfs, connecting build items issues, targeting team with VATS.
---
Is that a question? I don't understand what you're trying to say here.
---
&gt;Gun weighs 20lb, mod weighs 1lb. When you put the mod on the gun it's 26lb (not going to read this title is too petty)
---
Are you saying that their complaint is too petty? I'd disagree on that one, weapon weights are inconsistent and sometimes like in this case, absurdly heavy. I agree on the loading screen one though, who cares? If it bothers you that much though just downvote and move on.
---
&gt;Take wood armor pieces out of high level loot pools - over 1000 upvotes, do you munchkins ever role play?
---
I don't understand what this means, what does wood armor have to do with roleplaying and why are you calling them children?
---
&gt;You should be able to de-level perk cards. - 386 upvotes, would you rather they work on actual content once in a blue moon?
---
You know quality of life fixes and new content are not mutually exclusive right? Bethesda is not a game studio run by some guy in his garage with his friend that took a coding course once in highschool, Bethesda has a team of developers.
---
&gt;Instead of bare shelves and tables, why not have variants that are stocked with (static) items? - 109 upvotes to explore this boring issue, yet again
---
Welcome to reddit, downvote and move on.
---
&gt;How about about a "no PvP" Mode, too? - over 500 upvotes, can you Fall Off and just play Fo4? This is intensely stupid as literal. Why would these people even buy this game.
---
I don't think fallout 76 was ever marketed as a pvp-focused game. Personally I don't care if a pve only mode is implemented.
---
I don't see how any of your examples would make the game easy or boring. Except maybe the pvp thing like I mentioned.
---
Hi, you left out the platform you are playing on.
---
Im on ps4 so that aint happening but i apreciate it my dude
---
Cannot wait to come back to this post a year from now when Fallout 76 is still a fucking mess...
---
Yes the main menu needs like bullet points from the devblog and a read more button 
---
 I just go first person and its gone. ;)
---
You're not supposed to be getting that. It's either a joke, meant to show that Bethesda feels this is a long term game, or actually to stop people from playing for 760 hours because you know people would do it just to hit the challenge
---
I'll be honest. And I'm not just gonna talk shit I just wanna give my honest opinion. Fallout 76 for me is just weird. I love the world and enjoy the gunplay enough. (better with a weapon sounds mod). I just think the game is too barebones for me to really enjoy. Not to mention the bugs upon bugs upon bugs. I wanna love this game (I spent money so I really so wanna love it) but at the present moment it hasn't shown me enough to truly enjoy it. I really have high hopes for the future though. Again I need to state that I'm not hating on the game. 
---
I feel like there’s got to be more coming and at some point you find her body or something. Just my thought. 
---
Crafting fusion cores or gatling laser?
---
You can easily find cores in more unclaimed PA you find. Power station workshops produce fusion cores as well. Sometimes ghouls drop them as loot (I suspect you have a greater chance if you have gatling laser in your inventory)
---
I wanted to mess with some berserkers ranged weapons to see how well they can compete. 
---
Yeah, I want to make the swap to those but I kinda got rid of mine when I got TSE versions. 
---
Drop rates are kind of screwy for those- at level 140\~something now and i've probably had 3 or 4 times as many gatling-plasmas drop compared to just regular plasma rifles. 
---
You will forever be known as Topher-Fury, the brown ~~nosed~~ faced cannibal.
---
I love this idea. I would also really like to see some kind of pick up game matchmaking. Even one where people can search for group from multiple servers then it puts a team of 4 on the same server. 
---
Very much this.  I would have loved a single-player or basic co-op version of this setting with NPCs' to flesh out the story.  It's such a great setting, and I feel that it was wasted by trying to shoehorn in MMO concepts...
---
Problem. If I had been let’s say 21 lbs over weight limit, it’s uneven. Is that 10.5 caps? How about just free fast travel?
---
I mean... it's a good game.  It's not a fucking game, those are usually in VR and cost money per minute...
---
Not that I'd know about that...
---
Thanks. I know how frustrating it is to loose any portion of the camp budget. Hope it helps!  
---
Yes, it affects everything you build at camps.
---
“People who play the game more than me have better stuff than me” is not true for this game and never has been. 
---
In this game, people who have better stuff are dupers and/ or people who are okay with real world currency, for their stuff. 
---
It's not now, and had never been, a simple case of those who are more dedicated getting better gear. 
---
You can always get a Scorched instead. They fit in barrels perfectly.

"Sorry, can't to QoL changes until we finish nerfing every viable build into the ground to slow player progress and create the illusion of more content. Next stop, bloodied and shotgun/flechette nerfs!" - Bethesda customer care
---
Lol yup and this will still happen after the shitty nerf.
---
Exactly this. TS is perfectly fine as it is.  Allowing it to be paired up with explosive was a huge mistake.  Fix the mistake without needing TS. 
---
I never leave my character at white springs when I log out, I had the same issue, spawned in a nuked zone, lesson learned, so I walk to the train station and then log out. I still don't get why someone else can loot your junk when they didn't kill you, it shouldn't be allowed.
---
Don't craft man its too expensive and pointless. Spend a day with the 3 workshops they will give you 8 fusion cores each per hour. Then you take the perk to reduce energy ammp weight by 90% and walla carry 100 of them and they weigh nothing.
---
Note : Currently Energy weapons are right fucked. So many issues with them too list. Almost everything about them has bugs or issues. Thats why you don't see them been used.
---
Very big thing to watch is the ammo it can show your fusion core amount over the ammo amount. You can looose so much ammo because of this single bug.
---
&gt;if shit worked people would spend more time playing and less time complaining
---
LMAO do you even human?

My best weapon is a Two Shot; I'm not looking forward to utilizing 75% more ammo to accomplish the same task.  Explosive effect needed tuning through, there's little denying that.

Captain Jospeh Tecumseh Dawson, US Army, Brevet General, 5th US Reconstituted Army Division.
---
General Dawson mustered into the 5th at Camp Mcklintock.  Displaying immediate proficiency for combat, he was sent to ranger school, and then on to the US Special Forces Command and trained as an explosives expert, after which he performed admirably in three continents. 
---
Then-Captain Dawson was home at his house in Flatwoods on leave when the bombs fell and took shelter in a local vault.  Along with Lt. Billy Basher, he was the only Army officer alive in WV when Vault 76 opened.   
---
Having found the chain of command and basic infrastructure of the Army completely shattered, and Appalachia in dire need, pursuant to Army regulations governing exigency circumstances he accepted an emergency brevet promotion to General of the 5th Division and immediately instituted martial law of the Eastern Commonwealth.
---
He has established two forts along the Eastern edge of the Savage divide, secured the entirety of the Forest and reconnoitered most of the Mire.  He’s also acting quartermaster of the 5th so let him know if you need supplies.

The two shot from the vendor most likely came from a duper anyways
---
Do you mean the marine combat helmet? Thats from the dev room, this is the one that goes with the armour.
---
The marine tactical helmet is the wetsuit helmet which can be gained in game legitimately from plans that are world spawns in craberrybog. The item also drops from the mirelurk queen as a rare drop.
---
Me as well I was so excited to find a two shot combat shotgun. 
---
I find the suggestions so whiny and simple. May be I grew up with hard game I don’t mind of most drivel people keep complaining about. But it’s seriously nauseating, like why is this sub turning into a therapy group.

You do know that your Rocket Launcher after the patch is basically Bunker Buster right?
---

---
I've had that happen a scorched I shot too, after a sniper shot to the back of the neck
---
Thanks! Updated. On PC
---
Touche. Im all on board for that. 
---
No idea, I guess they trying to address the griefing problem/explosive problem, this is probably a way to try nerf some of the TSE stuff, don't full understand it but we will see.
---
My guess is we won't really notice it too much but time will tell, I can't see them making the weapons completely useless but who knows.
---
Then the power armor helmet and gas masks should give no stat boosts.  I'm forced to wear that crap to go into nuke zones or places with airborn toxicities.  Or they could let you put ballistic weave for hats or other things if your into aesthetics.  It's a lame excuse to not have a defensive stat on something that can reflect bullets.
---
Again, RMT and exploits are separate issues than what you said, which was “people who play the game more than me have better stuff than me.”
---
 Weight is an issue. Not the biggest one, but simple math shows that's not right...
---
Lolwut? How does balancing weapons create lag?
---
Yeah. I think they should up server size once it is more stable. 24 players is kind low. Maybe 32 or something so you still see people but its not constant
---
I had to delete and redownload my game post-patch as well but due to a weird error message. I don’t think I’ve blue screened since then but I also haven’t played much.
---
Why not 75%? No affix should be able to do on its own what 15 perk cards do. +100% damage is just insane. 
---
It the price we pay for progress and viability. The days of "having host" is gone. R* has done something that a lot of people said wasn't possible. Hopefully Bethesda can learn from R*
---
Mine is one wirh sleep problems wheb he is out there killing he insta sleeps(disconects) and he was a police officer. Well thats it
---
Word.  I was cool with someone trying to get a big bounty, but the rad shower hurt and he went after it relentlessly multiple times until I got wise, crouched with chameleon armor and caught him as he broke down my front door. Just being bored and doing it once or twice to spice up your night I can accept, but this guy tried every trick in the book to mess with me.  I'd never been trolled like this, (quite a few hours in Unturned and Rust, and this was special) so I stupidly repaired it several times.  Lesson learned.
---
I'd like if we could use the Nuka Cola plant.  Give it something else of use to do since it was one of the lackluster places to explore when I went there.  It looks really interesting and cool on the outside, and so LARGE, but then you go inside and it is.... well not a lot. 
---
To stop giving caps when making this cola, it should just be put in a basic carton like dirty water or a canned tube like purified water.  
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griefer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griefer)
---
Welp the first sentence in that above pretty much sums up my experience last night so yea you are griefing even if you don't admit it to yourself.  I would like to thank you since I DID learn something last night.  The game does a horrible job explaining how pvp works in conjunction with workshops.  I did not know you could pay the workshop in order to 'take it' then use that as a license to kill/murder someone in their camp while they were crafting ammo.  The game also doesn't do anything to show that hey you're now in pvp mode so you should should probably take off pacifist since now it just means you literally can do no damage to the person killing you even if they stood in front of you, flicked your nose and then one shot you when you tried to kill them.  It also isn't clear by the notification about workshop pvp that it isn't location dependent, ie it isn't just someone can try to take your workshop and you can choose to show up and defend it or not (which is more or less how I assumed it worked).  It's not like when you have a bounty where it clearly labels you're in pvp mode...  Nope, you get one tiny notification in the upper left hand corner of the screen that someone attacked your settlement and if you're to busy to notice it you have 0 idea someone is able to kill you whenever and wherever they choose, which is very easy to miss if you're in the middle of a fight.  The only reason I learned the above is because I DID notice the message and thought it was a workshop defense mission.  I DID travel to the workshop, didn't see anyone or anything attacking, grabbed some materials from the harvester while I was there and figured it was a bug.  There is nothing wrong with the vast majority of the community.  There is a reason why in World of Warcraft the PVP serves were by FAR the lowest population servers but Arena and to some extent battle grounds still get a solid amount of play.  Because then you KNOW you're in PVP and what to expect.  You get given the tools you need to at least be reasonably able to do something in pvp, even if you're terrible at it.  It's why they nerfed the shit out of stun locking and the most abusive CC's that were abused early on.  
---
The problems with the community as you say are more with the horrible state of the game and is on the game developers than anything else.  It is bad because it doesn't notify you that you're in pvp in some cases but DOES in others (ie when you're wanted or if you shoot someone for slap damage).  Again, don't push onto the community you abusing game mechanics and claiming you're pvping legit.  Creating a separate set of servers where it's always on pvp is totally a step in the right direction and gives you someplace to go play with others who also want the trill of being killed at any time when you least expect it.  Hell if they legit fixed all the duping bugs, completed a solid amount of rebalancing of the game and forced people to create new characters in this pvp playground then I might even see a point to joining in and having the possibility of fun.  It might even be fun if it were even remotely balanced.
---
No, unfortunately ps4, but i appreciate it anyway
---
This would be amazing, we also need server wife text chat, similar to esp, for trading or whatever. Make it optional for people that don’t want it as a bother.
---
I have really weird bug often about since last patch on PC.
---
I join a game, I can crouch perhaps, but then it stops responding. I can't move, shoot, or open pipboy. I can open map but that's it. I've waited for minutes and I just can't do anything except exit and try again. It has happened quite few times, luckily not every time, but way too often.
---
Really sucks and I need to wait for the loading screens because alt+tabbing when they are on, seems often to make the game run on reduced graphics mode.
---
There were totally penalties inat least MO, get flagged red and there were a few guilds that actively hunted murderers and protected innocents. I think dog company was one of them
---
Again, ive never seen players who will only fight bambi players. They might be more cautious to engage with geared players but they still will if they think the risk is reasonable 
---
Good idea on Perception increasing dmg. Didn't agility do it in Fo3? It's been awhile
---
Not much. When i learn something, i mark it off. It takes like 5 seconds, because i keep my laptop open next to me. And it is oddly satisfying to mark them off. 
---
Na im not quitting for good I love the game to pieces, just mad. Taking a break until the nerf goes into effect and ill take it form there. Hopefully im less upset about by then. 
---
If you do not have any mutations or plan to not use them, don't use a mutation based legendary? How hard is that?
---
Mine shoots a paper bag full of all my shit onto the ground when i shoot something that gets too close.   ;{}
---
&gt; I don't see how any of your examples would make the game easy or boring. Except maybe the pvp thing like I mentioned.
---
Complex = fun?
---
[RPers vs munchkins](http://www.firedrake.org/roger/rpg/munchkin.html)
---
&gt;Or maybe you can actually put forth some effort here and give some examples?
---
GIVES EXAMPLES: Perk cards, pacifist mode changes, banning dupers, hubs, trading services / vending machines, text chat, push to talk, workshop PVP nerfs, connecting build items issues, targeting team with VATS.
---
&gt;Is that a question? I don't understand what you're trying to say here.  If it bothers you that much though just downvote and move on.
---
Very patronizing. You ask for examples, don't understand they're examples, don't understand the conversation about why they're petty, and then tell me to ignore them like that is helpful? Are you just proud of your ignorance in general?
---
What objective determination exists to tell whether a Dev. suggestion is petty?
---
IMO - adds complexity, gives role playing challenges like with "Perk Loadouts." Your role play challenge for next session is to choose one loadout and not change it no matter what happens. Good luck!
---
They could just mark player vendors as essential so they cant be killed.  Make them passive too so they are literally invincible Vendortrons and if someone blasts your base to smithereens all thats left is a lonely vendor bot walking around your barren camp.  You would still need to repair the beacon and crap, but the vendor cant be killed.
---
When you build in the workshop, the materials will start off displayed as green text.  
---
As soon as an item changes from Green to White text, you are now using your supplies.  
---
Green junk items are the workshops supplies, white junk items are yours.
---
And what does it costs?
---
Unnecessary. You can just keep picking the same card until you have one of each level. 
---
If you could de-level them, there would be less to work for in terms of build optimization and build optimization is an important and gratifying part of the endgame. 
---
Yea its not going well lol
---
I really enjoy the high school event if im the only one doing it. Just grab the monster mask then get back to the lobby and climb (jump) up and get on the lions head and pluck bad guys off with minimal effort. I almost always get heavy combat armor pieces that I BoS upgrade and sell to players in need. Not to mention the candy rewards, monster drops and event rewards.

I see down side to this ability, I dont think it hurts game play at all
---
Could be, it's been quite a while since I've been on FO3
---
Dog not do! They good boy. Maybe someone else hack you?
---
I get this almost every time I log in :/
---
The fact that you have the ankle-holding technique down is impressive. Takes years of professional ass eating to learn those skills. 
---
There are people who want that? 
---
People will dislike this but fuck it i am not gonna hold back here. I use TSE weapons and i 100% agree they needed a nerf into the ground for many reasons.
---
Two shot outshines all other main mods. Why take 50% more damage at 40% hp etc?. Explosive was just broken as fuck. Most i reckon complaining here are gonna be those who bought them for large amount of caps or one of the 1000s who paid real money for them ( thats just counting ebay).
---
So yeah i am sure if someone paid 8 dollars to 65 dollars for the god tier ones they are gonna be pissed.
---
But let Bethesda do its thing i am sute many balance changes are to come with these changes. 
---
Fuck TSE weapons they are boring and the game needs massive balances to survive.
---
Ultima Online, Rift, WoW, Age of Cona, Troy, Forsaken World .. theres more but the overall theme here is when you separate the population it inevitably leads to mergers/closures. 
---
It's definitely not disinterest as these company researched a market and found enough cause to make these servers but maybe it's just poor implementation in those games, mmo style games containing quests, npc banter, buying/selling to merchants, resource collection .. to simply make available areas open pvp zones because it's a pvp server ends up contributing to it's downfall, they never take into account trolls or quick hoppers, people who join just to mess around attack other players etc, but don't ultimately stay for the long run etc. 
---
I think BGS intent was actually on a path of working this out .. but not entirely focused, we can have pvp and pve all on one server where we can interact and support while seamlessly giving these players their game modes.
---
lol cry moar?
---
The public workshops all have nodes that will produce whichever resource they are. Taking a public workshop also counts as a quest so you get rewards including camp plans and stimpacks.
---
Is it not the in game time?  I haven’t paid attention 
---
If you've got the excavator armor and a bunch of acid reserves, west of fort defiance past the monorail is a cafe. Lucky hole mine. Lots of lead ore deposits.
---
There's also a place in Toxic Valley where you can put both a Junk and Lead Extractor in your camp in Toxic valley it's east of the black bear lodge. I was thinking about relocating back there. For the longest time I was set up on the black titanium extractor location east of harper's ferry. I got tired of always running low only on Black titanium for X01 repairs.
---
You have to love well-meaning, eccentric characters!
---
So far the best outfit I have used is the duster from the atom shop. I can't help but feel like I am missing one though...Maybe the drifter or hunters long coat outfit?
---
I get that, which is why you would pick a pve option here and stick with it anyways
---
Lol that's what redditors do to games. They are lazy even to things in a video game and want everything to become mindbogglingly boring and easy. There are some good suggestions, but most of them are just people looking for a way around doing any work.
---
Happened with a lot of games from my own personal experience...
---
Try reading the post next time.
---
my favorite is loading into a nuked whitesprings.    
---
up to a minute of no "nuked" look only to have all the assets finally load to find myself dead from rads..    
---
I've taken to equipping power armor before I log out if possible.
---
You want them to take the game down just to restore an item for you?
---
What successful online games don’t have systems in place to shield new players from being preyed on by high-level players?
---
Doggo iz good boy no hak.
---
Just an average person from an average vault who does average things.
---
Known bug-
---
In build mode, there will an item type called extractors. You can place these down on "resource nodes." They take a while to do it, but they will mine stuff that you can collect for crafting. You also get things like camp plans for successfully defending and/or retaking workshops. However, taking a workshop triggers PvP mode, so other players may come to attack you, sometimes simply because they can (and for the caps you'll lose in the process).
---
Also the price is around 9500 with the perk, but people sell them cheaper. I actually found the small letters by luck somewhere.
---
Nearly burst out laughing when I read this. My first 1-2 weeks of fallout 76 involved not using any power armor at all - once I put it on, I could never exit and was trapped in my suit, unable to craft. I still had a blast. Bethesda has made a great game, and they have already come a very long way. They just need to keep up the good work, and not cave to constant pressure from dummies and noobs to make the -already easy game - even easier.
---
Expand my conversation with u/Solaratov and you'll see how useless debates are.
---
For your ammo suggestion i'd say we have enough MMO magic like teleporting weightless power armor. I'd say it's too easy already. IMO Beth should work on content rather than that because it will never end - it will always be something the forums demand.
---
In my mind i won the debate between you and me, everyone should now agree with me along the same lines of logic, and this should never be an issue on any forum again. Ever.
---
See? I'm just a lightning rod for trolls and flame posts, nothing will ever be resolved, no one is even listening.
---
The MTH plan is a good one to have as the crafting costs are trivial and they sell to vendors for 29 caps.
---
I hear it gives 25% more one handed damage
---
Everytime I see mothman he flys away. I just want a hug...
---
Chopping his cell mate honestly we should probably sit him down 
---
Have you tried the game wearing this?  *points to swimsuit* . . . Wearing ONLY this?
---
You don't understand why someone wouldn't want to be killed by another player while they are playing a game? You don't understand it?
---
Ok honest question. This is like a 90% PVE game. The nerf is because PVP players are getting one shotted. Why is Bethesda pandering to PVP when its such a small percentage? Its hurting the PVE experience. We don't deserve that. Were there not any better options? 
---
You make a valid point. Not sure why you were downvoted to oblivion.
---
I don't care I still want a tse shotty js
---
That's amazing! I love it :) Do you remember where you got the plans for neon letters? 
---
Any luck finding this yet? I examined the ESM and it appears the references to it are not used, so it may not be an item available to drop in the game.
---
I appreciate your stance on the perk cards, but this game is not designed this way. Perk cards are intended to be dynamic and interchangable. No reason for them to not implement load outs. It's a simple qol improvement that would make it more enjoyable, less tedious, and won't impact those that don't want to use it. If you prefer to *choose* to play as a traditional rpg, you can do that, but 76 is not set up that way. I would enjoy it if it was more akin to the older fallouts where you hit 50 and what you picked is what you got and you need a new character if you wanted to change it, but that's just not what this game is.
---
Some suggestions I've seen that I personally think are ridiculous: unlimited carry or stash weight, breaking down legendaries to learn legendary mods, ammo having no weight, having a high level player hub at 76, remove hunger and thirst, a "single player mode," getting rid of PvP completely, making rare loot plentiful to discourage server hopping, restricting nuke zones to level, change special points on a whim, resetting and rolling back everyone's game/character because of dupers
---
please buff energy weapons. 
---
Even raiders should be kind. Dont ruin game to everyone you meet! 
---
You mean like a companion Moo Moo?  :p
---
Because people are idiots and would rather get upset instead of listening to reason.
---
I strongly disagree. I play solo, it feels very much like fallout 4 in a new setting.
---
The only thing different is lack of human NPCs and the presence of other real people in the game.
---
Everything else is 100% Bethesda touch. Right down to the bugs ahaha
---
You get plans from taking workshops, and also can build extractors, besides that they act as free fast travel. Hopefully when private servers are a thing we will be able to take them without losing access when we log off. For now they're a resource dump unless you're playing on a day you can play for long periods of time
---
DOGE:
---
Wow.
---
Such banned.
---
Much exploit.
---
Because people would rather get upset instead of listening to reason.
---
I want an inventory item that is a Tent Camp. Deploys tent, a repair station, cook camp fire, sleeping bag and stash access. That way I can have my big build and something useful for the road. You know...actual camping. LOL
---
Check the subreddit. I’m not the only person whose had things disappear after the patch so it’s obviously an issue. It was a legendary so I couldn’t have scrapped it.
---
Nothing bad even really happens when you die unless you're carrying your life savings in junk.  Look you got down voted by a carebare already.  This Reddit attracts a lot of toxic carebares (new phrase I'm coining lol). Here have an upvote xD
---
Give them your address. They might send a dictionary as a compliment.
---
But how does that affect your play, your game? I understand for PVP servers that might make sense, but PVE? Cmon, the way I play my game ( which I paid for just like you) has no bearing on you. If I want to go 1 shot shit, how is that hurting everyone else? If I want a challenge, I will switch to something else and use 20 bullets to kill something. Still, it is my game and my choice on what I use and how I play. Ditto for you. You can use WHATEVER you want and I could care less because at the end of the day, it is just a game and it will die off just like every other game. Until then, I am going to blow shit up and enjoy it.
---
I never grief, I am always nice to everyone. I do not dupe- but could care less if you do. Why? BECAUSE IT IS YOUR GAME! It has 0 affect on my game. I am 48 years old and use gaming as a "let go of work" past time, and this is exactly what happens in the real world. Snowflakes whine.....and get their way. 
---
I mean this stuff in the nicest way possible :) Just want to give a different perspective.
---
Ha you almost had me fooled thinking there could be such a way. But then I realized that I couldn't possibly do something other than call you a goddamned stupid liar making shit up because that's having healthy spectacle-isms!
---
This is the only one you are missing? You mean the only Delbert's Recipe, or the only Recipe? I think Recipe: Cutting Fluid and Recipe: Cramburger are not in the game. You learn to make Cramburgers from Recipe: Delbert's Bunless Cramburger. The regular "Recipe: Cramburger" doesn't appear to drop in the game either, and you don't learn how to make anything from reading it.
---
Poor little guy.
---
The factions could be the usual responders for builders and raiders for destroyers
---
People like you always cry about a nerf even if its the most reasonable and justified one ever. TS is broken
---
Just go play rd2
---
Or some dog biscuits.
---
I'm just a crazy guy who screams whenever I see other people.
---
You suck at reading comprehension and critical thinking. Try again. 
---
I think there's a known bug where a dropped item doesn't net a bag and a second dropped back won't contain the missing dropped item. I had a legendary gatling that I dropped and it disappeared into the ether. I wasn't too attached to it so it didn't bother me but had this occur with items I tried to drop for a buddy.
---
Now the practice is to drop a piece of junk, target the bag to put more stuff into it.
---
Just go buy rd2
---
Yes now I'm so traumatized from losing in a game :( I can't even play solitaire anymore without having a panic attack.  Millennials know how I feel.  Right guys?
---
it's better than ghoul slayer!
---
I find your lack of faith in impossible weight calculations... disturbing.
---
If you think certain weapons are bad now, next patch they will be completely dead.
---
RIP Pistols. RIP Energy weapons. RIP Most heavy guns and most rifles.
---
Yes, though it also requires a couple of other ingredients. Recipe is a drop from some events, IIRC.
---
There are lots of junk nodes in the wild outside of the workshops, build you camp at it and you need free junk all day long .. junkshops are pvp zones and not guaranteed and disappear when you log off, your camp one stays as long as no one is in your spots. Loads of junk deposits around the map.
---
workshops are just for quick resources, no need to even use them, they great for farming water and resources quickly as well as getting rewards and plans from defending it. But someone can steal it from you and if you try defend it, you going to lose a lot of caps with all the TSE guns out in the wild.
---
Need to get multiple people in on it and have fireworks shows.
---
Fatman Airburst finale!
---
I use this exact same outfit! Pirate and duster!
---
The only way you get to 5k is at such a low health you constantly die. Plus a bobblehead and chems. Which only last for a limited time. Not counting the fact you have to get close enough to use your melee weapon. Imo a nerf isn't required.  
---
problem is i cannot unlock the door on the next stage as i have no key now.
---
any work around?
---
That's all adhesive.  Duct tape FTW
---
Oh yeah it would be right funny 
---
Yea I’m not sure what happened to my weapon. It’s odd though. Other than that the last patch had been amazing.
---
What about cats and frogs?
---
Better with an automatic flare launcher
---
Hi, necroing this post to see if this is still the case?
---
It is viable. With the perks you don't want.
---
I wait
---
At that point it'll weigh 16 tons
---
No. I work
---
/r/unexpectedsimultaneousarcher
---
I think it’ll be instigating, + 50% Crit damage for rifles and furious %25 faster fire rate with 15% reload for autos
---
Well its basically the same on console it throws you to the ps main menu
---
5lb of glue
---
This is it. I have a black powder rifle with 90% reduction. It weighs .6 pounds. I love it. I thought hey a bayonet looks sick as fuck so i put one on. 
---
7 pounds?! For a friggin bayonet?!?! 
---
poor baby
---
Well I guess they wanted to make mutants a primary effect since mutations are new to the series. I agree, 10% seems a little underwhelming.
---
I don't kill the cats (I actually used to mark the Settler housecats as essential in FO4). Don't kill frogs, either. Truth be told, I don't really kill squirrels or rabbits, either.
---
But if it's a level 40+ Radstag then it's going to die. And I once punched a Brahmin to death in Flatwoods just so I could grill a steak.

It warms the cockles of me heart to see another captain venturing forth into wastes unknown!

On one hand, I hate the clapping thing that people do, as you did, but on the other, I will upvote you for your great suggestion. 
---
“......resort to such pathetic means to try and...”
---
.....resort.
---
White springs Resort.
---
I see what you did there lol
---
;D
---
It's a simple concept, you have a workshop I want, I looks for you on the map, I claim your workshop to flag for pvp, i have one of my spotters tell me where you are on the map, about 14 of my comrades port to you and surround you, I turn you into a flaming pile of gibs. 
---
That is how you get the drop on a  player, that is the PVP Bethesda envisioned.This is not the PVP I want, but thats how I have to play it.
---
Arr you on Pc by any chance? 
---
That's not what white knighting is, bud.
---
It makes sense b/c the weight value is also used as a measure of portability.  For example - Say you have a sniper rifle.  Kinda hard to fit into a backpack, yeah?  Separate the barrel, stock, etc, and now you have multiple pieces which fit inside the backpack much better.
---
Is the only response you were looking for, "yes, i agree with your statement?" Because, i think its idiotic to to complain about how a mechanic interacts doesn't fit your personal playstyle, when there are available options that will.
---
What's your build?
---
Super mutants have always been spongy .. only thing that works somewhat well are super sledges .. although I did take down a behemoth with a TSE in about 5 shots with a melee build .. maybe you need a TSE to deal with them
---
Yeah no shit, everyone drops pipe weapons, and frankly they are some of the best weapons in the game. I have a TSE Bolt-Action Pipe Rifle and it took me AGES to find someone selling it, and they were gonna vendor it as crap. It's ridiculously stupid. With my current build a lever action TSE does 1680 damage per shot. Know how much the pipe does? 1530 damage per shot. When you're doing more than 1,500 damage, an extra 150 is TOTALLY insignificant, and for that I have a rifle that NEVER breaks, cost two less perks for that same unbreakability, is WAY cheaper to repair even if it did break, can use WAY cheaper and more common ammunition, has a clip size 1 greater than the lever action, and instead of reloading 1 bullet at a time, reloads a clip at a time. It shoots a 'little' slower, but with speed demon the difference is negligable.   
---
I couldn't get a TSE Pipe Rifle, no one has them or sells them, but I did manage to buy an instigating, exploding, 25% AP reduction Pipe Rifle, and that thing decimates with the Tweaked Reciever attached, and can clear a room of enemies like no ones business. It 1 shots almost all enemies except Mirelurk Kings and up, and even then it's only a few extra shots. The only thing that is needed to make EITHER of these rifles the ultimate farming weapon in the game is if they could attach a .50 reciever, and make use of the HUGE ammo reserves you can make for .50s.  
---
Even still, I never have to farm, my weapons never break, I can kill anything in the game solo except the scorchbeast queen, and I have no issues at all for the most part.  
---
As of now explosive is still going to be the best 'second tier' damage perk EXCEPT criticals, and criticals are ONLY better if you spec into them (Assuming you get a critical every other shot that will average out to a 25% damage increase per shot, which will be 5% better than Explosive weapons), as such my Pipe Rifle is still going to be one of the best weapons in the game post patch, I just need to get a bolt action with bloodied explosive, and frankly I know everyone is vendoring them, which sucks, and I think they're idiots.  
---
I'll pay 5-10k caps for a bloodied explosive pipe/bolt-action rifle, so don't throw that shit away!
---
The in game chat is so quiet compared to party chat. We run in party chat because of this. I’ll switch to game chat to say hi to new players but then switch back. 
---
And what lies beyond it! Though explosive weapons take no prisoners. 🤷‍♀️
---
This too. I actually found a ultraite laser rifle very early game, but havent touched as I know theyre under powered and that if the enemy turns to ash I might not be able to loot it.. which is annoying as hell.
---
Just don't open your pipboy during this, you'll soft-lock and have to force quit.
---
If the force a character reroll, then I think the new PVP mode should also have a level cap.   Otherwise, you will have level 50  characters who have been playing for days on the same map with level 1 characters who have been playing for one hour, who have no hope of ever catching up. 
---
In that situation, the level 1 character is level 50 days later, but the level 50 guy has gotten up to level 80. 
---
Also, I think it's being abused by griefers. I don't actually know when you start taking damage, but I have multiple times been loading in while someone stands next to the spawn point and hits me. They fast traveled away once I started moving, the one I followed was doing the same thing again when I fast traveled to his location. I suspect they're trying to kill players before they can fully load into the game, but to be honest I'm not sure if it works or not.
---
 I have a 90% reduced weight Gauss Rifle and it weights 16 lbs.

---
If you got the raider key drop, and its in your inventory, can you proceed to the next step in the quest chain?  If it will not let you proceed with roses quest, then you have an issue. 
---
**Is it only asking you to kill the wendigo with a clown outfit on?** That is a repeatable quest, and will reappear every time you log on. 
---
The separate server part is crucial.
---
Most of anything is nowadays.
---
Ride the Lightning by Metallica. 
---
I saw a thread from before the patch was implemented on the PC wondering if it was going to fix the issue for the PC.  It’s interesting that it is happening for both the Xbox and the PS4 now. It may have been happening before, but it just wasn’t happening to me.
---
Considering death has basically 0 consequences (especially if you get in a habit of dumping junk  in your stash frequently) difficulty isn't really a concern to begin with.
---
Not to mention the fact that dying is actually encouraged in some cases. If you have radiation, dying cuts it in half. Save some radaway and jump off a cliff a few times after you've stashed your junk.
---
So, it's funny to bar out legitimate means of play that aren't being exploited to you then?
---
They need to offer a full respec

Does the Energy Ammo weight reduction perk apply to the fusion cores? Was wondering this last night but didn't want to burn a level up to find out.

Idea - pip boy menu with text list of near fast travel points sorted by price. Also free travel points, favorited points, and alternate targets for unopened workshop travel.

Nothing weighs 16 tons, except for No.9 Coal.

I've had 3-4 gatling plasmas now and about the same amount of plasma rifles.

Actually scored a TS plasma rifle at Whitesprings last night too!
---
But by your examples I am still stuck with 2 steps. Plus, you say that what happens when a player doesn't have the correct currency? Then they can't buy what I have. To me, selling a weapon for 1000 5.56 means caps are a chicken. Still not what I want. I am forced to trade the chicken or caps for something I want. I should say that in the Tabula Rasa system there were thousands of entries so it was easy to find something that you could pay for. You could also say you have 1000 caps and want X for them as well. The reason I want to avoid caps is because a caps based systems locks out many players until prices stabilize (diablo- looking at you) or maybe, since you can buy caps on ebay, prices will never stabilize. So as a player who doesnt have many caps, there may be some other ways to pay for things because I simply can't compete with those that are capped out and it would be nice to play versus trying to maximize cap runs each time I am on.
---
It's 2102, we eat ass. 
---
Nope, Queen will stay the same forcing every range user to either swap to a bloodied build or swap to a melee build.
---
Also never go back to your camp if someone is following you. Make sure you block them asap so they can't see where your camp is.
---
I run a 1-star 2shot 10mm sub and it is glorious.  Works beautifully with my crit build and feels like it hits fairly hard.  Not sure what I am going to move onto with the Nerf.  Probably look for +crit dam, fire rate, and something.
---
I'm a terrible person. when I see a critter I look to see if I have any grenades or mines in my inventory. I've got a lvl 50 bunker buster with accumulated missiles from the harper's ferry roof that I'll be carrying around for this purpose 6 levels from now.
---
Ghoul Slayer is really good in nuke zones actually
---
I have noticed many changes cores, food, and water. BGS probably used hot Fixes to adjust game . I’ve had several long term players comment last night in particular
---
Its coming, we should have separate pvp and pve servers by the end of the month. we not sure if existing servers will remain the same, more than likely, but maybe the hardcore pvp players will move onto the pvp servers.
---
OMEGALUL
---
Well they're called suggestions for a reason.
---
Also I dunno about you, but most suggestions I see make a lot of sense, like the 8000000 suggestions to make plans you know be marked as learned before you buy/grab them or the one where you would be able to convert vault 76 into a marketplace/ah for players to list up their valuables to trade, those make a lot of sense.
---
Other then that I haven't seen any other suggestions that turn on the easy mode on.
---
bloodied is the new TSE
---
Stuff I've been thinking about since the start of the game. Even before the game came out actually.... I really was thinking and hoping that we were going to have a game where rebuilding in the wasteland was going to be a pivotal feature. It is a theme of the game and selling taglines and everything out of game and in game. That was one thing I have been most disappointed about. I'm not really interested in an mmo eternal big monster dungeon grind or DayZ pvp simulator. I'm more interested in story, lore, npc interactions/faction growth, building, and aidng a server and making community.
---
Drug addicts can't give up a bad habit, either ;)
---
Wait?  They're nerfing TS/TSE weapons?  This is the first I heard of it (sarcasm font)
---
Yeah I think it’s something specific to me the way I have my character built or my inventory or something.  I have a supersledge out all the time and I am running around in X-01 armor, with a jet pack and marsupial, and the speed mutations.  I wonder if that has anything to do with it.
---
He DOES have a unique headpiece. Or maybe you're shooting him in the back? Must be why Super Mutants are so hostile, we don't play fair
---
I mean they basically just need to tune down the spongeyness of the enemys. Its insane.
---
My personal playstyle is to always have mutations because fuck not having marsupial.
---
That's not relevant to this post.
---
I'm saying that for a main effect on a legendary it's kinda silly to have one that is only applicable to certain characters whereas they have a secondary effect that's BETTER than that while still giving the same bonus only it works with everyone.
---
Sorry that you assumed something incorrectly.
---
I do the same when pulled into party chat. I'm with you about the game chat being quiet. I wish there was a way to hear both without having to switch.
---
THIS is the thread that will make a difference though! /s

I think I was in the one with you on Xbox, most fun I’ve had taking down a Queen yet as well!!

yes pleeeease
---
Have you ever held a middle launcher?
---
grahm needs his own outfit they could give him the bear outfit Erikson has in far harbor if they dont want to make him him a new outfit
---
If it produced only 20 an hour like he said, I can easily kill a few enemies or complete an event in less time and get more caps.

THIS.  I'm waiting for the scorch queen too hard posts so I can refer back to this comment lol

You just described an every day problem of mine.

Bloodied Melee is the 3 shot explosive you didnt know existed.

nope the key has gone, char borked?

No this is what I do, but I find most people couldn't care less about workshops now days, only a few bored people, I mostly abandon my workshops and people still don't grab them ..
---
Board with nails is just cheap to repair and make.  I use that build to level up toons.  It's easier, fast and cheap.
---
When I was a lower level hanging out in my CAMP, another higher level player comes chasing after a Scorched. The higher level just eats this dead Scorched right next to me! I have never seen anyone use the cannibal perk, so it scared the crap out of me! 
---
That's no joke. I noticed this a while back and long barrel almost everything for that reason.
---
its not even the gun's base weight. i posted this same issue on their forums with a break down of a short handmade with the same mods as the 3star legendary i have with 90% weight reduction. Its all sorts of fucked. Probably because Bethesda.

Yeah. Then it mutes the whole party for me to talk to someone in game. Ah well. Then I’ll switch to in game and no one hears me anyway because they too are in party chat. LOL
---
I know for a fact that the Brotherhood does not. Towards the end &gt;!there is a holotape in Elder Maxon's room. I believe it's called "The Nuclear Option". Maxon says that they will not use nukes as an option because it's what got them in this mess in the first place. That there has to be another way.!&lt; I thought it was pretty cool lore. Free States? I'm not sure, they just seemed more about survival for themselves and their neighbors.
---
I'm game if you've got a decent team lining up and no shed dwellers!
---
And this isn't your fault that the game is horrible at notifying people that they can be murdered in their sleep and have their wallet stolen.  Basically as it stands now it gives 'raiders' a license to kill and most of the people they are stalking have no idea how or why the are lambs to the slaughter.  By all means keep abusing this missunderstood mechanic in the game (which is obviously so since you had to go out of your way to post a topic on reddit and most of the responses are like gee I never knew this).  However, until the GAME actually makes this clear, you are still just murdering helpless people who have no idea why you were able to murder them.  You will STILL get this same response from people until the game gets better at explaining this.  If you wanted to actually spread the word more though you should get a mic, explain to the person exactly what is going on.  THEN murder them.  
---
I agree with this, and I have always thought this in any game that has both crafting and these kinds of items. 
---
First, it would be great if crafting made items that while lacking the special abilities were offered something better. In short options. 
---
Crafted weapons have better stats. Legendary items have unique abilities. Now it becomes a choice. Do you want better damage, range, accuracy and durability, or do you want reduced/increased damage against certain creatures? Or any of the other unique things Legendaries do.
---
Or like you have suggested. We can create Legendaries. Mods, or using unique materials gathered from the creatures of the wastelands. 
---
Either way, when you have something like this, Legendaries always win because they are always better. And they seem to common in FO76. 
---
...you worked my character in to your backstory &lt;3
---
Thats the problem. We shouldnt HAVE to move on to something else after a weapon nerf. That just tells you how underpowered it really is. I want to keep my smg :(
---
fo76 is a bad game that's the only explanation you need.
---
go back to cave, find key on dead raider body hidden in the corner, continue.
---
Wendigo is just the distractor, the key is on a corpse.
---
This would also be an ideal location to offer a full respect for caps/atoms.
---
I also wouldn't mind seeing them add an in game atom store that you could wander around and see the items in game to buy.
---
Can't wait until they release fallout 76 sandbox mode so you guys can endlessly collect junk and build bases and stuff without any bad guys coming to disturb you and 0 threats to your safety /s
---
There's a reason it's a wasteland survival sim. It supposed to be dangerous. Be killed in pvp is not the same as being griefed. Now if someone followed you around the whole server killing you every time destroying you based etc. That is being griefed but there are already method in place for that.
---
My wife's PC game comm's are totally broken. I bought her a new USB mic and the OS sees it and it works but when in the game it doesn't matter what I have the setting at she can't talk to anyone or hear anyone. On our XBOX games we both use the party function, didn't even try the in game comm's. 
---
I agree the hub should be somewhere else. That way it’s not locked behind a lvl cap and doesn’t conflict with new players. It would also fit the “rebuilding” aspect better. 
---
Also, a separate server is crucial for a player hub. Bump the player count up in the hub world. Add factions, add plots of land for players to set up shops, incentivize said shops, etc.
---
Bethesda could even get away with adding a hub world this late in the game because technically there wouldn’t be an established hub world on reclamation day... BOOM, head canon. 
---
But the weight would be the same still
---
*in robot voice*  A NOTE TO THE GOURMANDS
---
The warlords are particularly the issue. Behemoths are rare and should be a challenge, every super mutant spawn I get has at least 5 warlords. All sponges, all without any rewarding loot.
---
A regular modern day wordsmith and whatnot, thank you thank you.
---
But yes, it’s also a day to day problem for myself.
---
Honestly the Mutants effect is a good idea but should be changed.  Reduce the base effect from 10% to 5%, but, make it so that it can stack upto 5 times, so if you have 5 mutations, the item has a 25% bonus instead of the just flat 10%, kind of make it a trade off, where you have to mutate yourself alot to fully utilize the power of it.
---
I'd also like to see them change some things in the mutations so that a number of mutations are mutually exclusive, like Marsupial and Egghead, or Unstable Isotope and the Electrozap one, etc.
---
Nice idea!  Simple enough to add small varieties too.  Re-build a farm involves plants, fertilizers and water; results in a patch of available crops at that area.  Re-build military location involves turrets, barricades, and ammo; resulting in an operating safe zone that nearby enemies won't be able to successfully attack. 
---
awesome, thx for the response!
---
Or just get rid of the combining mechanics and let us use 3 of the same card for the rank 3 perk
---
What platform? I'm on xbox and may have a right leg.
---
Wasn’t much of a problem in FO4 where you aren’t limited to a paltry 600lbs of loot. Nothing I hate more than having to choose between my 20lb hunting rifle and my 20lb minigun, because I only have room for one in my stash. 
---
Good, I like it too.
---
I don't like Bethseda very much atm though. 
---
Anyway you agreed w what I said and that was my only point. Wasn't saying a thing about liking or hating the game. Just commenting on the comment. 
---
If you're out wandering around the west side of the map solo......I can guarantee you that you wouldn't care at all if someone has a cheesy 1 shot kill weapon because not wouldn't effect you.
---
The only people crying about weapon Nerfs are PvP players and the ones missing out on getting a hit in on a legendary before that one guy one shot kills it.
---
dammit, what I said had nothing to do with what you were talking about.  Forgive me, I'm slow.  I think you make very valid points here.  Especially your points about durability.  
---
The only point of contention I have is that I think what is a bigger problem with damage (now that TSE weapons will get fixed) is that you can punch a lvl 62 charred ghoul 2-3 times with a tamborine and kill it, but it takes... I don't even know how many bullets to put them down. And this is with 3 perk points spent in melee damage, vs. 9 perk points spent in rifles.
---
I don't really think people would hate the game nearly as much if Bethesda didn't keep screwing up over and over. It is really fun, but the number of times I've crashed after spending materials on a workshop or am nearly done with a quest and have to go back to the beginning of the cave or wherever the quest is makes it way less fun.
---
I hope they iron out the camp bugs soon. The one that's been getting me lately is the one about part of the camp being inaccessible if removing a piece despite that not being the case.
---
Just like the Giants in Skyrim.....  right up until you need them toes for alchemy...
---
True but right now after the nerf announcement ppl are extra childish.
---
Wait...what? 
---
Still not nerfed yet, but would always depend on your platform. On xbox they are massss duped so super cheap
---
On the second note, I really hope another stash increase is coming soon. I'm running out of room all the time again.
---
I will give that a try tonight, cheers!
---
Try tap-firing it. Even without martial artist and/or speedy receiver, you can get a substantially faster fire rate (and even more accuracy) by doing so. You have to get the rhythm right, though. This doesn't seem to work with aiming down sights, but that thing is super accurate even hip-fired if you're using stabilized.
---
People get really mad at fights when you start doing your impression of an artillery strike with the auto grenade launcher.  The actual strike I called in mere seconds later seemed anticlimactic
---
Because buffing creates an endless arms race which makes balancing the game impossible 
---
But then those weapons are still far behind the others either way.
---
Complaining is a vital mechanism that influences innovation. Except complaining about complaining. That really is useless.
---
I guess bolt action might be ok. I just like the black powder pistol for the theme.
---
I am Santa Claus, leader of the Responders.  Being an immortal being, I survived the nukes, and came to America to help rebuild and make sure others stay warm and happy during this prolonged nuclear winter.
---
I will try that thanks 
---
It's health does not, just resistances;maybe they should scale with player levels rather than just number of players
---
Same - My first toon was a melee build and she has no melee specific dmg skills.  She just uses incisor and martial artist (+adrenaline and bloody mess) and she can literally cake walk everything except the queen - until she lands.
---
I've seen people defend the nerfs to event xp and Whitesprings xp because of "THE GRIND!". Rather than buff weak weapons, people want everything nerfed. People attack people for wanting some sort of perk loadout saying you shouldn't be able to "min/max" in this game. People say they like the "realism" of item durability and the constant need to eat and drink and then go on to defend the low stash and carry weight, and the weight of guns being so high.
---
If all that isn't tedious, I don't know what is. 
---
Not attacking you, but there is some downside in PvE. When I'm trying to get xp/items during a nuke in whitesprings but im unable to bc a handful of guys are one-shotting all of the ghouls before I can get any damage to them
---
You kinda took their workshop, so they lost more than just junk, they lost time / materials and caps.
---
I understand workshops are meant to be taken and raided aswell, the only time I see a problem is when a lvl 50+ takes it away from someone &lt; lvl 40. The lower lvl really cant do much to get it back or sometimes doesnt understand the pvp flagging rules with workshops.
---
If your capping workshops just to force pvp, pick on someone at your lvl not someone who cant fight back. I understand the Raider RP point of view, but if there is no challenge to the encounter is it even fun?
---
If you really want a workshop and your not tied to that server, ie have other workshops claimed, just swap servers. If the player is 50+ or is on the east side of the map than have at them, but its kind of a jerk move capping a lvl 15-30s workshop in the forest and forcing them to waste more of their limited reasources and caps.
---
Carebear* or was the spelling error intentional?
---
Come on, you don't get to put your camp far out of the way and then expect it to be a bustling shop.
---
It's my game indeed. You would have agreed with my post, then. Sadly, it got removed by a mod.
---
Basically, I dupe and stack Explosive bobbleheads to one-shot everyone who comes into Grafton.
---
My game, my fun. I'm sure it doesn't affect them whatsoever.
---
Ark, WoW, Ultima Online.
---
Me too, I already have a pipe weapons character anyways. 
---
Glowing meat steak + Yao guai ribs + Mutant hound chops = omega stacked food buff, and add a Deathclaw Steak to that and you've got extra strength to boot. I've been saving up and sorting through all of the food in the game to make sure I at least two or three shot big things.
---
I do wonder if carnivore increases those food buffs howerver.
---
Also a fair point. How yea people are overreacting... I mean I understand, but damn.
---
25-50% is fair. sure, TSE is OP, but it's also not supposed to be as prominent as it is either. it's supposed to be powerful, but rare. thank dupers for that.
---
alternatively, i think the nerf should be for PvP and not include PvE if it's going to be that intense. or make it +50% for PvE and keep it +20/25% for PvP. i might have even preferred if two shot and explosive couldn't be combined. nerfing the effects might keep TSE from being OP, but it now also makes my regular two-shot weapons significantly worse, and they really were not putting in work like that in the first place. my main rifle rn is a two shot handmade, and it's *alright* as is. it's better than rifles I can build, but not by much. this update will essentially make it no better than a gun I can build myself. i guess i save some ammo that i can build a shit ton of anyway? the last thing we need is more mediocre legendaries to take on the hoards of bullet sponges. this just makes legendaries and grinding even less rewarding.
---
What are the requirements for it?
---
gud luck.
---
Ah ok. There's alot of trash guns out there unfortunately.
---
Two shot or not, they need to be looked at.
---
x2 damage isn't a fix in my eyes because it makes the strong weapons rediculous.
---
No worries! I didn’t talk to Rose til I was level 65! 
---
The assault rifle looks like a Lewis gun so they probably got the weights on that right fucker is about 20 pounds loaded 
---
Yea and I almost wonder if this is a cheeky challenge from Bethesda. I mean, people get excited playing Skyrim for 1,000 hrs. I can’t imagine actually playing 7600 hrs. 
---
Level 159, TSE Combat Shotty....Lets drop this bitch.
---
Energy guns and Pistols need buffs either way.
---
I wish it gave the server a notification so that it encouraged people to claim workshops. 
---
200 caps for all (25+ )
---
For 750 atoms it will weigh 21
---
Depends on what other players are in the area that's triggering the spawns and unfortunately that's an area where there's a pretty wide range of who is hanging around due to the vendors.  I'd server jump until you find no one high level is hanging around and then give it another go.
---
LOL......
---
Yeah sure everyone wants an endless grind that's why so many people camp out at Whitesprings killing endless swarms of ghouls.
---
Of course not. People are playing the penny slots at Whitesprings because they want to avoid the grind.

I'm honestly not sure if you're trying to troll me or are being serious. You seem really worked up for some reason? and that other post you tagged me in further reinforces that you're either trolling or delusional.
---
Use the right tools for the situation. 
---
A whole bunch. I’m not sure. I just wanna get rid of them
---
My suggestion is to add more end game and fix drops (3star from queen). Is that so bad?
---
Was she by any chance wearing a Garb of Mysteries?
---
Hmmm not bad
---
I want them for the challenges for the Atom Points.
---
You really disliked 4? How the hell...
---
I mean, I get it... not really.
---
I play as The Dude. I pretty much just abide.
---
Yup, and see, I've got all the tapes, an completed the chal, but the quest won't complete
---
It would be cool if you could see other people's perks and trade equal value perk cards. 
---
Then they would be like actual trading cards too. 
---
Yes please by all means take them. 
---
Well I held out for so long but I guess it's time to make a melee build now.
---
bugged, only for chest pieces, expect fix and plan ahead.
---
Yup I can agree with all this. Not sure why two shot is caught up in the mix. I hope they rethink the decision. 
---
I spotted it when I was looting the Treehouse. 
---
It will still be the strongest kind of gun outside of bloody build ones.
---
No other perks add 20 and 25 percent damage.
---
Tbh its value is low now and after the nerf it will go back up as people are overreacting completely.
---
You scary.
---
Great build. I recommend swapping out psychopath for crit savvy. I think you'll be huge improvement in the amount of crits you get. Especially against mobs you can't one shot.
---
Sadly no it looks like we will not be experiencing the deliciousness of those Chitlins con carne for some time :-(
---
I'm a 2 handed melee, your build is pretty close to mine. Question though, any idea if the glowing meat better than the deathclaw steaks? Glowing meat is +10% melee, and i believe deathclaw steaks are +2 to strength. Not sure what strength scales to per point for damage.
---
Mutations: caly skin, grounded, 
---

---
I also use ricochet 
---
Gear all mutants  on all 5 pieces which is 50 
---
BOS heavy comabat armor, dense mod on chest  to increase explosive resistance. 
---
I could make a in depth post of my build today.
---
So, melee is getting to the point where it’s so far ahead on the race track that you can’t even see the car anymore. Awesome job Bethesda, the guns that should be the most devastating sustained dps, the gattling laser, 50cal, and Minigun, are worthless. And the heaviest hitting weapons, grenade launchers, missile launchers, and fat boys, are already a joke. Great job Bethesda, push out even more players. 
---
How about complaining about a lack of complaining? Or moreover, if you complain about complaining and it leads to a lack of complaining and henceforth a lack of innovation and therefore needs to be complained about, which leads to complaining about complaining.
---
I think in the end it boils down to choices. Problem with current system is, there are no choices, not really. You can go from "I can't even pick my nose" to "I can pick any lock in the game!" by slotting 3 1-star cards. You can go from "Silos are so damn difficult." to "Silos are too damn easy!" by slotting a single 3-star card (Robotics Expert). The only thing in the game right now even beginning to approach choice is the SPECIALs, but given how generous the margins are, even that's not much of a problem. Highest tier card is 5-star, SPECIALS go up to 15, so you can be literally anything with 1/3rd of the SPECIAL invested. That's too broad, makes choices meaningless.
---
Nope, also the accuracy debuff will stay just as stronk.
---
wait, live fast and eat ass? lmao
---
I'm saying that the value labeled 'weight' is being used as a stand-in for both weight and volume.

At least the giants put up a better fight (they were tougher than dragons).
---
Thats 5lbs of glue screws and springs bitch
---
Yeah, that would be a cool thing to see: underused weapons having a very specialized purpose to end-game content like that. Now I feel like we absolutely need a massive honeybeast hive dungeon with a queen as the boss
---
Legendaries do that sometimes...Chasing down a deathclaw sucks...
---
BSS was always superior to TSE for damage, though
---
Yeah, my character looks a bit like Joseph Seed or 'The Father' from Far cry 5
---
I wouldn't go about maybe 2-3k right now regardless of platform.
---
I'm curious, why do you hate f4?
---
I have one helmet. Although it's really just a mask not a helmet. I'm curious about the actual combat helmet.
---
At this point, the way I look at it is less of a "what did I gain" and think of it kind of like a casino, yes I am losing money but I am gaining fun
---
They will still be effective, but not as much for pure damage as for AoE.
---
If each pellet gets +25% damage against one target, that's just +25% damage.  It's the splash that is nice.  It will be interesting to see if that splash damage is 125% (all damage from the pellet converted to explosive) or just the 25% from the legendary.
---
Phone autocorrect causes 99% of spelling errors since it refuses to acknowledge acronym or phrases I use lol.  
---
Anyway, y'all act like this is real life sometimes.  It's not a "jerk move" to own boardwalk in monopoly and take the other players money that they spent time getting.   It is a game and it's how the game works.  Literally you are asking to take the adrenaline inducing element out of the game and have everyone voluntarily just not participate in the pvp aspects of it.   I've never taken someone's workshop so don't think I just disagree with you because I love trolling people.  I have had my base attacked and I enjoyed defending it.  I enjoy this game mechanic and that's why I'm here.  I would not be mad if you or that guy attempted to take my workshop.  (I hate monopoly but you don't see me trying to change monopoly rules on the monopoly Reddit either)
---
Right. You don't understand. We get it man. It's hyper obvious that not understanding how and why other people feel things is right in your wheelhouse. It seems like this game attracts people who don't seem to understand other humans. 
---
It isnt nerfed yet
---
But it's a massive part of West Virginia's history
---
I had a legendary glowing deathclaw hide behind a bus at whitesprings the other day. Literally ran away and hid any time it saw me.. I ended up sniping it's tail to kill it. 
---
I paid good caps to robot vendors for an explosive smg with troubleshooters affix and +1 to agility, and an explosive light machine gun with vampire effect and + 1 to perception.
---
Does anyone know if these were likely duped and/or be nerfed?
---
I hate it too, but I was posting in the middle of the night and it just seemed appropriate
---
It doesnt have any downsides anyway right?
---
Springs, screws, wood, and leather from the toy... Where is this place? I must farm it.

I always fight deathclaws with melee tbh. I don't like wasting ammo on bullet sponges

I had to login just to comment on this. Im trying to articulate this in a way that doesn't offend anyone....
---
Some of you sound like a bunch of pussies. Its a god damn video game. Blow it up. Shoot it. Fuck it. Drink it. Swallow it. Nuff' said. Merica'
---
I think saying it’s wrong because you want to farm other players’ caps at a public event is an argument **for** keeping it the way it is.

Buffing everything to 1 shots is rediculous.
---
And you roll a new character if you want to fully change your build.
---
What gun is it? Do you have adrenal reaction mutation? Could the 1100 damage be from the adrenaline perk card giving a damage buff?
---
I don't think so. You even get more range out of it too.
---
Yup. 100% agree.

---
I don’t have a TSE but I think I’m gunna disagree with u about the Queen fight. I literarily just watched 2 people with TSE Handmades kill the Queen in less than 5 minutes. By themselves!
---
The Queen fight should take 8 people like it recommends. 8 high level, end game gear players. And even then it should be at least a 10 minutes fight. She’s not hard already and TSE and Bloodied weapons make her a joke.
---
yeah OP has it backwards
---
*Ore is lore*
---
 Thats true. They need to do a little of both then in my opinion.
---
Yeah that's the actual reason but this is a joke shit post so take your logic and upvote and get outtaaaa here. Besides, Ultracite didn't actually need to be part of the story, they just wanted to add onto WV's mining history. Just commenting that we don't actually get much lore besides about the setting, and only a little of that
---
It’s amazing how we lived on 400... and I’m dying on 600
---
Is it big enough and, if so, would it be problematic to increase the size? (Non programmer here)
---
I’m not sure, I just built a new camp two days ago and I walked back and forth over 5 of them at a time without an issue. 
---
I agree that enemies at high level are just bullet sponges, and that's why TSE weapons were popular too. Now if they want to fix the sponginess they can reduce the health or armor of all the mobs, effectively buffing all weapons. So we needed a nerf to TSE before a buff accross the board or TSE would be even more OP. 
---
&gt;Melee: get a few perk cards, max out strenght, get a slow speed weapon. Two shot scorchbeast.ranged: put 14 points just into your weapons damage, get a high end legendary, suppress it, still takes 30 shots.want to know what is worse, the fact the NPC's are bullet sponges, ranged isn't worth it when 130 damage takes 1/15th of a targets health from stealth. (crossbow).Sure I can take out a level 22 wendigo with 5 shots of a lever action, or I could go melee and oen shot it. Ranged is not worth it.And nerfing melee is not the answer.... well the two shot the scorchbeasts needs fixed but it feels good to play melee, it doesn't feel good to play ranged. Except when using the flamer but ammo for that is so rare it isn't worth it anyway.

WTF, that wasn't click bait that auto delete needs deleted. 
---
I'm perpetually overencumbered in this game, between ammo, parts, a handful of weapons, and some consumables I'm never less than 15 pounds or so under the carry weight limit on a good day. On a bad one I'm spending huge amounts of time slowly trekking across Appalachia.
---
Talk about TSE have been a hot subject here before yesterday’s Inside the Vault.
---
There’s nothing to say they are or aren’t going to make adjustments to melee.
---
They just addressed a subject that has more attention to let us know they are reading and hearing us.
---
I asked this once before and someone said "they can't be legendary if they rush in and die"
---
Interesting.  
---
same, and regardless of nerf
---
It's all of my guns but the one that does 1100 damage is the TSE Guass rifle and I don't have the mutation or any diseases
---
Ms. Handy?
---
That's a fair point, but its also very situational. It's 1 place on the map that's good for farming, so of course a lot of people with explosive weapons are going to show up. 
---
I agree, its a dick move to just mow down every ghoul with explosive weapons, I only do that if shit really hits the fan. I always try to let all get a hit in, I go melee in nuke zones. 
---
My point is, since it's so situational, it really shouldn't hurt people who just enjoy using explosive weapons as an "oh-shit!-weapon".

Went through launch complex bravo entered my code after using my key card. After target selection and confirmation my character was shown from the targeting kiosk and a quest completed or started death from above and while that began to appear on my screen my game froze and ejected me to a blue screen. When I started the game up again I was placed in a different server but my keycard was taken. I reran the bravo silo and got to the keypad and my access was locked for 2hrs and 5 minutes. I contacted a friend to come into the silo and launch the nuke for me he had to use his own key card and finally we launched the nuke to fissure site prime and the other fissure site to fissure site primes west. During the fight of the scorch queen my frame rate was absolutely horrible I could barely move and couldn't open my pipboy, my character in third person would go invisible and become visible this is while I had power armor on. When I went first person I could see my weapons. During the fight looting was impossible along with targeting enemies without vats. This was the worst scorch beast queen encounter I've had idk what happened but it was really bad. I tried taking cellphone video I'm not the best cameraman but I got about 3 minutes of it I believe. When I get to work I'll do my best to upload it for you guys. It's just really tough to play sometimes I really like this game but please please fix this stuff.

Actually, you don't have to connect two passthroughs directly, there are straight conduits you can run from the inside portion, to another passthrough, if you're trying to get power from one side of a room to the outside of another. Makes it look a little nicer IMO.
---
Great suggestion.  Thank you!
---
Yeah, we know
---
They arent horribly rare, they do suck though.
---
Bringing other weapons up to speed with TSE would have been the better solution. This way people can play the game how they like and not just try and fit the TSE weapons meta. Now everyone will just want to revert back to melee since it'll surpass any range build.
---
And other weapons have long been wayyyy undertuned and i don't see how it would create an "arms race". Lol this isn't some political game.
---
That's kinda why this thread was started from what I can tell, to get a clear answer on it
---
Agreed with rifle perks. I can't use any other fun Perception perks because my points are taken by the various Rifleman. Just like I can't use any fun Strength perks when I have to use Strong Back, Traveling Pharmacy, and Pack Rat. I can't use the fun laser and plasma weapons for durability and dps reasons, and I'm really wondering if Gunsmith really works for energy weapons (if it does, that's even more sad). These are more complaints of mine than desires to fix things, since I chose my development path leveling up. But man, once you're slotted into place, it's really hard to change.
---
No way!!!!!
---
Its old news though... 
---
You don’t have to use a full set for the effect to work. Mix them up. +45 of one and +30 of the other on top of +40% for a full assassins brings you to 85 and 70% while running and standing. There’s no reason to go for a full set with fireproof and the upcoming nerf to TS and E. 
---
Let's try staying on topic, shall we? I'm asking about pricing, not for your boohoo sob story.
---
Is the artillery strike very effective on her? I tried to pop it out on her in the last fight but I had trouble with the camp budget due to a plant duplication bug when I moved the camp. 
---
That’s dishonestly ignoring the various methods to uh, let’s call it “convince” players to enter PvP with you. And really wanted players are wanted because they engaged in a willingness to mess with others. It’s reasonable to assume a wanted player in an event is up to no good. And if they do get killed, so what? Lose a few caps and you’re good. Now you aren’t wanted, do the event.
---
This isn’t dark souls. Direct comparisons are really not appropriate. As someone who implies they played, I would have thought you’d understand that.
---
I have found that if you remove the pieces in the order you placed them it seems to go smoothly. Be sure to store/scrap and lights, conduit, posters etc... first. 
---
What's the second loading screen? For the most part, I just get a normal loading screen, spawn in, wait a few seconds, can move around, and then finally everything gets loaded in.
---
Though I have been getting this ([https://imgur.com/a/bMqkMQO](https://imgur.com/a/bMqkMQO)) lately, maybe since last patch(?), where first I get the normal loading screen, but then it gets replaced with a frame rendered with a large amount of stuff missing for a few seconds.
---
So every time I load in by Phoenix in Watoga, I get the city is screaming at me.
---
I only give to those who are nice.  And to those who are naughty, well let's just say you better watch out, cuz I'm comin to town.
---
I use it for ninja-capping workshops by using chameleon and this pose, they generally have a hard time finding me. :&gt;
---
They are making a new fallout game! It's called Fallout 76.
---
what is this?
---
We do this too when playing multiplayer.  It's frustrating because now we can't voice interact with anyone else in-game.  However the audio chat features within the xbox version are bugged and don't work properly. I wish they'd fix that.
---
XD it seems like this game also attracts people who don't understand the premise of the game and get hurt feelings when pvp takes place. 
---
But please keep implying I'm a bad person for enjoying the game as it was made.
---
Again super psyched for PVE mode for you guys so you can feel safe in your post apocalyptic game where everyone works together for the common good 
---
But just so you feel better most of the people who enjoy PVP will migrate away from the regular mode which will leave less bad guys for you to worry about.
---
&gt; Buffing everything to 1 shots is rediculous.
---
No one is asking for that. 
---
&gt; And you roll a new character if you want to fully change your build.
---
Wouldn't be such an issue if a lot of end game stuff wasn't gated behind the story. Just don't feel like repeating the samething again.
---
Err i 1 shot most enemies with my gun guy.
---
I actually drop multiple enemies way faster with chained vats crits.
---
I just found out today lol 
---
Yes, but I won't be able to log on for another 6 hours after work.
---
Just found out today lol 
---
You sure?
---
Well I’m sorry to hear you can’t understand it. Have a good day yourself.
---
?
---
Really? You heard about all the nerf drama with tse’s right? Still wanna ride that train?
---
Oh, or are you investing in a potential market gap for after the patch? Enquiring minds etc.
---
Yup, hell, the lmg (it's really an MG42) is fun as shit to use, it sounds good, handles well if you control your fire well (wish we could deploy it's bipod) but it's damage is so god damn anemic due to rof, and it's got half the mag size of the ma duece (.50 mg) and about half the damage per shot, while being a fairly expensive cartridge to make
---
Call them.. The reason 90% of the remaining die hard and most patient player base just left.
---
Thanks man!
---
I think it's Pig Foot Pete
---
ok i wanna look like 'The Father' tell me how. Please.
---
Weird, I didnt know the words "Really" and "Cool" are just place holders for the letter 'S'
---
It's under your side quests "Follow the Overseers Journey"
---
Thats pretty good
---
I havent had the issue on xbox. Maybe u just got used to it that you killed that many. And now you do less effort? 
---
True, but most events are just "TP here and kill these 5 things." Except some reward you, most do not.
---
If a person considered it fun, wouldn't it be easier and identical fun to stay where you are and kill 5 things, equally without reward? 
---
Buffing is occasionally the right option, but only for things that are below the intended power level of players. There is a developer intended power we can get to, and some room for minmaxing that takes us above it, but some things that need nerds are just way too far out of that acceptable range. TS/E abilities are way out of line with other legendaries and need to be adjusted down. 
---
Both explosive and TS are an approximately 100% increase in damage. Neither has a real consequence to use. For comparison:
---
Bloodied, the only larger damage boost of up to 150%, requires a perk setup to support low HP, running high rads, and generally being a glass cannon because you are weak as hell. 
---
Instigating, which gives 100% boost only on first hit, is limited in that it doesn’t work if the enemy is missing any health. It gives the same boost TS gives, but TS works all the time. 
---
Hunter/Slayer mods give a 30% but only to certain enemy types. Significantly less than either TS or E.
---
Executioners gives +50%, but only to targets below 40% health. Again, half the bonus of TS and it’s conditional. 
---
Mutants/while aiming give +10% for more passive bonuses.
---
These legendaries are all pretty close in relative power, with bloodied being an outlier if you build correctly and have an armor set to support it. Other damage increasing legendaries are situational. Those that do have permanent effects against all targets require that a special condition be met or have very low increases. TS is way outside the norm in that it functions all the time, gives +100% damage, and doesn’t have any consequence on ammo consumption or durability. Explosive was worse, but now that we at least have a card that helps protect us in PvP there’s some chance against it. The AOE makes it possible to do tons of damage for the same cost of 1 bullet. Nerfing clear outliers is just part of game balance, and they both need it. 
---
To do as you suggest and buff others to fall in line, we would have to more than double the effect of other legendaries. Even then they wouldn’t compare because TS/E have no special conditions or requirements to activate. 
---
its a valid theory, but the math doesn't check out. I've tested it with my legendary handmade compared to a crafted hand made with out and with mods. It doesn't add up. It's bad code, plain and simple.
---
Yeah, damage resistances seem to be skewed in favor of melee atm, which doesn't make much sense imo, there is a reason guns are seen as better than knives, they kill better, faster, and from further away
---
Do you have any bloodied weapons? If you have a bloodied weapon equipped, it will add the damage bonus to all weapons in your inventory, but it doesnt actually give them the bonus damage
---
Was his name Soylent Green?
---
You just scienced the shit out of this argument.  Nice moves.
---
Thanks. I've got 6 or 7 Endurance, Lead Belly maxed.
---
I did find a toothbrush on a Feral Ghoul last night, so that will come in handy!
---
Are you on pc? I can show you my build in action.
---
The laser rifle absolutely needs some attention. I love the look and sound of the weapon but it’s a dud in high level activity. 
---
With re writing the code. Clearly you don't have knowledge in this area, if you rewrite a line of code and make one mistake you could change the code for multiple different lines of code.
---
Some enemies get scared by you and say so, run away crying. Or maybe you were standing on something not considered "ground" and the mutant went "looking" for you.
---
Dude, don't ditch your ammo because of this post. There is zero concrete evidence here. Don't use exploits and you will be fine. Make all the legitimate ammo you want. 
---
Yeah, I always make sure to scrap.
---
I got no issue stealing them from other players. The only jerk move I see is taking them from players that cant fight back.
---
Not sure how stomping a player that cant fight back would make for adrenaline fueled fun, fighting someone around my lvl would be fun and a challenge.
---
Im onboard with you, pvp can add a lot of fun and challenge to the game. All im saying is grief the people that can fight back not the little guys starting out in the forest. Not saying your doing that either, but I have experienced it a few times on my alt.
---
Fuck autocorrect lol
---
Really what?
---
Shotguns don't gain much at all from the TS affix.  It's all about the explosive damage per pellet instead of getting one extra pellet.
---
I have an explosive double barrel with a boring primary affix that wrecks everything.  All you need is for it to be explosive.
---
Hey I know you posted this like a week ago but if you're still sitting on those I'll buy them from you when I'm on tonight
---
How did that work out? I heard someone talk about they had a plumber build, but I didnt see the details.
---
Wait...I just started Far Harbor...now I really wanna rush through this dlc.
---
thats actually a great idea.  At that point, all i have to worry about is somebody using bobbleheads. and since im not melee the unyielding part doesnt matter.  even though i will loose advantage in stealth from agility/chameleon. 
---
Legendary supermutant shitpants 
---
I've never seen a deathclaw gauntlet, or shishkebab which is unfortunate. I have a two shot western revolver but like..it's level 15 so it sucks lmfao. Just holding onto it to give to a lower level 
---
You can't melee a flying scorchbeast. I use a fully automatic armor piercing handmade and it kills them in two fully vats criticals before they even land.
---
Actually you know what, I’ve been seeing this discussed a lot and I’m still pretty new to the game. What exactly is going on with TSEs in the upcoming patch? 
---
And to be honest, I just wanted to use it for the remainder of time left before it gets nerfed. Not for anything sinister really lol. I’ve never killed a scorchbeast yet and people are really screwing with me and my camp. I thought it might be a good deterrent lol.
---
that would be a god send
---
No, I don't have any bloodied weapons 
---
Who is boohooing? I’m a melee Build because how bad guns are in their current state. I know you want to have some kind of witty comeback to look at cool on reddit and everything, maybe instead jumping to “I’m a tough guy and you’re a baby” routine, should think about a response. Never said I was using a heavy weapon. But I have played other games besides this one, including Fallout ones. Guns need to be buffed, PA needs to be buffed, melee weapons need a nerf. How that for ya mr reddit tough guy. 
---
&gt; As others have said, if I'm going to spend weeks grinding for something it better be worth it.
---
Um, you are the one choosing to grind for it for weeks, Bethesda never dangled it in front of you.  You decided to do it on your own and aren't owed anything.
---
Had a legendary glowing mutant hound run away at Harper’s Ferry.  Never did find it. 
---
I think that the more stashes you build in your camp, the more space, but that’s only in your camp. You should a favorite stash box that will work around the whole map
---
Log out and back in. This should clear it up
---
Regardless to that, the point was people downvoting what is simply being spoken logically.
---
Great for big melee units, however for shooty enemies enforcer isn't as handy.  I found it far more effective to just stealth snipe the vast majority of stuff.
---
We should be able to trade our golden cards
---
I wonder if sloths have the exact same giant script from skyrim.
---
I burn them buying bulk lead, screws or fluxes for prime ammo etc.
---
I absolutely agree with you that duping has been a huge issue. I have put significantly less time into this game than I would have otherwise (still 80 some hours) because of duping and various other exploits causing bouts of rage that made me put the game away for a few days.
---
The TSE nerf and duping issue are separate problems though. Both modifiers gave 100% damage boosts. Comparatively to every other modifer except instigating on a sneak sniper build they were the only worthwhile modifiers for most guns. That was a problem that had to be addressed.
---
Do I hope they continue to do more to address duped items? Hell yes I do but this rebalancing was needed regardless in order for the game to allow for a healthy amount of build variety.
---
Because coding is magic that requires no effort and always works the first time with no trial and error phase.
---
Highly doable by Bethsoft considering there is already a mod that does this exactly on PC.
---
They do actually. Same with mini nukes oddly enough.
---
They key factor for fast sqb kills is not having a bunch of sponges doing no damage but scaling up her hp.
---
And melee ppl actually having a gun helps, especially shotguns to cripple her wings. Str builds can do it but they stand around then complain about her never landing
---
Mr Rimmer, I presume.
---
I was standing on the ground and was chasing it while other mutants were shooting at me.. 
---
That too it really is a pain 
---
Enemies that randomly spawn, are indistinguishable from other enemies and reflect 'over flow' damage back on the user don't allow for a 'right tools for the situation' aproach.  Hell, even a sneak attack build could easily pull off that damage with a sneaking headshot and kill themselves from the overflow if they shot a lower level mob.
---
its a fake post
---
Menu music still plays even though music volume is turned down. (PC)
---
Nan srry i think i’ll just get them myself
---
Dog, back in your cage!
---
I’m specialise in 2 hand melee and have an awful lot of perks devoted to it. I have 15 strength and every single perk point there is to enhance damage in 2 hand melee. That’s just strength, I have other perks in other special categories that also enhance my melee. So yes, I deal a good bit of damage with my spear, but I also have invested heavily in the ability to do so.
---
Underrated! Hahaha.
---
Unless you marsupial jump onto the second floor. 
---
Simple, but idiotic.
---
I got lucky and looted a LVL.50 Anti-Armor 10mm SMG, and after some tinkering and perk-card training I'm pretty happy with it. Also I like how the AP mag upgrade renames it to the "Anti-Armor Armor Piercing 10mm SMG". 
---
I wish I had your child-like oversimplification of reality. It must be so easy to go through life treating everything as if it were all the same thing, with no “messy nuances” or “non-egocentric perspectives” complicating everything.
---
so you just go around spouting irrelevant shit that has nothing to do with the topic of the thread?
---
I wasn't saying the poor little guy TO you. It was about you. Like I found a diseased animal dying on the side of the road. Standing over it, feeling sorrow, I whisper to the animal, "poor little guy". Then of course I put it out of it's misery. We are digital here so I merely say, "poor little guy."
---
Playing my alt as a vampire hunter style, with a claw weapon and crossbow, the vampire outfit, and cannibal.  The feasting and resulting blood fountain really pulls it all together!
---
Works as intended. What if you dumped all your stuff in then un equipped all your weight reducing perks. You'd have more in your box than the max. 
---
They could i suppose delete the items if overweight in the stash. 
---
now if that was a clothing item that gave a boost to running away. just imagine that.
---
My friend got wanted the other day for opening one and it has nothing for me....never noticed this before....
---
Hahaha I'm sure not every weapon in the game that can become legendary dupers have
---
Or it would just be shotguns, grognaks axes, lever action rifles, and tesla rifles :p
---
HairChalice
---
I didn’t make it, i just looted it.
---
Ask around and get opinions from people.  
---
Idk, I don't find the slew of new bugs that didn't in exist in 4 as charming, it looks more like shitty net code and honestly it's got me thinking that the next Bethesda game should just be single player. I had more fun back then.
---
*Degenerates*
---
The introduced the  pickpocket skill from the elder scrolls maybe. 
---
REMA5TERED
---
Camp budget says 30% stored, nothing in stored. 
---
Yup listed in the patch notes, you also become wanted if you pick someone else's box
---
I wish we could get a count on who actually gets this reference. 
---
ya i noticed it when i read the patch notes /s
---
Oh I was capping it solely to get the work shop and it didn't bother me to take it from them. The wasteland should be and is a dangerous place and not to be that guy, but he shot first. Why should I change severs when I can just take the workshop through pvp as the game intends.
---
But I agree it wasnt a fair move in the fact that he really had no chance but I'm sure eventually the same thing will happen to me and I'll get my fair share of karma
---
I also had 10+ crashes/disconnects in two hours last night on XB1, and like you most were soon after loading 
---
Maybe give the stash box perk slots of its own, which can't be removed if it would make the weight go over max 
---
Ah ok.
---
Well join in on the whiny circle jerk then.
---
Make some threads suggesting all kind of buffs.
---
Show bethesda we're a bunch of whiny entitled brats, because that is who bethesda will take feedback from...
---
Dense? What type?
---
Lol that could be interesting 
---
Honestly, it is a missile launcher.  I'd expect it to be pretty heavy.
---
It does seem unfair that certain builds have tons of weight reduction options while others don't.  (I play a stealth rifleman and my two guns take up over 35 lbs of my basic carry weight, so I get it.)
---
A two-shot missile launcher might be worth paring down your stash for.  I'd love to have you around with that gun for an SBQ fight, assuming you perked in 5 ranks of demo expert to deal double damage.
---
At one point I was stashing 300+ of almost every scrap and storing 10 stimpacks and radaway for a rainy day.  I took out all chems and food, dramatically reduced my stash to not more than 100 units of stuff my character doesn't eat like candy, namely lead and steel to make ammo, and I'm now around 570 weight with a handful of choice two shot guns and an instigating sledge waiting in the wings for players that will give me a wave and enjoy a freebie for being friendly.  It's all legitimately farmed from RNG and hours looping Watoga and Whitesprings while server hopping after each run.  Now I carry only 100 or less of common junk aside from screws, lead and steel, which I cap at 500, only store 20 bone and cork, and 50 of anything I don't use a lot of (nuclear material, gold, silver).  I usually roll with rank 3 traveling pharmacy and pick up only chems and valuable cosmetic clothing to vendor every day with bobby pins making up that last cap.
---
yes, still by far the best place for EXP grinding.
---
ME TOO.
---
&gt; (bought or were given duped items)
---
I've seen zero evidence anyone was banned for holding a duped weapon they acquired from someone else.  I strongly suspect the people you mentioned were banned for other reasons.
---
I have this issue with crafting ammo
---
you can when they land.
---
Yeah exactly this is how it should of be done, whoever made the brain dead decision to do it this way should be fired.
---
** (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)**
---
I can't move sometimes on XB after loading in since the last patch. I can fast travel but even after fast travelling I still can't move. 
---
It really is. Feel free to add me gmaat3. Mention you’re the cryolator user in the message so I remember lol
---
I’ll make it for you materials and all, all I ask is 150 caps. I’ll do it for free if you have the materials though. According to the wiki you need 4-circuitry, 3-fiber optics, 3-glass, 4-adhesive, 7-plastic, 7-steel, 6-screw. I will confirm this when I’m online in a couple hours 
---
God Howard
---
Well at least you feel remorse next time be more careful of my sensitive feelings. Not everyone can just feel compassion like you do &lt;3
---
Because whenever the situation arises for me to use one I forget or I am to lazy to scroll through all the clutter. I really wish I could display or sell them 🥺
---
If you can't find them and there's no paper bag, then it's likely that dogmeat farted several states to the north east and your weapons were blown away.
---
I talked to someone who bought RD2 and was playing FO76 with me. I asked why he chose to play the game after all the crashes and stuff we deal with regularly and he told me that RD2 is fun and great but FO76 has a ton more depth than the RD2 world has with regards to looting and crafting and building. There's just so much to this game, it would be surprising if there weren't issues with it.
---
Yes, it's pretty frustrating lol. Just went to check, bought a 2 plans, 100 and 700 caps each. Vendor's still sitting cozy at 200. Are you on console? Maybe it was a fix that pc hadn't received yet? 
---
Yeah I exaggerated a bit to much. The point still stands with the same perk investment melee just does more damage. 
---
Xp still isn't awful, and you will generally have more chances at 3 stars than a SBQ fight (also ionized meat and glowing masses are super good for carnivores)
---
It's probably all the screws. I never have enough screws...
---
I will give you 5/10 on your shitpostting skills. 
---
Honestly, the game just doesn't have enough different damage mechanics to make the game interesting once you hit level 50.  At that point, gear is your only way to progress.  All we have for damage are pretty boring weapons.  For any other MMO-type game like this, I'd expect some magic or tech options to weaken enemies, do damage over time, etc.
---
It's basically shoot or smash, end of list.
---
for example there is a legendary supermutant in Huntsville. every time you get near it, it runs away.
---
The mod may only weigh a pound, but when you attach it you gotta use all those screws, adhesive, etc to hold it in place.  Maybe a bobbi pin.  Duck tape yo!
---
Sorry for being rude im just super angry, my attitude is a bit off today. I was referring to the inside the vault article. The reason for the nerf is PVP according to the article. 
---
First things first, I love your name OP. Legit.
---
Second, sameee.
---
Any of those enemies not scorched or ghouls? Aim at a snallegaster or wendigo. 
---
It had explosive shot. 😔
---
they are secretly taking your dupes.......cough...cough...I mean it's a bug
---
And in these games, high level players “hold everyone else down by killing new players on site?” New players have no hope of leveling up or finding gear at a reasonable pace?
---
Wish they had split the difference, making TS 50% damage or something, and buffing all the situational affixes like creature-type specific, nocturnal, etc.  if it were +80% or more damage against scorched, mutants, etc...that would be cooler.  Now they all kinda suck
---
It’s highly relevant. Get your self a bloodied melee weapon. Don’t bother with TSE. 
---
I've been enjoying it, too. I'm also around your level, though, so maybe that's why. It's still "new" to us, lol. Honeymoon phase?
---
My issues with it aren't with the game itself. It's with the bugs. Getting DC'd mid-event so you worked for nothing, or stuck in a forever-loading screen, or can't finish a quest because the mob doesn't spawn, etc.
---
THAT stuff is incredibly frustrating and what would eventually get me to quit if it keeps happening. You can have a great game, but if you can't really play it then what's the point?
---
They seem to be trying, and the bugs aren't as overwhelming as they used to be at least, so I continue to play. Even got another copy so two of us in the house can play together :)
---
Whether I stick to it for a long time or bow out after a few months, I don't feel I wasted my money anyway.
---
Go run headfirst into a pack of Supermutant Bucketheads.
---
Last time I did that, I used my shotgun with the Enforcer perk to cripple the lot, one at a time while running away; it left a trail of wriggling green monsters to finish up quietly.
---
It was a joke....hence the smiley face at the end. Jeeze. 
---
Bad sync. Always fast travel before logging out. this tends to actually save your progress!
---
I am a  lone wanderer and level 96 still so idk if SBQ is something for me yet
---
take off all you buff perks and stand in a ghoul fest, Whitesprings golf club for high level results.
---
I can try to record me running yelling "long dick johnson" my actual user handle. Instead of yelling lerroy jenkins
---
I don't know about negligible, it just depends on your priorities.  Even though I only use the same two guns and two melee, I like having a couple extra guns of various caliber just in case.  Since these are my holdout weapons, I'm okay not modding them much to keep the weight down so I have a couple of pistols that weigh half a pound.
---
Will I ever need to pull them out?  I really doubt it, in the base game at least.  If a DLC cuts you off from your STASH for a considerable amount of time it might come in handy, but that's way too early to plan for. Yet planning for that and other crazy scenarios gives me a little peace of mind, well worth the pound of space.
---
Lead and junk?  Dude, that is Gold!!!
---
Can’t argue that lol I’ve still got the tse handmade I paid 15K for the second week of the game lol😂 I didn’t know duping was a thing at that time
---
thank
---
I'm not sure about the nerf, the game need new contents over balance right now imho. The nerf won't stop me killing all the ghouls in whitespring with a shot or two, I can already see the difference in "PvP", but for PvE it won't change anything apart making SBQ fights last longer. We want new bosses, quest lines, camp budget increase campaigns etc.

[Schrodinger's Troll](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=schr%C3%B6dinger%27s%20troll)
---
I love when she stays on the ground the whole, only the third time thats happened for me.
---
For me it's the beavers I feel bad about killing. Not sure why. They just seem like such bros.
---
Understandable argument. I have only one rebuttal. People are upset only if it effects them or their experience. I think people are correlating server/application crashes with dupers. 
---
My only experience with someone I thought to be exploiting in some way, was a guy who could not be killed. I have TSE combat shot gun that did not damage with his health bar completely at minimum. I could care lass if you are fighting SBQ while invulnerable, but if you keep attacking my team and I and our bases with a switchblade because you cannot be killed. I have an issue. 
---
Yes I'm on the ps4. Maybe that's got something to do with it? But it could also be there's a hard 200 cap that I never noticed because I always sell first and then buy if there's something I want (which is rare in itself)
---
Ah, just curious.
---
At the moment tse’s are labelled controversial because a) they’re extremely powerful b)because of their power they have been targeted by people who use exploits to duplicate them and damage the games economy. Chances are if you buy or trade for a tse, it’s going to have been duplicated at some point in its past. So they’re dirty.
---
The nerfs are being put in place to address a community concern that these items are in fact too powerful, and as such, the 2 shot second shot is being nerfed to 25% instead of 100% and explosive is being nerfed to 20%. 
---
In terms of using them as a deterrent, I dig, but if griefers are griefing, they probably have counters for its might. Such as explosive damage protection perks and assassins legendary effects on their armor.
---
My point is: is melee better if it is dead in the sky before it has a chance to land?
---
A gun let's you deal damage no matter the circumstance. Flying? Damage. Landing? Damage. A melee only user does zero damage to a flying enemy. It takes longer to kill it if you have to wait for it to land before you can damage it. A good gun will kill that thing before melee is even an option.
---
i got that but why did someone feel the need to post it.
---
Stand under a Scorchbeast
---
You have a perk card to make everything weigh less, you fill your stash, remove the perk card, now your stash is 3 times over capacity.
---
That's why perk cards don't effect the stash 
---
There is no cap, there is a multiplication. It's a bit different :-) 
---
Haha yup
---
Personally I go to vault 76 run to flat woods then fast travel to pleasant valley then white springs next watoga finally Harpers ferry 
---
Ah I gotcha. Those days happen.
---
I read it, seems to say here:
---
&gt; We know that there has been some frustration over how powerful these mods are, particularly when combined and used in player vs. player combat. 
---
PvP was a big concern but not the only one. I think they said that because of that video that went around here recently of a dude killing with one at a workshop.
---
Go visit my behemoth friend in the mountains next to white springs or go to an area where there are bears, those bears damage armour pretty quick ..
---
Yeah one of my most used poses I think.

Quit asking for buffs pretty soon we'll all be running around with pool noodles and water guns against the SBQ

No one said i wasnt a Crazy Person. People should stop being so judgemental. If you understand what im saying, theres no need to attack how i say it. Thanks for floating along with me though 👍😀

Just repeating the point seeing as they knew
---
Got 3 hard crashes back to home yesterday on Xbox, along with a few "game freezes then jumps back to projector loading clip". 
---
I will be sure to do that👍 
---
People like Dead Money?  It wasn't bad, but it surely wasn't my favorite.
---
Hey man if you see a bunch of dots heading down there after the nuke hits get in on the action! the more ppl the better! Its a trophy too if youre into that
---
&gt; it does take thousands of rounds to kill anything above lvl 50
---
Demonstrably untrue.  I go around clearing level 68 supermutants often.  2-3 well-placed hunting rifle rounds does it from sneak, or ~6 rifle rounds (from a two-shot assault rifle).
---
Yes, you need to go all-in on perks for rifles to do that, and you have to stay within weapon range or you get huge damage drop-off, but you can get there.
---
oh boy the irony, and your lack of argument
---
Agreed, the events don't have a special feel vs. regular mobs.  What I was trying to say was that the 30+ caps I lose are worth doing events for me at level 110+ to mix it up and have some sort of objective rather than farm legendaries or junk and scrap to sell. 
---
You forget one important thing though. With your stealth gun build you are at a distance. And that can help mitigate the damage you take. Us melee builds are right up in the action. We take a ton of damage. So it's a trade damage done and received high, or done and received less. Each has their own advantages. Play the way you want. 
---
I’m on Xbox. I mean maybe I dropped it. Who knows. I did see others saying they had issues on this subreddit when I searched though.
---
You spend entirely too much time on here. 
---
Yeah, I think I’d agree with that, but as a counter point, you can hide behind terrain with a gun, you can’t with an axe. Range is it’s own advantage.
---
So the tin cans break down into lead?  I really should learn some of this stuff.  Thanks for the tip.
---
This is why i started keeping just two guns and the ammo for them, along with one melee weapon.
---
It sucks, but until they raise the stash again or fix/debug weight management, it works. 
---
Last time i was fighting on the tenniscourt shooting a bunch of ghouls  with my two shot gatling gun while a scorchbeast was attacking me with those annoying  ultrasonic blasts, the jetpack really is a blessing on those moments.. 
---
Honestly, I wouldn't worry about it unless you found it in a paper bag with suspicious stuff in it, like 1000's of nuka-cola quantum. 
---
Lots of high level players do drop off large quantities of legitimate ammo that they don't need. There is nothing wrong with taking this. 
---
Pretty common.  If you go out of bounds (which I probably wouldn't recommend given the dev room soft bans) you can find her, she'll be flying high up just sitting there in the sky.

But they have so many caps!

Inter office communication at Bethesda, pretty sure I saw it on a milk carton.

Think with the right guns to cripple wings it can always happen
---
These are great! My wife plays by sitting next to me and telling me how to decorate my camp so it doesn't look like a shithole.
---
I do understand we just dont agree. 
---
It's probably the big I posted about weeks ago that nobody have a shit about. If you move a bunch of stuff by mashing the pick up/drop button really fast it will sometimes grab from other tabs.
---
I went to drop a bunch of junk I didn't want before and almost lost my legendary handmade.

I got a sub machine gun with both of these and it is amazing.

I think the barn set can be obtained randomly via capturing and/or defending overworld workshops. I've gotten it a couple times; might have an extra.
---
I picked them up as a workshop reward. Not seen them anywhere else
---
What other games has reddit ruined? I don't follow many games so I dunno. Reddit is a force for good, I mean we *caught* the Boston Bomber!
---
/S I guess
---
They're at the mercy of the higher level players. Some higher level players are benevolent, others are not.
---
No paper bag. I even dropped the one weapon I had left to see if it spawned a paper bag and nope. LOL. F this game. At least I only spent an hour of my life paying this shit. Lvl2 is as far as I'll go!
---
Have you tried doing workshops to try to get it?
---
How much more does one have to extend a fusion core? Maybe I'm not playing much or not doing what you're doing but i have a lot of fusion cores and they seem to last for a long time.
---
Can't speak for xbox but I've been getting crashes on ps4 as well. 
---
I just want it balanced tbh. Weight of mods/items sorted out, enemy hp needs a happy median instead of cardboard to bullet sponge within a few levels, legendary loot pool and weapons balance need a pass too....
---
I don't want easy mode, I just want the curve smoothed out. 
---
Oh really I drop random crap all the time...shit
---
I use the revolver as a hip fire rifle and hold onto a bolt action as my "sniper." It was pointed out to me that the bolt action is actually more accurate then the hunting rifle but I cant verify this at the moment.
---
 With the gunsmith perks and pipe perks my gun never breaks. I also took the free repair chance from luck when I fire my rifle. Sure maybe its overkill but it means my materials go to other needs. It is actually tempting me to do a pipe weapon auto rifle character. Really Ammo would be your only major problem.
---
Vendor hop the watoga super duper vendor or train vendor or both or harper ferry location, that's your best bet, will still take time. I won a set at a workshop yesterday, but it is RNG, find a empty server and take as many workshops and try your luck.
---
Two-shot has a nasty accuracy penalty.  You have to build for accuracy/recoil and it's not great at range or high RoF.
---

Thanks! I will give it a try tonight.

This is a really big find. C.A.M.P. bugs affect everyone who plays regardless of play style. Thank you for posting this.

Started trying them today but is there a specific workshop I need to go to? I’ve been trying Monongah Power Plant Yard and got ok plans but no barn building set. 
---
What platform you on ?
---
I'm pretty sure those irritating level 40 machinegun turrets with exploding bullets will chunk your armor super fast

I hope you disposed of them in a responsible way

Five words: OLD WORLD BLUES LEGENDARY BLOATFLY
---
Still the best place to farm 3 stars cycling through, being in the middle of the map increase the chances of low level players approaching and spawning new ghouls. If they don't increase mob spawns in other nuked zones, whitespring will be always the best no matter what
---
Heh, perk choice is key. Focus strength. Get solar powered under endurance, get radicool, and keep half your health rads. Reach the cap of strength. Get twisted muscles mutation. Stack all melee perks. Unarmed also effects a majority of one handed melee. And one handed can effect unarmed. Stack the shit out of them. My special for strength is at 15
---
But when you look at my special In pip, I'm always 25 of strength, because of perks like solar powered amd radicool. Twisted muscles helps a bunch! If you play with another person occasionally, when you do switch on strange in numbers under charisma (assuming they're mutated too). That improves the positive mutation effects by 25% bloodied melee weapons play super well with radicool perk as you're always half health or fairly low.
---
I have a bloodied furious switchblade with swing speed..
---
It's a monster with this build. 
---
Right now as I'm typing this I have a little less than half health due to rads, My serrated legendary switchblade is doing 150 each swing, that combined with furious effect and swing speed makes this a damage output monster. It's crazy. 
---
If you go with radicool, invest in first aid and hoard stimpaks, as you're always fairly low on health. You'll need to use stimpaks to stay at that health far more frequently, but if you buy the recipe from the enclave bunker and go tic farming, it's all well.
---
I like to use melee bobblehead or the magazine which makes melee damage output better (I believe it's grognaks just don't remember the volume) unarmed bobbleheads ect.
---
Become a monster with your build. 
---
Explosive doesnt work 90% of the time when she is in the air. Anything that isnt explosive, use that.

PS4- What is the point of allowing us to lock the doors on our houses, presumably to keep other players out, when they can just jump through the windows? Specifically Im speaking about the brick set windows, the snaller single window and not the double windows. A player can just jump right through the single window but not the double window variant. The windows have bars on them but players just go right through them. I was the victim of a home invasion this morning by a much higher level player and no longer feel safe inside my own home. Please fix this in an upcoming update as I assume that this was an over site and not an intended weakness camp security. House building is one of my favorite aspects of these games and I take pride in building something attractive.  I refuse to be one of the people the build floating wooden box monstrosities with no windows. Please add collision to the bars in the windows, thx.
---
I always log out in power armour. Or a hazmat suit for this reason!
---
Kev. No last name, middle name, surname. Just Kev, and the number 76 on my back. I left the Vault searching for purpose and stood in awe when I saw a Brotherhood patrol of players stop by Flatwoods. I pledged myself to service, and found myself carrying out my life according to the Codex. To raise armies, we borrowed food. To fight the Scorched, we had to borrow guns and men (as if we can return the \*we\* lives lost).  And when that failed, to survive the Scorched, we borrowed shelter. 
---
I have since deserted.
---
I've fallen in ranks with the Responders. I can fight, but I can't fight the Scorched alone.
---
But I can help those trying.
---
Just relog? 
---
Said it before and totally agree. Just load us in, we're good!
---
Negative reviews gets them the views, likes and affirmation that they desperately need. 
---
I imagine a large part of the player-base is too busy playing to make a video, I know I am. I would argue (*if* we cared about other people's opinions) that it's part our fault for not spending the time to make videos to balance out all the negative videos on it.

General weight needs to be reworked.

Long barrels should be heavier than short.

A 2lb mod added to a 6lb rifle should total weight of 8lb, not 20lb.
---
Raise stash to 1000. 
---
Already mentioned that, find some kind of alternate fix 
---
I tend to at least not log out in either of the two places on this gigantic map that people constantly nuke. And in the rare instance I do, I throw on my power armor first as well.
---
When you take workshops and log out some of the stuff gets stored at your camp, this can make you over budget.
---
I am. I’ll happily pay the caps and I might be able to give you an old legendary as well
---
Or find some kind of solution, I have come up with a couple of ideas to help this
---
Make it work the same as The Tower/Farm in Destiny/2. Players can come and go freely, meet up, get bounties, purchase/sell gear.
---
Also combat is disable.

That's the thing. If this is studio level then it's ok, just skip anything by Bethesda Austin. But if it's publisher level then...ehhhhh. That worries me for the future. I love Bethesda and their games and I don't want to see a slip-up like this again.

The Free States are part of Fallout, so their lore is fallout lore.
---
Gotta say, I am happy that I found a level 50 anti-armor hunting rifle on a vendor a couple days after the last patch.  No idea who sold that, but I was pretty giddy.
---
Aw. dont give up that easily. You can get new weapons pretty easily. The game is fun. Give it a chance.
---
Prior to the TSE discovery, Melee was already considered not OP, but certainly an easier win strat.  PA, SS, win.
---
That hasn't changed.  Automatic and Energy weapons are underpowered in the game.  People shouldn't HAVE to play one way to have the best chance.  That's not what FO has been about.  
---
If you do I’ll pay caps and I’ll give a spare legendary if you want also

&gt;  I really disliked Fallout 4. 
---
 I don't have a problem with you liking Fallout 76, but the hate for Fallout 4 has reached new and heightened levels of insanity with 76's release. 
---
Many people argue that  New Vegas is better than Fallout 4. 
---
It's not an argument I agree with, but the reasoning behind it is sound and I can see the point of people making it. 
---
I don't see how anyone can argue that 76 is better than four.  I can accept (but don't agree with) someone thinking that 76 is maybe about as good as   4.
---
But saying "Fallout 76 is great and Fallout 4 sucks"  really does sound more like trolling. 
---
I don't see how anyone could seriously argue that. 
---
Yeah, Patches have improved the game somewhat.  But this game was released in a completely broken state and was a technical nightmare up until very recently. 
---
Stuck in power armor.  Disappearing camps.  Items completely gone from the camps that disappeared when you rebuild them.  Suffering melee damage from a scorched how is obviously inches away from you but is invisible, not because of a stealth boy, but because of a bug. 
---
Getting the scorch beast queen down to 1 percent health  and then having the entire server crash. 
---
I don't care that much of it has been fixed.    
---
Yeah, I've had fun with it, but the game was a dumpster fire upon release in way the Fallout 4 doesn't come close to. 
---
I wish I tried to over think game mechanics.  I'm going to blow up some noobs camps for the first time tonight just for you ;)
---
Make a new character 
---
If you're on XBox call me... I'll orbital strike it and let you immediately gun me down for the caps. twofer!
---
You cant say that because people may or may not show up with TSE weapons.   I am melee heavy weapons currently, yah I hit hard with Melee, but saying everyone should be melee vs a monster that's in the dam air half the time is a stupid solution to an already lag filled fight.
---
I just crashed 5 times in a matter of 5 minutes against the SBQ
---
It wouldn't be that bad here because the server size is limited to 32.  Other comments mentioned a beacon, I think that's a good idea, and the beacon could list the items for sale.  You would still need to travel to the vendor to pick it up.
---
Yeah but if you just made the same thing somewhere else wouldn't people do the exact same thing?
---
And if someone wanted to auction their stuff, couldn't they just... stand in Whitesprings?
---
And why would anyone want to just... stand around in an area of a video game doing nothing?
---
I have a melee class that I made making variations to male preset #09 to make it look like comedian Jimmy Norton, he’s a cannibal, a raider and all around degenerate.

They should tested all the legendary perk combinations especially the ones that cause damage, it would have been obvious that two shot and explosive should have been coded in a way made it impossible to have them on the same weapon 
---
The number of hours per person works actually makes sound statistical sense.   
---
Here is why:
---
Consider the fact that just in the United States there are **325.72 million** people total, of all ages.   
---
\[SOURCE: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk)\]
---
* Only **153.34 million** people who are actively employed. 
---
* **125.97 million work full-time** (35+ hours plus weekly, or 7.5+ hours daily) 
---
* **27.37 million work part-time** (1-34 hours weekly, or less than 7.5 hours daily)  
---
\[SOURCE: [https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat08.htm](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat08.htm)\]  
---
We can make some very rough estimates, especially considering part-time hours worked daily since I could not find precise figures on part-time hour specifics in 2017. For the sake of argument, lets say ALL part-time workers only work 4 hours a day and that ALL full-time workers work 8 hours a day.  Just roll with me for demonstrations sake:  
---
FULL-TIME HOURS DAILY : 125,970,000 \* 8 =  1,007,760,000 hours  
---
PART-TIME HOURS DAILY : 27,370,000 \* 4.0 = 109,480,000 hours  
---
TOTAL HOURS WORKED DAILY : 1,117,240,000  
---
Divide the total number of hours worked by **all** Americans by the total number of Americans (regardless of age or employment status) and you get an average of **3.43 hours worked**.   
---
1,117,240,000 / 325,720,000 = 3.430062630480167  
---
So while the number might sounds odd to you, you were not taking into consideration the ENTIRE population. Obviously infants, toddlers, children, teenagers, and many other people are not working 8 hour days or any hours at all but they still account into the totals when getting an average...  
---
That being said, I stand by the original statement that the average person sleeps for 8.8 hours daily (including naps and periods of sleep related restlessness in bed).  While tons of people might sleep only 5 hours a night, there are also tons of people who might sleep for 10 hours as well. Hence, averages.

Yeah I totally agree would rather have an extra 30 second loading screen in order to have all my things load in it sucjs just seeing a floating head first time it was funny though

Yes.  What level are you that you're thinking it isn't?

I do still have it .. depends what it is, I had to dump so many lengendaries ... I assume it is the same price as the brick set, so you can have it for 384 caps.
---
I am on now, but only have about 30 mins before my next meeting. I will pm you my GT
---
Explosive is the problem, not two-shot.  Explosive is OP and needs to be reigned in.
---
I agree it needs a nerf, but not into broken levels.....and two shot shouldnt have been touched, explosive should have been fixed.
---
In the wise words of my fiancée :
---
&gt; Thèse dishes do not bring me joy, but I need them to put my food on.
---
Stop logging out at Whitesprings. 
---
This post is complete bullshit. First of all why the fuck use a crossbow as an example? Might have well used a dam flare gun instead. 
---
I went lvl 1 all the through 100 as a stealth rifle player. Actually I tried pistol for about 35 levels before changing to rifle. 
---
I had ABSOLUTELY ZERO PROBLEMS killing things from stealth. I used a vats crit luck build. If I didn't 1 shot something then 2 shot them. Only problem I had was when I got caught out of stealth. Other then that my NORMAL lever action rifle w mods did fine. Now I have an instigating lever action and that's even better from stealth. 
---
After lvl 100 I had more then enough point to change to a melee build. About the only thing I like more about melee is I don't have to make ammo anymore and the SBQ fights are less of a hassle. I kept my rifle perks and enough to Agi to still stealth and get the sneak bonus. So w a LESSER rifle build focusing on melee I still have no problem killing things w my gun. 
---
A LOT of guns do suck. I think pistols are horrid. However there is someone on this board w a pistol vats build taking out a scorched beast, death claw and some other tanky monster w a pistol in less then 2 minutes. 
---
The issue is MORE THEN LIKELY half you complainers don't know how to build or play properly. Sorry if you don't like that but it's probably true. 
---
But let's be real here. Most of the guns need a buff.  NO denying that.  Does anyone at all use laser weapons? Not that I see. I personally never tried them so I really don't know. 
---
But what you posted is horse shit. If it's taking you 30  shots to kill mobs then have you checked you're not using a lvl 5 gun by mistake? I mean seriously. Either your way over reacting or you are a terrible shot of have a terrible build. Or stop using shitty crossbows? 
---
I'll give it to you about scorthbeasts though. I definitely have an easier time w them as melee. Once they finally land. However there are massive chunks of time I'm screaming at my TV for them to stop blasting me w endless ring blast spam and fucking land already. But yes, once they land they go down super fast. But that's about the only time, and SBQ, I'd say melee is that superior to a ranged rifle build. Oh but then I remember I still have rifle perks and I shoot them and still see chunks of health come off, and I'm not even in stealth. So, yeah, once again I can still damage it from range. To reiterate though I do a larger chunk of damage once I get in melee range. That's just a fact melee hits harder. 
---
Also agree w you that nerfing is not the answer. 
---
I haven't used one in Fallout 76, but I had a couple in Fallout 4.  Rapid fire accuracy was terrible because of the dramatically increased recoil, but they made terrific sniper rifles.  They were good for spray-and-pray where you don't care about accuracy, and for one-shot-one-kill sniping where the recoil doesn't matter, but weren't very good for stuff in-between.
---
I assume they're similar in 76.

Thanks so much! I’ll say what the legendaries are but I don’t think they’re overly good

Yes there were always drugs in the bathrooms. Haven’t seen much of that either, but that could just be the persistent online world

Even better if you're only looking for legendaries: Run around Watoga and hit every robot pod, in addition to your circuit. I regularly encounter a few 2-3 star protectrons, and collect 5-10 bottles of various alcoholic drinks each run (I'm RPing a drunk). 
---
I get that melee is king but you need like 13? Perk cards minimum for melee (3 sets of weapon and the straight damage perk, durability), and at least 12 str, but 15 is preferred.  You’re going to need armor/pa perks to survive because you will get hit a lot. 
---
You can make a valid point about melee being long but be honest that the build is involved.  It’s not just a “few” perks.
---
Yea, the old Bee, with a great Conference Call shotgun on Gaige at full 600 Annarchy with the bullet bounce was an incredible map clearing combo.

I just gave up for the night.

Haha thats when I get a friend to join my server, swap out my toons and give you a challenge, but not everyone has that ability.
---
To reference your monopoly analogy, fighting someone on equal ish terms is like landing on boardwalk and having to pay rent. Griefing people that cant fight back is like having the biggest/strongest person at the table cherry pick all the best properties everyone has and taking all your money that has a "zero" on it, and if you try to do anything they bop you on the head and knock you the F out. Yea the big dude probably have fun, but I doubt they would be invited to the next game, because all their fun was at the expense of someone else.
---
The wasteland is a dangerous place, but it doesnt mean you have to be a jerk to people that cant defend themselves from you.

the only problem with an open world hub is that people will inevitably nuke it for lulz.  I'm not sure I would want to prevent it either. There just needs to be adequate balance for defender vs attacker.

Happend to me once, thought it was funny, like what are the odds lol
---
It was 100% of base weapon damage.  It isn't unfair to anyone, and the accuracy/recoil penalty is a drawback.
---
My best TS weapon does 144 damage (hardened combat rifle) with all my Rifleman perks maxed.  That is not game-breaking.  People are doing other stuff to break the game.

It takes 5 lb of duct tape to get it on.

Bob Roberts aka Asatru as his friends call him. Master mechanic who landed his vault 76 spot due to an uncle who had a drinking peoblem despite his degree in electrical engineering, being piss drunk during the vault tek interviews. 
---
He spends his time repairing anything he finds broken. While plodding through Appalachia with a pipe rifle in hand... looking for any vehicle that isnt dead. Still looking...
---
Jenova Shepard. No one is sure how she managed a vault spot let alone a private vip sized family room for just her self. But the last time that argument came up she put 3 men and a child in the infirmary.  
---
Her files say.. well they dont say much. She is obviously a master at hand to hand combat and can hack terminals and pick locks faster than anyone has ever seen. And asside from her personal assultron affectionately named Kleo is a consummate loner. 
---
Whispers of being an assassin.. make her blush. Overseer recommended to avoid unless absolutely necessary. 
---
Rick Sanchez. Aka "grampa Rick" has more degrees than toilet paper and often uses them as such. The only vaulter to somehow exit and re enter the vault without using the front door. 
---
Has a drinking problem. And when he drinks too much typically solves or causes wars. Also known to cure cancer and was a founder of the institute.  Favors cryo and plasma weapons and is able to somehow open portals for fast travel. Overseer recommended avoiding interaction. 
---
Dwyane "the rock" Johnson.

Ganking is a form of pvp I also enjoy. (Killing defenseless players gathering).  My first experience with it was in aion, I was first day, gathering plants and some dude came outta nowhere and wrecked me and my brother with his flaming sword lol.  Kept me fueld with hate for years to come as I went on to kill him for the first time after like two years passed lol.  Godlike was his name.  I'll never forget xD. 
---
 Nice build! I tried to do something similar, but the XB controls are so terrible I scrapped it all in frustration.
---
No judgments of those who fly the flag under different means, you collect that booty as ye see fit.
---
I'm online now
---
Were you one of the 3 other people there? It was around 4pm yesterday..we dropped her pretty quick
---
Wow. Some major whingers here. Two shot is literally double damage. Barring Explosive, no other legendary mod even comes close to that.
---
Dragonrend 
---
yeah exagerated going to fix.
---
Got them from claiming Lakeside Cabins and from Grafton Steel. But also found them in the toolbox behind the door at site Alpha
---
Fuck that whitespring music, it's so annoying.
---
To those saying domt log there or log in power armor read the post, nuke hit me while loading.   I dont care I died I care I cant fucking respawn anywhere on the map because the locations are all locked....because while dead my power armor no longer gives me weight benefits showing I'm over weight......its broken period stop arguing not.
---
They supposedly already fixed it so u can spawn while over weight at another location....such was not true.
---
Bethesda never suggested you grind for weeks for TSE weapons.  Do whatever you want.
---
I could care less about twitch. I doubt I’m the only one. People should hit 500 or more?? Maybe if they take the game way too seriously. Most people on my servers are around 100-200+. I don’t think I’ve *ever* seen the same person twice unless I friended them. I find it really hard to believe that this is a regular occurrence for you. 
---
It sounds like you see what you want to see to confirm your bias. None of the points you made add up at all. 
---
What's next on the Nerf list?
---
Radium rifle?
---
Mutations?
---
Perk cards?
---
PvP should have been left out of this game. Destiny had similar issues but Destiny open world enemies are just shooting targets where 76 has high level players spawning level 68 enemies for level 20 players. Most non legendary guns and even the majority of the shitty legendary drops are basically BB guns vs bullet sponges. Also players spend weeks building their skill tree around the weapons they get in Fallout titles only to have them be nerfed.
---
PvP players will be playing on empty servers in no time.
---
This...what games has reddit managed to ruin OP?
---
Maybe OP just means his enjoyment of the game (or lack of it since they said they going to fix the exploits).
---
Lot of people in this sub seem to think there the centre of the universe 
---
To my understanding it was only available during the Beta, and yes I was aware of that
---
Those things are op in pve too. But fun when soloing.
---
This is just one of the massively broken systems with the game, and needs a complete review and fix.
---
What I mean is, like you pointed out, weights don't add up. Secondly, mods are not affected by weight reduction. Meaning base weapon may be 90% lighter, but modded weapon will be only 40% lighter, if that. Third, some weapons don't have weight reduction via perks (all rifles), which is a very big issue. And finally, there's precious little indication of how these weights affect the AP cost of the weapon in VATS. Which would be nice to know, seeing how many perks in the game are locked to VATS. 
---
Bottom line, like pretty much everything in the game, this is broken and needs to be reviewed and fixed.
---
Go find asshole with duped tse lol seem to plenty about, for the time being anyway
---
I wonder how much one fist of iron and one fist of steel would weigh
---
The issue with an Auction House system is that there is little to no incentive to acquire caps. It's already to the point where many players already have everything the in game vendors have to offer.
---
Sure, you could argue that selling on the AH and acquiring caps will enable you to then buy legendary items that you want from the AH. But the items in 76 are finite. There are only so many TSE guns you can have before you've got them all. Plus the lower tier weapons have no demand because other weapons outshine them. No one's looking to drop their caps on an Armor Piercing, Instigating, Pitchfork when those same affixes would be miles better on a Super Sledge.
---
When we look at MMOs with player run auction systems, those games have other incentives to spend that in-game currency on. A much larger breadth of items, mounts, pets, cosmetic items, etc. 76 has none of this.
---
The only viable way for 76 to have a successful player sustained Auction House system (in my mind), would be if Beth allowed us to buy Atoms with Caps. Even if the rate is massive like 100 Atoms per 10,000 Caps, it would give players some incentive to try and amass Caps via the (theoretical) in-game Auction House.
---
I play on PS4, but that's pretty cool that there's already a mod to do it on PC.
---
Your right, but ever story has a villain and every villain has victims. War never changes and there will be casualties. 
---
My only regret is I didn't give a dramatic monologue while doing it
---
Oh, I have all the holotapes listed on the wikis and guides. I've even listened to them all, multiple times.
---
Ahh i see. thanks.
---
So everything in the devroom is slated for release in production?  No.  Stop spreading rumors.
---
Its advantage doesn't outway its risks, as most enemies are melee or have attacks that can hit you behind cover that do more damage then their base ones. See supermutant grenades. 
---
There were about 4 of us on top and maybe 2 others on the ground moving around. It took about 12 minutes unfortunately, and was around 1230 pacific time, I'd guess
---
its been like that sence the game came out and 50 caliber rounds do less
---
What level lock pick? 
---
ikr like take a look at the community.. i see maybe 5 or 6 positive posts and then like 4 neutral ones. then hundreds of negative ones... 
---
They told my buddy they are back logged for at least 48 hrs last night
---
The game was fun to play for the first time. When I reached level 50 it became boring as hell. After that it was only min-maxing your gear and even that doesn't really matter because all of the challenges in the game were easy faceroll already for medium quality weapons.
---
I played without any cheats or known glitches and achieved level 50 in about \~5 days and I didn't need to hurry at all. First time events were fun to play, but after doing same events again and again I noticed how poorly they are designed. Enemies will spawn almost every time to same places and they use always same spawn pattern (few behind you and few front of you). Anti air events are the most boring event from all. Enemies will spawn inside AA guns every time and you need to try to save those guns.
---
PVP is also totally broken and not fun at any way. But yeah, when you reach level 50 you will see how boring this game is. Enjoy your moments now as long as it lasts. What comes to fixing the game, Bethesda isn't really trying to put much effort to fix any current problems in the game. They seem to have already given up and decided that FO76 was a total failure and just trying to give some impression to the people that they are trying to fix the game and it will be great soon.
---
I don't expect anything from their current and future updates and I know I will be still disappointed every time how badly they deliver updates and balance fixes to this game. All the same problems are still in the game from update to another update. They really failed with Fallout-brand this time... F076 is like Asylum version of Star Wars movie.
---
They are in the dev room because they want to release them. Like everything that is in the dev room. The main reason they are in the dev room is for testing before release. That's what the dev room is for. But you can just ignore the code and the facts all you want, I don't care lol. 
---
But a head shot with a dragon in sneak and max rifle perks can do a one shot, does that need to be fixed?
---
Did you reply?  Have they responded?
---
Yep, I have. Not the funnest thing in the world but not the hardest either. Just far more time consuming. Unless you cheese it in nuke zones with cocktails.
---
&gt; Can it be more pay to win than that?
---
Dramatically more so, yes.  Like, this is the least P2W you could possibly get.  And it's not even in the game.
---
I was speaking of Big things, not miners, mutants, bugs, regular robots, etc.  I have a lvl 90 Maxed out perks for Heavy gunner, haven't found a TS or E heavy gun yet, let alone TSE, It takes thousands of rounds to put down a lvl 50 SB, or that big bug queen thingy.

---
Yeah pretty much everyone was using the carry weight glitch cause the carry weight is garbage. I used it myself in times of needing to get somewhere hauling junk.
---
**The Big Difference**
---
When I used the carry weight glitch my character could only carry around 225 pounds, but when I used it it is because my weight limit was up to about 280. And to me that is fine. 
---
**The Problem Comes**
---
In when people were crashing servers from duping items to the point they were carrying tens of thousands of pounds. And you could always tell when those people were around cause you would be running some where and pretty much hit a brick wall of lag.
---
**The Exploit -Xp**
---
Yes the good ole xp exloit. Many people were using it sure. But only a handful of people were using it logically. Take myself for example. The only time I used it was when I was say level 29 trying to hit 30, Finish getting the perk card I was after and go back to playing the game. But I remember seeing players that were level 600-800 literally and just thinking "Why".
---
**Today's Exploits**
---
The big thing today seems to be duping and bobble head exploits and stash box exploit (allowing unlimited weight in stash) 
---
Now I personally dont use these glitches. While I don't agree that 600 pounds is enough for a stash box I also don't see the need in havijg thousands of pounds in your box either. Defeats the point of survival if you never have to worry about surviving. 
---
**Big Bad Sheep in Wolves Clothing**
---
I find it isn't a matter that people cant do the glitches as most people have access to youtube and if you look up F76 videos glitches seem to be the first thing that comes up. But more so the people who are abusing the glitches to extremes. 
---
(I.E)
---
Bobble head exploit for insane 1 shot damage on bosses or players. 
---
*Points of Interest*
---
Most players dont care about glitches as most of us use them. But Griefers, Trolls and people with nothing better to do are the ones really giving them a bad rep. Ironically all the players who were duping and using insane 1 shot glitches seem to be all the people who are saying today that the game is boring and needs new content. Like yeah well if you hadn't dupped yourself out of survival mode you would still be playing and grinding and enjoying the game like the rest of us. 
---
*Where was God when we needed a rapture? Watching us all kill each other*
---
This is the only answer that matters
---
Its worth it for the stuff to make ultracite ammo, not been getting awesome drops but had a few 3 star drops. You get a load of hardened and glowing mass and high radiation fluids. It makes sense to farm the golf club and maybe drop a random nuke somewhere that has a high density of the right plants for flux before doing queen
---
Brilliant.
---
That's by design. The perks that make items take up less weight only apply to items in your inventory. As soon as they're in your stash they weigh full again 
---
Oh wow. That’s a big regulation in damage. But it’s understandable. They look like they chop down anything with ease. Haven’t seen anyone use it on another person yet, but I’d imagine they’d be just as effective given the power of melees. 
---
You’re probably right. Not the case with me yesterday though hahaha. I understand this is a PVP game, but some people are just straight up wack. Some level 120+ dude stood in front of my camp taunting me by aiming his fat man at it, and he totally obliterated it. A dude nearby who saw had a TSE handmade, and a couple pops, and the other dude just ran away. Like yeah, it is relatively cheap to repair your camp, but when you’ve got a concrete wall and a camp like mine, it’s quite annoying. Since then, I’ve been looking around for one. I’m tired of getting bullied by these dudes lol. It’s always either my camp or me that gets screwed over.
---
"trial and error phase"
---
Lmao this is bethesda bro.
---
Eh, my conspiracy theory (ie: don't look to hard into it for hard facts) is that while the game designers did do good work. they didn't finish the game.   
---
Though I'm not exactly holding it against them. I don't think they planned on the gaming being like this. My guess is that they were 1/2 way through this game, and were going to actually implement Loot Boxes but had to strip them out and then the game got rushed.
---
Why do I think this? Well, the perk card system seems like it was designed to be monetized. As are the furniture and weapon plans, and the non-permanent magazines and bobbleheads. 
---
While these things weren't monetized, if you look at them with that in mind, they suddenly look VERY suspicious. And then there's the code people found indicating that they intended lootbox style "Lunchboxes", or intended them to the point of putting the code in there but not implementing it.  
---
I think that Bethesda saw what happened with EA and Battlefront 2, what with the public turning on loot boxes and lawmakers across the world going after the practice, and they said "aw hell no" and ripped that out of the game. 
---
So this is the first game that Bethesda Studios Austin ever made that got released. From 2013 to 2017 they were called Battlecry studios and they worked on the failed game "Battlecry" until Bethesda stepped in and canned that game without releasing it. But from the early reviews, it was an uninspired, buggy Team Fortress clone.
---
So in 2017 they are put on a new unnamed FPS project. In march 2018 Bethesda changes the studio's name to "Bethesda Studios Austin" and at that year's E3 they announce that they're putting out Fallout 76 that year.
---
But on release Fallout 76 is broken and half finished. It's really clear now that Fallout 76 was supposed to have loot boxes. The perk card system, and plans/recipes system are built as though you'd be earning these randomly in-game.
---
If they started development of Fallout 76 in Jan 2017, then a year into development they'd see EA shit the bed with Star Wars Battlefront 2, which was horribly monetized that it got loot boxes banned in the EU and under investigation here in the US.
---
So I think Bethesda looked at that, said "shit!" and made Bethesda Austin strip out the loot boxes. Then they realized there wasn't enough left in Fallout 76. Without that micro-transaction revenue the game wouldn't make back enough money, and they didn't want to invest any more in the project. So they cut out everything that wasn't in the game yet. Which would be ALL voiced NPCs, quests, QA testing, server management system, and text chat. 
---
And they DID cut a LOT of content. User's can't do half of the stuff they claimed originally, there are locations that BEG for quest-lines but were left abandoned. Like the space station. Only loot boxes are so hated right now and so dangerous to a game's success that a studio would be willing to gut the game to clear them out.
---
The only thing I really hold against Bethesda is the choice they made. Someone looked at this and had to decide to push it and launch an unfinished game, or to just trash the project and reuse assets and ideas in the next game. And they chose to sell a broken game.  
---
Like I said, this is all my own little consipracy theory. Take it with a LOT OF GRAINS of salt.
---
Skill 0
---
Weapon weight is ridicilous atm. My Dragon weighs 7.8lb and my hunting rifle weighs 17.8
---
The Dragon is surely heavier. 4 barrels and the reload equipment attached to it. 
---
The least p2w would be that it only contained cosmetic items, bot damage buffs lol.... whatever man, have fun with the game idc 
---
So your solution is sorry the games broken and wont let u respawn......so just dont logout there anymore.  That's asinine, I should be able to respawn anywhere else outside of the blast zone.....but couldn't because Bethesda cant fix what they said they already fixed.
---
I guess when I get disconnected 5 seconds after I die and lose all my junk that's my fault also right......
---
Look, I am against the idea of lootboxes in this game, but you're trying to make a mountain out of a molehill with this.  These lunchboxes are not even released or announced to be released, are only in DEV, and don't appear to have any significant impact on the game.  Save your outrage.
---
Paper bags sometimes don't spawn. It's better to use in works containers OR drop something worthless like 1 bullet or a blank Holotape to make sure the bag appears, then transfer whatever else you wanted in the bag.
---
They definitely need to fix this one, it is annoying and well known.
---
I think they balanced it around ammo crafting cost. The .308 round is 5/8/12 and crafts in x12. The .50 round is 12/10/40 and crafts in x100. Meaning .308 is considerably more expensive to craft, and once you factor in Ammo Crafter and Super Duper, the discrepancy is even higher. So they made .50 do less damage, which required the least effort on their part.
---
I play on PC but use a controller. Looking away helps but it’s a hassle. 
---
I had to google this, looks awesome I’m in California can’t believe I’ve never heard of it! 
---
There is no alternate fix. It definitely works as intended. BUT, we all agree the stash box should have a larger capacity in general, so feel your pain.  
---
You know what really grinds my gears? That it shows the weight of items in the stash box as the weight with perk cards equipped. It should just show you its actual weigh. Can be very hard to determine whats filling up your stash box sometime due to that.
---
Did, but I lost whatever junk I was carrying.
---
I dig buddy. Raiders gon raid.
---
Okay. That is all I can pick.. well and level 1. I am not very perceptive. I am just a humble brahmin fertilizer farmer. If you ever need a bag of brahmin poo, just look me up. 
---
So damage buffs, speed buffs, jump height buffs have no impact on the game? LOL
---
How do people even use LMG with how prohibitive crafting .308 is? Am I missing something?
---
&gt; You can buy them in bundles
---
No, you can't.  I don't care if the code is there, it's not live and they haven't announced it, so getting upset now looks idiotic.  Save it.
---
From what I've seen and heard they appear to be One-Way Exits from nuke launch sites
---
Ammo is likely NOT on the list.  It's easy to come by can't be sold to vendors.
---
Could you do a build Tutorial?Its a really cool base!
---
Bulking, to my knowledge, doesnt reduce weight. It does make it so that you can easily sell it to a vendor though. 
---
Was talking to a fellow employee where I work and he asked me if I was still playing FO76. Told him I was and he said that he just couldnt get into it. I asked him why, was it the bugs and glitches or what didnt he like about it? He told me that he got it so he could play with his friends on console mainly and after he did a few events and the one that really turned him off of it was he completed an event with some guys and then when they were going around looting, a bunch of guys came out of hiding and just started killing everyone. I said that was pretty shitty. he said hellmprobably buy it for pc and asked how everyone was on there. Told him in the 200hrs Ive played I think I maybe came across two guys who were trying to be dicks but for the most part, like you said, we either ignore eachother or just give away stuff. He talked about eso and how that game was shit to start and now its pretty good game to play. Agreed and said theyre really trying to fix everything and said to wait until spring-ish and then pick it up that way there are some more patches under the belt and should be a good start again that time. 
---
You called it, small groups have no issue it's when everyone shows up......at that point without TSE she wont die
---
Tonight i begin my 5th try on Poseidon. I can get perfect start with 36 minutes left on the timer. No generator plans yet. 
---
-*sigh*-
---
What platform?
---
From what I've seen, none of it. Bulking your junk increases its weight, and wastes plastic because you dont get the plastic back upon breaking it down again.
---
Its true in regards to Fallout 4. I couldn't say if it stayed the same in Fo76
---
&gt; you were not taking into consideration the ENTIRE population. 
---
I certainly was. And you are not taking into consideration the millions of people that work more than 40 hours per week and people with multiple jobs (over 15,000,000 of them).
---
It's also quite silly of you to take the number of toddlers into consideration when were are discussing a game with a Mature 17+ rating.
---
Unyielding+1Str armor, bloodied weapon, all damage mutations, glowing meat, psychobuff, radicool, nerd rage, adrenaline. I can hit 42 strength with everything proc’ed
---
I have so many guns I store because they’re too heavy to justify carrying around. Til they nerf two shot and explosive...and some of those will be trash at that point. 
---
If you're regularly crafting or diluting stimpacks, taking walking pharmacy is a must. 
---
&gt; I don't think nerfing two-shots and explosive weapons is the right idea, i think it'll backfire and make a lot of people feel less inclined to play. 
---
People will claim that. but it's seldom true. They will just work to find something else to replace this. 
---
It does reduce weight, by quite a lot actually.
---
Hermit crabs get to live, they’re adorbs.
---
I found an instigating explosive double barrel. That gun is EXTREMELY broken.
---
Yeah ive had this issue, its when im solo because of the mutations i have i think lol. I can still take them down pretty quick, especially if/when they land, but the bitch scream attck fucks me up big time 😂 . In a group, not so much. The same attack does minimal damage when in a team with mutants
---
Ah, I see what you mean. 
---
That threw me off as well, I just stick with my hardened receiver at .308, I pick up enough ammo to keep myself stocked from scorched.
---
and people still, literally have ptsd from it.
---
Why not both? 
---
Have you used a mirv fatman to kill a wanted person yet? I felt kinda bad for the level 15 I did it too for 10 caps but it was hilarious
---
Yeah, both have their risks and rewards, the problem is with range the reward isn't really there. Melee is just fun, building up to 2 shot a scorchbeast is just epic.  
---
Ranged, well knowing that 200 rounds is enough to clear one or two areas, when you could just go melee deal with the high risk high reward and explore to your hearts content. IT just isn't worth it the amount of ammo used and the fact ranged builts are generally less durable jsut leads to problems.   
---
IT all boils down to the gun play just not being fun. 
---
A set of reasons for the ban, in a drop down menu, that autofills the email text.
---
I think they nerfed it. 
---
do you get the well fed bonus with cannibalized perk?
---
Mean but true. 
---
This is exactly the information I was looking for. Thank you! 
---
And you're all out of caps to buy things in bulk?
---
I think it's to stop people from looting other peoples supply drops.
---
\#asseatinszn
---
Oh no 25 caps is gone!
---
Nobody is getting upset lol. I stated facts, proven by code and YouTube. I never said I was upset about it. I said I was disappointed but I guess you have no idea about the difference between being upset and disappointed. 
---
Is it still bugged to where the plans for the Barn set and Advanced Power Connectors have the same name?
---
I one-shot snallygasters from stealth (plain 2x + instigating lever rifle headshot). Not sure about wendigos because they don't tend to be wandering around in the open, but they go down fast enough anyway. I can also kite those groups of five level 50 glowing mirelurk kings fairly comfortably, when they run over my melee buddy.
---
Melee certainly has more dpm (especially post-TSE nerf) but I'm not sure that it's strictly *unbalanced*. Stimpaks are mostly sale goods for me.
---
Sir or Ma'am I would be more than happy to move my Brahmin Poo factory into your settlement. I currently got me 3 brahmin, thats 6 head. All I ask is that no one kill my shit machines. I am on PS4. 
---
I've made a video about this, I created a multi-level 'stairwell'. Check it out:
---
[https://youtu.be/vp5IWFBE9Jw](https://youtu.be/vp5IWFBE9Jw)
---
No, sorry I have an Ivory Grip Revolver plan you can have though
---
Does the single action revolvers have upgrades beyond a ivory handle?
---
Well that’s subjective, but I totally agree that the ammo grind is real. 
---
I think rifle gaming (correct me if I am wrong) has a series on YouTube where he has been nuking new locations to see if there are any hidden bosses or events and so far he has nuked several places only to find out it is a wasted nuke. So for the most part people continue with WSGC and SBQ
---
Yeah totaly did it, after 50hours and then another 300 hours i was standing in camp on place lol.
---
No way to know that these mods don't trigger something they're looking for.
---
Using mods is a rash decision on a new game like this if they're unofficial.
---
My assumption is that it's either that or the fact that it's from the back, the fact that there was a level disparity between characters, pvp damage works differently, or they changed the formula. But honestly there's no way to know without insane testing or data mining. And it's possible data mining couldn't even find it because I'd personally expect damage calculations to be server sided to prevent people from hacking damage on the client side.
---
But the missile launcher is not a super powerful weapon. Least not last time I played.
---
As a sniper build who always goes for head shots... its never a problem. 
---
Then again.. i can go afk with chamelon and super sneak skills and most mobs will walk right by me.
---
Satisfying as hell to bare fist punch a super mutant and seeing it explode. 
---
I'm not sure I even do, if social skills/pop culture awareness were important and one could be considered disabled if they didn't get that stuff, I'd likely have a social worker with how bad I am with that sorta thing lol, I just felt like replying in kind cause 'why the fuck not'
---
Good points dude to be honest and sorry if this seem like a highjack of post the dupe problem could of been solved in the first patch. You needed to craft 300 items to disconnect you and the solution they came up with was change the limit to 255. Why didn't they just change it to 5. Problem would of been dealt with within a week. 
---
And it's not like they couldn't change the build limit because they did it twice before finally sorting it out. It's the main thing that confused me with the whole situation. 
---
The fact serum plans got duped is a massive problem because they are possibly the hardest item to get and they have lost value and it's a damn shame. Weapons is a problem but as you said at least people got to try out different builds without screwing themselves over. 
---
And now I'm going to brace myself for the down votes. 
---
Its in the friggin fallout ether now man!! Never to be seen again.......you could always try buying Skyrim in VR across multiple platforms, that might fix it 👍
---
It's listed in the initial post.
---
I never knew .50 does less damage, but I did notice in Fallout 4 that .50 doesn't do nearly what it should, and .308 doesn't really either, unfortunately.
---
I did see a few of those. Yeah hopefully Bethesda changes something
---
Per the Wiki - It seems like it reduces more weight than it does, because you consume plastic to bulk. However, bulking aluminum and lead does reduce weight. And as you say, it helps with inventory management in general - You can bulk and sell to a vendor, and if you have 25 bulk of something, well, you know you don't have to acquire as much of X out in the wild. 
---
Killing the enemy solves iT for me.
---
ALIENS!
---
Except for lead and aluminium it weighs more. Its to sell to vendors. 
---
Use the white knight perk under agility to *significantly* reduce the armor degradation and the amount of materials to repair. 
---
I recommend trying the Poseidon energy plant in the Forest - it's the lowest level of them and at 61 you really should be able to solo it. If you can't then there's something fundamentally wrong with your build - your perk choices, your weapons, armor, etc.
---
Haha, I remember looking at the lead scrapped from the weights and the lesser weight gave more lead than the heavier ones. 
---
Now you and I are on the same ideal here. I can see what your saying with why you think they did the nerf. I hope that is why because it just seemed like with the timing of it that it was done to give the victims of griefers a peace of mind. Hinch the dup connection that I was talking about. like you said regardless of anything else the duped loot needs to go away !
---
Whitesprings is appealing because it sure is easy.  You spawn just yards away from a door that will bring a couple dozen mobs right to you, perfect for AoE attacks.  I have a double-barrel explosive shotgun that cleans them all up pretty nicely.
---
One problem is that the vast majority of your legendaries are 1-star garbage.  I've gotten a few nice rifles from there (quad handmade, TS assault rifle).  The other problem is that it's heavily farmed so I often have to load in a few times to get a respawn of the proper level.
---
Looking over your guide, there are several that i'm seeing that have known locations. Can verify, because i have found them in the same location multiple times, with nothing else there. (I appologize in advance for not knowing the names of all of the locations, just know where a lot of things spawn/can be found.)  
---
Brain Bombs - Food Vendor bot in the Whitesprings  
---
Cranberry Meatball Grinder - Food Vendor bot in the Whitesprings  
---
Delbert's bunless cramburger - in the kitchen in the steakhouse next to robco research center  
---
Delbert's corn pone - in one of the stalls at the amusement park next to the dirt track workshop in the forest  
---
Disease Cure (Mire) - can be found in one of the rooms of the treetop village, not to be confused with treehouse that is also in the mire  
---
Seared Venison with Berries - Food Vendor bot in the Whitesprings  
---
Assaultron Blade - drops from assaultron units (same with the electrified blade mod)  
---
Garage door - can be found laying out in the open on the ground at the location directly next to missle silo charlie  
---
Any of the generator plans can be gotten from completing "Power up X" quests. Each time you complete one, you get a new generator plan, until you have them all.  
---
Mr handy buzz blade - drops from my handy units (same with the electrified blade mod)  
---
All the "prime receivers" drop from the SBQ  
---
I'll add to this more when I have more time to look over your spreadsheet. All in all, good job and thank you for the work you put into it.
---
I think it's probably you who doesn't have knowledge in this area. They don't have to rewrite code to change damage on a weapon. They go into the Creation Kit, open the record for the weapon/effect/armor/whatever they want to change, and then change the damage value. 
---
You're also apparently assuming that every coder makes a mistake every time they change something, which is absurd.
---
Explosive is not powerful by itself by any means, I have a TSE Handmade and I have a bloodied Explosive handmade, the "OP" damage comes from the combination of legendary modifiers, and incorrectly calculated demolitions expert. 
---
If they fix the demolition perk to the right % calculation that will bring to light where some of the extra damage is coming from I believe i read in another post its ~50% more then it should be receiving from Demo expert. Essentially what I am saying is Explosive becomes over powered with incorrectly calculated perks. Do a comparison between a TSE and just an explosive weapon of the same arch type weapon and test it, with and without demolitions expert.
---
And what is every villians greatest aspiration? To have an arch nemesis that challenges them, look at Wile coyote and the Roadrunner, if the coyote had stomped the roadrunner in the first episode, the coyote would have become fat and lazy instead of challenging himself everday to hopefully one day stomp the Roadrunner.
---
A true villian can only become their best by having someone challenge them. Picking on the weak and defenseless makes for short term fun, but in the long run your just making less people get to the point they can challenge you, and your going to end up with no challenges and get bored.
---
Been said Duping happening now was a good thing. If this Fallout 76 is going be the last Fallout for the next 5-10 years. Forces them to fix the game. Forces them to make better weapons and armor at higher level.
---
The issues I have is Two Shot Explosive Weapons are not over powered. The issue is Demolitionist shouldn’t give guns with Explosive 100% Damage buff. It should only give like a 25% boost to guns. Then Bethesda need to fix the Bobblehead and Magazine stacking that allowed people to be op in PVP. Bethesda also need to fix shotguns because each pellet is treated as an individual bullet. Also the Bobblehead Exploit is used by Melee also
---
The problem is TSE are the poster child for duping. When Melee weapons and Amor and other things was duped just as much.
---
Then the other issue is Melee build have been way more powerful then guns since Alpha and beta testing. They still are. I have a friend that has a 2 Handed Melee build that hit 12,000 Dps. They are more powerful then any gun build.
---
The argument I get is guns for range. Have you ever PVPed a Melee User in Power Armor with Twisted Muscles,Speed Demon and Marsupial? With Nerd Rage ? They are almost impossible to kill or hit with the lag in the game.
---
These are just my opinions and I gave a post on how to fix it yesterday. I will edit and link it here in a few mins.
---
It adds more space to carry stuff, but it doesn't make it less heavier, thus in no way it allows you to carry more, than you physically can.
---
Said mod @ Nexus : [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124)

I just found them last week!  But they were dead, along with momma. 
---
Shed dwellers must die
---
Also as a PSA: A bunch of junk, you can't bulk, so check your inventory. I had hundreds of some of the stuff that I either sold to vendors or just ditched in the wild. The list of non-bulkable junk from the Wiki: antiseptic, abseptos, ballistic fiber, black titanium, circuity, crystal, fiber optics, fiberglass, flux, gold, nuclear material, screws, silver and ultracite. (Obviously, some of that you don't ever want to sell, but some of that isn't used for much in the game.)
---
They've been in a while, there is a random encounter where you come across an adult fighting some Yao Guai with a few dead baby sloths nearby, is sad.
---
Also: I know the source of the sloths, they come from &gt;!One of the mansions in the ash heap, iirc it's the one for the owners of the company that made the Excavator power armor, there are a number of large zoo style cages in the 'first' floor of it (up the elevator) one of which has a crate labeled 'Sloth Food' in big, brass letters!&lt;
---
I believe you can only have one food buff active at a time, don't quote me on that though. For the most part, i only use food to keep my guy alive. Except for booze.. Cranberry Moonshine all the way.
---
Lol...I'll give ya an upvote.
---
They didn't, that patch says that Overdrive wasn't increasing the crit chance properly.
---
I usually just claim workshops for the random plans they give, do the "defend" event that pops shortly after the claim, get the other items  for that completion and then move on. Other guys can have the workshop if they want it. 
---
Yes, I would also like this so my two shot and vampiric assaultron heads can come out of the stash.
---
30% damage bonus on a weapon that does 100 damage.
---
I wonder how many people will be online hacking away at the Whitesprings slot machine when all of the legendary perks are shit?
---
Even casinos understand that you've gotta have winners every once in a while.
---
Awe man that sucks, I'm sure I've thrown away tons not know what was worth what 😓
---
You know you bought a Bethesda game right? 
---
Production I believe 
---
Actually: go for the Western Revolver, it's a better gun over all, and has more potential
---
Should we comment the event answers here?
---
1.) Bring back feed the people as it was...feeding the people! Do you have any idea how happy it made me sometimes to open my aid and see that randomly and occasionally? It was so rewarding the way it was.
---
2.) The messenger. I can not even begin to express my frustration with this event. Do you have any idea how many times I've failed this, because the messenger would get stuck or go on a weird route? Got stuck In a harpers ferry house. I followed the entire time. He looped inside that house like 15 times. I failed because of issues like that plenty of times. Another time it got stuck on a cliffside, and proceeded to stay there until fail.
---
The war reenactment is essentially never done as well.
---
3.) No preference really. 
---
4.) Better, more challenging hoard events. More creative ones.
---
5.) If I see an event already happening that I like, fast travel. But I will go to start them too.
---
6.) Good
---
Yep. The point that I discovered that was the point where I decided that I needed to max out cannibal and never unequip it.
---
My multi-level stairwell method might be helpful: [https://youtu.be/vp5IWFBE9Jw](https://youtu.be/vp5IWFBE9Jw)
---
Oh lord.  I know its sucks to lose stuff, but really.  Lvl2 guns?  Cant u just walk to the next blding and pick another one up?
---
Enough with the drama queen shit
---
It's definitely different but there's aspects of FO76 that you'd never get in a single player game. Yesterday I went back and forth with another player in PVP and it was really fun. At the same time I've finished the main story line and it wasn't anything special, especially without NPC's.
---
Blah blah blah projection something something potmeetkettle.jpg
---
I'm missing the Forrest Hat, are you on Xbox by chance?
---
Great idea, and definitely a point I've considered. Currently only power armor is worth hunting the recipes for. be Now, If only there were late game, hard to kill creatures or some end game boss that could have legendary mods or recipes added to a loot list to make them worth the actual effort it takes to kill them
---
..
---
*Wipes away tears with plan: ultracite explosive vents*
---
Xbox - Possibly other systems. The fire barrel light really shouldn't be such a cool blue hue. I miss the warm firey color from Fallout 4.
---
Works for me too
---
No, not at all. It's a pain, but I'd rather have a larger house/more decorations and furnishings.
---
It's all the screws, springs, and gears it takes to install it. LOL
---
I typically do the quest to take the workshop and then the quest to defend. Then I move on to another location.
---
I’m only doing it for camp plans, not the actual resources.
---
I have about 8 of those but thankya my man.
---
Good point. Until I hung out with them I had no idea how it was done. A lot of it revolves around real world $
---
I think so yeah!
---
I've also gotten that one, I think I got it from technical data but can't say for certain
---
Prefer the look of the SAR my mans
---
I always make sure i am not carrying any junk when i log out. 
---
I was fuming. 
---
I refuse to kill foxes, possums, or cats. I have only seen one sloth and avoided it bc I was too low level for the area to begin with, but if they are non-aggressive I doubt I will attack them unless demanded to by a quest.
---
Squirrels and rabbits I kill in game bc I can't bring myself to take out the real life ones that destroy my garden. 🤷
---
You can only have 1 food and 1 drug active at a time
---
Fingers crossed! We‘ve all been told about that one post our whole life. Maybe this is it!!! 
---
Post link. 
---
Thought that is "Tank Killer"?
---
Yah I wasnt mad the nuke hit me....I was mad I couldn't even respawn at another location to go get my junk.......that's just horrible design.
---
Well it seems they may have changed their minds about fixing it then.
---
Yeah this definitely needs to be implemented in the game. Crafted a shit ton of ammo today with ammosmith lvl1 on because i got it in a perk pack and i wasnt looking hard enough at what lvl card i was equiping 
---
I've also gotten that one, but this list was mostly for outfits that go over armor. I lot of people have been wanting a gallery for under armor so I'll see if I get around to that or not and thanks!
---
4 missile turrets and 2 Heavy machine gun ones deters almost everyone  
---
Interesting read - I'm rolling with an anti-armor super sledge -- Might be able to free up 3 slots and take incisor out of Strength.
---
I have recently learned that if I have a workshop and someone goes to claim my workshop, I am thus flagged in pvp with them despite having pacifist mode enabled. This allows them to seek me out on the map and then attack and kill me while my settings are still on pacifist mode. This auto-flagging is leading to griefing and harassment by high level players looking for ways to troll and harass players by flagging them and killing them anywhere on the map without having any intention or desire to actually take their workshops. This needs to be urgently stopped. It forces me into a pvp situation where I am actively seeking to avoid it. And as such is a game mechanic, it leads me to believe the players doing the harassment and griefing will not be punished because it's a "gameplay mechanic."
---
The packs give them to you whether you want them or not though so I have a bunch of garbage perk cards I will never use or just have extras of perks I have maxed already. If we can have some kind of trade in system would be nice to get rid of some and clear up room so I dont have to cycle through them all when Im switching them out during crafting or what not. 
---
I believe long barrels cost more ap in vats.  That would be the only downside I think.
---
Will add you but dont have codes and a mic atm
---
Came here to say this and you stole my thunder. Take your upvote.
---
That works for me. If you’re short by a few mats I’ll take care of it, no problem 
---
1 str = 5% damage.
---
You’d have to actually look at tooltip in game though because I don’t know if both modifiers occur in the same place in the calculation.
---
Having to do so is not a solution, it's something they should fix.  And that's impossible to do when half my logouts are from the game crashing, little hard to stash junk then.
---
5lbs of screws and tape
---
If you pick up your camp and move it, even just a couple inches, your broken items will be in storage fully repaired. 
---
When people who do this meet me and the community I am apart of they tend to server transfer next to immediately. Putting turrets in white springs is selfish and stupid, neither you nor other players get xp if the turrets kill the mob. Why even do this? 
---
when we see this the grieving ensues and we force the player to leave, I love hunting these people. 
---
They have Anti Armor Guns and Weapons.
---
Tank Killer perk exists for rifles and some weapons have armor piercing magazine mods
---
dont worry i got the code
---
Plasma grenades would work well for this. 
---
Talons and Twisted Muscles both affect unarmed damage, this makes up for the 40% damage difference available from perk cards(although unarmed has higher base damage and faster swing speeds)
---
This right here, i have 2 tses and have no problems with them being nerfed, it's good for the balance of the game, it's too easy with the, was already thinking of selling them and buying AA-Bloodied-Furious weapons instead.
---
Just make sure not to venture out to the wilderness on the very bottom right of the map.  There be bears, lots of them...
---
If you want to really feel like you are in power armor, and be both happy and scared about it, go up against bears.  I had two level 68 bears clanging against my power armor at level 81 and I ran out of stimpaks...   I died...  they tag-teamed me and kept staggering me.  
---
I came back, took them out with All Rise, and got my stuff back.  But I had to ingest a large amount of chems to buff up, still without stims.  They were already injured so it was easier. 
---
Yup played last night and enjoyed it alot. Read this news before going to bed and this morning uninstall the game and will never touch it again. I could see a nerf but not to the point where my weapon should say "fires an additional rubber projectile" and "flash bang". I will now trash fallout 76 every chance I get. 
---
For a single enemy, no it isn't all that great. But killing one can aggro the other pack of 4 to you and the gun is not that quick to get off shots. You also lose the sneak bonus. So, with a pack of 4 coming after you rather fast, aiming down a scope isn't exactly a guarantee. That is when you pull out the shotty and cripple the legs of the 4 and finish at your own time. 
---
But for just one regular mob, yea, not worth it.  Or if they are hiding behind cover pot-shotting. Everything is conditional obviously. I am just speaking from my experience. 
---
No need to remind. Just empty threats. I'd probably be playingright now if I didn't have to get an oil change. 
---
Yah exactly.....sorry it was out fault.....to bad.
---
PSN is phreak11 my bad
---
Why didn't you just say thing to begin with? "Gun play is not fun"?
---
Ammo - Ammo is a HUGE reason I swapped to melee. I got sick of taking time to farm mats to make ammo to just run out in the same day.
---
Complain about the shitty mechanics Bethseda implemented instead of trying to complain about melee. Do you want everything to suck? Because shit like this post is how you get everything nerfed to the ground. 
---
And I think many would disagree w you about gunplay not being fun, I have a blast sniping things from stealth. And like I said in my other post in here. I never had a legendary rifle until after I swapped to a melee build. I always had fun when shooting before I changed to melee. Now I have more fun as melee because I can play and not worry about getting lead/steal and swapping my cards out all the dam time for Super Duper and Ammo Master or whatever the hell its called. Swapping perk cards out all the time just to make ammo is super fun amiright. Also doing nothing but farming for ammo is super fun too!! Horray. Bethseda fucked up a lot w this game and, to me, ammo farming is one of them. And there are MANY other fuck ups. 
---
My idea of an auction house is a bit different... you go there, where you find a "special" vendor, you give to him the object you want to sell setting a minimum price, then you can go away to do your stuff. Anyone passing by can make an offer, starting a timer before the object is sold at the best offer. It's a bit different than standing still waiting for someone who wants to check your inventory. People will visit the hub (it does not necessarily  have to be whitespring) to check the unique vendors (selling good stuff in order to attract more people), accept the daily quests (they need to have some good rewards for the same reason) and to make offers or sell at the auction house. I think all of this would lead to a lot more interaction between players
---
That’s the exact event that I came across then, and these two were dead also. Sad indeed, it’d be awesome to have one at your camp, ha.  Your source got blacked out, but I’m hoping we find alive ones at some point.
---
It would appear so lol
---
yeah, they know about it.  Apparently the issue is the data getting wiped when you log out.  
---
so you may have gotten the reward in a session, but anything that accumulates per session you lose.  
---
Is my understanding right now.
---
My point is that the bare shelves, racks, etc. should never have been in the game in the first place. They should have updated the Fallout 4 models to account for the fact that we couldn't stock them ourselves in the first place. A different shelf texture than a straights mindless, lazy, recycle wouldn't have had any impact on stability.
---
This is just so great 👍
---
There's a whole "What do you want to see for events" thread from Bethesda in their own forums, everyone should go reply to it bc that gets sent to the devs directly.
---
Nope, no turrets and rarely have to fend it off, maybe 1 in 10 times I go to it.  
---
I do understand your frustration, no one should be able to log in in the middle of a blast zone.
---
I think bethesda will fix that in the future
---
Nah I just surrounded my camp with a high foundation wall and moved my crops indoors. Nothing for a turret to guard.
---
That completely fucked me and I'm still a little salty about it, though I suppose I can make do with brick
---
An easy fix would have been to only affect real explosive weapons ie Fat Man, Grenade, Missile launcher and Grenades.
---
For, I am, the God of Thunder..... stealing.
---
Don’t know about that, but a general 3x damage for everyone (AI and players alike) could be pretty damn interesting.   
---
They had mods for that in F04.  
---
Combat becomes a lot more tactical when everyone is less spongey 
---
No, I don't bother. In the beginning I splashed out and had one, two at one point I think. But I figured no real point and way too budget heavy.
---
Players intent on destroying my camp are not going to be deterred by them. They're going to get a bounty anyway, so they'll just destroy them. And the wasteland enemies do pretty much the same depending who they are (looking at you, the super mutant horde who practically flattened my camp one day).
---
Besides my turrets killed the cat who took up residence in my camp once. Never again will I have turrets. I can't bear the thought of killing cats.
---
Well what I was doing wasn't so much "picking on him" as it was 
---
~~taking a valuable resource from him because he was weaker than me~~
---
Wait that sounds bad
---
~~Targeting his workshop because I could take it easily and he couldn't defend himself~~
---
Nope bad again. Hold on
---
~~Laughing maniacally while teabagging his exploded turrets~~
---
Almost there
---
Taking several junk deposits because I really needed to make my power armor while squashing an annoying any who tried to bite me
---
I made a play list on Apple Music including a lot of my favorite songs from the Appalachia Radio. 
---
But I really think it would be fun to be able to collect holo tapes of the various songs in game and be able to load them in the juke box or make a playlist in your pip boy from the ones you collected.
---
Have a quad shot tracking missile launcher that weighs 39.6 lbs
---
it's funny, every time I come  here, there's a post by some elitist douchebag who doesn't like it when people make posts taht would improve \_their\_ game experience if he thinks it would change \_his\_ in a way he doesn't happen to like. 
---
Oh! Thanks for clarifying. Was wondering what the issue was. Big help man
---
Now that has never happened to me and definitely sounds like a real bug. I’ve never had anything pulled from my stash when I was free of junk and died. Thats the entire purpose of the stash. None of my friends have ever shared any experience like this either. If I were you Id experiment with this and record the results, send it to bethesda. This definitely should not be happening to you.
---
I used to use a bunch, missile and heavy mg and spotlights but it was really overkill. Now I'm down to 2 strategically placed hmg turrets that are handy for pest control. Apparently workstations are an important part of a well balanced mole rat diet.
---
Do you have the component search feature thing setup so it shows the magnifying glass on desirable items?
---
That was intention good sir, as it's a spoiler for a location, so I put a spoiler tag on that bit so people could see it if they wanted but didn't need too
---
If you're comfortable using a mod there is one called Better Inventory and it breaks down every single weight and displays it.
---
Like "Stimpak (50) Weight .25 (12.5) Also gives you category summary. 
---
I started using it because on the fly its just easier. 
---
I never felt quite so dirty in 76 as when a random cat gave me my final test for the Blade of Bastet...
---
To be honest, it gets boring pretty quick. One shot almost any regular sized monster.  Mine is similar to many others, +2 str on Power Armor chest, I don't bother with mutations (I'm lazy), I haven't bothered with anything but Instigating or Anti-Armor legendaries (experimented with taking off Incisor perk and putting on more damage.  
---

---
All Rise (the freebie Super Sledge from the BoS quest) does 346
---
Instigating Sledgehammer (no other legendary effect) does 317 or 634 to a mob with full health
---
Fire Axe (Anti-Armor, +1 STR, +50% limb dam) does 315.  
---
I'm sure with a regular armor setup you could get some even nicer legendary effects. Further, unarmed weapons seem to do a ridiculous amount per medium speed swing. I also have the perk cards for Heavy Weapons and carry a Furious Gatling for Scorchbeasts. Yeah, none of these are great legendaries but the character is pretty boring because it's so easy to play. I wish we have a "Very Hard" or "Survival" difficulty. This feels like 'normal' in FO4.
---
Anybody know where to fine the regular helmet plan? Haven't seen it yet.
---
Same here, it was a bummer because I quickly equipped the animal/whisperer perks for the mom but then the closer I got they ended up all dead.
---
I am not the Bureau of Labor Statistics, if you have a beef with their numbers take it up with them. I could have very well spent hours pouring over DLS and Census data to give a breakdown that would concisely given the averages, but my point in all this was to give you a rough explanation on why the data given by the BLS in my original response was, in fact, accurate. I am sure those statisticians spent much more time on their report than I did writing a quick Reddit comment in the amount of time it took for me to drink a cup of coffee. My biggest point in all this was very simply, just because disagree with facts doesn't mean they aren't true. I was just giving a very rough idea of how those figures were compiled - mostly because i was a data analyst in another life and immediately grokked it.  
---
I fail to see how mentioning that toddlers are in fact people has anything to do with an ESRB rating though. That response is very confusing. I think you might be confused by the concept of averages that I am gently trying to explain to you. The fact that you took my quib about how sleep varies and applied an average that was based on an off-the-cuff remark rather than actual data signifies you might be. I have no idea why you offered the average of these but, hey good on you for knowing it was 7.5 regardless.  
---
If you feel the argument you made was stupid, then i am not one to poke at your further. 
---
Fair enough, iirc harper ferry vendor has it at times
---
Meh...not as much as you think....this nurf will force more folks to build melee builds that actually are more powerful then any gun build.    
---
A personal real world threat, this gets a user report on Reddit.
---
Rock Out w/Guitar 4 lyf.
---
Yea base weight on a crafted handmade is 11.2 lbs I added 12lbs worth of mods to get a total weight of 23.2 lbs. 
---
Now the legendary after having it modded for months weighs 16lbs.
---
I haven't and probably won't remove all mods and reset the legendary back to base to see what the base weight would be. (I just don't want to waste mats at this point)
---
But if it worked by only effecting base gun it should weight 1.12 lbs plus 12 in mods making it around 13.12 lbs but it weighs 16lbs so like I said something is fucky.
---
Honestly I think the game might benefit from a thing like Division/runescape/eso/WoW where maybe two consenting players can pvp wherever but there are full on PVP zones where you are automatically flagged for entering
---
The enemies in this game are too braindead for that. They can only be hard hitting bullet sponges. 
---
Its just going to make unattached mods heavier. Its a game mechanic, not a proof of conservation of mass.
---
I just used Glowing Meat as my example because its so abundant that I always have it on me 100% of the time. AWildMutfruit should be correct on 5% per 1 Str so its about even with other buffs. I will be checking to see if Carnivore Mutation increases the buffs you get from food later.
---
So with that perk can you feed off of already dead bodies that you find in the wasteland?
---
This doesnt happen
---
I personally never did any of those glitches. But I did conveniently log off and back on if I needed more carry weight or my fusion core recharged. Hehe. The way I saw it, those good bugs were/are quality of life, and made up for all of the bad bugs I endured.
---
I approve of all aspects of this conversation.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
That's my only point, and at a minimum let me respawn somewhere....anywhere.....hell the vault.
---
But because the game considered me overweight, I wasnt able to spawn anywhere but the closest location....which was in the blast zone and not able to be spawned into.
---

I guess he could be a nightkin since they wouldn't have lost thier mindd yet. Except they were created by the master, and I'm not sure he exists yet. 
---
What is wrong with powerful don't nerf 1 thing buff all the crappy things like heavies, autos, all the crappy useless mods, the crappy legendary mods nerfing suck makes people salty buff the bad to make it good don't need the good to be bad
---
I've broken down over 15 of them and I have never seen mods other than ivory handle
---
Yeah I've been checking. Thanks for the ups! Ill keep trying
---
Game is effed. Good luck
---
Same. ~sigh~ 
---
Ohh shoot, lol.  New to Reddit didn’t know you could click it.   I appreciate that feature  but your info more, ha.
---
Huh?
---
To the lvl 50+ 25 caps is pocket change, to the lvl 21 who barely just broke 1k caps its a lot.
---
An example, I took charleston, someone else captured it from me, so my 25 cap investment was gone, no biggy. Lost 26 caps dying once attempting to retake it, went away for a bit and watched them leave, recapped it at a cost of 57 caps because of the structures I had built. So this one encounter cost me 10% of the total caps I had. I made the choice to spend those caps and I am fine with that aslong as its somebody my lvl ish thats taking it from me, when the person has 50+ lvls on me and is only capping it to be a jerk is when I have issues.
---
I like most of this, I don't think we should have to pay to change. I think we already paid in a way by taking the lvl an card and then taking it again and again. So I've already spent three points to the special and I made the card a lvl 3, I should be able to just take one back an use it as a lvl 2 or lvl 1 and then use different cards I have in waiting. I shouldn't have to get the card three more times to have it as lvl 1 and then one as lvl 2 also.
---
Is it possible you had saw it when adrenaline was up? I know my TSE gauss is around 1500 damage, 1300 without the prime receiver with just demo expert, bloody mess, and riflemen effecting it damage wise. 
---
Haha thank you!
---
Look at all these butthurt Babyfaces downvoting you, cant even laugh about a Joke.

Here take a Upvote.

games hard
---
I have been thinking about this a bunch lately. I think the area surrounding Gorge Junk Yard would be a good location. The workshop has concrete, wood, junk, and there are some more resource nodes around that area.
---
I'm level 80 but for some reason the game still hasn't registered that I left Vault 76.
---
"it just works"
---
Some of the weapon weights are totally ridiculous, like a homemade that weighs as much as a missile launcher ugh 
---
put mats in your inventory
---
Seems a little heavy on that TSE salt.

As in not a single plan for any genny? Like no windmill or large?

I don’t know the specifics, however, I fought the SBQ yesterday. Too many players showed up so she had a huge amount of health. 
---
My quad explosive shotgun wasn’t doing ANY damage, at least not enough to be noticeable. I switched over to my Furious Handmade, and after about 100 rounds, it *looked* like I was beginning to do a considerable amount of damage. At least, I could actually see her health bar decreasing a noticeable amount. 
---
This is, however, after she glitches and permanently landed without moving or attacking again for about five minutes and I was able to repeatedly shoot her without missing. 
---
Unfortunately for both of us, ps4

I would actually like this change... if the drops contents were better (possible legendary drops?)
---
I would like to see changes that encourage PvP (that ofc is completely optional). Buffing the workshops would be another such change.

Noooooo

Everything seems to do that, when my friends become "Wanted", sometimes for damaging their own CAMP, we always ask them to remove their Armor before killing them, not to make killing them easier, but to spare their armor any damage.
---
Or, follow these simple steps for fast armor damage:
---
1. Leave all junk in your stash
---
2. Equip all explosive buffing Perk cards
---
3. Equip explosive Shotgun, (TS not required)
---
4. Point Down, &amp; pull trigger button
---
5. Re-spawn, legs should be messed up for sure.
---
If you do this in another players CAMP, some of your other armor will quickly get damaged as well.
---
no problem, you can also get plans from the treasure maps, ash heap/savage devide may drop the weapon plan, where as the ivory grips plan can be found in treasure piles in The Forest

What if a trash account got to the room, teamed with someone on a mule account and the mule fast traveled to them?

They ban the obvious hacker, but since they can't prove the mule player intentionally knew he wasnt supposed to there, they just issue a temporary ban.

I have two heavy lasers. I find that's a good amount to have, while still giving enough budget for everything I wanted to build. Gotta have something to protect my brahmin before it dies for the 347th time.
---
I agree
---
Right? You can favorite them as an indication, but I need my favorite item slots 
---
I keep forgetting I have it... haven't used it once.
---
Honestly I still don't see how duping kills the in game market unless people wanted to charge an exorbitant amount for them... I can see if it affects gameplay then yea OK but that's not the only cause we're they op the tse weapons yea but challenging gameplay is what makes you get accustomed and learn right
---
They needed to be nerfed but I think they over did it a bit and should have buffed others to make it competitive that's just my 2
---
Shotgun perks are related to Strength so probably better being in there. But that all sounds good to me.
---
.44’s do more damage? Like in real life
---
wow I just tested this out and you're right.   amazing.  BGS is amazingly bad lol
---
My nigga

Same. I noticed that the more items I have, the longer it takes to load/pip to not freeze.
---
Someone at my school said that. Huh
---
I had 12 nuclear launch cards that I optioned from shooting cargobots and looting the contents.  I've not yet launched a nuke.
---
I logged on the other day and had 5 launch cards.  
---
I miss my wooby.
---
Ive been wrecking around 12 bases a day :D Anyone whos Enclave or BOS watch out, I shoot on site.
---
Yeah but it's not a 100% guaranteed solution as you might run low on ammo, die, the enemy might run or the game might crash before you can do it. The quick inventory, at least for me, worked 100% of the times and is instant :)
---
That’s so you can see them farther away, rather than have them jump up when you get close
---
Since you are playing solo are you using Lone Wander? Because with that and Blocker (melee damage reduction perk) you should easily be able to solo the power plants without armor or bothering to kill enemies.
---
Weapon weights have been fucked since launch. 
---
AFAIK Carnivore makes meat heal a lot more, but doesn't necessarily boost the other effects like melee damage for glowing meat steak. It's pretty damn handy if your stimpaks are nerfed because of Healing Factor.
---
Can attach armor piercing ammo via the magazine customization section, not sure of its efficacy however.
---
I get where you're coming from, but I feel there's more to the picture.
---
Your first point and accessibility is just a symptom of the disease. The disease itself is the game's total reliance on RNG for loot, and our inability to customize these. For example, in The Division, say you get a nice gun, with 3 talents (perks, traits) on it. And two of those are nice, but third one is shit. You can take the gun to a recalibrating station, and reroll (and keep rerolling) that one shit talent until you get a nice one. It costs to reroll it, each time, but the pool is relatively shallow. Meaning it functions both as a resource sink AND allows you to take a mostly-good-gun, and turn it into an excellent gun. FO76 disallows this. You NEED that 1-in-50,000 godroll drop. And once you get it, you dupe it and make money off of it. Because, realistically, only 0.001% of the player base will get such a gun legitimately. That is a bad system. Pure RNG is bad. It has been proven over and over and over for literally *decades*. Duping is just people making the best of the bad situation.
---
The second point, about TSE, is very telling about Bethesda as a developer. TSE is NOT NEW! It was just as obscenely overpowered in FO4, many years ago. Bethesda knew this. Bethesda just didn't give a tiny rat's ass about it. They just ported it from FO4 into FO76, and patted themselves on the back. Which is also precisely how we ended up with Lever Action Rifle reload bug - it was added in '16 in FO4, and ported, verbatim, bug and all, into FO76 without any thought. Bottom line, the entire TSE thing could have been prevented back in FO4, or in FO76 before release. This is just Bethesda being a bad developer, nothing left to say here.
---
Point three, about duping getting so rampant that it forced them to act, I can believe. But at the same time, again, remember that all this was 100% preventable. Had they done some actual quality testing, 99% of the bugs that made it into live would have been fixed before they became public. And the game was already getting sufficient amount of hate even before duping became public knowledge, supported by video evidence proving its existence. Bethesda didn't really have much of a choice here - they were facing complete annihilation of their credibility, and would have been forced to act, regardless of duping. Especially since we already know that a lot of flak the game took was because of their inferior engine, and they already announced the same engine being used in their future games. Meaning, they HAD to fix this game, if they expected to sell anything else in this endgine in future. Duping had precious little to do with it.
---
The fourth point would be spot on, except we're back to pure RNG now, which I already pointed out is a huge design flaw. It's not workable. This was conclusively proven back in original  Bordelands days. Where devs boasted the game had 17,500,000 guns, which sounded amazing, until people realized that 17,499,001 of those guns were absolute dogshit. And the odds of getting a decent gun was roughly 1 in 17,500. Meaning the game was pretty much pointless, and had no staying power due to mathematical unlikelihood you'd EVER get a gun you need. And that game was ONLY about guns, there was no armor. This game, the same RNG that governs guns, also extends to up to 5 pieces of armor. Which makes the situation COMPLETELY untenable. I'd go as far as to say we *needed* duping to bring RNG down to reasonable levels. Without duping, there's statistically virtually no chance now to make certain builds. You would have to slaughter literally millions of legendary enemies to have an even chance of completing a build.
---
All in all, you're not wrong. But most important takeaway from this is public perception. Currently, the perception is that dupers and cheaters are allowed to run rampant. A few people got banned, but people who duped, and people who benefited from duping, got to keep their duped items. As opposed to how Blizzard did things, with Diablo 3, for example. There, everyone who exploited got their account rolled back to pre-exploit state. Meaning, if you exploited, you *at best* lost all of it, AND any legitimate progress you made since then, as punishment. If you exploited AND taught others how to do it (in-game or on social media), you got banned permanently. But if you hit the exploit once or twice, said "Oh, oh, this isn't intended!" and stopped, nothing happened to you at all. This is ultimately what the biggest blow from duping was to this game - it completely wrecked Bethesda's image as a serious game developer. They let people dupe, *for months*. Then they let people *keep the duped items*. In a game where gear isn't destroyed by use. Meaning those guns, barring a few bugs or mishaps, aren't going anywhere. People were selling TSEs, in packs, on EBay, and Bethesda did nothing. This did incredible damage to how people perceive them now. I was mostly ambivalent towards them, bordering on fanboyish. But after this shitshow, I will never buy anything even loosely associated with Bethesda until well after release, when/if its viability has been established. That's the true price of letting dupers run free. It's not contained to just this game's ecosystem. It is severe, long-term damage to the company's entire image. And this will be brought up, for many years, every time they are about to release a new product. And each time it'll cost them in sales.

I added the heavy barrel mod to the mounted 50 cal.. It lost weight. Tell me how a heavy barrel makes the weapon weigh less? 
---
Use the bear arms perk card it will reduce the weight to like 1 or 2 if perk card is lvl 3
---

Honestly IMO that location and it's doppleganger would make great work shops, the one, while controlled could give you a small squad of guardian sloths that acompany you around, and the other could give you &gt;!the ability to summon a ridable vertibot as it has a full on landing pad on that mansion!&lt; but, they should make the locations mutually exclusive, meaning if you or your team cap one, the other is uncapable.

Power Plants and Junk Yards should be the same imo tbh

I don't remember. I answered the door and this Vault Tec guy started asking me some questions from a clipboard. Then a woman called me, I turned round to look at her, and someone slugged me from behind. Then I woke up in this vault with a hangover and a party hat.

Gahdamn bruhv
---
They are mostly in The Mire due to trees, they like to hang around the treehouse villages, makes me think they may have been tamed at one point
---
So basically buff everything to one shot land?
---
I already one shot most enemies without two shot or explosives.....
---
Okay it’s a stupid idea but to be honest I don’t think the two shot nerf is silly either. Although if I were Bethesda I’d give the second shot a 100% of the first shot but give it no perks or other bonuses. Plus I’d secretly nerf the guns optional range (the most damage done before drop off) by about half to boot. E.g. the TS handmade with maxed rifle perks would do 160% for the first bullet and a 100% for the second before damage drop off. 
---
I would also change expensive perk weapons to be explosive weapons that only benefit from the explosives perk E.g. the TSE handmade with maxed rifle perks would do 200% explosives damage for the first bullet and a 100% rifle damage for the second. 
---
This is a [better version.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaoLU6zKaws)

So far im working on a second character but i have one that has her backstory finished.

Clare-A 54: a time traveling synth sent by a group of ex-enclave member known as the Unity keepers, they programed and outfited this synth with adanced power armor and a modified harpoon gun that fires a lazer like singe blast capable of decimating entire towns.
---
Clares first objective in west virgina is to find the fisure prime and extract material to use to create a particle colider, this will later be used to create a anti-matter guass rifle, this weapon will be put on liberty prime and hacked by the Unity keepers to purge the rest of the troubleling factions(the ones considered moraly evil), the leader of the Unity keeps though has different plans for this gauss rifle... darker plans.
---
Sorry for bag grammar, I dont realy do spelling checks.
---
It’s unfortunate especially for those who may spend an insane amount of caps on an item and then lose it hopefully whatever’s happening gets figured out
---
Shotguns and pistols could use it.
---
Well it’s made that way by design, and there is a risk to (try to) balance the reward. So it’s not exactly god mode.
---
30 days after this comment and I’d say it’s not boring. At least not boring that it’s powerful, it’s boring that nothing else is nearly as powerful as it is.
---
Besides, I’m not going to switch to something weaker that’ll just take more time and ammo to kill, what’s the point in that?
---
I got my first legit TSE drop today after 150hrs of game time, just in time for Bethesda to nerf them because of 1000s of them being handed out by dupers. 
---
Thanks I guess.
---
There is the mining helmet that has the really bright light, that’s helpful.  I’d consider that an effect for a piece of headgear.  
---
If you don't have any vested interest in that world, just switch servers if someone tries to claim the workshop from you and putting you in PvP. It won't follow you to the next world. 
---
I just take workshops to get the free plans if I am by them and do the first defend event. But I will jump servers if anyone wants to come hunt me out in the world for it. 
---
So basically this game needs to go back on the shelf for the next year or so, while they actually finish it.
---
Mini indeed. Maybe mini death claws soon.
---
I spaced lol you're right 
---
Nerf everything including armor and stimpacks. Hell, they should even nerf the Eyebot. I bet that thing damages low levels. They should just turn every weapon into a pillow. Then everyone can have pillow fights.
---
We can, yes. But in another thread. 
---
Have a good one fallout 76. Not spending months of time to aquire weapons and then have them become something to drop and have a broken build when respec takes another 2 weeks.  I used to defend this game but after this I'll stand in line to trash it. Good job swapping your PvP unbalance to the next highest damage meta that will also one shot and destroying the game for many pve players in the process. To fix PvP you make players hit other players for 10-20% damage and have different effects in PvP vs PvE like every other game. What you don't do is make PvE enemies into bullet sponges for everyone as you try to change the game to fortnite 76 when no one plays PvP in the first place. Hate to tell you but fallout 76 is not the next big e sports title.
---
I don’t kill foxes because they remind me of dogs. Now, feral, mutated dogs and wolves sure. Because they want to eat my face.
---
Good. Proof?
---
I've always used 3-4.
---
My bases are usually 2x3s though and lately most of my budget goes to crops and defensive walls.
---
4 turrets work great on a strategically placed camp with most paths walled off.
---
Nothing in this game makes sense which is why I just gave up. Maybe it will be good in a year. I put in about 20 hours, still waiting for it to be fun.
---
I have gotten them as drops from SBs and from Grafton Monsters.
---
I'm going SB hunting tonight, for a quest, so check with me tomorrow, I may have one to sell cheap.
---
I don't believe you. 
---
For melee to work I have to get up close, and usually with low health and minimal armor. For TSE you can be a country mile away cloaked in chameleon. That creates a balance.
---
Well I'm 28 and you draw better than I do! Great start, keep on practicing
---
Yes but melee weapons also benefit from the "Incisor" perk.
---
Boy my favorite part about playing on PC is being able to run a full melee build and a full shotgun build and hot swapping them for SBQ.
---
They call me "The Crippler"
---
...
---
and also "Butthole"
---
Because of my attitude
---
You promise?!?!?

That's for rifles only, he said shotguns specifically in his post.

---
well u could simply ask, or read my comment on another post on this same thread, but w/e ur right "selfish assholes living loud and proud" world now
---
I get what you're saying and don't disagree with you.
---
The thing is most survival games make 2 mistakes. 1)they reward people who can spend 24/7 online. I get that that is the reward for putting in the hours and it is meant to be a semi realistic version of things. But the games aren't fair to casuals (and no life isn't fair but this is recriation where we should all get to have fun not just the people who can farm top tier gear all day)
---
2)there isn't any drawback to being a dick. Sure *some* people will be raiders and some will kill on sight and the like but in the real world that carries risks. You try raid some low level scavvies and they manage to injure you. Good luck getting  your gangrene treated in your single person camp filled with rotting corpses on spikes. You will need doctors and healers which are from communities. And not everyone will be able to hunter gather. With the availability of God level equipment means people can one do everything themselves. Meaning there is no NEED for participation. Too many of these games reward griefing because people will moan if they can't. 
---
Drive fast and eat ass. Also you are what you eat. One more um...

"You know, in this game,

You gotta eat the whole ass bro

Ain't no playing around

You know what I'm saying?"

Weird I went to school for it and I program fire panels with code and it's very easy to make a mistake so nice try and they are changing more than just the damage output 
---
I’m at 80 and I notice the Nuke drop at the Prime fissure so I joined in.   I had just reloaded and repaired everything (T-60 Power Armor) so thought it was time.   
---
I was there a little late, must have been after she got her one heal in, because the health meter kept going down.  But I just kept a stream of bullets on her and each time she landed I ran up and bonked her on the nose with All Rise.  
---
I died once.   You have to pay much more attention to your health meter when going up against the queen, especially melee.  She deals a lot of damage with each hit.  Plus, you have to factor in lag.  I had lots of stims left, just couldn’t get them to register at the time that I died. 
---
I re-spawned and got back into the fight.  We ended up taking her down.
---
Just get into the fight.  If nothing else, you can help sweep the other scorch that spawns in the area of the queen, keeping them off of those shooting her or bonking her on the nose...   grin
---
It's definitely subjective. Absolutely. 
---
The ammo grind is what killed it for me personally. I do miss my sniper/vats/crit build but there is zero chance I'm going back to it if I have to keep farming ammo like we have to now. I'd much more prefer to play my old way to be honest though. Melee is good, to me, simply because I don't have to farm non stop for ammo. But I personally enjoyed sniping more then melee. 
---
Also Nerd Rage Perk if you like fighting at low HP (personally not a fan)   
---
As for how I use my other mutations, so far I'm using.  
---
Damage:
---
Talons +25% unarmed damage + bleed -4AGI (-1 with level 3 **Class Freak)**
---
Twisted Muscles +25% melee damage + cripple damage -50% gun accuracy only noticeable with vats personally (-12% with level 3 **Class Freak)**
---
Defence:
---
Electrically Charged shocks melee attackers - Self damage (self dmg is so low its almost non existant)
---
Grounded +100nrg resistance -50% damage with energy GUNS (-12% with level 3 **Class Freak)**
---
Scaley Skin +50 damage &amp; Energy Resist -50AP (-12 with level 3 **Class Freak)**
---
Mobility:
---
Marsupial +jump height (massive with strange in numbers!) + 20 carry capacity -4 INT (-1 with level 3 **Class Freak)**
---
Speed Demon 20% faster run speed and reload  - quicker food/water drain (almost no difference with level 3 **Class Freak)**
---
Other:
---
Carnivore +2x benefits from meat -cant use vegitables (havent tested with cooked food buffs yet, Works amazingly well with Cannibal perk)  
---
You can counter the -1 perk points with Herd mentality. It doesnt currently give you a negative with level 3 **Class Freak** on while solo, and will give you +2 in a team or +3 with a team member thats mutatated and the  strange in numbers perk.
---
Me, less worried about "Weapons and Armour" and more interested in Ammo, plans, mats, those are the things that I would be most interested in buying. Grinding for a for a few hours for gears, or screws or plastic is a very different experience than trying to grind for a legendary weapon. 
---
Pick up Party Boy/Girl and Professional Drinker. This way you can chug rum and beer all day. 
---
nope still creeping around looking for it
---
It's rough. Years back the subreddit for a game was still a bit separate from the main herd. Worst of the stuff was kept to forums. Subreddits these days are basically better, centralized, and more accessible than anything a game company can get going on their own site. 
---
It's nice knowing that devs likely keep as close an eye on their subreddits as they do forums, but it does suck that you can't have smaller more meaningful discussions as it getting any exposure is at the mercy of the locust swarm hive mind. Not a huge fan of soundbytes being able to move the discussion for days at a time.
---
Obviously you don't understand the point I'm making.
---
I have been in the exact same boat as you with this game, so earlier this week I started recruiting other casual players to join a "community" where we can coordinate schedules and so on. Some of us do very very light roleplay which basically is just a quick backstory to your character to explain why your build is what it is or any other quirky things you might want to do. Totally not required.
---
Many of us rerolled new characters and are below level 10, but we range up to the 20s so far. There are 7 members currently and I haven't had to play alone yet in the evenings. If you want to join us I just moved our Reddit chat to a forum so it's easier to communicate (just created this morning so it's bare bones at the moment):

I slay frogs all day for their tasty froglegs lol. I didn't shoot the cat when i saw it though....
---
Wow I didn't think it would happen but with that proof you provided......oh you didn't provide any proof 
---
The nerf is mostly coming to appease the PvP crowd. Dunno if you have tried using melee in workshops yet or not but generally you're going to die long before you reach them for a swing. Marsupial also makes it much harder to connect melee swings than it does to gunshots. And finally you have the blocker perk which nerfs melee a solid 45%, there is no equivalent gun perk
---
Although I only know of two instances that bulk significantly reduces weight, I know of 0 that increase.  Which junk gets heavier with bulking? 
---
Odd... I was getting sneak attack bonuses last night fighting the scorchbeast queen. I definitely wasn't alone either.
---
Frogs are actually good to 'farm' as they, for some reason, are full of Uranium ore half the time.
---
Foxes also drop fox meat you can cook for a decent (not great, but not bad) food item that grants an AP buff iirc
---
Yup can't break peoples entire build and then leave them no way to change it. Should atleast get a free respec with the patch. Yuh know since guns are now useless and we are basically forced to play melee. I will be quiting the game instead though.
---
The game IS boring after you hit endgame and drop some nukes and kill SBQ. Nerfing stuff sure isn't going to make it more exciting. The game needs new content ASAP because everyone just does their vendor loop and then stares at the map wondering WTF to do.
---
Everything is pretty much already there if you build for it. At least with a change like the OP mentioned, though his numbers are probably still too high, and least people are getting something back. And the two effects aren't stacking together.
---
We do that! We call it "the neighborhood" we have about 8 bases near each other in the cranberry bog. Is great for trading mats back and forth without loading screens. It's fun to hang out at each other's bases as well!
---
Lead and aluminum were the only things pre patch.
---
I hope its true
---
What I've noticed since the patch is that the game will sorta load in, I can see a not-fully-rendered view of what I will see when I load in, the camp placement happens (meaning it will warn me my camp couldn't be placed), then another regular loading screen, then I spawn in.
---
Never had an issue with being attacked during this phase, but I tend not to load into places where I'd be attacked.
---

the inventory and weight system was made by an idiot, I can find other words to describe it.
---
Having this exact same issue, the now-dead-claw’s ghost won’t leave my damn stored budget, even after moving the CAMP.
---
RIP that 10%.
---
Getting out-of-normal-band gear early and making it more accessible didn't somehow help the game. If anything, it funneled everyone into TSE "builds" (which is laughable considering anything works with TSE). Since this was out of normal band you have plenty of players who skipped mechanics introduced in the game entirely to lawnmower down the queen with an unbalanced dynamic.
---
Bethesda isn't under any pressure to do anything other than continue releasing content they already had planned to release. The more player retention they have leads to more reasons to invest in the game. The "community hate" you see is the average Reddit/YouTube hate bubbles of players reacting to reactions of players. There are more than likely plenty of players that have no idea what a TSE is and can't wait until a CAMP DLC shows up.
---
Dupes did nothing more or less than they usually do in online games: create a player entitlement to have what they want immediately for fear of missing out. Do you know I've heard a player ask if Disease Cures could be duped because they thought they were rare? O.o
---
The equipment is already stale. If you haven't burned yourself out on TSE and shifted to at least Bloodied..... You're far behind the curve.

Found the plan some days ago in that big treehouse in the mire.

Rapid fire on the double barrel shotgun will wreck anything if you aim it right. Reload perks make it quite fun
---
I use to but it takes up too much budget. I wish I had them. It’d be nice if they downed the budget cost on them. 
---
Yeah, as a software developer in real life I understand things like database limitations. It's why the stash limit started out at 400 and only increased to 600 as a test. They need to see how it performs with higher limits. 
---
And I agree, just putting some extra pixels on the bookshelves wouldn't hurt performance at all.
---
Wish we could tame them to use them as a mobile minicamp, after all, you can see duffel bags and shit hanging out the dirty 'shell' front, and I bet the big fellers would adore having their shells cleaned propper and made pretty.  Can also post later as I got a pic right beside a glowin' hermit crab while doin' a thumbs up
---
Might be easier said than done.  I think all of the local object loading relies on your character being in the world.
---
Awesome Opposum Bacon is a good food item, gives +2 luck iirc
---
Hardened isn't the same as a refined/critical receiver.
---
As they're isn't a hardened .50 reciever it does do less damage than a hardened .308 reciever.
---
Go clear a super mutant camp with a regular rifle and then get back to me. Everything is a bullet sponge and TS was the only thing that made not chugging stimpaks possible.
---
I'm planning to remove the turrets , the basic low level ones, most of the time they do not shoot back at enemies.
---
Same
---
It really depends how much you play. I've logged into a nuke and died in Morgantown and in Lewisville in the past week alone. Currently (as of last patch) there's also the issue where loading screen is split into two stages. First it loads, then shows you where you are spawning, but you cannot move yet. You are in-game at this point though, taking damage from any normal source. Then after a few seconds it gives you another loading screen, loads for a bit, and finally lets you into the game properly. Trouble is, in nuke zone, you die long before it lets you have control. 
---
Bottom line - logging people into an active nuke zone is asinine. It is doubly-asinine, when it logs you into an active nuke zone because you got disconnected from the server, due to no fault of your own. And you happened to be overencumbered. And nearest spawn is now FO76. And you died somewhere in Watoga. Not good.
---
Mostly no, but if I aim at you while you're invisible AND shoot and hit you it will show. If I move my aim away it's gone again. There's also a mod on PA, I think the helmet, that provides a compass pip of you after you engage the PA wearing player.

There are 3 power armor spawns in Watoga very near each other ( of which do not require jumping or elevators) you can just server hop and fill up to your heart's content. Or you can craft them, use superduper and go for double the goods!!
---
Please look at miniguns too please. A shredding minigun lasts minutes while a supersledge can swing for hours.
---
You’re wrong. 
---
Thanks Wilso! Appreciate the info. I was almost certain that it wouldn't but hadn't gotten to test it myself yet.
---
I did the other day after being wrongfully banned, you know how fucking terrible it is after leveling 3 characters with no more high exp glowing ones?
---
What proof do you need? The email sent to those who got banned? 
---
Scrap junk before you put it in your stash, keep duplicates of weps to scrap for mods, and don't be toxic to high levels.
---
What about your own turrets detecting you. Does that mess up sneak attack? I noticed that at workshops etc. but never had a chance to pay attention to it or test it.
---
Maybe make a Distress Beacon meets Hunter/Hunted Radio type alert? Anyone who gets the busted holotape can tune in and be directed to a single location to meet up and run the event? I don't know, just a thought. (I struggle to make friends in game and all my meatspace friends are power levelers who are bored already while I meticulously explore every inch if the map and quest line I can.)
---
game seems pretty much over once you can just pick that stuff from a loop, the gameplay is already so thin, what is even left to play for once you can just buy out the plans/items/weapons you want and never be at risk for ever having any wants or needs except some low enough amount of caps to buy things from a sea of people feeding in basic items. 
---
I’m diggin it!

I just encountered 2 Megasloth corpses....that got merced by a Scorchbeast. Easiest loot of my life without the guilt!

Why are you running PA and armor?

If you focused on one and spent 3 measily perks your repair costs would be nothing. Or you can run the battery perk to greatly increase your fusion core times.

I enjoyed this
---
Next melee will be nerfed back in line and all will be well under the Atom’s holy rays
---
I can believe this. Bethesda actually have s statement in the last Inside the Vault about this. 
---
Hope so. 
---
I think hes waiting on a Bethesda employee to walk him to an NPC and click trade for him.
---
I think they did it because the reward to risk ratio on TSE was too high. The closest prefix that is compared to TS is bloodied. However, that instead requires you to play sub 20% HP with adrenal reaction and nerd rage. In this build you can get one shot but mostly anything, but will be alright as long as you don't get caught. On the other hand TSE always you to be full hp and dish out more dmg.
---
They all have nuclear waste in them and are based off a real drink called Radithor. The divergent time line sticks with the mindset of the 50s with pretty much no governmet restrictions. 
---
Avoid pvp everyone gets 1-shot these days

Infinite loading screen at posiden energy everytime.

Lol!

That's the understatement of the year.

White Knight is essential.

I honestly thought that was going to be the plan. A big factor of baseball card collecting is trading with friends. I thought for sure they would let us trade with other players.

And yet...here you are!

So if you do Cannibal, AND Bloody Mess, do you drink them with a straw?

Now if only a way to get rid of the industrial water purifier that is taking up space in the stored items tab could be found...
---
Yup I'm done with the game after this. A shotgun should not take 14 shells to kill one enemy 2 stimpaks if you pull 3. Gave it every chance I could but I'm not going back to bullet sponges and having every weapon I farmed for months for be drop worthy.
---
I can do alot more damage with my half set up melee build than i can with my tse shotty nearly maxed, the legendary effects dont need nerfing, its possible that the demolition expert perk card needs to be nerfed when effecting legendary effects (it makes my 1100 damage shotty do 1700 damage when the perk is maxed) 
---
Remember that [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/) is a thing if you want some positivity when you ask new player questions!
---
This still feels like clickbait even after reading what you’re saying. 
---
You’ve either got to do a top tier melee vs top tier stealth sniper vs top tier rifleman tank comparison. 
---
You gloss over the actual fight mechanics of these encounters, such as flight time vs grounded time in scorchbeasts. 
---
Not trying to bash on OP specifically, but i play a stealth sniper and am fine with melee the way it is. I never get hit, so my armor almost never needs repairing. Im sure the melee folks have to repair as part of armor maintenance. 
---
I can imagine all builds having end game viability so long as you understand that the costs of gearing, costs of maintenance, and applicability in specific scenarios are different. 
---
I could see this as something similar to Guild Wars 2's WvW mode where you are on a team , and the goal is to capture different points for different benefits. That promotes teamwork, involves PvP, and could include rebuilding the areas. Someone else mentioned something about being able to nuke certain areas before you are able to claim them for your faction which could work well too.
---
Say 500 caps? I'm also looking for an assaultron circuit board so I'd be willing to trade for that too
---
I think the tse nerf outcry is 100 fold because of duping.

If they were as rare as they should be ppl would be happy the small amount of ppl using them would be brought in line.

Explosive weapons: know your target, what lies beyond , and anything near your target INCLUDING yourself.

When you're *really* finessing a placement, there's a movement trick that isn't exactly obvious. When you have the item selected and can move it around on the x-y axis, press and *hold* the Activate button (E on pc, whatever is the "use" button on console). Now y

20+1=26 come on this is basic math 
---
Lol. I once accidentally dropped a treasure map and it vanished instead of being in a paper bag. I spent ages looking for it afterwards. Unfortunately never found it, and it was a week later that I finally got another one.
---
another terrible change IMHO 
---
Absolutely right,
---
This is a survival game and where as I do not wish to die all the time or have my camp demolished day in and day out.  I feel taking that side of the game away may make it less fun to play.  I carefully move through the woods and stay clear of the roads if I see another player I approach them with caution making sure to be ready, just in case, these are things I would do in a RL apocalypse.
---
They made a big mistake not overhauling their weapons and ammo types for 76.  If I ever have to make a choice between two weapons that use the same ammo, and one burns it at a 5x rate to do the same damage, it's a no-brainer.
---
They sorta did it right with .50 and 5mm being crafted in large amounts, but .50 crossing over with hunting rifles kinda screwed things up.  Similarly with 10mm, I'd rather use a pistol that does much more damage and still has a very high fire rate.  Don't get me started on .308 and the LMG, that's just the worst.
---
This is easily making its way into my top 5 favorite CAMPs, great job!
---
Recently moved my place into the cranberry bog, and I still don't bother with turrets. 
---
I tend to place mine in spots I don't think other players will come near regularly, so the only time enemies spawn near my base is when I actually go there. At that point I can just kill them myself (the turrets rarely do that anyway, back when I used to use them).
---
I can check later. Remind me if you still need it and I don't get back to you.
---
I think I have it but I can't remember if I gave it away already.
---
Very true, I tried it once and never looked back
---
&gt; You can't melee a flying scorchbeast. 
---
You're not wrong. But go and count how many enemies fly in this game that you can't reach as melee by jumping up and hitting them (like you can most turrets, especially with Marsupial). Did you need more than the fingers on one hand to count them? Probably not, right? Now count all the enemies in the game that you can melee at any time. Did you run out of fingers, toes and penises to count them? Very likely, right?
---
THAT'S why melee vs ranged needs to be looked at. There's literally a handful of situations where melee is suboptimal. And once you factor in ammo procurement and weapon maintenance, even time-wise melee still likely comes out ahead.
---
I don't have a problem with their numbers. I have a problem with you cherry picking numbers that don't apply to our conversation. You are taking irrelevant data and applying it so that you appear technically correct. Saying that an adult doesn't sleep enough on average because you include numbers where infants sleep 17 hours per day is fucking stupid.
---
Yes.
---
That's ok. I was planning to sell them for a cap per five rounds. Or if you have any plans I haven't found yet 8d be willing to trade for the lot depending on what it is
---
Refund it. 
---
Yup they are trying to change a pve game to be fortnite 76. In the process destroying pve for the entire player base. Iv gave this game all the chance I could but I'm not wasting anymore time just to have that time be made so bad I might as well drop it. Go to hell Bethesda.
---
So update: I've updated my drivers, tinkered with some settings...and yeah still got the Vats flicker. Looking down or away helps most of the time. But killing the offending mobs fixes it 100%

*hears jack hammer noises*

I can't, your teeth are in the way!
---
Any idea how much budget each laser turret uses?
---
I'll settle for mods that do what they say they do
---
This must have been with the 5g update with the new patch....
---
Hopping whitesprings has its risks.
---
Live and learn. It's just junk
---
&gt; melee builds that do over 1300 damage per swing  
---
Without a doubt this is a low-life build with a Bloodied weapon, Adrenal Reaction and Unyielding gear. You can achieve much the same level of damage using a ranged weapon and a low life build.
---
Note that this player won't have especially good defenses. As you mentioned you can kill them in ~2 hits from range.
---
Melee isn't inherently the issue here, although the [lack of ranged damage scaling with any SPECIAL](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/adldhi/special_and_perks_rebalance_proposition_aka_dream/) stat does need some attention.
---
The funny thing is it was already nerfed in PvP with Fireproof perk. But that doesn't just apply to TSE but to all explosives, so all explosive weapons in PvP were nerfed because of that one weapon legendary effect and peoples enjoyment complaining about it.
---
I have tomorrow off, so I will attempt to finish it and post pics. 
---
Heck yes. Time to get as many wooden chameleon legs as I can carry before the good times end.
---
I thought it was eat ass smoke grass and sled fast
---
haha, that too - of course! That alone would be a huge improvement. ;)
---
Have you tried scraping it?  
---
If we can’t trade between players I would at least accept an internal trade mechanic. Even turn in 2 I don’t want to get 1 of my choice would be acceptable. Something better than this.
---
To be entirely honest, the Fallout 4 level mechanic was awesome. You could see everything up front to plan your character. It was great. This, though, this is bad.
---
See a locked terminal? Pause to swap cards
---
About to eat canned dog food? Pause to swap cards
---
About to craft? Pause to swap cards

This system completely breaks down the realism of the game. Suddenly, I forgot how to wander alone but am now a super bargainer!
---
Silver lining, Fallout 76 is a fantastic menu navigation simulator.
---
I think it's like cats and scratching posts - mole rats need the aluminum used in workstation construction to file down their teeth.
---
Range vs having to get in melee range is definitely the same thing. I can definitely sit on top of Whitesprings and 1 shot snipe people w my Axe. I can definitely snipe hoards of mobs in a nuke zone from far away w my axe before fun users can run close so shoot them. OH WAIT THATS RANGED USERS DOING THAT TO MELEE CLASSES YOU NITWIT. 
---
What the fuck is up w people like you always asking to nerf everything? Every single game NERF NERF NERF.
---
People like  you will never be happy until everything single thing does 1 damage.
---
GO AWAY. Fucking crybabies. 
---
If they are nerfing these weapons to the extent that they are, they need to fix the inherent bullet sponginess of most of the end game enemies. How about making it so that the SB Queen doesn’t level with whoever spawns it in and the amount of people there? I can’t tel you how many times I’ve had groups of 20 people emptying thousands of two shot explosive ammo into that thing only to get it down half way through it’s first life at the end of the 30 minutes. On top of the fact that the loot isn’t even kind of worth it
---
Isn't that what Destiny did long ago
---
I'd be glad to! I'm on PC

Thanks bruhv. I will. What is your username
---
Nice bethesda bot, pretty bad you're wrong though. The game is trash and a shame to Bethesda's legacy. People like you is why greedy companies exist. Stop playing games.
---
We usually take her down in a team of 4 in just a few mins 
---
Yup destroying pve in their goal of making fortnite 76. Are they trying to run people off on purpose? Anyone who likes this hasn't used a regular weapon recently. This is absolutely sickening for the people that legitimately grinded for these weapons so they wouldn't support the dupers.
---
How can you have both? Herbivore prevents you from gaining hunger back by eating meat. Carnivore prevents you from gaining hunger back when eating plants. 
---
If you had both you could eat...nothing?
---
At most I’ll use a single middle launcher turret as I’ve noticed that most (if not all) of the enemies attacking my camp originate from one direction. To be honest though repairing destroyed structures when it happens gives me something to do with my surplus materials.
---
Other crap. I think i got the windmill on my 2nd try that was non perfect start. But its a windmill... 0.o
---
Who cares about the lore now.. We already established the story suckkkkssss give us more big stuff to shoot 😂
---
I found a tse 44 and it didn't take long for me to realize that its obscenely OP... It literally trivializes everything but the queen fight. 
---
You can't hate devs for trying to balance their game. If you wanna feel like you're playing with god mode then go play a single player game with cheats on... 
---
and PISTOLS please &lt;3
---
Hit it with a VOX syringer and listen to it talk shit. You won't feel bad anymore.
---
Some people collected thousands of .308 while leveling and it took them a while to realize that replacing it would be impractical after they burned through it with an LMG.
---
No we can't talk about it, You can shoot a melee person with a gun. If you struggle to do that, that's a you problem and you are just trash at the game. Case closed. Case dismissed. All these cry babies lately, geesh.
---
Innocents are also getting caught. It's not be human doing the bans it's  synth 
---
Hahha yeah getting rid of extra wood feels good.
---
Just trying to find somewhere safe to do my favorite thing pre war. Eating ass. 
---
Absolutely, an in-game hub with human NPC's for quest and vending. While still following the 76 storyline it's not a stretch to imagine some of the original Vault 76 members to come back and set up a make-shit town inside
---
Don't read any of the other responses to this post, close Reddit, get off YouTube.
---
Start the game and start playing. Listen to all the audio tapes, read all the notes, learn everything for yourself.
---
Yeah, it gives an error and can't be scrapped. Known bug; I'm not the only one afflicted.
---
There simply is not, This isn't even up for debate. 
---
I just want to know what my mods are for, I got one just called "bladed"
---
Not saying these were the best changes just looking at it from bethesda's perspective. Fireproof was meant to be a buff to the perk not a nerf to weapons since who actually cared about fire resistance. That one was likely more of a PvE focused balance change. 
---
Here's the thing about melee versus explosive shots.
---
Melee swings at 1k+ typically require you to be heavily specialized into that, or you're running at 20% hp and die from being sneezed on. In addition, your "range" is pretty much as far as you can VATS lunge, which isn't that far.
---
It's a symptom of the PVP needing an entire rework, rather than melee being "super strong"; my TSE harpoon will do literally 6-7x the damage, at range, without having to change significantly (maybe one or two perk cards out of unarmed) and that's why it's being nerfed.
---
.50 cal should be a one-shot stop.
---
Fallout is still exactly what Fallout always was. If that's not good enough for you, then that's your fault for romanticizing it in the first place.
---
Wouldn't it be nice if the Fusion Generator's connector didn't stick up   
---
making it more than one building unit high?  
---
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
---
In the kind of world where we belong?
---
No, I know, the windmill sucks. I just want to see if you are actually getting generators of any sort. That really sucks. 
---
It's true friend was making ammo for crew with all the perks an produced 100k ammo with supperdupper an other ammo doubler so he mad ammo about 5 min an they ban him for account for Mass production assuming a dupe an deff not the case he lost both computer an console version so just know all the witch hunting is now getting non dupers out of the game so when all the whiners are getting game looked at an you get banned though no falt of your own don't say a word just remember you got your 70.00 worth of play oh an with low carry an storage don't have a mule banning offince too
---
* You can fast travel to Vault 76 for free at any time, so feel free to build a CAMP farther away from it.
---
* Consider using a stats builder like this one from [nukesdragons.com](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111111&amp;d=&amp;w=&amp;n=) . I did not initially invest in Charisma and Luck, I am wondering if I should have to get better enemy drops.
---
* Use the Overseer's CAMP early on to be able to craft things and for storage. Personally I wouldn't really build a camp until you reach the middle of the map, but up to you.
---
* Stash boxes appear at almost every Red Rocket and Train station, so use these as landmarks for storing stuff, possibly meeting players.
---
* When you reach level 15, be on the lookout for Handmade Rifle plans as these seem to have a level cap, unless you want to try Patrol Duty. I'm not aware of other plans with these restrictions.
---
* Feel free to participate in events with higher-level players, and be of help. example: Uranium Fever, if it's just two of you, get hits on the mole miners and fix the reactors as needed.
---
Most important, have fun and play at your own pace!
---
I'm guessing your melee and haven't tried to do anything with a regular gun recently. Everything takes 10 plus rounds and that's with a fully moded gun. Have a good one fallout 76 I'm not having my time be flushed down the toilet again for PvP that will still be broken and that no one plays anyways. Go to hell Bethesda.
---
Your comment taught me the word shill, thank you! 
---
the people have a point when they say some things need a nerf, but I feel like they miss *what* needs the nerf
---
There shouldn't really be much opportunity to one shot people, melee or ranged. It's kinda fucked the way the system currently gives the W to whoever attacks second, really, regardless of how they play.
---
We did too after having a very crash free day
---
Maybe even quack surgeon? Reviving people with alcohol. hah
---
OMG yes. I had a couple hundred 40mikemike built up so decided to go on a grenade rampage when someone nuked White Springs. The Tennis Court/Clubhouse glowing ghoul slaughter was glorious! I sat outside the door and when they bunched up to get out I just lobbed as many 40's as I could in one rack into the lobby. 
---
Some tips I discovered along the way ...
---
When you collect a plan or recipe, you have to go into notes tab of your inventory to use the plan as a consumable to “learn”. Otherwise, you’ll be carrying pounds of these unlearned plans and recipes and wonder why you can’t make anything. I got caught on that.
---
Bobble heads and magazines only grant temp boosts. Read descriptions carefully before using them so as not to waste.
---
Breaking down weapons is a good way to discover modifications, so break down any and all weapons you don’t plan to use in battle.
---
There you go using logic again
---
Yes the voice of reason that says a 90% WR .50 Cal should weigh a lot less than a 90% WR Handmade because you're gonna need to slap a lot more dinky mods on the Handmade.
---
I’m in US and haven’t had more than 20min session since the latest patch
---
Good point - though maybe they could do something like after your character loads put you into another “final loading screen” so that you can have your local CAMP and objects loaded. I’ve gotten stuck inside geometry because I started moving before everything was loaded up properly. 
---
This deserves 1,000 upvotes to be honest.
---
do it ore die

How does it feel? Bethesda taking a shit on you. Reskinning fallout 4 to a new game, charging you 60 dollars for it, unbalanced, ugly, a mess of a glitchfest. How does it feel being a cuck for a company? How do you feel when you defend a lost cause? Fallout 76 is trash and an insult to you and everyone else. 
---
Good. Power Armor doesn't have enough of a downside. It needs to gimp movement speed or something else.
---
This happens with many different types of objects when you place one object on top of another and then store the one on bottom.  Funny thing is, I noticed that if the object on bottom gets destroyed that the object on top disappears.  If you then repair the destroyed object, both objects reappear.  
---
I doubt they will, but that's not even the issue. The issue now is, what *else* are they going to nerf? I mean, OK, arguably TSEs needed it. I'm not even going to argue. Explosive and Bleeding shootguns were obscene as far back as FO4 at least. But now that TSEs are getting the axe, what's next? Are they going to decide low-HP builds are doing too much damage? What's next? That's what worries me the most.
---
Imagine spending a shitlioad of time and effort to properly build a low-HP character, and Bethesda says "So, I noticed you're having fun in this game. I'm sorry Dave, I can't allow that." and just nerfs the everloving shit out of it. 
---
Having a mule isn't against any rules 
---
BAM! Guns need a BUFF melees doesn't need a nerf in PVE. 
---
Although now that I'm melee I can't do shit against SBQ till she lands. (I can I kept my rifle perks but you know what I mean) But yes, when she does land melee is king in PVE. Although she bites my  my face non stop while gun users are using my body as a shield taking no damage so that's a plus for gun users. 
---
What the fuck do these people want? Guns that do a billion more damage then melee from range where they can be safe and not take damage? GTFO w this bullshit already.
---
Trade off. Every game ever and every class ever has them. 
---
&gt; Shotgun perks are related to Strength
---
Which doesn't make any sense. Melee yes, heavy weapons yes. Shotguns being long guns should scale with the same stat as rifles.
---
No the hell it isn’t. Fruit bonnets?  Clown outfits ? Microtransactions? I played Fallout when it was GURPS. I saw the fallout movie when it was called A Boy and his Dog.  It’s a total joke what Bethesda and Zenimax have done to this franchise. 
---
I think i might have an assaultron circuit board, but 500 sounds fair. I'll probably be on alittle later today, ill send you my psn in dm.
---
It's an error in how the AI inheritance is handled, they are defaulting to cowardly 
---
Trying to build a base and have been disconnected 3 times, forcing me to start from scratch again. I think I’m gonna give this game a break until the fix their shit 
---
Yup TS is the only thing that makes solo play not be 15 hunting rifle shots to kill a single mob. I could see nerfing explosive but leave the damn TS alone. My guns do not say "fires and additional rubber projectile". Have a good one Bethesda it's been a shitty waste of time.
---
I play as judge dread character and yell all my lines in the mic  whenever I switch to different guns/ammo. Is pretty fun I just cant seem to find a good helmet that covers just the top bbn part of my face
---
&gt;plastic
---
especially if you plan on using shotguns!
---
I don't even want to think about what that tasted like.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WjWGNTadalTRvtG1MzzFqGVQ3YOWv5QgnurmNyudPZM/edit#gid=0
---
Now be quite thanks. 
---
What? Mods all weigh about 1 lb, guns get heavier as you mod them. This has been the case since Fallout 4.
---
I had just got my Dense chest mod on my Heavy Combat Armor and was tanking Scorchbeast blasts like they were nothing. Then they announced the Fireproof perk and I was like wow those TSE aren't gonna be such a big deal. And then the announcement of the heaviest nerf to both two shot and explosive legendary effect damage. Those weapons have now been nerfed well into the ground.
---
sounds good. I'll be in class till late but I'll message you on psn when I get home. Pleasure doing business with you
---
Well that was...different. 
---
I Believe in you.
---
Every “patch” just seems to get worse I think I liked it more in 1.0 version lol
---
I was able to scrap mine recently, I thought they might have fixed it.
---
It adds up over a large stack, but more importantly its sellable.  I'm fine with only a marginal decrease in weight, but perplexed that any bulk junk actually weighs more then single.  I suppose unless there's a change I will sell off my bulk steel and wood and keep them raw and drop the surplus.
---
The Motherlode!
---
Plus, it's a  CAMP resource hog. Probably be better to use at a workshop if you plan to build a lot.
---
Everyone hates dupers... There isn't much content.. Most people are riding round on an invisible high horse.. The economy is destroyed... The game is so bugged it needs an exterminator... There about to nerf the last good part of the game and have already nerfed the other good bits... My advice 
---
Return it and play Minecraft 
---
Even better if the unique cryolator forced Scorchbeasts to land immediately and disabled their sonic attack...
---
The franchise was never that great to begin with.
---
I am going to need to know where I can find this spawn point...immeowdiately.
---
You're a sad little person. 
---
Doesn't that just place it at the first available spot? I played around for several **hours** trying to get everything aligned
---
Now be quiet thanks. 
---
Short answer - power creep.
---
Long answer: Buffing everything in line with overperforming equipment will make the game's difficulty trivial, and exhaust content at a much higher rate. 
---
Your problem isn't actually with the explosive weapons, your problem is with the shit re-spec system this game has, coupled with complete reliance on RNG for drops, with no player control over it. Those are the real problems that need addressing. 
---
haha you're welcome! :)
---
I agree I just don’t even use them cause like 8 is half budget lol
---
I feel that idea, I'd just rather that be implemented in the form of a robot vendor at your camp, and the ability to flag your camp on map as a trading post.
---
Cool thanks. I love the building aspect of this game.
---
Right. Everyone who likes it are all delusional and YOU are the judge jury and executioner of what it is and isn’t. Understood. 
---
Yup apparently they want gun builds to be unplayable and a basic super mutant to take 10 plus shots. PvP will still be a one shot game. You fix PvP by making player to player damage at 10-20% across the board not by ruining pve for everyone. No one plays pvp in the first place for Christ sake. Go to hell Bethesda.
---
Not much to say, find a tree that is rather straight, with a diameter equivalent to a 2x2 floor tile, place floor all around, in a square shape. (8 2x2 floor tiles)
---
So you have this pattern, `F` is floor, `T` is tree, `S` is stairs:
---
`[F][F][F]`
---
`[F](T)[F]`
---
`[S][F][F]`
---
Put stairs, do the same on the second floor. Do a third floor if you like.
---
For the fences, what I do is mix 2x2 with 2x1 and 1x1 tiles, because then you can switch between two types of fences, the long edges accept type A, short edges accept type B, mix and match so it looks more natural. You could also use walls/half walls.
---
Then you can use the steel beams (under the "Stairs" tab) to make it look supported, looks more natural too, just put them wherever it looks good.
---
Not much else to say, if you have specific question I'll gladly answer them.
---
$60 doesn't matter that much to me. Honestly, neither does any one video game. So really, doesn't feel that bad.
---
Guess I am in a different place in the game. I've been playing since BETA, but I just reached 60 last night. I sort of meander about, I follow this or that event. I've sort of played it as if I just popped out of the vault and need to rediscover the world we live in. I have a group of folks I meet with and do some quests with, but I would say 80% of my game play is solo. So, having an excuse to visit a random person's junk stock and trade with them, is an excuse to visit another part of the map that hasn't had a giant quest diamond next to it. So, instead of grinding abandon houses wear I know I can get plastic plates from, I can walk through the forest, picking up logs and soot flowers to visit a friendly vendor. 
---
&gt; Two shot and explosive are now both prefix modifiers. This means they can’t be stacked and you can have one or the other.  
---
That's fine and a viable solution. It would be interesting to see what would happen to the existing TSE weapons - would they become two-shot with no suffix or get a new suffix?   
---
&gt; Two shot does +100% damage. Explosive does +75% damage with AOE.  
---
They are both still too strong. The next best unconditional damage prefix is anti-armor at +28.9% damage. To avoid all other prefixes being considered trash-tier they need to be at least similar or situational.  
---
&gt; Rifle damage is increased 5% for every point in perception Pistol damage is increased 5% for every point in agility Energy weapon damage is increased 5% for every point in intelligence Shotgun damage is increased 5% for every point in perception. 
---
Separate issue but yes ranged weapons need to scale from SPECIAL stats not only for balance but for gear progression to matter. I made a [detailed post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/adldhi/special_and_perks_rebalance_proposition_aka_dream/).
---
Yeah pretty sure I’ve maxed out perk cards (lvl150) but still says zero
---
Wow, I'm flattered, thanks so much
---
No, not exactly. I'd say somewhere between 10-15%. I had a third one, but ended up scrapping it for more budget. 
---
People like a lot of stupid shit.
---
Live fast, eat ass
---
Creepy yet appropriate.
---
I think rework is the better word for what this games needs. 
---
Or complete over haul. 
---
In my case he was fighting a group of super mutants so he blended right in. I didn't realize until I already threw a grenade at his feet
---
try using the E button
---
I think the best way to buff them isn't to just amp up the damage, but rather to give their receivers a base armor piercing value, as the thing that kills them in this game is armor.
---
If they had a \~40% armor mitigation as default they would be much more effective, and especially when stacking further armor piercing you could get them doing a decent amount of damage.
---
Oh yes, let it all flow. Pathetic consumers. People like you is what makes bethesda downgrading each game every year. Because of sad little beings like you that defend a bad cash-grab. You are the shame of the consumer, blindly throwing your defensive stance for the sake of sponsors and morons like Todd Howard.
---
Is it though? Shouldn’t you be able to kill a human based enemy in one shot if you shoot it in the skull?
---
I also stopped playing for the same reason but of course steam and origin had winter sales so I've occupied my time since then playing new games.
---
But my partner and myself stopped by my best friends for a chat and shes playing right now and her new armor is badass and now I have serious FOMO so I know what I'm doing later.
---
I died maybe 3 times before level 30 and only die if I can't use my load of stimpaks, so I'd agree the game's a bit easy more so for higher leveled players.
---
I have over 2k Steel....  I tend to drop 1k a week and still seem flush with it :(.
---
What system are you on? Can you make replacements?
---
They will see how few players they have left when they destroy pve for a PvP mode that no one plays anyways and will still be a completely broken one shot fest.
---
&gt; once I put it on, I could never exit and was trapped in my suit, unable to craft.
---
Since it did not register you as in PA, you should have tried to see if you could put on another PA and stack the benefits.
---
and they launch you to the moon and back
---
ONLY 40 radaway? That's not nearly enough if you're heading into nuke zones, man...
---
Nope, he does not. I've seen him with the wire head piece and the propane tank
---
Welcome to the wasteland.
---
One thing i said wrong was that it weighs more. It just weighs the sameexcept lead and aluminium. 
---
And here I was, thinking I had really enjoyed the 120+ hours I've played FO76. Thank you for opening my eyes and helping me see the light. 
---
I'm on PS4. I can barely make 1 armpiece.
---
I got a few hundred caps to spend, not gonna have any plans for you though. Only got the basic stuff myself.
---
Funny thing is, he had a whole suit himself
---
Always need more plastic lol
---
No one can "steal" your equipment in this game..
---
Enjoy your yearly downgraded bethesda games boys. You all deserve no better anyway. Make them greedy companies rich. Yeeees! give them all your money. Dont forget to come up with the excuse 'I dont mind the money I give'. Take pride in something broken and shit like F76 which is at best a game from 2003. How much I enjoy seeing this game going to shit. You cannot imagine. 
---
You obviously are melee or haven't used a regular gun on anything recently. Without TS it take 10 rounds minimum to kill a super mutant. They are breaking pve to still have a one shot fest broken PvP that no one plays in the first place.
---
How did they steal them?
---
Hmmm... maybe they did. I haven't checked since the latest patch went in. I'll have to check this weekend.
---
Damn a real bit of advice&lt;3 take your upvote
---
I am satisfied with my purchase, but now that I know that upsets you it's like a nice little bonus.
---
I think its best to compare them to other legendary effects. Explosive I do believe is the only effect in its slot which gives any sort of damage increase what so ever on top of its original intention to give guns an AoE. Two shot now is a 25% buff so the closest comparison would be mutant's. Mutants gives 20% more damage with the easy trade off that you need to be mutated. Two shot gives 25% more damage with the trade off of lower accuracy, on some guns this is a huge deal but for a lot of them your accuracy aimed is still going to be high enough that the shot will still go where you aimed it. It says a lot when these effects got ultra nerfed into the ground and are still more than viable depending on your weapon choices
---
Haha I saw that Responder corpse the other day. Definitely curious how she died...
---
I picked up a legendary missile launcher the other day I promptly vendor'ed because it weighed 48 fucking pounds.  Had to be the heaviest weapon I've seen to date.
---
I just want sites on my 10mm smg.
---
Do you use Martial Artist perk too, for "600" RoF? (It's not 600.)
---
However, I've found that if I can time it *just* right, I can actually shoot faster by tap firing than auto firing. "Tap" is a bit of a misnomer because it is really arthritis-inducing spasm firing, but, it's possible.
---
Bastards. Fix bobble head/magazine stacking before fucking all the default stuff up first! 
---
You made me chuckle out loud on the crapper at work with a coworker in the stall next to me.
---
people would just server hop endlessly to check the markets on each server
---
I did it in a suit of PA. Mine didnt even register that I completed the quest.
---
Also, I'd like to see a recipe or some kind of Wasteland taco. That's all I got.
---
My name is Lincoln
---
I had forgotten how bright the sun was, (stepping from the door of the vault into the bright W. Virginia sunshine for the first time in 25 years).  I had no idea that being selected as part of the security detail for high ranking government officials was going to include being locked in a vault. (Though honestly as an afterthought, it wasn't terrible either.)
---
It all begins as I turned eighteen and enlisted in the Army, selecting special operations training as my MOS and knowing full well that if I wasn't successful in completing training it would be the life of a leg Infantry soldier for me.  I studied hard all through "A" school and graduated within the top five of my class and found a special talent in sniper operations. About three years later on a Sunday afternoon, I had been listening to some smooth Jazz, relaxing, when my Squad Ldr came in with instructions to report to the orderly room to meet with the CO, a few minutes later I was standing at his desk, sharply at attention, reporting with a brisk hand salute, ignoring the small gathering of suits in his office.  Thirty minutes after that I had orders in hand to relocate to West Virginia and report to the Cdr of Security for the office of Nuclear Advancement.
---
Tensions were already tight and it was only a few months before we entered Vault 76, given a block of quarters in the deepest levels we survived the holocaust above.  During off duty hours I studied a series of books titled "Fire Fox" and learned many skills of old appalachians,.  Scraping together what I could in the vault I practiced and honed what skills I could to pass the time but in the back of my mind, I wanted to be ready for this day, the day we came back to ground, the day we stepped back into the bright West Virginia sunshine.
---
I tried to keep this as close to lore as possible, let me know what you think.
---
No, you're not. You're just reacting :* 
---
LMFAO, that's one hell of a hunting rifle!
---
Upset about the upcoming nerf I see 
---
Yup neft explosive all you want but leave the TS that makes the game playable alone. Without it your putting 10 plus rounds with a semi auto rifle into everything. I'm done with this game if this goes live.
---
Damn, I was gonna hook you up if on xbox
---
Well, I just crafted it, got distracted by mutants and while I was gone, he must have used the station my PA was on. Either that, or my 2 armpieces somehow turned into a full set of raider PA
---
No. It’s called “a joke”. I play the game every day and don’t GAF about the nerf. You think you’re psychic I see. 
---
Technically it’s possible that though the mod itself is only 1 lb. it requires 5lbs. of “mounting brackets” or what have you.
---
(That’s the lore reasoning my guess is the real reason is for balance issues. Overpowered gun = less carrying capacity)
---
I have a vampire explosive level 10 10mm smg I use as a healing item on leveling characters.
---
More damage would make it an actual weapon which is nice.
---
Yup nerf explosive but leave TS alone it's the only thing that makes a gun build playable.
---
Looks like the cat peed in your cereal again today
---
Found the Diehard
---
You have anger in you child. 
---
Fun fact this is how animals eat.  They go in that way to get to the organs.
---
I feel bad for you, but this made me laugh.
---
"Rifle damage is increased 5% for every point in perception Pistol damage  is increased 5% for every point in agility Energy weapon damage is  increased 5% for every point in intelligence Shotgun damage is increased  5% for every point in perception."
---
This would be too op pared with vat crits. Maybe 2 or 3% to make up for having a ranged advantage over melee. Other then that, sounds good to me.

He frolicked in the autumn mist

And killed everyone he'd see!
---
They can't do that on consoles because Sony and Microsoft have very specific procedural/timing requirements for releases.
---
It is easier for them to do it on PC but there's something to be said for not rushing fixes into Prod.
---
I prefer the well-tested dupe fixes instead of the silly half-assed ones they tried are first.
---
Someone forgot to take their happy pills this morning. 
---
https://nukacrypt.com/solved

Good luck!
---
My game started randomly freezing and locking on loading screens (specially when respawning). Only way out is to force terminate the game process on pc
---
Yep. Want some anger in you? I bet you do ;)
---
&gt;Martial Artist 
---
Martial Artist speeds of gun ROF?  It is only labeled for melee.
---
Lol I was playing with my wife and grandmother in Watoga and called it quits for the night. Am I pissed? Yeah, will I be on tomorrow morning? Almost for sure.
---
Same here they can nerf explosive I get that but TS is the only thing that makes a gun build playable. I will be done as well if this goes live in this form.
---
Dont need happy pills, I am happy enough that I dont play trash like F76, love :* 
---
Na my girl gives me enough lmao. Just poking the bear ;]
---
Thank you so much ! i really appreciate it !(: 
---
3 people on my friends list from game are permanent banned for duping 😂
---
They have I believe base 45% with stabilized perk, to be fair.
---
But I do agree. It takes such a small amount of armor to make minigun/lmgs tickle.
---
Really? cuz you sound like a miserable prick.
---
They can actually there is a bug under certain circumstances that allow people to steal pieces from a PA station, doesn't work every time .. I think the server lags and allows people to steal
---
I 1000% agree. I have a gun loadout, 2h loadout, unamred, crafting, daytime, night time, and two nuke variation loadouts. I have them memorized but I wish I could save and swap over managing my cards for as long as I do. 
---
You're probably not patient enough to realize this, but you do have a spawn point when that happens. You just need to search the map a bit, there will be a location available to you.
---
My hope at this point is that a lot of the stuff they did in the last 2 months are temporary stop-gap measures.
---
What I mean is, look at the "re-spec" system they added. It's garbage. Complete and utter garbage. But between this garbage and nothing, garbage is the better choice. And it took an absolute minimum amount of work to get it done. It doesn't require anything special, they just reused the existing UI (very poorly, I might add), and ghetto-patched the functionality together. It works. Sort of. It's better than nothing. And it's the same with these nerfs and "balancing", it's crude, it's lazy, it's low-effort. But it's better than nothing, which is letting TSEs dominate the scene and become utterly ubiquitous. 
---
What I hope to see is them revisiting all of these, and doing proper job of it, when the situation isn't as dire as it is now. Currently, too many things about the game are still completely broken, not to mention there isn't any kind of endgame aside from statistically-impossible RNG gear farming. They need to quickly slap together solutions to these first.
---
Basically, and again this is just my personal hope here, nothing more, is that Bethesda is in triage mode right now. They are not worried about pretty, long-term solutions, deep balancing or anything else. They're just running from patient to patient, applying tourniquets so that they don't bleed to death while they are performing plastic surgery on the first one. 
---
My camp is at whitesprings I know your pain 
---
No worries, I always put it out there just in case. If you want to buy just shoot me a DM with your PSN and I'll message you when I can get online
---
No. This is a completely debunked rumor.

Maybe something like this?
---
I see she gives you good pegging action then. Awesome! 
---
Nope. I do both melee and ranged.  I don’t limit myself to just one thing thinking there’s a one solution fits all kind of view. 
---
Super mutants have high armor. Regular bullets are the least effective. Tesla rifle does nice work on them, if they are grouped, it’s great for hitting multiple mutants at the same time.
---
What’s really great against them are frag or Nuka grenades. 
---
Cause I try all kinds of things in the game trying to find what works best on what. 
---
But I guess some people don’t bother doing that in games. 
---
Who...who hurt you?
---
Thank you so much ! 
---
But we already have an overpowered pistol 
---
No. That is not possible. It was disproven last month.
---
Now I have to go listen to this.
---
That's interesting. Thanks for the info.
---
No one can jump on to a PA station you are working on, nor access your PA equipment. You likely just lost it yourself.
---
Is the server unavailable or did you join back in?
---
I feel the same way that you do about the game. I try to convince my friends to play it with me. I really do enjoy it, but then I loved FO4 as well. They are both great games.
---
The only thing that will take me away from it is when Elder Scrolls comes out I am sure.
---
He does scream that he's looking for traders when he's nearby though, right?  That's also a pretty good identifier
---
*Golden wind outro starts*
---
I noticed this too post patch. You can hear the sounds of the world with a black screen before a second loading screen pops up then it loads in properly.
---
After 60 seconds your PA recalls back to your inventory.
---
I fucking love how much this game triggers you. Your desperate need to seek validation for your shit personality through bashing other people's opinions warms my heart. This and every post like it is so pathetic. 😂
---
Serious. Why would I want to want watch a stupid inaccurate spinning symbol instead of knowing in real time when I get to fucking play.
---
*Hot blooded murder*
---
That's very strange, you're supposed to get one generator plan (large/fusion/windmill) each time until you have them all.
---
Me? Nobody. Bethesda hurts you bethbots all day and you love being cucked. It's almost pathetic to watch. How bad of a life do you have to actually enjoy a game that the dev openly takes a shit on you every single day? How much ridicule will you endure?
---
Just got myself a 3* medic assaultron head. Just think of all the healing i can do with several hundred fusion cells.

Concentrated Fire. A fairly early card that many people forget to use. While VATS is hard to use in this game, it's extremely powerful when used correctly, especially with a high luck criticals build. 
---
Joined back- different server.
---
I think the grey knit cap goes well with the winter jacket. 
---
This. 
---
Maybe they will activate the hardened .50 and that would push the damage up. 
---
In the enclave bunker. You have to do the enclave quests.
---
You care way too much about video games

XBX1? You can get plans from the vendor in whitesprings medical bay as long as you got to the enclave quest.
---
Are you sure you're not using any ranks of Pack Rat?
---
.....lol.  Ok. I lul’d. Touché. 
---
Cutting the price in half within the first month doesn't leave me with a lot of hope that they can afford to do deep fixes in the long term. Ultimately they have to be able to pay employees to work on the game. If they can't or won't invest in quality now, they won't be able to later. 
---
Great list... I agree with most. Here's my .02:
---
\- Stop letting paper bag gifts I drop for newbies fall through the world.
---
\- Raise the level of everything on the east side of the map and let it scale into the hundreds. I want to die again.
---
\- More emotes for useful things.
---
\- Less cheesy/campy atom shop stuff.
---
\- A way to broadcast looking for a group, trading, etc.
---
\- Along with other suggested event changes make them kick off more often. Fill the world with stuff to do.
---
\- Make Scorched scary... For an enemy that supposedly overran humanity in WV they are too easy. A level 68 is mildly annoying at best. The OP already covered scorch beasts.
---
\- Scrap a modded piece of armor for a chance to learn THAT mod.
---
\- Three star legendary creatures should drop three star legendary items. Make them rarer if balance becomes an issue.
---
\- Fix ladders so they can go to either side of a foundation like FO4 and not just the middle.
---
\- Let me attach floors to foundations like I could in FO4.
---
\- Nuke zones need crazy hard bosses. That doesn't mean bullet sponges that fly off the map either.
---
If you know his GT you can go back to that server by joining game.

I did not even buy F76 tbh. It's the age where EA, bethesda, activision gets shit on. And you bots defending them are pathetic. Just miserable. They rob you and you like it. How much of a shit life do you have babe? :* 
---
check your inventory for a power chasis? It may have put itself into your inventory while you were fighting.
---
The refined .50 does one less damage than the hardened .308.
---
I gladly gave up the point for the ammo benefits.
---
Just waiting for a legendary hunting rifle to drop to put the refined .50 on it. 
---
lol. Same here. I get mad as hell, but always come back.
---
PS4, and yes, I am in the enclave. Thanks for the location! Probably wot have the caps, after I lost 132 caps for moving my camp five inches...
---
Lolol all good fun. See ya in the nuke zones!
---
No, just no. This isn’t true at all.
---
Fallout is taxing your apartment?
---
You definitely are using more ammo and taking more time to kill than me.
---
They cost 125 on XBX1.
---
doesn't help when you have idiotic lag "police" that accuse anyone in groups of two as duping.
---
Have you Ever tried a melee build? You are way way oversimplifying it and Highly overestimating the damage.
---
Once you get to level 5, shoot every player you see as a form of universal greeting that we all follow
---
Nothing, sadly
---
You get what 3 shots out of that energy weapon before it breaks? It's not that people don't like change their play style for different enemies. It's that people don't like farming months for a weapon to get to use it for a week and then have to drop it because it's so worthless. I see nerfing explosive that is what is over powered. Nerfing TS just makes gun builds un playable it's 6 rounds with a regular rifle on a dang scorched. Do they have high armor as well? No no they dont. Have fun with you OP broken melee build. 
---
Apparently no where near the shit level of yours.
---
Are you really comparing a single-player game to a multiplayer game?
---
Yeah there is definitely only a sparse few enemies out of melee reach. Though it's not fair to say you can melee anything at any time. There is still the time it takes to get into range to attack. A ranged user can engage immediately. A melee user still needs to cover ground before dealing damage. That is less of an issue when the enemy you fight is melee too because they will be heading towards you as well, meaning there is less time to engage. Ideally, a ranged user will kill the enemy as or before the melee user is close enough to even start attacking.

---
They can also be found in the world. I've nabbed them twice from a medicine chest in the place where you make excavator armor. It's in the same basement room where you build it.
---
...That's what I'm saying.  I'm saying it increases your maximum carry weight in-game because the value named 'weight' is measuring both actual weight and volume.
---
I'll race you after my double load screens stop
---
Curator ... 👀
---
I mean, obviously a better life than a bitter man child that still hangs around a place he hates.
---
Don't worry though...even if you've never heard it before, I love you &lt;3
---
That sounds about right haha, I swear there are moments when you can tell the game doesn’t want you to play it.
---
High level players are far more likely to be kind and helpful than they are there to bully you around. in my opinion, players lower level than me have always tried to be the jerk. Maybe that's out of fear of the above misunderstanding. On PC at least I know we are very nice.
---
If a high level player comes up to you, they might want to drop you some items to help out. Look at their feet for a paper bag, easy to miss for new players. That's how items are dropped. Or if they open up the trade menu, you can find what they are trying to give you by pressing the button to look at Offers (and then go to the All tab)
---
On the other hand, if you have a bounty you are a free kill. I'm not holding back on stabbing you to death and then eating your corpse. I'm just trying to help by getting that bounty off your head!
---
This is unnecessary. There are builds where you can one hit someone with a mole miner gauntlet. But no, let's nerf the fun shit. Getting a TSE shotty is the only thing that kept me playing because it was fun to just kill 7 enemies at once. I really hope they don't keep balancing around pvp.
---
born survivor is my #1 card, it’s saved my life countless times and it’s one of the first cards i get on a new character because i forget to use stimpaks manually :|
---
Gun fu for melee builds. And tenderizer is stronger than it looks for a solo player. 
---
Instead of nerfing shit they should fix stability. And add more high level enemies.  
---
I'm not a casual, I love Fallout. I won't leave though... just because I love annoying ppl like you.
---
Nice!! I have tried this so many times and never got it to work.
---
You silly goose.
---
Do your farm train. They're fun.
---
They won't be super different after the nerf.
---
I am in 110% agreement with this.
---
Do you honestly believe with all the bugs in the game, that this isn't possible smh. Some already reported he had his entire X01 stolen, it's fact, stop being naive.
---
No shit! My wife and I were wondering if other people were getting this. I got this double last night that ended in a black screen with a frozen vault symbol in the corner. Gave it a minute or two and just force closed the app lol. 
---
Actually I cherry-picked nothing. I stated a statistic given by the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics) on the average number of hours spent on an activity by the average American. I only mentioned toddlers because you failed to recognize that 'average American' took into consideration the data of ALL Americans. So when compiling the information on how much the 'average American' sleeps, this took into account **everyone**. You are either too stupid or too stubborn to recognize your error at this point.  
---
This is the exact quote:
---
&gt;In order to have played the number of hours you purport, you would have played **12.6 hours every day since November 14.** Assuming you spend the [average 8.8 hours daily sleeping](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.t12.htm#tus_tu_nr12.f.2) (this includes naps and periods of sleeplessness as stated on the linked page's footnotes), this leaves **2.6 hours every day for everything else.**
---
You appear to have a comprehension problem. I am not sure if you don't comprehend [averages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average), or can't comprehend [how clicking on links works](https://www.quora.com/What-happens-when-we-click-on-a-hyperlink-on-a-web-page), or that the BLS's data is some of the most accurate data available on this topic, or that when a report speaks of a 'civilian population' it means **everybody***,* [including children](https://www.census.gov/topics/population/children.html)*.* I also don't think you understand what '[cherry picking](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cherry-pick)' means since I clearly took the total numbers of hours listed under 'Sleeping' and went to the 'Annual Average' column to give the average total. Cherry picking would have been citing a lower quarterly average, such as Quarter I's 8.76 hours or a higher value such as QIII's 8.93 hours , in order to make the total seem more extreme in this case. Hell i even specified that the total included naps and periods of sleeplessness, which if anything, makes the total seem LESS extreme.   
---
In conclusion, you are an argumentative idiot who had nothing to base your denial on other than you didn't think it sounded right and "*didn't put much stock in it*" Facts are fucking facts, my friend. Your ignorance or inability to understand simple statistics (even when given the actual sourced material in plain English as prepared by a unbiased government agency) is not my problem.   
---
For the last time, The average American sleeps (including naps and periods of sleeplessness) 8.8 hours a day. THIS THE AVERAGE OF **ALL** AMERICANS REGARDLESS OF AGE, GENDER, RELIGION OR READING COMPREHENSION. Your "putting stock" in that data is irrelevant to it's accuracy.   
---
Now please, I can have more insightful conversations with a rock at this point. Please, go read a book or something. 
---
Check all first aid boxes, Dr's bags and chem boxes with the perk equipped. Soon you'll be giving the things away to make room
---
Bingo hence why better. 
---
Rifles use a .45 Long Colt, which is significantly larger than a .45 acp round, and a .44 
---
Real World scenarios don't matter though, Cause this if Fallout, and it's all fantasy, otherwise you would only need a .22 pistol to head shot everything.
---
I haven't found any human corpses I can eat, but any dead Ghouls/Scorched/Super Mutants are fair game no matter who killed them.
---
I've been eyeballing Tenderizer. It sounds like it could be really handy.
---
Two Shot *isn't* a constant damage bonus though. Both shots have to hit.
---
When used with explosive it's much less of an issue because of the AoE effect. But with a Two-Shot automatic gun you are *never* going to hit all your additional shots.
---
She died many many times long before TSE became commonplace. It just made it low to no effort instead of trying to create a good build.
---
I'm a pistol user only visible ones are pipe bolt action and and pipe revolver 
---
Ghouls are easy kills, low risk still decent XP. You basically have 4 big concentrations.
---
I don’t know of any other place you can just rotate through and get the same XP relatively consistently.
---
It’s always reclamation day though so this is not a problem.
---
Why would I pay to ‘try’ this? If it was free yeah but it’s not and it definitely doesn’t look worth shelling 60 quid out for...
---
I got a copy of the plan in a container while ding the find the mayor quest in Watoga.
---
Legendary effects should be craft able. Make the BP's a one time usage so that the market doesnt get flooded with TSE weapons (not that Duping hasnt already done this). I feel this is the best solution over complete removal.
---
The only one I've ever had happen was the stamina glitch.  It was cool when it happened, but it's not needed.  I really don't care what others do as long as what they are doing is not causing my game performance to go in the shitter.
---
You have to be standing completely still, and for cavalier its not just moving you have to fully sprint, so its not as OP imo
---
Right! I main Melee but I use a handmade with Tormentor 3 on queen so i can cripple all the limbs while others do damage. Then I help attack after she is fully crippled.
---
No, but I probably will going forward.
---
Probably because one day they might start releasing good updates.
---
aluminum and lead, with lead being the best thing to bulk, apparently now also cork, oil, gears, springs, and copper, but I haven't actually tested those 
---

---
You know what you're about, and I respect that.
---
If its possible then provide video evidence, its not that hard. 
---
Remember when everyone said it was possible to "steal" items through trade? That was debunked. 
---
Do you really think a bug like stealing armor like this would go unnoticed by the entire community? 
---
There is mg42? I want one 
---
I found an explosive LMG once...I gave it to someone for free.  No regrets.
---
I bond with your mom while you play.
---
If you're talking about the black powder pistol... But I want something powerful that doesn't take forever to reload after a single shot.
---
&gt;charging you 60 dollars for it
---
Oh no....a whole 2 hours of my work week wasted....
---
Yeah I can back after a month and my game crashed within 15 minutes... Fuck Fallout 76
---
In a game where ammo isn't supposed to be everywhere...automatic weapons dealing the same damage as semiautomatics would be okay.  As it is, because of DR and ER calculations, dealing lower damage multiple times often means you're chewing through more ammo doing fractions of the same damage.
---
This is really well done thanks for sharing
---
They do not since it's based on weight which they're saying is lower with long barrel...
---
Can a male wear it?  Never tried...
---
preach !
---
They try. The other day a guy was trying to get me to PVP. He was annoying.
---
Then idk. If you're on PC I have plenty of black titanium to craft you another set this evening.

This is where to buy and sell
---
A missile launcher is not suppose to be a main weapon and its purpose is used for attacking groups of mobs and it does a really good job of it.
---
You have a lot of anger pent up from besides this game, man. You gotta let that out in a healthy way... Let someone massage that chip out of your shoulder
---
Same principle, count how many enemies in the game are melee, and count how many enemies are ranged. You'll run out of digits very quickly on the melee front. Vast majority of all enemies in this game are melee, considering how many of "ranged" enemies (Mole Miners, Supermutants, Scorched and Robots) will still prefer to come at you and melee you. 
---
Remember back in the day when FO3 was announced, and people said it was "Oblivion with guns"? Nothing has changed since then. It's still Oblivion with guns. And Oblivion was mostly melee.
---
Even if ranged can kill the enemy before the enemy is in melee range, remember the loot. You still have to go where each individual enemy fell, and loot them. Melee does this organically - short teleport with VATS, 1-shot kill, loot-all, move to the next enemy. Even in this respect, melee is arguably superior.
---
I'm on PS4 :(
---
Every single possible advantage... until a TSE pump shotgunning lvl 15 attacks...
---
I just ignore anyone that initiates PvP anymore, especially if they are lvl 30 or below because, despite rifle bashing me with that pipe rifle, they inevitibly pull out that explosive pump shotgun they bought from some super. 
---
Did you perhaps put down the wrong frame?  You can't tell them apart in your inventory.
---
You should have sex with her.

I mean I'll take it off your hands if you want...for a fee ;) 😂

Grammar: No idea what Crazycammy199349 thinks there doing but i know for a fact they don't even know that there ding just winging it
---
Wow you are a complete moron ..
---
He doesn't even play the game, ignore this asshat.
---
Too bad long barrels consistently have lower WG than short.
---
A pistol grip sawed off weighs significantly more than a double barrel with a full barrel and stock. Makes no sense. 
---
And with what bobbles or mags do you pair it?
---
TSE still going to be one of the highest damage combos. 
---
&gt; have already come a very long way
---
Your standards and expectations of them are below olympic limbo records.
---
Two Words: Mounting Bracket
---
Which is dumb. I bet theres a lot of disappointed cowboys out there.
---
That's what you do in the endgame or EVERY Fallout since Fallout 3... you become a one man army.
---
Reminds me of that Guantanamo bay controversy picture
---
Please provide detailed info on how balancing is done if they aren't changing damage values. Be specific.
---
Good argument. 
---
Edited to reduce the stats
---
have you done every event? can you make all the armor? Are you sitting on fully maxed out armor sets of light medium and heavy? Do you have every single weapon plan? How about every vanity item in the C.A.M.P.? 
---
if you go into any forums of true MMORPGs, they also turn in to fashion quests end game while waiting for new content. Also helping out guildies and building up supplies. Maybe leave white springs and drop everything you possibly can drop in the game. If you feel it's too boring then there's always destiny
---
Easy content boys. Thanks for giving me footage for my video. Now dont be too harsh on yourselves. Its no coincidence that on the right it says 170k 'dwellers'. It suits you well. See you on youtube :\* 
---
Bingo... which is a real low blow.
---
Only Gatling and Laser Gatling.
---
It's clearly a bug.
---
I agree with this but you could not get tse in fallout 4 without mods, you could only get o e legendary effect on a weapon or armor in 4 without modding the game
---
My Furious Faster Firing Gatling will be juuuuuuust fine.
---
Perhaps the same way convertibles weigh more than hard tops. Your sawed off is all floppy now and needs 6lbs of duct tape! 
---
dey tuk err jerbs!
---
All of them... just be sure to log out and back in every 59 minutes. 😬👌
---
Every time i fast travel i get stuck in a loading screen, ive only just started playing the game :/ 
---
The evil dupers dupe a tiny, but still heavy, invisible sawed off inside your sawed off that adds weight.
---
Enclave bunker medical wing terminals. Always has them.
---
I know for me I had no idea that it stacks with each hit. I only have one rank of it and it’s a huge difference. 
---
What rubbish, there have been multiple accounts of people having people stolen. OP isn't going to make it up plus there was someone who had his X01 stolen and was on the front page for months. Who one who is debunking this is full of it and a complete idiot, with this many bugs in the game, ANYTHING is possible, idiots.
---
Because the 100% bonus is so great it out weighs using power patcher. 
---
And I find I rarely am actually tossing grenades. I’ve got like a hundred nuka grenades, but mostly I just shoot things in the head w/ my pistol or blow them up w/ a grenade launcher.
---
I’ve thought about re-pivoting towards more melee+grenades, but I’m honestly thinking about dropping Demo Expert so I can just throw them at my feet.
---
I have 3, 2 of which were(and still are) stored in my camp
---
Thats a hard no
---
Its called the lmg and I've actually only ever found 3 , they don't spawn anywhere and are random drops, they suck though so I'm,hoping they get a buff 
---
Except they're preventing TS weapons from dropping post patch, so a TS hunting rifle will be rare even if nerfed. 
---
I have to second this, really. It's pretty obvious they decided to make it do less damage to balance out it being easier to craft, but it really only "needs" to be so easy to craft for the machine gun - if having the rifle use a separate ammo type that's not as easy to craft in mass quantities would be the trade-off for having it do the damage it should, I'd be quite alright with that!
---
You tied with my wife.  Last night was her first time getting on solo too. Woke up to forum level complaining this morning lol.
---
Had this issue too. Look in your pipboy and find the name of the Holo right above the Master tape. Then in the terminal, find that holo you looked up and select the one just below it. 
---
5lbs of tape holding the mod onto the gun?
---
omg the world is ending!
---
I’m not referring to just TS,
---
I’m referring to items with both. TSE dragon can one shot scorchbeasts with the right perk cards.
---
You abandoned it and someone picked it up.  Sounds like this is on you, dude.
---
Tbh: Even with decent damage the MG42 would suck on account of the ammo being used, compared to the .50 and 5mm.
---
I agree - the enclave need to wipe clean the radiated scum of the wasteland
---
No idea where I got mine, but I can craft if you’re on PS4.
---
Please post a link, should be fun. :)
---
They changed that did they not there just nerfing them 
---
Bandolier, some ammunition (5MM) literally becomes weightless. 
---
I do agree lol still though 
---
weird, I 1-shot lvl68 super mutants with my non two shot, non explosive shotgun all the time.
---
Ahhh the long play revenge... so satisfying 
---
Yeah I feel that. I was pretty annoyed at how many “essential” NPCs there were in FO4. 
---
Interesting...
---
we need breakfast and lunch options. 
---
I don't know what you're trying to say, that's not a sentence.
---
Thanks, much appreciated. :)
---
Lol very inventive 👍
---
The only way that could've happened is using the infinitely stacking explosive bobbleheads exploit.
---
The queen has ridiculously high explosive resistance. Hitting her with non exploit boosted explosive damage does little to nothing. 
---
So, you come to a Fallout 76 dedicated subreddit just to shit on people who legitimately enjoy the game and can see Bethesda is making improvements? Real good use of time there, guy. You’re why the gaming community can be toxic. 
---
They're\*
---
Only needs the bear rug but yeah looks good 👍
---
They could for PC at least. A lot of gaming companies already operate like that.
---
Well guess what. They are nerfing both into the ground to the point where you might as well drop them and re roll melee. I can see nerfing explosive but as is said without a TS a rifle build isn't playable. 
---
This is just me venting lol. I’m not as mad as I am annoyed. The only bug that has actually infuriated me in this game was when my game made the console hard freeze, OS got corrupted, and I had to format my console and reinitialize it. I posted about it but didn’t even get an upvote lol
---
Dude are you drunk or high? Your OP was a mess and I don't even know what the hell this gibberish is supposed to mean. 
---
Ffs im Scottish give me a break 😂.look at the news they have discluded the part about tse not dropping... They are now only nerfing the weapon 
---
Totally forgot about the bear rugs, gunna have to grab it.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a6o5td/psa\_your\_power\_armor\_can\_be\_stolen/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a6o5td/psa_your_power_armor_can_be_stolen/)
---
Yeah such a cool gun but it’s crap for damage with no mods and 308 is some of the more expensive ammunition 
---
Ok I feel like you are not writing out a part of your thinking here because it isn’t making any sense right now.
---
I’ll ask again: why is it necessary to nerf Demo Expert?
---
Theyll still drop. They retracted that part. Tse will only be nerfed not removed.
---
Ah, forgot about that one.  There's a couple spots I hit, but for whatever reason, the cores are always 50%.
---
I think TSE is still going to be the flavour of the month.
---
As it is now it’s too strong. But if it’s still scaling off the same perk cards like it is now I think you can probably still pull off high damage numbers. Just not one shorting scorchbeast damage.
---
Wow gotta love the grammar police, how do we live without them?!?  😂😂
---
Who said anything about fortnite?
---
Show us on the bobblehead where the Red Dead Online griefers touched you.
---
I get way more than three shots out of it before it breaks. It’s a regular old Tesla rifle. Not all energy weapons break at the same rate. The laser pistols and rifles certainly break fast.
---
The thing is, all my weapons and armor have the most durability because of 15 INT and the right perks. Which also slow down the rate of breakage.
---
My melee weapon is a modded Shishksbob. It does 150 damage, medium speed, which I use Martial to increase weapon speed. Also have perks for increased damage with one and two handed weapons.
---
Before that it was a modded legendary three star fire axe. Did more damage when creature was below 40% health, reflected 50% back when blocking and I forget the last one.
---
I’ve got rank 4 demolitions which puts my grenade damage way up there. Grenadier gives me a visual throwing arc so I know where my grenades are going to land. Also wider blast radius. 
---
My friends give me all the nuka and quantum and drag grenades so I can make those grenades. 
---
My armor lasts a very long time because of int and perks. Plus that not every fight is melee. 
---
And I never farmed a single time in the game. I do events, I do quests, I do everything but farm. I take full advantage of the game. It’s amazing where I’ve found plans that people have been searching forever for, complaining about spending days served hoping.
---
I’ve got screws, gears, springs and ballistic fibers coming out of my ears. 
---
I’m not lucky. I’m taking advantage of how this  game is designed and yawing all of it. Not just a few select area. Because I read someone said. 
---
I simply play the game. Pay attention, learn and use what I’ve learned. 
---
But you keep grinding Shitesprings for that magical legendary that will make it all worthwhile.
---
Also Shitesprings was a typo. But I decided to leave it.
---
Yeah also i now got a sloth while searching for a new dclaw,and the new one takes an additional 10%. I was hoping that it would overwrite the ghost 10%..nope.
---
So next time this one dies,i'm gonna say goodbye to 20 f ing % of budget forever.
---
Wait wait wait. The percentage stacks *each hit*? That's huge.
---
That just how they were and it acts as a nerf
---
Seeing the downvotes this post will be gone within the hour. 
---
Stimpaks are nice and all, especially with diluted chemist super duper combo. But if you are in a pinch, try Healing Salves. In a hour of going around with green thumb, you can get enough mats for 300 of them that heal for 20% instantly each
---
Super high and Scottish 😊 
---
Ah, that's a great point.  Next time.
---
Notice I said Frank Horrigan first... obviously the real USSS works very differently. I like being a Frank Horrigan heavy weapons build. 
---
I honestly don't remember the specifics of FO4, but most of the issues were copy-pasted over. Like shotguns. Big thing is that shotgun + explosive, made it too powerful. In FO4, it was Explosive and Bleeding shotguns that were grotesquely overpowered. Bethesda never fixed it, not in many years the game has been out. Similarly, you could take a full set of Sentinel's armor in FO4, and make yourself pretty much invulnerable (since VATS melee did not count as "moving" even though Blitz teleported you, and Rooted also worked in VATS). And so on.
---
They made **zero** attempts to take their long-standing, poorly balanced single player game, and rebalance it when they released it as a multiplayer game. They just copy-pasted everything (including bugs) into this game and called it a day, slapping a full AAA-tier price tag on it. Something that a lot of people will be reminded of, if they don't recall it themselves, every time Bethesda releases anything else in foreseeable future. 
---
Haha thanks, I've not looked it up since the first announced it. I wasn't trying to insult how you speak, I just couldn't understand haha
---
I've got 115 black titanium you can have.
---
My lvl 21 ran through 700+ rounds on a lvl 40 something deathclaw using my sweet auto 10mm after my rifle broke a minute before he showed up.
---
Well ita easy to find, and a lot of people tend to drop it , by level 50 u usually have more than a thousand 
---
Oh cool, thanks!
---
All yours.
---
Always happy to help anyone considering joining the Cannibal Club!
---
Ah, its completely justified.  We are both enjoying the game, so its easy to move past, but its definitely there and we don't dismiss it blindly.  The voting on this sub is odd, I would wait a bit and see how it turns out. 
---
Lol use the lmg more I mean it’s more expensive to craft and you need thousands for that gun not saying it’s hard to find but the damage per bullet is a little rough haha
---
What is the point of doing all that shit when all you do is nuke whitesprings or kill SBQ? There is no content that justifies all that grinding. That is the difference between this game and actual MMOS.
---
Id love to see that return and the marksman rifle. I hate the assault rifles apperance so much. Id also like the victory rifle to come back.
---
Guns will now shoot silly strings and blood will be replaced with confetti
---
lol OK carry on then! 
---
Hahaha I keep reading it and it's fucking hilarious by the way :)
---
Funny. Ive tried to do this many times, at im always unsuccessful.  
---
So i dont care what anyways says.  Its not possible.   
---
Ok I've got 20 gears 18 oil and 20 screws you can have
---
Lol thanks saved me a job 😂
---
I have this same screenshot. I had to recreate it after beta. Still makes me giggle. 
---
"Fix every bug immediately you assholes!"
---
at the same time
---
"Not that one, you assholes!"
---
Instigating explosive is possible though, and is insane.
---
I know that's why its staying the way it is ,😂 
---
yeah you would think they would at least have raiders in this game 
---
I've had issues with lag, freezing, etc. since beta.
---
I think it’s BS too. Just nerf explosive. Two shot by itself is a great gun affix and not at all broken. Oh well.
---
Wow. Thanks man. Really appreciate it
---
Sure. Outside of the multiplayer component, and a few other smaller additions, the two games are nearly identical. One of the most fundamental gameplay loops for both games involves the collection of loot. This entire mechanic is greatly strained in 76 due to the current storage/weight limitations. I love 76, but I feel like I’m spending almost 40% of my time just balancing my inventory and stash - when i would rather be exploring and hoarding loot. 
---
There, there. Everything will be ok.

So you want help finding where to put points for the alt or the main? Which one will be using the rifle?
---
It happens often. Usually atleast one person will drop the server or the entire game will crash. 
---
Yeah, I’ve been playing fallout since 01 and I love the series.From a fallout perspective I can see why people hate it, but it’s been one of the most enjoyable games to play with my spouse I can remember. And as an ?mmo? I love it. It’s mindless fun. I don’t know how many weeks ago I got the 76hrs playtime challenge complete lol
---
base damage without perks. 
---
I want to shed some weight, I really do, now give me a merchant to sell it to.
---
So no turning in place?
---
It all says the same thing who gives a shit really ...apart from the grammar police obviously!!  I'm not submitting an essay, i wrote a post super high sue me 😉
---
I'm down, are you able to at least talk on discord using your phone or is it just text chat?
---
Still no video. 
---
Yeah they look like a Lewis gun reproduced with a super soaker😂 
---
Your perceptions of time to kill is not ideal for ranged users. I can accept it takes you five seconds to kill a level 50 scorchbeast if you can accept it takes me 20 seconds with my non-TSE gun. 
---
How long does it take for a scorchbeast to land on average? 60 seconds? 30 seconds? If it takes me 20 seconds to kill a scorchbeast, and you need to wait 30 seconds before it lands for you, it takes you 15 more seconds than me to kill the enemy. 
---
Just because the damage number is higher doesn't mean it is better. I can begin dealing my damage well before you are able to start yours. I'd also wager my damage per second is likely higher as well. Melee is not superior in every aspect.
---
Thiccc
---
If someone stole it, they would have stole everything, not just the arms.
---
&gt;Tenderizer
---
I don't think it stacks. 
---
FYI, if you search the board here for ban, banned, etc you see a lot of posts here.  More on Facebook groups and Discord.  I was pretty skeptical about it also but there are a lot of reports now.  A lot of people are claiming they are innocent, which I was even more skeptical of.  But in there defense I searched there buy/sell posts here and the things they were buying and selling seemed to indicate they did not have duper like resources.  Looks like only effected about 10-20% of dupers.
---
No worries add me I'll bring them over to you. 
---
I did this to my friend and we were dying laughing
---
R/wtf
---
A build with a different special point distribution?
---
Ya, though I thought it was my bad Internet 
---
They are in the sense of what pvp fundamentally is. Halo and counter strike are fundamentally different but if one of them had an issue where certain areas of the map made one side invulnerable, then there’d be a problem. Either let players kill each other or don’t. If the game intended for wanted people to die without having the chance to fight back then your character may as well just die automatically  every time you attacked someone.
---
I have the materials, and sent you a request
---
I only had the arms
---
Sled? What are you Canadian?
---
"These claws ain't just for attracting mates!"
---
Nope! When they're converted from a stack of bulk screws into loose screws, they disappear. What you're describing is the intended behaviour, but it does not happen. 
---
Or simply rename .50 to .50 BMG since that is the gun we are actually using, and add just regular  .50 cal ammo
---
So for example if the base is 100 damage, right now the damage goes up to 300 because of the two shot and explosive?  But after nerf, with a base of 100, the damage would only be 120?
---
I actually posted a video here yesterday that was how I see the world after playing Fallout 76. It's a montage of real world items and the components they yield. I put it on YouTube if you want to check it out. 
---
https://youtu.be/Fy2Xu-eKAXk
---
TSE is still the most damaging combination on a ranged weapon. Oh yeah I guess Bloodied can drop with 25% faster fire rate so maybe there will be a new chase legendary to roll for
---
I think full inventory looting should be the reward.. something like rust or ark 
---
Im not talking about the shotguns, just pistols and SMGs. I havent used shotguns a whole lot, but they seem just fine balance wise.
---
It's for your benefit. I don't care how your write but you might want to care.
---
Also means u can’t use it in PA
---
Stylish! 
---
“I prefer syrup”
---
I too suffer from constipation when I get baked up. I hear it's a common side effect.
---
Daddy, stretch me.
---
didn't your mother scold you about letting bats in the house?
---
For sure. You successfully referenced the “Dog” character from Fallout New Vegas though and that knowledge is enough for this sub. 
---
Man I wonder if its even accessible yet. Has anyone figured this out yet?
---
Not really. Look at some other builds. Like melee. But ok.
---
Username?
---
It’s not hard it’s annoying, my bad.
---
I love the game but my affinity to hoard in it has made it so the majority my time managing my stash and weight so I am not over encumbered and that's starting to get old. But the addiction is real
---
I'd honestly argue against this. It should be passively built-in into gun classes, not require perks. Why? Because certain perks are already *mandatory*. For example, if you go melee, you MUST take Martial Artist and Incisor. It's not debatable. Every single melee build will have these. That's what a perk that increases penetration on guns would do - make a mandatory 3-5 pointer for everyone to take. 
---
If we want variety of builds, and creativity, we must move *away* from mandatory perks, not create more of them.
---
Sorry professor i shall done try gooder next time 
---
If you can't PvP because someone has a better weapon than you.....try fortnight.
---
Uggmiest
---
they really just need to split budget into general and defense, maybe a third for resources for water and plants but a separate defense budget would be awesome
---
More people comment to correct someone's grammar than they do to argue
---
Not trying to rub it in, but with Pharma farm I am sitting on 120 stim packs and 38 super stimpacks. It is a really great perk, and I only have rank 1.
---
They're not in the business of buffing.
---
Ask your wife to post a tutorial
---
Yeah but I usually just buy in,bulk u know ?
---
And it’s such a necessity once you try it. I really can’t imagine playing with out it. Even just switching between a regular build and a lockpick/hacker build quickly increases enjoyment so much.
---
The alt. 
---
Agreed 😂, rather amusing tbh 
---
The forced choices of only siding with one faction with the requirement to destroy all the others was lame IMO.  Also, the total asshollery of the BOS after Maxson became a lunatic was annoying for me. They've always been secretive and a little xenophobic, but the BOS of the Capital Wasteland was my ideal.  Kept to themselves mostly, but also aided other people with Project Purity and wiped out the Enclave.  From 3-4 they become total dicks, and undeservedly so.  They took out an option where you can get the Synth to take over leadership too.  Quite frankly, the ending needed the option to be able to bring together a coalition of at least several of the groups.  The BOS and Minutemen should have worked together, the Railroad could have also been involved.  Taking over the Institute as the son, or convincing the Father to go into cryosleep until a cure is found for his condition, or even uploading his mind into a Synth should have been an option.
---
They just dropped the ball writing wise.  The mechanics and features of the game was great.  The writing? Needed another pass.
---
They REALLY need a brief invulnerability period on load. 
---
Road leathers have a skull and crossbones at the belt. Dunno if you'd care for the rest of the outfit though. Other problem being that your armor would cover it.
---
Theres been a few times when i was a lower level that i just quit and loaded back in haha. Like what you described above. Just wasnt worth the ammo.
---
I'd love to see a before and after version. 
---
Hell I’ll take fewer legendary drops if most “legendary” items were worth a damn. I feel like BSG doesn’t know what legendary means. 
---
ok have you tested this out i take it?
---
Would be nice to have some sort of PVP goals associated with nukes. "The raiders have targeted  the BoS!" And maybe some way to combat/stop the nuke, or just a valiant defense of their nuked areas. I've always wanted a raiders vs BoS pvp lol, give me your chems and guns!!
---
Why? That’s a bit random.
---
Rust and ark also have permadeath
---
Yeah. Kind of annoying, really.
---
Last night in the Cranberry Bog I was complaining about how I had to deal with 2 ordinary scorchbeasts  with my explosive pump action. After taking care of them, I turn around and see 3 more.. 
---
Nah, I think some Kenny G fits this better...
---

Just about bats in my belfry!
---
Though raiders vs responders is probably more appropriate 
---
God I love these comments.
---
I’ve been training ghouls at Harpers Ferry on non suspecting plebs for awhile now. I wait a solid 10 if they don’t die right away before I execute them
---
i am on ps4 any clues how i can do that?
---
This is honestly my first that caught my attention honestly. Never had much issue with lag or disconnects after first zoning in
---
Well, as long as it doesn't have white eyes and a cowl, you're safe.
---
Somewhat related, but what annoys me is that we can't rebind the wheel controls. What I mean is, I'm in VATS, and I'm trying to scroll down, which targets the enemy's head (why is scroll-DOWN aiming UP at the head anyway?!), but I run out of AP as I'm doing it, and instead this opens the quick-select wheel, which blocks off my entire center screen and I can't see jack shit. 
---
I also rebound crouch to C. Which means in VATS I can't crouch and uncrouch, because C is hard-coded to "next target" in the UI, and no way to change that either.
---
I just want interior maps
---
Nope we gettin our own servers so hopefully this will suffice for you guys on the pve side of things too hopefully
---
just asked she said no she is very shy
---
1. Born Survivor. For one point, it'll save your life almost every time.
---
2. Rejuvenated. It's very easy to keep yourself well-fed and hydrated, and there aren't a lot of other Perks in END worth having outside of some specific builds.
---
3. Concentrated Fire. One point is all you need for easier headshots.
---
4. Adrenaline. Great way to easily stack 36% more damage; particularly when fighting mobs that horde up, like Scorched and Super Mutants. (Helps hugely when fighting SBs, too, as you can pop off their spawns to keep this topped off.)
---
For me I always have the problem of my character looking great in the creator, but then I get into the game and they look like they had an addiction to meth 
---
Yuuup, that's been my fight, too. I got stuck in a cycle of needing the Excavator to hold all my stuff which meant I always had to spend some time hunting for power cores which only added to my weight problem... Trying to be more ok with not having stuff immediately on hand. 
---
Anti-Materiel rifle needs to be implemented.
---
YES i have that problem too especially in mass effect. 
---
Any attempt to use explosives requires bear arms. Otherwise the weight is too much. 
---
Haha I understand that just saying because all of mine are just pre-sets until I can fix them later. Nice of Bethesda to make changing face/body/sex free
---
Sounds good I’ll be online in like 30 minutes 
---
It does? Is there any testing to confirm this? 
---
If so, I'm about to go swap some SPECIAL around.
---
Uh.. well.. if its any matter RnG has always hated me.. so.. yeah. 
---
On the other side of the coin tho attempt 4 another player was amazed how fast i was in getting perfect start. 
---
Med x. And rad x. Zero bullets. 
---
This was the first I noticed after buying it ...so it went in my stash :( 
---
I'm not sure how you posted the first and last photos without the caption "Space Jam".
---
With hard bargain maxed it's like 98 caps for the plan. 
---
Two shot 100% to 25%
---
Explosive 100% to 20%
---
It will be brutal because the base damage (the part not effected) on a handmade is pretty low.
---
You will lose about 62% damage in total, when you have all rifleman perks, demolition expert and bloody mess. Scroll through todays posts. There was aguy doing all the math. It should answer all questions. But the tldr is you‘ll lose ~62% dmg
---
It's a loot game bruh......
---
There's always going to be guns, mutations, and builds better than what you have.
---
What did you expect?
---
True. When I played Diablo 3 every rare drop had redeemable qualities and could be used. In FO76 you get legendaries that no one would ever use.
---
What i tried to say ^^ 🤣
---
That's fair enough, I'm glad the game is still fun with a powerful weapon, something I've yet to try. Sometime but I'm not in a hurry.
---
Yeh really sucks. And sucks how armor doesn’t stay “on” while on PA but I understand. I’m running unarmed unyielding build. Rocks outside Pa
---
Also don't worry about the tactical scope part of it. Just kill the horde and you still get credit.
---
the only thing less impacted by the nerf anymore
---
Read more carefully, did not say they aren't changing values they are and according to the patch notes they are removing combinations of tse from the random lot generator.( main concern for major issues) especially with all the different combinations of legendary perks or rolls.
---
I've had luck with neither. I think it must be a problem with a few servers. If this happens to you just restart your game and try another server.
---
I personally didn't have any problem understanding what you were saying. My grammar sucks a lot of the time too. It just makes it easier for people to understand if you get it as good as you can. 
---
Did you play old gen gta online? Making a half decent character was next to impossible
---
They're more rare but you'd love the 50 cal
---
both feel like a longshot at this point if you ask me..
---
Drugs yes, food no.  You can totally have more than one food/drink at a time as long as they are different food/drinks.  
---
In ark you respawns your character from bed or random spawn points but you inventory is left on your dead body. Ark does have a permadeath mode too however I've never played it. 
---
Incase you haven't noticed white springs hardly ever gets a nuke dropped on it anymore. Personally I can't stand energy weapons and will never use one. It's cute that your friends give you stuff but that's not the case for everyone. Yes my legendarys are focused towards my build. Is that not how its meant to be? Does that some how make it ok to be forced to reroll or have the game be unplayable when I built a toon around the game they designed? I love how your trying to sound like you know the game well when your playing melee and that has been more op than TSE since day one. Have fun playing an empty game with no way to reliably kill the queen bud.
---
So melee getting to hit 5k damage is fine. Ranged hitting for 200? Not so fine?
---
Honestly nerf super mutant warlord health, make them less common, or make the reward greater.  Tired of groups of 7 or more of those assholes in every spawn point when you're at a higher level. They're not even challenging, they're just ammo sinks.
---
Hah!
---
I'd argue we simply need "join last server" option. You don't necessarily need a checkpoint if you can just return back to what you were doing before you got disconnected.

Dude fair play I get it. Im more than aware of how and what i write 90% of the time. This once i was super high and wrote a post like I would send a quick text to my friend, now im literally dying laughing at some of theese comments.. Its all fun im taking 0 offence 😎
---
I have the max rank and I find so much stuff I’m at a point I’m just leaving it
---
Not like there's anything else to spend caps on since beta. Why you assume the end game is bigger than this is beyond me.
---
I don’t get your point about the “choose one faction destroy all others”, probably because I sided Institute/Minutemen, but everything else makes sense.
---
I wasn’t looking at it as a good fallout game, I was looking at it as a good game in general

I want .338 lapua... That's THE sniper round.  Long range, and deadly accurate.
---
I used to, but like everyone says, they took up too much of my C.A.M.P.’s budget for me to properly furnish the place so I got rid of them.
---
ooh she thicc
---
I'm not stupid, I know how black powder guns worked. That's not the point. We still need a better pistol.
---
YES.
---
.50 cal should automatically apply the Bloody Mess perk.
---
Wow.  Still that's fine!  I don't want to one shot everything.   I just love suppressed handmade popping off sound.  And 290 damage is still pretty good, and I still have melee for those scorched bastards.  Thanks guys!
---
Nerf headshots, and sniper rifles. Sniper rifles should lose 1% damage for every 1 feet of distance.
---
Numbness will subside in several minutes.
---
GLORIOUS SPRINGS!  \*throws confetti\*
---
Agreed. I would be more concerned with an anti armor explosive shotgun anyways. Two shot only adds 1 pellet, but anti armor knocks off 50% of their armor
---
You understood me ? You should win a prize good sir 😂 
---
Aside from the plans, do more of the daily/weekly quests. I get a lot of stimpacks and radaway just from doing those.

Also drink some [Steeped Fern Flower Tea](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Steeped_fern_flower_tea) as well for another +2 strength.  Also if you go hunting for eggs you can get the recipe for [Deathclaw Wellington](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Deathclaw_wellington_(Fallout_76)) which is better than just deathclaw steak (+3 str instead of +2 and it lasts an hour instead of 30 minutes.).  
---
I’m only gonna do this once for you because that kind of argument barely deserves a response as it is.
---
Those are two completely different situations. Halo is team death match, the point of that is to attack and kill each other. An event in Fallout 76 is a team co-op objective. The only time your point makes sense is in the few PvP event zones, which as far as I know work fine. You attempted to compare two when the objectives and intent behind the situations are fundamentally different. You are not thinking this through and it shows.
---
I have been wandering a lot, looking for a good spot with existing buildings or features to make an interesting little camp. This is very well done!
---
You can double the duration through perks, but the 3 points cost just isn't worth it imo.
---
Until yesterday I was of the same opinion as you, that the cores lasted long enough for me and that I had an ample supply of them at all times. Which is why I think what happened after I used a bobble head bugged my character and reduced the duration of the cores by 50-75% of what it was earlier, instead of doubling the duration, like it was supposed to. 
---
5 points strength minimum, 2 for bandolier, 1 for each level of shotgun damage or melee damage of your choice (for a solid backup weapon when enemies get too close)
---
Endurance is mostly used for survival cards so that's all up to you
---
2 points minimum in charisma, 1 for suppresor, 1 for tenderizer
---
9 points minimum in perception, 3 for rifleman, 2 for master rifleman, 1 for expert rifleman, 3 for tank killer
---
Rifles work best in sneak crit builds so 8 points minimum in agility, 1 for escape artist, 2 for sneak, 3 for covert ops, 2 for adrenaline
---
3 points minimum in luck for bloody mess (15% extra damage to everything)
---
5 points minimum in Intelligence for gunsmith
---
That only covers up to level 34 but those are the bare essentials for a rifle build. The rest is completely up to you
---
Well since you asked so nicely~
---
Same with foxes. They never attack even when near so i wont attack them.  But chickens suffer quick death unless i already have 5 chicken soups
---
It's one of the things I wish games did more often - let us save and share our character appearance. Mass Effect 2 did it beautifully. As you make a character, the game gives you an alphanumeric string. You can post it anywhere, send it anywhere. When copied into the game, this string will generate a character that looks *exactly* like yours. So people who are good at making decent-looking characters can easily share those strings, and then individual players can tweak those to their preference. Worked great. And this was what, 9 years ago?
---
If you're fighting more than one enemy and aren't super powered up with suppressors and that uber drop combat stealth perk, then you're not exactly going to be stealthing through the whole fight, are you? :p
---
As I said, a situational ability, not a static buff.
---
Oh my god I failed on that one! 
---
Fux flux...
---
Uh wow I was hoping you’d have something better than that. “Nerf this perk because it doesn’t fit my specific build on my one character” is an argument that doesn’t even deserve a response beyond: haha, no.
---
Oh it had some bugs, but overall the gameplay and features were excellent and directly led to us getting F76.  I was just pissed with the story options.  By siding with the Brotherhood I literally had to destroy all the other factions. Did the Institute not require you to destroy everyone else?  I know they require the BOS to die, which is why I couldn't go through with it and see the Prydwen go down.
---
Idk, I'm closing in on 100 hours, and imo PvP is almost always one sided. Either I smoosh them near instantly or they smoosh me, but I can't remember the last time I fought a real player where we actually exchanged blows and reassessed our tactics.
---
Situational legendary effects should be the only ones in the game anyway. Why should a rifleman build be OP with a TSE Shotgun or .50 cal or any TSE weapon for that matter. Perks like instigating, bloodied, furious which are much more class specific and situational should have been the norm from the beginning. 
---
It’ll all blow over and people will find a new way to one shot everything and make the game boring again. Don’t you worry your whining little head.
---
Near the back exit from Gauley mine, along the train tracks, there’s a broken mine cart or something and every time I go past that area there’s animals. It used to always be radstags, but then I guess something got updated, and since then I’ve seen squirrels, opossum, and a couple times it’s been cats.

---
No one is going to kill you with slap damage.
---
Yea after level 38 level advanatage falls off pretty hard (depending how you build). A level 45 isnt muck weaker than a level 200.
---
You're right. They didn't rebalance the game for multi-player, or balance it in the first place because you could become OP with only certain builds in the previous games anyway. But for some reason, that's part of the appeal to me. It plays just like FO4 and is just as customizeable. Granted, balancing needs to happen for fairness, but I think the copy/paste from FO4 worked with most of the game.

Twice a month, including consoles, isn’t fast enough? They had a small gap around the holidays, big deal.
---
Putting crafted items on par with legendary drops (or even surpassing them in some ways) would also lead to an ACTUAL economy. The mats for end game crafted items would become valuable trade goods for scavengers (economy) and crafters would either need to multitask to hunt their own mats (making time/effort a resource), pay scavengers for the mats (economy), or the buyer would need to provide the mats (time/effort as a resource).
---
You should try to leave it at the vault eentrance. I always put on my Chrimmy T51 and drop off all my lowbie stuff there. Try to do Leader of the Pack so I can help out some lowbies. I even try to leave something whenever I pass by a random camp haha
---
You can turn. You can jump. Have fun!
---
Who cares how you get wanted. I said you can just die once to get rid of wanted to play a public event normally and your response was:
---
&gt; But you make even **more caps from killing the people** trying to kill you. Way more than any event could give even if you account for the fact that eventually, yes, you will have to get that 10 cap bounty removed somehow. I can make upwards of 1k caps in about half an hour if I’m lucky by standing at vault 76 with a bounty and just killing everyone that tries to claim it.
---
You can’t have it both ways, dude. Are you trying to PvP in a public event or not?
---
The entire game is merely unfortunate.. Yet we still persiverre in hope 
---
Every time i go to nuke zone i hard crash in the first minute, pretty much ruins the endgame/goal of the game

Shit, shotguns are some of the worst, unless you are in their face or have a very specific build. Obviously pistols aren't going to be damage power houses. I think high rate of fire guns need cheaper ammo and slower condition reduction though.

Lol well that's one way to waste a hell of a lot of springs

I loved the sound of the pipe automatic rifle in Fallout 4. Sadly its damage didnt hold up end-game. I wonder if it would with the right perks in FO76.

It would work pretty well for any lady scalawags out there.

Im on console so hardrive issues are likely not the issue

Awww. Your dupes and over powered weapon are getting nerfed. Cry more.

I used to use them to power level block. Just a shield in one hand and a healing spell in the other.

Did you forget what you were replying to? This doesn’t follow at all from what we were talking about.
---
Don't do Herd if you are unarmed and playing solo, fractional stats negate any effect from berserker or evasive.
---
I never duped. I actually played the game.
---
I’ve got 5 now, all facing the direction all the mobs come from, with a couple spotlights to make the first turrets more than target practice. My budget is full, but I feel pretty good about my camp looks.
---
If we were same team, you wouldn't be getting any loot if I was killing everything before you could get to it.
---
If you want to argue for melee on something other than damage we can do that too. Melee does seem better for looting in tall grass. I guess I could always turn grass down or off if I wanted to. 
---
Ammo ceases to be an issue when you discover mining. The only thing I need to scavenge for now is acid and some cloth. There is one level 3 acid workshop about 13 caps north of vault 76. I like to take that every day. I use to go for Grafton Steel and the munitions factory when I didn't know what I was doing. The issues with people not knowing about how to get ammo is mainly ignorance. Before level 50 it can be tough, but afterwards with the combination of ammosmith, super duper, and the mining power armor, there is no issue.
---
You may not know this about full auto, but the cost in vats is reduced and a critical will land every shot 100% until your vats meter is empty. It's really strong and kills pretty much everything before vats is empty. Scorchbeasts the obvious exception. It also refills the critical meter after the first shot lands meaning I always have a critical stored. I think there is even a perk with a chance to refill vats when getting a kill. Seems like a strong combination.

Honestly, though-- healing factor mutation and Farma Pharma...
---
Glad you're sorted out. I have had issues that required a full power off (unplug or turn off surge suppressor) to fix. What a bother!
---
They are not removing the TSE combination from the loot tables. They specifically stated they will still be available. But even if they were removing them, it's still just a matter of removing a particular record from the loot table.
---
It's very easy to make these kinds of changes in the Creation Kit and it does not involve rewriting code. You don't know what you're talking about.
---
Haha, what woukd you be changing?
---
Like this idea!!
---
Maybe with the right effects on it, or the patience to deal with slightly longer fights. Maybe a crit build would work?
---
I'd pay actual dollars for that.
---
But nope, still accumulating Atoms because I don't want a pair of pajamas. 
---
Happened for me a few times on Xbox, not since the last patch though.
---
Its bad on high level stuff but i had a zealots lmg and went to charleston was a blast. Using it on lvl 5 enemies is how its meant to be used..unfortunetly
---
This was actually happening the night before the update.
---
REEEEEEEEEEE
---
In this situation, the guy was already dead.
---
We have no idea if the person that ate them killed them or not.
---
and I don't give two shits one way or the other.
---
Lol. C'mon dude. No way 
---
&gt; We will show you how bad this game is. 
---
That's why \*we\* first need to come here on Reddit and make an announcement. Roflcopter.
---
I got a tse 50 cal, shits cool but,not an mg42 ,cool
---
Wrong on 20 different levels! LOL
---
Nice idea 
---
You started making little smart ass comments so I thought that was where we were going???
---
Jumping with sent/ass armor is where you will hear the "you're hacking!!!!!!1!111!" People. Dont listen to them. Bethesda representation of enemy health bars in pvp are not at all accurate. My gf and I have tested this. I have all the perks for heavy guns. A 50 cal that can just shoot at a still target with stagger perks demolishes any sentinel pretty quick. On my screen it showed her taking dmg and quickly healing it back for about 2 seconds before she dropped. On her side, Dodgy was draining ap, she was taking minimal damage, and then she died when her AP was gone. Just thought I'd throw that in there since pvpers are called cheaters alot. Ask for better UI implements.
---
This is probably the most childish thing I've every read.
---
Sorry they didn't ask **your** permission before making a change to **their** game.
---
I was about to say all I’ve seen is videos and posts about people getting reported and banned for just being accused of duping 
---
I always try to make the ugliest most twisted face. Gimme dem dark souls options I wanna F U C K I T U P
---
Nah, more r/publicfreakout

When you have friends come over and that picture shows up on your loading screen...
---
&gt;Gun fu for melee
---
Holy shit snacks! That sounds like so much FUN!!! 
---
This is the entire reason I have no shelves in my house. It's an entire category in the build menu and it's utterly wasted. 
---
Oh I like this list.
---
I’m not one for PVP but with the Current state of it I’m surprised you had so many opportunities. Most of the PVP I see is Camps getting rekt by TSE, and that’s it
---
This is as bad an idea as the Cazador swarms suggested earlier.
---
Can you completely and accurately explain the entire timeline of Fallout and it's differences from our timeline?
---
I can't believe how many people bitch about scorchbeasts who don't how Enforcer perk works. Even with a stock non-legendary shotgun it will make a SB sit there on the ground and stare at you while you beat it to death.
---
Seems a little pathetic, but you do you.
---
Look, we are both playing the same game. We both have experiences and we both know what we see in game. But I'm not playing a melee character. My character is far more a crafter than a melee. And if anything I prefer ranged over melee. Hence, the grenades and such. 
---
My favorite weapon is the auto grenade launcher. It rips through armor. Has a chance to cripple. Nothing is easier to take out then some creature limping along. You think you are pinning me as melee player, but nothing could be farther from the truth. I'm a versatile person. it's so much better than and more interesting then trying to be that one shot kill guy. 
---
I'm 100% sure your experiences are true. The first laser weapon I got, broke quick. The Gamma gun was fun, but only really good against other players. But I didn't give up and automatically assume all energy weapons are bad, because some don't last that long. 
---
The Gatling Plasma I found is great against scorched beasts when they land. But that's the only time I use it. 
---
You built your a toon around specific weapons, with specific requirements needed. You built a toon around a narrow part of the game design, because you only cared about a narrow part of it. 
---
I built a toon around being good at certain things. Not the best. But certainly with the idea that I don't need to have the top ranked perk. I built a character that can be versatile in a variety of ways. 
---
Is that not it's meant to be you ask? Well, if you only play 20% of the game, I'd say no, that's not how it's meant to be. But you are welcome to only play a small part of the game. 
---
We should let them know the most rewarding events either spawn legendary enemies, rewards you with plans or at the least tops you off with aid items/chems. No one likes getting generic weapons/armor for a ten minute event
---
That's definitely something I'd like but only if the game was more stable, right now I occasionally get mobs that "glitch" and it would be frustrating to get 3-4 hit by an invisible mob haha
---
Is LotD useful? I mean, does it proc often enough to be worthwhile?
---
Different strokes I guess. The LMG looked janky to me. I love rocking my 50 cal vs queen. Pretty much the only time I use it since its prime. But what a fun 3-5 minutes that is.
---
Mostly, yeah.
---
I'm talking about the GAS MASK on the WRAPPED CAP
---
*Starts stopwatch*
---
...and go.
---
So many stupid people on this sub and you no exception. How do you suggest they capture video of it, all you going to see is some douche running off with your PA and there will be no proof it actually belonged to you, you really think at least two peoplel randomly just lie about having there PA stolen .. 
---
Its odd how many have the kneejerk reaction of shooting you when you stab them with a 3* bowie kinfe.
---
It kinda bit them on the ass though. I mean, if they addressed these in FO4, they would have gotten brownie points, "Look, we're supporting out game even years after release, and doing balancing even though it's single player." This way, they could then copy-paste stuff into the next game, and it's already balanced! See, it would have paid dividends, doing the work, properly, back then. But now? FO4 still has the bug. FO76 got the same bug. People complained about both. FO76 bug finally got fixed. FO4 continues to have the same bug (afaik?). Plus they provided undeniable proof that they literally copy-pasted stuff from FO4 into FO76, since the bug got copy-pasted also. Which gives credence to the notion that this entire game is just a FO4 mod, not a proper standalone title. And it certainly proves they tacked on multiplayer without giving balance any thought at all, when they have to nerf not one but TWO legendary traits, on the same weapon, by 150% in total (75%x2). When a nerf on a single item is 150%, it's no longer debatable, it means the balance was *atrocious*. 
---
All of this could have been completely prevented just by doing it properly in the first place, or patching it in the years that passed since then.
---
Yeah it was the only time I've had a "fair" fight. 
---
r/foundthemobiluser
---
It was actually the most fun ive had in 76
---
I agree with harder events. I’d also like to see some like the Battle Bot event where you need multiple people to trigger things simultaneously to complete in order to force us to work together (and yes I know that if you hit it right you can do Battle Bot alone, it was just an example).
---
I’d also like to see a way to text chat the server to help us coordinate events with strangers and people without mikes.
---
Is that a real thing? Because that sounds awesome.
---
I'm having this issue. Don't suppose you ended up getting a fix for it did you?
---
I also felt doing this so I understand.  
---
It will be nothing compared to the current melee builds.
---
They likely did a quick DB query and saw that they had lots of items with the same UID, that was it.
---
Oh yeah I did.
---
I agree, maybe it's fine for the very low level ones but there should be more like uranium fever or ones with better rewards
---
wow, you should really consider professional counseling if this is how you deal with the slightest frustration
---
seriously, you need help
---
Wtf that's a thing?! Bethesda you monster! ;-;
---
The lmg, or tickle duster as it's better known, is a heavy weapon intended to eat your useless .308 rounds later in the game, when the hunting rifle also becomes useless.  It serves the same purpose as the Alien Blaster (after conversion).  
---
It can be effectively used against strong enemies such as frogs, cats, squirrels, possums and beavers. 
---
The TSE version is highly effective against rad roaches.
---
So with all the bugs in this game, people reporting they losing weapons and gear fromt their stashes over night, things disppearing willy nilly and you don't at least have an open mind it is possible. You have no way if justifying that statement as much as I do, but at least I have an open mind that it is at least possible ..
---
Thanks Dr Phil!
---
Mad about the 2 shot nerf eh...
---
Bragging about picking on women won't get you far in the real world. Just a heads up, mate.
---
Text chat is so needed on PC atleast!
---
Can we get it from treasure maps?
---
“I ate his ass with some fava beans and a nice chianti.”
---
Where does Fallout 1 &amp; 2 fall in the timeline? I believe they were after 76, but not sure.  
---
Need an event duration bar added to icon on map for event showing how much time is left. It will drain according to the time remaining in the event so that you won’t waste your time traveling to the event when it’s pretty much over. 
---
You know you can save a post right?
---
My main reason for bulking is to resell to the vendor stations. They won't buy a pile of glass shards but if you put it in a plastic box...$$$
---
Text chat devolves super hard in the MMOs I've experienced. Maybe for clan guild and party only I'd back that.
---
Please tell me with the name Schrute Farms you have a bearskin rug somewhere on the property. 
---
Great idea!
---
i can say that in my personal experience, on PS4 also, it has been happened almost every time since the update, which has been about 7 or 8 times now. I've only been inside a nuke zone and left when I was ready ONCE without crashing so far. Just happened twice while typing this. Before the recent patch it did happen occasionally but never this often.
---
As an additional note, this is absolutely bananas that I can be in pacifist mode and be flagged for pvp by default. You have given griefers a direct line to trolling and harassing players. Especially if I have multiple workshops since my dot shows up on the map. These folks were literally just going around trolling people and racking up bounties and I was losing quite a bit of caps from their behavior. 
---
are you on ps4, please say yes, and include your psn 
---
Her REEEEing was the icing on my cake.
---
I like it. I might be tempted to move 2 points from int and put them on perception. Since youre critting with the pistol, it might as well be a head shot. Then again, it could be fun to keep int at 10 and pick up demolition 5 and throw molotovs. At least I assume demolitions affects molotovs. But yeah that loks fun!!
---
My bad dude. 
---
The best quests to me are: Leader of the Pack, Uranium Fever, Arms and Armaments, and then the horde events I guess. These are all spread out in level but really good in terms of reward
---
Stick a power connector on a wall behind it
---
Attach a wire to that
---
shhh shhhh, do not feed the animals
---
Attempting now
---
Make a conduit and it should light by itself no need for wire I believe 
---
Sameee
---
If you have a TSE, you bought a dupe.
---
1H + Shield + Heavy Armor was an extremely powerful build in Skyrim.
---
&gt;*Laser rifle breaks*
---
The only part of this post I changed relate to.
---
Well, kinda. Don't use laser weapons kids.
---
True, it would be nice for trade though
---
Not of the queen, but I’ve seen a video posted on here of TSE dragon one shotting the scorchbeast.
---
I imagine it would take a huge chunk out of the queen though.
---
Have more nuke or SBQ style events. That trigger for everybody. A named grafton monster attack, a special behemoth attack. Even simple stuff like endless ghouls overrunning whitespring for a little bit. Or scorchbeasts attacking the responders. Some more giant group style events 
---
I am! Its XxConsolePeasantxX
---
Haha, I will do just that. Can't wait to hear the trash they talk!
---
Remove the Protest March Event. It doesn't work half the time I join it. Also recently discovered I have to join a Horde event AND go into my pipboys Data to activate it. Thought they werent working at all.
---
I did this to the same guy! I got an angle from the front though. The "disgust" face is perfect.
---
Short barrel makes hip fire more accurate.
---
HELL YEAH IT WORKED
---
Agreed. 
---
Why is this one shit and the rest aren't? 
---
I actually really liked light with 1H and Shield. Infinite stamina for shield sprinting into stuff to knock them around.
---
And full dragonscale with a shield made me essentially invincible anyways. 
---
I can indeed verify it affects Molotov cocktails! My demo character loves hurling them at groups of enemies and watching them scatter for dear life. 
---
“It’s a me!”
---
And squirrels are really threatening?

WhiteSprings bunker has the Antibiotics, Radaway and Stimpacks recipe, mission takes about 1-2 hours to get you access to the terminals.  You will still need blood packs to craft them, so you still going to need supplies. Make sure you have Pharma Farma Level 3 perk ..
---
A very common tactic for cheaters who have action taken against them is to spew bullshit where ever they can to sow doubt and damage credibility in a feeble attempt to get the action reversed or negatively impact the perception of the company taking action or the action itself. Always approach such claims with skepticism, if it were true it would be far more blown up than it currently is. Especially in this sub, where tons of die hard fans reside.
---
Totally. Sold my fucking right arm lvl 50 3 star the other night too when the game lagged a bit when selling . 
---
That’s what I read at one point and it feels like it does when using it. But I’m not 100% sure on that one. 
---
All DR and stats is assuming you're naked.
---
Might be worth a read.
---
So the purpose of this build was to be able to have a character that would be effective both in and out of Power Armor. The SPECIAL distribution allows for different perks to be allocated to make each build viable. However, with the current state of the game, glitches between perk cards and stats do not allow for the unarmed build to gain DR/ER from Barbarian and Evasive when mutated with Herd Mentality or Egghead. I prefer to play the game with 2H weapons, however, because I want to maximize survivability when out of power armor we switch to Unarmed to offset(and even surpass) the damage of the 2H build. There is a little bit of play in the build when it comes to SPECIAL allocation(1 Point) and Perks. With that being said, let’s move on to discussing the build.
---
Strength – 15 – Required
---
2H Perks – Blocker(3), Incisor(3), Martial Artist(3), Slugger(3), Expert Slugger(2), Master Slugger(1).
---
Unarmed Perks – Blocker(3), Incisor(3), Martial Artist(3), Barbarian(3), Iron Fist(3).
---
There are your standard melee perks and I don’t recommend changing them up a whole lot. We take 3/2/1 in Slugger in order to maximize our damage % gained with each point allocation.
---
Perception – 1 – Recommended
---
I am honestly not a fan of any of the Perks in this tree when it comes to melee. I run with Fire In The Hole to make landing grenades easier. You can switch it to whatever you would like. Refractor would give a small boost to ER. You could choose Concentrated Fire to target limbs if you ever pull out a gun, however, I run melee only.
---
Endurance – 8 – Strongly Recommended For Unarmed Viability
---
2H Perks – Radicool/Rejuvenated(2) are required, the five remaining points are up to you, I suggest Solar Powered for the added damage and health during the day, you could also do Lifegiver for added health and Aqua Boy to fill the 1 extra spot. Lifegiver would make having lower % health builds easier to manage. You could swap these out for QoL perks. It’s up to you on how you would allocate them when using 2Hs.
---
Unarmed – Radicool, Rejuvenated(2), Ironclad(5) required.
---
Charisma – 7 Required
---
2H Perks (solo) – Lone Wanderer (4), Tenderizer (3), if you keep this at 8 feel free to allocate the last point wherever. Travel Agent is just a QoL Perk.
---
2H Perks (Grouped) – Tenderizer(3), Strange In Numbers(1), Required, 3 Points to play with, I suggest Team Medic or Body Guards. With good PA, Body Guards is less suggested.
---
Unarmed Perks (Solo) – Lone Wanderer (4), Tenderizer (3) required. Again, feel free to allocate the last point wherever or even move it out of this SPECIAL.
---
Unarmed Perks (Grouped) – Tenderizer(3), Strange In Numbers(1), Required, I suggest Body Guards(3 or 4) if you can fully benefit from its effects. This will make surviving Nukes wearing just a Hazmat Suit much easier. I’ll break the resistances down at the end of the guide to show how it all ties together. Also viable would be 2 points in Squad Maneuver considering we’re melee and the rest in Body Guards or another perk of your choice.
---
The reason we want 7 Charisma is that with Herd Mentality it’ll get bumped up to 9, allowing you to share a 3-star perk. With Class Freak the negative effects of Herd Mentality are completely negated. Taking Lone Wanderer allows us to skip perks like Action Boy in Agility because of diminishing returns. If you were to take LW and AB the difference between a full AP recharge would be less than a second, and definitely not worth 3 Points. That being said, if you are grouped up and drop Lone Wanderer, make sure to grab Action Boy to compensate. Tenderizer(3) is required because of it’s boost to our damage. Granted this would probably be overkill in most situations you could easily switch it out Suppressor if needed.
---
Intelligence – 3 – Recommended
---
2H/Unarmed – Makeshift Warrior (3). Small increase to the longevity of weapons. 3 points will allow us to repair our weapons to 200%. which is the main reason for the 3 points. You could also take Nerd Rage if you are into low HP builds. If you do decide to take Nerd Rage, look into Emergency Protocols for PA (MOD, Increases DR/ER at low HP). Honestly, this section is up to you.
---
Agility – 10 – Required
---
2H Perks (Solo) – Adrenaline (1), Required. 9 Points to spend. Adrenaline gets the most benefit with just 1 point invested, however, there aren’t a lot of AGI perks that work for melee, let alone while in Power Armor.
---
2H Perks (Grouped) – Adrenaline (1), Action Boy(3), Required. 6 Points to spend.
---
Unarmed Perks (Solo) – Adrenaline (1), Evasive (3), Required, White Knight (3) outside of Nuke Zones, inside possibly Marathoner + Moving Target,
---
Unarmed Perks (Grouped) – Adrenaline (1), Evasive (3), Action Boy(3)(B/C of Lone Wonderer), Required, I suggest White Knight(3) outside of Nukes, but you can swap it for Moving Target or Marathoner inside a Nuke.
---
The reason why we want 10 Agility is because of Evasive when using Unarmed. With Herd Mentality, it’ll bump to 12, and an additional 3 AGI from mutations (+4 Birdbones, but -1 from Talons (+3 Total)). This will bring us up to 13 Solo (39 DR/ER) and 15 grouped (45 DR/ER). Other than Adrenaline I’m not a fan of Agility for 2H/PA builds. Marathoner and a few other perks don’t work while in PA. I believe Deadmans Sprint works in PA. I don’t suggest adding the floating 1 SPECIAL point to this tree.
---
Luck – 11 – Required
---
2H Perks – Starched Genes(2), Class Freak(3), Bloody Mess(3) Required, 3 to play around with. Perhaps Luck Of The Draw for weapon longevity 1 or 3. Serendipity doesn’t work while in PA so avoid that.
---
Unarmed – Starched Genes(2), Class Freak(3), Bloody Mess(3), Junk Shield(3)
---
The main reason we want 11 is because of Unarmed. 8 Points are required to keep and maintain mutations as well as a multiplicative damage bonus from Bloody Mess.
---
This build will utilize all mutations except for Eagle Eye, Empath, Unstable Isotope, Carnivore/Herb (You may choose to do either though.)So how will the stat points look like for 2H or Unarmed? Solo or Grouped? If you have the points as 15/1/8/8/3/10/11 it’ll look something like this:
---
2H SPECIAL SOLO (22/1/11/8/8/13/11) *Optimal

It was brought up as a possibility in some of the groups.  For those unaware some dupers have been banned, most were not effected (even ones still playing, selling, and with massive inventories).  Some of the ban targets are truly look odd. For example some of the reddit users that claimed innocence had a history of only buying/selling a small amount of middle of the road gear.  It seams unlikely someone that dupes would be trying to sell  a couple 1-2 star weapons for a 100 caps when they could drink nukas.
---
Well this is their first one sooooo yeah
---
Tidying Up! With Marie Kondo dropped on New Years day on Netflix and it honestly changed our lives. By episode 3 i was hauling furniture to storage and by episode 5 our living room was completely cleaned out. It almost directly applies to Fallout 76 item stashes as well 
---
I second this. Otherwise OP is just a total coward. Give everybody your ign or simply pick up your ball and go home.
---
I have an explosive lever action. 5 ranks in explosive perks. Does this mean I will get 120 pct damage boost instead of 200 pct?? Guess I'm confused on what this actually means.
---
&gt;If you *have* a TSE, you *bought* a dupe.
---
Really?
---
So the TSE Gatling Gun that a 3* glowing Mirelurk dropped on my friend's back porch is duped?
---
For fucks sake, dupers are bad, but you people are psychotic.
---
Glen Cranmire. 
---
That was just the tip of the iceberg. Im going full time now.
---
I’ve literally crashed 3 times in the last 5 minutes. This latest update isn’t stable. 
---
This needs to be fixed Bethesda. 
---
&gt;two shot lever action
---
I'm an old lady, casual gamer and I got that same weapon as a drop. Gave it to a friend for free (not the OP, I'm on XB1), as she had mentioned specifically wanting a nice lever action rifle. The two shot was just a fun bonus.
---
lol I somehow doubt this, but I'ma look up gabengirlgamer now cause I want to get to know you better.
---
Frankly when and if this game comes out of it's current super early beta state, it should be a complete-roll back of the entire game. 
---
I've picked up 2 tse myself.  Send 3 or 4 of each just 2 shot or explosive.
---
Say what?? Thanks for telling me! But also yes, more immersion in camp building 
---
Enjoy you fake cake!
---
Please do
---
Absolutely. You're still going to get spammed with sonic attack so wear PA .
---
Combine it with concentrated fire to cripple a wing. Hits without concentrated fire still have a chance to hit a wing, but you'll burn ammo and will take a lot longer.
---
Once it's on the ground, dump another magazine into the head. Head hits with Enforcer stun it, and it will just sit there a grunt and snort. 
---
When it's just sitting there, dump lead into it to kill it or just switch to melee and beat it to death.
---
It does wear off, so kill it fast or you'll have to rinse and repeat to get it on the ground again.
---
Enjoy mate
---
Works like that for all lights
---
You can also use a thing in advanced power connectors, I think it was called a regulator(?)
---
Yellow circle thing that lights up. Spooges light power in a larger area than connectors afaik. Also lights up itself
---
This cakes *not* a lie.
---
Maybe you'd be better off enjoying single player games. You don't seem to have the emotional maturity to deal well with others.
---
Touche.
---
hehehe i wish you could drag bodies you kill.
---
The positive spin is that you get to keep talking when you get the "disconnected from server" or "garbled audio game crash" events.
---
Yea its not well known yet. Keep it clean and disease free, gang!
---
Not a great excuse. Many 1st time MMOs have been a huge success.
---
The full explosive damage is applied to every projectile instead of split between them, kinda like amp shields and shotguns in bl2 pre nerf
---
Dang bro that sucks, I feel for ya
---
US vs China... Bombs fell... People hid... Things mutated... People stopped hiding... Discovered life's mysteries...
---
I disagree
---
Better rewards for events would be great - a higher chance of plans and guaranteed legendaries would actually make you want to do them.
---
Also making "The Messenger" escort event either a shorter distance or make the robot go faster, that would be appreciated.
---
Maybe more events on at the same time and at least one in each region. I don't like server hopping to get events that I want.
---
Bugs in events need to be sorted as well. Sometimes the Messengers navigation goes awry, Breach and load sometimes forgets to give any ore whatsoever and sometimes the horde events don't properly trigger.
---
For events like Uranium fever, it'd be good if all players participating could access the legendaries so they don't miss out if another player single handedly kills it. Maybe make all event enemies killed lootable but XP is only for those who deal sufficient damage.
---
I'm in the same boat, except I blame this place for the nerf. like it or not, r/fo76 is one of the biggest Fallout 76 communities, which says a lot about the current state of the game. regardless, Bethesda **does** listen to its moaning.
---
you kinda ruined the game for me, so I'll make a point to ruin it for others. I've been leveling bases with a two-shot fatman and generally picking on weaker players.
---
and you know what the best part is? the only thing that kept me in check, TSEs, are getting banned. so good going.
---
I always see them fighting Yao Guai, usually there is a dead baby sloth nearby :( 
---
Nope. It is not region locked.
---
+25% for twoshot and +20% for explosive, that's 45%.
---
On what basis do you believe it is based on weight?  In fallout 4 it was determined to be calculated by flat values per mod that didn't necessarily correlate to weight.
---
^
---
Are you a Melee build? I would love to take some of that steel from you! I go thru 5.56 ammo like popcorn! :D
---
Nobody cares about your opinion. Go away.
---
Why on earth do they bother selling the other versions at different prices, lol
---
I know the game is ass and broken but I'm...intrigued
---
If you're asking if someone would go on to the internet and lie for whatever reason, then my answer is yes.
---
Always three star legendaries or higher.
---
Nah ESO was the parent company's first one, and they actually tried to avoid the main complaint of it not feeling like an Elder Scrolls game. So thank ESO for this not having abilities on cool down
---
oooh tyvm did not know this and I do in fact use Berserker 
---
It may not be a good excuse but it is the truth. They have only ever made single player games, dont expect them to be professionals at mmo's ones. That's like having someone drive an automatic car for 30 years and then suddenly expect them to be proficient at driving manual from doing nothing but watching youtube videos. It's their first time give them a break, they are learning and improving 
---
I'm more pissed about the Vampire and XP nerfs. I can understand your reaction, I'm tempted to do something siimilar, but when I think about it, it just takes too much energy. The sad part is whatever is the next thing that is too fun or too OP, they'll just nerf those too. Rather than add in end game content, they would rather make everyone slog through a tedious grind. 
---
Very informative! I was operating under the assumption that if bulking didn't reduce weight, it would at least not add to it. Now I know what to bulk and what not! Thank you!
---
I mean, this isn't an MMO. Lacks the "massive" component and world persistence. More akin to a shared world RPG or a lobby based RPG. Quite frankly, while I'm unhappy about the lack of content coming into the game, I'd say they're making a lot of the right moves with things like banning dupers/exploiters, nerfing legendary affixes that are insanely and clearly overpowered and outclassing literally everything, and working on addressing issues the community has been complaining about for some time. Sure not everybody is going to agree, but that's the nature of life.
---
that's what it seems like
---
better call the wahmbulance
---
I think if there's going to be a centralized player hub, it will end up being the Whitespring.
---
- There's already a bunch of shops.
---
- There's already a crafting area nearby.
---
- The [Enclave bunker](/spoiler) is right there.
---
- It's centrally(ish) located.
---
And, most significantly
---
- There are a ton of rooms and cottages with doors that are set up to be interactable, but don't actually do anything yet.
---
Trust me, everyone has had a FML moment where you drop, stash or sell something that you wanted to keep. You just cry and move on, lol.
---
I would rather see roughed up dirty stuff that would look at home in the wasteland
---
I have 15 fusion cores...and making my gf hold another 6 for me in her stash. It might be intervention time
---
yeah, that's totally true
---
That's doubtful but the appeals exist for a reason. Ban waves aren't 100% perfect. Having said that, it's like prison where everyone says they're innocent. The guilty seldom take responsibility and will push any narrative to sell someone on their innocence. A vast majority of banned players have nothing to gain by telling you the truth. They believe if they cause enough fuss and deny their culpability long enough they can get their accounts back. I've seen several of these "innocent" reports only to check their post history and see evidence to suggest otherwise...
---
Lol. Its factual. Not an opinion that this has happened. You may like the game but that doesn't change the FACT that is has been one PR incident after another. You go away kid.
---
Personally I’m waiting for the repellent stick to make a comeback.
---
Oh God I cannot let my wife see that show
---
This is the best thing I've seen come out of this game.
---
I need one to stop level one Scortched from constantly breaking my walls and fusion generator every time I'm out. Seeing it take such a huge chunk of my budget is saddening.  It's cheap to repair, just annoying
---
u gotta post pics now
---
Holy crap it worked, I deleted a floor where I had turrets disappear for no apparent reason and it popped two turrets into my stored tab immediately.  Scrapped one and replaced the missing one, now I have more free budget to play with!  Thank you for the find!
---
Bethesda had nothing to do with ESO except for giving zenimax their assets to make it
---
Also- Good With Salt perk works on raw flux because flux is in the aid menu- makes it last much longer before it decays to give you more time to get from the nuke zone to a chemistry bench to turn it into stable flux.
---
I can craft full sets of everything but raider, have never found any raider piece plans only mods.  45, 51, and 60 all came from maps, 60 and 51 in the bog and 45 and 51 pretty much everywhere else except the forest
---
Tastes like chicken.
---
I didnt say I hate them for it. I just said the truth.
---
So I made a post about slap damage not working.  I was one shotted (melee) by a guy after he blew up my camp and I was also two shotted with a TSE by another guy, both times I was in pacifist and didn't shoot them.  After some other peoples posts I started to wonder if I had taken a workshop that day and maybe this was the issue.  But in both cases they showed non hostile then when they fired on my camp they went red and wanted.   I'm assuming PvP shouldn't have been in effect in either case, correct, since shooting my base gave them a bounty?
---
\*scribbles furiously in notebook\*
---
I will now 360 spin.
---
Every. Single. Time.
---
Thank you for your game play tip! :)
---
I got mine from Uranium Fever event.
---
You can get them pretty cheap at Enclave bunker.
---
Radroaches are kinda cute
---
Your absolutely welcome. I’m glad it’s helping. 
---
Oh, no no. That was meant to be like an actual sales pitch. It’s cheesy but so am I. I do mean what I said. Two shot is still one of the best legendary mods.
---
More so with single fire. It has a chance to proc each time you pull the trigger. So if you pull the trigger of an automatic 1 time and unload the whole thing that will be 1 chance to proc. If you use auto and instead burst fire your shots then it will proc more often. 
---
Ok so you asked for more?  I posted more.  The forest/urban gas mask can't be worn with a hat.
---
Now that irks me because the regular gas mask can.
---
You said... no it can't.  But it can.  Then said what you were talking about.  Which is not what I was talking about.
---
&gt; Feel free to add more.
---
Don't know why I bothered...
---
Mole rats always break my Decon shower first thing they target every time lol
---
How original. You come up with that one yourself? 
---
That is very good info to have, thanks!
---
Little introduction would be:
---
Fallout is a universe that split from ours shortly after WW2 in an event called “The Great Divergence“. It developed differently which is why the Fallout universe is retro-futuristic: Its culture has apparently been stuck in the 50s and technology, although advanced, is still bulky aand computers look, well, like they do. During this time all over the world countries have drained the planet of its resources which led to the respurce wars that were started by the European commonwealth who attacked the Middle East in an attempt to get their oil. China then invaded Alaska. America was obviously not pleased by this, annexed Canada and sent soldiers to Anchorage. During “Operation Anchorage“ America, with the help of their power armor, was able to catch the Chinese off guard and defeated them. A year later on 10.23.2077 the bombs dropped. No one is sure who dropped first. Shortly before that Roger Maxson, a military service man, found out what happened at Mariposa, a facility designed to create mutants (super-mutants) with an experimental virus called FEV, and then seceded from the US Army, founded the Brotherhood of Steel and isolated himself in the Lost Hills bunker in California.
---
I mean why even have XP gains or Loot? Just take them out of the game all together. 
---
How would it work if when you log in, it puts you in a different server every time..?
---
Ummm....my bad I guess?
---
Nice! Plus, now that nuke zones last four hours (or so I hear), that'll be even more handy/necessary.
---
Yo you still have calibrated shocks? I will pay big money.
---
Do you mean like on one piece of armor or do you mean like one piece of armor with another?
---
Is it really so hard just to enjoy the game?
---
I love Fallout for being Fallout. 
---
There are 5,000 people online. It can take time to sort through posts.
---
Yep. Some people want all weapons to be buffed to (current) TSE levels. Which is redicous. It's bad enough TSE is so high powered and been duped to bollocks. We need less of that, not more!
---
They want scorched beasts nerfed. The one creature that's tough to fight.
---
I'll do it as soon as I figure out how. I'm on Xbox
---
I am (level 3) but that has no impact on the stats weight of junk (just tested it with and without perk enabled).
---
Yes I agree that it's not really an MMO but it is a multiplayer online game. They are making the right choice by fixing issues and balancing the game before releasing new content, that's the best move for them right now. Adding more cannons to a ship wont do any good if its sinking from a bunch of holes
---
i would be happy if Turrets could just stop ignoring the rad rats that destroy my crops..or worse..the turrets themselves. As it stands now..I believe rad rats hit box is under the ground for the turrets..and they just cant see them. Cant tell you how many times ive gone AFK at my camp just to come back and hear the tiny sound of rats attacking my crops..and the turrets simply doing nothing.  
---
Also...if crops could lose their bullet stopping abilities..that would be great. The radrat standing inside my Razorgrain..I cant kill them unless i use explosive..since the plant is the best bullet stop this side of the Rockies 
---
I heard they show up to your home and break your legs
---
Holy shitballs, if that's true it's the best damage perk in the game by a fairly large margin for any gun with a rate of fire higher than like...10.
---
It feels nothing like a fallout game though. 
---
I'm pretty sure that's not how TS works
---
That doesn't seem so bad at all. With the damage they are doing, it'll still kill most things easily.
---
Jokes on them I been in a wheelchair for the last 4 years 😂
---
OH FUCK I DIDN'T EVEN THINK OF GOD/DOG holy shit
---
Its the most fun the game has given me.
---
There's that one rooftop with a bar that one of the quests sends you to... I often find a sneaky 3 star protectron up there. 
---
Fallout 1 takes place in 2061 and Fallout 2 a couple years after that. Fallout 76 is the earliest Fallout game to date.
---
What button do?
---
True. However, melee is in a much better position to 1-shot than ranged, factoring in reloading and body-blocking of shots. One of the problems in farming Whitesprings for example is that you really can't reach many enemies, especially in VATS, because there's half a dozen melees between you and the enemies. You're also kinda moving the goal posts. We just went from PvE to PvP (competing for the same kills). 
---
Ammo does not cease to be an issue, ever. Mining takes time. Time is money. Ergo, ammo is money. If you need to scavenge anything at all to feed the guns, it's inferior to melee, period. And depending on gun type, ammo is quite an issue, where you need a dedicated PA set (Excavator) just to farm ore to turn it into metal to craft the ammo, for which you need 5 levels worth of perks (Ammosmith and Super Duper). Not to mention with certain guns you REALLY need the weight reduction perks - such as explosive heavies requiring Ordinance Express, or Gatling Lazer requiring Batteries Included. With melee, weight management if baked into ROF perk, Martial Artist. This duality, on top of melee damage scaling with Strength (which no guns do with Perception, Agility or Intelligence) is another reason melee is superior.
---
And as far as VATS critical goes, melee doesn't need to spend any points on that. Not really. Non-power attacks still 1-shot almost anything without the need to rely on VATS or crits. Which frees up a lot of perks for quality of life improvements. Which is already significantly higher, due to no need to farm for ammo, and far cheaper and easier to obtain weapon repair materials.
---
Melee is just better in this game, on too many fronts. If Perception begins to affect rifle damage? That would be something. But we would still need equivalents of alcohol, or food which directly (+10% melee damage) or indirectly (+3 Strength) increase melee damage, for which there's no ranged equivalent. Not to mention as unarmed you get to double-dip into two mutations for 25% each, when again there's no equivalent for ranged. Though I will concede that at least in PvP the melee is hampered by Blocker, and there's no anti-ranged equivalent of it.
---
GT is MrEMar
---
I haven't played it in a while but I had to stop cause I spent quiet a while on it and didn't get very good rewards like I use to. More importantly it wasn't as fun. Also the difficulty seemed to get increased
---
I also think that they could add a ton of interest to the game if they added unique and worthwhile enemy spawns to each location on the map for when the location is nuked. Everyone nukes whitesprings or prime because they are the only targets with any value or interest. I think a nuked site should scale up legendary spawn rates for any given area, the enemies that spawn in any given nuke site should render more XP and be UNIQUE to that specific area, location specific “boss” to fight as a group and it drops special items that are unique to it. The goal would be to add excitement server wide for anywhere someone decides to drop a nuke and to really reward the process. It would add a lot of depth to the game.
---
You’re right, you’re right. 
---
You can - I have a non-PA stealth build. I open up with a non-silenced explosive gun. If it doesn't one shot them I pacify them and finish them off. 
---
Interesting question but I think this is beyond my knowledge.
---
oh shit my bad. I misinterpreted what you were originally posting. I thought you said the Wrapped Cap could be combed with the Urban masks. My mistake
---
Yup.  That would be the best solution is something like sim settlements from 4 where you have multiple budgets for different areas.  Then they can keep people from making mobile gun platforms while still allowing people to have a nice base and defend it.
---
Multiple pieces! If there is any benefit to 5x powered AP Regen with lonesome wanderer! Or 75% Max Dmg reduction with 5x cavalier?
---
Did everyone just forget about Col Gutsy? Whenever I see one I would rather just run away and perforate myself with a flaming, barbed ice pick.
---
If you play the Australian copy in America, everything is upside down and all the mobs say "oi mate!"
---
also - pacifying drops \[caution\] and \[danger\] and changes it to \[detected\] - if that is the creature that senses you
---
One button shoot
---
One button aim
---
One button speak
---
Understand?
---
You're missing a shit ton of information. Like the resources wars, the EU being disbanded, limited nuclear exchange in the middle East, China's invasion of Anchorage Alaska, the annexation of Canada, ext.
---
Ill be on tomorrow i have a few thousand you can have for free if you want
---
You and your downvoting goons can go finger yourselves.  I'm going to blow up your camp too lol
---
Sturdy frame. Endgame for me is all about collecting legendary armor (at least until they nerd my weapons), and it can take quite a while to find a complete set full of legendary mods you want on the right pieces. You have to hold onto a lot of pieces of armor until you are sure they all go together. This perk saves me like 40 pounds. 
---
The PR is coming from an overly entitled population trained that the loudest victim gets the internet points.  At this point I'm sure every player has experienced crashes or a glitch.  Plenty are able to move past it and just enjoy the game.  Others need to blog about everything and rely on upvotes and likes to validate their existence.   The problem is when those people try to tell other people that they're not enjoying something that they are.  But we can all appreciate you reposting the same regurgitated crap with absolutely nothing new contributed to the discussion.
---
Join me komrade!
---
I know, it's a personal thing.
---
I can't decide which version of the story i don't quite believe.
---
They require you to take out the railroad and the BOS. It’s not much, but their line of quests I somehow enjoyed the most. Probably because nobody is yelling at me to get something done, if I recall correctly...
---
You're a hero.   I can't stand the community on this reddit lol.  They are constantly complaining about the core game mechanics.    Lets go to the monopoly reddit and ask them to change the rules so its co-op instead of pvp only monopoly :)
---
I'm Immortal!
---
You can keep changing your appearance in-game. I've had a lot of trouble around the mouth/chin area.
---
Elder Scrolls Online charges like $7 for each edit.
---
Would recommend watching Oxhorn's videos on YouTube. Well known and trusted.
---
Well I am a gun nut, and this made no sense to me either. If they wanted to balance it out they should have made the .50 more powerful but loaded a bit slower than the .308. I ditched my .308 and primarily use my lever action anyways for sniping. 
---
Very true, I am trying my best to creep along, only playing here and there.
---
Had another one last night.  Walked into Ellie's bunker, and went from full health to zero health instantly, but my armor applied a stimpack.  I'm like okay, maybe toxic in here.  Quick switch to hazmat suit, and then died.  I stayed on the death screen for a minute to find two people come out of stealth and continue hitting me.  Level 115 and level 79.  I'm like really, you find joy in killing a level 39 character for no reason.  Checked and I was in pacifist mode.
---
I will not play again, until they fix this.  I reported and sent video to Bethesda since they deny it can happen, not like they are going to do anything about it.
---
So what? I've played many MMOs in the past and many of them were hundred times worse at release.  
---
Just to mention a few examples:   
---
\- Queues  
---
\- VIP system
---
\- P2W microtransaction
---
\- Unstable servers (worse than Fo76)
---
\- Bots / bots taking all mobs from you so you can't progress.  
---
\- etc. etc.
---
If you have it already look at your stats before and after taking off classfreak. Should boost your resistances by 120 each if you can still cap both with the-2.
---
there's already a 50 cal handgun, use that if you're desperate 
---
Ah ok yeah I don’t think they stack bc to be right to the point that would be too overpowering but I could be very wrong I mean TSE were a thing for a long time 
---
Why do we have to spend so much time trying to find a vendor with caps. This part of the game feels like punishment. Please make vendors independent and refresh them hourly. I spent six hours traveling from vendor and serving hoping this morning trying to find ANY vendor with caps and I couldn't. I'm !v70.
---
he's a day 1 baddie, but also on the other coast.
---
our favorite green hunk of man is a completely different strain of super mutant in any case, so it *may* not be possible to make him into a nightkin anyway
---
I’m just tried researching and couldn’t find anything definitive but leaning towards it not stacking. It’s still a great 1 rank additional 5% damage to all enemies even for solo players
---
None of that made any sense till the last line.  What a dumb way to do damage
---
Yeah somethings not right with the servers
---
Well, think of it as the balancing maybe, a full stock on a shotgun is easier to cradle cary than a pistol grip in my experienc, and the 'cradle cary' is a 'ready state' cary, all you do is lift, shoulder it and boom.
---
Honestly though, equipment in general needs alot of work/balancing at the moment, but odds are, with the 'pvp' focus servers coming, the pvpve servers will likely be less pvp focused and that stuff will likely change, as it seems alot of those 'design decisions' were all about trying to shoe horn balance pvp, when the vast majority of folks in the comunity (in my experienct) want to play this as more of a PVE than a pvpve type game
---
How is that not a sub (an NSFW one, albeit, but still)
---
Nice!
---
Some games make me feel like a complete monster. I remember playing Metal Gear Solid 5, where you find D-Dog as a puppy. And he's so happy, running around, and I walk up to him and a hand-looking icon prompt appears. And I figure "Oh, neat, I can pet the puppy!" and press it. Instead of patting it, Snake just backhands the shit out of the puppy, with *his metal robotic hand!* Knocked the puppy right out. And I never liked Hideo Kojima since. 
---
The divergence is a continuous process that reached its peak shortly after WW2. Some small things happened before WW2 but nothing that changes history dramatically.
---
Hey you aren't doing anything wrong at all! That's the game mechanics Bethseda implemented so that's obviously the way they want us to play. 
---
They obviously wanted people in pacifist mode to either be 1 shot, or die a slow death by a thousand cuts or they would have just made you invulnerable while in pacifist mode.
---
I don't feel like giving more examples but there are a ton you can fill in for yourselves. 
---
I think you are just playing the game exactly how Bethseda intended so IMO carry on and have a good dam time. 
---
Hard to enjoy a game when you cant stay in a server long enough to take advantage of the workshops, kill the endgame boss, or even launch a nuke half the time. It's a legitimate complaint, you're just one of Bethesda's little white knites who try to justify all their screw ups and cant admit that they make mistakes... like leaking everyone's personal info for example. Not gonna reply to you any further because you aren't worth the time.
---
I've been wondering whats up with the Mutants in WV and from what I've gathered they were &gt;!doing FEV experiments there as well before the bombs dropped. Without exploring West-Tek in 76 I was unsure about the presence of them at all. !&lt;
---
Playing since beta
---
Never lost anything from inventory or stash.
---
Tried the PA stealing, tried the trade window stealing and was unsuccessful.  
---
Yes this game got bugs, but these issues i think it just people dropping their gear or selling it and not paying attention.  Ive done it myself.  
---
Then i think they post here in hoping someone white knights them some gear.  Its happen before.  
---
Aftet the patch ive been getting "double" loading screens 
---
Pass on that and egghead until its patched. With class freak there is no negative stats to EH otherwise. Also check out f076 bazaar for cheaper serums.
---
That update has not rolled out yet... quite making up shit.
---
No, that would be too fun!
---
Bingo right on man.
---
That's not a bad thought, but personally I'm fine with the current change on it, an alternate change I wouldn't mind is that the gun actually shoots a two round instaburst, so you ahve to reload more often/use ammo faster but get higher damage per trigger pull/cycle of the gun
---
Yes. Instead of killing every regular enemy with one shot, it will take two or three. It won’t be that bad at all. In fact, I‘m 100% sure it will improve my coop experience. Right now, when I’m playing with my friend, one of us always has to stay back and wait till the other tapped an enemy. Then the other would kill it with one shot. Now, we both can just fire 1-2 shots, will both get xp and the enemy will be dead in a second as well. No big deal. 
---
I wouldn’t consider myself a filthy casual but what’s the cannon ending to New Vegas? Always been interested in what the lore ending is.  
---
The arguement that other people made bad MMOs too doesn't help Bethesda's case.
---
LMAO, I totally did this last night.  Just smashed some SMs, turn around.... ooh look another one!  Pop Pop... oh crap... sorry Grahm!
---
Don't.  Worst thing I have done this year.  All I hear now is you dont need that, and this, and that.  After about the 15th thing, I said, I don't need you either, but I keep you around.  She shut up at that point, but still throws them out every once in a while.
---
Id like to know this as well. I think there is a possibility at this point that they may not nerf the weapons or at least not as much. Its causing a lot of backlash.
---
They didn't have anything to do with it directly but they were lore consultants and also published the title... But also they were able to see fan reactions to their IP being a relatively generic MMO. This is what I really meant by my comment. They were able to take into account on what NOT to do
---
They could nerf corn soup because reasons.
---
Everything in my characters surrounding are actually normal,he just took some bad acid. lol 
---
the stronger the gun, the thiccer it gets?
---
I think it's more frustrating to be one hit by a melee weapon.
---
Take a deep breath and ask yourself "Am I being over dramatic to illustrate a point?"
---
I can do it pretty regularly without a TSE using a commando build with luck maxed at 15. I'll lose 1k bullets doing it but I can. 
---
More important: better incentivization of it. Right now, it's one of the better group participation events in the game but it's always anticlimactic when the loot sucks. 
---
Hell just nerf soups in general. Having a food that restores both thirst and hunger that's absurd!
---
This is how immature this community is.  
---
"I dont have TSE afte THIRTY WHOLE HOURS! ALLTSE ARE DUPED!"
---
Fallout 76 takes place in October 2102. Fallout 1 is 2161, Fallout 2 is 2241. Fallout 3, the prologue is 2258, and the game proper begins in 2277. Fallout: New Vegas is 2281. Fallout 4 is 2287. Van Buren, the cancelled sequel of sorts to Fallout 2, was supposed to be set in 2253. 
---
They need an version that takes place before the fallout. Missions to China and stuff like that.
---
That's up to debate. No one knows because it has never been clarified. However most people assume it's the NCR ending.
---
This is one of the things I can't really wait for. It's the first thing I look for when Bethesda announces a new patch, and I'm constantly let down.
---
Find a gf who can carry more cores?
---
Resellers sell the games as different versions in an attempt to drive sales to a version in the buyers country. Preying upon the naive
---
Do TSE's fall under class C ATF rules?  Presumably those bastards didn't make it through the Great War (hopefully).
---
I am just saying that MMOs almost always come in crappy state at release and get better with time (not that i agree with this, its just what happens though and again most of the times).
---
Probably. I'm a mobile user and capitalized subreddits don't show properly. 
---
Most phones will auto capitalize the r and cause issues. 
---
Yeah, and they can nerf steel too!
---
What about fallout tactics?
---
Its a blast!
---
Im just using the tools given to me by bethsoft!
---
Gimme the tools for a 5k melee build then
---
Not really because they also want to make enemies more challenging. Even if you use an OP melee build you have to wait for the Scorchbeasts to land now
---
Not happy with the changes either.  Wish they could just put on limits or scaling damages to PvP to fix the issue for the 1-2% of the community that cares about PvP without effecting the rest of us.
---
With all the bans over the last 36 hours. Duping isn't a problem anymore. Servers are still shit might be slightly better over last two weeks
---
I see your Repellent Stick, and I raise you the [stomp from Dead Space.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4WsJ-FUhQQ) That, but in power armor. With Bloody Mess. Can you dig it?
---
This is amazing 
---
Indeed. Even when I'm solo I make a note of the other people's names during the fight so I can rejoin then when I disconnect
---
WTH is wrong with this subbreddit? Are you guys trying to slowly turn this game into Fallout 4? Are you guys forgetting that this is a multiplayer game and not a traditional Fallout game? Do we not take the time to realize that perhaps decisions made could be for game balancing purposes?
---
OP is complaining about the weight of mods increasing the weight of a weapon, more than it should, and doesn't realize that OP is trying to figure out the situation using logic even after OP mentions that something in the game, like a perk card, can reduce the size of a weapon! AND refuses to use it because OP doesn't want to mess with a build... AND people agree with OP lol The fact that you can change your receiver to effect the damage of a gun while using the same type of ammunition, doesn't seem trigger the logic part of the brain.
---
Now here's a complaint about hunting rifles weighing as much as a missile launcher. You noticed that there's no weight reduction cards for small weapons but there is for everything else? That's because small weapons are considered the jack of all trade weapons. They can be used for any situation. They also have the hidden benefits of allowing you to attack enemies from a distance and from spots that prevent the enemies from retaliating. The reason behind the weight distribution is to give more incentive to use other weapons other than small guns, which is currently doing a very good job. 
---
Again, this is not a single-player Fallout game where you play by yourself and achieve the status of overpowered. This is a multiplayer game that adds class variety to differentiate people, real people, and introduces game elements that focus on balance which provide strategy and increases a game's longevity, which opens the doors to endgame content. Welcome to **Fallout 76**.
---
Good point.
---
Leather and wood armour only too? Heh
---
Whitesprings is still good as is West Tek 
---
I apologise.
---
My argument is simply that I have a quad explosive radium rifle and it's not OP at all. 
---
Can I play without it? Sure I played for 75 levels before it dropped.
---
Is taking on a dozen level 68 super mutants more fun with it? Absolutely.
---
I'm all for a detachment of two shot from explosive but I don't think they need to each be nerfed individually. I've spent 2 weeks trying to accumulate mods for my radium and they are impossible to find and now my gun is taking a massive Nerf........ it's bullshit!
---
Under dispute / undetermined, because AFAIK Bethesda has not really acknowledged any aspects of that game's lore in FO4 or FO76. Long thread about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/6c3dr3/what_is_the_canon_ending_to_new_vegas/).
---
I know, and it sucks. Wish we could at least combine cores. On a side note, i just realized i have 68 plasma cores in my inventory. Why do we have a type of core that can only be used on 1 type of weapon? How did i get so many anyways 
---
Guns shouldn't of been able to do the damage that TSE was allowing them to do. Perks and everything excluded. It was truly absurd. This is a great thing and the community will adapt, and if it really isn't able to, Im sure they will rebalance further.  
---
This was clearly the **needed** rebalance, but I'm positive many more to come including all the hate for melee builds, and to make things like pistols and energy weapons useful.
---
Hell just quadruple the repair/build costs. Make the endgame even longer
---
I think we can all agree that [Gunther](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z13qnzUQwuI) is the way to go here.
---
look at what you typed 
---
I didn't see a mod for this. I've seen modded stations but nothing custom.
---
Crit vats hits with a normal gun will bring them down pretty quick.
---
This is bullshit I keep getting nuked in an area that regularly gets nuked!!!
---
I doubt they will end up creating whole new maps, dungeons most likely. But if anything I think they would take us back to DC, or to the Pitt, or a new location.
---
Going to California would not fit in with this game at all.
---
In my view, if you’re able to kill five bloated glowing ones in 1-2 shots, kill a deathclaw 30 levels above you in 1-2 shots, and kill a mirelurk queen in 4 shots, you have a weapon that needs to be balanced.
---
Those are all supposed to be boss level enemies and I can cut through them like butter. If you buffed every item in the game to that level, the game would be too easy.
---
It keeps you in the gameplay loop. You need to continually scavenge for materials. If they gave us unlimited stash space for raw scrap, you'd amass a huge stockpile and rarely need to look for specific things.
---
I mean, that's what I want, but I can see why they might justify it to keep people interacting with the world more.
---
As it is, I keep a very minor stash of basic things like steel but hoard the rare materials as much as possible. So when I need to build or fix something, I only have to go scavenging for common mats. 
---
Ah shit, I missed the e in mobile. 
---
Seriously though, how does one not know their, there, and they're are different words?
---
I agree its a bit overkill. Totally ruined my hype to play as well. Its not a great feeling knowing that after this weeked all my two shots will be 75% weaker. 
---
THATS WHERE THE GENERATOR PLANS ARE? Shit
---
Nah, TSEs were far too dominant. Nothing else came even close, both in raw damage and AoE. This nerf will open up a lot more builds, where previously it was TSE+Demolitionist.
---
I have noticed they do go a little heavy on the tape.  But then again your using stuff put together with scrap.  Could be worse it could be bubble gum lol.
---
Leave it that way very funny
---
I think they mean locked toolboxes and safes in player claimed workshop areas, not buildable objects like stashes.
---
I find Green Thumb more useful than just in a blast zone to pick plants.
---
Without it, I wouldn't have 31 Radshields (also thanks to Super Duper). 
---
Woodchucker is great if your into camp building. Double the wood! Same for the Perk that lowers the cost of resources used for camp building. 
---
Chemist is great too. Double stimpacks. With Super Duper, I'm a walking healing factory. 
---
I'm a crafter, so anything that gives me more for less is great. 
---
I dunno, there's one variety with a minigun or something that shreds me up pretty good.  Throw in a couple more with missile launchers and you have a pretty good throwdown.
---
I feel like this whenever I see a fan or a roll of duct tape. 
---
Sweet, thanks for answering. 
---
Do we know why the scorched never made it out of Appalachia?   
---
My character is named Matthew Hams who is the nephew of the sole survivor (who in my game is named John Hams)
---
Probably still Whitesprings even after xp nerf.  But if you are trying to avoid nuke areas all together you either hit the cranberry bog area (I forget the name, but there's a cave with ultracite veins and seemingly endless spawns) or you can take workshops and cycle through defense missions (slow but good source of resources).  
---
Yeah, I'm gonna leave it. 
---
Thanks for pointing it out. 
---
Lol this little cuck wants to have me PSN banned.
---
You must not pay attention to tje subreddit.
---
See, while im doing nothing wrong on bethesdas eyes, they can have you banned by gaystation.
---
Btw im pc fucking master race.
---
My guess is that the mods add a percentage to the total weight, and the 90% weight reduction interacts with that like any other mod would.
---
Ah I see thank you. 
---
I haven't gotten my melee damage anywhere near that high. 
---
You are talking about boblehead stacking I assume? That's a total different issue and IMO that needs to go. 
---
I've seen the video of the guy w the deathclaw gauntlet getting his damage high but that was in a team that let him stack all the perk buffs. That was an ideal situation. 
---
I've also seen a video from someone on this board that uses a pistol to kill a scorchbeast, deathclaw and some other tank monster in less then 2 minutes as a crit vat build. So, do you think pistols are OP as well? 
---
Anyway the bottom line is I don't think anything needs a nerf most of the time. TSE were insane for PVP definitely. I just do not think melee needs a nerf at all. 
---
Rifles need more armor pen. Weight reductions. Lasers need a huge buff. They still need to work on a lot of things but I'd say they should buff some of the gun mechanics first. Nerfing melee is not the answer though. 
---
Put them on the ground or kill them? Because if it's putting them on the ground that's what Bethesda wants, having to adapt your gameplay.
---
If you meant vat crits with a normal gun kills them then shhh you'll make them nerf crits
---
Because the Vault 76 dwellers killed them all off before they could spread.
---
Per the Fallout Wiki, 2197. So, between 1 and 2. 
---
Happiness is finding and enjoying a good game. 
---
I agree. I was high enough level before dupes got popular to see great variety when fighting the queen. It was way more fun to see the different stuff.
---
nice
---
Seriously note..How does one assume that the person doesnt know the difference ? 
---
And maybe merely didn't pay attention

Hmm just a thought

2 - Yes

3 - Anger (but yes)

Only scorched.
---
Id be looking for a little paper bag regardless. 
---
I can confirm that closing out\or going to menu and back into the game resolved this for me.
---
Spawning in frozen unable to move while I listen to something killing me is also super fun.
---
No. What *button* do?

That's part of the fun or randomly generate loot. 
---
But some of the effect in general should really be changed from primaries to secondary. Nobody cares about -15% from insects, but it wouldn't be a bad thing to have randomly as a secondary. 
---
Whole melee builds and weapons then, right? OP since beta.
---
this is the correct answer, know that its overrated and you wont see an increase in your number of stimpaks by having the ability to create them, you'll find more stimpaks hunting for the stuff you need to make them than youll get from crafting them
---
Have I not already told you I hardly do any nuke zones? Iv completed every quest in the game and had them all finished just after level 50. You can only do so many events a day before they become nap time. Sure I farm when I need mats for ammo acid is easy steel is easy but tons of lead isnt. So as everyone else does that needs lead I go to the lead farming hot zones. I didn't even do a nuke or even kill a queen until I could launch one myself as I didn't want it to ruin the game.
---
I built a a stealth sniper with semi auto rifle back up and spare points in shotgun for when thing get in tight because that is what I have enjoyed in previous fallouts. 100% completion on all previous fallouts infact. I even like you have some points in grenades. I had no problems without a TS or TSE before level 60 or so but as soon as the end game mobs came along they turned into bullet sponges. My build has and will work great until this patch comes out. Shortly after max level mobs started spawning I got a TS Lever Action from a drop. Took away that bullet sponge effect and made it's so chugging stimpaks any time a few mobs were packed up wasn't needed. Build worked great recently got a TSE Handmade to drop. Less than a week ago and I could finally see I was hitting a scorche beast queen. Could feel like I was contributing and not just tagging for the kill. I only use it on scorche beast as when something gets to close it blows you up rather quickly. All my other weapons are TSs that I got to drop minus my shotgun that is junk anyway. Those even take 3-4 hits to kill a mob. Not what I would consider over powered in any fashion. Worked out my build before I started playing on a website myself no copy and am just very angry that now this toon is no longer viable and a complete waste of time after months of playing the game as designed. Likely to the point of not wishing to play anymore just so PvP can still be unbalanced. So if your not looking for gear or plans what exactly are you doing? As far as I know once the story is complete all you can real do to improve your toon is hunt gear and do events. I am in a rp group and do that nightly but hardly anyone does that these days. Now I won't even be useful there once my massive stimpak stash runs out. Honestly it's just sickening that you can play as intended and still get completely screwed. I might consider staying if they give us a free respec. But without that even changing my toon to be useful again is completely pointless as it would take longer than just rerolling without the ability to do damage. 
---
Cool send me msg on xbox then 
---
You may be missing the point, this setup IS supposed to be a give and take and make you figure out what to not take and what to take. By complaining that you aren’t getting everything your countering what the company is trying to do in saying, hey, you can bee really strong but you sacrifice weight or you could be the pack rat but do very little damage. Do what the rest of us are doing and find a fucking balance.

Another idea would be to have legendary mobs not drop the weapons/armour but maybe plan fragments? So if you get say, 5 plan fragments it makes a random legendary mod for a random weapon. Not only would this make farming still rewarding, but it would also further encourage trading of items since there are loads to go for!

I used to kill them so I could revive them with the Ritual Stone. Maven Blackbriar pissed me off so I invaded Riften with a horde of undead giants.

This is the problem with level-adjusted enemy spawns.

Up north in an unmarked location to the east of the fairgrounds there is a beautiful lake that also has some loot and spawns low level ghouls &amp; scorched

---
I doubt it.   
---
They won't let up on the CAMP storage issue which means they are afraid that importing any more custom data into the servers will cause issues. Which still astounds me. How broken is this version of the engine, or the server it's running on? 
---
Anyway. 
---
Every time you'd customize a weapon, that'd be a new, unique field in the database...so to speak.   
---
So I wouldn't count on it.
---
Any weapon can one shot. Doesn't matter if the weapon does 1000 damage or 10000 damage. At some point all of those extra 5% and 10% are completely irrelevant.
---
Awesome. I need to remember to check the rooftops more often.
---
LF big stash goth gf, PM me
---
They nerfed Vampire, although unless you were using it on a melee weapon, it might not act different than before. Before Vampire on melee weapons gave you health regen each swing, no contact with an enemy needed. 
---
No water access so you're limited to setting up the small water purifiers on the area that's a bit on the hilly side. If you build your base two levels up there's Mirelurks or Radscorpions that you can tag in the distance.
---
For the record my instigating combat shotgun did much better against the bases.

Seriously. It's not. Not even the devs or publishers call this game an MMO, which should have been your first hint. Stop calling it an MMO. It's not. If it were, it would be even more of a shitshow than it already is.

At first I thought that other people might have been picking it up? But now months later I am sure that’s not the case

Were they wanted or does that event allow PvP?
---
I once had a post deleted because a mod took my suggestion that we contact a prominent YouTube duper's affiliates and suggest that they not support cheating as "witch hunting" despite that they define it as suggesting that people "go after other players in game." So we know they moderate posts to protect dupers.

We've been friends for a decade. I know his tastes in video games better then any reviewer. He jumped on the "76 trash" train. At first, I tried to convince him otherwise but I quickly stopped. He's stubborn as all hell. Every now and again he throws a jab at it, I laugh and ignore it. He sends me screenshots of him playing heavily modded fo4, I say nice! He mentioned that he's going to get fo3 and replay that. I say yea dude sweet! He brings 76 up all the time and I never do xD he wants me to sell him on 76 more but I refuse to feed into it haha. It's obvious he wants to play it but he's stubborn even to himself and I find that hilarious
---
That’s how I started! I used to watch him play fallout 4 and my favourite part was helping him decide how to decorate 
---
Here's what I did. I took the pics in the game's photomode. Then go to map, LB and select photo gallery. Make it full screen and hide AI. Then take a screenshot through xbox.  There might be a better faster way but that's what I did. 
---
This is great, thanks!  I usually bulk anything over the amount I want to hoard so I can sell it to vendors that way, but I've been bulking all the stuff that gives a weight savings since I became aware of that.  Thanks again for updating the info on this!

---
Oh wait they are in the game? 
---
That and not having to add in end game content. Why add in end game content if you can slow down the already tedious grind? 
---
Stupid as this may sound (i know plans drop from queen too) I refuse to player trade for my items right now because of all the dupers. Don't want to support any of that.
---
Sure I'll be back on in a few hours and a lot tomorrow. nanshaggr on PC, ill just give them to you 
---
&gt; On some enemies I'm sure an armor-piercing one would be better than the TS.
---
It's not. Armor piercing is broken or something right now. I've done fairly heavy testing and it provides 0 or close enough to 0 extra damage that I couldn't see it doing anything.
---
&gt; I have a two-shot .50 and the accuracy loss on the two-shot is significant enough to make it noticeable on mid to long-range.
---
Heavy weapons suffer at long range anyway, we don't want to be in melee range, but anything further than 20 ish feet and it doesn't matter if the weapon is TS or not, you're going to miss unless it's a mob the size in the realm of Deathclaws, SB's/SBQ.
---
&gt; Have I not already told you I hardly do any nuke zones?
---
Where did I say you do Nuke Zones? I didn't even use the term Nuke Zone. I literally read my post over 3 times to make sure I wasn't missing something. Because I mention scorched beast? You know they are not just in Nuke Zones? I'm sure you will now give some lecture about where scorched beasts can be found and how you killed your first one with a tomahawk at level 15. 
---
So you are clearly not even reading. So there's no point in even trying with a gamer like you. You read what others have done, you follow in their footsteps, then you act like you are the authority. But it's clear you aren't.

I wouldn't want to mark my CAMP's location on the map. Already run in to someone who wanted to blow it up for funzies :/

is there? how does it work?
---
There are two near Gillman Lumber mill, you can go to Vault 76 and just move south. Some people do use those areas...
---
Also The Savage Divide has a scattering of similar watered areas. there's a body or water just west of Pleasant Valley Station as well as more than a few in the wilderness if you trek in there, north east and south east. For example if you look at the map south, south east of the station where the green leaved flower is, there's a body of water there.
---
the problem is the silo quest resets for any user that disconnects (Even momentarily) from the server, and (under the assumption you've not been in) that can be dozens of stimpacks, 2mm wasted on assultrons, sentrybots, and gutsies that have now all respawned in the instanced area because it wasn't checkpointed.

I have spent the majority of my time building CAMPs. I just recently found a beautiful spot, and unfortunately getting the right placement was a pain.

I realized the tree's limbs were climb-able, and the CAMP turned green on certain branches, so I climbed as high as I could and placed the box. 
---
For someone like me who loves the game but dislikes a bunch of things about it, I'm on the verge of not playing any more because of crashes. If someone only kinda likes the game and they have the same crashing and disconnecting I don't think many will keep playing. And FO76 is like one of my favorite games, like the only game I play at the moment, and even I am on the verge of shifting my attention to something else.
---
Meanwhile melee can still one shot enemies and destroy the Queen in 2 minutes with some legendary bonuses... Is this some medieval fantasy game for everyone going melee?

For me to hit 1000 a shot with a Two Shot Explosive.50, I need adrenaline stacked... then combined with adrenal reaction and I'll steam roll any opposition. It's so much fun.

In Fallout 4, you play by yourself, in which they provided you with the path of becoming overpowered the longer you played because it was the only thing it had to longevity besides the main story. Due to the lack of limitations to junk, scavenging got to the point where it became non-existent since you could gather enough materials to upgrade you weapons and never worry about anything else since limitless cap pool was your main source for everything.
---
In Fallout 76, you play with other people, the game allows you to established a class, which adds variety to differentiate other players and introduces game elements that focus on balance, which also provides strategy and increases a game's longevity, which opens the doors to endgame content. You have more purpose to use drugs and scavenge junk to replenish your stash in this game than you did in Fallout 4. This game doesn't allow mods, and I hope it never does, because the majority people here seem to have been so pampered from previous titles that they will complain about something being too difficult or inconvenient in this game.

But tse rifles dont hit for 10k they hit for 380 to 450.  The shotguns do higher damage.  The maxed out tse guase does around 1550. With the nerf are looking at 130 to 150.

Plasma sucks anyways. I will say as a flamer it is better than the flamer weapon though. It does decent damage as a flamer against robots. 
---
I actually have a lvl 50 2 star as well. It's fun and when you use TSE heavy weapons, most of your points are in strength so while not quite a melee build... you still hit hard.
---
Melee build hit 10,000 dps builds with no bobble heads? Melee has been the most OP build in the game since Alpha and Beta. Melee still OP. They nerfed Explosive Damage in PVP with Fireproof and Padded and dense mods.
---
The problem with TSE was they was the symbol of duping. They are way behind in power compared to Melee. 
---
What need to be reworked and nerfed. Was Shotgun Pellets need nerfed each Pellet hits like an individual bullet. But that is how they programmed shotguns not all TSE.
---
Secondly they need to nerf Bobblehead stacking. Which can be down with Explosive and Melee. That’s how people get One Shot in PVP so easily.

They did day 2 expect a mess of a game. Todd said something like that in the e3 press conference and its bound 2 happen because this is they're first and probably only online game. Not counting ESO because its a completely different cup of tea, plus when ESO first come out shit was a shit storm. Try given them time too fix the admittedly glicthy and not overly well thought out game. Maybe it'll get better, hell maybe it won't. I'm just saying give them time

I miss being able to name them, especially being able to italicize them too in FO4. Makes it easier to find my main weapons if I italicized them and put a space so they always sorted to the top. Would love to see it back, but not so sure if and when it'd really be happening.

---
You can get a 10,000k melee builds right now.
---
Is anyone not getting prompted on corpses despite having cannibal? 
---
Is the perk bugged occasionally?
---
I never get prompted regardless of armor type etc idk but i did think it would be useful, hunger timer expiry is WAY too rapid imo
---
Dude I don't even watch YouTube videos. I said I don't do nuke zones because when someone says you only do a small part of the game that's normally what they mean. We probably have alot in common honestly. Your just not the one getting nerfed this week. Tell me I'm bad all you want I really don't give a shit. Probably have more of the game complete than you do.
---
Exactly. I dont expect pistols and smgs to be just as powerful as other weapon types, but just not completely useless.
---
No problem, I like the forest too but moved to the divide to have a free travel point on both sides of the map. 
---
The sad thins it... Skyrim already accomplished this.  There were very few "legendaries" or super unique weapons.  Aside from maybe the Dragon Priest masks, everything could be disenchanted and learned.  Crafted weapons were amazing, totally worth having those perks.
---
Why would anybody want to make the game that easy? I don't want to one-shot everything. 
---
Stannis is that you? 
---
Honestly, if the perk is available there should be no reason why you wouldn't have a chance of getting both. The weapons themselves should be made to be an extremely rare drop for sure, but should absolutely be taken off energy weapons and gauss rifles... the damage done with those alone by themselves even as a two shot are WAY overpowered.
---
The drone swarm is a good indicator of an expansion for that area. 
---
My game is indeed on 'fullscreen'
---
Rammstein!! Du hast mich jaja
---
Its the same with the All Rise you get as well 90% weight reduction so it only weighs 6lb's (or 8 cant remy off top off my head). My super sledges and sledge hammers don't weigh anywhere near 60-80lbs.
---
Such a shame but even stuff like this is broken and not working, when coders cant math right there's something going wrong somewhere.
---
Didn't pay attention 4 times, or just doesn't know the difference? Hmm.
---
That's hilarious!
---
&gt; I really want to go back to f76 guys but i can't bring myself to it.
---
One of the two sides to that statements is a lie. Which one is it?
---
"Do or do not" - Yoda
---
Its "just skyrim with guns"
---
Actually my absolute favorite spot in game. 
---
Also good for resource farming! Just to the south east of that location is a fair ground, which, like all fair grounds, is a good dump for screws and lead from the toys. As well as plastic!
---
To the south there is Tyler County Fairgrounds, which had a junk and aluminum node, handy for crafting as well and very easily defended. 
---
There are also a handful of farms around there that are easy farming spots. You also have easy access to Grafton and Wild Willy’s Water Park. 
---
Finally, you have two possible common events that spawn there. Leader of the pack, which spawns 3 guaranteed low level Legendary wolves and, upon completion gives you one on level legendary about 50% of the time. You also can get the Messenger event as well as Death Blossoms.
---
I had my base there for about a Month and loved it. 
---
Riles can fire many bullets in quick succession.
---
The only food buff that doesn’t stack is Carry Weight iirc. Or possibly duplicate effects. 
---
I know separate foods don’t interfere.
---
My CPU is an i7 8700 non K model.
---
Oh. Well nevermind then. I feel dumb
---
Swimming along that invisible wall is how I found Deathclaw Island
---
This is an amazing idea and it could also tie in with player vendimg and create a marketplace
---
I heard they randomly pick users put of a hat and just ban them. 
---
Same here. Fun times.
---
You've just discovered their development roadmap. 
---
Child at heart 
---
  (  ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )
---
Did you recently fight a scorched queen? It is a drop from her. That is when mine popped into my inventory. 
---
I got one of these on recording! To date it’s in my top five favorite kills just because of the spin and slow fall combo
---

---
You should probably wait until the game gets a content update. If you didn't stop playing because of the power difference in weapons this patch won't be giving you much. Wait for a content update to ask instead of bug fixes. I doubt anyone left because of the bugs over the lack of content
---
He was the one that taught me to play! 
---
4 times ? Its all one post. so yeah would be a bit odd to have 2 there and 2 they're 😂 but sure man whatever floats your boat 🤣
---
Would offer to help but I’m on xbx1. Good luck. 
---
Im waiting for some good Raider gear 😥
---
I can't disagree with  you man.  The whiners and tedious moaners have f#cked this joint.
---
I would have pre-ordered if they had shown this
---
Yeah. Thought i dint get anything
---
Don't, man there's a lot going on with that quest haha
---
Get some jumper cables on it, should fix it.
---
At least there nice on the ammo weight. In real life a single .45 round weighs 0.7 oz. 50 rounds should weigh just over 2 lbs.
---
Wait for the defense mission to switch to a retake mission.  You only have to deal with 1 wave that way, and still get the same rewards.
---
Oh god...they have babies??? Nooooo
---
I hear you I have had the game for about a month now. It was ok I would get kicked off once a day not too bad. But since last Saturday I can't play longer than 30min. I just tried to play and I can't play at all. I am on PS4 I feel that these server's should be priority number one. I can play with glitches and stuff like that in the game but I can't play at all with the servers messing up. 
---
Wait, im confused. How does anyone else prevent you from selling? I mean besides having to wait for them to maybe finish a transaction theyre in the middle of. 
---
I wish 
---
Several bugs in one video
---
GBO-Possum
---
Video = https://youtu.be/14ncFozicOg
---
Description of the issue (what happened, where did it occur, what did it affect, quest name etc.)
---
Summary = Multiple Server disconnections, inability to place objects even when green. Invisible assailants. No pipboy. Lockup.
---
I’m used to getting one or two server disconnects on any day of playing FO76, however this was a particularly bad run, including approximately 15 disconnects.
---
It all started when I logged in to find that my CAMP space was occupied. I decided to go with the flow and look for a new home. Typically what happened was that some time after I had successfully placed my stored structure at its new location, I’d get a server disconnect. I would place the structure, maybe place the stored Industrial Water Purifier, a bunch of corn etc, grab some stuff out of my Stash and then “server disconnected”.
---
When I got back into my world, the CAMP was sometimes completely gone (in which case I’d have to pay for CAMP relocation again), sometimes the little CAMP device would survive.  After a few iterations, my stored Industrial Water Purifiers disappeared from the “Stored” status and I had to build them again.
---
At first, I guessed it was an issue with the location I had chosen to set up CAMP, so I’d try another place on the map. That didn’t work.
---
Then I thought that if I placed the CAMP device without placing the stored structure, and then exited, then I might be forcing a “save” and the CAMP might be there when I returned. That didn’t work.
---
Then I thought that maybe the servers were just “having a bad day”, so I should try, try again. That didn’t work.
---
Eventually I tried breaking down the stored structure into its component parts (floors, stairs, turrets etc) and rebuild from scratch. That worked, and so far the server disconnects have not recurred at this breakneck pace.
---
Along the way I have found that placing objects may be indicated as being “legal” (i.e. green) yet when I press “X”, an error message pops up denying me the ability.  The outline is still green. 
---
After a couple of server disconnects, I returned to the world to find myself under attack by invisible assailants, and unable to equip a weapon, load ammo, open pipboy, or even jump. I could only walk and watch as blood spattered my screen and I lost health. Then the game locked up, as you’ll see in the video above
---
After the saga was complete and I had finally got past these bugs, I found that the weight of stuff in my stash had reduced from just under 600 to about 450. Maybe this was as a result of having to rebuild CAMP objects which had disappeared forever, however, that seems maybe a bit high.
---
When did this occur? Take a look at the filename in the YouTube video for the timestamp
---
How? Are they blocking you from getting to a vendor? 
---
I run almost an identical build. I use a bloodied grognaks and a instigating super sledge with it. I do feel a bit overpowered sometimes.
---
What's the point of perking to be able to take perks to do that?
---
It almost makes me want to switch to PC.
---
Built a stable for y'all to keep your high horses in 😂
---
I’m the opposite. I have hundreds of screws, springs, and gears. But I craft my ammo so I’m always in need of steel and lead 😪
---
I would be thrilled with just a Camp and a Combat loadout for the perk cards. 
---
So just because some dimwit dupers used hundreds of explosive bobbleheads to oneshot  stuff, making TSE weapons so "overpowered" they now nerf the TSE weapons instead of just fixing the bobbleheads?  
---
I were yet able to get a damn TSE weapon and have some fun with it myself and yet again a dev decides to exclude me from that fun because some degenerates are too stupid tor realize that the problem doesn't lie within the weapon  but the players discovering flaws in the system and abuse it.  
---
Great. And loads of other weapons who could be strong but got neglected doesn't get a buff so you soon have to ditch EVERY SBQ fight because no one is able to dish out damage against her anymore once all 20 level 10 players jump in to the event and scale the queen beyond any reasonable healthpoints.   
---
Thank you.  
---
To both those players who are at fault and abused the system to make it look really broken and those idiot players who start crying and ruin the fun for those who do not abuse the system at all.
---
Eat ass
---
Those pvp servers have had population decline, thus a need to include a new approach.
---
Right now no, people don't play fallout for pvp, but before fallout 4 people didn't play fallout for settlement building. 
---
It looks like I already gave it away. I'll keep an eye out.
---
You specifically want a Single Action Revolver, yeah? I think I have an Assassin's Western Revolver.
---
I should've specified, sorry. I meant emptying out the vendors caps for the time with their transactions.
---
False
---
I will never kill a cute fox
---
Oh, sweet - Don't need them all (spread the love around) - Sengfeng (or some variant of that. Don't remember if I had to add numbers or something).
---
(Dangit Bethesda, why can't you access your friends from the launcher???)
---
Ha...yeah bit they sure are creepy looking! Plus in real life..beavers can be badass mofo's!
---
I'd suggest reading up on caps replenishment and instanced vendor inventory.
---
its almost like different people have different opinions... glitch in the matrix it seems.
---
The reason vendors don't have caps is because you sold everything for the day, not because other people got there first. It's hard to get the hang of but stores restock every 20 hours. Their inventories are character locked, not server locked. 
---
For plants I set up the rocket turrets. Setting up lights to shine directly on the plants helped with early detection.
---
So? 
---
I agree I'm just saying that compared the rest of the effects two-shot doesn't seem so OP, how spongy enemies are is the fault of enemy health being too high or weapon damage being too low.
---
Does the minigun need a buff? I was using it earlier to kill the queen and it destroyed. I love it tbh just hate its weight. You def have me with the lmg though. I think it could do with an ammo change and a damage boost. It should do like 30 damage
---
They may have been behind in raw power, but it was the combination of factors that made them popular.
---
For one thing, TSEs did less damage than melee, but more than other guns. This, by itself, already required a nerf.
---
Secondly, explosive portion of the damage had no damage falloff, unlike the regular projectile damage. Which allowed people to snipe with explosive shotguns, which was clearly not intended. Even though pellet damage at max range fell off to almost zero, explosive damage still hit in full.
---
And finally, there's the AoE component. Melee might do 10k a hit, but you only hit the one target. With TSE, you could fire a single shell into a room full of ghouls, and that's all it took for the room to be full of minced meat and nothing else. Melee would have one-shot each one, but it would have had to one-shot each one. Explosive weapons, especially TSE, were just too damn efficient at clearing clumps of enemies in tight spaces. 
---
Add all of these together, and that's why TS and Explosive had to be nerfed. They just far overshadowed every other gun. That melee was more powerful still is a whole other ball game (and I'm assuming coming in future patch). My prediction is that Twisted Muscles and Talons will get knocked down to 5-10%, at the very least, and Incisor likely will drop to 55%. 
---
&gt; I've read overdrive helps with the Gatling since it will crit out of vats
---
Does it now? That's interesting! I'd been wondering why my gatling sometimes hits like a truck... I just figured it was because it was bloodied and I wasn't paying enough attention to the extra damage I got from lower HP as the fights went on.
---
Yeah that's a good point, found that out the hard way: Stressin over having most of the workshops.
---
Wait until you kill one that doesn’t die right away and you have to stare into its eyes!
---
https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/tempest-storm27/video/65979814
---
I held his hand as he collapsed.... I don’t kill megasloths anymore guys... ;(
---
Learned this from another comment, thank you for telling me though.
---
Unless the names are just visible to the player? And they could sensor rude words like club penguin lol
---
I hear you loud and clear and agree. They're nerfing guns instead of sorting out servers. Problem with servers is they are owned by Amazon I believe and it's possible they're waiting 2 see how well the game does before fixing servers. Obviously bot great which is probably why the servers as still as shit as day one and now the only way 2 (dupe) is by dropping the server.... In other words. I don't think Bethedsa can do anything about it for the time being. But this is mostly guess work on my behalf 
---
So I can play with my cute friends and have a cute time, duh.
---
Ignore it. It's just an anecdotal urban legend type of thing.
---
Like uh.... putting garlic in your sock drawer stops you from getting killed by super mutants in the game.
---
Lol man I wish I had room in a stash. I'm carrying almost 30 on me at all times lolol
---
Or the Galleria...
---
i tend to go in alone max sneak/covert op so, tends to not be too difficult it's just annoying when i've used 30 rounds from my trusty nightvision vamp gaus (suppressed naturally) and around 70 from my lever just to have it freeze out, go back in from square one and start all over again.
---
It was workable - Friend request sent.  
---
Other gaming subs have much higher numbers and manage to be on top of those reports and remove duplicate posts and funnel people to existing posts.
---
Maybe it's a lack of numbers but that ain't exactly hard to fix.
---
Nerf melee
---
They wanted to remain lore-friendly with the rarity of ballistic fiber in the game.
---
😂 glad i can be or service 😎 
---
Slacken419 add me Ill lend a hand
---
Check out this link. Some vendors are part of the same faction (who share the same cap pool): https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9xvioy/all_vendor_locations_map/
---
Nice, gave me some cool ideas too.
---
You're welcome. To maximize your cap collection maybe consider making some alts. You can get 1400 caps per day from each FACTION per character. The factions are Responder, Raider, Free States, Enclave, Brotherhood of Steel, Whitesprings, and Watoga. BoS vendor is also in Watoga
---
I think they will open vaults and push the boundaries back on the map for dlc, because it seems obvious. But i do worry, there aren't too many vaults and vaults themselves aren't super huge. Makes me wonder if the vaults will break away to massive underground areas. Really doubt we would get new locations like traditional fallout dlc's.
---
Was this post inspired by _The Incredibles_ ?
---
I wonder why they didn't make it where you can decide if you want to play online or offline
---
if you have stuff you don't want, leave it in suitcases outside railway stations and level 12 players (like me) will be happy to stumble across it
---
Just to add to your post, an easy way to share is xboxdvr.com. Just type in your gamertag and it'll show you all your clips and screenshots. Easy to link.
---
The fusion core generators at some workshops, such as Poseidon in Charleston. They only pump out one an hour though. I find it easier to find them in buildings or in power armor chassis’ in the wasteland
---
I think bethesda believes fixing the dupes will eliminate bobbleheads. Server disconnects will eventually eat the dropped bags. Leaving the quantity of tse in the game at that level would have made the eventual higher level weapons unnecessary. I think the tse nerf is necessary, but saying so directly seems to upset tse owners. Even they must admit everyone having them would be bad. 
---
Every person has their own cap allowance at the vendors. It resets every 24 hours or so. If you go to a vendor and they dont have caps, you either havnt waited long enough OR the display is bugged. Try to sell something even if it says they have zero caps, and if youve waited long enough, itll correct itself to say they have caps now. 
---
People would constantly compare it with the new vegas mod
---
Lol I use TSE and it really kills one in enemy in one shot and differently not a whole wave of enemies. This is bullshit and rumor. The only TSE Weapons that could do that was a shotgun and I stated shotguns need the pellets to be reworked.
---
The only time I One Shot Enemies Of they are low level.
---
I use a level 50 Combat Shotgun my dps is only like 430 that’s with max Rifleman and Demolitionist. It usually takes 3-4 bullets to kill unless I hit crit shots to the head then 2 shot.
---
Errr i think they'll sooner fix the fps dip than give everyone free atoms for a skin.
---
Ive gotten my strength close to 30. 
---
there are females in this game playing right now … you're welcome.
---
Low grade troll bro
---
 I strongly advise you to not--I repeat, NOT--belittle a super mutant for taking the bunny slope
---
I'll give this a try, thanks!
---
It would be amazing. 
---
Dope, that's what I assumed just want to make sure. 
---
This is sick
---
There's a perk card that does exactly that and it's even called Suppressor lol
---
It’s made of lead that is super compacted and...stuff
---
No problem. 
---
I need to do SBQ on your server... I go in there loaded with the best I can get (stimmed, bobblehead, magazine, foods, 2k+ ammo, chems) to the point my gun is listed 3k dmg a bullet.  I start melting the queen, and then the entire server shows up and ruins the whole thing (most of them sub 40s).  I can carry a lot of weight, but I can't carry the whole server to kill that queen.
---
Got any suggestions to help my success rate?
---
Time to move!
---
What is better about pc?
---
I find that more of a hassle and the benefits are too low for me to care. I usually just stick with eating people.
---
They are nowhere as a whole as OP as Melee. The TSE shotguns need nerfed. That’s because the way Bethesda codes it all the pellets act like individual bullets that do full damage. But That is Shotguns and not TSE Guns as a whole.
---
Nope just the complaints about the nerf. It's only unfair if you have one and made your build around it. 
---
RIP my Anti Armor Explosive MG42. The damage from the explosive effect and Demolitions Expert was the only thing that made it viable. 
---
That gun needs a major buff. It's damage is a joke with how much you have to invest in it just to burn through 75 rounds to take a super mutants health down half way. While barrel stuffing them with the absurd recoil. 
---
I want to try again this weekend, but I couldn't protect the robots in the prep stage.  I better hurry though before they nerf my two shot and I'm weak as shit again.
---
I've been playing since launch.
---
Playing an alt through the game again after all these patches has greatly increased my enjoyment of the game.
---
Knowing the endgame is pretty shallow had me exploring more, reading more and not racing to the end.
---
oh, cool glad you liked it. I think the photo makes it look worse as its hard to use photo mode inside. :(
---
Lol without legendaries you still can’t do that🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Melee does not clear rooms before anyone else can tag.
---
You...MONSTER!
---
Kill everything before it becomes scorched.
---
Can’t leave any potential hosts, sorry in advance if they introduce killable children
---
This would be nice but i think my biggest issue with the radio is theres no host i kinda miss that from the other fallout games
---
Hell yeah
---
Well yeah but in terms of other gun builds its one of the best bets still. I do think melee needs toned down significantly.
---
Common prob. You can remediate it by stashing you non quest holos (0 weight) and trying again. Worked for me.
---
Hold my beer...
---
Get the railroads and a small train online and make a PVP&amp;PVE related event where you stop from station to station and the longer you hold/travel along with the train the better rewards you get. Also make an incentive where the longer you hold it, the more rewarding it is for other players to take it from you.
---
Idk I’ve been tossing that idea in my head around for a while
---
I play with my dick out, I can confirm that it increases the frequency of critical hits
---
"What food and drink do you use in the end game"
---
Whatever fills us up enough so we can fast travel.
---
Most people just shove whatever is edible in their pie-holes. I've caught myself wishing the flavored mentats fed us
---
I've been trying to get help on a bugged (but "completed" Recruitment Blues since Jan 4.  They've asked for permission to reset my progress on the quest chain, I said Yes - and crickets since then.
---
Just eat whatever I pick up.  The game is too easy at the moment to care about any buffs really.
---
Personally I think by the end of year one that entire region will be vastly expanded 
---
Yeah protest march is by far the buggiest one
---
If you made your build around two-shot-explosive and it somehow doesn't work right now before anything was changed and it will somehow not work with slightly reduced damage.... I have questions. Many questions.
---
Thanks! I'll try that.
---
This would be a very cool camp to find. Well done I like the simplicity in the lounge area. 
---
Don’t know what that is but if I’m reading correctly then the listed dmg gets applied like 6 or 8 times for each flechette??? That’s crazy
---
Exactly
---
Please nerf fall damage too, I hate how it can 1 shot me
---
... I just crapped mine out into a paper sack.
---
uh, thanks, though, 7 mininukes.  you ... uh...
---
... bye.
---
I use the power attack (R1 button on PS4) a lot. It does so much damage.
---
Yep.....spot on. Thanks. I filled in a ticket to tell Bethesda.
---
Stop being racist then op.
---
I keep stocked up from ionized meat, it fills 60% of my food with carnivore and perks plus it doesn't spoil
---
Mele is so much fun to play with though. Especially with nerd rage ext, adds some challenge back to the game with the constant risk of dying 😂
---
But.....HOW
---
No problem, just let me know how many you want. I was going to just drop them in a suitcase or something at a station.
---
Yeah, so now you lose double the durability and have drastically increased recoil and lower accuracy for 25% more damage. 
---
So basically 2 shot is just the "violent" modifier from FO4
---
Shoot the ground, clear the room, even with a rifle
---
Melee is OP for dummies get guud and they can't touch you
---
Welcome to the wasteland buddy!
---
*tears open jugular with teeth
---
Do you know if the Scorchbeast in Glass Caverns is always there or just there for the quest?
---
Wow what floor is that
---
Not yet :(
---
Im waiting patiently. Ill update as soon as I get a reply.
---
Knives is my spirit animal
---
yeah sorry i realized you were probably on console after i posted my comment. 
---
I had that exact thing happen. I opened a ticket and after about 12 hours was rewarded with something like "I'm sorry for the inconvenience but we're not at fault for missing items."
---
Uhm, yes you are Bethesda. Your servers are directly responsible for my inventory since it's an online game. 
---
You forget the gap a melee player has to close in order to land a strike. In addition melee players are usually running with low armour and low health. Even with the TSE nerf a properly built shotgun will do 500 damage per pellet. 7 pellets in a shot that is 3500 damage. with chameleon you can sit invisibly anywhere and pick off a melee player. 
---
I get this, not what they’re describing. Is this second screen a console issue, whereas our problem is PC-only?
---
Deathclaw Wellington (+3 STR for 60 minutes), Cranberry Relish (+10% XP for 60 minutes) and Smoked Mirelurk Filets (+30 carry weight and can breathe underwater for 90 minutes). I make them for my team every day, and also reward anyone that brings me salt, pepper, and spices with some in return. I don't think there's a market to sell them unless player vending (when implemented) will have a food vending machine that preserves them so they don't spoil.
---
hmm well, the floor took me about 3 hours and finicking to get it all down lol 
---
Why are you trying to pay for food or water? It is extremely easy to get. Use the good boy perk and pick up every can of dog food you see. That's the only food you'll ever need. Make a water purifier at your base, that'll supply you will plenty of clean water
---
HOW??
---
I am not a fan of the nerf coming myself. I really think it punishes too many players for something dupers and exploiters ruined and make look so overpowered.  
---
But jeez.  
---
Reacting immature in that scale is really not the way to get your voice heard. Especially if you start harrassing other people. Makes me wonder if you can go any lower than that now.
---
Hope it works!
---
I don't know if it stacks. I am just going of the assumption that the more you hit it in the five seconds after the first hit you do an additional 5,6,7 percent damage.
---
I swear it just disappeared. I’m not to upset about it but they need to fix it. I can’t prove that I didn’t sell it or something but I’m usually really careful so I don’t know.
---
You mean the gap that can be closed instantly with vats?
---
Does it not puff out black smoke?  What about it makes it better for FPS?
---
This must severely limit the entertainment options you have available. Like, you can't play any of the GTA games, or Red Dead, no Assassin's Creed. Can't watch Star Wars, basically any Tarantino movie is out...are the Avengers movies all in order? I don't think so but I don't know for sure. Either way, I respect the discipline even if I don't understand it.
---
It’s so amazing but so far all my attempts at one have failed how’d you make it work?
---
Bullshit you can't.
---
Crits to the head are the corner stone of vats builds.
---
My hardened combat rifle drops lvl 68 primus super mutants with a single crit to the dome.
---
Is this the second freakout post? Did I miss one or three? Maybe it's like 5th...
---
You'll be fine. I promise. The world isn't fair, but the is the least unfair thing you're going to face.
---
Well yeah that plastic box is valuable 
---
Stealth Pistol vats build btw
---
Not sure if it stacks or not.
---
No melee only kills everything one hit and guns users can not hit enemies.
---
The facts are TSE Shotguns needed Nerfed cause each pellet does full damage as one bullet. Each pellet counts as a bullet that hits for full damage.
---
Bobblehead stacking needed to be nerfed.
---
TSE are being prosecuted because of the duping...and the fact Melee users hate TSE. 
---
But Melee weapons and armor was duped just as much. And Melee u one hit everything and you cry about TSE supposedly one shorting everything..,Double Standard much?
---
Already has a mod for perk loadouts.
---
Sorry to say but support tickets are only useful for letting them know about bugs or glitches. They arent going to do anything to actually help you
---
By far my favorite fo4 npc!
---
just go to the cave and try (for a long time) to get the floors to be nice
---
Poor SBQ, she's gonna have to learn how to kill via tickling... She barely does any damage as it is....
---
I'm pretty sure its always there, went on a farming run and no one had the quest and it was there, then respawned a few minutes after we killed it.
---
Yea but travis was anoying and mr new vegas sounded creepy

Well, personally I'd consider Fallout 1, 2 and Tactics to be the classic fallout games. Speaking of which, I wish they could bring the classic Colt 10mm Pistol from Fallout 1 and 2 like they did back in Fo4 on Creation Club: https://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Classic_10mm_pistol
---
Looks like I’m gonna drop several hours to try again 
---
Are you making up a story to try to discredit as a made up story?  Not really cool. 
---
Yeah the fusion generator plans and a windmill so far..
---
yeah okay.
---
took me forever
---
To do VATs I have to see you first. You still have the advantage with chameleon. You just need to hide and wait.

Tut. While I'd rather not kill the Miss Nanny, I think the Robobrain would make a much better spouse. You don't _really_ want a girl who doesn't understand sarcasm, do you? A Miss Nanny would be a deer in the headlights the first time you made a rude joke.

It’s awesome

I don't even need to swing to kill you. That's how OP it is. I once dropped a melee weapon in front of someone and they died. OPL33TSK1LLZZ 
---
Just don't nerf my flare gun. 
---
I'll one shot your tight ass with my shotty, but a nerf isn't going to happen.
---
what?  I did that and I feel bad about killing Brahmin now.
---
"You are mean and a bad person!"

"I'm running away from you now, you asshole"

No, it’s fine. I get that it’s frustrating.

It isn't about trying to pay, it is about trying to develop an economy. First by finding an underserved market!

I thank Bethesda placed TSE weapons in the game assuming that once people got them, they'd stop weapon farming at white springs and focus on the queen. 
---
I mean, that 's what I did one I got a TSE mini-gun, TS gatling plasma, and TSE cryolator.  Why do I need to continually farm for more powerful weapons? 
---
I have guns with instigating and furious effects for everyday use. I set the TSE weapons aside until someone nukes fissure site prime. 
---
Using  TSE weapon at an event or at white springs is kind of ridiculous. 
---
But most people with TSE seem to have a mindset that is the polar opposite of mine.
---
Dude some people play without vats crits man I actually like ads and never use vats :p lol you keep using your non leggys 
---
should be a little easier and better looking for you now that the tree from the entrance can be bulldozed and I'm not trying again 
---
What would help is the lower your health the lower you movement speed or just reduce damage against other players and/or stop multiple damage modifiers.
---
I think the added modifiers on legendaries is a good thing as it gives people something to build towards and/or something to be ambitious about to strengthen their builds. But however I think they just need to finalize stacking in this game, only allow 1-2 offensive multipliers and 1-2 defensive multipliers and cap them. Right now 9 points in a rifle perk build with a normal combat rifle .. meh, 9 points in a rifle build with 5 points in explosive and a TSE combar rifle OP .. needs tweaking but long term tweaking.

I’ve turned it off now through frustration but I’ll add you next time I’m on. 👍🏻
---
I can't wait for pvp servers to come up and all these try hards come up against actual pvp players with builds and gear revolving around it.
---
Sentinel/assassins with blocker layered on top is going to be a rude awakening.
---
Especially with a chain critting rifle build.
---
Vats increases meter by 15% allows 100% crits on a vats build and bloodied is mandatory for melee to do high damage.
---
I've only played 4 and a bit of nv, what the hell are super mutants, and does it make sense they are in this game? Ta
---
I wad trying to make a post to sell ammo abd was blocked : /
---
Because they're idiots 
---
Seems like anything thats good in this game is either super rare, or nerfed to the hilt, I think Bethesda devs are punishing this franchise's longtime fans. except for the rusty knuckles, Ive seen no other excavator plans. 
---
What's your armor like? I recommend some vanguard/sentinel/cavalier with a dense lining. My ballistic is almost 400 in regular armor, so it takes a while to chew through my shield. The only thing I worry about are masses of charred ghouls, one shot killers like behemoths, assaultrons, or deathclaws.
---
NO NO!!!!
---
- Not without giving her targets to "test" her weapons on, and they have to deserve it too.
---
or the mailbox next to the train station.
---
Have you launched a nuke before?
---
Lol yeah but still feels a little more like a real radio station right now it just feels like someone left spotify on shuffle then left 
---
I want to use it, I just worry about the ban hammer coming down. 
---
You'll be fine. Bloodied is more fun for that build anyway.
---
I think food items are too easy to find for there to be a market for them. Unless it is specific cooked food that people are after, then maybe
---
yeah apparently not.
---
Nerf Whitesprings golf club too.
---
Stop spawning weak legendary ghouls and make people play the game. Go kill legendary super mutants and Mr. Gutsy.
---
End the Fallout 76 penny slots.
---
That is sweet, is that the cave up North of the map ?
---
I have all seven sets. A max level of each all repaired to 200% with Targeting HUD, jetpack, and calibrated shocks (except Ultracite PA which I have Core Assembly because there's no Jet Pack and Excavator which I have Motion-Assist servos to boost carry weight). All painted except Raider, Excavator, and Ultracite because there is no paint for them. T-45: Hot Rod, T-51b: Nuka Cola, T-60: BoS Initiate, X-01: Blackbird.
---
Yes haha.   
---
At the top of the cave is a hole you can build over. I made a small square and put my fusion generator and ran the wire in the hole to the cave.
---
Well yeah once you get up in levels any dragon is going to hammer a regular scorche beast. A regular dragon dose like 400 damage without it's legendary effect put in. The TS effect is literally the only think that makes rifles playable and it is not overpowered in those. My fully modded hunting rifle TS still takes 4 shots atleast to kill most mobs. Without the TS a rifle build will not even be playable. 
---
Well, the night I went through most of that quest chain, I was drinking beer... But anyway. the actual way you're supposed to do things, is get Defiance has Fallen (BOS), they tell you to join the military, go to Camp McClintock, go through Basic Training, get soldier cert.  Later on, you have to go through the Charleston DMV (supposed to be a royal PITA stupid questline, but anyway), you do it, take your photo, get a military ID, and ultimately you can get some plans for Power Armor out of a terminal.
---
Well, I did the Back to Basics part before the Defiance has fallen.  After that, I had one login that started popping up "Recruitment Blues" as a quest, then it vanished, and it shows up in my quest log as completed.  I've never done the DMV questline, nor do I have my military ID, or been able to get my Ultracite power armor.
---
Supposedly without the Military ID, you can't get to the 4th floor of Fort Defiance.  Well, I have no Military ID, and can do anywhere in the place!  Elevators are accessible, all terminals are accessible, but Traggerdy's terminal doesn't give me the loot.
---
Yeah near the vault
---
I play a vats pistol no pa build so I dont really care. Bobbleheads will go away for the most part when duping is finished.
---
The e in any tse was too much for so many people to have. If everyone had it it would be bad, if just a few got lucky, fine, awesome to run into that guy. The way it was just was not even with non dupers and dupe buyers. I think everyone can agree everyone having them would be bad. 
---
I actually prefer it this way, keep the ammo semi-rare. Make the LMG receivers do the same damage as its hunting rifle equivalent. Use recoil and ammo scarcity as the balancing parameter. These weapons should be feared, and be really expensive to operate. Especially in a wasteland.
---
FO76 is a terribly unbalanced game. There is no absolutely no balance in this game and there will never be unless they do a full reset (duping). The legendary system is the definition of unbalanced.  
---
The endgame content will be either balanced for TSE (making it legitimately impossible for non TSE users) or will be balanced for normal setups but TSE users will be able to solo clear it with their eyes closed. 
---
Also melee is far better than any non TSE gun so really nice balance 👍
---
You still need to be relatively close (within 15 feet) to melee lunge
---
I had the same experience. I was doing “belly of the beast” I ran through 8 times getting disconnected and having to start over each time. Then when I was borderline low on ammo and made it through to the Sierra Bravos at the end someone dropped a nuke and I had to bail while overencumbered. But I did get to come back and help take down a SB queen and countless other monsters.

Sorry man. Even a sword bayonet from ww2 garand rifle isnt 6 friggin pounds. 
---
-*flips table*- my immersion!!!
---
Which .50 receiver did you put on your .308? While I know it doesn't do more damage, I do remember them matching in damage (.50 reciever vs .308 hardened) for the before I retired my hunting rifle for a gauss. What I thought was odd is that there's a damage difference with a lower level gun but it seems to close the gap at higher level. I haven't logged in on my main in a while but I'll check tonight. 
---
I love this idea.  We really are lacking a player hub.  I would add in that it should be a non-combat area, I.E. you can't even draw your weapon when in the vault.  This would prevent people from griefing the area and messing with people trying to sell their items. 
---
Be able to have an in server call-out to invite ppl to join whatever event you are in? Helpful to people who mostly play alone? 
---
ok cool, it's dope ..
---
We have the same base. Mine is dirty as shit and requires marsupial to leave it as I blocked off the main opening. There's a pretty consistent high level spawn there. 
---
No, but I only tried twice.  Once solo when I couldn't get past the prep stage and then I got a couple of randoms on F-ing new years when Bethesda broke the silos for a week.
---
&gt; but at the same time there's this class of hyper powerful explosive weapons in the game with easier to get &amp; carry ammo that didn't get looked at at the same time so it is... ~~weird.~~ heartbreaking
---
The AGN is a fun gun and I enjoy using my TS AGN but it's simply not a good weapon to use. Even if it had all my heavy weapon perks added up to it, it'd only be SO-SO and with the TS nerf incoming it's going to turn to straight garbage for all situations. Good thing I also have a two shot tesla rifle for tagging shit at the club house.
---

Thats exactly what i said......
---
The perk investment for vats is how you do high damage with guns.....
---
Non vats isn't is strong and it won't be buffed to one shot just because.
---
A dozen or 2 would keep me for a while.  Working on a diet to get my weight down so I can free myself of Power armor a bit (screwed up a perk card and can't put my stimpack weight reduction perk back on until I move two more spots from luck to Str!)
---
I'm down for a Scorched Beast King...
---
...or a Honeybeast Queen (with associated drones, workers, etc.)
---
Also, aiming is different from shooting...  you get the +10% while aiming, not hip-firing.
---
I have a very nice bloodied crossbow.
---
It doesn't have sneak attack bonus. Test on the lvl1 radroaches and scorched. I have lvl50 alien blaster and with fusion mag (without a Gunslinger perk, but with 3* Bloody Mess) it does 15 damage. My favourite gun from all the series  is completely broken. Why Beth hates energy weapons so much?
---
really? nothing ever spawns for me and I'm lvl 150 plis
---
Idk 900 damage a shot is pretty good I’d say
---
Can also drop a dozen other meaningless holotape and it will work. Has to do with having too many tapes causes the bug.
---
What I had to do and it worked
---
It's sad that people need to rely on vats so hard to be successful instead of using actual skill to aim and shoot
---
Thanks, I will go check it out when I am next in the area.
---
Someone on this thread has offered to help too. 
---
Maybe we should all team up!
---
Well bon voyage I guess 
---
I'd love this. When I played WoW, I spent so much time in Stormwind at the auction house or using the bank. I could send things easily to my friends or to my Alts. This game could learn a lot from what made WoW so good in this respect. We really do need a central hub. I'm a filthy casual and I really wouldn't mind buying or trading with other players  or an auction but have absolutely no idea how to go about it. I'm not going to walk up to randoms and ask to trade. I'd love to see this implemented but I don't think it should be level specific. It should be an available space for all to use. One of the neatest things in WoW was being new and seeing all the higher levels in their fancy gear and crazy mounts in the cities. 
---
&gt;Yes, if someone starts to claim your workshop they are now allowed to kill you or destroy anything you own regardless of where it is.
---
Well that obviously needs fixing ffs.
---
Are you sure it always did this? Haven't played for a month or so now, but since launch, I never had an issue. When I moved a floor, it moved the crafting stuff on it too. Same with walls and posters. I did it to make it easier to rebuild my bases quicker, cause going thru every piece was dumb. 
---
But now I'm paranoid hahaha. Never had this issue before, but I'll be sure to work my way from the top down from now on to make sure it doesn't affect me. Cheers!
---
I don’t see this mod being a problem. It doesn’t allow anything you can’t already do, it just makes it faster. I use that, and the one that shows you which plans you already know.
---
Right now Bethesda only seems to care about mods that allow you to access forbidden areas, or ones that give you a gameplay advantage. But use at your own risk, I guess.
---
The thing with That is energy resistance isn't reduced by any anti armor perks. 
---
So using an energy weapon against robots (which have lower base energy resistance, so you would think to use energy weapons against them) or a ballistic weapon with the tank killer perk. The reduction of armor from the tank killer now makes the ballistic weapon better than the energy one. Even against enemies is supposed to be good for.
---
Plan your full build in advance. Spend your first day watching videos and reading posts because trying to respec later and using up your levels to move points around is a pita. 
---
Yeah I just sleep on my hard wood floors now it’s been a real life changer!
---
Neither.  One of their group owned a workbench so when I initiated the capture it flagged them all for PVP.  
---
Instigating and furious effects work well on run-of-the mill bullet sponges.  Not a one shot kill, but maybe a 3-4 shot kill. 
---
I only use my TSE weapons on the queen, because that's the only scenario where it really does become important in accomplishing the mission.  I high level OP weapon is meant for high level OP enemies. People people are using TSE at events and white springs nuke zone. 
---
Nah you the reason I don’t want to play this game anymore. I’m end game. I didn’t put this much sweat in just so I could be doing the same damage as I was lvl 50 makes no sense? How bout a buff to armor since I can’t even make better armor since lvl 50? Or how bout private servers so snowflakes like you can run around being a little pixie splashing enemies with glitter, while I’m on my own server being king of the land doing whatever I want such a VIDEO GAME should. People like you complain and ruin the game for everyone else, panzi. Just play it, it’s just a game.
---
I'm concerned that the lead narrative writer from NV parted ways with Obsidian a while back and is currently busy with Dying Light 2. His presence may have been the only thing that made NV worthwhile, because it was otherwise mismanaged and as buggy as 76 at release. The studio management there sounds like a real clusterfuck, though it might improve (or get worse, I guess) now that MS have bought them out.
---
Yup. That's what I meant by non quest holos. Hehe
---
Yeah, one shot is the shotgun. But have you tried TSE Minigun? It doesn't do it in one shot, but it melts the room in a few shots. Normal version is ~4 rounds per second, TS makes it ~8 rounds per second, and each one explodes. You just go BRRRRRT, and the room is full of meat. The .50 Cal is pretty close behind it. Have you tried Harpoon gun with flechette mod, as TSE? Clears the entire room, almost like a shotgun.
---
I think you are focusing on one-shot too much. Even if TSE doesn't one-shot, this means non-TSE will DEEEEEEFINITELY not one-shot either. Except TSE will still damage nearby enemies, and non-TSE will not. 
---
By the way, combat shotgun is lowest damage per shot amongst all shotguns. So I'm not exactly surprised you can't get into one-shot range with one of those.
---
TS needed a nerf. Explosive needed a nerf. Both shouldn't even have been possible on the same weapon to begin with. 
---
It because of all the duck tape you have to use to get the mod on 
---
Dear god that is a hell of a quest for this to be happening on. That probably would have actually irked me. I was just casually killing when it happened to me. 
---
The nuclear fission generator is also quite clean 
---
Yeah... I guess I might be able to convince myself that this is the case.  Still, a bit irksome considering that this thing costs real world money.  :shrug:
---
And when too close people with rifles find themselves unable to make VATS shots.

I’ve been having this issue right now and it’s incredibly frustrating. Every time I use my pip-boy my game locks on and I can’t move or do anything. It’s really irritating. I’ve even logged in and out and it won’t work :/
---
I think ammo is a non issue exactly because of all the perks you can get for it. At a certain point, you don't need to worry about spending levels on crafting perks. I'm level 160 with 20 unspent levels. Most of the levels I did use we're for general utility or testing out other cards in the non auto perception tree. I was ideal well before level 100. I do think melee is ideal faster than ranged because of the lack of needing these utility perks. And we could really use a damn slider for breaking down ore and making ammo. I expect that to be fixed in a few months.
---
Still, what you spend in time and resources you gain in flexibility. Vats allows me to kill anything mobile. A scope let's me kill from long range. Hip fire accuracy let's me kill close range. Whitesprings is no issue because I am in there with the melee spraying the room with gunfire. 
---
Perception does have a bonus to guns. It may not be damage, but it is still useful. Perception gives us vats accuracy making it easier to kill at longer range. Melee doesn't need accuracy, so they get damage on STR. Ranged doesn't need damage, so they get accuracy on PER. Ok maybe they do need some damage, but we have tons of perks and weapon mods that do that.
---
In essence, I agree with you that melee is easier to get into and faster to reach that ideal build. Ranged takes longer, but has all the utility necessary to make it work and when it comes down to combat, what matters most, ranged is far more versatile than melee. It's also technically stronger per hit if you consider TSE but I try to ignore that considering the looming nerf.
---
You tell me if this doesn't sound pretty damn good. My handmade deals 92 damage person before adrenaline and before that 7% more damage taken CHR debuff. Tenderizer is it called? It has 85 in the clip and ignores 68% of armor. That is 7,820 damage before I need to reload. With that debuff, it's about 8,269 damage dealt.
---
The easiest way is to add them as a friend on your device.
---
If you click the social tab on the main menu, you can check if any of the group are on and join their server through this menu.
---
Or if no one else is online, you start the server and everyone else can join on you.
---
Unfair! Pistol players at disadvantage vs rifle users!
---
Or wait 30 seconds longer in the loading screen than being teleported back to the entrance of the enclave bunker because the game was busy loading in the robots and defense turrets.
---
If you relied on a crutch to do sqb then that is on you.
---
Pretty sure they do cause I eat TSE to the face with my assassin sentinel 
---
Most would consider it a waste of a nuke because of the lack of plants, thus no flux to harvest. Enemy wise though it sounds cool with all the catwalks and such.
---
Shit you did that on accident? 😂😂😂You even subconsciously mimicked Dog’s speech pattern. New Vegas was the best Fallout IMHO although I preferred Fo4’s gun play and build mechanics. 
---
I definitely did the bog radar sync stuff.  Did that as a low'ish level (25?) and it sucked!
---
dang.. i spent some time building here today and now i can't seem to get on a server where it will place.. i've hopped a bunch of times without being able to place it.. and i go to check if anyone is there already and it's always nothing.   So i figured maybe I built over something that I had picked up that was trying to spawn or whatever, so I just tried to move camp and now I can't place it down anywhere in this place :(((
---
I can't believe you touched my tra la la. 
---
Vampire explosive combo legendary weapons sometimes proc the healing twice...
---
Had a Vampire and V/Explosive Gatling gun.. so I can confirm double healing.
---
1. Cannibal(hp)/Corn|Razorgrain soup(food/water)
---
 \- silva homestead, west of it cooking pot next to river.
---
1. No
---
2. 0 - There are known bear/molerat/radstag etc spawns, so it you need a boost to a particular stat or for whatever else it's easy to farm. 
---
All of this obviously would change if we were allowed to place vendors at our camps.
---
I get the feeling the game plan for F76 will include something like this. Are mission statement is to rebuild the world. Not just the odd camp. So I can see quests/events leading to map changes and stuff happening down the line.
---
Yes. I relied on a crutch. A crutch i didn't have.  
---
Wait what?
---
Exactly so in the case of fallout 4 explosive did a base 15 damage as explosive, on a shotgun it did that to every pellet.  In 76 it does 100% base weapon damage as explosive (if im understanding it correctly) to every projectile fired
---
I launched my first nuke today, PS4, and was disconnected from server right after. Missed my own nuke. And my first! 😢
---
*Hasn't played Fallout 1, 2, or tactics, and doesn't feel good about 76
---
*Claims to be a diehard fallout fan
---
Yeah I'm trying to get away from power armor myself and try a unyielding/low health build out. Moving perks around can get weird to say the least.     
---
I'll look for you here in a bit, I'll definitely be on tomorrow for several hours if we don't manage to get together tonight. 
---
Indeed but if there was a host it would be a robot and id rather no host than codsworth all the time
---
That is what I am looking for, to see if there ARE specific foods that might be a market
---
This is but the proverbial tip of the iceberg.
---
I giggled.
---
I'm sorry.
---
I'll have to give this a shot then.
---
I saw someone nuke Morgantown a couple nights ago. It was pretty interesting. Also it led me to realize that creatures inside of buildings also get a radioactive upgrade. 
---
There better be Wastland Chimichangas too...
---
I play it like a survival game. Just scavving and try9ng to stay alive. You know,  pure lone wanderer mode. Very much digging it this way. 
---
I'm fine with 4 being the max as long as they are missile turrets.
---
&gt; Because really. Those TSE weapons were mostly the reason you were able to down a SBQ easily
---
Um... nope.
---
Your post illustrates exactly the reason to nerf TSE - apparently people have crutched it and don't understand how to play the actual core game anymore.
---
Rules of a Queen fight from day 1:
---
- Cripple her to reduce her damage reduction buffs in the air
---
- Beat on her and let all the level 20s with assaultron blades beat on her
---
- Use the cheapest ammunition you have with the most expendable gun for the first five minutes
---
- If it looks bad start clearing adds for xp and loot or leave
---
- Worst case scenario, find at least 3 other people that do more than stand around with assaultron blades
---
But what about second breakfast...
---
Hmm, my wife may have secretly seen this show.  She's been going through boxes of old shit...
---
Ah man, that just inspired me to make a chef.  I roll with a balanced main, and a team medic, wasn't sure what to do next until now.
---
That's usually how it goes.
---
I mean I'll take anything, but yeah. That's the one I'm eyeing. And the lever action rifle. And also, thanks mate.
---
Their CS is pretty bad. I had a bugged quest, which took 3 tickets before they reseted the quest. As long as you repeat yourself enough, they might help you.
---
Haha cant argue that
---
I saw someone do this before. What's the point of it? I stood with him and shot the ghouls but got minimal XP. It seemed like a waste of time
---
Oh yeah I use voice chat. The but about my phone was just to imply that the voice quality isnt the best
---
Thank you! Glad you enjoy! Hopefully one day your wife might give it a go and love it as well. 🙂
---
Canned Coffee. The AP regen is phenominal. Maybe carrying around 120 of it is excessive but man does it pay off (Marsupial + Speed Demon) when running from a horde of enemies to get to a point of interest without stopping to take a breath. Helps also when/if you have a jetpack.
---
I guess it's also helpful for those perpetually overencumbered so that you can keep walking without stopping for the AP to regen.
---
Agree with Harles. I've used it on melee and single fire rifle builds and it works very well.
---
True
---
Weird. 1st time I've heard your issue. Wish I could help.
---
Future DLC.
---
NV is a great game but it did piss poor sales wise and was just as buggy as the rest. BUT the story was really nice and in depth I'll give it that.
---
You're correct
---
did you even play the game?
---
Currently my character is frozen inside a nuke zone. I've had 6 bluescreens in the last hour and half. This game's servers just keep getting worse. They need to stop nerfing shit and work on massive stability issues first. Bethesda clearly is not listening or just doesn't give a shit.
---
Yeah I just don’t have anyway to play those 3. Though I really want to. Also I only shared the things I disliked in this post. I feel amazing about 76
---
I used Site Bravo today and only had one Mr. Gusty and one protectron come in the room during the prep. Are the silos different difficulty?
---
I'll be on tonight around 6pm EST, username is ascott38
---
I do have to meet up with a guy to buy a TSE gatling gun off him but will be available for whatever afterwards.
---
Well he certainly isn't Jamaican.
---
He played the game as intended so I'm not sure what the problem is?
---
It's also sold out and has been for weeks.  My aussie mates are waiting for it.
---
I‘d scream for a whole day and half of the next day 
---
That's why I have a "workshop" in the basement where I have a real life Fallout-esq horde of semi-organized clutter. So long as I fix things around the house that break I get my ~~kingdom of dirt~~ corner of junk.
---
Sounds good.  I'll be server hopping a bit tonight to get a few cores (5 50% cores just isn't quite enough)
---
But then they made the .50 cal hunting rifle mod, that literally had no purpose. It doesn’t pass the ketchup, it doesn’t download chrome, it does nothing. The base receiver is better than it in every way. It starts it’s life as a downgrade, and people who don’t realize that install it and waste mats. 
---
Yeah that’s similar to how I play and it’s really fun.
---
oops. not craftable. please disregard.
---
Sugar (craftable) can often supplement AP as well. I usually eat it when jumping in the air
---
I know one duper who got banned yesterday on XBOX he had 70 mil weight. Actually I know 10 who got banned. Some I friends I would have never guessed they had duped. Its funny. As soon as they were banned most said they were duping whereas when I'd buy something nothing was said. First person I know who got banned was 4-5 days ago
---
My friend got banned off fallout and he never glitched. He’s been in a different country for a couple of months and hadn’t seen any emails from Bethesda. 
---
Which is a great fix unless it’s a Level 90 Scorcbeast in a nuke zone. 
---
If you can't drop the sqb in 15 runs without tse then that is on you.
---
She has mechanics, learn them.
---
But it's pointless to suggest that if you failed 15 times and learnt nothing.
---
That’s f*cking painful. 
---
I’m pretty sure my controller would be firmly embedded into the wall if that had happened to me. 
---
Throwing a .50 cal round at someone would likely hurt worse than actually getting shot with a .308
---
Sometimes alt tabbing causes similar thing to me.
---
It says in stock?
---
For a game that has a lot to do with base building, we sure have limited building stuff 
---
So in other words you had to cheese her from day one already.  
---
Oh glorious.  
---
So what do we nerf next? Gatling laser? Ultracite weapons? Cryolator?  
---
Because this is exactly what happens right now. We nerf a weapon that got only common through dupers and cheaters.  
---
Or do you honestly want to tell me now you do not think it punishes people after spending weeks to find such a weapon, while a duper just runs of and gives it to everyone to make it look so absurd?
---
Sometimes I feel like people are now just being banned by association and people putting a ticket in just being assholes. Most of us being banned love the game, such a waste. 
---
Happened to me too this morning, I just turned the game off, had a drink and went to bed
---
Ish.  A tie table could vastly reduce the amount of data.
---
Itemid, playerid, quantity, condition multiplier, current condition %, affix group id, custom name.
---
Now the inventory table is static.
---
Lol, without vats you can't crit
---
We nuked morgantown a while back.  It was interesting, but the spawn rate and density of the spawns is no where near what you can get out of whitesprings.  That's why most people either do Whitesprings or FSP.
---
It would do less damage than the 10mm pistol. RL gun and bullet mechanics mean dickall to Beth in this iteration. 
---
NV was a massive improvement over 3 imo the big differences between Obsidian's and Bethesda's fallouts are
---
depth of story quests are better by Obsidian
---
environmental story telling is done better by Bethesda (imo that is, and with this I mean the 'show don't tell' stories you have to peice together and figure out)
---
If the two could get along and do a coop project of a fallout it'd be....amazing imo
---
Not really because there must be an exchange of damage to initiate pvp.
---
This means a melee player must be in melee range before pvp can begin.
---
Explosive damage users are at a HUGE disadvantage here as firing at this range would be suicide.
---
Checkmate.
---
Up your armor pierce stats, its not so much that enemies have tons more hp at higher lvls, but they do have much higher DR/ER values. So your 100-200 damage on a high def mob ends up only hitting for a fraction of what it would on an enemey with low DR/ER like scorched.
---
There is a perception perk that allows you to see a mobs DR/ER and the difference between a lvl 65 super mutant and a lvl 65 scorched are huge.
---
Anti-armor becomes fairly important as you get to endgame. Hope this helps.
---
you need ap for a proper sentinel/cavalier. no room for vats.
---

&gt; I feel like it just throws you into the world and wishes you luck
---
Why provide a cap? I would like that nuka cola crafting station similar to FO4. And instead of providing a cap  to prevent a cap generator, a Nuka-Cola or Nuka-Cola Cherry (or whatever, depend on the recipe) would be needed for base ingredient.
---
I, personally, think that is a great idea.
---
Cheese? What are you saying? You're arguing for a built-in mechanic while calling another built-in mechanic cheese. That's... not rational thinking.
---
I get you miss your TSE and it made you feel special. You'll still have it and it will do _slightly_ less damage. You'll be fine.
---
Nerf all of that stuff.
---
Some people actually play the game.
---
it’s because people are cheating to get it. You signed an agreement when you played the game that prohibits that sort of thing, or i’m pretty sure you did. If you’re exploiting the game, then you forfeited all right to be pissed when you get banned.
---
Nah. Fallout 4 was bad. 
---
All of the games do that but if you read on I said it doesn’t really give any actual direction
---
Super Mutants were created due to an experimental virus called FEV, a mutagen that alters the subject's DNA to make it mutate, that was made before the war. The American government together with West-Tek created it to make easy to control, highly-intelligent super soldiers that are resistant to radiation and diseases so that they can use them against China. Most pre-war experiments only created the stupid super mutants, however. These experiments were done on citizens of the United States. There are several facilities throughout America where FEV experiments were conducted, most notably Mariposa in California whose secrets have been uncovered by Roger Maxson who then went on to create the Brotherhood of Steel. Mariposa was later, after the bombs fell, rediscovered by Richard Gray who then perfected the FEV so that intelligent Super Mutants were possible. He then went on and tried to turn everyone into a Super Mutant because he thought he could prevent another Great War. There were other places were FEV was experimented on: Vault 87 in the outskirts of D.C., The Institute beneath the CIT in Boston and the West-Tek research lab in West Virginia.
---
Super Mutants in 76 make sense, it causes some minor plotholes tho.
---
Do you always only understand what you wan to instead of what someone is telling you?  
---
Again. I do not have a TSE. And i killed the queen a few times without a TSE too.  
---
Times where i do not kill a queen only started to become the norm once all low level players join the fight and stand around doing nothing but making it harder for those who try to kill her.  
---
If the only way then to counter this problem is by using a "crutch", then isn't that a pretty normal thing to do?  
---
Or do you run up to every crippled person who uses a crutch too and tell her they have to stop relying on those crutches and demand them to be destroyed?
---
It would have to be food that give really good buffs but yeah I can see it
---
People swore that they had fun in SoT. You can like the game all you want mate, but it doesn't change the fact that 76 is a festering pile of trash.
---
That mod really improved my experience with the game but the base issue remained there - that there weren't really any branching choices. 
---
Like ignoring Preston...
---
not op but I can make a montage if you want.
---
Thanks for the help everyone I have decided to go for gladiator until I get a deathclaws gauntlet then switch to iron fist
---
I know what you want to say. I have nearly same feelings like you but on opposite side. I wanted to wait some patches until game will be how it had to be. Now i can't come back to my 84lvl.
---
If not for him, would you mind explaining those mechanics to me?  I've read all kinds of things on the SBQ, and have tailored my build to be the best I can get for taking on the SBQ.  I've read about staggers preventing her from landing.  Among a great deal of other ideas (killing all adds to encourage her to land, etc).  The only sure thing I've come to realize is that while Just me and my friends (about 5-6 people) are able to drop her health CONSIDERABLY fast, like get her to the regen mark in 2mins or less, by the time everyone on the server shows up, we stop being able to damage her and fail.  
---
Our only successes are when the hordes of leeches fail to show up.
---
I would but im taking a break until they are done nerfing everything lol. 
---
How did they reset the quest? I might need this, my mistress of mystery quest is completely screwed over
---
Its not required.
---
I can use vats 10 times with 10 agi and a properly modded rifle. 15 with 15 agi.
---
in Charleston, there is a house you can look out the window of and it doesn't render anything except the landscape. 
---
Oh no, what I'm getting at is that that is basically my situation. I don't keep much steel on hand, but it's easy enough to go gather. But I stockpile the rarer stuff like screws and gears 
---
Sounds about appropriate lol
---
They'll probably nerf both.
---
And track ppl spamming bobbleheads.
---
They already track ppl picking up high quantities of any item
---
They're* and you can crit, it's called a headshot. You just dont get any bonus damage from perks or effects. Sorry that you broke your leg and need that crutch but hey, whatever works for you
---
Amazing! Thank you! 
---
Agreed with the other nerfs lets keep it balanced nerf melee too so everything is fair
---
Speed demon is your foul. I want to make an speed build too. I think speed demon is the problem. In a few days I test only the 3 Perks for sprint (Squad Maneuver, Gun runner, Death Man Sprint) it should give me +60% run speed. 
---
I mean in a way you’re saying exactly what I’m trying to. An event in fallout is a co-op event, yes. So you shouldn’t be able to kill each other, ok. So why did this guy get killed? Just turn off all forms of pvp during events. Not turn it off kind of but sometimes turn it on a little in certain scenarios for certain people.
---
While he does sound a bit like a shill, I am level 72 and also feel the same way. I'm lucky enough to have a solid group of buddies on every night, so most of my time has been in a party. I don't know how I'm going to go back to a FO game that is single player!
---
The only good cancer bat is a dead cancer bat
---
Excluding the OPs blatant negativity.  I'm looking for any info I can find to help counter the hordes of non combatants who blow her DMG reduction through the roof.  You're saying she gets a damage reduction benefit in the air?  Any other tips you have that might help?
---
I was so excited when I found one of those and then when I test fired it I almost rage quit for a little while. 
---

I'm getting short but frequent bursts of FPS dips on the latest patch (PC). Seems to happen every 8-10 seconds when traversing exterior areas. Driving me nuts.
---
Then the 10% damage from aiming effect works differently than the 50 DR from aiming.

I can't aim in a menu and it's giving me the bonus.  
---
Incorrect. A little damage ticks off when before PVP initiates. So you can still hang back and ping someone, and kill them before PVP even starts. 
---
the nerf is happening largely thanks to reddit. so I made a list of every little petty thing this community despises and am now checking the boxes multiple times.
---
What was the point of this system existing anyway? Why did they care about ~realism~ for this one specific thing in selling to robots?
---
The nerf Explosive weapons got was the nerf melee started the game with. Use blocker, it’s the same as fireproof
---
Nah. Weak ones never gonna survive long in any game. The beatifull art of gaming is about playing in games and then returning to them when those games are older. The art in this is about finding strenght to return to game that was at start bad and and with time was better. And now im trying to find that strenght, even tough this game isn't old in any way. 
---
Keep posting this in places for Bethesda. If there is multiple ways to reach max speed, there is no point in having multiple options that should stack. It's not mentioned in game or anything so it's false advertising.
---
I think the nerf numbers are spot-on, still allowing them to produce extra power without being the clear-cut go-to legendary weapons. Nerfing the ability to stack bobbleheads should be a consideration made separate of the TSE nerf (and should absolutely happen)
---
You dont get 3500 damage without stacking bobblegeads or magazines. Mine has max of 561 for quad explosive. Not sure where your number came from
---
Yeah, that's true. It was slim pickings after the initial rush. Fortunately the *Back on the Beat* event kicked off shortly after we cleared out the initial spawns. It was pretty interesting since Steelheart was still only level 14.
---
Morgantown is an absolute goldmine for Cobalt farming. 
---
Except for the same dark ironic humor, the art style, the world building, the writing, the style of questing and exploration, the combat, and the many trademark bugs and balance issues, sure, it’s absolutely nothing like a fallout game. :/
---
Nope thousands little bitch 
---
Haha too funny.
---
You've never ran a vats build have you.
---
I'll put it simply. Crits to the head in vats do more damage than non vats headshots.
---
Way more.
---
It allows a none legendary one shot most enemies.
---
How exactly? If you think 76 and 4 are both bad, that makes sense. But if you think 76 is great and 4 is bad then you have to be trolling. 
---
'
---
Every negative criticism applied of Fallout 4 applies to 76 but is  multiplied by 1000.   
---
There is no question of this.
---
Lol a weapon that game provided you to use is a crutch that's rich also the queen dies in one shot from an exploit lol but it's not the exploits fault? Are you secretly a melee waiting to hot dumpster fire on people? Besides Bethesda had to nerf her once already after we has tse so no it wasn't the guns fault jesus people already forgot the queen was needed hard because people couldn't kill her with op melee and op tse weapons gasp
---
Players too, I think it'can be used as a way to execute them.
---
Oh yeah, that was an issue for us... the event didnt show up... so there were groups inside those locked rooms we couldn't access.
---
And with that you showed me and everyone who has half a brain that you didn't even read the text.   
---
Otherwise you would be aware that i don't have a TSE myself.  
---
Let me guess. You also only did read and understood what you wanted to but didn't even try to interpret the reason why i did open up this thread?  
---
But i will make it easier for your kind now.  
---
My concern is not being able to kill the SBQ at all anymore, if the TSE nerf is this harsh. Simply because it is nigh impossible to do so already if no one uses one against her if all lowlevel players run in and either stand around or tickle her with a BB gun.  
---
Is it easier now to understand or do i have to draw pictures?
---
Someone nuked West of Grafton. Lots of plants for sure. And there was a spot with lots of scorched. They had a lot of mass, glowing and fluids. 
---
you need dodgy. as soon as it's down, you're dead. maybe less so now, but still.
---
I feel that so much.... 
---
Mole rats and rad scorpions have a tendency of teleporting instantly over land... as if they burrowed and resurfaced but the game forgot the time and animation of the burrow part.   
---
It’s kinda funny when mole rats do it, but it’s fucking terrifying when you’re sniping a radscorpion a football field away and suddenly it’s literally right in your face lmao.  
---
I dvr’d a video of this happening, maybe I’ll upload it later lol
---
All scorchbeast do. Go shoot one. Wait for it to land. Shoot it again.  They're all really squishy on the ground.
---
They've even nerfed SBQ to make her land more two patches ago.
---
Don't play favorites. All tjongs are good tjongs.
---
You're right I've never done a vats build, because I prefer to aim myself instead of let a computer do it
---
Yeah it’s moments like these that make the game infinitely better
---
I can make a cramburger, just checked. It's on my list as though it's been learned. I believe I have all the food/drink recipes.
---
You do realize that there is a long term investment planned to support this game for updating and balancing purposes. Sure, the game will never be balanced, as along as you introduce more weapons and such, but you're making it seem like Fallout 4 was balanced, however it didn't matter because you're playing by yourself, the only time you'd complain is when your favorite weapon isn't as good as others. 
---
However, the fact that you talked about TSE weapons like they're not currently being dealt with, for [more info](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/1pB3jkcq5unlYTB3TTURrZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-17-2019), is pretty much telling me that your intentions was to disagree for the sake of being a obstinate person without any supporting arguments to make a point. To add, you talk about melee weapons being overpowered, but you didn't seem to make any connection when I talked about weapon balance:
---
&gt; That's because small weapons are considered the jack of all trade weapons. They can be used for any situation. They also have the hidden benefits of allowing you to attack enemies from a distance and from spots that prevent the enemies from retaliating.
---
Which tells me that you didn't either bother to read my post to make the connection or, again, wanted to disagree to be obstinate. The way melee weapons work now gives incentive to use them. However, while you're waiting for the Scorchbeast to land, send my regards to your small guns.
---
Thatll be the next nerf mark my words 
---
Also, this is a reward from a quest... Belly of the Beast?
---
I caught one trying to kill a bloat fly so I dropped him.
---
Better than whiskey dick lol
---
I too get this a lot and I run party boy plus whiskey quite a lot. Can’t confirm if it’s related though.
---
coming from years of playing League, thats exactly how balancing works.
---
it can be 2 ways and 2 ways only:
---
a) you either buff everything (except for already op things)
---
b) or you nerf everything (except for already up things)
---
i remember when season 3 or 4 there were ALOT of complaints that all boiled down to "no fun allowed" meme
---
You never had that feeling where something tells you "you still have something to do some shit there" and then when it comes to menu you just think "no it's still have so much bugs that probably will be waste of time, maybe next time"? 
---
Beacuse i feel something like this. 
---
Welp, that's that then. I havent played in a while but I guess I'll free up some hard drive space now. Thanks for the info 
---
The way i was explained it was with a shotgun. No bobbleheads or magazines you do 500 damage. That is per pellet in your shot. Each trigger pull is one shot gun shell comprised of 7 pellets. If all 7 pellets hit that is 3500 points of damage on target.
---
For your quad if all 4 shells hit then that is 2244 damage. 
---
I requested help once. I got automated answer about them not resetting quests. I reopened the ticket and asked again. Still got the same answer. But third time was the charm. I demanded to get it reset, adding "my friend got it reset, i expect you to treat everyone equally". No answer. After next patch from that my quest was semi-reseted, like 4 steps back.
---
No real guide on what to read.  Only rule is to read something then repost it under a new, but similar title.
---
I used to always get a laugh when I'd loot a bathroom in the other fallouts to open the door and get shotgunned.  
---
Something about the vulnerability of needing the bathroom to have some fucker shotgun trap you at your weakest point.  Kind of disappointed with no toilet traps in 76.  
---
Huh, I hadn't thought to check inside the safe rooms for more enemies. I was too focused on keeping Steelheart form getting swatted by a glowing one, haha. 
---
And question is I shall. 
---
Know what's worse than not having NPCs? Having NPCs that either completely take you out of the game or make you hate them for abnormal reasons. I personally can't stand it when an NPC in fallout 4 repeatedly says the same thing.. sometimes multiple times in the same few minutes. I personally can't stand Piper. Or that whiny dude that hangs out in Sanctuary, etc. 
---
Fallout 76 does something Fallout 4 could NEVER do. I am truly in control of my story. I am not supposed to be on some hunt for my child (it's forced on you from the beginning). I could go help out with what the Overseer asked for, or I could do it in my own way. I don't have to be the hero of my story. I could be some bumbling tradesman, or a mercenary for hire, or i could join one of the various groups and not feel like I have to be attached. I could, for all intents and purposes, start a real or roleplayed romance with another person. 
---
Fallout 4 is a good sandbox. Fallout 76 is better because I can share that sandbox with others. Sure, there's glitches and other things. But the very thing people complain about Fallout 76 not having is literally the exact reason I like it. :)
---
I'm running an Unarmed / Slugger build using a Mutants Deathclaw Gauntlet, and for PA a Mutants Grognak Axe.   those 2 are my current max dmg melee's.  Hopefully i'll come across a bloodied one soon.
---
r/FO76 helped me tremendously with my [build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3568b8&amp;d=sb2i43a72s72l71lt2lu2a04c72c80er1eu0pe2ss2sg2se2s92ek1ir2id0&amp;w=sa1sm2sn2cr0i12ic4ii0ij2ik0a42au2el1s61c62p10at1lm2s42l92i30if2i50iq2&amp;n=)  
---
Bloody Mess is a must,  I noticed a big boost in dmg after maxing it out.
---
I like party boy/girl since you can drink a whiskey and get +4 strength (+6 if you max it).  And I wish i wouldn't have maxed out Adrenaline,  I pretty much 1 shot everything after 1 kill anyway, even with full health.
---
Mutations are where the game completely changes.
---
Here's what i'm running atm
---
* ^(Adrenal Reaction: - + dmg at low HP)
---
* ^(Twisted Muscles +25% melee dmg,)
---
* ^(Talons: + 25%  unarmed dmg)
---
* ^(Marsupial +20 crry wt, added jump height)
---
* ^(Scaly skin: +50 dmg &amp; energy res)
---
* ^(Healing Factor: +300% health regen)
---
* ^(Grounded: +100 energy res)
---
I had speed demon at one point, but accidentally cured it.  I may see if i can get it again, but i'm not sure if i want to trade off for more thirst and hunger.
---
Marsupial even though it has no dmg bonus is my favorite mutation by far, it's just fun.
---
After getting Twisted muscles and Talons I switched from 2 handed to unarmed and started bitch slapping everything HARD. I think i had a meet hook to start with faster swing speed or something and it was fairly nasty.
---
Unarmed is just fun, and ridiculously OP.
---
I hate PA now, and only use it when I need to jump in my excavator armor or in a nuke zone.
---
Having Scaly skin, Grounded, and Healing Factor along with some decent armor pieces has reduced my stimpack usage by A LOT.  
---
Before mutations i was constantly searching for them, now i have at least 150 diluted at all times.
---
Update us as you build,  i want to see what you think after you're done.
---
I'm specced to do significant rifle damage, so I usually drop normal SB in the air in a few hits... never noticed more damage on the ground.  I'll keep an eye on that thought, Thanks!
---
Any tips to help get her to land?  Clear adds, don't use stagger perks?  That about it?
---
It’s like r/porn
---
Its just so simple it’s not a thing. I don’t understand
---
Fun fact, no one has tested the damage difference of two shot shotguns vs 1 shot.
---
They have SEEN the one pellet difference shooting a wall but thats it.
---
BoS Heavy
---
Bos mod 
---
Hah, earlier today there was a level 5 with a bounty on him, and I approached him and asked him if he wanted me to kill him, because someone else might and take his stuff (I promised to not take his junk bag), and he agreed. I shot him and then cannibalised him to execute him, and he screamed to loud.
---
It doesn't really benefit anyone to try to call someone else stupid when you can't sort out how the game works beyond TSE.... And apparently without even having one.
---
Good luck calling other people stupid as we, you know, have no problem performing in the game but you showed up to bleat that it's now impossible for you.
---
You're definitely the smart one. You're gonna go far, kid.
---
Still have one? Haha 
---
Everyone keeps talking about damage like everyone is stavking other chems and bobbleheads. My highest tse does 961 max. Melee are hitting over 3k and can teleport and 1 shot. This is a slippery slope and soon it will be nerfed as well as everyone will srart complaining about the op melee builds. Enjoy while it lasts, soon everything will be nerfed.
---
It's just big boned. 
---
MAXIMUM PROJECTION
---
“Oh I’ll seduce you”
---
*slowly puts on power armor left leg* 
---
“I bet you’ll cave when I put on my chest piece”
---
Cant wait to give anthem a shot
---
What is your build out / play style? If you are melee unyielding.. if you are a sneaking sniper chameleon. It all depends. 
---
I treat it like survival with optional story so bugs are most thing. Also feeling of being defencless beacuse every single mob in the game is like sponge make me feel rather unconfortable with it. This is biggest wall to climb behind. 
---
It is a thing?
---
Also West Virginia is a +
---
They dont need to close a gap atm in pvp, *unless* they strike first in which case they still have only a small gap. So it still isn't super fair. Idc if melee gets nerfed, but dont talk like they have this huge gap to cover when pvp slap damage is done until they close the gap. 
---
And why are you on this sub?
---
Other than a source for your salty tears?
---
Go home trash panda your trolls are weak.
---
I always have can do perk up along with the good boy perk. The food I craft I vendor for caps so that I'm left with purified water, canned coffee, and canned dog food along with excessive amounts of nuka soda which fill up a surprising amount of health and refill some of the water meter.
---
Market wise I can see soups being a thing as it fills both food and water. glowing fungus soup gives rad resistance, alternatively it's stuff to increase carry weight like ragstag steaks.
---
Food and drink is not hard to make and it's pretty plentiful. Some people consume a lot at once just to get rid of the weight. When I'm in party I have philantropist up so I have the group give me a hug for two seconds while I eat two canned dog foods and three purified waters and they're all back up to full.
---
Yes, I am bad. I'm 76 years old and not as sharp as I was in my 60's when I played the original Everquest beta.
---
Most of the Perks mentioned here I've never had offered to me. We don't all get the same ones at the same time do we?
---
As to cores being everywhere, are you sure this applies to the pc version since the last patch? I used to find them all the time and, indeed, could wear my T-60 constantly but now they are so rare that I can go to known sites and server hop dozens of times with no luck.
---
My problem with the power station is not defeating the low level mobs, but with the time available and the rads without the PA.
---
To those who made real suggestions, thanks.
---
&gt; I don't need you either, but I keep you around
---
When just being bold doesn't cut it.
---
It only works with the vault suit
---
That's it. I find it a lot easier to ground any of them with a shotgun but I ran a rifle build for most of my play. VATS works much better on a grounded SB, too, so if you've got a VATS build burn up critical on her head when she lands.
---
The stagger perks.... I only really have a problem with those on big guns.
---
True from 15 lvl you mostly praying for lead and bullets instead of not getting hit. 
---
All the time today.  Performance has been atrocious.
---
Bigger issue than op weapons is bobblehead stacking
---
actually, if i dont get any positive response from bethesda, it will def. be my last game from them.
---
just leveled an alt to lvl 45. after 2 hours with this weapon it dissapears... nope this is not fun at all
---
 ^(Why)
---
not
---
# Zoidberg?
---
Ok you made me laugh! ±1
---
She has massive resistances in the air so by shooting her wings and crippling them she will land.
---
When on the ground she takes far more damage.  And if you keep shooting her wings she stagger and stay landed.
---
I've only seen it a handful of times but you can get her to land and keep her there till dead.
---
Unfortunately ppl just zerg her with melee and not keep shooting her wings.
---
Tormentor for rifles and enforcer for shotguns does it really well.
---
^(Why)
---
If the gun has a recon scope and a full stock and long barrel then you mod it to a reflex sight short barrel and short stock it also gets heavier. 
---
There was a terminal or note I read in my adventures that mentioned releasing a captive sloth into the wild.  I like to think that's how they were introduced into Appalachia.
---
What really is a big killer in this game is that the junks components has been decreased. For example in fallout 4 duct tape has 2 adhesive &amp; vegetable starch I think has 4. Fallout 76 duct tape and vegetable starch has 1 adhesive.
---
I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who'd like to think that their Fallout 76 character is somehow related to their Fallout 4 character.  I ended up with a more middle-aged design, so my 76 character is an aunt to the one from 4
---
Because in reality we aren’t geniuses and all our shit is held together with 5 pounds of adhesive. That’s why our guns break constantly.
---
Yes and I am oversimplifying both, but I am not overestimating damage, I was able to 2 shot a scorchbeast with a freaking war drum. 
---
I dunno if that's a bug per se, most other effects are like that.  
---
So like 2 shot for example, it only adds the standard receiver damage for the 2nd shot, so if you add say a hardened receiver you'll see the resulting damage is actually standard receiver + hardened receiver instead of hardened \*2.
---
I really wish there was a suicider perk or something so I could use them without a fat man.
---
Well when melee gets nerfed youll be back here ctlrying. Why do you think tse got nerfed? Cause everyone complained. Guess what they are going to complain about next? Melee op builds. Then it will be nerfed too.
---
Well that is certainly one way to twist someone elses words around to your favor.
---
If you felt insulted by my words then i apologize for it, but certainly i am sure that wouldn't make you understand the issue i am having either.  
---
Since you though seem to be omnipotent in killing a SBQ without a TSE and having the exact issue i was talking about with dozens of low level players joining in the fight to scale the Queen beyond any reasonable healthpoints.  
---
Would you be capable of making us, those who didn't had the chance yet to try different weapons from those they have so far, able to understand to do so too?
---
Oh man, Bear is really cool. 
---
I don't have time right now to post my whole backstory, but my character was a distant relative of Nick Valentine (the real Nick Valentine, not the synth)
---
Beth plz nerf, dick crits OP
---
No. 
---
If you have other games to go to instead and easily switch to that, you never really wanted to play Fallout 76.
---
If you can bring yourself to get to the menu you can bring yourself to play the game.
---
The game is in the best state it's ever been in to date. Still FAR from perfect but also not as annoying either.
---
I simply craft the healing salve. Not that I do t pick up stimpacks but with a stock of healing salve in my pack I don’t worry about not finding them.
---
I definitely agree on the flexibility part. It's nice. But a lot of the benefits are not particularly important beyond a certain point too. Like being able to kill anything mobile. Vast majority of enemies in the game will run straight in your face. You can just stand in the doorway and swing. Killing from range is great, but then you have to jog all the way to where the enemy fell and loot it. Melee kills close range better than ranged, and never needs to reload. And if you are right up there, with melee, spraying the room with ammo...why?! When you could just be melee, and not have to craft ammo, carry ammo, perk for ammo carry, etc., and just melee, if you're already in there with melee?
---
The principal difference between Perc and Str is that with 30 Str, you're doing QUITE a bit of damage compared to 5 Str. But when you're shooting a ghoul in the face, point blank, or multiple shots on the same target in VATS with Concentrated Fire (which you take anyway for targeted limb shots) you're already at 95% accuracy, even with 5 Perception. And going from 5 Perception, in that case, to 30 Perception, will not increase your accuracy OR damage. That's why guns in general cannot compete.
---
Perception also only helps VATS, it has no effect on manual shots. Which also forces you to use VATS, which isn't exactly great. For one thing, VATS likes to miss targets even when you're at 95%, and if the enemy is right in your face, it misses them quite a lot (my guess is the bullet comes out of the barrel, and if the barrel is already poking out of enemy's back, it misses). And secondly, VATS requires a hefty commitment in Luck to make it work. Melee works without them, though 2-5 Luck is mandatory for mutations.
---
But yeah, in general, gun versatility is great. Even my melee carries a Tesla just in case I need to tap something if I fall behind. 
---
Numerically though, melee is just ridiculously far ahead. I'm currently running a low-health unarmed build on one of my chars and it's just beyond obscene. A lot of this also applies to range, but not quite in the same way. As ranged, with low-HP, you can still get 20% damage from Nerd Rage, and Adrenal mutation. But melee gets that, PLUS 50% more damage from Twisted Muscles and Talons, which also provides a bleed. Since 80% of my HP is burned by Rads, Radicool gives me +5 Str on top of the default +15 Str. Four pieces of armor, each give +3 to all stats (except End) so I'm sitting at +35 Str. That's a lot of damage (and carry capacity!). And that's before alcohol, before Psychobuff, before glowing meat steak. None of which work for ranged damage. 
---
That's really the crux of the matter - damage scaling from Strength, and 25% damage mutations which stack (Muscles and Talons). It's why guns can't compete. It's bad enough by itself, but once you get these AND damage multipliers (like Bloody Mess), it just completely blows it out of proportion. Bethesda either needs to make Str not increase melee damage any more, or start giving guns bonuses. Rifle damage should go up with Perception, energy guns with Intelligence, pistols with Agility. That would help a ton. 
---
**Kill Zone**
---
I would like to see them tweak their KillvolumeZ. To many times I have went to claim a workshop only to find out that 1-2 enemies are trapped under the map with no way of killing them rendering the workshop unclaimable. They could fix this by raising the depth of the known **kill volume Z**. The down side is more times than not developers either dont add a **KVZ** or they use 1 zone for a entire map which makes scaling to different map depths impossible. 
---
**Events**
---
I feel like events need a faster refresh timer. I know events such as "battle bot" normally trigger when you reach the area but for the most part when I open my map to check the map is so freaking void of events.
---
**ENEMY SCALING**
---
I know this can be a tricky code to write but enemies that scale with the player level really adds a new level of difficulty 
---
I.E
---
Player level 20 monster level 20
---
P50&gt;M50 P100&gt;M100
---
The game is so void of actual challenge atm. Players like myself either find their self on the wrong side of the map as a low level geting murdered or you are end game around a hospital full of level 1-3 scorched
---
**AUCTION HOUSE**
---
As many people know auction houses are mostly common things in mmorpgs. It is a great way to shed that excess junk and make a little profit when you are offline.
---
**HUNGER SYSTEM**
---
I don't know about the rest of you but I believe the hunger system needs to be tweaked cause I blow through food and water like it is nothing and it seems like not even 3 minutes later my character is starving and dehydrated again.
---
**PACIFIST**
---
I am really hoping they will fix the pacifist system to where the person who activates it can not be killed by other players.
---
**WILDLIFE**
---
I know we already have forms of wildlife from wolves mole rats radstags and bats (scorched beast) Fallout has always been void of life when it comes to water. I remeber having to do a mission on fallout 4 where I had to go underwater and my freaking heart was racing! I just knew there would be a mutated shark or something in the water but there wasn't. I know water combat mechanics can be buggy but I wouldnt be opposed to see a 4 legged shark come walking up out of the water either or a giant octopus beefed up on rads.
---
**SANDBOXES**
---
All over the wastelands you will find board games that you can scrap for components and parts, But I think it would be awesaome if we could set up board games (mini games) in our camp and do co-op games. (I.E- red dead has 4 player poker)
---
**MUSIC**
---
I am not the first person to turn on the radio and go *wtf is this? What were y'all thinking?* I am not saying it has to be updated hip-hop from today's generation I am only saying it is supposed to be 2076 and you added music that was popular in the 40s.
---
**LOADOUTS**
---
It is painful having to constantly switch your perks around to do what you need. Or you do like I do and go to build a workshop only to get done and realize you didnt have constructor perk equipped. Or repairing armor and weapoms to go *Duh* I didnt have gunsmith or amorsmith equipped.
---
**INDIVIDUAL VENDOR CAPS**
---
One of the most frustrating things I have run across is vendors sharing the same caps. (I.E) enclave 200 caps Responders 200 caps. I feel like all vendors should have 200 caps. Granted this would be a ton of caps everyday it would be nice to not have to wait 24 hours to be able to finish selling junk eating up my stash box weight limit.
---
**NEW NUKES** **LORE SPOILER**
---
So for any of you reading terminals and journals you know about the hallucinogen gasses released during riots around posidein that transformed people into monsters. So I think having different types of nukes to launch that made enemies do strange things or transformed into something real crazy would be cool. Something like a hallugen nuke that instead of leaving behind a massive rad storm leaves behind a huge cloud that makes your character go crazy and hallucinate after being in it to long. (I.E) players no longer see players all they see after a few minutes is just monsters. The panic from most players would turn it into a massive pvp event.
---
**THE INSTITUTE**
---
Now I understand that F76 is supposed to take place before the institute was even dreamed of. However it is a live action game. I feel like a great way of progressing would be to eventually add the institute and the synths as if time is actually prigressing in the game instead of saying well this game is in the past and time never moved forward. Just by adding small features like that they could add old missions from your previous favorite fallout games.
---
**BASEBALL**
---
I always thought it would be cool if some one threw a grenade at you while you have a melee weapon equiped if you could hit it and send it back toward the player who threw it.
---
**VERTIBOT VS CARGOBOT**
---
There are few things in this game that seem to irk players more than being over encumbered. So one thing I feel would be a amazing feature to add would be a peraonalized Vertibot that you can actually fly around the map in. As well as your own cargo bot that can be used as a portable stash without having to throw your camp up every other mission.
---
**VAULT-TEK**
---
I always thought it was strange how you come out of a vault and yet despite knowing the shape the world was is they had no advanced weapons to offer you. This really just doesnt fit with F76 as this vault was supposed to hold some of the worlds smartest members, I mean after all look at the institute. They were essentially a vaulted community and their technology was light years ahead!
---
**Uninterrupted Party**
---
One thing that my friends and I dislike is if we are some where farming enemies and we server hop to get the next batch bam we have to stop and regroup and get every one re-invited to the group.
---
**DESTROYED STRUCTURES**
---
Something that gets me is regardless of where you drop a nuke the structures remain unharmed. And while I understand the server has a massive undertaking when a area is nuked from killing off enemies to spawning new ones. I think it would be fascinating if the buildings or lay out changed with being nuked. (Example) look at whitesrpings that place is nuked multiple times a day by now it should just be a bottomless pit. Not saying it has to be that drastic but imagine nuking whitespring amd running to the golf course not knowing what to expect as floors might be collapsed maybe a giant sinkhole has opened and has monster pouring out. I know this is a lot to change but hopefully the idea will be taken under advisement.
---
**HORROR**
---
There are many horror fans who are gamers. And idk about the first time you all encountered mothman but I know the first time I encountered him it was at night, It was dark and I about had a heart attack *ahhhhh wtf is that thing someone help me** and that is by far one of the most unforgettable moments I have had so far so I would love to see more scary night dwelling monsters that pop up and cause some real heart stopping moments.
---
**NEW FACTIONS**
---
While I love the factions currently available I would still enjoy seeing some new enemy factions spring up with storylines and missions or events. *I mean all that open world and no one survived?*
---
*TBC when I think of more stuff*
---
SON OF A BITCH I'm AT WORK!
---
I think there's some sort of lore explanation of them coming from the Garahan mansion. I usually just skim the notes and tune out the holotapes in this game so maybe someone else can verify this.
---
Lol, yeah, caps lock will show me how mature you are. Neat conversation.
---
Fire Emblem (the first one NA got) changes my life by mentioning that if you hoard item stat boost items, you never really get any use out of them. Now I tend to use them as I need them and no longer worry about needing two 99 stacks of elixirs for a rainy day, or 50+ stimpacks in case I run into trouble.
---
Which is why we can never have good things, too many damn crybabies asking for nerfs
---
Du
---
Du hast
---
Du hast mich
---
Du hast mich jaja 
---
Yeah it wasn’t a long time ago when I checked which was odd
---
Your right but melee has been able to do that since beta and tbh the basic hunting rifle can 3 shot most equal level mobs at worst but that sound like a mob issue not a single gun or mod issue. It should be fix exploits fix stability then adjust values or balance. And to the guy with the image post ohh your so cool man dang so cool how can I be edgy like you it's the interwebz right?
---
Confirming what i said. You don't know what you're talking about.
---
well, I'm on XB1... you?
---
heh, too bad last laugh doesn't work with mini nukes

I never did get the Handmade plans, but I picked up 2 in a row in a giant Honeybeast fight (BOS quest at motel).
---
Pretty much every gun breaks too fast. I want the F3/NV repair system back. Repair guns using parts from other guns of the same time, and I want to be able to pay caps to just repair it.
---
Help me
---
Sorry, if you don't understand how to play the game I can't help you. I understand it's difficult to accept that you're below average when other average people aren't sharing the same problems.
---
Keep practicing!
---
FWIW: my Phantom budget seemed to clear when my bass could not be placed because someone was already there and I went to a different server
---
Wish to double upvote.
---
Only on the hunting rifle really. A .308 combat rifle has barely less damage than a .50 hunting rifle, with much better DPS, recoil, no bolt animation every shot, and can use the same stocks and scopes.
---
No idea.  When I was in the prep stage, I got as far as all 5 robots out but I had more than a few assaultrons as well as protectrons and gutsy's at one point.
---
I work
---
Thanks man!  I really appreciate the info!
---
No I’m not, that’s the point. I’m trying to go about my business unless someone try’s to pvp me, then I’d at least like the option to defend myself and have a CHANCE at retaining my junk. And yea you do make caps from killing people trying to kill you but, again, for at least the third time, you can’t kill anyone who doesn’t aggro you so you can only kill people that knowingly risk dying themselves while trying to kill you. They need to make pvp either blanket on or off at events then this would solve the problem.
---
And isn’t that exactly what we wanted when we asked for Fallout 4 but multiplayer?  
---
With unyeildint armour you can get up to +15 on all your stats, plus add mutations and other perks on your armour you can easily break the 30s
---
Thanks!  I'm going to change my loadout a bit to get the VATs targetting to hit those wings and see if it helps.
---
What about the NPC that in the Dev room? You think they'll be putting him in the game too just because he was in the Dev room?
---
I'm already starting to miss those easy fights. I never used those weapons but I'm sure a few players on my servers did.
---
Two of my last three fights were really hard. The 30 minutes ran out with like 6-8 of us, my guns all broke even with "luck of the draw" so all I could do is melee the scorched adds, and the queen was still at half health.
---
Yeah but then passers by shoot your pets :(
---
From what I understand, the extra pellet adds 100% of the entire shotgun's damage with just that pellet.  So if a shotgun deals 80 damage with 8 pellets, each pellet it 10 damage except for the bonus pellet from two-shot which deals the entire 80.  This nerf would mean it only deals 20.  
---
I don't think that's the case. two-shot literally adds a 2nd projectile. I think they'll just add a debuff to it.
---
Funny thing I used licensed plumber and use pipe rifle and pipe revolver. It’s already been two weeks and I didn’t do any repairing on them. 
---
That’s awesome! 😜
---
&gt; uh, thanks, though, 7 mininukes. you ... uh...
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; ... bye.
---
That's polite. Whenever I do an event and see missiles/mini nukes added to my inventory as a "reward" it's more like...
---
#***HOLY FUCKING SHIT GET THIS USELESS BULLSHIT OFF OF ME RIGHT NOW WHY WOULD YOU THINK I WANT THIS***
---
&gt;melee weak
---
wat
---
I came upon a fella the other night, surrounded by scorched... he was clearly out numbered and over powered. I was pretty far away, but I have a sniper build with a TSE Lever sitting at ~1000 damage. I place a couple strategic shots in his direction and help him clear the horde. I had my chameleon armor on, so I don’t think he saw me, but he threw me a ❤️ and continued on his journey. 
---
They're balancing around PvP, so nerfing melee is the answer. It can still one-tap in PvP.
---
Sounds a lot like the survivalist from new Vegas honest hearts dlc
---
We know how Fallout is with adhesive. It's obviously 6lbs of duct tape.
---
The beginning seemed illogical and like sloppy writing to me. "You are the best, the brightest, and our hope for rebuilding the world BUT rather than maximizing your potential to succeed and letting you use Vault 76 as a safe haven/staging point, we will be shutting down all its systems and letting it decay. Best of luck out there in the unknown! Bye!"
---
Take your karma whore ass and get the fuck out.
---
I don’t hate the game but it’s in no way a really great one... even Bethesda has admitted that.
---
Seriously people like you ruin gaming.
---
I don't even notice the rewards half the time.
---
Then, the next time I try to fast travel...
---
&gt; Dafaq?  where'd I pick up 60 40mm grenades?!?!?!
---
Yup. Couple weeks ago a player tried to take one of my workshops and I one shot him with a non legendary hunting rifle VATS headshot. I don't see anyone calling for those to be nerfed.
---
People downvoting you because they're noobs who can't play a game without a OHK weapon that trivializes the entirety of the game. Lmfao
---
you seem to be over reacting 
---
LoL as I said it's in for testing. Testing weapons and such such as his name  "wooby" would indicate he is a mannequin in the room for testing. Also lunchboxes had the Atom shop logo next to their names in the dev room,but I guess you don't care about that. We'll see. 
---
How are you getting that explosive will add 120% damage? It will only add 20% or 40% with demolitionist. And if combined with twoshot the increase will be 50% or 75% with demolitionist. You won't need to think about running either of those perks in PvP because you won't die quickly anymore. Base armor reduction will already make it quite surviveable. I can still 1 hit you with any bloodied build at all, the game will still be who slaps first will most likely die.
---
PvP has always been shit in the game, it just got slightly shifted when tse went wild in the game and its just going back to how it was before tse. The biggest effects that these nerfs have are on PvE content, people will go back to praying SBQ lands, people gonna complain about bullet sponges, pistols will continue to be lack luster, etc. Bloodied will remain uncontested as king now, with anit-armor/instigating stealth being viable (quad, Vats crit and vats refill will be viable too but needs all 3 together). All other prefixes will remain kinda useless. The good nerf would have neen to isolate the 2shot and explosives, stop demolitionist from affecting it, and buff other shit legendary prefects to a useable level.
---
I agree nerfs were needed, but not such drastic ones. While yes they can buff them into the right spot afterwards, it'd require the slightest effort to get it close to "just right" from the beginning. Bethesda likes to say that they're listening to the community but it seems like they only read the titles of the thread. Cuz not once did anyone suggest "hey lets nerf two shot to 1 1/4 shot and explosives to 20%".
---
Thats what you say until they do nerf it all, this is just the beginning.
---
When did you last do this? This was updated on the last patch a month ago. 
---
Plus that 100 energy is the jizz
---
Responder giantpunda your words now made me thing about our role in universe. I'M READY! I'M READY I'M READY! 
---
First and foremost - Do. Not. Neglect. Crippling. Perks. Sometimes the queen stays down. Sometimes she doesn't. But better than not giving it a shot 
---
Anyeays:
---
L: 15 - Better crits, crit savvy, and the mutation perks for sure. I flip flop between bloody mess and grim Reapers sprint. The former obviously helps with damage output but the latter? Fantastic Trash mob elimination when combined with...
---
A: 12: Gun Fu and Adrenaline. Works even better if you have a VATS cost reduction legendary. For the most part it skips over players if I have pacifist on. When it stops on the queen I blow the rest of my vats load on her. You'll approach double damage + stacked criticals if things go your way, and you can still do this with even a modest one card investment in adrenaline. The other cards? Your preference. It's largely 12 to give VATS points.
---
P:9 - I'm not here to debate commando vs rifleman. But I get more mileage from commando. Others find a rifle legendary they love and go wild there. Regardless Concentrated fire and tank killer. 
---
Other points - adjust to personal preference. Don't neglect Tenderizer in charisma if you can fire fast enough to utilize it. 
---
You could...maybe...pull this build off with a VATS efficient heavy weapon but I haven't had a lot of success. 
---
This build has it's pros/cons. This build is VATS reliant so if you have a problem with that then it isn't for you - at which case you're most likely gonna want to walk the melee and heavy build routes. You'll need some preparation to make it work.
---
But as advertised, it kills the queen good with a non TSE handmade (mine is anti-armor for full disclosure with VATS enhancement...but I can still do this with a one star handmade just fine) and it even kills trash mobs while doing it so all those...optimization challenged players...slowly hitting trash mobs with their melee weapons...can stop blowing a minute killing a single scorched and maybe chop off some queen health. Maybe. 
---
Never lost a queen fight. Even when flanked with level 40s-70s that clearly have never experienced this fight before. 
---
...Minigun has the same damage as the LMG IIRC. Sure you're not thinking of the gatling gun?
---
Is this the very northeastern corner of the map?
---
He isn't a mannequin, he reacts to being shot. They wouldn't have written his coding to react if he was just a mannequin.
---
Giggity giggity goo 
---
They said they'll reduce the TS dmg from 100% to 25%. So it can be interpreted as they reduce the same effect. No way can it be a buff, maybe shotguns dont suffer as much as others, but it's not a buff.
---
I definitely wouldn't fault Bethesda Austin for this. This is an engine that they had to completely overhaul to even get it to work online - it's a miracle it works as well as it does. And these are devs that more than likely have very little experience with the Creation Engine. I think that more than likely it was a combination of this engine being used for online that was built with ZERO intention of ever supporting multiplayer, shifting development to a studio that's not nearly as well-versed in the Creation Engine to tack on the multiplayer component, and corporate rushing development to meet some kind of arbitrary deadline.
---
On size of building next to the workshop i think. Been there only once
---
Nope. This one is right near the vault
---
I don't see how. I'd even say there's incentive to farm any longer, effectively killing the end game "content"
---
Depends on the Pet, for some reason Death Claws are marked as hostile, but I know, for a fact, mirelurk kings are flagged as neutral
---
is the sky falling? do we need to turn to allah or perish? 
---
Yes because it takes so much practice getting a good weapon in a looter shooter type game and use it against a boss.  
---
Well you had 3 chances now to go on and act the "proper" age you are supposingly try to have, but instead you gone the lowest level route and not accepted that people encounter a problme in a game.  
---
Again. If you would have really read the topic, you would have noticed that i even said myself that they should just split up TS and E, since that is what really scales it into absurd levels especially with bobbleheads.  
---
So i am not really completely against the nerf, i just think it is tackled the wrong way. You failed however to realize it. I mean you even failed at reading the thread and understanding the issue i am pointing out.  
---
That someone feels just insulted when people don't even try to understand what he really means, then you surely can be insulted too for doing so.
---
If you can slot in Batteries Included then you can carry "like not sure but probably over 200 since they stop updating the counter at 99 and I don't care to count them all" cores like me.
---
Yeah but the minigun has 500 rounds, good accuracy and an insane ROF. So that justifies the low damage
---
Lol instigating is fine. Hit the queen with an Instigating and let us know the dps since you're not gonna get the first hit
---
The hell is a 10mm DMV? Are you so triggered by the quest you wanna shoot it up?
---
Many people on this subreddit think this game is not about realism. It’s easy way to justify unfinished balance. So this nonsense with weight is one of the many
---
Lol smg
---
Yes...that was in my post but as a spoiler so that people could discover it themselves too -_-
---
&gt;Note that Sprint speed is a different thing I have not tested 
---
Can you test it for us? 
---
Oh, sometimes my handmade breaks. A point or two in lucky break sometimes works and sometimes it doesn't. Be ready to take a mid-fight break. Know where the weapon repair station is near Fissure Prime
---
Sounds dank I'll check it out
---
ok man, we'll see what gets introduced with the next few patches. why would they work on those in the latest patch, adjusting bonuses they provide if they didn't want to introduce them? 
---
I hate when my wife gets into purge or organize mode. She's a pain in the ass to the whole family.
---
Making separate budgets isn’t a solution at all IMO.
---
Turrets taking up so much space has to be a technical issue, because if they could just have flipped a switch this whole time they deserve so much backlash.
---
By making separate budgets you decrease our flexibility to build how we want because the max budget allotment is technical, not balance.
---
Just keep practicing! You'll get better. The game has changed, but only slightly, and with practice and learning you'll also be able to perform at an average level.
---
You'll get there.
---
When I've mass dropped junk, sometimes I got the message you would get when dropping an atom store painted armor piece.  Not sure if the game could be getting Co fused and dropping stuff in other tabs?
---
This game hates being overloaded.  A lot of things break when there is a lot going on.
---
You're asking this to someone else, but stuff it. I hate 76 and am in this thread, so I'll answer it myself.
---
That's like asking "if you hate creationism so much, why are you in creationist threads, arguing with them?"
---
Let me put it this way. I've always been more into the Elder Scrolls series and over the years, it has been dumbed down quite a bit. Even with all the dumbing down, none of TES franchise has gotten anywhere close to the flat up broken state of 76.
---
You need to mod Bethesda titles to make them great, because of their many, many flaws. I for one \*do not\* want to TES VI be a broken piece of shit because Bethesda's too bloody inept to do their damn job. That is the reason why 76 still attracts all this crap. Because Bethesda needs to learn that this shit isn't on. Fallout 4 could barely be considered an RPG, it ran like trash, the textures were muddy and don't even get me started on terrible AI and you being given power armour right off the bat. Even with all of Fallout 4's major issues, 76 is infinitely worse than 76. That is how bad 76 is.
---
I'm here because I don't want to see TES franchise get the same treatment as recent entries in the Fallout franchise. I actually like TES and I don't want it to be smeared in shit, due to Bethesda's complete and utter failures as a dev.
---
r/subsifellfor
---
Rock out with ur excavator out
---
The balance issues have existed since Fallout 4. 76 just made them worse.
---
Not seen that entry, but coulda missed it, I went there originally for a particularly pretty gun and was very, very disapoint....but did notice that they had a 'weapon stand' container set up so...maybe we'll be able to display guns in our camps in the near future?
---
Especially if it works like a workshop and you can pay caps to rent out vending machines or robot vendors for a session 
---
Now I have to watch it... Thanks buddy

To be fair, they wouldn't be so popular if everything else wasn't so terrible/niche.
---
Honestly, they should nerf the damage AND remove Demo Expert from buffing the effect. 
---
Not my spreadsheet. Watch the video linked in it. I dont think it matters that its a month old
---
Honestly if I were more motivated, I would draw Quagmire as a ghoul. 
---
I.e. ghoul with tattered Quagmire outfit and an oddly  large, yet believable chin. 
---
If it's like the Vault Tec one, it dumps the smoke below it.
---
I concur "melee weak" wat???
---
I haven't used turrets in my camp so I don't personally know. I know that launch prep can be rough when the chiefs are nearby since they are friendly and detect me easier.
---
Yeh i feel like the map should change and evolve by the different areas getting larger and smaller and more volatile and maybe key story added with maybe an event where a nuke is launched and causes a new storyline or something
---
350 fully perked os nothing compared to other builds
---
Not necessarily. If you go A, it leads to power creep. Elder Scrolls Online did this, and power creep got out of hand and trivialized 95% of the game's content. If you go B, it works, but sometimes increases difficulty too much for an average mouthbreather.
---
Ideally what you want to do is sand off the peaks and fill in the valleys in your balance. If something overperforms, nerf it (sand off the peak), if something underperforms, buff it (fill in the valley). This way you bring the unbalanced (both overtuned and undertuned) elements closer to the base line. It also reduces the sheer volume of work that needs doing. If 1 item is too strong, and 999 items are weaker, bringing 999 items up is a lot of work. But if 1 item is too strong, 1 item is too weak, and 998 items are fine, then nerfing one item and buffing 1 item will even the balance. 
---
Lol worthless because it will be hard.
---
Heaven forbid anything is difficult right.
---
Awesome!  That build sounds great.  I'll look into tweaking mine a bit, but honestly it's pretty similar.  Except for the use of rifles over commando.  Honestly, I just love the lever rifle, but I use a handmade as well (I'm going to swap it's drum magazine for an armor pen one).  And yeah, all my weapons are legendary, TS, TSE, anti armor).
---
One major misunderstanding I found out today is her higher damage resistance while in flight... I'm going to get concentrated fire re-equiped tonight and see if I can't force more landings out of her.  That should improve my success rates.
---
Thanks for taking the time to write that all down!  It's really appreciated!
---
GTA players thought in the same way until it turned to loading simulator
---
Not sure, but i know if the right one dont a-get ya, than the left one will
---
Well, I would keep up with updates on the game. Maybe later content will help pull you back and you'll want to stay.  
---
Tell us how Support handled your case when you get a response 
---
So what's you experience writing code and building programs. You're implying its all click boxes they use for making changes. Which is wrong.
---
Are people really having trouble finding adhesive? I have like 20 bulks of it and have to remind myself NOT to pick anymore up.
---
Wait do battered ones not yield screws?
---
Yes it does. The game only uses 2 decimal places for junk weight. So it rounds up **for display purposes** (but the engine still tracks proper weight). So your numbers are almost certainly wrong somewhere because of that and the data you gathered is pretty useless as a result.
---
You see? This is the only thing i am really afraid of now.  
---
Because this will become the norm once TSE "cheesing" isn't possible anymore when all low level players join in.  
---
I don't mind if there is only TS or E then as long as they still do what they are supposed to do.  
---
Heck i sit there often with my Furious explosive Cryolator and hope it doesn't break during the fight just to hold her down on the ground after using my Enforcer to take her out of the sky.  
---
I know very well how to fight the queen normally. People just assume that i must be "crying" about the heavy nerf coming to TSE weapons because i use one myself, while i do not even have one.  
---
I wanted one, but i guess that is pretty much redundant to do.  
---
Now i am just afraid that even killing the SBQ (Which is still some fun mind you) being impossible soon, since with every low level player joining in the fight and standing around trying to leech on the loot, the chances are dwindling further and further away out of control of those who seriously fight her.
---
Yeah, needing to dump hundreds of rounds to kill something is totally fine. Especially when a Semi auto uses less ammo and does it faster...
---
I like your suggestion to make the Mutant's effect more interesting.  
---
I too would like to see something else done with mutations but not necessarily making certain ones mutually exclusive.  I think it could be fun if they just interacted with each other more.  Maybe both.
---
Consider, as an example, the option of gaining the Bird Bones, Eagle Eye, Egg Head, and/or Talons mutations and instead of just giving you the normal benefits and penalties it combined them into a new bird-like mutation.  
---
100% all American clean and absolutely safe nuclear  Power juice 
---
Now can only use plasma weapons just to say this.
---
That's nutty. I'm planning out a Bloodied 2H Melee build for my gf and just trying to know how to best min/max. This helps, thanks! 
---
True, and if I remember correctly any time I forgot to swap my perk load out back to 3/3 x3 rifle perks + demo expert the damage was garbage. 
---
How about 10 crashes in 3 mins in Xbox 1 
---
Time will tell.  I hope I'm wrong but I get a feeling this will be a "told ya so" moment ;)
---
Untill events can give more than a 1 star legendary, none of them are worth the effort, unless you need purified water.
---
Are you the scientist that made the holo tape found in Big Bend Tunnel?
---
13 upvotes for a point made.  2 upvotes for a more accurate version that paints a better picture of said point.  This reddit in a nutshell :P  
---
But yeah, pvp areas should have a draw to them, like workshops.  The guys on this sub however, seem to think that killing someone at a workshop is "mean" not "gameplay mechanics" lol
---
Its crazy how the community is coming up with better solutions. It makes me wonder about the people making decisions. It just seems out of touch. 
---
even if that's correct, if my guess in the op is right it would go from a 100% max damage bonus to 300% which is still a net buff.  
---
I hope I'm wrong, but will laugh if I'm right ;)
---
It's rough in the beginning, but after 30 I started passing it up too. 15 bulk myself with another 100 loose.
---
Put the materials in your stash
---
350 is just right
---
Question on how it'll work.  The first shot, the explosive effect does 20% of that damage.
---
The second shot will be 25% damage, will the explosive damage for it be 20% of that 25% damage?
---
Have you tried borderless window? I think that helped my fps drops
---
That is such a badass picture
---
It’s like we are evolving from savage ash creatures into fleshy fueled far out fanboys.
---
I am following this topic too
---
I am curious as to see if your theory is true 
---
 2 accounts
---
So dramatic.
---
Tree fiddy is good
---
Unless you got two separate PS4 the only way is to third party 
---
I was lucky enough to find an anti armor combat shottie this week.   It was only then I realized there wasn't a specific perk for shotties.  I'm actually using it now to use up my all my shottie ammo, b/c it's farily viable with the anti-armor and skeet shooter.  About to add enforcer to my rifle build haha.
---
Great info - thanks
---
Well just wait for the melee berf youll be saying the same
---
I wouldn't say the scorchbeasts need to be nerfed, but they definitely need to be fixed. I could be wrong, but I dont think they're suppose to nonstop fire automatic rays out of their ass at you.
---
Grind until you get a good legendary drop.
---
Bethesda Nerfs the legendary that you get.
---
Start over and grind until you get another good drop.
---
He's wrong by the way. He's using Pack Rat 3 and he doesn't know that it rounds numbers for display purposes (but still keeps track of actual weight). So basically all those numbers are off.
---
Mhh..  
---
So once i am at your level then, i start trying to deny others to get to that point too by demanding nerfs to everything that got you there in the first place?  
---
Got it. :)
---
If you actually watched the videos you'd know that the only thing you get from the lunchboxes is a buff that makes enemies explode in confetti. What reason would they have to code that effect into the game, and not any of the p2w buffs you keep talking about?
---
Yeah 2 accounts. Doesn't mean you need another sub to Xbox live as long as one account on the box has live they all get it. But I suppose your issue would be only having one Xbox..if you ever need help transferring between chars shoot me a message. GT tiptoebaggins
---
This is how I’ve been trying to play, use the cryolator to keep her slow and let everyone just wail into her, and then once it breaks rush in and try to beat her down before the freeze wears off. 
---
You're welcome. Hope it helps. Lever action is suprisingly VATS efficient so you can give it a roll using this strategy though you may need a small stash of quantums and Max AP / AGI boosts.
---
Also, get tormentor or get a friend with tormentor in the fight and see if you can get the queen crippled. If she actually goes down, the melee mobs can actually kinda help.
---
Great, gl! Also if it wasnt clear you need all 5 pieces of unyeilding to get the +15 boost. It works well with bloodied since you need low health for both bloodied and unyielding. 
---
I also reccomend getting all the mutaions possible with class freak to really max it out. 
---
It doesn't except for lead and aluminum. His results are due to rounding errors because of pack rat 3 (it displays only 2 decimal places but still tracks all decimal places for actual calculation).
---
That’s too bad. But I figured as much. Thanks for the clarification!
---
What a bunch of pansies.
---
Let them nerf everything to the ground!
---
Real players just use their fists. Naked. 
---
Well, it sort of does. It's very economical. Keeping myself stocked on .308 isn't always easy. But keeping myself stocked on .50 is easy.
---
Like I said, .308 is 5/8/12 for 12 rounds. So, for 1000 rounds of .308 you're talking 417 gunpowder, 667 lead, 1000 steel. By comparison, .50 is 12/10/40, but crafts 200. So to  get 1000 rounds you need 60 gunpowder, 50 lead, 200 steel. See the difference? 417 vs 60, 667 vs 50, 1000 vs 200. If .50 cal did as much damage, or more, as .308, then .308 would be completely obsolete. 
---
In short, .50 receiver is your ammo saver. When Super Duper procs on your .308, you get 12 extra shoots. Big whoop. When Super Duper procs on your .50, you get 200 extra shots. Even with reduced damage, that's a lot of extra (free) shots. Same with .38, you just trade even more damage for even cheaper ammo (3/6/12 for x18). 
---
It's a weird way to balance it, and one I don't agree with, but it's the only way I can make sense of it.
---
You know what RadAway is good for?  Selling.  Keep some on hand, but yeah, 40 is a lot.  
---
right now yes. if you actually read the datamimed changelogs you'd know that they will provide much more than that. but i digress, you don't want to believe it and i don't care, so this is a waste of time. 
---
I use vats and know if it is him or not
---
It would be limited to the server, so 25 people at most. I’d think that would alleviate a lot of the issues that are in games like Wow.
---
I just killed her last night. Crashed twice during the fight (and once more during loading in from a crash). Actually made it back to help finishing her off. Got the quest completion rewards, finishing off adds waiting for her loot to show... 
---
Crash again. Now when I load back in I don’t have “looting privileges” on anything. 
---
FML :(
---
The extra weight is the extra missile?
---
Take your time and enjoy the game. 
---
People on reddit are often pretty helpful and would be more than willing to party with you to either give you stuff to might even hang around grouped to help answer any questions you have as you play without spoiling any surprises for you. A lot of us find ourselves playing solo a lot and we could use the diversion. What system are you on? 
---
When you step out of the vault \*spoiler\* to the right of the entrance (body = first gun and first aggro'ed robot shooting at you) down the stairs from the entrance (body = first melee weapon, quest progression)
---
Caps are instanced for you per each faction vendor and replenish on a 20 hour timer. If you are planning on buying from a vendor that is pricey, sell first since the 25% of sell value added to the vendor caps won't go over the 200 cap limit and are lost.
---
There's no reason to compare yourself to me personally or even assume I have an unfair advantage. That's not healthy.
---
Taking some personal responsibility is the first step. Start practicing. Learn the interactions in the game.
---
You'll become an average player someday even though you feel hopelessly mediocre right now. Just work at what's important to you, but don't focus on assuming that the rules were created to punish only you. Again, it's just not healthy or even rational.
---
You can do it!
---
Queen in 2 min with melee?  Maybe with 500 bobbleheads 
---
I don't think Egg Head should be included in that list, as I always view egg head as giving one the 'little green men' type head, but I do wish that mutation had a visible model change, like bird bones cause your character to have visible feathers sticking out of them in specific areas, marsupial changed legs to be digitigrade, talons made your character had pointy fingers, etc. etc.
---
Also: if/when vaults open, if human npc are introduced, it would be interesting if they treated you differently dependant on how human you were, more mutations leading to different treatment, like any of them being a bird lover would get positive disposition as you get the bird mutations, etc.
---
In most situations yes. Problem is the armor system in this game overly favors high damage, low rate of fire versus low damage and high ROF.
---
With the perks I've picked, 3 star super sledge I've got for her, and a mix of unyeilding/bolstering armor this is what the end results would be. On paper it looks insane I think. Just needed to verify that there was still benefit to SPECIAL stats going that high.  
---

Medium range anti-armor and tse weapons solve this quickly lol
---
Ah thanks senor. You get +1 internet.
---
Any idea why this is? I don't remember that being the case for other power armor pieces.
---
Fallout 76 Wiki says:
---
"Bulk
---
Raw materials can be turned into bulk versions at a Tinker's workbench. This costs a set number of the involved raw material to be bulked, plus two plastic to wrap it. There are only two materials that will reduce the weight of a junk item in your inventory or stash when compared to their non bulked counterpart. These two are aluminum, which will reduce the overall weight by 0.5, and Lead, which will reduce the overall weight by 1. Plastic technically experiences a weight reduction, but 2 of the 12 are consumed in the crafting recipe, leaving you with 10 plastic, which weigh the same unbulked."
---
you can rejoin the same server if you have a friend in that server. you can hide your gear in any world container and hope nothing crashes, rejoin your friend with your alt, and pick up your cache. yes still involve 2rd party but at least you don't bother them.
---
Reminds me of vanilla wow raids
---
They should just make fast travelling to wanted people free. It's a bad idea to not let them fast travel because no one goes after 10 cap bounties and they'd be stuck in a shitty situation. 
---
i just posted it
---
Mine bought a whole bunch of little organizer totes :/
---
No I have no idea to be honest
---
Thanks for that! I'll hunt for it there!
---
Can you tame any animal? Can Mirelurk Queens be tamed? I assume Scorchbeasts can't 
---
You are about dumb as a rock.  The problem isnt I got nuked, its that I couldn't even respawn and had to quit the server just to log back in minus my junk that was impossible to retrieve because I COULDN'T EVEN RESPAWN.
---
Quad refers to maximum ammo capacity  
---
Yeah, the receiver TYPE matters more than the ammo type. Like .50 does more damage on same receiver type but hardened just does more damage than say refined.
---
More of a fan of Baker Dtreet myself
---
Now that the best weapons in the game are being nerfed......
---
What weapons am I supposed to be excited about?
---
They have no clue about MMO's ...using the old bethesda engine and tacking multiplayer on to it doesn't make an mmo.
---
If anything they should cut the servers down to 8-10 people and treat it like multiplayer in borderlands would save a lot of hassle and effort etc, would lower expectations and probably help a lot with there crappy servers. 
---
Add in being able to pick between PVE / PVP servers and private and public. Could even go the other way like ARK and Conan etc and make it so you can server hop but need to make a new toon on the new server.
---
They need to do something though, if the games in its current state in 3-6 months it could start causing Beth long term problems especially as its still labelled a MMO.
---
I like how a "Two Shot" weapon is now basically just a 1.25 shot weapon. 
---
10/10 wouldn’t recommend
---
the real question is why does one round of 2mm EC weigh as much as 20 rounds of 12.7mm
---
Aren't you launching too early? Wouldn't you be better off showing off at least something substantial before advertising the site?
---
Oh wait... This is a performance art piece emulation the path that Bethesda took with the launch of Fallout 76, right? Launched too early with a lack of decent content, no NPCs in sight?
---
Clever.
---
pc, camp rebuild, most my stuff are dupped again, this time x2, like all my benches
---
This is pretty solid advice. I think I would only mention that they can rank up a special point and pick a card from an alternate pool. It's helpful to know that at early levels
---
Damn maybe I should use those. Two of my main weapons are pipe guns.
---
Hahaha I wanna see someone beat that lol I have great internet just the game itself 
---
If you're saying it's unnecessary for the game to load your stash when you try to craft, I would strongly disagree
---
5 pounds of glue
---
You can have as many different food effects active as you want, but the same effect doesn't stack multiple times... If you use a deathclaw Wellington for 3 str, then eat a deathclaw steak for 2 str, you will end up with +2... That also means that lesser effects can override stronger effects. 
---
Well I think you make some great points but I still feel the biggest weakness is moving in range to engage. It sounds like most of the damage you can do is overkill on anything except a scorchbeast queen.
---
Also I thought bonuses from special capped at 20? You still get damage bonuses beyond that? What is the cap actually?
---
I've killed sqb with none explosive guns.
---
Just have to think not mindless zerg
---
I keep hearing this “if they put this much effort into fixing bugs and crashes” like those are just a matter of adjusting some numbers.
---
More nerfs! Seriously though, its the same for me.
---
No, not at all. The pvp mechanics are already intrusive enough without directly taking away game functionality
---
Im trying to set this build up and still getting my ass handed to me; then again, still missing the agi perks and two nerd rage ranks. Are they that critical to the point Id see a difference after getting them?
---
Hahaha it's very amusing to me how many people use WOW references. Myself inuded.
---
Certainly seems like you care. If you didn't you wouldn't be so adamant about being 'right'.  I just don't understand why they would code one effect to work and not the other efdecta even if the lunchboxes are only available in the Dev room. It just doesn't make any sense. Maybe they thought about putting those buffs in lunchboxes and making them available for purchase, then saw that nobody wanted microtransactions that effected gameplay and they just left it in the code?
---
To allow you to sell these items, without making them cost a minimum of 1 cap each. If you could sell something like Wood or Steel at a 1:1 ratio of caps, it would be *far* easier to drain every vendor of their caps just by selling the most common scrap. With bulking they can value scrap at lower cap values, and it interacts with value modifiers from charisma better.
---
1. Yes
---
2. Yes
---
3. Yes
---
4. Yes
---
Yeah I was trying to do it right the first time without cheating but no matter how many codes I get it doesn’t update the boards. I guess I’ll just use this site 
---
Should add that salty perk from FO4 too.
---
Good thing is they are pretty suffice for normal mobs and super light compare to most rifle. Just not going after the SB or SBQ though. 
---
I used the pipe on them one time and it feels really dragging. 
---
I usually skip the SB if I didn’t bring any powerful gun with me due to weight. 
---
Except you notice those are ingredients for the mod package usually.
---
I want a rad roach king.
---
That would be great
---
I don't even know what direction I want to go with my character build anymore.
---
98% of the weapons in the game are trash if you're a high level solo player.
---
Because they want to limit cap acumulation.
---
They’re selling system isn’t equipped to handle values less than 1 while selling so they’d need to make every junk scrap minimum of 1. 
---
By making us bulk they give a set price.
---
I'm nearing 650 hours played and have never seen a piece of wood gear with more than 1 star. Does 2 or 3 star wood gear even exist? I don't bother picking any of it up anymore. 
---
So you’re saying someone else should make it then name you as a mod?
---
I use an anchor of some sort. A person of friend list, usually.
---
Join their server, put an item into world container (in a rarely traveled location with nobody around). Log off. Switch to the other character, and join the same server. And grab the item back.
---
Things CAN go wrong, if server crashes or someone finds the item before you come back, it's gone. If they server hop while you're switching, the item is gone. And it still sort of requires a 3rd person, just passively, on PC at least. I think on consoles you can join someone from your "Recent" list. 
---
The devs are supposedly aware of this being an issue, and people have been asking a lot about the ability to rejoin server you just left. If this gets added, moving items will get much easier.
---
Doubt it. I play on an Xbox One S and every time I load up it crashes in the first couple minutes.
---
No... not at alll... 
---
#/s
---
Buff weapon durability, it is going to be a huge problem next patch.
---
this is probably the issue but really, who cares?  Would .50 on a hunting rifle be "op" just because the ammo is easier to craft?  
---
Like is ammo crafting cost the thing that makes any one gun "balanced" compared to some other gun?!?  
---
It's a really asinine reason for .50 hunting rifles to be less powerful than .308.  The game would still be fine if ,50 had a small damage boost compared to hardened .308 just so long as it isn't massive.
---
OMG I CAN FINALLY FIX MY STUFF
---
I LOVE YOU
---
I'm incredibly patient, I waited 20 minutes hoping another location would populate on the map....it simply didn't.
---
If your not overburdened then yah you can, with my power armor on I'm at 440 carry weight max, I had 344 on me....When I died the bonus no longer applied and I was set to 340 max and was thus over burdened and could only spawn at the closest location, which was in a blast zone and wouldn't let me because it was in a blast zone.
---
It wasnt a lack of patience it was poor game design linked to a system (dropping junk) that shouldnt be in the game with it in it's current bug ridden state.
---
Wow four replies from Bethesda. Does mean I get a golden holotape?
---
Its really a shit thing to do. Part of the fun of these games has always been being OP and one shotting things at the end of the game. Thats the whole point of grinding perks and ranks and legendaries. If all that grind doesn't pay off in the end, you might as well just play as a low level character in the early areas of the game. 
---
If they are worried about players being OP in relation to other players, they should just rank the servers and match people correctly. I already think that you shouldn't be on a server with a player who can get gear you can't. Make a 0-10 server, 10-25, 25-35, 35-45, and 45+. If people level up through a barrier leave them on the server they are on until they log out. Maybe add exceptions for parties within a certain number of levels of one another. Don't nerf the crap out of endgame (which is just RNG grinding at this point) and take away the only upside it has.
---
So glad they're doing that but I have way more of a problem with not knowing which plans I already learned, stash limit, no nuka cola workshop, other players who dont do what I like, etc
---
Also where is the skyrim holotape already
---
Shit one time someone looked at my melee weapon and they died
---
Get rid of your Targetting HUD.
---
Should fix the issue.
---
Certain pieces of armor and certain mutations grant bonuses to strength mine is currently 18 with a boost from herd mentality and my marine armor chest piece granting extra strength for a total of +54 damage resistance.... I may be wrong but that is my understanding 
---
Every single time I find a new outfit I put I it my stash. Gonna hunt for some of these ones. I found myself a blue bandana and a bone club yesterday. 
---
Playing in dark mode increases critical hit damage. Stacks with sorting by new. 
---
Go explore three forest more.
---
Running thru Morgantown can net you a bunch of xp
---
He's asking for people to help out with his database. 
---
Your comment? Not clever.
---
I have zero ideas. I'm so disappointed in them cause I loved Fallout so much I don't even care anymore. I just don't want them to get away with this disaster and think that this was ok. Especially if they indeed want to introduce p2w lunchboxes. I loved Bethesda before this but this game just felt like a kick to the stomach. Hopefully they learn from it and won't make it even worse. 
---
Also what's the special build I should use. Is everyone stacking strength? I'm frequently running out of carry weight. I'm at 5 strength 
---
Scorched enemies are all off the table now (they were only able to be pacified due to a glitch) Queens can be pacified, not sure on tamed, same goes for Fog Crawlers/Hermit crabs, but fairly sure that 'giant' enemies like Hermits/Fogs/Queens are untamable.  Mega Sloths are close, size wise, but the are just 'large' not so much giant in that they don't have insane defensive stats or count as 'boss' type enemies
---
PC i'm afraid. For xbox i'd get in touch with these guys..

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMfRL77tr3s&amp;index=3&amp;list=LL-DiL1h3dnFDc2n2m0fzNHQ&amp;t=0s
---
This made me laugh way too hard. Thank you.
---
I'm not ticked about the junk so much as at the current system with the buggy nature causing me to lose my carried junk numerous times from stuff like this to deaths followed by disconnects, ect.
---
And this time I wasnt hopping whitesprimgs I was dced while there and upon relogging immediately killed by a nuke then not allowed to respawn anywhere.
---
So basically, from what I’m seeing, I need for strength. Mine caps out at +15, I have a few mutations that are -1 str and a few poor choices in perks. Cheers! Got a few perks to rework, wish I could cure eagle eyea reliably :s
---
yeah no doubt man give him like some badass dapper hat or some shit.  
---

Like that person said, just explore. I would probably max out strength, and always look for the cards that reduce carry weight of things. Specialize in one handed or two handed melee because it saves on ammo. 
---
Nice! There's a couple bandanas that I just started searching for myself
---
You mean the HUD view as opposed to looking at your arm? There is, when you pull up your pip boy, the option "View" at the bottom lets you go from the arm view to the HUD view, works well with chameleon armor/mutation
---
I have not noticed any issues. 
---
I take it you are both playing with the same “Bethesda” account, but just changing the character being used for each of you. I could not come up with anyway to do this reliably and din’t Want to trust a stranger.  My son bought another copy of FO76 and he created 2 characters on that account, a “mule” for each of us so that we can pass hard to find stuff from our higher level character to our new characters.  We have both been playing since the beta and have started over 3 times as we learned the game and figured how to play it.   Nothing like starting out at a low level with a few supplies, and a scoped rifle to get the game going, and having a full set of Raider Armor at lvl 15 also helps a lot.  Hope your kid enjoys it, tell him to look at it like his own movie which he stars in...
---
It was inferred....you are obviously in the same classification of internet trolls that thinks broken systems should be in a game 2 months after release.....that is also inferred if you didnt get it.
---
Being a salty piece of shit on fucking reddit won’t accomplish any of that. You’re literally screaming at strangers. 
---
&gt; First I tried hurling every known curse word as well as a couple I made up just for this situation 
---
I am fan of new curse words, can you share any :D ?
---
My take on it isn't so much "OP" as cost vs benefit. For example, heavy guns cost a lot to run, but you have benefits like high ROF and huge ammo capacity. Which means high ROF will proc staggers and cripples much more, and fewer reloads means consistent long bursts of sustained DPS. Doesn't make them OP, but it has to come at a price. The price is ammo and durability, in this case.
---
The balance is already pretty asinine though. I mean, a Light Machinegun fires the same .308 rounds as the Hunting Rifle. But when you do it from Hunting Rifle, you do 65 base damage. Same bullet from LMG does 16 damage. Why? Because ROF on LMG is 300, and ROF on HR is 3. If LMG did 65 per shot, at 300 RPM, it would make Hunting Rifle completely obsolete.
---
Like I said, it's a weird way of doing it, but apparently that's how Betheda's hive brain works.
---
It is pretty much the same like said myself. Only through the recent discovery of stackinb bobbleheads the reputation of TSE weapons got such a horrible hit, that now everyone wants them nerfed. Especially those who are not really interested in PvP (Like myself) and get gibbed instantly without even accepting a fight.  
---
Or when they see the SBQ instantly drop out of the air once a duper/exploiter/cheater pops hundreds of bobbleheads and oneshots her.   
---
I bet my ass that this nerf would not be up in arms for at least another 2-3 months if this wouldn't have came to be like this. They were in the game since release afterall.  
---
Especially also with dupers making those kind of weapons become so common that everyone can run around with it they of course will be looked at and be frowned upon. I do not blame those people.   
---
The way they try to fix this issue is just overkill. Nerfing the damage of both mods into oblivion fixes absolutely nothing but giving a cold and hard punch into everyones face who farmed honestly for that kind of weapon for weeks or even months.  
---
Just taking out stacking bobbleheads would calm this whole siuation greatly. Even if it at first doesn't look like it, this was the main reason why people really got so pissed at everyone using a TSE.  
---
(Mind you, i do not have one myself. I wish i would still have the luck of finding one at least to have somewhat of a feeling for it before they get nerfed like that, but i won't bet on it.)  
---
The issue is simply that it won't take long till someone finds another way to make a weapon look overpowered. Just look at melee builds for example. They can oneshot players too. Even i got gibbed often enough with those weapons yet i don't scream for nerfs on them.   
---
If this really is such a big problem then splitting up TS and E not being able to be on the same weapon would be the better solution. Like that you can still have a decent weapon, just simply can't have ridiculous damage numbers anymore once you use the perks for it. STILL though the bobblehead stacking HAS to go. THIS ruins really absolutely everything. I do not need a damn TSE weapon to oneshot the queen. If i would have hundreds of explosive bobbleheads i i would just drop in a mininuke or a rocket in her ass and have the same result as with a TSE. Maybe even a way better one.
---
Dude.  I think you just discovered the Higgs Boson!!!!! 
---
Well it's other people to join up with and hunt griefers lol I haven't joined so I'm not sure I'm thinking about it 
---
I once found 200 rounds of .50 in a random chest. I think since their is a machine gun that uses they are treating as if though it's a lot more common. So the .50 upgrade is more of a efficiency upgrade instead of the a damage. Personally I would prefer they lower how much .50 shows (increase craft as well) and increase the damage across the board. Also add .50 pistol.
---
I’m on xb1 if that makes any difference
---
I agree, people should just stand still and wait to be killed. You're entitled to it after all.
---
I'm sorry but sometimes you got to work to catch someone. If a player guys a building by mistake, that means they should lose game functions? 
---
Missle launchers also do less damage per shot than a vanilla handmade. 
---
I tend to be a salty bastard these days. Comes with the territory of debating for 10 years. You don't like it, tough shit mate. Either make a valid argument against me, or go screw a pine-cone for all I care.
---
I actually went all the way through the cave with a automatic laser rifle I found on a corpse in there. Since I hadn't used laser weapons much, I had a butt ton of energy cells. Most fun mission in the game. 
---
Right here my dude (some things are missing though)

Head north, tune into the Grafton station.  Go to Morgantown, there's three events appropriate for your level that trigger there.  Explore the area, that's how you get side/misc missions to trigger.  If something pops up as a daily event complete it.

I've been killed. Not oneshot. More like two or three shots. But it was in a quite short timespan. I don't think that the term "oneshot" really matters. You can get instakilled anyways.
---
Radicool gives you +5 strength at 50% rads. That would be 60 from your Barbarian perk.

Can sombody make me a lever action rifle

Being a rifling shitmunch on a sub won’t protect your precious Elder Scrolls. You are being a dick to people for the sake of being a dick. I pity you deeply and shall allow you to have the last words so your sad life can have a win. 
---
It's really not. Not even from a subjective standpoint either, this game is objectively bad down to its design choices and technical performance. 
---
I can enjoy it but the game jumps at every opportunity to quash any goodwill Its generated. 
---
Remember the shitstorm when we found out BoS were in the game? *The other sub* actually gave out the Twitter link to some poor bastard writer at Bethesda for people to go abuse.
---
They would hatewank themselves into another controversy if Cleo was in too.

.50 cal should automatically scrap all TSE weapons on the target
---
Anything goes in the wasteland.
---
You can use the frame right now, which I know isn't nearly as good... but it is still the best you can do until 25.
---
Also, if you're not aware:
---
You can put the pieces back onto the chassis after you've claimed it.
---
It wont let you pick it back up but it will auto-recall to your inventory with those pieces on it.
---
this will allow you to do what i did: impatiently farm complete power armor sets before you're the right level for them.
---
Then once you hit the right level, you can hop in and do Space Marine RP.
---
It's nice you did the tests. Still, even if it's not a single shot, I got killed with two or three shots. Quite fast, about two seconds. It's a problem.
---
Also, peolpe usually have a little more than a million bobbleheads in the inventory (as seen on screenshots around here). They might stack 100, perhaps 1000? I don't know.
---
I've ran into the Flatwoods Monster maybe 3 times in the same area by Berkeley Springs.

Nerfed or not nerfed. I’ll still be using my...

TS Lever Action
---
TS Gauss Rifle
---
TS Tesla Rifle
---
TS Assaultron Head
---
TSE Dragon
---
All of which I grinder and farmed my arse off for. 
---
These are my guns that I’m proud to have!
---
Here’s a hint on how I was successful. Look at the corpse for longer than a second. Wait for that legendary weapon, sometimes takes a little time to drop!!!
---
300+ hours of play at this stage doesn’t hurt either...
---
Over 300 hours here. Still enjoying it but I do wish I could do more with all the scrap I have, along with some more interesting events.
---
This is making me REALLY glad I didn't spec into WW.
---
Yes, a 3 budget system does seem more ideal, but how will I be able to keep my 5 industrial water pumps?
---
So how does this work? Let’s say I get the cards and max them out. I equip them. Get the sloth to live with me and he stays home even after i unequip the cards?
---
Go check out that fissure prime on the bottom right of the map
---
The MG42 is already garbage. The damage is too low for what ammo it uses

Where exactly is that. I dont think I found that yet. 
---
If you dip it in cola it increases AP refresh too!
---
You asked why people come onto a sub about 76 when they hate 76. IU gave you an answer and all you can do is snivel that people are being a dick because we come onto a sub about 76 with criticisms about the game. Grow the fuck up mate.
---
Tried it, one-shot some poor guy a bunch of times.
---
Tried it again, got one-shot by someone.
---
Wasn't fun.
---
Bethesda needs to start adding content soon or they will start to loose players. Maybe even give us a there plans for the next year not like going in to details that could spoil things or make false promises but just a general way forward. Maybe even when we can expect content released. Overall just better communication. I would love for them to do an AMA.
---
Especially if you have he Sin Kissed perk and can make it to 6:00 AM. Literally changed how I play. 
---
It would create a massive gap in viability between legendary and non legendary weapons, with the potential to cause a lot of havoc with balancing. Either things will be too easy with a legendary, or too difficult without one.
---
overdrive nerf sucked. I guess they only want crits in vats.
---
So many people don't butter the toast to the edge. I mean come on!!

This needs to be a Rank 2 perk of that card...

Someone on pc nuked Poseidon last night about 1030pm est. Was a shock to load into the train station and almost die of rads. I didn't go in the plant, but all the scortched were 68+
---
It was a joke about income inequality...
---
Clearly you were the wrong audience.
---
It's horrific atm. Game is still alpha, no shared stash or mail.
---
It would be cool to base it somewhat in real life but on the opposite side I don't want necessarily to be a mil sim. Otherwise the absolute best load out would be power armor with a minigun with DU rounds.
---
No, I'm talking about the background behind all the dials taking up 25% of the screen. When in third person, the background is not visable.

Frankly from that trash post I linked you sound pretty dam salty you are losing your TSE crutch there chief.

Hunt around the northwest side of the forest. Raider armor spawns at level 15 
---
I know how you feel man. I started with Morrowind on PC, then played Oblivion at 360 launch. I wasn't at all familiar with Fallout until after FO3, but I loved BGS and fell in love with FO3. NV was a masterpiece and FO4 was not. Since the days of FO3 I had been waiting to play a multiplayer FO game with my friends, and what I got was a disappointment. I have fun playing 76, when it's not constantly crashing or buggin out. If they release p2w I'm done with Bethesda. I've already decided against ever preordering another one of their games. If they keep this up they'll lose a big fan forever because of their greed. I'm not particularly excited for ES6 because of all the crap in this game that has still yet to be fixed.
---
kind of ot but the real problem with automatics is less the base damage and more how dr works.
---
the higher the base damage the less enemy dr matters.  so basically a weapon that deals say 100 damage per shot might do 8-10x more damage than a gun that only does 25 damage because of DR scaling.
---
the end result of all this is automatic weapons get screwed more by dr than other weapon classes.
---
imo all automatics should have some sort of innate armor piercing to offset that at least somewhat.
---
I'll just throw my past experience out there.  I played through the Division story/quests whatever until i finished that.  I wandered in to the central area to check it out.  They had a similar system.  I had to attack someone for them to be able to attack me.  I was killing some mobs and someone ran out in front of me in my line of fire.  They killed me..
---
No thanks i'll keep pacifist on.  I'm like 206 as of this week with over 300 hours now.  I've pvp'd and it's just 1-shot TSE shotguns.  It's like rock paper scissors.. not fun.
---
Can't argue with that! Here's to hoping that patch accomplishes something although I have my worries that it'll go from 1-shot to 1.5-shot pvp. I think there may need to be some fundamental damage balance changes done if this patch doesn't work.
---
You smell correctly
---
Why do people bother buying prime weapons when they don’t have the plans to do so themselves... now they can’t even make the ammo to use the gun xD 
---
My solution is complicated but it works to solve the dup'ing and market issue Bethesda has and keep things semi-intact. Remove Explosive as a Legendary Effect and have it be turned into a Legendary Mod ( same as the Scorch Killer Receiver ) and make it a reward from future content + have any weapon with Legendaries Mods, be un-tradable. You can keep damage as it is. The issue with TSE is not their damage, it's their abundance because of dup'ing. 
---
I dump my stuff at either Charleston or Watoga. I don't know exactly how many minu-nukes you can fit into a lunch pail, but it's a lot...

Let's hope they get their shit together. For Starfield's and ES6's sake.

---
Its singe shot and auto
---
Agreed, killed her like 60 times and have never taken out a TSE. 
---
Don’t need a fancy gun to get those explosive vent plans.
---
I agree with you in principle but I also understand why Betheda did it. Due to the .50 machine gun using the same round (and chewing through a massive amount of ammo), they increase the spawn rate and craft rate of .50. So .308 is relatively rare compared to .50. Personally I feel like they should have balanced the otherway around. Making the .50 ammo rare and increasing the overall damange the machine gun does. Maybe balance it by decreasing it's accuracy a bunch or increasing repair costs (or like a billion other ways they could balance it).
---
I won't kill them, frogs, foxes, beavers, or squirrels unless I need to. Those possums gotta die though
---
Have any of you experiencing this glitch ever adjusted FOV setting? Just curious to find a solution. After I changed FOV to 90 (like most games use) I started experiencing the V.A.T.S. glitch. It drives me mad!!!!
---
That is the marketing strategy right?
---
Did you not follow the Flatwoods Responders' quest line?  Also, every place that has a map on its wall - place your cursor on each pin and it will update it on your map. You can't fast travel to them, but at least you know where they are. Also find lookout towers, go to the top, and "activate area" - that adds spots too. Then go! Explore! Watch out for mutant irradiated ticks!
---
Pvp has no purpose the most I get is a few caps and some junk.  All of which I can get without pvp.  Why waste the resources.  It doesn’t make the game more fun.  In each of my pvp experiences I felt like it was a hassle and whether I win or lose it has very little consequence.
---
Dat bacon...
---
Where exactly is this forest
---
their original notes said they are removing the extra projectile entirely and changing it to a flat +25% bonus damage.  that reference was removed when they updated the article but his is where I'm getting my theory from ;)
---
I agree with that point! Until TSE is nerfed or damage is more balanced I doubt many people are going to consistently enjoy pvp. 
---
I just pick mine as I go, depending one which of the available cards I want to use. Or, if I'm running out of AP very quickly when using VATS as I am currently. It's not the efficient way to do it, but I'm just doing some exploring. One of the early quests I'd neglected just recently got me a few stimpaks. What's it called? Not quite sure. Morgantown and it's airport is probably a good place for now, east of the vault or so.
---

Make sure you dont scrap it!!! Or was that fixed? Lol

Um, whats wrong with seeking revenge, not all pvp engagements are one person dies and its completely over, seeking revenge keeps you guys in pvp, any time someone is seeking revenge, a decent player on the ranged will win against a melee in most engagements after, the only way the melee will win after his initial kill is if he has a lot of cover to use that allows them to get close again
---
I came across a guy named Kilroy today at whitesprings and he was offering to help everyone there. He was super nice and it was such a cool thing to do. I was looking for the black cowboy hat and someone else overheard and told me where to find it. I just love this community!!!
---
If it wasnt for the TSE I bought on the trading sub, I'd still be using a non legendary lever action and All Rise. I've found nothing else really to use in 200 hours. I'm more of an armor finder apparently.
---
And I mean, they're horrifying abominations that don't deserve to live.
---
And the ones in '76 are even worse.
---
I bought several of them at levels 15-20, learned one only to realize no sniper build, but I figure I can make another loadout as I level.
---
I'm a huge fan of the Tesla and Lever action for sniping.
---
Oh I get it. People invested everything into TSE and need rank 3 in salty perk now.
---
Oh, and revolutionary sword. 
---
Hell yes, all the hoarding has to stop! This is partly why I put my game away, Marie Kondo helped me realise it was no longer bringing me joy. Lol, I'm firing it back up today after a good break.
---
The "nerfs" are affecting all guns equally so there's no need for you to misdirect attention at the very much needed fixes for those legendary affixes.
---
The game mechanics are skewed heavily against rapid fire and low damage attacks, which pretty much defines the Fallout minigun. The discussions that should be raised should revolve around the damage resistance formula as it affects low damage attacks.
---
BUT I don't charge 60 dollars and it actually works.
---
Jokes aside: While I do understand your issue, I have to disagree. Yes, there is not a lot of content yet. But what exactly do you expect? More farmspots, deposits? I can't run down the entire map and find every single spot. I still have a real life. If everyone who reads this tells me one unique spot to farm, the website will have fucktons of content in mere days.
---
It's not supposed to be the ultimate fo76 resource for everything. It's supposed to be a small wiki for those who don't want to search hours for a good spot to farm adhesive. 
---
What if it's a giant fev experiment gone wrong that ran away from westek?
---
Just you wait on the shitstorm coming once the nerf hits and everyone who didn't read the patchnotes realized they can throw away their weapons now they (hopefully) farmed for or bought it from a normal player for weeks. (I don't mind dupers getting shit on though)
---
No seriously. This is one of the bigger issues yet again. People who dislike something feel the urge to punish their fellow players for something others fuck up. (It was the bobblehead stacking issue that really made the TSE weapons so overpowered against other players even and at the end made them go up in arms against TSE, thinking those only are the issue.)  
---
I don't have a TSE myself. I still would love to try one before the nerf hits but i know i am out of luck.   
---
The biggest issue however is the SBQ fight. Once the whole server with all low level players join in the event you can pretty much forget about killing her again, since no one can compensate the damage needed against her after she scales into 20 players content even if olny like 3-4 player are even meant to be fighting her from a level and gear aspect.  
---
(Note on that. Low level players. I do not mind you joining in the fight if we still have the TSE weapons, since we can carry you through it with those weapons. But once that nerf hits.. please stay away. You will only stir up more shit on the forums against you and those who are at fault that this nerf came to be.)
---
Pretty sure that's what's coming after the next patch. Check the inside the vault article.
---
They are literally working on a seperate server system with no pvp rules atm. You don't have to pvp if you don't want to. 
---
There is no endgame.
---
One encounter with a sub-par boss that can be soloed with the right perks/weapons combos, not much thought/effort was put into it.
---
I pretty much play for the environment right now.
---
You literally start in the forest. If you look at your map it's the big green area in the West central area
---
In my head I imagine BGS had a GTA 5 style system in mind. Definitely not there though. I personally don't mind the low stakes of PvP because it makes it more accessible and even "griefing" doesn't really set someone back more than half an hour worth of junk grinding. I just personally like Pvp in the same way I enjoy playing halo multiplayer but also enjoy the campaign.
---
Imagine the fun on both? One yyou always have to watch your back, no pacifist mode, 
---
And on the other side, everyone helping each other?
---
Maybe try to have range of levels per server so no level 100 killing level 20.
---
I’m looking forward to playing The Outer Worlds and seeing what Obsidian has to offer with that brand new IP. 
---
Yup, that’s the one.  I recently finished that responder mission where you go through a blazing mining tunnel, thought it was kinda cool looking.
---
Agreed bobblehead and chem stacking need to be capped
---
Bethesda is the only company I know makes left handed reload animation especially the left handed hunting rifle reload, cringy af!!!! 
---
And they make .50cal deal less damage than .308, why even bother call them .50cal and .308 if you are not gonna follow the real world application? The most important thing when you attemp to make a gun derived from real world is to make it feel and play like in the real world, you can tweak the components requirement sure but the gun has to be feel real.
---
Playing with chronic Dysentery would be pretty Punishing...
---
Ive never crashed. Literally. 
---
Well gee how am I supposed to know it's a forest, all the trees or something? 
---
(Yes I'm stupid)
---
And i did so with this game for sure.
---
Also it really depends on the weapon, I’ve found that explosive weapons do far less damage then their non explosive counterparts against her honestly. I stick to plain old two shots when I fight her and see grey chunks come out of her. If I use my TSE pipe sniper it doesn’t really do much at all even though it hits for nearly 1400 damage a shot. I even see this on normal scorchbeasts, but it’s much weirder with there, sometimes I see their entire hp bar turn grey but then only a small chin I comes out lol
---
All the need to do to make PvP viable would be make it so player to player damage is 10-20% of normal damage. They already have a system in place for when shooting someone to start PvP that could be used for this purpose. It would take little to nothing to implement. Might even be as simple as changing a value.
---
alright, I am about to check. thanks
---
Then it must be true /s
---
I had loved the idea that, after you finish a questline, you get a personal Mr. Handy you can use as your vendor. You can send him anywhere on the map and he sells your stuff, and maybe you can tell him to buy stuff too, like up to 5 stimpaks for 25caps/piece. That'd be awesome.
---
There is no PVP right now in it's current form, it's tit for tat and griefing.
---
Good post though! 
---
Oof. 
---
I can get behind this suggestion.  
---
Kind sir or madame, have an upvote
---
That's because Fallout 4 wasn't mainly supported by its developers, instead it was supported by its community through mods. This is the first game that is currently being supported in full by developers, which directly allows them to learn from their mistakes. It took us this long for them to finally implement an FOV slider in-game without the need of a mod or adjusting config files! 
---
This game is basically a giant mod for Fallout 4 and the reason why people complain is because it was made by the developers themselves instead of the community and feel like their resources could've gone to Fallout 5, which if you've been following Bethesda, they don't release a direct sequel without heavily modifying the current engine first, which takes a very long time. So it makes sense that there are issues from Fallout 4 that made their way to this game because not only did the community fixed the majority of the game, but they're using the same engine for Fallout 4, however, it's heavily modified for multiplayer. We also need to take into account that we have no clue when the game began development and how long it actually took. We don't know the process and we don't know how many people were in each team to helped develop this while they're also working on other projects. We don't know what we don't know, yet we jump to a conclusion.
---
I solo capture Poseidon with my lvl 9 alt... now, powering the plant to get the fusion plan to power the FC resource, that a different matter ;)
---
I’ll try that later tonight if it’s doable.
---
Hope u find it
---
Yeah.....the whole draw of a slot machine is the possibility of winning an awesome prize. I find myself extremely lethargic today about this game. What exactly is the point of playing a loot based game if all of the loot sucks?
---
Blue print early, blue print often. 
---
P.s.  I don't PvP or grief but have had my camped wrecked too.  This just feeds the trolls. 
---
Wait, was it alive?!
---
False. I've gotten plenty of 3*'s from boys I dropped with the super sledge in one hit. 
---
I think the game would be more interesting if power armor couldn't be used until level 50+.
---
Survival would be a lot more serious that way.
---
Suuure, next thing you're gonna tell is that you could "Make Friends" with it.
---
Don't think u can play instrument in power armor 
---
It also saves 8 loadouts. I can't stress enough how amazing it is.
---
I feel like pvp should be locked to non legendary weapons and on it own server or mode. 
---
The issue I am having is that if it isn’t done right it can be abused which I think is why it is the way it is now. I mean, are you suggesting to turn all co-op events into a kum bai ya happy time where wanteds and unmarked players can’t hurt anyone at all? That seems ok, until you realize wanteds could just run to events to hide out and avoid bounty hunters. I mean, I do get what you’re saying, but there doesn’t seem to be a way to do it differently without it being taken advantage of in unintended ways. At least right now a wanted player can just avoid those zones.
---
Maybe if the game pops up a warning about this when entering events while wanted, so at least players don’t get ambushed by this?
---
Yup, yup, yup!
---
I would actually go with accuracy and recoil on automatics, instead of damage nerf. And this would apply to VATS as well. Unfortunately they made it so that crits can never miss, which forced them into this approach. Similarly, they could make stagger and cripple considerably higher on automatics, and considerably lower (nonexistent?) on single shots. And pistols could be really, really cheap on AP in VATS, so you can VATS with them forever. Maybe bring back Relentless legendary prefix, but only for pistols.
---
My group is 0 for a couple on it and 2 of us has tse.
---
Oh yeah. Forgot about that. Cannot see it doing more damage than a lever or combat rifle though. 
---
I'm taking a wait and see approach.
---
it seems the general nerf to critical hits, which is what made pistols viable in fo4, is the problem.
---
On you mean like steam did oh wait steams was way worse of a like dumbass 
---
I have a 90% reduced weight minimum weighing 25.4 lbs my friends minigun weighs 30 lbs.   Only recently noticed because I carry all my big guns and use bear arms lv 3. 
---
Sad that I can’t hold all the big guns I want in my stash because of they’re ridiculous weight.
---
Hope this is fixed soon that gun should weigh 0.25 with the perks
---
It's an actual plan not a mod so no danger of that. 
---
FWIW, I've found that I will never need more than 50 of these for anything:
---
Cloth
---
Leather
---
Acid
---
Bone
---
Copper
---
Crystal
---
Concrete
---
Fiber Optics
---
Fiber Glass
---
Gold
---
Asbestos 
---
Fertilizer
---
Antiseptic
---
They said in the latest blog "This mode will be designed for fans that want a more hardcore PvP experience."
---
Right now everyone is down voting anything related to the TS and E nerfs. Change your sorting order in the sun to controversial and you will see tons of other threads down voted.
---
Depends since it has a 85 round mag the dps is very high 
---
I've seen it dead many times. If you found it alive you would be the first I heard of. 
---
That's absolutely true, for most intents and purposes melee is massive overkill, except for a handful of enemies. But again, that's if you build for absolutely highest damage imaginable. I really like the super-tanky build (still low health, but running Suppressor and Dodgy). Most enemies still die in 1-shot, some may need a power attack, but my health doesn't even move any more.
---
I'm actually not sure if it caps at 20 or not. I really feel like it doesn't, at least on the character sheet it does say +35 Strength. And carry capacity I'm reasonably sure does go up. I can't be totally certain, because the UI is still buggy. For example that armor that increases DR with your health being lower, it doesn't actually display it on the item, you have to look at it as the stats overall. So could be the same here. If you look at this vid, at 4m 22 sec the guy shows his damage, he's pretty heavily buffed, but he does 3.5k per swing, and that thing swings fast. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDiHxJL-e7I#t=4m21s  It's also not the highest I've seen.
---
No unfortunately, I stumbled across it dead. I do have a couple of images that I took of it. But I don't know how to post them in the subreddit.
---
I'd like a return to the different ammo types, but I have a feeling it won't happen.
---
To be fair there was clearly no intent for critical hits outside VATS. If there were we would have a chance defined by out Luck stat.
---
If not, I’ll just do it on top of the armor.  Doing it with a nuke blowing up in the background would be sweet too.
---
Sounds good, or maybe even just have a shanty town with robot vendors that players can rent spring up in the immediate area around the outside of the vault.
---
You have to go into the ini file for now. Here's a good link for that and a few other settings.
---
[https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-pc-depth-of-field-fov-anti-aliasing/](https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-pc-depth-of-field-fov-anti-aliasing/)
---
I believe it’s not that you are putting anything in the stash, it’s that you are “activating it”. From what other people said sometimes the game thinks the stash materials aren’t available until you actually open your stash. 
---
Hey I disagree w the TSE nerf. I think they should have started w boblehead stacking and went from there. 
---
I would honestly just be happy with a plot bare enough I could see my friggin' carrots without having to run around looking at the ground and spamming the action button.
---
There are a bunch of different Mr Fuzzy's in the waterpark - search the lockers. My last trek there I got 4, including a Candy Fan Mr Fuzzy.
---
I already do that in real life.
---
TSE needs nerfing no matter what issues there is with the LMH/Minigun. Oneshotting everything isn't fun, especially not when someone else does it all the time and you cant loot, because the game needs you to do dmg to a mob, in order to recieve loot.
---
Winner.
---
Blaming a legendary affix having its damage reduced for the minigun sucking is insane.
---
Actually I think that would be the perfect fix. You have good points. So many unwritten rules about player to player interactions. Beths lack of spelling out the mechanics have led to many, frustrated, dead players. Most of them not in the wanted situation though.
---
I was like what is that purple glowing thing over there and I was like could it be...The crazy thing is now I am level 68 and since I have level 50, I don't run into the same creatures. I was always seeing Anglers, Snallygasters, Rad Scorpions, and Honeybeasts now I rarely see them.
---
PVP balance = dead FO76
---
Short but frequent FPS drops are my life since the last patch, unfortunately.  Have tried a lot to troubleshoot, but it's borderline unplayable for me now.  
---
AA is enabled by default but lots of us change the type to FXAA through the config file.
---
sAntiAliasing=FXAA
---
Or just search for FO76 ini file settings.
---
That's not how math works
---
No i doubt they will nerf the queen, im sure they want right now what they originally intended, 8+ player for the queen fight
---
My bad, I should read slower lolol
---
But for the mod scrapping... was it fixed? Lol
---
I see what you're saying but you have to consider not everyone wants to PvP. Some people want to raid, some people just PVE casually, some like to just collect stuff. Others just want to build. For as long as I can remember in nearly 20 years of obline gaming, most of these camps if players get mad at others and demand changes. 
---
Usually the retort to any player that doesn't fit in these camps is something along the lines of, "Then this isn't the game for you." But 76 tries to cater to multiple play styles. This is not exclusive to the game. Calling out players for the style of playing isn't new either.
---
Not disagreeing with anything you said. Points are valid. Just noting there's more than one perspective. 
---
Because they can buy that too
---
It exists. It's always dead when you find it tho
---
Fair point with egg head. I guess I saw "egg" and didn't think more on that other than birds and eggs are related.
---
That being said, mutations giving a player a visual change would be awesome but I feel like it might be tricky to do right. 
---
I can also see there being a faction of herbivores that actively try to "save the animals" by hunting down people with the carnivore mutation and murdering them.
---
Not for much longer... Muhahaha! 
---
Excellent point!  If I can add to your great post, why do the Mods even weight 1lb?  It uses screws, adhesives, fiber to make it which have their own weight, the Mods should just be paper plans to build from, so there's that too :)
---
Just go to the CAMP and repair it
---
No big deal
---
This is why PVP balance will kill FO76.  
---
PVP is the problem.  Not Two shot or Explosive or Bloodied or anything.
---
I guess so, just seems like a pain in the ass lol, might as well buy the plan at that point, buy the cheaper one and throw your own on xD 
---
Like my Pappy use to say: "Try it and found out."
---
Ah okay, so it's a regular spawn. I wonder if it's a bug or maybe hinting towards intelligent deathclaws in Appalachia. (Almost certainly the former but it would amazing if they did this.)
---
Found three across the river from gorge junkyard 
---
They desperately want people to PVP. So much that they’re building a separate mode for it. But that mode is not going to work with the current TSE damage because if you don’t have one, you’d be screwed.
---
Have a friend take you to Camden park to get the west bridge gate key. Level 15 power armor will spawn at the bridge along with an extra fusion core. The hardest part is getting the key because the mobs at Camden are about level 20 to 32. The keys is on the rollercoaster in a backpack of one of the carts.
---
Oh yeah, I know. I read almost everything on this fudging app. Everyone's gotta caaaaalm down. And Bethesda needs to stop doing everything backwards. 
---
Great veg starch farm blueprint guide video. I make veg starch and bulk to sell at vendors EVERY DAY. Adhesive is the top needed ingedient and a personal farm is vital to a players camp.
---
You can get it from all daily quests and events in *The Divide* region.
---
It's incredibly unlikely though, so be prepared for the long haul or to buy it from someone luckier.
---
Second this
---
Thats interesting, especially the non legendary weapon part. Probably my favorite game to duel in was Diablo 2. All items legendary effects still worked but what they did was apply a flat 5/6th damage debuff for any player to player damage. Not sure if that'd be feasible in this game.
---
You might want to check your math on that
---
It's an elegant solution, however they're not going to do that.
---
How rude!
---
Did she at least ask if you were gonna eat that?
---
Hahaha! 
---
Super mutants most use them 
---
You are the only person who seems to get it.   They are killing their game for the 2% of their shittiest playerbase who will move onto the next pubg in a month...  
---
I swear its like they want to kill their own game.  Like some dev in the group hates that its online and just keeps selling the company bad ideas on purpose.
---
Yup, couple that with respective weapon perks and explosive perks and they will still be good guns 
---
Try tongue but hole.
---
Is your Bathesda tag the same as on here? The Discord group I'm in hardly gets on anymore and I'm looking for people to run the silo quest with, if I can't solo it. 
---
You probably don't need it. 
---
Gamers are hoarders. The worst kind of hoarders. 
---
I honestly thought this was how it worked at first too. Would be nice to have a bit more transparency with some of these "behind the scenes" kinds of mechanics
---
yes, it is across the access road from the workshop on the side of a building. Thanks for the help. I probably walked by it 10 times
---
It's just childish mental gymnastics. Some kid dropped a cookie in the sand and now they feel entitled to someone else's. Zzz.
---
Its the city up north with the airport.
---
Lots of stuff to do there
---
Nerfing damage output and XP gains slows player progress through existing content to take pressure off Bethesda to add additional content. They didn't expect anyone to be able to launch nukes in the beta. Low replay value and minimal content is a huge problem right now, so the quick fix is to make it harder to reach the endgame by nerfing. 
---
Without Demolition Expert adding TSE to a gun already multiplies its damage by 4-6x, or a shotgun by ~8x. That is already too much.
---
No other legendary affix combination comes even close.
---
The nerfs are necessray.
---
Subbed, well done on the video! 
---
Maybe /r/accidentalporn
---
no I see what you're saying as well but, in my mind at least, any player looking for a solely PvE experience already has one. They only things that are gated behind potential pvp are workshops. You could run around Appalachia with pacifist mode on until you're level 10000 and never once have to fight a player you didnt want to. The only caveat I'll add however is that I don't think people should be able to wreck others bases unless theyre hostile back.
---
Under intelligence, you only have 2 special points allocated. Your gunsmith perk card looks like lvl 4. You will need at least 4 points in intelligence to equip that card. 
---
If you have all your points maxed, you'll need to move 2 points from other specials into intelligence.
---
Yes, and still fps drops after fast travel due to massive overdraw.
---
Works on Xbox too.
---
Doing this made my game open on the tray but I can't tab into it, essentially its permanently minimized and i cant do shit now
---
Well bathesda does not cater to the pc kids 
---
Saved levels up halts the ability to unlock new perks.
---
You have to spend some to be able to raise gunsmith to 5
---
The number on the top left of the card is the "cost" of equipping it - the sum of the perk cards you want to equip in a SPECIAL stat can't exceed your points in that stat.
---
So for example, to equip Gunsmith 4 you'd need 4 Intelligence (you only have 2), and you'd have to unequip Contractor to free up 2 of those points. To equip Starched Genes you'd have to unequip one of your other Luck perk cards to free up at least 2 points.
---
I love it when my crops get duped; soup for days!
---
Lmao
---
&gt; Debuff the queen or have her be landed most of the event since no high dps ranged weapons will exist anymore.  
---
A team with TSE weapons can currently kill the SBQ in about 15 seconds. That is if anything the clearest example that these nerfs are necessary.
---
Cry me a river if it takes five minutes after the update.
---
I'm the son of WVs and 2 best meth cooks. At age 3 I had mastered the family business and moved on to creating weapons, different chems, ect. 
---
When my parents house was raided by the cops I was found modifying a fusion core I found. The local Vault-Tec reps heard about me after after testing my IQ decided to grant me entrance to the vault.
---
Now I live my life attempting to learn how to craft everything possible in the wasteland, picking up friends and being a bad ass along the way.
---
Also people keep thinking it's creating more space in their stash's but that just because they're throwing their plastic away on heavier junk.
---
So the issue is that TSE does do way to much damage rn, but i think the issue is explosive far more than it is two shot. Explosive should have never been 100% which was ridiculous, it should have been a choice to throw in a little splash damage instead of choosing more direct damage like with +50% crit damage or 10% while aiming. That being said i think if explosive is staying at 25% damage while aiming and other damaged based secondary modifiers need to be buffed because that still makes it the superior choice. Two shot on the other hand i think should have been left alone and been the reliable option for prefix modifiers, while mutants and suppressors get a buff to be close to its level while berserkers and bloodied are an option to be a glass cannon but do more damage than two shot or mutants.
---
And no melee is to strong rn, especially considering it has no ammo expenditure and speed demon makes it very easily to close in at the damage it does rn. 
---
Btw cool you shit man, i dont know who hurt you lol but raging on the internet for no reason is not the sign of a healthy temper or state of mind. 
---
Dis r highly “rewarding” locations 
---
Level 2 character can sell them for 200.
---
Don't tell anyone, though. I feel like this is unintentional.
---
Wait for the:
---
"Melee can do 5k damage it's not fair."
---
"Melee can 1 shot people in PVP"
---
"why do guns only do 200 damage against SBQ and melee can do thousands"
---
While people ignore melee needs to get in range and to have such high damage you need to invest in radicool and have high rads, nerd rage so low health, bloodied again low health, adrenaline rush which you need to ramp up etc etc. Also ignoring you can 1 shot people in pvp w a rifle build as well. 
---
You pretty much said the same already I'm just expanding. 
---
Nah, PvP is fine.
---
...because after TSE, melee is the biggest offender when it comes to doing obscene damage. It's perfectly logical progression of events, and has nothing to do with retaliation or spite. After melee is nerfed, we'll zero in on the next biggest offender, my guess would be low-HP builds, which can generate significantly more damage while arguably being tankier than normal builds. And round and round it'll go.
---
He's a fuckin cannibal clown
---
I know exactly where that corpse is...first time I saw it I started dying laughing and called over my friends thinking it was a glitch only on my screen. Turns out it wasn't and we gang banged him to Country Roads lol 
---
"Server not responding"
---
"Disconnected from server"
---
On PC, solid connection, even tried with a VPN and it is still a chronic problem.
---
At level 14 you've probably already beaten the storyline quests and launched a nuke or 2. So... I guess ... stop playing until new content is released, like everyone else?
---
Yup, they take up a large amount of budget (2 turrets worth) but also seem to be better at defending than turrets are, as for turrets to work properly you also need spot lights
---
Fake quit lieing to people
---
Yeah thanks, my lips are sealed
---
Too bad most ppl give two shits about pvp
---
r/brandnewsentence
---
At this point you use melee or you’re just handicapping yourself. It’s annoying really but that’s what you’re being pushed into if you don’t want to waste hundreds of rounds on a trash mob.
---
In another game it is, no place for it in a pve game.
---
I agree. I guess I'm just hoping for a balance between the play styles. I'm one of those types that change mine depending on my mood. Lol. I'm sure we all have days where we want the resources from a workshop but don't want to deal with other people. 
---
BS theres only like 3 different servers when im hopping.
---
Kind of. I'd say the people around here just want to take everyone else's cookie away. And not even that good of a cookie if you compare the 2. 
---
Overdrive itself is pretty rare high levels even and to make it requires goo from the bog. So it is not like they slowed progress, just more made it so people would have to go in large groups to the queen instead of soloing or duoing her in  few minutes. Hence my rant on why they need to level lock the event at the least. If I have to carry 6 extra level 20s I better be able to crit using overdrive. That was a disturbing day Me one level 67 with a minigun and 6 level 20s. Took 20 minutes to down her and way way way to much ammo. Thankfully I had gotten the bug that let my broken gun still be used. 
---
It's a testament to how Bethesda treats it's player base. :)
---
“The Crosshair” would be a good place for Raider (level 15) pieces
---
/r/fo76/comments/aevcek/_/edt120x/
---
This isn't a PvE game, though.
---
It's both PvP and PvE.
---
Can't you sell them to players for like 500? There seem to always be people looking to buy serums.
---
That's the thing, the entire system can exist exactly as it functions now, and appease both sides with the simple addition of opt-in playlist game modes, especially one that matched people across servers.
---
When you have 2 to 6 out of the couple dozen players who want to engage others and can't, griefing just becomes worse and more creative. A way for all PvP oriented players to match up and face off against each other in full structured scored modes would only help funnel off excess player vs player aggression, especially if it actually contributed to game progression and offered another way to play the game because if the TS/Bobblehead glitch is any indication, it's that griefers will ALWAYS find a way.
---
Best place would be either Westec in Savage divide or if you just want easy guns go-to WV Lumber Co. In the North West of the Forest max lvl I've seen was a lvl 10 mutant
---
Quantum Entanglement.
---
It's the only answer that fits.
---
Here's hoping they can manage to not fuck this up and make the problem worse.
---
It should add 25% damage divided among 8 pellets, making it scale the same as other guns.
---
Optimally the explosive suffix damage will be divided over the pellets as well.
---
I’m extremely aroused. 
---
Fudgemuppet? Smergh? Poofestophocles? Tapioca? Kankleclown? 
---
Aka empty servers and splitting a small community up more. Bad move Beth
---
He's talking about Rose's mission, it's a reference to another deadclaw, i don't see it as yours does not exist.
---
K. You're dumb. 
---
What the hell are you even talking about?
---
Slapper damage isnt even a part of this conversation.
---
Damn. I've found this too, and heard stories, but as far as I've known it's only ever been found dead.  
---
World events maybe (look at warframe and that event that destroyed some relays). Like a collective event over a month. You can donate steel, reprogram robots to work on the rails, clear monsters on the tracks, etc. All of that across all servers fills a progressive bar. When the bar fills up the railroads are fixed. Then maybe a certain amount of maintenance goes into it (like every month the community needs to fill a smaller bar to keep it working).
---
Don’t hate the player hate the game 🤣🤣🤣
---
Think so? Hmmm... 
---
Ima spread more chaos until nerfs go out then uninstall.
---
I am selling legendary weapon,armor,rare clothes and ammo.
---
WTF do you think the high damage melee build is?
---
The bloodied low damage build where melee is getting shot the fuck up all the time and dying. 
---
Thanks problem is no one is willing to learn other playstyles and get beat and then go cry to nerf something instead of learning how to counter. 
---
Isn’t that the the main complaint about wanting a separate server so that PvP players don’t grief PvE players 
---
I bet the math on melee might be looked at eventually.
---
But 2x 100% is obscene for guns.
---
Do you happen to use Windows 10 background slideshow?
---
Yeah I agree. I can apreciate it more now by not approaching it as working towards the big boss or whatever like most other games. It just seems a little pointless but I like all the stories and scenery.
---
Sanka you dead mon? 
---
Yeah that melee build you described is taking a pretty big risk waiting for SBQ to land. Unless they’re using marsupial etc but you get the gist. Regardless it’s a pretty specific build for that damage, not just grab a gun and bang bang bang dead.
---
Can you pass on an idea please. The community is in an outrage for the coming nerfs but the best idea is simply make it where demo expert perk card wont apply to guns. It should only apply to explosives such as grenades, mines, launchers, and fatman. 
---
This provides much a much needed "balanced" nerf to the op effect. 2 shot 50 cal only does 87 damage with my perk setup and if that goes lower it is a non viable weapon as well as most rabged weapons. 
---
I don't do a lot of trading, but I'm not averse to it either. Over the last 10 trade encounters I've had, no one even requested my empath serum.that's the only one I have a recipe for at this point.
---
Yeah, that's what makes them think that their false data is correct. They see the raw numbers incorrectly, they forget they essentially threw away pounds of plastic, and they see that they have less weight now than before.
---
He could have a shitty serum that no one buys. I sell at least 50 serums a day and not once has a person asked for chameleon or empath 
---
Veal, baby sloth, very tender  /shrug
---
Glad i could help
---
That’s such a great story and exactly why they went this way for the game.
---
No amount of coding can e eat give the the experience another person can.
---
I live for these moments, and the game provides them for me and my friends so frequently. That’s why I think the game is a success on its basic design principle. 
---
People crest the best experience for each other. 
---
The buff the queen gets from additional players can be crazy. Especially if they throw down a camp
---
Why is this a slippery slope? Whybwoiod someone go to all the lengths justify that literally everything has to be nerfed if they reduce the damage of something that they reduced the damage of in 4?
---
TL;DR Looney speak right here
---
There is practically no skill in PVP here. It's a gear top trumps game. If you've got regularly personally-looted gear and your opponent is decked out in assassin/sent with min/maxed perks for their TSE (or whatever the meta will be next week) then why bother?  
---
Maybe people think that if they've opted out of PVP with the pacifist toggle. Or that opening a random container wouldn't suddenly override that decision. I had a 10c bounty tonight and I've STILL got absolutely no clue how I got it. Best guess is that a stray bullet maybe hit a camp in he distance that I never noticed? Anyhow, I relogged to find some events, and I came back to the death animation finishing just as I finished loading in. A team of three PVPers came to collect that 10c bounty and my junk. Luckily they felt sorry for me and gave it back after checking my gear, probably in part because I didn't get all salty with them. Schit happens, move on  glad I got my jnuk back, wouldn't have cried it I didn't. No biggie.  
---
But still, if that's really what you call a fulfulling PVP experience, forcing your gameplaying preferences onto unwilling participants, I'm not sure what to say. Telling them how they're allowed to play the game, and tough luck if they leave a PVP unlocked, because you're barging through it.   
---
You seem to have a massive sense of entitlement, and a wish to impose your might on people weaker than yourself. I really hope this is just an online persona, rather than reflecting anything in the real world :(
---
I have no idea about this, but if it's 90% as a mixture of perks (let's say you have a 20%, 30%, 40%) it could be a compounded effect rather than a straight 90% - so you'd take 20% of 100 (80) then take 30% of 80 (56) then 40% of 56 (33.6). You can actually find all this with a generalized formula: 
---
    Given a set of k percentages *P* the compounding effect of the percentages is given by [Multiply Together](1 - *p_i*) for i = 1,..,k
---
So for example, if you layered 20%, 30%, 40% you'd get a total effect of 66% weight reduction.
---
100% for me and my friends. 
---
I had no idea... thank you! 
---
I agree. But it can be done
---
This needs to be upvoted 1000 times.
---
My silo must have been bugged then. I didn't go in with the intention of setting off a nuke, just to check it out. But it was far, far easier than I imagined. I guess it's a good thing I got it done, sounds like I won't be able to do it again. Too bad I got disconnected from the server right after, but at least I got the quest done.
---
lol what pvp?
---
I use one for sqb.  It can spew out bullets fast.
---
Yeah. Like, "Come on dude. I just worked 8 hours at the office and just wanna veg out building my camp. Quit trying to level it." lol
---
Friendly supermutant vendor, wonders and therefore not always easy to find.
---
Should.
---
Won't be.
---
I'm happy.
---
Thank you for more details on your system. I take it once you finish a run through, you don't return until you've changed servers?
---
And I agree, I don't know why, but the metal piles vex me on a personal level. Besides, the one thing I am always short on now is steel for ammo, so it works for me.
---
The blue tags beside his name saying Enclave is a flair not indicating he's from Bethesda hahaha. 
---
I think that'd be sweet, a nice added detail.
---
I agree. There are not enough people who even want to take part in pvp to justify making balance changes that will effect everyone. All that this game needed was private servers. It would have solved many issues people have with this game. This game is very polarized and the only way to at least partially make most everyone happy is to let everyone divide themselves into the groups they want to play in. Now we have entered the realm of nerfing, buffing and balance changes. This is a cycle that can never satisfy the whole community and will likely cause many players to stop playing.
---
Pretty sure gauss rifle is not affected by the bear arms perk despite it being considered a “heavy weapon” for crafting. It seems to take after “rifles” instead from what I have seen [dont quote me on the workbench menu header as it’s been a while since I looked at it]
---
And be sure to take a moment to sit quietly near the door to greet your CAMP when you visit it.
---
Hunting rifles are pretty reliably dropped by mid and low level mobs. Grafton Steel is a good source of a lot of super mutants. Anywhere there's scorched that are mid-ish level.
---
Can’t you just use the Greenbriar bunker like that? I mean you need to join the enclave to use it but who doesn’t want to join the enclave (except the brotherhood but they stink of oil so who cares)
---
Yikes. Thanks for the effort but your numbers are way off and makes this extremely misleading.

I wasn't talking about PvP at all. Simple fact is, melee benefits very strongly from stacking Strength, made easy by perks like Radicool, and has many dedicated consummables with no ranged equivalent (like alcohol and glowing meat steaks). Plus as unarmed you get to double-dip on two 25% damage mutations. Which results in ridonculous damage, before we have to venture into low-HP builds.
---
It needs a nerf. It'll get a nerf. No amount of kicking and screaming (especially at me) is going to stop it. It's coming. Brace yourself.
---
You can't be "one shotted" by a melee weapon. If you are letting a melee person get close to you and kill you when you have a gun, you are just bad at the game. Another one of these cry baby bitching posts today.
---
It's asinine and poorly thought out.
---
As if the game designer is a software engineer and has never played an online game with pvp elements in it before.
---
Lol 
---
I've had mine flattened numerous times, it sucks.
---
I'm at work atm but I have a small Excel spreadsheet listing major things that can be found at marked locations(power armor, plans, enemies,ect) I've only done ~70% of the Forest but would you be interested in this stuff? I can pm it when I'm home
---
Yep, and finding every single nook and cranny.
---
They really did spend a lot of time with detail in the game, there are some stunning places! 
---
Eat it raw
---
Next patch. 
---
I get a fair amount off scorched as well as the super mutants, but i think that can depend on your character level.  If you're too high level they may have moved onto better weapons.
---
Doesn't work with shotgun or gatling gun
---
Pacifist mode only means you are a pacifist it does not effect other players.
---
Don't log off out in the open in a common nuke zone while over-encumbered unless you're willing to lose your junk.  Mean old game forcing you to plan ahead and think things through.
---
I've only had 2 times both when I was obviously inside working on it. Damn kids! *Shakes cane*
---
Yes that part of it is challenging.   Collect..store..sell..dump...repeat  lol
---
It would allow for more roleplay even between players to be honest.  
---
Would also be nice if getting certain mutations together caused them to synergize in a way to be better, and not in the marsupial/birdbones manner (seriously, love how marsupial works, but you jump so high that you take fall damage super easy making bird bones almost required to be with it, perhaps with marsupial the the height of the jump should be removed from the distance fallen calc for fall damage)
---
For example: if you get the 3 'birdy' mutations (eagle eye, talons, birb bones) not only do you get some other more prominant birb features (like say a beak on your face and tail feathers) but also an effect of say....mutant insects flee from you.  This would only be insects, so rad scorpions wouldn't care, and perhaps Honeyed Beasts as they are more along the line of abominations than insects
---
Or scaly skin + talons + chameleon for the 'lizard' or 'gecko' mutation, which could give a 'climb' ability allowing you to walk on walls and such
---
There are alot of posibilities but would take some serious testing and work, it'd just be nice for much more....interesting interactions as opposed to purely mechanical ones
---
There always has been a lot of critical dicks when fallout is concerned.
---
\&gt; I don't have to be the hero of my story. 
---
But the game doesn't even give you the option to be.  Whether you want to admit it or not, there is  a clear end game, which is nuking fissure site prime and destroying the scorched beast queen.
---
In which case you are 1 of about 8-10 people who helped to take her down.  But you are NEVER the hero who destroyed the queen.  You are just one gun among many. 
---
&gt; I could go help out with what the Overseer asked for, or I could do it in my own way.  
---
Which is what exactly? What is your own way? Skipping the overseers quest and collecting weapons/ junk and killing scorched, etc.?   What options in this game actually exist other than following the overseers quests or free roam shooting/ looting? 
---
Like many others, you complain that Fallout 4 gives your character a back story and you alone can't decide who the character is. 
---
Okay.
---
You think Fallout 76 is better because it  gives you a blank slate and nothing to fill it in with?  
---
The only significant choice in this game is where to drop the nuke. You an nuke fissure site prime and kill the queen for rare loot, nuke white springs and farm for legendaries, or nuke places like Dyer chemical  and basically get nothing. 
---
&gt;  I could be some bumbling tradesman, or a mercenary for hire, or i could join one of the various groups and not feel like I have to be attached. 
---
And how many people have hired you so far to do mercenary hits?  If you join the various groups, who sends you on missions? No one because everyone is dead. 
---
I don't have a problem with people liking this game, but people who criticized Fallout 4 for lack of role playing while embracing this game are beyond me. 
---
Level 1-25 ghouls, then decon them. Hit up farms around the starting area, server jump if they're bugs and not ghouls.
---
It won't take you long! 
---
 You have zero clue what you are talking about a two shot hardened pump explosive shotgun does 428 damage. Thats without demo expert. Add demo expert perk card and it does 643 damage plus any other perks. Max I can get fully perked is 961. 
---
Melee is hitting over 3k and will be the next nerf once the community starts pushing it saying its op.
---
This game is very, very far from dead at the moment. 
---
No.  Another one of these cry baby bitching posts today of "they took my toy, you can't have yours too". 
---
&gt; Those TSE weapons were mostly the reason you were able to down a SBQ easily
---
Yeah, the SBQ dying in 15 seconds was probably too easy. Cry me a river if it takes five minutes now.
---
Who said "slippery slope"? Talk about loonie, you Canadian $1 coin. 
---
Ill be glad when they remove vats teleporting and youll be back here posting too. 
---
Haven't done proper testing with AP legendary mod so can't really comment. If you don't notice a difference on, say, super mutants sth should indeed be wrong. 
---
Disasgreeing on the long range thing though. You can fairly reliably hit precise short bursts with the .50 and the Gatling gun is almost pinpoint accurate, especially once you get a feeling for the aim. If you can see it without the scope you can hit it, basically. 
---
The TS .50 makes even distances such as be bigger rooms in the nuke bunkers problematic when you want to hit, say, the turrets at distance or if partially obscured. It does more damage on paper but takes as long as the non-TS one I have. It does absolutely shred things once close though.
---
Your TSE is still going to be one of the better weapons in the game.  I expect only Bloody builds(particularly melee) will drastically surpass it.  And guaranteed those are next on the chopping block.
---
Wow, didn't know the wood ones could be locked, but I tested and couldn't jump thru .. nice one .. I try leave my place unlocked, but good to know :)
---
The "perfectly logical progression of events" isn't really a perfectly logical progression of events. It's a slippery slope......
---
Carrot soup.  
---
Nope.  
---
A well meant "thank you" for saving me the wood scrap.
---
&gt;  There is no endgame.
---
But there are, paradoxically, many many spoons.
---
Matpat, what are you doing?
---
Not an undertale theory somehow
---
&gt; Melee is hitting over 3k
---
Oh is this thread about melee now?
---
Melee deals so much damage because of low-life builds, unyielding armor and the bloodied legendary. That's a separate topic and yes I'm fairly sure it will be on the nerfing block shortly.
---
&gt; You can fairly reliably hit precise short bursts with the .50
---
Depends on the model of the mob you're shooting at.
---
&gt; Gatling gun is almost pinpoint accurate
---
**????????????????!** My .50 cal is ***far*** more accurate than my gatling gun.
---
This personal attack is exactly what I meant in my post. Why would **I** have a sense of entitlement for **BETHESDA** coding pvp into the game? Honestly, if you were wanted and someone killed you and took your junk, then the game was working as intended by the developers. If you are wanted, mistakenly or not, the first thing you should do is stash your junk, be prepared to lose any subsequent you might pick up, and probably seek a high player count area in hopes that one will kill you because the QoL debuffs aren't fun to keep on for any amount of time. You shot someones base and say I'm forcing my playstyle on you? Sorry if I"m less than empathetic but you did a bad boy thing and got bad boy killed. Most people agree thats how the game should work.
---
I have never once disagreed that victory often comes in the form of who has better gear (its actually written in my post). In fact I hope gear is more balance but in the end any game with RNG gear is going to have some stronger players and some weaker ones. Just how it is.
---
Thank you very much for clarification! 
---
I crashed 6 times in a row, all of them in less than 1 minute of getting into a world
---
It’d help if Bethesda just got better about that in general.
---
Also this has shown me I can’t go running into events to claim bounties because it’s a dick move to kill someone who can’t fight back.
---
Basically you need the same amount of points of each card in your tree. So if you have 5 points, you can equip either 5 x 1 point cards, 2 x 2 point cards + 1 point or 1 x 2 point and a 3 point card etc. I wouldn't limit yourself on any tree unless you have a specific build. If you don't know, I would focus on charisma as your main trees and decide, I tried to have at least 5 points on each tree, but it really depends on your build, I have seen people with only 1 point and I think I have 3 under endurance. It's kind a stupid, I shouldn't limit you and switching out cards is tedious and sucks.
---
Pick them all up, be seriously overencumbered, and ask everyone around where the nearest workbench is located.
---
Wouldn't a toxic carebear just be a RadBear?
---
Lmao, I don't use vats on players or even enemies. So that doesn't bother me.
---
And another one who doesn't read the text and understands it how he should have been.
---
Also incapable of grasping the real issue behind the whole explosive weapons issue. 
---
What are you going to do once this nerf hits and then people realize how OP melee can be? Are you screeching for a nerf for those too then? Or for the Cryolator being able to nearly pause the fight on the ground against her? 
---
But if it makes you feel better. If you would have spend time reading the thread and would have tried to understand it, i said that i am not against a nerf. Just the TSE  nerf itself is over the top and punishes players who farmed for it fair and square. 
---
Is the show that good? Uhg i need my wife to watch something besides my 600 pound life and the voice...
---
I am a hoarder 4lyfe. Iv got 4 mule characters...
---
Anyone wanna buy some steel?
---
Yes, you can learn to make a Cramburger, but it comes from Recipe: Delbert's Bunless Cramburger, and not from Recipe: Cramburge. Recipe: Cramburger exists in the game data files but is not in the game.
---
That was a waste of atoms, you can get the fusion generator plans from any of the nuclear plant events.
---
Meta is shifting already, after the TSE shotgun mess  ( which we could build around with fireproof and dense mods ), it's now TS lever action. Was trying it out with friends and they were 2 shotting me. Although i am using a bloodied build so 2 shots isn't actually that bad.
---
It's not TSE killing the SBQ in 15 seconds, it's stacked bobbleheads with the curator perk exploit. 
---
Thanks......now i really want a fancy magic table :/ lol
---
I agree about the camp thing, even though it the end its not that much to repair but there should still be mutual hostility before damaging player structures except for workshops IMO
---
Yeah I have found three doors inaccessible so far but not the nuka cola plan yet.
---
Lot of the melee naysayers are just clumping a lot of factors into one. Perks and such and enemy AI are more to “blame” than the actual melee damage. Like I said, being able to stand in front of enemies and beat on them is not a problem with the build. Now for PVP you’d have to be pretty stealthy to get that close, so TSE vs melee there is no contest and not even comparable.
---
 Maybe switch servers next time instead of watching them drop 12 consecutive orbital strikes on your camp.
---
Maybe that's what table is? Idk I can't find it!
---
&gt; players who farmed for it fair and square. 
---
So nobody? 
---
Nice build! Where on the map did you set this up?
---
Nope, it's not even necessary to exploit.
---
One dropped last night! Woot!
---
It does not poke through. However, it's got the bug where if there's a floor or roof above, it will either not place or will snap *up* onto the floor/roof above.
---
You have no game. You're a weirdo going on a random games sub and talking shite. 
---
Because they also coded PVE, and avoidance of PVP. Deliberately. They advertised it on the basis that PVP was supposedly 100% consensual. I have no problem if you want to go off and PVP to your heart's content, but you seem to think that I should't be able PVE without risking PVP? Do you really think PVP should have people accidentally becoming targets? Is that really what you want from PVP? Unwilling, unequipped, unprepared, inexperienced targets for you to pump full of lead?
---
haha alot of people don't know about that larger brick window. I used it as my door in my old camp. People would be so confused. Was a great illusion, and creatures can't get in. Neat! 
---
Or just use alt mules. Is what i do with my friends.
---
Ok. I’m on Xbox and from what I’ve gathered it makes a difference but here you go-  
---
1. Play for a while on a server, while you are doing that track other players on your server, pay special attention to players that are “invested” in the server, like workshops or high level players in the nuke silos, or low level players in the forest (they don’t tend to server hop)or basically anyone that looks like they are going to be around. What you’re trying to avoid is players who are server hopping and players that don’t look like they’ll be around when you try to transfer items.  
---
2. Once you are comfortable enough that you’ve found some players that will be there when transfer you’ll want to pull up the social menu, highlight your selected players and make sure that they can be joined (on Xbox players will frequently show themselves “as Offline”, making it so you can’t join on them). I highly recommend writing down names just in case.  
---
3. Find a low traffic unmarked location in the forest with world containers and sneak your way there so nobody will snipe your gear.  
---
4. Double check your map/social tab to ensure your “anchor” player(s) Are still there. Place items in container.  
---
5. Log out. Select character you’re transferring item to. Go to the social tab, find your anchor player and pull up their profile, select join game.  
---
6. Load in and go to your container and retrieve your items.  
---
Couple of additional things- if the server seems laggy don’t do it. Find a more stable server. Also, scorched and super mutants will pick up your items if the are in the area and the appropriate level, keep that in mind, you can kill them to get them back but they’ll be almost broken.  
---
I’ve done this method around 20 times transferring items between my 4 builds with 100% success rate.  
---
Hope this helps!
---
Does he know you're splitting up with him? That's a tough way to tell him.
---
Loaded with two missiles the weight makes sense
---
I wouldn't mind seeing bounties increase if the player fast travels, but still allow normal free travel to CAMPs, Workshops, and Vault 76. Makes it more worthwhile for the bounty hunters if the bounty tries to run.
---
K well now im gona have take all the workshops on every server i visit on a quest for the one and only "fancy magic table" plans if i find them ill let you know
---
I'm a bit slow, but here's the current set I'm using.
---
https://imgur.com/9muToTq
---
I'd also love for it to fit in 1 foundation square.
---
Right.  People are underestimating just how much damage is possible in this game.  TSE was just cruise control.  You could do extremely high damage without thinking or putting much effort in.  Just get your dupe and you're good.
---
I'm not even convinced TSE was the best damage, just the easiest.
---
No problems on PC. Been online for about 4 hours roughly.
---
Yeah, it's just that this myth (that bulking reduces weight for things other than aluminum and lead) has been nearly wiped out. Just every so often someone gathers some imperfect data and starts spreading the myth again.
---
But yeah, no bulk increases weight currently so there's not really not a hard downside to it. It will SLIGHTLY lower weight technically since it consumes plastic (which you don't get back when unbulking), but you'd save just as much if you just threw away 2 units of plastic for everything you planned on bulking.
---
Also be aware of this. I've heard that bulk junk is low on the priority list for crafting. I believe it bumps priority to below mods. So if you need steel and you just have mods with steel or bulk steel, it'll eat the mods first.
---
Damage resistance isn’t a percentage and is more curved around the size of the incoming attack, so a damage resistance of 50 will take a lot more than 50% off of a 10 point incoming attack but a lot less than 50% off of a 100 point incoming attack.  This is why big slow attacks in this game are so good (in addition to using less ammo and needing fewer repairs)
---
In order to be confusing, your ballistic/physical damage resistance is called just “damage resistance”, even though energy resistance is also a kind of resistance to a kind of damage.  Notice Barbarian provides more DR per attribute point than Evasive, but Evasive provides both DR and ER.  Your current damage resistance, energy resistance, and radiation resistance are on the first page of the “STAT” tab in your pip boy (but using symbols: the damage resistance has a crosshair, energy is a lighting bolt, and radiation is radiation symbol)
---
As far as I know, damage resistance works in Fallout 76 like it does in Fallout 4, so maybe read up on the Fallout 4 section here:

You on xb1? Hate to fight over magic tables 
---
I don't even use food anymore.  I roll with the Carnivore mutation and Cannibalism Perk.  Water comes from my purifier and I swear I somehow always have about 30+ bottles on me.
---
And if you read the post, I didn't do a 'bad boy thing', just the a single stray bullet was the only plausible solution I had for why I suddenly had a 10c bounty out of nowhere. I suppose it could've just as easily been a server spasm not registering the pacifist tag.
---
If explosive users haven't learnt to slot fireproof rank 3, and dense mods by now then they deserve to self own.
---
Mmmhm. If you say so. Everyone has a TSE these days... still see 20 minute battles. It has more to do with the low levels sitting in the shed or hiding in the post. I suppose if it was JUST a 4 man party with TSE perked out, it could go faster. But if you're talking about a kill under 5 mins you experienced a bobblehead stacker, whether you knew it or not. 
---
I am my teams crafter. I spend my day collecting junk and raw meat and veggies, craft ammo, cook food, and upgrade and repair guns, armor, and PA for my team. I know how to make almost every recipe, mod, weapon, and armor in the game. Some are still missing though, very elusive, like Raider armor/PA, sturdy/heavy armor, and most PA parts and mods.
---
Sorry for late reply but already payed for it off another user
---
What about close by? That happened to me and someone wasn’t on my spot, but close enough for the green to overlap. No?
---
He didn't even spread his wings. Just creeped about like a Caterpillar. I didnt notice him. I spammed vats as usual and crept around while looking everywhere since you know first time headed to grafton. I kill 3 radstags that were hanging about. I went to collect meat from one, crouch and see "danger". I'm hella spooked so I look around and see a giant pair of red eyes looking back at me maybe 50 meters away.  Mothman. I back away slowly since its mothman and like 20 levels over mine. He stares at me the whole time until he tires and goes the other way. I head to grafton train station and loot a little/sell some stuff.
---
Step out and there he is. About 75 meters away. Staring at me. Big red eyes. Motionless. With the cover of the train station (and a room I know I can lock myself in if I need to) I take potshots at him. He does nothing and just stares at me the whole time. I was even getting sneak bonus. So I basically shot him 75 times till he died
---
Might be new. I'll test it.
---
I’m aware, I know that’s an option I just haven’t found the plans yet haha
---
Slippery slope doesn't mean what you think it means. Nothing of what I said was a slippery slope, because there was no increase in magnitude of the changes, just a logical progression of changes based on relative performance.
---
 TSE weapons produced unreasonably high, AoE damage, often from unintended range (due to no damage falloff in explosive damage, unlike in projectile damage). They are getting nerfed. Nothing unusual or illogical there. Once they are done, melee is next worst offender. Arguably, melee should have been first, it's just that melee isn't AoE damage, and short range, and therefore not as egregious. And not as reliant on itemization. TSE was all about he items, melee will be a more complex situation, with nerfs to mutations and perks (most likely Incisor and Martial Artist, both are ubiquitous in melee builds), not just weapons. Next step after that will likely be Low-HP builds, they generate a lot of damage, but require more attention, less room for error. And so on, and so forth.  
---
What will be happening in the next little while is Bethesda cutting off the peaks and filling in the valleys in performance. If something is overperforming, they will bring it down. If something is underperforming, they will bring it up. Eventually, ideally, everything will be closer to the baseline. That's how balance works. 
---
If you're saying that Beth should code out damage to player structures with pacifist on then I have no problem with that. They'd also have to remove getting a bounty for lockpicking another players items. Then there would be NO way you could receive a bounty with pacifist on and you'd never risk pvp unless you went to a workshop to claim it. If that really is what you're saying, then I see no problem with that, seems fair.
---
Did they tell you what they banned you for?
---
It doesn’t seem to produce smoke and that prevents the lag drops

After patch this week I get infinite load screen after entering new area.  95% have been after fast travel but also happened opening door to glass cavern.  Shows picture from my travels and loading wheel continues to spin and tips on bottom change, but never recovers.
---
The best-known method of duping was patched, the method involved dc'ing and rolling back an individual character.  
---
You can still dupe if you crash and roll back and entire server which is unfortunately what we are seeing. I doubt dupers account for 100% of the server crashes, but I do know the definitely account for some of them.
---
If it's real im pretty sure it's just a joke.  You can't kill vendors and enemies can't kill them either. 
---
Yea this would be amazing. although a total account stash would have to be set kind of low.  i can see people abusing the crap out of a total stash like that. 
---
Your welcome. Hope it helps! 
---
You should keep only 2 chassis. One that you carry along in your inventory and are able to use if needed. Another one in your inventory, use it to store the good level 50 parts you come along but are not able to use yet. I was able to buy a jetpacked x01 chest below level 40, so it waits in my stash till i hit 50 someday. That chest alone is around 25lbs, stored on the chassis it only takes up 10lbs. 4 chassis is overkill imo, just make a plan of the locations you come across or use a PA map, there are plenty online. 
---
You’re welcome! 
---
It's still a very good combo. Not as much as before, but still good.
---
It sucks but don't let dickbags dictate how you should play or enjoy the game, just know it can happen and keep an eye on your camp when you not home. Also pick a more isolated spot if this reoccurs and people won't bother travelling out of the way because they lazy or make sure there are no fast travel points close by. Also get the contractor perk to level 2 so it is cheaper to repair. Also don't accept invites from randoms, some of them just want to know where your camp is.
---
If someone is approaching or camp or starts destroying it, log off immediately and it will disappear. 
---
if you are afk in your camp, get some chameleon armour and crouch and you will become invisible on the map. People tend to go towards people who aren't moving, I had 3 high levels heading my direction when I noticed them all in PA, I crouched and they straight away changed direction when I disappeared off the map and went somewhere else. They could of been friendly, but unlikely.
---
The other thing you can do but is a bit tedious, is block everyone on the server, so they all become invisible to you and you to them. You can still enjoy it, you just need to be 1 step ahead of the douche bags. 
---
I did have two douche bags show up at my camp when I had 1 of my other characters sitting still, I was actually arriving back at the camp with my other character and saw them shooting up the place, I immediately logged off with my primary character, they still did some damage but could of been worse, I blocked, reported with both my characters, so they got 2 reports for their crime. I then hung around, then 1 of them tried to kill me but I kept drinking water, I could see him trying different guns, it was hilarious, they weren't able to kill me, they eventually moved on. Twats.
---
I have only had 1 incident so far. On a positive note, I had a couple of players show up while I was on the phone, I went oh no here we go again. But they built some stuff (Red rocket at my camp) and we have become very good friends, so it depends, most people are nice.
---
90% if players are peaceful and friendly, you just have to keep your eye on the rest, there are some really nice people around so don't let this deter you. We should be getting pvp servers soon, so hopefully these trolls will move on, maybe we will then get a true passive mode at the same time.
---
No I had to start a new game. It worked with mt srcond character.
---
Same crap that happened in ark the pvp nerfs got in the way of pve
---
I have found three doors that are inaccessible near black mountain ordnance and having trouble finding the right one I have all the keys.
---
"Excessively high rate of item creation." Seems like their automated system is accusing me of duping. My best guess is that it's from all the bullets I make or the stuff I've stolen and dropped from dupers.
---
My base will be more secured. Even though my foundations are mega high and I have a towering 3 story house, I will lock down the first floor at least.
---
I found a TSE Gauss rifle when I was grinding for a good handmade or lever rifle.  Gave it to a friend.  She disconnected once while we were playing with another friend and sure enough left a little paper bag at her feet with her legendary in it.  I grabbed it quick and gave it back to her, and she's not had a problem since.  
---
I'm sorry your gun is gone. 
---
Also plagues my heavy weapons toon. I had 6 of them because of a bug they kept multiplying every time I logged on. I got tired of deleting them. Now they're all bugged.
---
Lol. There is no spoon either, if you've ever watched the Matrix.
---
Why not submit the appeal anyhow? It's like, minutes of your time at most, right?
---
What is there to lose?
---
So if melee needs a nerf what do you suggest?  As you mentioned a lot of things go into making that super duper OP build. So nerf all those things?  Just keep nerfing all the perks and such until it’s equal to the new TSE damage? How do you nerf the fact you gotta be in melee range to do any of these things vs. bang you’re dead.
---
Kerfustamuble. Yes it’s as bad as it sounds, I think. 
---
Its simple. All the salty little bastards who duped or bought their tse are having a shit fit and throwing ALL their toys from the pram with the same mentality that makes them think they are gods of fallout because they stack bobbleheads, one shot people who have been legit farming for their junk then get their little friends to kill them and disconnect. Its a pure and orgasmic outpouring of salty goodness and i for one am loving it!! Even if you got a tse from a legit drop, the damage is done and you just gta live with the stigma that everyone you encounter will straight up think you got your weapon like a punk from a duper. These are facts lol
---
3 crashes all while fighting the queen and all within 60 seconds of loading back in
---
I dont think its a bad move, those people dont want to play together anyways, so why bot seperste them? You wont see the difference with only, what is it? 8 per server at the moment? I mean it would make a sifference if we all played in the same server.
---
grind? welcome to video games. 
---
I can relate. I remember opening up vendor inventory and seeing "Plans: Bladed". Bladed what? Bladed board? Bladed bat? Bladed glove? Bladed dick?! As if we needed more evidence of dev laziness, they couldn't be assed to type in 2-3 more words?
---
really it would be 20(launcher)+3(missile1)+3(missile2)+1(mod)=27
---
He's getting off easy.
---
Actually A LOT  of people went crazy for super sledges and deathclaw gauntlets. I got offered over 20k for an instigating, faster swing speed, +1 super sledge. There are many, many posts in trading subreddits for these melee weapons. They were going bonkers for it.

This is where the Card System fails for me. Sure, OP can remove his Contractor card and run Gunsmith at all times. Then he has to go in every time he plans to base-build and swap cards.
---
I was hoping for a more permanent skill system like we've seen previously. There's no point in running multiple characters as it is right now.
---
Did u get a bladed dick? 
---
Nah ps4, we good lol
---
Bibble.
---
I don’t use the targeting HUD though. I don’t even use power armor! 
---
Slippery slope doesn't mean what you think it means.
---
Everything you've outlined is a progression inevitably resulting in "if one then all" of all the builds. Explosive damage was nerfed in Fallout 4 and there was no reason to nerf melee.
---
If they nerf TSE and stop because your "peaks and valleys" are filled with VATS crit builds and bloodied laser guns.... It's done. There is no further escalation.
---
Be on the look out for a bladed dick as well lol 
---
Derp
---
Though I do gain 2-3 levels in those losing fights from all the scorched on the ground. I'm not too worried since if it does become too hard they'd probably address it in another patch.
---
My vampire's walking cane seems to do about double the damage of my two-shot .44, despite having about half the damage number. So I do think ranged needs some additional balancing, not that I'd expect a pistol to compete with gatling guns or anything.
---
Let’s have a moment of silence for je6100
---
Was killed and eaten can confirm. . .
---
I didn't know this mine is on top of my backyard bunker surrounded by defense walls
---
Because I'm not in any rush to get back into the game. I'd rather hear about other peoples experience.
---
real life times have nothing to do with drops, sorry for the late response, bombs dropped around halloween so that’s why these are a thing

"I've got a weapon for every situation. Hunting, protection, cold blooded murder, HOT blooded murder."
---
But were you able to kill/loot her? 
---
Its boot really a fight.

Send a ticket

If you want anyone to pay the slightest amount of attention to your posts, try actually paying attention to punctuation. No one's going to bother with you if they have to read your post three times to figure out what you were saying.
---
Ah the fabled "cockknife" plans
---
You don't have to is the thing I could prolly do the same thing with 20 or 30 rounds from a shotgun with no perks, it's not hard to do damage. If your thinking you should be able to oneshot rooms full of high level mobs I'm sorry but no you sacrifice that level of damage for range.
---
Appreciate it but this game is dead for me until the next DLC is out
---
Yeah fighting three supermutants. I saved it and it was immediately hostile.
---
I've absolutely no idea why they made CAMPs destructible by PCs anyway. Probably just as a sop to griefing PVPers like you.   
---
You're not a proper PVPer, you're just a bottom feeding griefer who's getting salty about being called out on it. You're not gonna convince anyone you're interested in the honourable consensual realm of competitive PVP when mere hours before you're boasting like this:

Thanks for the insight, I happen to be a raider myself haha. Lately for fun I have been RP’ing as a “bounty hunter” hunter. Get a bounty, go to vault 76, wear dense armor and fireproof. After you survive their initial shot they’ll be so stunned and it’s an easy kill after that. Many times it’s high level people who don’t even bother to stash their junk first and also pride over dying so they seek revenge several times as well. I’ve farmed several thousand caps and a fair bit of junk in an hour using this method but I like the workshop thing your describing better!"
---
You can run around in empty PA until level 15, at level  15 get the Raider Power Armour which is cool and strong, so from 15-25, you can use PA armour. At level 25 you can decide to use T45 or Excavator PA.
---
I loved my Raider PA, it still up well against the scorchbeast, just isn't pretty but sure is strong at least I thought it was. Just building two characters and can't wait to play in some Raider PA again
---
Is stacking bobbleheads cheating now? 
---
My friends list wont even populate.
---
See, that all sounds awesome.
---
I considered suggesting that only the super mutations could alter looks but pretty much the exact way you described the bird mutation.
---
The gecko idea is also awesome.  Maybe instead of being able to walk on walls the player could stick to it?  Being able to walk on walls *might* be too op but I like the idea still.
---
Talons, Twisted Muscles, and Healing Factor could make your character look like Hugh Jackman.
---
Rules of the wasteland....rules of the wasteland.
---
Wonder if they got their values mixed up. 
---
Super sledges and Excavator Power Armors as far as the eye can see. Love when I see those guys, super original build.
---
I think you can find the key on the bridge as well, in the middle or does this key unlock a different door ?
