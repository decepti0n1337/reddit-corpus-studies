We need some sort of key ring where all of our keys go to, that way we don't have to see all they keys and cards we have (but we can if we want just by opening it) and doors still open if we have the key

that is wholesome as heck.

Get rank 1 of four leaf clover instead. IIRC you get a 7% percent chance for rank one and only 2.5% more for each additional rank.
---
Yes boi
---
huge shotgun lover I still collect them for the day they come back in style
---

---
just like how my friends mocked me for my anti armor energy weapon collection but who is laughing now....
---
Started with shotguns. It's been awhile. I do miss them. Funny, becuase they can work in NW

Since I first ran into her, I've wished there were companions in this game. Plus building/repairing robots. I'd love to loot a Colonel Gutsy and build her a new combat-oriented body.
---
I saw one while I was doing a hunter hunted in survival mode. I got so scared, then I one shot it with my TS Gauss
---
Take 1 of better crits and the one that reduces crit bar consumption.  You‚Äôll be critting every third shot.
---
I found tormented situationally good but by and large ignored it.
---
Thanks for the reply I have checked  The volume settings and unfortunately it‚Äôs all the tapes for me that I can‚Äôt hear the very very silent take some days whispering I think I‚Äôm going to uninstall the game and then reinstall it and see if that fixes it thank you once again
---
Or the option to sort by newest. I‚Äôd love that fur Holo tapes.
---
This sometimes happens if you don‚Äôt loot everything on it
---
I got an anti armor explosive handmade from the legendary vendor also a couple days ago. Was trying to roll an explosive shotgun for my raider character but guess I'll have an automatic build now XD. 
---
Congrats, hold on to that thing for dear life.
---
Keys are weightless so i don't care about those. But the stash thing could be useful.
---
That's weird. Hope it works for you.
---
I can‚Äôt imagine this game having solid and fun pvp when things like marsupial, stealthboys and bloodied Tesla‚Äôs exist
---
[removed]
---
Yes, happened with the Queen and a SB when I just walked to Watoga from Scorched Earth ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
:,(
---
Yep. It‚Äôs random, seems like it‚Äôs been happening since the beta.
---
Idk. I think it's just making them more like real shotguns. Massive massive damage for about 2 meters, tse lever action with full rifleman (my reference point) level damage until about 25 feet, and normal hardened handmade damage until about 30 feet. Useless past there.
---
Do it. No balls!
---
Yes this is actually super cool. Wow.
---
Server hopped 3 nights in a row for hours seeing no one at the meat cook or PC several times. Grinding for s heavy tapped keg on a stop sign isn‚Äôt worth it unless your going for XP or the occasional legendary 1*. PS4 also noticed something else. No higher lvl in the servers, no one with armor in vending machines and some servers were ghost towns. I‚Äôve asked some team mates and they‚Äôve noticed it as well. I did see a sub saying that ppl were waiting for meat week to end before playing again because of lag and server crashes.
---
I feel like 1 Deathclaw should be as troublesome as a 3 Yao Guai
---
Will it be a new game?
---
Without a persistent world I don't see how it would be possible to have anything but that same game. I expect a lot of "go here, fight that, pretend it affected the world".
---
I actually hate when people talk about their SO if they don‚Äôt activity play with my group on games.
---
Had a guild leader on World of Warcraft talk about how ‚Äúher and her hubby played WoW and it was so cute‚Äù Like good job but every time I go into discord I don‚Äôt want to hear about it.
---
I understand this and i think it‚Äôs NOT okay for people to do it if their heterosexual either, that shits still annoying as hell.
---
I think it's pretty much the same problem for any lists over a certain size in any software.
---
I mean there are UIX solutions that are decades old at this point.
---
Good ways to filter, and an outright search function, please.
---
YES!
---
Ive done sunshine too amd i loot people
---
It helps to think that they really did have a lot of cool things planned from the very beginning.
---
But stash boxes are universal, you can access your stash from any box. How would that work if you had multiple stashes? And also, there are category tabs for your items already in your stash box.
---
I think this is an amazing idea! I haven‚Äôt really thought about the idea of a big PVP/PVE fight against two factions. Reading this is making me think back to when I played ESO and we would have the war PVP mode in Cyrodiil where it‚Äôs a huge all out war with the three main factions that involved castles and strongholds and just all out war as well as siege weapons. I think a game mode like this would be great in FO76 or at the least an attempt at it. I‚Äôm not sure if you got the inspiration from ESO but I want this.
---
I run a bloodied VATS rifle build and all I'm running on luck is bloody mess 3, Serendipity 3, starched genes and class freak. Those mutations are worth far more than a perk card on luck
---
Oh, it's not much of a problem with the actual BBQ.  It's Prime Cuts events, mostly in the Bog and Divide, where this comes up.
---
The BBQ itself, there's no real need to share kills, so you just VATS and shoot at any critters you see, and VATS periodically just to see if it picks anything up.
---
The same thing happened to me yesterday I was able to kill the guy but finally saw ome.
---
I think this is the incentive to have a massive clear out...
---
What I hope for- Raiders, BOS members attacking mutated vault dwellers, Chem Addicts, different classes of Chinese robots maybe?
---
I suspect it's a percentage of total HP.  Like, on my low-level, I have to put way more shots into the Deathclaw and Yao Guai in the Forest Prime Cuts than I do the Wolves for it to count.  The Savage Divide version, I rarely deal enough damage on those Yao Guai, so it's just wasted bullets.
---
The quest wont trigger with tech data in your stash, you must pick it up in the environment to reactivate it
---
Does this exclude all of the perk card packs you get along the way? Because you can‚Äôt know the exact number with the random generation of those cards, right?
---
Yes and yes. We need a better organization, like for junk and shit. Also, I wish keys you don't need anymore would just disappear, besides the miner's locker key.
---
that is just plugging it straight into nukes&amp;dragons.. so youre correct.. it would be a bit less than that..
---
And how about seperate space for food in the inventory!
---
Well I wouldn‚Äôt say that it makes too much sense that the cryolator had plans. It felt more just like a side project the overseer cooked up because of boredom. And the overseer died inside the vault with the cryolator locked inside so there is no way the people of Appalachia could replicate it. I think that the atlas observatory links too well with big mt‚Äôs meteorological center and thus hopewell because of its connection with big mt and the fact that they both have silos with nukes that create orange fallout and not green and have small aoes. If we can assume that the government is keeping notes with the big mt on both of their weather controlling experiments and that hopewells nukes may come from Appalachias silo factories, it shows a possible explanation for the red glare to be in 76. Also given the amount of strikes in Appalachia that creates a plausible cause for the government to distribute riot armor to strike breakers especially since the mining industry is needed for the war effort.
---
I wouldn't do that.  But given their reputation, Deathclaws deserve to be at least as dangerous as the Sheepsquatch is.  And the only reason they aren't is because they are often dead before they can get their attacks off.
---
It's the same reason why there's almost universal agreement than Yao Guai are super dangerous.  Their attacks hit like a truck and they have the HP to get in and use them.
---

---
Counterpoint: If it's really that obvious, why do you need arrows at all?
---
Same happened to me. It said i was out of ammo, my clip in both guns had been full. I had 14k each kind of ammo. I ended up switching servers.
---
I think you need to craft some ultracite cores...
---
Ultracite Gatling Laser uses Fusion Cores, not Plasma Cores
---
Harsh, but true. üëç
---
The filter already exists in the transfer menu doesn't it? Weapons, apparel etc. What we need is a way to tag a filter to a storage item of choice and only be able to transfer that class of item. Other wise you could end up with lost items, like putting apparel in the weapons box and being unable to see it again, but still use storage space. Maybe a simple see all option when we set the class of storage could sort that issue out too!
---
.
---
Cool, did you find out how many ships you have?
---
Well, silly me XD Totally could be user error but here's where I get confused because I don't have fusion cores on me right now.
---
31 flavors of confused!
---
Ok fair.
---
Yeah me too. Maybe one of their facilities teleported or just walked away and over to Appalachia.
---
I usually stuck to the south west last event.  Almost no one ever showed up, plus I‚Äôd rather have acid than any other dropped materials. It was just a challenge to kill the sheepsquatch fast enough.
---
Edit:
---
I‚Äôd only use ammo for the initial pull when I saw crickets on the ridge.
---
Yup had a SB and a supply drop both following me everywhere I went. The supply drop actually blocked the door to my camp so I couldn‚Äôt get in. It was quite funny since there was also a dead SB flopping around on my roof.
---
I have been playing my junkies pistol character so I just try and tag everything for loot and XP. It's timed so I doubt I could kill everything on my own in time anyway, so help is welcome
---
What critical build would you recommend other than four-leaf clover?
---
And add a few posed ones.
---
Can you live longer with ghoulish in the fire? If so, how much longer?
---
Lol glad it‚Äôs not just me then
---
Claiming workshops and doing the events related to them, like defending them, will always reward you with a random plan for base building.
---
Basiclly forever if you come out every 2 min or so to refresh the burning i basically can camp on a house 50 meeters from circle and move in after it closes
---
It's not a lot of damage you need to do but I had hit the hermit crab a few times and didn't get loot, this happened a few times. So it may be a small percentage as those crabs have a lot of hp
---
Four leaf clover is pretty essential, but grim reaper sprint, concentrated fire, gun th. Just vats perks really. And and vats prefix legendary shotgun.
---
Mines instigating, 25% less AP coat and extra bash. It's a lot of fun.
---
Non of you bloodied hater have ever ran into me on
---
Ps4. Im bloodied still.  I pvp everyday!
---
Only people that kill me easyish is gamma guns. 
---
Ymb_loki509
---
Hopewell is getting their nukes from the west coast. Given that tensions were high and war could happen at any moment. The gov isn‚Äôt going to transport nukes across the country. Too pricey, too risky. 
---
I said it was plausible that plans were made. Anyone making anything is going to make notes, diagrams, parts list, something. Also cryo weapons already exist in the world for fallout. Fire protectrons have cryo jets, and grenades and mines exist. So saying one cryo gun can only exist is foolish in a way. 
---
Also we know the government is/was keeping up with bigMT. It‚Äôs there biggest research center. 
---
We don‚Äôt know where red glare was made it could just be a few models and nothing else. 
---
Most of the riots in Appalachia were stopped by army not police. That‚Äôs not to say they didn‚Äôt try but given the semi poor state we see in Appalachia root armour may not have been affordable for PD‚Äôs
---
Firstly, do you know for sure all the places where people spawn in? Check that if you run to the camp from each of these, AND the vending machines are not visible, the FIRST thing you see is a vault-boy pointing to the shortest path to the machines.
---
Better still, put the machines on the side facing the spawn point. If you have the misfortune of placing the CAMP on top of the spawn point, understand that players will be mightily confused a to where to go.
---
Finally, some players are just a bit slow on the uptake... I have everything I just mentioned above, and some people just charge inside my shack looking for them...
---
Big skills right there...

The fridge even though we have storage so it wouldn't surprise me if they charged us for a way to display outfits or even our power armors.
---
Bloodied build with a pocket full of radshield ,your gamma gun is next to useless
---
I've seen him 3 times and I'm at about 550 hours. I've spotted him twice in the Mire and once in the Forest at the unmarked high ropes course.
---
Are you an X Box player? I could trade you one of a few shotguns for that if you want.
---
Two ranks of starched genes at lvl 31 to lock down your mutations.
---
It is because of the random fast travel points. If only we had travel mats...
---
This also happens to me with the supply drop crates from Collision Course if the bug where more than one drops occurs. They stalk me whenever I fast travel and end up on and inside people's CAMPs. I feel bad about leaving a trail of them but the only fix is hopping servers.
---
Do the Meat Week things that are going on in the game now. I've got a lot of XP in the last couple days. I've leveled up about 11 times so far. And also like someone else said, kill super mutants in between.
---
I've only had it when there are people doing a vault raid on my server, so now I just hop servers when I see people in  vault 94...
---
I noticed the terracotta tiled floor. I want it!
---
The instrument, or the junk item? Where did you get it? Screenshot?
---
I'll second that. Faschnat should have come back first. Best part of meat week is filling stock of harder to get materials.
---
YES PLEASE!
---
Aww, don't say that! I can't tell you how many times I dismantled my camp to start it just right. For a while it looked like a shoe box. :| Still, it blows my mind the ingenious and evil layouts some players use for trap houses. My friend built a portable toilet that blasts you with radiation when he flips a switch. Stuff like that just makes my eyes @\_@.

This is what I use to find random crap I want.

480 hours...seen him twice and finally popped him today.
---
Personally, I like it. It doesnt have the best rewards, and could definitely be improved, but its still fun in my eyes. The best part for me is the prime cuts events, but I enjoy the meat cook aswell. Of course I think I am one of the few people who play this game that enjoys the gameplay, not just getting rewards/loot.
---
I would like to see cards where rank 3 = 1 perk point, just like rank 1 of a couple = 2 perk points (lone wanderer for one).
---
I would start with lock picking and hacking.  No reason those things take up so much room (3 cards and 3 points each).
---
Either that or have a faster way of equipping and unequipping them.
---
This is...rough. Unless you like it? In that case, yay for you lol.
---
Lol nice one. Didn't even notice that my phone autocorrected it.
---
At this point in the game, a lot of people sell very common plans and recipes for 50 caps or less. Player vending can help you greatly and for a fraction of the cost and grind.
---
I'd love to display my power armour but I have no camp budget to even put a single glowing letter from the signs and letters plan that cost me 9300 caps last night.
---
At this point I don't know what to delete from my camp to make room.
---
I have had that saved for a while. Doing a ctrl-f search, the words "mouth" or "harp" aren't even on the entire page, or the comments...
---
I'd very much like to drop the keys, so many mama dolche manager keys
---
This right here is your fastest and cheapest way to score basic CAMP plans. The XP you get is another plus.
---
Yea, I just noticed that. I know I've found a mouth harp at the Son's of Dane compound but I can't recall if it's a junk item or not.
---
They just want to use your workbenches. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/mCrNc0J.jpg
---
But Graham says
---
 its just like Faschnat, only better. Why?  Because Grahams has more meat....
---
Aw man i feel you. 80% of my camp budget are sheepsquatch plushies. Also where did you get the plans i been looking for ages
---
Explosive helps on ghouls and good for tagging enemies to loot in a group. Crippling perks and weapons are a good melee shotgun tagteam. Great for the raids
---
It's the instrument. I'm asking if the JUNK ITEM exists in-game at all.
---
He needs more rewards.
---
Lose Curator and take a point each out of Tormentor and Four Leaf Clover.
---
But they do.  
---
Unless it changed, there is a 10 pct fee on sales.
---
Well with the cryolator I meant that the notes probably didn‚Äôt make it out of vault 111 since the few staff who did make it out most likely didn‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs existence and or died in a way that the plans would never see the light of day until years later and probably not to Appalachia since the route to West Virginia and Boston is blocked by mountains and the glowing sea. Also I didn‚Äôt say it wasn‚Äôt completely impossible for someone to make a cryo Gun it‚Äôs just that they look the exact same and that it probably requires advanced level knowledge. The geniuses in Appalachia that I think could make a cryolator (Ella, Enclave, BOS, maybe that animal translator guy) are too busy with their own goals in mind during the 25 year period to even consider making a cryo Gun on their off time. Also riot armor funding would‚Äôve been provided by the steel and mining corporations because they have big pockets to spend on covering up a public outcry. Also I should‚Äôve worded it better I meant that they have similar origins in terms of nuke properties and that west coast silos probably would find built in missile factories very useful so they would probably take notes on Appalachia‚Äôs silos and have some sort of supply chain between the two.
---
I‚Äôm literally only using it to get my scrip up for the purveyors sales, item rewards are just straight useless. I wish the loot pool had more in it personally
---
Same thing happened for me. I had gathered around thirty technical data by the time I got to the point in the main quest where you can do this. Assuming it worked like fallout 4 I went and turned it in. Thirty tech data for a couple dozen 45 rounds and a super stim. I logged off for the night after that lol.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
To be fair, it looked like a shoe box like I mentioned above for a while. I had too many turrets which chewed through my budget, sadly. I dropped down to two missile turrets and a regular one, shrunk down the design, and had space for junk! :D (Though, I would like to be able to hoard and add details with junk like in FO4. I need clutter in my game, damn it!)  It doesn't matter if it was in the Sims, FO4, or any other game where you're able to build, I tend to think about real houses and how they're designed. I don't know how beneficial they'd be, but you can find bungalow house plans online to help give an idea of space/layout/design.
---
Thanks!
---
It's cute enough and keeps me going, but it's never been at the same level that Fasnacht was.  It doesn't help that the last Meat Week really wasn't that long ago, so the event isn't as fresh.
---
I Just crashed.
---
Had this happen other day from a SM tossing a molotov on me. My PA was all LotD looking until I got out of it
---
Spooky
---
This cant be upvoted enough. I hate how my game freezes for a second or two every time I switch weapons using the favorites wheel. As a person who likes having a variety of different weapons, its very annoying.
---
Huh didnt know you could build that close to jack
---
They were on the vendor bot at R&amp;G Station, bottom of the Savage Divide.
---
Yeah, my camp boundary actually overlaps with some of the pumpkin shelves! You can get right in there
---
Might switch to my berserk explosive combat shotgun instead of grinding it up just to get less down time and more shots. Using a suppressors explosive double barrel right now
---
Might move next to him then I want to make a cute halloween shed
---
If they put the riot gear/veteran NCR ranger armor into the atom shop I would buy it with no hesitation.
---
And how do you deal with the scorchbeast that spawns?
---
Wish we could have auction houses. Kinda like FFXI back in the day. Not sure how that would work considering you stayed on one dedicated server always on that game. But it could make our economy more realistic. Prices truly determined by market
---
Lol me too

Welcome to pa. Stay off the top of ur fridges on Sundays and no donkeys in the kitchen on Sundays.(real mother fucking laws)

Good for acid. Really thats all.
---
camp location?
---
Frequently and with a lot of frustration because this is on my low level side character lol
---
The problem with vault 111 is the only way out at that time is/was the overseers office via the emergency section. Given that the armoury closet is in his office. I can‚Äôt see them not seeing the gun.  
---
Exact copies is just a game limitation. I always say. Don‚Äôt take game mechanics as true value. Look to art and story. The best example is the laser musket. In game it take cells to fire but lore wise it doesn‚Äôt take anything. It just creates energy to fire. 
---
It also could be that riot armour is just second best to combat armour. 
---
Based on what we read about the Appalachia silos they seem slightly new and expensive. Hopeville  seems like it‚Äôs been there for a long time.  Maybe it was going to receive upgrades but never happened.
---
I actually was thinking the opposite. It seems like this meat week has been very popular. I struggled last time but every time ive done it this week theres been at least four other people.
---
Instead of just fixing TSE shotguns and how they worked, they just totally nerfed all TSE weapons all together
---
Found a quick fix to this bug. Double tap left button on d pad should fix the " incorrect missing ammo" bug.
---
Report back what you find
---
It's been a bug since beta, had the Queen cradh land in Watoga once!

Even when you do!

üòÇ that‚Äôs funny

Archery, swimming, running

It‚Äôs crazy, of all bugs that could happen. It‚Äôs my dead pet Chris, go on and pet him he‚Äôs harmless
---
It's how I got my first scorch beast trophy screenshot at least!
---
There were a few mods for 4 that did this, given how few mechanics changes happened, I can't imagine it should be that hard a QoL issue for them to put on the list that probably exists.
---
Throw in cranberry cobbler or relish to the bonus xp part. Plus 5% and 10% respectively.
---
You can use sort to make things easier.   If you're on PC there are some excellent mods for sorting.
---
Unfortunately there is not Mods on console...yet
---
You can still use sort, it's not great but it helps.
---
The overseer is likely proud you're rebuilding America.
---
Garvey the time traveler
---
Archery, athlete and hunting, imo.
---
Well we are supposed to be rebuilding america. Thats what i want. I want to slowly rebuild america and go from my own camp to my own town with npcs. Ya right lol
---
It has happened to me twice now during primal cuts; the other times may slightly after events   but for whatever reason pacifist is toggling off and I don't understand why. Maybe I should take a video but it is hard because I am not expecting it to happen. It is pretty frustrating. Didn't even play the last few days.
---
Not that Bethesda views new vegas as radioactive but......
---
So I doubt anything will bleed over
---
Bill2million...name looks familiar. I‚Äôm sure we have fought each other in NW before. Clan of Zimox here. On PS4.
---
I like the different gameplay, it's not just shooting bullet sponges every time. I like getting tons of meat from the primal cuts events for my carnivore build too.
---
Well maybe they did see it but they did have to fight off security and were too starving and desperate to care about it. Who knows if hopeville didn‚Äôt have a missile factory there are multiple launchable nukes plus the ones the courier inadvertently set off. Either way the connection between hopeville and big mt and the potential connection between 76 we could possibly see just a few things from hopeville or even a technological wonder from the big empty.
---
I'm PC. But thanks. I'll make a 4th guy focused on shotguns by the time Wastelanders comes out.
---
No, watoga train vendor carried it, the metal one.  600+ caps.
---
I wouldn't mind a player based drop box or locker for your camp that can transfer items. I was hoping for a bank with at least 200lb weight limit. So the real question is would you rather have 200 lbs transfer limit added or 200lbs stash added to each character?
---
Actually I think I‚Äôve seen a note about the Sierra madre but yeah Bethesda hates that obsidian made a better game than they did. Even if adding riot armor in the atom shop would make them buttloads of money.
---
It has been happening since Skyrim.
---
Me and my friend had one visit my camp a few weeks back. We got super panicked because we thought it would teleport away, but we managed to kill it
---
archery, hunter, swimming, athelete, mamalogist are all pretty easy

Hey also beyond our speculation I do think I recall reading a note about some guy in Appalachia going to the Sierra madre‚Äôs grand opening. Wish we could have a Dean Domino reference somewhere.

So you hate if someone say ‚Äúsorry I was on mute, my wife walked in the room?‚Äù That annoys you? Lol

I was playing with my brother yesterday, and everytime he ported on me, there was a govt supply drop appearing where he spawned... lasted for hours
---
Not at all. But given we have the hornwrights and garrahans. Two really rich families I‚Äôd think one of them would have gone.  But also Appalachia didn‚Äôt really get hit too much probably made them stay.
---
That would mean also every level 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 cards separate from each other?
---
Now that‚Äôs just a good idea
---
Nice! Well done maths.
---
Same here. With the high luck from unyielding my crit bar fills very quickly.

It does get old that‚Äôs for sure
---
God it would be nice to come across someone like this. I‚Äôve never come across a decent person on xb1. I have, however, been ripped off.
---
Yeah, I see a deathclaw and I'm not scared. Whereas a single Yao Guai often kills me
---
Oh this is why my shotgun build isn't working. I didn't realize them healing like that was a bug.
---
Fuck that I'm asking for more space. I'm level 30 and already running out
---
I‚Äôve only seen one once, in the Mire. It was at the top of a hill and I landed a single shot with VATS from below before running up as it moved away down the other side of the hill. When I got to the top, nothing. No sign of it. Vanished.

Just nothing exciting to acquire from it.

I dunno, I'd like the ability to move cards to one of the animated versions if I get one in the future.

Never heard of this bug before

Or different stashes have different carry weight. Like a footlocker has less then a desk or file cabinet

Easily solved by having it automatically apply to your existing one! It's an extra star if needed, or just a cosmetic modifier if not needed,

I‚Äôve always wondered where Mothwoman is, since there‚Äôs so many eggs laying around ü§î

yeah, but i was hoping that at some point we would be able to trade in our extra cards for some type of perk script

Thank you

October is Tuesday
---
What platform do you play on? I would love to run through the silo and let you launch the nuke!
---
He doesn‚Äôt use anything from your inventory. 
---
He doesn‚Äôt do a lot of damage. 
---
HOWEVER the biggest benefit IMO is him drawing the enemy away from you momentarily. Can be crucial reload/stim/eat/drink time that you might not have otherwise. Also helps if something is charging at you, he‚Äôll pop in behind it and make it turn around for a moment. 
---
I have it maxed out and always equipped.
---
In the game he is yeah. But in actual West Virginia folk lore he is basically a man with wings and a moth head
---
Yup. Shotguns. Pistols. Explosive\* weapons. The list goes on.
---
\*Rocket launcher, M79, etc.
---
Thanks for the info
---
How do you keep your stash low
---
New one to me.  It's nice to have a unique bug all to yourself :)
---
Holy shit! It's Joshua Graham!
---
Yeah. Basically everything other than half the heavy weapons, automatic weapons, and rifles. And even then auto weapons could use a buff in condition
---
Limiting your junk components is the key. Cloth, wood, and leather build up so quick!
---
man i live in a metal box with turrets
---
This. Some people choose swimming but that requires someone to collaborate. These are doable while solo.
---
Considering spam crafting was a cause of server instability, and Beth changed it to include a one second delay per craft to help alleviate. I‚Äôm surprised they didn‚Äôt include a craft ‚Äúnumber‚Äù bar or input ‚Äúnumber‚Äù at that point to get rid of the need to spam. Cause it would certainly be helpful and used by all
---
It was good the first time because of the double exp. 
---
This time? boring. I've ended up soloing the cookout and prime events on full servers because no one cares anymore.
---
They didn't even provide plans for the tenderizer or the fireworks mine. It was really lazy to me.
---
I saw one like this today by Slocum Joe's, it was the nuka cola girl.
---
A Tesla rifle I suggest.
---
I could never live there. Nobody tells my donkey want to do.
---
Fear not unbeliever. 
---
When you perish, your soul will return to the dust of his great wings, from which we were all beat forth into existence, guided by his brilliance, like a moth to the eternal flame.
---
Same here I am a 127 on XB1 hit me up if you want to do it
---
Adhesive and gold from the honey beasts too.
---
Seen a few of these recently.   Were you stealthy by any chance?  And how did it take the card? Wouldn't you have only put that in when ready to tap in the code?  Not saying you did anything wrong, just trying to understand what happened so i can think how to avoid it.  Also what platform?  Bound to be people who will help on any platform.
---
Ive fought many also sinci i posted this have battled in other gouls in arktos
---
My first viable legendary was a 2 shot pump. It was the first weapon I had that actually felt pretty powerful. I'm still salty they turned it to shit, and I still carry it out of spite.
---
Depends really I have had as little as 4 people including myself. Other times I have seen more then enough to man all stations and hunt critters.
---
Is that why you've been MIA because you've been exploring The Pitt? üòÇ
---
This all day. There will never be enough stash space. I really miss organizing items based off my own system from Fallout 4. I understand why the limitations are implemented but someday....
---
I have heard others complain about it although you're right, it doesn't seem that common.
---
Freezing while using aid items from the pipboy is an old bug. It's infrequent so easy for the devs to ignore.
---
Normally, people would just move on if they hate a game so much.  Why care about it so much when you yourself say it's not worth playing?
---
Screenshot of the map?
---
My tv literally has a zoom function.  If yours does, turn it off.  A bit Captain Obvious i know :)
---
In the kitchen, smh
---
I play on PC.
---
That would be so Awesom I hope your playing on PS4 I will be on some time tomorrow I will look you up. My IGN is ZombieRangler
---
perish\*
---
brought\*
---
Is the exit point in a particular place, or is just the whole area north of V51 open?  I'd like to check it out for myself.
---
Yeah, I guess if another player is in the 3-step process (enter key card, enter code, enter location), it will still take the key card. It isn't until after the nuke is launched that it will reject anything further.
---
Well with the long delay between public events at least it gives me something to do xD
---
Just happened to me again today. Seem to get it about once every other day. It's been happening since I've had the game, almost a year ago. I assume it doesn't get publicized as much as other problems because it's configuration dependent. It is frustrating.
---
Well shit man Idk what to tell you, he picked my lock, hit me and destroyed my camp. I dont know if my turrets shit him which made him my enemy or not but that's how it went down lol I'm not a PVP player in the slightest im a store owner/ wandering trader and he was my first real griefer so I'm not sure how it all works. If one of my team mates shot him would that change anything?
---
Partly because I've been playing these games since the very beginning, partly because Bethesda used to be my favorite developer.
---
They could make amazing games they chose not to.
---
More profitable to churn out garbage and rake in the merchandise $$$.
---
I mean I barely play the game anymore, I have peak gear, hundreds of hours spent waiting for content. 
---
I log in for the atoms then I go play better games.
---
Alternatively, use a blueprint of the objects you want to build. The game seems to accept those, for reasons that are lost on me.
---
The PC player base is like a quarter the size of console. Just check market.76 it's like 1 pc listing for every 30 console. There is no exact numbers but it's not that hard to tell. I still play on PC though. I personally enjoy it more an it's not completely dead.
---
Yeah I ended up doing the same thing eventually, had to rewire my whole camp lol worth it though
---
yes
---
Thanks for the feedback. Yeah, I'll probably add purified water to my favorites wheel and do it that way.
---
Awh man sorry! Best of luck though! The fallout community is awesome. I hope someone helps you speed run it to get it done!
---
Some people like CAMPS an are just walking around to check it out. I always walk around before checking vendors.
---
It was weird though because he tried breaking my walls and nothing would happen and then he picked my lock, gave me the thumbs down and killed me lol no idea
---
Let me store my junk and I‚Äôll be there for free.
---
Yeah, my phone auto corrects perish. 
---
I did however mean beat. As in wing beat. We come from the dust of his wings. Delivered by wing beat.
---
Anything can just bring forth stuff. Only the moth can beat forth souls.
---
Nice theres a guy I see all the time on PC with an almost identical build.
---
I‚Äôm the same. Level 45 and I always around 700 stash and I have to use power armour in order to hold the rest. More stash space would be great.
---
I rarely fast travel and I think that's the key. I have met him maybe 50 times since release. Killed him twenty, maybe more. Sometimes I just take a picture and keep going.
---
And let us be able to display Nuka Cola in the cola machine. The door opens but it does nothing and it just seems like a waste
---
Also not bad if you run with a ‚Äúhalf-dead‚Äù build and the Revenant perk. Pretty nice for getting myself killed deliberately so the Stranger can give me a 50% damage boost for 2 minutes.
---
Oh, hell yeah! Couldn't agree more! Definitely! Umm... wait? *What the fuck?* Okay, you lost me, 100% over my head now, I guess.
---
If you are on a team with the person all team members get the quest. I know this is mostly useless and the damage is done but if you ever find yourself in this situation again maybe send a quick group invite? And hope they accept it? ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Make sure you smelt ore on chem table and bulk junk on tinker station. I couldn‚Äôt believe how much that changed things. Also go through your junk, get rid of stuff you never use - you can sell bulk junk at vendor for decent prices or at your vending machine.  I also Scrip or sell legendaries I will never use. When my stash is full I don‚Äôt want to wait for buyers, I just scrip them. Any gun or armor that is not legendary, scrap or sell at a vendor, no one ever buys them at your vending machine. Drop all ammo you never use, especially middles and nukes - they are so overweight. I also throw out or use up under half used fusion cores. Sell any chems you never use - vendors buy for okay prices but honestly people never buy chems unless they‚Äôre low priced or stimpaks. Hope this helps!
---
Create a new character with a completely different build. The map has changed a bit, and you can focus on a specific build: a high int scientist who uses only high-tech weapons. Or a brute 2h melee with a baseball bat and explosives. Keeps the game fresh for me.
---
Is there any way to get rid of the power armor chassis? Cause I have like 15 of them.
---
Between the previous one and this one, I think I got them all, including plans. But I wasnt trying: it was just luck.
---
Right I'm level 39 and every time I go any where i have to go get rid of  either scrap, store or sell it.
---
Yeah.... i saw that as i posted.... my fail
---
Unfortunately, the majority of my camps are built around in-game content... like underground secret hideaways, monorail cars, empty big houses, storefronts, gas stations, etc. I've also visited some really fun ones where people are somehow exploiting the bugs to build their camps entirely underwater and in a below-game world where you teleport into them somehow...   
---
And it can often take many hours to do those cuz the build system is more than a bit buggy. :/ So I definitely wouldn't be down to destroy my camps on a regular basis in order to participate...   
---
Here's a few random examples of some camps I liked recently &amp; doubt the creators would want to quickly vanish...

It's a sad day when a Mutated sheep can destroy a creature that was made by the U.S military to literally be death on legs lol 
---
Can anyone else remember that jolt of fear that shot through your whole body when you rounded a corner and saw a deathclaw in FO3 and FNV? Haven't had that since
---
It‚Äôs total acquired I believe and not held
---
Yes. You can drop them the same way you do anything else. Just dont place as if your getting in.
---
Same here. It's been stuck on the final step for three days and hasn't completed for me.
---
Sorry been a bit busy. Added you now. I'm SH00T3R619
---
Good news... he shows up during primal cuts events
---
Oh ok that makes more sense thanks
---
It works fine, leave it alone. Watch the time better. The cookout starts every hour on the hour.
---
Hacking terminals also seemed to get more tedious, if anything
---
I got an unexpected anti-armor faster fire +1 perception lever action rifle from the prime sheepsquach near Welch. Too bad that character Is a pure melee unarmed ninja.
---
Came to say this.
---
I find it very meat-iocre. But at least I can find Grahm.
---
Okay, but only if they can walk like in Skyrim.
---
If it moves, shoot it. If it doesn't, shoot it until it does.
---
Pumpkin grenades
---
Hackers are bringing themselves back to life
---
Those masks are so rare that it is debatable they dont exist
---
it would be easier to take off their armor and eat a grenade in the stream behind flatwoods..
---
He sometimes shows up during the Mire Prime Meat event.  Yesterday he took over the Prime Mirelurk Queen and both the glowing gulpers that spawn with her on the 4th wave.
---
The one from the atom shop does
---
Those are super rare on every system, good luck.
---
That really bothers me too. I always have to check the time on my pipboy to know if it's night.
---
Part moth part owl
---
Once again. Silos need to lock out other players if your solo running or team running.
---
^ THIS! NEED! NOW!
---
Each box could hold 200 pounds
---
Bethesda "We heard you wanted us to buff the creatures so we did so now all enemies have 10x the health and 1 out of 2 bullets have no effect just to give more reason to farm lead and steel"

This post is old but worth a read for someone in your position. Hope it helps:

So many fallout 4 aspects missing....
---
If you want PC just download the mod for it, if not I wouldn't hold my breath as you probably seen inside the vault and with stuff they listed I expect late them to be partially done by late Q1 2020.
---
Ok thank you
---
What u use adhesive and gold for? I always seem to be dropping them. Also im super intrested in wastelanders where it looks like the dudes pan handling for gold.
---
like a red cross armband, but for responders.  
---
there's a lot of really cool ideas to unpack here.  especially making certain locations into true war zones (eg workshops).  additionally, giving pve players the choice of engaging rather than forcing pvp is certainly appreciated.
---
itd be nice also if we could form our own gangs/groups instead of just generic raider v settler.
---
finally, in eso if your faction captures a certain number of keeps, and/or scrolls you get like nice little stat buffs which might create incentive for faction warfare
---
Must be nice, out of 3 out of 4 runs for Primal this event the legendary enemy disappeared before looting to the point I will skip this event.
---
Kill and collect and scrap as much as you can in uranium fever. You can also go inside the level 30+ area at Charleston Capitol building to grind xp (+legendaries). Make sure you server hop
---
Yes they do.
---
What stage of the silo were you in?  We're you sneaking?  There is no way of knowing if someone is in the silo. Did you see the person run past you?
---
Begging for attention / lying. There were 2 people on the server pre-prepping silos for launch. a 316 and a 354. I have their player names if you wanna PM me to confirm.
---
Basically the 316 launched first, and the silo was already prepped for the 354 to just walk in and launch. Basically you wasted your time picking a silo someone had prepped already.  
---
They saw you on map but did not see you in the silo, or they would have spoken to you.
---
Sorry, but it sucks to be you. Look at the map more next time? If you saw him in the silo before a launch you just participated in, best to not go into it and pick another silo / server.
---
Are you sure that you've passed the fence that marks the map's boundary?
---
I've scouted out all around there. Totally going to try again.
---
Waiting up here in Amish country. If ya make it this far, we‚Äôll crack a cold one together.
---
Be happy to speed-run you through a silo in compensation for this, too. I can get you through a silo in about 15 mins. Just PM me anytime on Reddit and set a time, or wave me down and in-world chat me if I'm online in world. Same name as my Reddit. I'd be happy to run you through however many times you'd like. Willing to provide nuclear keycards too.
---
Nah. Not a fan of lockouts. Look for a less populous server next time?
---
Not gonna lie, I read the title like "De plane boss, De plane!"
---
It's never bad when you get to participate with other people. I like seeing twelve other players with their outfits and weapons and styles.
---
I‚Äôm not OP. Never have had a silo/nuke stolen. I‚Äôm looking out for others. 
---
And no silo sniping shouldn‚Äôt even be a thing. If your (no you expressly) are too lazy or that desperate to take someone‚Äôs thunder then forcing others out of the silo is needed. 
---
If your going to solo it then no one should be allowed in. Help or not. You want to help then you should request to join the person in the silo first. Same thing as a team.
---
Geez, that's a gloomy attitude.  Are you playing on a console?
---
&gt;Pew Pew 
---
&gt; Swag
---
Best vendor camp ever
---
This may have been me.  Our team periodically preps two silos at once (one person in each silo) and do two back to back nukes.  My teammate nuked first from Alpha, we killed the queen, then I went back to the Bravo silo that was at already at completion.  
---
I had mentioned to my teammate on Discord "hey I thought I saw someone in Bravo" but then when both of us looked again on the map, no one else showed up, so I asked in [Area] if anyone was here, and upon not hearing a response, I went through with the launch.
---
My sincerest apologies if I took the silo from you, it definitely wasn't intentional, and if you have time look us up and we will definitely help (or stay out of your way) with another silo run.
---
**
---
EDIT: Given all the details given throughout the thread (active interaction between the two parties from mainframe room all the way through to launch prep room, wrong time when this happened), this definitely wasn't me.  But, our offers still stand for nuke assistance if you're interested!
---
OK, so now you can have people just "hold" silos and lock them for friends? No, NOT a good idea.
---
Its a decent intention you have, but its a horrible idea if executed on. People can just "camp" silos all freaking day if they feel like it and even hold them hostage. Think of how people can maliciously use this feature, if implemented, plz.
---
Ask your buddies to see if they know any dupers, they have a boatload of those.
---
NO NO SHHHHH! SHHHHH! YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO LEAK THE PITT DLC YET!
---
I have experience with the CK and modding fallout. Fixing this stuff and reworking snap points would take me an afternoon at most, they just don't care about "fixing" stuff like that  because it's not broken, just badly designed.
---
I didn't think of that
---
Water and sleep probably. You shouldn't stare at a TV for 40 straight hours.
---
The first step is admitting you have a problem....
---
So I've heard I've only seen the jester mask but I didn't realize it was rare at the time
---
Can you craft one for me i will give you the mini psn:yopipz28
---
No that wouldn‚Äôt bother me but if you brag about your SO playing a game and it‚Äôs the topic of conversation every single time I talk to you then I‚Äôd just rather not talk to you.
---
Obviously be proud of the relationship but a stranger usually won‚Äôt care about it unless your actively playing a game together.
---
They should at the very least bring back single foundation stairs and upper floor snapping to walls, not just stairs, The amount of brain hurting nonsense you have to go trough if you want to move your stairs after placing floors is insane.
---
&gt;I have to push myself to crazy limits, in order to play as much as I can of them. Because it's a once in a lifetime thing and I'll never be able to experience the gameplay experience again.
---
Except it really isn't.  This isn't the first Meat Week and it certainly won't be the last.
---
What you are doing is fundamentally unhealthy and your body is rebelling against it.  You have a problem.
---
Three silos and all three are being held ransom? Unlikely but could happen. 
---
Also it‚Äôs just an idea. The odds BGSA actually add this feature is highly not in our favor.  Also it‚Äôs just a basis for an idea. The devs can hash out the finer details. I ain‚Äôt gettin paid for that part.
---
This happens in Skyrim with dragons too, I‚Äôve found that moving a considerable distance away stops them from following you
---
Uhm just so you know It‚Äôs coming back.
---
swwwwwweeeeeet caroline...EAT SHIT PITT
---
What happens if you reject the mission? Will it pop up again later? Mine is stuck on the final step too.
---
I don‚Äôt that happen to me in Skyrim but it‚Äôs been a while, I ran through it soooo many times. Bethesda likes to keep it simple lol
---
are you over 21 and do you live in canada or in a US state where weed is legal?
---
He needs his boss not to notice he‚Äôs gaming binged out, so you suggest weed?  
---
His boss will love that.
---
The Statue you can place in your CAMP is definitely more in line with the lore because it's based on the real statue in West Virginia.
---
Hell yeah üëçüèªüéÉ
---
if you still need one ,my psn is KfcKuzenbo
---
It actually gets easier once youre higher level. You start to realize what type and how much of each junk you need to keep. At low levels I always just pick up everything so that I always have stuff for building camps and crafting/repairing my gear. 
---
I have 2 characters now that are level 90 and level 240. I only keep 50 of each junk, with the exception of lead and acid. (For making ammo). I only keep weapons and armor that im selling in machines. The heaviest items now is the mass amounts of ultracite ammo ive created for each of them.  
---
Eventually you just get used to what you need. And if you are short on something like steel, you learn how and where to get it when you need it, so you dont have to hoard it in your stash. The hardest part is coming from fallout 4 where you were able to hoard infinite amounts in your settlements. And then realizing that doesnt work in 76.
---
I was the other person the one whom launched from Alpha.  I launched and we killed the queen in less than 5 minutes  and my buddy went back to bravo to launch the silo he had already prepared. He said that he thought someone was in the silo when he fast traveled to the silo. I then looked at the map and saw no one there. Many times we see people go into the silos to grab the lead so we figured that it was clear. He ran through the shortcuts and launched. You should have found all of the doors open for you as he had done launch prep and left the silo. 
---
PM me and I will give you a few cards and or help you through the process. We do as many as nine nukes per day so we have some methods to make the silo faster.
---
Yeah, but he's a really cute moth
---
Yeah this is probably the #1 thing to do for about 80% of ailments.   Sleep water.  .  Which i am about to do now.
---
Beat forth into existence can be a very different kind of beating if you know what I mean
---
2 silos on rebuild from launch, and someone camps a 3rd one and demands compensation so he can quit and you can finish a 3rd?  
---
 Viable.
---
What is your gamer tag on xbox? I can give you a bunch. I was giving plans to lower level people all day.
---
Meat Week Primal Meat events right now are great experience.
---
Also groups can team up and "camp" all silos on a map also.  
---
Viable.
---
Thats relative.  I missed the last meat week in its entirety - that they brought it back was good IMHO.
---
Couple of camp items, couple outfits, tenderizer to play with ... I won‚Äôt complain.
---
Same. I love seeing how creative people get with their builds, especially when vending areas tend to be the most simple compared to the rest of the structure.
---
Didn‚Äôt say it couldn‚Äôt be done. I said it was unlikely.
---
So long and thanks for all the fish üëã
---
At least the community managers know.  u/Ladydevann told me the devs would be notified.  So hopefully they can fix this.  In the mean time, at least on PC I found that using hot keys directly is a short term fix.
---
I'm (self censored) sorry, but I've run into enough goddamned entitled griefing "this is MY server!" jerks to not only say it possible, but friggin likely.
---
Enough meat cleavers to build a tower of meat cleavers. And tato salad.
---
So you think if Bethesda allows people to "lock" silos by starting them, NOBODY will MISUSE that feature and PURPOSEFULLY lock silos so other people can't use them, RIGHT?!?!   
---
And you think what \*I\* said is ridiculous? What a crock.
---
Yeah griefers suck ass! Dicks like that need banned! And you can tell who they are because the always try and put logical reasoning behind their Bullshit. Just remember Karmas a bitch and she hates griefers too!
---
I refer to my farewell.
---
I love Grahm and getting to hear more from him but that's about it. Not a fan of this event or its rewards.
---
How many caps would you pay for one?
---
What do you mean by metabolism boosting foods? First google results that pop up are saying eggs, lentils and chilis?
---
lol kk, I'ma finish this silo run I'm doing :D
---
HERESY. 
---
You will smoke a turd in hell for this, unbeliever!
---
I guess it pops up after the dailies reset? How do you reject a mission?
---
Yeah xbox.
---
I have trouble getting caps and I probably wouldn't be able to offer much I only have 200 cap right now
---
I get downvoted for providing perspective and mentioning how features can be misused. LOL This board is stupid.
---
Oh my god, they killed Kenny!
---
Did you just start playing?
---
Hey, thank you for your assistance - it's nice to be heard.
---
Wtf
---
As a super casual player who has not had much time to get on lately it's a fine event for me, easy scrip to store up and waste once the vendor sale happens, but for the more active players I imagine it would be a bit stale.
---
I guess from this PERSPECTIVE, the OP was trying to steal a silo they had already pre-prepped (went through all steps including launch prep). So it could also be seen as the OP trying to steal the other person's silo run as well?
---
Repost
---
They should add it for Tea Time too! I can never beat it!!
---
Ok. I have an anti armor faster fire rate combat shotgun that is... Fucking absurd.
---
And 2 or 3 different kinds with explosive and other settings I dont remember. 
---
I think I also have a quad ammo double barrel.
---
I'm trying to run a stealth commando build...
---
I have one in my vendor I can pop on and sell it to you for 60 caps if you want.  I had it in for 100 caps but i can lower it a bit so you arent depleated caps.
---
I was always wondering how does instigating effect works with shotguns. Does only one pellet get bonus damage or all of them?
---
Bloodied shotguns are still good I can get my non explosive bloodied combat shotgun to do 600 damage without adrenaline. Used to have a bloodied explosive double barrel shotgun that did 1.2k damage but sold it for a VE harpoon gun because super mutants at west tek kept on killing me because of the low health
---
that's a neat idea!  to expand, maybe also cooking different items for a "bake sale"
---
I'll buy it for 100 it's no big deal my psn is DrearyScientist-
---
Ok give a moment ill log in and send you a fr for it.
---
The best part of meat week is the meat sweats. 
---
I just wished it lasted longer. I want to fart all day long.
---
I dont know lol.but it should be a insta kill with almost everything
---
Ok
---
The first thing you need to do is probably call in sick if you haven‚Äôt slept in two days. The second is never do this again. Every single thing from meat week can be had with caps.
---
Encryptid as well, please.
---
I‚Äôm on not doing much add me:  rdean1209
---
No I just started playing again recently
---
Yeah from now on i will do the same, even if like you i will be overencumbered lol Thanks for the tip!
---
How is it everyone isn't aware of the raid effect on the world yet?
---
The raid causes every event to become stronger
---
Yeah sure, my PSN is HillbillyDLUX08
---
For sure! Some people do it maliciously, and others just don't check their camps before logging off. Best to be safe, and to also check your camp (even if it isn't floating) to see if someone is there. :)
---
The second shot is grossly inaccurate on semi auto from what I hear. So if you are sniping with it, may not be horrible beneficial.
---
Hey I sent you fr and am in game.
---
The OP would not of got the I Am Become Death quest completion since the quest completes once Launch Prep is complete.  Both my self and Kurios have offered to make the OP whole since it was not done to greve or be malicious. We were doing what we do, When Kurios thought that someone could be in the silo he tried to call out on area with no response so he launched. 
---
We have helped many people through the silo and are willing to help the OP through as well.
---
You need to sleep and drink water. It was a stupid thing to do.
---
Go Berserk
---
I think what your saying is great, almost exactly what I want. But I think if you REALLY want people to participate the faction your in is based off of the faction that you fight for the most in adventure mode. When you earn better reputation in that faction they'll ask you to join the war and help with either PvP or quests. That'll get people more interested. As if it genuinely affects the story, they'll want to play it.

üòÜ
---
I'm at my camp now if you want me too.
---
Sure accept my friend request so u can join me
---
Just accepted, sorry I didn't realize you had sent it
---
What's your psn I didn't get a friend request
---
What's your psn I didn't get a friend  request
---
In your pipboy under daily missions I have an option to reject it. I'm on Xbox so the button is x
---
You don't have to suggest they put something in the Atom shop, if it's a good enough idea it'll be there (i.e. the fridge).
---
Its fine happens a lot of time im joining so wait
---
Usually I will watch if a someone is in a Silo and if they are taking longer than 20 minutes assume it's their first time and need some help.  I'll jump in, catch up, and invite them to group.  That way if I do need to launch for them or they don't have a mic for me to explain they still get credit.
---
Figure it never hurts to have a veteran show ya the ropes those Silos can be a confusing maze!
---
If you are on PC willing to lend a hand!
---
Some griefers were messing with my friends and I and this glitch happened to me. They couldn't kill me but I could still kill them so they bailed and threatened to report me.
---
Well Bethesda hates new Vegas recognition and would probably only add riot armor in due to mass suggestion.
---
I'm maining B25 .50 Cal as well and with Exterminator+Glow Sight combo these bastards don't live very long. IMO, both are must-have for heavy gunners (Since perception slots aren't filled with rifle perks).
---
Poison is a bitch though, need to pop two stimpaks simultaneously to regen faster than it eats through my already low health.
---
No, and no
---
I suspect that this person doesn't know that. If it was their first launch they certainly have never encountered a prep'd Silo nor do they know why it would be different.
---
I probably wouldn't called them a liar, that's why your getting the down votes.
---
Man I'm so sorry. I thought I modded it myself. But it seems as though I didnt. I'll find someone to do it and pay for it.
---
Not sneaking, actively doing the silo and was about 50% before they showed up. They ran past me numerous times. Couldn't have missed me.
---
There was an alarm clock released through the atom shop for free a while ago. Doesn‚Äôt look like any of those though
---
Just promise us you‚Äôll come back and tell us where you woke up after you inevitably crash out on the train ride to work.
---
I think the better question fam is...  how the fuck did he play that crappy event for 40 hours straight  üòÇüòÇüòÇ dead
---
What is your psn
---
Scrap cards for reroll
---
My friend is gonna do it.
---
No one was there. I had to go through all the steps. My first time ever being there. I had to get the biometric thing, unlock the doors, destroy the mainframe, etc. etc. I was fighting a ton of robots, so I really don't think this was cleared prior to me getting there.
---
The other person didn't show up until it was at the "rebuild the mainframe" part and I was trying to figure out what to do while fighting stuff.
---
How would you have their names?
---
The person ran around me numerous times and I saw the mic icon but nothing was ever said. It was just normal noise they were making while playing. I didn't have a mic, so couldn't call out to them.
---
I'm not participating in any events, I was solely trying to get the main storyline done after sitting on it for months.
---
There should be options for I guess auto sizing on the tv. That should fix it to some extent.
---
The part I'm saying he's lying about is that he accused my friends of purposefully stealing his silo run. (and suggested they were griefing)
---
I gave my perspective that they were just doing their usual 2-queen run with a pre-prepped silo, tehre was no malicious intent there, that intent is purely in the imagination of the OP, thanks.
---
It just blinks 12
---
Seriously, why would griefers offer advice and compensation? They are literally elsewhere in this thread explaining themselves.
---
What was his name again
---
I'll give that a shot tomorrow.
---
I have the opposite of this picture, me standing on a platform in the exact same location, but I‚Äôm wearing a gold outfit and am frozen from a game bug;) hahahah!
---
Can u mod my mini for me im gonna give a legend
---
MR_DEATH_3000
---
He said he would do it for 100 caps. I'll pay
---
I have a couple clips of him on my xbox , i saw him 3 times on one server like a month ago lmfao
---
Because they saw you briefly on their map when they finished the silo, looked for you on their path, didn't see you, and then proceeded to finish their run. 
---
"It was that fast" because they had already completed the final portion (Launch Prep at command center) so all they had to do was walk in using some doors they previously opened, and launch. 
---
I have their screenames because I game with them every day. I would have been there too, but I was off at a lunch when this happened. I literally got on the server after this happened.
---
Ok 100 seems fair
---
You cant damage someones base unless your hostile to that player or someone on they're team. So unless your teams in pvp with other players your good.
---
Three bored high level mutants can do some seeeerious damage. I saw them destroy someones camp from my shadowed Stealth position.
---
None of the other clocks actually tell the time either though. But yeah it‚Äôs not the best looking
---
I'm joining him to, so I can pay
---
I'm really sorry
---
I think this may be someone else. It was only 1 person in there and s/he saw me numerous times. I think even shot at me once. We were literally standing by each other at the end while I was waiting to do the keycard/keycode thing.
---
OK, so maybe this wasn't me.  I definitely would've seen you if I ran past you (especially multiple times).
---
Can you verify if this was Bravo at about 4:15 pm Pacific today?  Or some other location/some other time?  Was this person wearing the ridiculous giant Vault Girl head?
---
Regardless, see my my other post.  My offer(s) still stand if you want someone to run a silo with.
---
Thanks! I really appreciate that.
---
my gamertag AnonCanadian415, message me here when you added me?
---
I'm at his camp waiting for you
---
So you were at 50% of launch prep? Or were you in the reactor room?  Was there a a nuke launched less than 10 minutes prior on the same server?
---
Are you on now?
---
No, this was at like 6:30pm PDT.
---
See I‚Äôve seen him like 4 or 5 times, but I‚Äôve never seen the Mothman....
---
I thought I had this mod but I don't have that...
---
I'm sorry but this sounds more boring than trying to reach level 50 by killing only squirles and fireflys
---
6:30pm PDT happens when this comment is 21 hours and 46 minutes old.

Hey... It's meat week and we have to beat the meat. Hacking and whacking, like Pete the butcher.
---
Let's face facts, behemoths are just big super mutants.
---
Okay good to know thank you......yeah I‚Äôm solo and don‚Äôt do workshops.  I guess some scorch beast got me and got bored and left.  Ugh
---
My favorite reply of the day - have an up-vote amigo :)
---
No, I was like 50% through the mission/event. I was trying to figure out how to fix the mainframe when they showed up and they completed that step. We both ended up in the last room together standing in there. I was fighting off things from the workers and when it ended, went over to do the stuff and the person was already basically done launching.
---
My low level ass has been enjoying the guaranteed stream of decent XP
---
yeah i‚Äôll hop on
---
Are you on PC ? If you are and decided you want to keep playing let me know. I would be willing to help you run the silo. I cant stop someone from stealing it unless they have pacifist off but maybe we could get it done fast enough that you'll stand a better chance of not having it stolen. the launch is all yours ill just tag along for the ride and help keep the robots of your ass. Only thing i would want in return is some 5mm ammo and maybe some stimpaks or blood packs  if you have any to spare but that‚Äôs optional.ill happily do it for free Because at this point i was starting to get bored with the late game and helping other players has reignited my love for the game. i currently roleplay a level 75 enclave elite trooper. fully customized X-01 power armor with a two shot explosive  gattling gun and a plasma heavy gun. 
---
Also anyone know if their is a roleplaying group i could join that is all about helping other players? Helping low levels around the map or putting the fear into raiders does not matter to me.i am ready for anything
---
Actually......if you‚Äôre serious about being you know relevant and doing damage it is.  If you‚Äôre running around with crafting perks where you can have something g for damage or resist or weight loss then you need to delete the game.
---
Bro I'm not doctor but I'm pretty sure you had a stroke. Can you go to the doctor please.
---
Ya unfortunately theres no alert of those
---
Just added you
---
Happy Halloween fallout people, and for the record "horror music composer" is up there as far as great job titles go. Hope you stay busy this season
---
The level and situation kinda matches, but the details don't. 
---
Regardless if that was them or not, the offer stands to get you through the silo, for plot or for quest or however you wanna do it, anytime I am online.
---
whats your gt i missed it
---
Emerald Kingdom
---
Ugh yes!  I thought they would do it like they did for Skyrim I organized everything that way drives me bonkers lol
---
Idk how it is for eb games but for gamestop I'm only aware of the $5 preorder deposit.
---
This! With this being the second time it's up, and them saying we can earn it again, this guy just seems really dramatic and uninformed.
---
He's really cool.
---
+karma
---
Little bit of everything. Weapon/armor mods. Always running out of gold adding deep pockets to armor.
---
If your in PvP with someone or someone on your team is then its fair game with that person or anyone on their team
---
added you
---
In 3, NV, and 4, I used different containers for different things, and now it's all in one so yeah, I definitely wish we had separate stashes. oh, and I've never tried to drop duplicate keys so I didn't realise that you couldn't. Bummer.
---
Man this guy still drinks monster, please do t let this guy go get hooked on stupid ass vitamin gummies
---
I had three attacking my camp yesterday as I was walking up.  Only thing they managed to destroy, was my front door, and of course knock out four of my turrets.
---
I‚Äôm still baffled that Gunpowder is in the MISC tab. It‚Äôs Junk, Beth. Junk.
---
Dick
---
You need sleep. And to recocgnize thats not healthy! Lol i barfed after 12 hours a few weeks ago. Gotta tone it down a little bit. Its fun but still only a game
---
lol server hopping should never be a gameplay mechanic
---
What would you say if I know of some spawn points for the fasnacht man/solider/ witch masks
---
Unless you find a way for low level players to actually survive and not die to the point of rage quitting, it's not going to be a viable upgrade.  I get a lot of players are high level, but a game can't survive without a constant influx of new people.
---
Just add a time limit before it unlocks again
---
TBH should just be instanced
---
I'd  ask where and say thanks for the information
---
Yeah theres no way someone's has a sun mask or old man mask selling for 60c. Even said it was in his vendor for a while an nobody bought it..
---
I would love a Service Rifle in .308, and an Anti- Material Rifle. Also let us reload ammo to suit our needs.
---
I would certainly support the PVE mentioned by the OP 100%., The closer I get to End Game, the more I want to do different things.
---
I've had it happen when I haven't even killed an SB on that server lol
---
Is there some reason to section off your bed etc? There‚Äôs never so many people about that I can‚Äôt get to what I need. But I keep seeing CAMPs with vendors outside and locked doors to get inside.
---
..I don‚Äôt want to wreck anyone‚Äôs stuff, just see the neat CAMPs!
---
They mentioned it in the last into the vault, but given their track record, I wouldn't hold your breath over seeing them implement it anytime soon.
---
Maybe you should play less. And go outside. Drink some water.
---
Violet isnt common in WS. Only sources i believe are the snaptail reeds by the stream and theres barely enough for 1 stable flux.
---
archery1 /athlete2 /swimming 3/hunting3  also with the events going on right now for meat week prime cuts is a great way to help get a revive in water at savage divide or forest sometimes people go down it's how I finally finished mine lol
---
Where would be the best place to get all of it ... beings all of mine just went out
---
They could make a pair of items that would work to link your camp vending machines to an online network. One adds your items to the network and the other is a dedicated terminal to shop other players items. They could build it on top of the existing vendor system and it would save you the trouble of physically going to other camps.
---
A genuinely nice guy with no hate boner like everyone else. All he cares about is lore, gives to the community, and has no ego.
---
Monster is probably the worst thing, your already crashed, pumping yourself with caffeine and synthetic bull testosterone is not gonna help. 
---
If your healthy and in good shape your body should be able to handle it, but this kind of shit is terrible for your heart. I guarantee you cant focus your eyes very well, theyve been at one focal distance for days. You havent eaten so your probably super dehydrated, and in full on ketosis. 
---
Plus the no sleep fucks your head up too. 
---
I mean ive done this before(not for nearly as long) and I've found that anything over 10 hours makes my eyes hurt and I start feeling sick from being sedentary. But even when ive done that, I was eating/drinking and taking occasional breaks. To stretch my eyes and legs and walk around a bit. 40+ hours is some next level shit and honestly youd be better off going to a hospital than work. 
---
There was a Korean kid who died from playing wow for 48 hours straight, he had a heart attack if I remember correctly.
---
I'm not a doctor, but this seems kinda self destructive, and you might have some addiction problems. 
---
This is coming from someone who definately has an addiction to video games.
---
Wow, Damn, sorry to hear.
---
any reason you want TSE, I mean, they're not as strong as they once were.
---
Look into lucky hole mine.
---
I was wondering if that worked
---
South is the lucky hole mine loaded with lead ore. Wear excavator power armor while collecting the lead ore. Craft lead ore with acid to make lead.
---
My ultamate goal is just running a badass and helpful shop/ bar out of my camp. I'll hop on and farm for legendaries, cool outfits, and any plans I can find with a buddy or two. Then weel play some NW and call it quits. It's a pretty good time. But on ps4 the game has been and probably always will be super laggy and will drop frames often. But if you can look past that this games a gem
---
...And the map in the enclave bunker for fissure sites
---
I've found the soldier and with one's in a costume shop south of the munitions factory near the red rocket mega stop and the man mask in fort defiance, right wing second floor I think. Definitely fort defiance for the man
---
More damage than Aa and probably your best option before going bloodied imo
---
Edit: if your using guns that is
---
guess looking for endgame gear and not having any luck with drops. How badly were they nerfed?
---
Thankfully, I'm on xbox lol
---
not everyone has a pc
---
I know of the mine, would like to set up a base and ore extractor on a deposit though. :)
---
Legendary idea, love it. We need mannequins anyways.
---
Oh okay haha there are a fair amount. There‚Äôs a fallout 76 interactive map aswell if you haven‚Äôt seen it. I just google it to find it every time lol
---
I know of the mine, I'd like to set up a base and ore extractor on a deposit though. :)
---
agreed and happy cake day
---
There are loads of lead deposits in the wild. There is even a map somewhere of all of them.
---
On my way there as we speak
---
Thanks! Kinda forgot it's my cake day haha
---
So you don't care if for its a level 1 TSE pipe pistol???
---
Interesting.....please let me know the results.
---
My CAMP rarely gets anything big and I have all heavy type turrets.
---
Odd though it‚Äôs under a bridge and the wall things and beds were gone from the inside.
---
Isnt the Vox syringer a quest-weapon ? Not sure those are supposed to be sellable.
---
Perks ruin pvp.
---
Not found many, have checked some resource maps and most Lead deposits were connected to workshops.
---
There‚Äôs a spot up in Toxic Valley region that has a lead deposit AND a junk deposit. Although, it‚Äôs a pretty popular spot so you might be jumping worlds a bunch.
---
dgafferyCP is my name is anyone on xb1 wants to join up!
---
I can't say for everyone of course, but personally I just want to have some private space. 
---
My camp has three buildings, two of them (Workshop and Water/Food farm) plus all stuff outside are available to everyone and the third one is locked, that's where my bedroom with plushies, magazines/bobblehead collection and posters from my travels are. It's more homey looking than the rest of the camp and I wouldn't want to see there anyone but friends. Simply to avoid loosing that intimate feeling it has.
---
Since Fallout 4 was my first Fallout experience, I remember first encountering a Deathclaw and what a terrifying experience that was. And then the deathclaw that's in the witch building? Just beyond horrifying. 
---
I've never felt that way about them on here. They are no challenge and weren't so when I first started either. I also remember the Fog Crawlers being a major pain on Far Harbor but they're a joke here. I should not have more issues with a Yao Guai or Mirelurk King than either of those true Alpha Creatures. 
---
I'd love to see the deathclaws take back their throne. Can we have a cinematic cut screen of a deathclaw grabbing a hold of a SB and biting its head off? -I'm back, bitches-
---
There are plenty not in workshops.
---
https://fo76map.com/
---
Have checked a few resource maps, found a rather good interactive one online but most lead deposits were connected to workshops. Would suggest scattering some up north in in the map since most are center to south end of the map.
---
AA is better than TS IIRC.
---
Each modifier is 25% bonus damage, and explosive no longer scales with perks I believe.
---
If anyone has brick and metal building sets for sale, cheaper than the Whitesprings Vendor, let that guy know. I did not have any spare building sets. 
---
I'm not sure I've ever encountered those sets anywhere else, does anyone know if they drop when you claim camps?
---
keep getting the meat cleaver and meat weak flag plans....
---
Sell em
---
You have to craft stable flux with the raw flux,  stable flux doesnt spoil and its in your junk tab. 
---
Ingredients are 
---
1 hardened mass
---
1 glowing mass
---
1 high radiation fluid
---
10 raw flux(of the same color)
---
The super duper perk helps when your crafting stable flux, and the contractor perk will allow you to craft the decon shower with less materials. 
---
Flux is something that takes a long time to craft until you start hoarding the masses and fluids you need. The plants themselves are the easiest part. 
---
Mappalachia has maps of all the fluxes if you plan on dropping the nuke yourself.
---
More like "Far from heaven. Pennsylvania".
---
They need a buff and greater range. When I‚Äôm just a few meters away, I barely do any damage. When I‚Äôm up close, I should be blowing a ghoul‚Äôs brains out but instead they just shrug it off.
---
I had a lower level player follow me for 3 hours. He actually just wanted to learn how to get better at the game. So I showed him what I knew. He would give me scrap that he had. He said he wasn't interested in building yet. But after told me he was ready to give up on the game until I helped him understand it a bit more. That was prolly the nicest thing anyone has done for me in the game. I ended up giving him my legendary vamp pickaxe. I had it for almost 100 levels. It was my first lengendary I really liked. But he needed it more then I did.
---
So well done!
---
I'm still amazed how creative some members of the community like yourself can be, as I sit here posting from my 6x6 shack in an open field!
---
I must be doing Grahm's cook the wrong way. Collect and add greens, kill and add little animals, clean up, put out fire, add wood, feed Chally, add prime meat, drums, meatspin
---
They're already in the game files, just haven't been released.  Atomic Shop exclusive, of course.
---
[Here's what they look like](https://i.imgur.com/WgXA1Bb.png)
---
The heads and hands seem to be detachable. There are also power armor stands, which use the normal PA frame model.
---
I have a camp in the mire and it got absolutely savaged while i was in it restocking a vending machine. I have absoutley no idea what happened or how it happened so fast.  
---
 I wasn't on a team with anyone at all and I certainly wasn't in PvP or hostile with anyone so I figure that crosses out the possibility of another player? I heard a few shots with what sounded like a missle launcher and there were a few players around my camp so I just ignored it thinking it was someone messing around.  
---
Then everyone left from the sounds of it shortly after and the entire time I heard no PvE mob sounds at all nor was their any trace of anyhting or anyone when I went to check on my generator after I noticed my vending machine was off after I finished restocking.   
---
Tl;Dr: Maybe theres an exploit going around that allows players to damage other players camps without PvP being engaged?
---
I do that, was hoping for the Tenderizer plans, but am losing hope though.
---
I want to be able to display both outfits and power armor. Weapons were a great start. Time fke the next step.
---
She ran to Canada with the kids
---
Complete the quest line. She‚Äôs been a real pain in my ass for a while but I just did her whole thing and haven‚Äôt heard from her in about a week now
---
A bloodied is still in the top pvp builds. What beats 2 shotting someone. Gamma guns do some beastly damage to them, but at best its 50 50 who wins.
---
My melee main sings your praises you brave brave man!
---
Bruh I'm level 245, she still annoys me
---
YES
---
Yes!! I want to be terrified of a Deathclaw!
---
Have you completely completed the main quest? I accidentally hopped around and did stuff way out of order , but after finished her quest she shut right up
---
I have it all for sale all day on PS4!
---
There are two different Technical Data items. When you have unlocked the Forbidden Knowledge quest through having progressed the main story to that point, and the quest isn't currently active, you loot the first type which gives you the quest and needs to be handed in to end it. Under any other conditions (quest not yet unlocked or quest already active) you loot the second type of Technical Data which can not activate the quest. It is apparently possible to turn the second type into the first type by jumping through some hoops, but why bother? The Whitesprings Bunker is full of those things, so if you want to farm that mission for the PA paint jobs or whatever, wait until you have access to the Whitesprings Bunker, then empty out the place one Technical Data at the time. Unless you have a godly tolerance for grinding this mission, chances are you'll run out of patience long before you run out of Technical Data.
---
They need a receiver (as ammo types is not a Bethesda thing) that fires slugs and not pellet shots.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
All though a .50 caliber rifle shot should be more effective than a .45 pistol caliber lever action rifle (Lever action rifle with Hardened receiver does same damage as Hunting Rifle with .50cal receiver) .
---
In semi auto section Lever Action is doing enough damage, but most of everything else is just under powered compared to it.
---
In full auto section the same problem is with Handmade. It's in good spot, but totally blows Assault rifle and Combat rifle out of nuke zone.
---
No I finished that quest at level 30, she just annoys me
---
Pennsylvania! At least we aren't Ohio!
---
Damn that sucks, idk sorry I can‚Äôt help out more
---
Definitely agree dude that has been my sentiment. Adventure mode doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel‚Äù like the wasteland in other fallout games. I want there to be some conflict between groups of inhabitants and know when I help a certain faction, I am pitting myself against others.
---
I built mine in a tree so it's technically not floating
---
Why do you thi k that?
---
Unlikely as crafting is major problem in this game where previously if you made 300 items you crashed so I can't see Bethesda grasping on how to add this to the game without breaking the game further.
---
Garage door plans on the ground at Charlie always.
---
I didn't get to play it the first time. So no.
---
Ur cracking me up
---
Cant cuz all the flaccid players will cry and be moved
---
I absolutely love what you‚Äôve done, and the ambient sound effects couldn‚Äôt have been better. Also had the tiniest bit of a jump scare when vault girl popped up at the end lol. Nice!
---
Yeah no fucking relax man, there is absolutely no reason to play any video game for 40 hours likes that, especially not 76 for meat week. It‚Äôs absolutely coming back, and even if it wasn‚Äôt it still wouldn‚Äôt be worth it. Take care of yourself man that‚Äôs crazy
---
TS is 25% bonus damage total before armor, so it gives less than that, I forget what the math was as an end result for TS, but for AA the bonus was a 28% increase in damage.
---
I've had high level players drop me good guns, armor, stimpacks, etc a few times. Also had higher levels bail me out a few times when I stumbled across obscenely high level enemies. 
---
Then there's my good friend who back during the beta just stood by and laughed as I desperately tried to tank a level 50 legendary glowing one that came at me out of nowhere. Pretty sure I was only level 16 or 17 at the time.
---
Good idea until you realize that it eats up more camp space than ever like the bobble head stands...
---
I know! I wish I wrote down their username so I can repay them today, but instead I just help out new players.
---
What your describing sounds like nuclear winter.. The reason I like legendaries being involved is because it gives people alot of choices for different types of builds
---
Something like 5 or 6 of the best serums recipes require 5 gold each to craft. Gold is critical for serum salesmen,
---
enemies and their levels dont make a lick of sense to me. new to the game just hit 40. within 10 minutes I came up to a 40 something deathclaw and prepped for a good fight. went down easy. tp to a different area and found a legendary level 20 yaogi that killed me in 2 hits. nothing about what happened seems reasonable.
---
Yeah and nuclear winter is a nice levelish playing field, i would like an adventure style mide like that, because currently with legendaries i cannot do any damage whatsoever against someone with the full PvP build, and it makes me just not PvP because whats the point
---
Nobody will play it aside from the raiders. It will be like the early days of Survival. The only people in it made sure not to be holding any caps, meds or junk and just hung around train stations killing eachother for nothing. 
---
Then they all went back to seal clubbing in Adventure mode workshops.
---
With so many having them I‚Äôve given 5 away this time around. However I do sell the mods. I think I‚Äôve got 1 spicy left. The one I got first time around is on my wall and never comes off. After this week they‚Äôll be everywhere for cheap. The thrill is gone.
---
Yeah the whole perks + legendary combo makes PvP impossible for anyone not specced to it
---
Going with 34 luck and critical savvy would be better in my opinion since it guarantees criticals with every hit.
---
All so you can declare yourself the Hay King... err Corn King.
---
I might be wrong but wasn't Old Man Winter's head sold in the atomic shop during the event?
---
Also, criticals make all pellets hit regardless of the chance shown.
---
How many moths can vanish in a plume of smoke and also grant you a 5% XP bonus????
---
Thanks- I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs temporary, I‚Äôm getting a tracheotomy tube for a few months. Hadn‚Äôt clued in how gaming will be impacted until recently. Text in game  would make this a non issue
---
went to death claw valley once in NV. I've not felt fear like that since.
---
Best is Peppered and you get the plans by doing the event.
---
Lol I've been MIA Due to overcumbism, lol can fast travel x.x
---
But I'm getting there.
---
I have the Owl and the Soldier mask.
---
Haha all good mate. We're here when you're ready.
---
Congrats. Ive been farming for it all weekend an have done 36 of these meat event with no luck. Anywho I hear the salt on is good.
---
All i can say is most every build has a weakness, sometimes its hard to figure it out though
---
Hey, I may live here, but I know it's a shit hole. *My shit hole.*
---
I haven't played in months because of this issue. I'm moving soon and I gave my 70in smart TV to my wife for her move. My backup TV doesn't have the ability to turn off overscan. Every game has the edges cut off; this game is the worst. I can't see anything on the edges and it ruins it for me. Check your TV settings for something turning off overscan.
---
It'd be nice if the PS4 could compensate for this... Path of Exiles isn't affected too bad; that's getting my attention ATM.
---
Skyrim giants. Once you see it it can't be unseen.
---
That boy ain‚Äôt right
---
It's very weird, everytime the event happens i join and we never fail. But i have never gotten a plan for it. and what is the point of meat cleavers? And why 3?
---
Could be an overscan issue. Some slightly older or super off-brand TVs may not have the option; like my backup Coby TV.
---
Oh. Welp shouldve thought that through. I obviously mean more stash space. Mine is always full and i cant part with anything!
---
Same with the quarry (I forget the name)
---
Check CNN.
---
they just dont look natural, I want that slightly messy charm in my base with thing like a random handgun sitting on the shelf next to a stack of books.
---
I thought that was the quarry, the fact that they stuck it right on the road to the strip was cruel.
---
The only shot guns that are worth it are TSE, and even then they're so risky. If an enemy is in your face and you have demolition perk (you should) you're as good as dead if you shoot.
---
Always good when quality of life features that have been asked for almost bi-weekly gets added almost 2 years later....
---
Same, only reason to do it at all. 
---
Too bad there are lots of one-shot morons who rush the mob spawn points and kill them before others can engage. I usually stay near the drum and let mobs come to me, so others can also get on the killing, but lately seen a bunch of people just to go to the spawn area and kill the mobs there as soon as they appear.
---
There was a red one and a moon man that I know of being on the shop and supposedly 10 different masks dropped from the event.
---
Imo it feels like something after wastelanders hits. Someone‚Äôs gotta rule those people.
---
Idk who was running those tests but the TS doubles the base damage.
---
All the items are random. I kept getting tenderizer while others keep getting mods. Cleavers are the inbetween throwable. Somewhere between knifes and tomahawks. (Which is a very rare plan).
---
There‚Äôs a node just west of Appalachian antiques
---
No thanks, I have those.
---
Your not crazy. No release date yet. Just like the New Feature: Legendary Players ‚Äì An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities has never came around yet either. This was supposed to be part of Summer release.
---
Ha
---
I‚Äôm going to be leaving Pennsylvania for New York
---
See you in fallout 5 
---
(oh shit I wasn‚Äôt supposed to leak that)
---
Cheap? It will be very rare after the event ends! Selling for at least 8k!
---
I believe that after a couple of years (Wastelanders + a couple more major waves of wasteland immigrants to Appalachia) and you will have to go to different factions, earn their favor, and they will vote for you, in a sort of reputation system. Could be what all of those ballot boxes everywhere are for!
---
Then why is salty more valuble?
---
Ya idc what anyone says if theres 10 people and ur that 1 guy who killed the prime beast before any 1 could get a shot on it ur a scumbag. And no the event was not about to fail. How could it fail when dick head is killing everything before it spawns
---
There is no tenderizer plan, sadly.
---
I think that's nice repayment in and of itself. :)
---
I wouldn't go as far as saying they hate vegas, they have added or nodded to a few things added by obsidian (new nuka flavors in nuka world, and and the robobrain actress in far harbor)
---
This is so sweet, and what a nice compliment for him to give you!
---
I stick by my golden rule. Play a game three times. 
---
Once to try it. Another understand it. And again to master it. If after the third time you don‚Äôt feel it clicking. Then the game isn‚Äôt for you. 
---
Start a business. Open a restaurant and sell meats. Build a church, hotel, chem den, you name it. 
---
Create a unique and personal build that speaks to you.
---
Ships? Legendaries out of machines? WOULD SOMBODY PLEASE EXPLAIN THIS ENTIRE POST FOR A DUMMY LIKE ME?!
---
Ha, I remember the days when my boyfriend and I would try Whitespring below level 50. We died more times than we killed lol.
---
Might be something that was planned in the start, when they were visualizing a PvP free for all Fallout 76. 
---
Too bad they had no idea of their player base who didn't want anything to do with PvP and just wanted a multiplayer free roaming Fallout 4.
---
Where?????
---
 I want to go &amp; live with the Amish. They won't kill me, &amp; I can learn to trust again
---
oh sorry im stumped
---
I agree. People are running to prime cuts at the same time the cookout is going on and by the time people show up we fall short or not bothering at all and failing completely.
---
Please dumb down everything you just said. What machine can give you cheap legendaries?
---
It started in the 80's
---
Ohhh. I thought cleavers where melee weapons
---
Had my camp near a lead vein in the north of the map, bit south of crashed space Station.
---
I can't wait to read your obituary after your next gaming session.
---
I‚Äôve read it! That‚Äôs actually what got me thinking about dropping 4LC for Crit Savvy. =)
---
Huh. Send my best to Ashur.
---
I thought that only applied to the pip-boy...is there a mod for the stash?
---
Virtue signaling.
---
The devs are capable of prioritisation. Or everyone would get a 12,00 lbs stag limit that breaks the game.
---
A good suggestion will be added to a wishlist. They've said they welcome feedback, and the earlier things are suggested, the easier it is to add into a roadmap at an appropriate time.
---
Suggesting something doesn't mean you're forcing the studio to drop everything they're doing and put it in tomorrow. Furthermore, feedback reduces the chance of them potentially putting in tedious or unpopular content or mechanics.
---
I'm not long for bed I'll buy some tomorrow
---
*dashboarded
---
The was pre nerf post nerf is 25%
---
yeah dude don't drive
---
Don't bother going to NY. Everybody is leaving. The taxes are too high. Even the feral ghouls have left.
---
This, but the brahmin dramatically slows you down, like a power armour without a fusion core.
---
Otherwise you could just have a mobile stash box, which seems a bit broken.
---
If you are on pc there is an in game mod for it
---
Psn?
---
The machine that you put legendaries into to get scrip, other people (if fast enough and have enough scrip) can buy whatever you just put into the machine
---
The whole event is already scripted and set up its just never been used
---
How do you get the black smoke please?
---
P.S. Excellent C.A.M.P by the way
---
I know, but I‚Äôm thinking they will change it. If it was the final build they wanted to use, it would probably already be in the game
---
If I get anymore I‚Äôll give them away too. I seen 3 ppl get one at the same rip today. They‚Äôll be everywhere. You can charge that and some idiot will pay it that‚Äôs for sure. Like I said the rarity is gone. This is the second time around and for 7 days think about the number of ppl grinding this non stop. The drop rate maybe low but if there‚Äôs 2000 of them or even 1000, then there not that rare. Then they‚Äôll be a third meat week with the same drop. Good luck on your sell.
---
Just take a photo of it with your camera in game? Or add a picture to the photos folder if on PC?
---
Actually since you want to be such a shit head about it let people play the way they fucking want and don't judge them for how they do it. No one tells you how to play so don't go being such a rude asshole.
---
It came with the mothman cultist bundle back when it first came out. I think it was exclusive to the bundle?
---
It's perfect for something like this, I wish the game would let us build more than one.
---
It is shit.. honestly I thought I enjoyed this game and now I‚Äôve given up it‚Äôs so bad.. there‚Äôs nothing to it at all it‚Äôs just lacking in almost every way I‚Äôm done playing it.
---
Isn‚Äôt the flatwoods monster in the queen of the hunt daily?
---
the engine has a hard enough time trying to do one thing at a time, can you imagine if it tried to craft 300 of one thing instantly?
---
I mean I want it to change when you're on the fast travel screen/map.  I'm not a fan of the default with the Vault-Boy in the corner.
---
Is there anything actually there
---
it was datamined content, never officially acknowledged by Beth
---
Well all armor and weapons max out at 50 so the only real advantage you have is more perks. So unless you have a good build to compliment your gear level doesn‚Äôt really mean anything.
---
So my level is pointless. Great.
---
That is one seriously well-thought out and decorated maze.  I LOLed at the x's over the eyes on the paintings... clever touch.  Reminds me of the local Halloween attractions around here... I love it!
---
Serendipity my friend
---
Past 50 levels really don‚Äôt matter.
---
Why do you want to?
---
Truth is, I never cared for Meat Week the first time around, actually.
---
This event most certainly did not need to be unlocked; it was "filler" material, something to keep people occupied until Wastelanders is released. Just recycle an old event and dress it up a little, and a lot of people will buy into it.
---
I have a post involving the HOAWasteland
---
Power of Bethesda levelling. Doesn‚Äôt matter how high your level is, you will always be weak
---
Yeah level means almost nothing in this game. It's all about gear and your build.
---
Thank you for answering, appreciated
---
That bug as been around since Wild Appalachia begun.
---
You sure the 50 that killed you wasn't someones alt?
---
You realize that is not what he said, right? Your level gives you a tactical advantage in making efficient perk builds. You just have to use it.
---
I love my pump action shotty, then I bought two-shot combat expecting a big upgrade and meh, dunno why but it feels bad.
---
That happened to me once looking in the direction of the sun rays at WS fire station but I would get multi colors.
---
Levels mean nothing in this game past 50. Sounds like you would do best to keep pacifist mode on until you do at least a little bit of research
---
I've seen this phrase before, as well as Sheepsquatchs
---
You're probably not even talking about the correct mask. You're talking about the fasnacht man mask? No way your giving one of the rarest items ever made for this game away the old man an jesters mask. Litterally only 2 people got it across all platforms.
---
Your getting attacked by Power Armors be Careful ü§£
---
You need water, lots of it.
---
All energy drinks dehydrate you and are bad for your heart, and so is staying up for 40 hours. Not eating anything while staying up all night does some real damage. 
---
I used to stay up all night, but when you get older it gets harder, cuz it legitimately shortens your lifespan, and the more you do it the more you feel that. 
---
I seriously doubt its the turrets, your ears would be ringing. Your body feels like shit because you abused it.
---
But I'm still not a doctor, if your still lightheaded and are throwing up water, you need to go the hospital. Seriously you gotta drink water.  If you cant keep any liquids down they put you on an I.V. to stop you literally drying up like a prune.
---
I wish they'd put more effort into it. I know it's *supposed* to be a cashgrab but stuff like the liberty prime skin and the death riders show they can put out some really nice stuff when they feel like it.
---
nothing like stopping the invasion of MODUS controlled power armors
---
They look like synths.
---
https://discord.gg/9aDRTur Discord community - Wasteland Republic is recruiting fun friendly adult players. We run speedy triple nukes.
---
All I get is meat cleavers and the chefs hat
---
what happened to the camouflage combat armors?
---
I accidentally found this out as well and explored EVERYTHING. There‚Äôs nothing out there. It‚Äôs also really eerie, the day/night cycle is different out there, the time is different, and all in game music/ambiance stops except for your footsteps. Just a whole bunch of trees. Got some great pictures though.
---
It really helps with headshots and hip firing
---
I would just wait for wastelanders. I got about 150 hours on it and it‚Äôs just not fun anymore in its current state. Seriously how much fun is making a business when you will realistically almost never have somebody stop by? 
---
Also people say it‚Äôs more fun with friends, you know what else is more fun with friends? Lighting a bag of dog shit on fire and leaving it on a doorstep. 
---
Sadly it still feels like a grind and a blatant money grab from a developer who is capable of much more than what they are providing.
---
Unfortunately I have lost a good legendary about two months ago for this exact reason. Got a fantastic roll out of nuked whitesprings for BE 2* Assault rifle, server crashed, and it reset the last five minutes or so for me. I even spawned on the opposite side of whitesprings at the station, which was where I was before walking to the ghoul area. I didn't have the weapon anymore. Was really bummed and quit playing for like two days to cool off. It can happen, it's just not likely, but I have shit luck so.. lol
---
Given how sad dmg energy weapons have  (especially lasers) and fact that enemies have really high energy resistances I would say that they are still laughing.
---
Xbox here..price on old man winter?
---
Free play weekend would be a good boost
---
Deathclaws have always been super weak in 3D fallout games. Even in NV the Cazador was WAY more dangerous then the deathclaw
---
I'll take it
---
This is fantastic. You've got us feeling all spooky now just in time for October!

Pick up the Tin Cans and tin can traps, lots of lead there.

Reg Gatling gun, not plasma.

Hi there, did you have any luck with this in the end?
---
I had it twice and the second time he disappeared his name was still there so I yeeted a grenade where he was and he came back, he might just be invisible to make you think he disappeared

---
 &gt; Hi there, did you have any luck with this in the end?
---
Well I‚Äôve been hoping for a fair and fast paced PVP mode in FO76 just like COD Hardcore Free For All, but looks like it won‚Äôt ever happen. NW is all we‚Äôre gonna get for fair pvp fights, but the wait is too long and being unable to use my fav weapons kind of kept me away from it. When COD MW comes out I‚Äôll surely dive into it for some real pvp action (haven‚Äôt even played the storyline mode in previous CODs).
---
You want fair PVP yet want to use your favourite weapons, which are no doubt loaded with legendary perks.
---
Xbox here, and have noticed the same in our worlds. You know the player pool is getting shallow when you server hop and start recognizing the same old names on players camp locations. Hopefully it will pick up as you stated.
---
Nope i don‚Äôt want legendary effects in pvp, it‚Äôs just not fair for those who don‚Äôt have it.
---
Yea that definitely needs work before we can have a serious PVP campaigns. I play shotgun/rifle build because I love these weapons in every game but I'm so damn useless in Fallout PVP because of how OP other weapons are. I can literally stand and shoot a dude whole day in the face with shotgun and do nothing while he'll mow me down in a second with some automatic weapon then start jumping 20 meters high like a gummy bear and stealth disappear.
---
The whole idea is to keep it on same servers. It doesn't affect you if you don't want to participate. Neutral players can't be attacked :)
---
Idk what level you are but make sure your gear is the correct level 
---
On another note yeah I‚Äôve noticed Yao guais are hitting way harder same with feral ghouls
---
It's hugely overpriced and I wish *some* of the content in the shop was just available through regular gameplay instead.
---
If I had to choose one thing to absolutely change, though, I'd make stuff from bundles available outside of the bundle too. I shouldn't have to buy a whole bunch of extra stuff just cause I want one piece of the selection.
---
This is a survival game... they are supposed to make things harder, not easier.
---
That's fucked up.  When I did my first I had a high level come in but he showed me what to do and let me launch.
---
That's exactly what I was thinking, maybe I wasn't clear enough. Participating in the war is a choice you'll have once you join a faction. A way to prove yourself wether it's the fighting other players on the frontlines or supporting the cause by completing pve objectives. This whole faction war is not a separate server or a separate mode. It would be part of the adventure mode that is optional to participate in.
---
I live right next to it and don't even bother doing it. There's no point, it's not fun, the rewards are wack as fuck, and half the ppl that show up have no idea what to do anyways. It's just annoying at this point.
---
That would just make things complicated, how about Garvey the demon
---
I've been playing 150 hours and seen him 3 times.
---
First 2 times he just disappeared, 3rd time he didn't. 
---
Wasn't much of a fight and it dropped next to nothing. Was a bit disappointing...
---
if your born after 85 - your a millennial. I know you want to be Gen X but your not that cool.
---
I think that too, especially when you get all the rewards during the first iteration. Now I only do Prime Cuts in Mire or Bog for best exp and only from time to time, if there aren't any good events on the map.
---
Executioner's fast fire weapon will wreck any bloodied in a second or two... if you make it in time.
---
Meat Cleavers, Tato Salad, Beer, Tenderizer, Spicy Mod, Hats and Outfits, Flag Plans Recipies...a bit of everything really...oh and some pieces of scrip armor lol
---
When is Bethesda gonna listen...
---
You should make a post about this, suggest to Bethesda to implement your idea into the game and they might respond to it with a new patch. Best to give it a try because I think we all need this fix for the game.
---
Liberators if I recall correctly
---
As documented on [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Technical\_data](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Technical_data) there are two base IDs for Technical Data, i.e. two completely different item templates. One is a quest item (and presumably has the scripts attached), the other isn't (and presumably doesn't). Which leads me to believe that all the cries about bugged TD are wrong, and the behaviour is - though not exactly player friendly - as intended.
---
But even if the drop behaviour I described isn't what's actually happening, the superficial result is still the same: There is no point in hoarding, buying or selling Technical Data. The ones stacked in your inventory can not retroactively re-activate the quest except by jumping through some contorted loops - you need to loot a fresh Technical data out of a container. And given that Whitesprings Bunker is full of the stuff, there is really no reason to hold on to those stacks, because finding new TD is easy.
---
I've noticed this also . I feel way easier to kill against the same enemies you mentioned
---
It could happen when consuming plans or recipes as well, quite annoying (PC). The workaround I found is to assign food/drinks to the favorites wheel and consume from there (doesn't work for plans though).
---
I suspect this is a deep engine bug of which get fixed occasionally as someone from Beth HQ has to fly down to Austin and manually code there...
---
I use them for my reg armor + weapos + PA
---
Holy cripes! Dream weapon. Will break faster because of the TSE, but gatlings are durable and cheap to fix. Demolition expert, stabilized, one gun army are a  must.
---
Ya know the fallout community on redit i think is so great, it seems just about everyone does what they can to help each other in any way they can. From most the things I read on here, I wish I could say my in game experience was the same when it comes to other players. Honestly I love fallout 76, it's the only game I play, and have played since it came out. The hole experience I get out of it, I can't find in any other game. 
---
Iv lived in wv my entire life, seeing the same things everyday when I walk out side just bores me to death. The game let's me see this place in a totally different way, I think that's why I enjoy 76 so much, plus i love to see the shit they got right and wrong lol.  I mean yea it has its bugs here and there some big and some small, for some reason I find its sort of easy to look past most of them, but the one thing that breaks my heart the most is how no one in game gives me the time of day. I'm currently lvl 93 and I'm stumped. I wish I knew things then, that I'm currently learning now.  I wish I had people to talk to in the game or even someone to have a learning experience with. But every day I log on, no matter what server all I seem to find is high lvls just fast traveling camp to camp to see what they can buy, or someone rushing to kill a legendary before I can even pull the trigger. Iv even tried teaming up with low lvl people, iv literally given most of my stash box away multiple times just trying to get someone to team up. Alot of the time they accept the invite but 2-3 minutes tops they leave the server.. yea I loose the shit, but I don't care, I play enough that I get the stuff back pretty quick..
---
 I know this comment is probably to much, way to deep ( I realize it. ) I just want someone to play with that bad lmao.. if anyone out there reads this and would ever wanna team up, I think that would be awsome. My PSN:
---
Cptgomerpyle832
---
Also, I don't want people to read this and feel that I'm complaining or trying to make anyone feel sorry or whatever. Game wise I want to be part of something alittle more
---
I have also noticed my weapon was breaking crazy fast today in comparison with before
---
Congrats! It's such a cool looking weapon. Just a shame they're so damn heavy! Someone actually walked up and gave me theirs so I'm guessing they were overencumbered and max stash. As a rifle build I can't justify keeping them but what's the going rate for these things? I've sold two for 100c just to free up a bit of space quickly as I'm always max stash due to my vendors, but are they worth more? They did fly out at that price.
---
The engine treats power armor frames as entities like the rest of the mobs its just displaying the wrong name for the defense event
---
[](/kflamindispensable)I'm going to recommend slower, it's got better ammo econ, and breaks slower.
---
[](/flamepony)It's pretty lame honestly, flares and rockets are better fireworks IMO.
---
Noo ESO ur spending  coin on every 1,000 coin u have ur item marked as so a 5k item costs 700 for the seller just to post it
---
The mouth harp as a junk item
---
do you mean you can't find the flora that is used to craft flux?  or are you looking for flux on the ground?  it isn't something that is found, you need to craft it
---
Honestly I think it should just notify you that you already have that key in a message and just not pick up duplicates
---
There is no source....other than the hundreds of posts on here about it after the raid launched.
---
I feel like it's over saturation, I know we all want shorter timers between events but it feels like this event is never not going on
---
I like this idea but I‚Äôd rather it take place slightly North and east of the F76 Map, in DC and The Pitt. The Pitt houses the Raiders and DC houses the Wastelanders. You explore both area‚Äôs and can take over settlements like in Nuka World for F4.
---
level doesn't mean anything past 50, also you probably don't have a meta build
---
3 guys with Prime Ultracite Gatling Lasers can slay the Queen in roughly 1min.
---
But sure, laugh away!
---
I have GUNS and NOT GUNS :P
---
Both would be cool, and a shared stash between characters. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Haha. I play it every day and totally love it but I still kind of agree with you. I spend so long farming materials for my shop just to give people interesting things and bargains. That is kind of weird, that my hobby is running a virtual shop, and probably one I put more effort into than my actual job. But I'm okay with weird. What you say is true though: a couple of weeks ago I moved to the Mire and spent a full day building a beautiful camp. But because it was slightly off the beaten track, I had hardly any customers and my stash became constipated, to use a terrible metaphor, so I had to move a couple of days later. I am now nearish the bottom of Savage Divide and things are still a bit slow. I get nowhere near the amount of traffic I did when I lived closer to Whitesprings.
---
Not that I know of, but I see them around Lake Reynolds pretty regularly regardless of level.
---
I didn't do this event the first time around. When I started joining I didn't know what the hell I was doing but the more times I join the better i'm getting at it. It seems to me as far as the prime cuts goes I've only been seeing 2 people joining and the cook out, I have joined and it be several people there and it's a failure.
---
Nothing interesting apparently, probably still worth a look though
---
I just nuke the players that come into my silo. Did it a few days ago the player watched his base get blown up ü§£
---
And 3 guys with meat hooks can kill her in 5 sec after she lands...  So yea ill keep laughing...
---
WOW! mind if I ask what your build is? Also never knew you could sneak attack the queen ü§Ø
---
I don't care for it I don't even know why everyone wanted it back.  I would've preferred another 2x xp weekend or a cool sb trophy from the atom stop for free.
---
Bloodied build mate.
---
I love my quad double barrell, its my favourite legendary weapon because it actually feels cool. The problem with shotguns that I have found is that enemies with a larger HP pool literally heal 90% of the damage done when you shotgun them, which is absolutely terrible and gamebreaking.  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ZD5Ny52D4&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ZD5Ny52D4&amp;feature=youtu.be)  I made a video a while back showing the issue. I had all the shotgun perks so should be doing massive damage but unfortunately not.  It does the exact same thing on normal lvl 62 ghouls as well
---
It's rare, but I was lucky to get this plan at least 4 times. Once you have plan you can craft guns (using Backwoodsman 8) ans scrap them for mods - I was able to get all mods for it quite fast actually.
---
The silo will shut down for 3 hours after it has been launched, but you can launch from another one. You can check the silo status with the silo holotape if you kept it, or you can buy another from the command deck in the bunker.
---
I'd even settle for say a set of plans you can get that gives you this ability.
---
I think the game greatly falls short with giving you this sort of stuff.
---
So as you advance you can get more efficient
---
I did this in the bottom left corner of the map. Follow the river.
---
You can't use it in the raid sadly.
---
Ok, thanks
---
to give you and idea what a "total freeze" looks like [https://youtu.be/fvelS7hp0pA](https://youtu.be/fvelS7hp0pA)
---
those are not the exception, but the rule whenever i shot something with a toughness of a Deathclaw or higher
---
i already sent this to Bethesda over a 1 week long ticket conversation. End results was them saying "we relayed this to the Devs and they will look into it"
---
You can pick them up off a roof top. There not worth anything.
---
I recently quit after traveling for a couple of weeks in the summer. Tbh I am waiting for the wastelanders update and have recently booted up Skyrim for the 99th time. Sometimes just putting a game down makes me getting interested again in it after a while.
---
Im with you brother..it is a bit shit and no fastnacht
---
There easy to get hold of... Just not a lot of people knew of its whereabouts early on in the game. I know of 3 places they spawn.
---
I noticed sales in 5.56 have dropped. I would put 20,000 in vending and it would sale out in a hour. Now I've had 18,000 in there for 2 days. I'm not a PvP player myself but when bored our group will randomly playfully fight each other. I'm really going to miss all those easy caps. I'm going to keep making them because there is no way PvP is going to completely go away. Maybe the test server will be a free for all.
---
more iron deposits. I wish there was a mine like the Lucky Hole is for lead.
---
"hours"

Running a silo takes 20 minutes max.
---
Nah, mate... I dont think being born before or after a certain year makes you cool... do you?
---
I've just never been called or called anyone a millennial before. And since I feel calling someone that is on the same level of cringe as calling someone a snowflake, I've never bothered to learn the definition.
---
But, hey, I was starting to feel my age and now I feel a lot younger knowing I'm a millennial...
---
getting the keycard does not, not to mention other resources
---
OP didn't have time to use his keycard anyway as the launch was "stolen", so all good.
---
Plus you can easily find keycard from other player's vendor machines.
---
mammologist instead of hunting
---
I enjoy it, just because it seems to get people together and is nice for farming xp. I think they should have added new rewards. Seems so lazy and shitty to just do the same exact event, same everything. That does make it boring tbh.
---
did you read the post?  it says it took OP's keycard, sure, other players sell them but can you not see how this could be a shitty experience for OP?  his literal first silo run, during the main quest, and it is ruined because of bad game design
---
Huh you entered Ohio then. Pennsylvania is the north/northwest side of the map, Capital Wasteland is northeast straight past Thunder Mountain Power Plant/Harpers Ferry.
---
Hmm south? I guess would be Kentucky/parts of Tennessee (If we can somehow get there with the same method.)
---
Edit ah correction on my part: You hit Kentucky. Ohio is west of Point Pleasant. Damn sleep deprivation...
---
Genius idea
---
Because it's not worth more then 25 caps, if that.
---
If you wear full unyielding, then theres actually a good chance to get it from the machine. I always get them.
---
What are you trying to sell it for? I sell them for 50 caps.
---
I have 32 shotguns but i change my shotgun character becau its sucks, if i shot to close to me with explosive shotgun i damage myself, if im in range im doing no damage, its juts sucks now..
---
Sry, I am dumb üôÉ
---
On my account bloodied doesn't change the damage output, been bugged for me since beta.
---
I would add some events, not all mind, but some like One Violent Night and Uranium Fever, you get tons of mobs to kill and you get the xp from the event
---
I noticed it about a month ago when battling the Mirelurk Kings. I know a lot of experienced players were complaining about how easy the game was so maybe Bethesda cranked it up a little bit.
---
for some reason my tech data separated itself in both the stash and inventory. Had 49, 35, 19 and 1 and it only took the single data. It only triggered after I picked up one from a chest. Actually gave me BOS CPT paint. Was actually the first time I ever received a PA paint. Level 200 too.  Then again I shouldn't be surprised it took so long to see this. Just like the only explosive weapon I ever saw in game was one I purchased from a vendor, never once has one dropped.  The game is strange ~~sometimes~~...ALL the time.
---
a lot of good suggestions here, but I would like to stress the aid, cranberry recipes and canned meat stew from Feed The People give an xp boost, always rest, and kill all the enemies
---
SWEET!   I seem to always find him free climbing the sides of mountains for some reason. You will see him again, be prepared! ..lol
---
Also just as a side note don't keep supply requisition holotapes in your stash looking to save up. I have over 140 in there at the moment and can't remove them or lost them for sale. When I take them out one by one they appear in my inventory to use but increase the number in my stash. If I try to remove alll it says my carry limit will be to high and the same if I try to list them for sale in bulk. Luckily they don't take up stash space but it's really annoying.
---
Okay so I'm not crazy.
---
I don't run that perk until a PVP wannabe gets aggro in Adventure mode.
---
But yeah scorchbeasts used to be the only enemy I'd have second thoughts about fighting. I'd actually change my route somewhere when I heard the flapping.
---
Now there's sheepsquatch and that's it.
---
  That wouldn't be a bad thing. It would help the game adhere more to a survival experience and expand the use of perk cards more. It may help cut down on inventory space in two ways I can think of immediately. One, we will explore at a slower pace. Two, we would use items at faster pace or at least force better organisation.
---
I've only run into 3 time since I started playing back in November. The first time was probably at least six months ago. I got one shot off and he ran. Next two times was just last month. I got a seemingly random encounter with ghouls wondering why the hell they were pink. I was trying to run away from them only to head right into him. Managed to take him out and finally get the reward for beating one of every cryptid. Third time I was trying to take out a scorchbeast only to notice him and several scorched turning pink. Found and took out the Flatswoods Monster again though he gave a better fight than the first time. I blame the scorchbeast.
---
Why did you stop playing on Xbox?
---
The Brotherhood of Steel - Hellfire Chapter is always looking for new recruits. 
---

Sentinel Looch
---
It may also help promote co-op.
---
Honestly technical data is so bugged, it seems to work different for every character. I have one character that gets a free turn in on every server hop and one character that can't activate extras from a bag or from a stash.
---
Taking a serum for a mutation you already have negates all side effects of all your mutations for an hour?? I‚Äôve never heard of this
---
Sometimes jerks will kite SB's to a camp as well.
---
His keycard is still there. If the OP goes back to the same silo when they attempt to put a card in it will give an error sound. They can now proceed to the keypad.
---
RP in Fallout! Hell yeah! Sentinel Looch! I shall try to set up a Discord once I‚Äôm done with dinner! 
---
Just be good to keep the social element to the game, you know?
---
And honestly, little toxic and I don‚Äôt play my Xbox much anymore, got the PC, so figured why not start again, love the whole Fallout franchise!
---
Neither of the suggestions in this thread worked for me.
---
I got 2 tenderizers too. N sold off ny meat cleaver plan for 50caps. ;)
---
its been safe
---
the bug only occurred a handful of poeple, under certain cercumstances, that was easy to avoid, that could not be easily duplicated by others, and bethesda worked on it in p13, with no instances since
---
I don't know about the yao guai - they've always felt pretty tough and dangerous to me, much more so than deathclaws, actually - but then I'm mostly melee, which is what their stagger attack is designed to counter.
---
But yeah apparently in conjunction with the release of the raids ghouls and mirelurk kings (and all the other critters that turn up in the raids) were buffed globally.
---
I also recently noticed one particular type of super mutant wielding assault rifles which dishes out a lot more damage - much more so than any other non-behemoth super mutant. They're kind of like the ballistic Mr. Gutsies that way. But I'm not sure whether those were changed, or whether I'm only now encountering them in significant numbers.
---
&gt; Got some great pictures though.
---
share?
---
I almost always am able to make it to another one that's if I get to kill them or not
---
Sounds like it was not us. But if you want assistance and or a couple of keycards shoot a pm and I can help out. If my memory serves me right the person that I saw on the map was level 64.
---
This! It's not worth investing 5 points in it. The 1st point gives you most of the benefit.
---
It's very safe. Me and my group have been running it every day with out insident
---
I agree.
---
Drop them on the ground :p. But seriously the other posts are right, use any relay tower to call down a air drop. Debatable if they are worth it though.
---
Oh thanks, but I‚Äôm on XBox üòä Appreciate it very much though.
---
Oh really, bummer üôÑ
---
lol OP didn't come here for a life evaluation.
---
You can find keys for 20‚Ç¨/$. If you like you will play at least 200 hours. It's a good deal.
---
Respectfully disagree. Grahm and Chally are wonderful, the Prime Cuts events give some \*great\* XP, and although the rewards for the Meat Cook aren't the best, they're far from the worst, either. Having Grahm readily accessible gives you the opportunity to get some of the rarer plans off him, as well.
---
Also, I love that yellow plastic drum. +100 from me on that.
---
I was in the Burrows other say and this SM with assault rifle was tearing through my PA like paper. Absolutely insane damage. Never had that issue before.
---
The Yao guai stun lock is devastating, even with my high damage bloodied DCG I can get one maybe if I'm still in sneak but once I'm revealed and there are three of them it's instant death, makes for an exciting tactical fight, love it!
---
Legendary Players is a system they intend to implement, but keep pushing back because they haven't been quite satisfied with what has been designed behind the scenes so far.
---
The Presidential Race is cut content. We could end up seeing it down the road like we did backpacks/scoust or like we will with bows in Wastelanders, but it also may never come out.
---
Joined. Ty for the link.
---
My Bloodied handmade level 45 1\* was 12K for comparison.
---
It'll only sell to people who don't know it's a static spawn on top of West-Tek roof. The rest can get it with cost of fast traveling there...
---
A few weeks ago I saw the "kill an alien while wearing a tin-foil hat" atom challenge and just for the hell of it obtained a tin foil hat.
---
But, no sign of the Flatwoods Monster in the usual places.
---
Until I happened to visit Abby's bunker and *there it was*!  Much shooting and teleporting and purple flashes and, finally, it was laying dead on the ground in front of me.
---
At which point I realised that I'd forgotten to put the damned tinfoil hat on.
---
That would be hilarious, being attacked by hoards of Power Armor frames, please I want this!
---
If you find yourself strapped to a table at Point Pleasant awaiting sacrifice, surrounded by mothman eggs and the Mothman's believers, know it's because of this post.
---
Visual text bug, I get random things showing in in that popup all the time.
---
I'm running an i5 6400, 8 gig ddr4 ram and a rx460 4gb and don't have issues, frame rates from 40-75 depending on area @1080p, don't have graphics cranked obviously but graphics don't make the game. Wife's set up is i5 2400, 8 gig ddr4 ram and 1050ti slimline 4gb, plays the same as mine. As for gameplay, it's fun, there's still game braking bugs, crashes to desktop, lock ups, freezes, and all the usual Bethesda bullshit, but half the time the glitches and bullshit is funny and adds to the game. If you're a fallout 4 fan you will enjoy it.
---
VATS crit build makes this less of an issue.
---
There are two safes there, a level 3 and level 1 I think. You can reroll safes by not looting and server hopping if you want.
---
On a server i was on last night a team launched 3 nukes one after the other, it was loads of fun, 3 queen fights in a row! I'd just make it back to my camp to unload my stuff and repair my gear and the nuke warning would go again!
---
Had the same thing myself. Waited until 3 months ago to buy it and have played almost every day since. If you're a fallout fan you are going to enjoy it.
---
For me the issue is still there. I don't use gunsmith at all for my heavy gunner and my guns break every maybe couple days. They're really easy to maintain, plus I can carry a huge variety to use as buckaups because of bear arms. My Rifleman must use ran 5 gunsmith and my guns still break multiple times a day, and it's a hassle cause I cant carry backups without my armor requiring me to have WWR perks on it. Why should my shotgunner, suffering from no armor pen, horrible range, horrible accuracy, have to use rank 5 gunsmith, *and* 3 more points in luck of the draw, 8 points, just for me to be able to clear west tek one time? It just seems they need a rework and I think most people agree. Luck of the draw should be a luxury, not a necessity, just like white knite.
---
Tooltip. I don't have any conclusive evidence though, so it might or might not work. Just like everything in this game.
---
I switched from shotgunner to heavy junkies gunner and I gotta say, I love heavy guns. I still occasionally switch back out but the fact my junkies explosive combat shotgun cant even clear out the white springs clubhouse without breaking leaves a bad taste in my mouth every time.
---
type in solo scorch beast queen in youtube there's a bunch of videos of meat hook builds doing 4-5k damage per swing on her.
---
Yea from now on I will keep evidence to prove something to some dumbass in discusion on video game...
---
Same reason people have to ask where the bathroom is in a place they don't know.
---
Think its the last bit about players being slow. Literally one path into my home and where they get lost is a forking hallway one path has arrows and letters saying shop above it. The moment they go into the hallway my signs become invisible to most players, Perception -30.
---
All the time lol!
---
I keep pressing the red button to exit from vats when I should be pressing the same for enabling vats. 
---
Numerous times I've opened the pip-boy menu during a fight. It's funny now but very annoying during a serious fight.
---
Seems like a full server wide war would really lag out the server thou!
---
Then WHY DO I HAVE ONE !?!? It turns shit purple and I cant mod it but it also don't break... what's it DO???
---
Here's your complementary parking chair
---
Agreed but don't think that's the issue here.
---
A better idea would be to release an uncapped version of the map in another game mode with mobs scaling up to 100 in the global world :)
---
it would also enable high level players to revisit the forest and enjoy having a challenge in there.
---
Assuming they make the mobs in the forest capable of spawning as legendary :)
---
Settled for flamers and rad emitters.
---
Yeah, I've had it happen 4 times now. It really needs to lock out other people when someone is inside, except teammates. It's incredibly frustrating.
---
 Did you want me to start a shooting and get 'wanted' for accidentally hitting a wall? It was a study on game mechanics.
---
Yesterday 2 Bluescreens in NW and one infinitive load.
---
This happened  to me this weekend I would load into a World only to be immediately disconnected from the server. I ran a speed test on my Ps4 and I had a 6.9 mbps connection I pay for a 100 mbps connection. Luckily the problem went away within an hour for me.
---
Again. THIS you respond to? Sure, it's another great maze, but your community expects even passing comment on the pressing issues brought up each day/week/month. A bug burn-down list would do WONDERS for your PR.
---
The game is far too laggy in the current version of the game to be any fun, I'll return if and when they make it more stable again!
---
This.
---
so thats why my hoppings were not working, I just have to unlock it and leave it then huh? What about inworld games man such as magazines and bobbleheads, should I leave them too if I'm looking for a specific one?
---
I eat them straight away, nice and fresh.
---
I'm not as hyped about it as last time. There are no new rewards and the rare weapon weighs 20. I'm happy to collect the plans but it would be a lot more nice if they had added some new things. Maybe like a red firework mine plan or the mutant grill that we never got last time.
---
Never, ever use charged barrels. They are extremely bad for damage (6x slower fire rate, not even 2x damage per shot). You can find fusion cores everywhere, ammo is never a problem. And gatling lasers last many cores, especially when you use Gunsmith perk.
---
here's my idea. Take each cosmetic stash box, and duplicate it but each with a tag for item types (weapon, armor, junk, etc.) add an extra one, "Public" or something to the effect of take an item, leave an item. That way it doesn't add much if any load to the server, it just locks the box to pay attention to only one tab. The extra public box may be a bit of code but it basically is just making an ordinary box with two-way placement that could have a cap on capacity and a limit on how many you can build like the vendors.
---
Still busy fucking yours.
---
Yes it would work flawlessly, you input the number and the game will check how many you have in your inventory against the Crafting total which is times together by 300. With a few calculations and a few variable changes that's all it is.
---
BTW, dear OP, Four Leaf Clover is the single best shotgun perk and one of the best overall perks. Each pellet you shoot has a chance to fill your critical bar, with multiple pellets, shoot once, fill the crit bar full. Every 2nd shot of yours should be a critical
---
I just wish they would completely rework the UI at that point. So much space wasted to display so little info, the keybindings are awkward and all over the place, mouse navigation is garbage...
---
Awful lot of folks on my friends list show up online as playing Borderlands 3.
---
Going to get worse when Outer Worlds drops in a few weeks.
---
Booooooo
---
I enjoy it more than *Its Grafton day... again...*
---
When me and my buddy first picked up the game, we made it somewhere around lvl 20 before we ended up trying to get ammo from this one camp, owned by a level 130 and an 80. They ended up dropping us a bunch of stuff, and my friend accidentally shot one of them, we obviously got blasted to hell and back, but we couldn‚Äôt leave them thinking we weren‚Äôt appreciative! We ran back and did the ol heart emote. Ended up inviting them to a party and they helped us build our first camps, get our first legendaries, get to level fifty, and so on. Still good friends to this day
---
Goodbye fella
---
Non-killing PvP and more PvE content, solo or non-solo mode always sound great for non-PK players.
---
\+1
---
My problem is dumping stuff I really don't need. Everything from chems to scrap,as well as guns I don't use.I'm sure when I level up to 50 my carry weight will increase. I am more focused on obtaining caps right now to support my fast travel expenses so I'm starting to dump stuff of at the vendor.
---
Any area that contains Mutated fern (Flash fern) will yield raw violet flux when nuked. Harper‚Äôs Ferry is also a good spot. 
---
Flash fern tends to be found at the base of trees, so look for groves of pine trees (in the Cranberry Bog near fissure prime is a good spot) and check the ground around them.
---
There's a Mothman Cultist faction in Wastelanders so we might find out more. Currently it's unclear whether pre-war the followers were just mental but then moths got that post-nuclear re-up or if the Mothman was genuinely about before the bombs, I'm hoping for some clarification.
---
You have to click on the big roaster with a bear on it in the middle. During the event. And there is a 5 piece minimum.
---
Is it a one for one?
---
I played last night with 3 people on my server, I owned all the workshops, left them open so players could take what they wanted even went as far as inviting them to team up, but they were all low level and I think scared, plus with players taking advantage of teaming up and messing with players camps makes it hard to team up now a days.
---
Yeah. But you can put 15 on each event.
---
Your ellipsis is too long
---
I tried getting back into the game but I keep getting a crash/error code
---
I really do think that Outer worlds will be the straw that breaks the camels back for FO76. I've been bored playing it for a while now and have gone onto Metro Exodus for the time being. I'm sure ill be into it again when Wastelanders drops but once Outer Worlds releases i can't see me wanting to play anything else - it looks brilliant
---
Apart from the skin did the Gauss do anything special? Or was it just another Black Diamond/Perfect Storm/useless quest legendary?
---
I saw that guy when I started to play by luck and I almost shet myself.
---
One of these days I'll get to experience this...one day...
---
Glad to have you on board Initiate!
---
i have not! any guides on where to start the scout challenges?
---
Magazines are a bit different. They can spawn in the same place on different servers even if you collect one. I was server hopping recently for an unrelated reason and found one magazine spot spawned several times in an hour.
---
How will a perk loadout system help with crafting? Who has enough INT for all weapon and armour repair and upgrade perks? Plus even Chemist? 
---
It will be great if your SPECIAL points can handle different types of builds but I don't see how it will help the normal person.
---
I've been to a couple now that have failed but I still show up and just dump the crap prizes. Got the tenderizer and all the mods, but since getting them haven't hit it again
---
i just wish the display shelves didnt take stash and camp budget :(
---
I am sure they Bethesda will monetize inventory management in the future. Just be ready to fork out more cash for conveniences that should be part of game's design.
---
Have fun in the capital wasteland!
---
Nixie Tube clock from the Atomic Shop fills this void for me.
---
Level 250ish here.  I try to log in for at least a few minutes every day. I usually log in only to realize I'm going to be bored as hell and log off.
---
 I am currently playing borderlands 3 for the most part and patiently waiting The Outer Worlds.
---
Im expecting delays on Wastelanders. I personally think it wont be released until after the new year.
---
Once that drops Im sure I'll come back to 76.
---
Happens to me on ps4 all the time. Fuckin annoying
---
Better have fun replacing the icky, painful second degree burns' gauze every day.
---
I‚Äôve only seen the monster a couple of times and it disappears before I can draw my gun and turn towards it
---
[Here ya go](https://youtu.be/2AH1AWUz1sg)
---
Dude are you okay?
---
When you're done with him, send him north to the coal region. Looks eerily similar to Welch.
---
U do its workshops?
---
That would mean id need to have 1 very specific weapon to counter every build, kinda takes the fun out of it for me
---
Thank you all.
---
I've said it a million times every time this post comes up... We need the key ring from FO3...
---
First world problems, eh? I mean yeah - other's have encountered bugs where they lost all their gear or had their character deleted. I just wanted to vent and commiserate about this (relatively) insignificant bug. Anyway, thanks for taking the time to respond.
---
We did that kind of damage with the old TSE shotguns, didn't exactly drop dead in 3 secs.
---
Also no video killing her in 3secs like the muppet below me postulated, obviously..
---
You need better inventory management. You shouldn't ever need all that stuff...
---
Loved that DLC once I realized the Auto Axe was OP. By realized I mean watching MATN videos.
---
HahahahHahah. 
---
That makes you a necrophile - best wash your dick off lest it rot off you weirdo
---
We farm Washout on expert  and when I recorded we had about 2:15 when exiting the seed bank. In this attempt we didn't even find all the pump codes  but still had around one minute at the end of the raid (We are only 3 people btw not even full team)
---
[https://youtu.be/wzaV32EVEJQ](https://youtu.be/wzaV32EVEJQ)
---
The game just kept making itself hard to stick up for, and I stopped having fun.  Just moved, so I haven‚Äôt had internet for a minute, probably going to hop back on once I‚Äôm set up to play from a fresher perspective.
---
Did this a while back with my SO. We made new characters and started with nothing, each hit a Nukashine outside the vault, and had to race back to the vault from wherever we woke up whilst gathering as many of the listed items along the way. It was a good time.
---
Yes let's make another mode to waste development time and have it fail again!  
---
The majority of players obviously don't care about PVP. 
---
The PvP mode you had failed and was pulled. NW can barely get 30 players in a match. Very few people want to pvp. Not enough to waste development time on a new mode.
---
If you're only lv 30 it's likely you're no good at inventory management and you have a bunch of stuff you wont ever use that you should sell. Stop keeping everything. Bulking also won't help your weight except for aluminum and steel, you're just throwing away plastic. Only bulk to sell to a vendor. Look through your stash and pull out all the things you have over 100 quantity that don't bulk and sell those too.
---
There is a post where there is simply no need for an answer from the CM because it would not solve anything. They review, read, and if necessary answer and if not, they only collect the data in it and collect it for the appropriate department.
---
And I think there is no need that every time we put a bug they say "we already know" or "we are fixing it".
---
That then the appropriate department does not make the appropriate tests or fix easy things that have been communicated to them almost a year ago is another ... "bug" XD
---
And believe me, I am perhaps the one who complains the most and who possibly has the longest list of errors in the community (and I am not even the one who has collected the most or reported or far) ... but you have to stick to the reality.
---
Same with PC. I started BL3 and have noticed some of the people I know from 76 show playing BL3 and the like. I hope they can attract new players and I will still play from time to time, but at the moment I been elsewhere.
---
Chally. End of discussion.
---
Watch out for the Amish Raiders!
---
Congrats on holding off on the initial purchase. I haven't bought a game within a year of release in ages. It let's the company fix its games and you can get it cheaper. (76 was a gift). 
---
You could buy now if you want a feel of the original 76.  It's better than original release, but not perfect.  A $30 game, maybe up to $40.  
---
But really, I'd wait until Christmas. Wastelanders expansion is coming out, I'm thinking early Nov, and then there's be a month for them to fix whatever bugs it will introduce.  Plus, someone else can buy it for you as a present ;)
---
Agree!
---
Also having a separate "wallet" tab would be even better to store all your access/ID cards
---
-_-
---
Bethesda had a free play week on Xbox a while ago. That‚Äôs when I tried the game and for the first couple of days was completely lost because there was not a very good intro tutorial which just let me frustrated with the game, but I stuck with it and enjoyed the game enough to buy it for the bargain price of ¬£30 :-). If I only had a weekend to play and judge the game them I don‚Äôt think I would have bought it tbh
---
I did that too because of the nuka cola machine in FO3
---
You're ignoring them actually
---
Make it to Amish country, find out that everyone there looks like Point Pleasant DLC.
---
Yes its what we need to get pwned into the dirt for PC in NW mode by cheaters for the weekend.
---
It was an AIDs joke.
---
Thank you,i've found a game for 17 euros and i think it cant get any lower than that.
---
Username checks out.
---

---
I'm not sure this is the same issue but I've noticed that while doing the cookout event I'll will sometimes have my game start stuttering pretty bad. It'll freeze for a couple seconds about every 5 seconds. It makes the game almost unplayable but so far it's always fixed by logging out and back in
---
I totaly agree üëç
---
Just wanted to chime in - been doing Washout every night all week on PS4 and not had any inventory wipe issues.
---
there are lots of other games out there but i think people will come back for wastelanders
---
I‚Äôm lvl 390 and people still show up trying to do this. I always check if the silo is occupied, I go elsewhere. If they show up while I‚Äôm running it I do nothing at that point usually just leave or wait till they get bored and leave. But I feel ya, it sucks.
---
Doesnt need it.
---
GG we completed it yesterday about a 30+ tries. It's all about pump codes.
---
Just riot gear friend, NCR doesn't exist yet.
---
Can‚Äôt really ignore a scorchbeast. They‚Äôve got a real ‚ÄúInyoface‚Äù attitude about them.
---
They are just "studying it", just as they are "studying" the possibility of something to exchange ammunition, rejoin the server and other things announced at the beginning of the year and that we will not see with luck until next year ... so for Now, it is soon to know but the logical thing is that they will enable it for all platforms unless there is some own console regulations that make it difficult.
---
Although good, the logic is not that it can be applied much to the development of this game ...
---
Why is it needed on PC but not console? Genuine question, like I said I don't really play MMOs and I'm a console user so I'm a bit in the dark here
---
I think they should at least give us a sneak peek at the legendary perks
---
No juyst accept that pvp is part of the game. Sick of people ruining the pvp aspect of the game, and calling PvPers griefers or raiders, we aren't we like killing people in PvP and the challenge of fighting other humans just as the wasteland would be irl, it wouldn't all be rebuidling and singing kum bye ya round a camp fire, I prefer the challenge of the most dangerous game, Man. 
---
Sorry if that ruins your farming sim fallout experience, don't hit back, i would say don't take workshops, but thats not fair, take em all you want but just understand the risk. I was a low level once too and I knew the drill with workshops, its why I am half decent with PvP now, because I didn't just stand around waiting to get slotted, I worked on my build, paid my dews bought my god roll armour and weapons from the caps and items I earned, and GOT GOOD.
---
Expansion time!
---
congratz! Yea it's better to find all codes as soon as possible to have more time later on
---
try to milk gamers? noones forcing you to buy anything..every game company does it..bethesda have to make a living/pay staff/overheads/costs etc ? and can't survive off people paying once and execting everything else for free ...blizzard charges 8.99/month just to play and has cosmetics on top of this..so stop whining about it or just stop playing and go play something else.
---
 The Great *Cornholio!*
---
That was really damn cool.
---
Totally understand about dose keys!
---
[PS4] I‚Äôve said the same thing after meat week started. I server hopped for 3 days looking for players with actual * armor in their vending but kept finding only low lvl‚Äôs with clothing and not *armor. I seen a few ppl say they would be back after meat week, it was causing lag and crashes when you drop a nuke while MW is going simultaneously. I thought that was it. Glad it‚Äôs not just me going crazy from grinding.
---
Yeah I guess maybe I was quick to jump to conclusions but I'd say it's a solid bet it'll be implemented at some point next year. But just saying when they mentioned it in the ITV iirc it specifically said 'for PC'.
---
First you judge my camp, then you judge my sexual preferences lol. 
---
And I know you read my comment from yesterday, you just couldn‚Äôt understand it. 
---
Stay in school, little guy. Maybe someday you will understand
---
oh I didnt even think of that. I was so confused about what was going on with the pink glowing turrets and the pink glowing super mutants I never thought of that :)
---
outer worlds is a 40/50 hour experience..you'll be back.
---
Yep, ps4 player. I deleted F076 from my harddrive. Bethesda has turned another fan away from their series because of their shit show of a game. This is worse the ESO.
---
Or maybe some mob blew your stuff and the players killed it.
---
You get the prime meat &amp; hand it in at the big stew pot during his hourly event
---
Game lists them under WORLD section of challenges if I remember correctly, and there are 9 initial challenges followed by I think 12-15 more? but they are super varied and fun, they take you all around the map and you get to buy stuff with each challenge done as they reward a special kind of currency my man. One of the things you can buy is a backpack which increases carrying capacity by a whopping 60 points!
---
How did I miss that nooo
---
Sounds great dude.
---
If you get time check out the wanted mission at the penitentiary
---
I still carry my TSE pump to cripple the SBQ and others but I have really switched to my AAE and TSE handmades now. They are so much better in the long run. Its sad how the DEV just go to extremes when the apply NERFs in a game...
---
I do, I just dont get it??? I have tried it multiple times now and I just dont understand. I dont care about the flag, dont care about the stupid oversized tenderizer...Ill take the XP from the event but other than that Ill pass...
---
It's too late, you're turning into a ghoul.
---
Just get a fedora, a trenchcoat, and accept it.
---
huh, never paid attention to camp spots. One thing might be the Meat Week's convenient camp spots as I see similar placed camps all around the map nowadays, but yeah game needs something before wastelanders otherwise I'd wager its gonna be a little empty for this next couple of weeks.
---
for your fridge I assume?
---
On PC we cannot even send private text messages between users, on consoles we can.
---
That and that in PC it is more common to have a keyboard ... while in consoles it is more common to have headphones with a microphone.
---
BGS really needs to address this, it is such an asshat move and can be stopped so easily!
---
That's really cute although I don't know about you but I hate the freaking barn set windows.. I wish there was an option with normal windows.
---
You guys playing on PC? I'm in need of some fallout friends and I love building.
---
but of course it would also count towards our stash space and camp budget and I would have to sacrifice more important camp items just to do that. They need to fix it so we can use display space without having to trash our walls and other camp items just to do that.....
---
Can I have a pet liberator?
---
Might be a bit clunky, but I know the console version of Warframe has a text box, so it can work.
---
Fair enough, I guess it's more that I'd like a server-wide chat log, one that everyone will see rather than just individually messaging people on the whim they *might* have that exact bit of gear you're after. Could be handled through those Personal Terminals?
---
I have had all kinds of things that I killed up to an hour previous just fall out of the sky after I fast traveled half away across the map. It was kind of funny actually. Im not sure if the other players saw it in their game or not? I traveled back to White Springs Station from Watoga and 4 or 5 SB fell and so did the Hermit Crab bus, all at the same time...
---
On PS4 there‚Äôs a team that drops 3 one after the other then server hops and repeats. It makes it with it but drains the ammo quickly.
---
Everything is welcome in the shelter :)
---
Fi guy ft 3 xavi dfi t ft fr a ft.

Didn‚Äôt bother reading this reply
---
I dont have any toons that low but if you want to add me I would love to have someone to play with on the PC side... IGN JanynFletcher
---
That‚Äôs great when they all fall at once. At first it freaked me out but it happens so often now I just roll on.
---
And the point is? This isnt a mmo lol
---
Hes talking about real life Pennsylvania just google it.
---
Yeah like even Rocket League has one haha
---
I know some people have those controller keyboards as well, I'm just after something where we send out a message such as 'Launching SBQ in 5' or 'Wtb T-51b Cal Shocks' etc
---
yep there is a cool down period of 3 hours...
---
I am a level 86. I have been scavenging and avoiding missions and fighting for the most part. Been playing since beta, and I am still on the fire breathers mission. I think I still have plenty of fun to be had. Since I became a vendor it has helped me with my scavenging playstyle. Been a lot of fun too. I am a Raider tho, I had a 3 man group of all level 100s and 200s trolls try destroying my camp, they met my vampire gatlin and only I walked away. The 50 caps per kill made it worth my time and the hassle of rebuilding a few walls.
---
That is correct, there are a few snap tails in the stream and half of them are bugged so you cant even harvest them. That is it for the entire area..WS is not a great area for Violet flux....
---
Its not that they ned a buff. We need places to spawn more. Like i want to nuke something in the bog and it literally be only Death Claws. You wont think Death Claws need a buff anymore when theres 10 or so Chameleon Death Claws roaming around. 
---
Serious?! Where is the army of Assaultrons?! 
---
Imagine whitesprings ghouls but different enemies.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox and want to launch a nuke I have keycards and enough ammo to run it with you.
---
For everyone shitting on the op, a home brew shotgun doesn't have to work like a regular gun.
---
Think of it like this, you need a weapon that can deal huge damage in a short time and a shotgun won't cut it.
---
So you build a crude pipe gun that holds 4 shells in 4 barrels, and when you pull the trigger it fires all 4 at once.
---
Hugely inefficient, probably very heavy and will break quick, but massive damage. This is what I think they missed out on with pipe weapons, they tried to make them work like regular guns. But we have plenty of real guns. 
---
Same with the bolt action, should have been .50cal by default, basicly meaning you would have a way to shoot .50cal very early in the game.
---
dont know why your getting downvoted. but this is completely true.
---
I know this post is old but since the map has been so helpful to me I wanted to add some spawn points I found:
---
1. Delta code can spawn in the Delta Pump room just to the right of the door.
---
2. Delta code can spawn in Gamma Pump room just to the left of the door (on the metal shelf).
---
Probably not unless you entered PVP with someone...Monsters will attack while you are away from it. If your defenses are down it is free game then...A notification system would be nice to alert us when we are away that this is happening.
---
Lemme try a different way of explaining.
---
Someone wants help launching their first nuke, so they send out a server-wide message saying 'Level 40 need help for silo+SBQ' or maybe someone needs a single Hardened Mass before their flux expires so they send out a callout for one of those.
---
Faster and less tedious than going back n forth to Reddit (if the player even has Reddit) and keeps it in-game. If it's done through the Personal Terminals it even keeps 'immersion'.
---
Facts
---
Ohio! Atleast we're not Indiana!
---
The game couldn‚Äôt handle it unfortunately.
---
The AS would make a killing on pet skins.
---
I always reset my items back to their original names before I Sell them.
---
Oh my god lol. I‚Äòve been responding to the wrong sub the entire time üòÇüòÇ. Now I feel kind of stupid hahah. My bad man thought I was in the borderlands sub.
---
How long were marinating that?
---
events help a lot, White springs golf club is a great place to get a lot in one run. Do the buildings along the side of it as well. Do Watoga with the robots, you will level very quickly. Make sure you rest prior as well to get the extra 5%
---
Yep. Would be awesome to have a better way to organize and clean up the stash. At the moment I am trying to get rid of 20 of 800 to move on... Every couple of hours.
---
2 shot doubles the chance to proc as well does the explosive. it counts as 4 times with twoshot explosive. 
---
limb damage is pointless since you can oneshot most stuff in this game. if you are thinking about cripling wings for the queen.  just shoot at her wings not extra steps need it since you will instante criple her. ..
---
2 nd   grenadier is not worth it. the radius is already small and using grenadier dosent do anything to it . already tested it.
---
I feel like that dude in the Matrix...the Key Master. I got so many freaking keys!
---
Over priced and most of it is completely useless. I would spend more if they had skins and paint for the items most of us actually have and use!
---
I know I recently moved on. Love 76 and the other FO games I played, but so many glaring issues with mechanics while they try to sell me more skins. And the camp skins are the best ones of all. Make a comic book shelf and 4 walls and you are done. I know this is an exaggeration but you get the idea. Might revisit for Wastelanders, but I sure hope they start prioritizing game quality over skin quantity soon. 
---
You can only make your customer feel like a mindless cash cow for so long.

Greetings from the land where cunnilingus is illegal, you‚Äôre legally required to have windshield wipers on your car but not a windshield, and selling a hollow log is a death penalty offense.

---
Yeah I get this and the air drop crates
---
The soloing hurts, mostly because I missed meat week the first time lol
---
Correct, it was added 2 months after my comment.
---
So was skyrim and fallout, and more people are playing that than fallout, at least on xbox
---
Yea I deuced out for borderlands 3, wasn‚Äôt having fun unless I was playing with a friend. Bl3 isn‚Äôt like that. Shits over the top and fun all the time.
---
Hey now, we can both agree we're at least not Michigan
---
One trip through lucky hole with escalator suit will land you quite a bit.
---
Ps4? If so I have a camp near an event. Just do 5% damage each Yogi Bear and no need to waste all your ammo saving my picinik basket.
---
Thanks üëçüèª
---
The stash system in 76 really grates with my fiance's OCD. In 4 we have different boxes/containers for different things and everything has it's own place. Raw meat went in one fridge, cooked food went in another fridge, packaged food went in the metal wall cabinet and raw vegetables went in a lunch pail. Our drinks would be stored in a different fridge. All of these went in the kitchen (obviously).
---
I completely agree with you!  I did the event so many times over the weekend, and only once (around 1 am), was it not packed.  I haven't been doing the Prime Cut events, just the cookouts.  There are 2 plans I'm still missing, so hopefully I'll get them before the event ends.  But I enjoy doing the event, and really enjoy the game.  I'm level 250 and have completed all the quests, done all of the events at lease once, and I still enjoy playing the game.  I enjoy just wandering around and finding things I've missed, helping others when I can, and doing events over again just because I enjoy them.
---
Lol wow
---
I think.. your build may be broken.
---
I can definitely say that if you are not dealing a ton of damage you are not going to get any loot. I am level 166 now and out the last 18 SBQ runs I have done, when I just used my TSE shotgun I got no loot at all with the other heavy hitters there. But when I use my Ultracite Explosive Mini-Gun on her I got loot every time. It definitely depends on the team that is there with you and how much damage you are doing. So it really doesnt matter about your level so much, it is more about your build, your weapon and how much DPS you are doing in the end. All of us should be looking out for each other. Even I will try to clear the adds from others when I see them so we can stay focused on the SBQ. I think it is silly to say if "you are 50 or lower" you cant play....
---
I have done it now, 88 times in the last 3 weeks and 45 of those times I got nothing from the boxes. So something is going on.....
---
Wait how do I find such a great build?
---
Text chat is fine as long as it can be toggled off.  Most of the time, I would not want more crap on my screen.
---
**MITTEN SQUAD WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION**
---
You are not doing ENOUGH DPS to get the loot....
---
Ya
---
Still enjoy the game, but I'm splitting some time to BL3. BL isn't my thing - a bit too much leaning towards Destiny and a bit too much of the silly loot-shop-shoot cycle that makes it feel like a FB or mobile game.
---
Outer Worlds though ... that's going to eat time.
---
It's well done, I'm just burnt out on it....
---
Good for XP and some materials like Acid.
---
Well-done, both of you.
---
Shotguns desperately need a buff! Absolutely nobody is using them rn and i can see why...
---
Sleep helps
---
Oh yeah absolutely, it causes me physical pain when I team up with someone and half the screen is covered with the all the quests they have active
---
I'm still a bit astonished on how long they've been delaying such a basic feature as text chat by now...
---
Want us to group up and play the game (officially, inofficially we should probably only login in, buy all the Atoms and vanish again...) without giving us any way of basic communication except some makeshit voice-chat
---
Compared to how a modder was able to provide one mere weeks after launch one year ago....Simply lazy development and incompetence at Bethesda's side
---
Lmao no worries bud
---
Done! Adding now new friend!
---
Institute confirmed for wastelanders?
---
Bethesda: Here have some more raider Atom shop things
---
Think I added you, not used to this via PC :/ sorry!
---
I thought it was just me, even after boosting my dr to 400 and 450 in pa i feel like i'm taking more damage than I used too
---
oh no worry, I will check tonight and accept :) I the friends list is very buggy
---
Haha! Western PA is *exactly* like that. Place creeps me the fuck out.
---
yeah it was very easy actually
---
And Radants!...lol
---
It‚Äôs an all right event. It‚Äôs not as good as Fasnacht, but it‚Äôs enjoyable. My only true complaint is that the rewards kinda suck, the Tenderizer being the only actually cool thing. The Fasnacht masks were really unique pieces of apparel and that made then fun and cool things to collect, meanwhile Meat Week really only has the Tenderizer and a couple of reskinned chef‚Äôs outfits.
---
You know you can server hop lucky hole, right? All the ore respawns. You can easily get about 2000+ lead ore in an hour.
---
Only problem is, that there is nothing to do in this game after like 600 hours. Which is good, but game is out for long time. Also bethesda did most of new content to increase profit. Not to keep veterans playing. 
---
Also this community is weird in some way, because you guys are requesting really stupid things. Like deep story, npc and companions to MMO game. What the f\*ck? :D 
---
At beta i had feeling this will be something like world of warcraft, but now i know it will die like borderlands 2.
---
Oh okay, good to know it‚Äôs not just me! Can‚Äôt wait to hunt some scorched with you!
---
Thats a deal! :)
---
it is
---
I wouldnt say item rewards are TOTALLY useless... they fetch a pretty penny from players who don‚Äôt want to play/missed Meat Week.
---
Maybe they feel its more valuable so they put it in misc so you dont drop it on death
---
Once out of the map can you walk the other side of the invisible wall across the whole map?
---
Agreed, if only because shelves are basically useless without this function. Who the heck wants to build a completely empty and pointless shelf in their house? It just looks weird.
---
Id say wait until we get a big update (wastelanders) so it will generate hype
---
It will only hold a max of 2 in its reservoir. Rate of production is 12. Therefore one needs to visit it 6 times in order to get the max rate.
---
I wonder if a solution to this could be tackled a different way. If I was a dev, I'd try applying filters to certain containers so that they only displayed a certain class of items in your stash by default.
---
Blue Knob mountain, Susquehanna river
---
I‚Äôm Mrkool27 btw
---
It‚Äôs normal, people are playing Gears, Borderlands, etc.....
---
Bugs don‚Äôt help too, they‚Äôre very annoying and it seems they won‚Äôt get fixed until Q2 2022.
---
Anyway, player base should increase with Wastelanders release, provided it‚Äôs not a bug fest.
---
Yea I'm starting to recognize players that I've never even talked to before, just by the fact I've seen their names several times before. This was especially true on survival, but that'll be gone soon so whatever.
---
I eat ALL the cheese
---
Amazing idea !! Hope something like this will get implemented  !
---
You can even link to /u/BethesdaReplied and see all of your team's post histories in one account.
---
Maybe depends on when you play? I play, primarily, "primetime" between 8 and 10 pm central, and early early morning (4-5am), occasionally afternoons 5 -7ish. I find the afternoons and primetimes are usually pretty populated, while I don't even see outside-US presense much morning time. Granted, there is still always someone on morningtime.
---
If it disappeared it wasn't one you could have killed anyway. There's two version of the Flatwoods Monster that spawns. One disappears after becoming aware of  you, the other actually will stay and fight you. The disappearing version spawns in low level areas (Forest, Toxic Valley, Ash Heap) while the one you can fight spawns in high level areas (Savage Divide, Mire, Cranberry Bog). The Mothman's the same way.
---
I read a short book about the Mothman when I was a kid and had nightmares for weeks.  It had this image of a family watching TV while a giant Mothman stared at them through a big bay window.
---
I had a camp for a time on a lead node north west of the munitions factory.  It had a nice view of the winding way, or whatever that place of tranquility is...  Only problem I had was getting attacked by a random SB once in a while
---
Get Ceano's reshade if you're on pc. Makes the nights nice and dark but when you're in the mire you will not see anything at all
---
I was on 3 different servers where someone put a camp next to the "Kill creatures" event and ruined the whole thing.
---
Yes, they look so out of place empty!
---
I agree with the clear buffing up of the mobs, I am taking more damage and more rads per hit from Ghouls and have seen the SM ballistic damage jump too, they track in on me quicker even in stealth mode since patch 13, and accuracy at range is greater I‚Äôm pretty sure.
---
Not to stir this up, but a side effect of this is I bought another 15 repair kits this weekend because I was seeing so much more rapid armor damage I couldn‚Äôt get through any kind of extended solo  battles with Scorch beasts etc.
---
I don‚Äôt imagine BGS isn‚Äôt happy as hell to see more people buying them, And I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm the only one doing it.
---
So is fallout 76 is my experience...
---
Yes, however you kinda crash the whole game
---
I found the plan for mines in the level 3 safe at harpers ferry,along with a couple other less common plans on different locations. I always pick a level 3 lock, never know what your gonna get.
---
&gt;silly loot-shop-shoot
---
You got me there, Fallout 76 is like that for me.
---
I wanna try it out
---
Yes with the quest markers. But you know, it's all ok. One of the BSG mods just assured me they read all these post, even if they don't write anything, so I'm sure a fix is on the way /s/s/s.
---
I stopped playing for a bit. The events I used to enjoy like Arktos can‚Äôt be triggered anymore and generally there‚Äôs not really anything else I can do on there.
---
Yes. I linked jump to lb because it's easier for me. I think I'm backing out of vats and jumping, but I end up in my pip-boy placing my camp.
---
Yup I noticed hardly anyone is participating sucks
---
I was playing last night and noticed I had a entire server space to myself.  It was an odd feeling....
---
Its hit or miss to be honest (Xbox). Be mindful if you have a full server because I joined a couple of the primal cuts events and got my ass handed to me. Then went give a helping hand at ole grahams for the cookout and dont you know its just me and two other folks. I then browse the map and its only me and those two people on the server.
---
Huh, good to know.
---
I hate Yao Gui. Their stagger is just a bit too much. I'd rather them hit faster, and have less than a 100% chance to stagger me. By the time I'm out of stagger, they're hittin me again. They need to give this effect to Deathclaws, which are a joke in this game.
---
I've come back for Meat Week, but I'm taking a break until Wastelanders. 
---
Not that I hate the game or im level 300 and bored or anything, I've still got loads to do. I just wanted to give it a break so I don't get burnt out on it by time Wastelanders turns up
---
I‚Äôve seen some camps that have, what I assume is, a pacified animal hanging around. Any idea how that‚Äôs done?
---
"Like deep story, npc and companions to MMO game. What the f*ck? :D "
---
You mean they want a fallout experience in their fallout game .. what? nooooooo, lol.
---
Have fun killing Arthur again
---
&gt; atomic acorns
---
Yes please
---
 daily quest requiring mirelurk meat, gulper innards etc is constantly bugged showing its stages are done while they are not 
---
Which quest is this? I have a lot of hours in this game and someone missed this?
---
I might be wrong but it might not be good to max them all out, I have my perk cards exactly were I want them. I have all the cards for weight reduction when exploring, and i have all the one for fighting. If i max them out I wouldn't be able to equip the ones I want. Plus with weight reduction u max out at 80 or 90% . A lot to consider depends on the build ur going for.
---
I put my camp out of bounds on the forest right west of the map when the camera fly glitch was a thing.
---
Next month in fallout 76, adopt a pet week!
---
Whoever down voted you is dumb (it was at 0 at the time of comment) .. have a up vote to highlight the issue you're facing trying to play the game.
---
Okay fair point, well for my personal use they‚Äôre useless :p
---
Bethesda: "we do not agree."
---
Yeah. Being a martyr isn‚Äôt on my list today. Maybe.  But I don‚Äôt feel like being downvoted into the shadow realm. Because I‚Äôm taking people‚Äôs lightning.
---
I have over 150, I sell them and when u buy them it will trigger the event. I have been there with all of them and only one was taken out. If I want to trigger the event I grab one out of a player vendor or go to the bunker.
---
Is the gatling laser better than the gatling plasma? I don't know much about guns but I'm looking for a heavy gun for the SBQ fight.
---
Yeah, I know. I get that, but I was expecting something little different. Something more than The sims 76. Anyway i look forward for that new DLC, gonna check it as it come live.
---
Messenger broke/healed in Ash Heap. Collect Honey Quest (seen for first time) not froze up after first wave. Oh well.
---
Release Wastelanders and make NW f2p.
---
Yeah no PvP and I‚Äôm set to pacifist so I don‚Äôt get flagged during events.
---
The whole thing is just weird ..... had to be the rare SB that come by.  I noticed my vending was off and travelled back and there was like nothing left lol.
---
Oh man ... yeah FO4 had an alert system for settlements it would be nice if it could alert you some way but it would probably get annoying.
---
Maybe something like 3 out of 10 defense down or something.
---
What a coincidence, I am also looking for people to play with as my only friend that I ever play with is too busy lately
---
I might be taking this wrong ur comment and if I am sorry ahead of time. I'm not one to spend hard earned atoms and get very little in return, all I ask is that we get skins that apply to all our weapons, kinda like armor, u dont just get a skin for a chest plate u get it for the entire armor set. Again sorry ahead of time if misunderstanding ur comment
---
Hey, I live in western PA
---
Woot! Well.. Sorry to hear about your other friend, but woot! New friend! Add me or give me your IGN and I‚Äôll add you!
---
You would think Beth could cook up something new rather than using the same event they just used.
---
Whoopsies
---
I‚Äôm with you, don‚Äôt know this one.
---
I have a Bloodied Explosive combat shotgun and never take it out except for novelty. All of my other bloodied gear just outmatches it generally, the range is abysmal. Range buff and something to help armor pen would go a long way
---
Can you beat fallout 76 in Pennsylvania
---
Very good!
---
Shotguns are fine, other weapons are too strong.
---
And still, with enforcer equipped I can cripple entire mobs that include death claws.
---
It all dependes on the eye of the observer I guess.
---
So you want skins like from fallout 4 creation club?
---
It's pretty crappy. I wouldn't say skins should fit every weapon, but at least a few.
---
I have noticed a lot less players showing up. Prizes suck. Maybe get better prizes or double xp if event is completed.
---
That‚Äôs the psycho robot (I know, which one?) chloe in Berkeley springs.  She sometimes requires you to get meat, that can spoil or be consumed/cooked.
---
Yup, I‚Äôm saving any extra plans and mods as well as tenderizers to sell after the event.
---
The three events that can reward possum badges needs to reward them 100% of the time, not ~25% like it is right now.
---
There's just nothing I want from it.
---
So I bought camo skins for my rifle and my combat armor and would like to camo up my shot gun and other weapons. I feel that is simple, as for fallout 4 skins not sure dont think I have ever used them
---
I would like a shared stash for the account.
---
To address the performance problem this could be a remote but much slower stash.
---
An ideal implementation would be a character management screen which only interacts with the main account storage and we can move items between characters without having to load into a world.
---
Manage inventory, special stats, achievements, etc.
---
Yeah right u work hard for those atoms and want ur money's worth
---
Borderlands 2 is 7 years old and still sees some online activity, i really doubt the remaining fo76 players will keep playing a year or two from now, if bethesda even keeps the server online for that long.
---
Bethesda NERF the stupid op weapons and perks!
---
IMO but that‚Äôs what I think.
---
I have 5 small ones i keep at my camp but keep them unlocked so other players can help themselves
---
Bad take.
---
The enemies are bullet sponges. To be able to play any of the endgame content you need good legendaries. That isn't even a question. The legendaries we have now are just barely good enough. 
---
If we nerfed everything to shotgun level, it would take hours of dying to clear a nuke whitesprings at the highest levels. 
---
If they nerf everything to shotgun level, it would also take a MASSIVE nerf of literally every enemy in the game to allow us to have viable endgame content or to have any reward for leveling up.
---
Glowing Ones shouldn't each be mini bosses. An endgame weapon should 1-2 shot them. Shotguns take nearly 8 shots to kill one sometimes more.
---
I'm currently taking a break from this game. Ever since they announced that they were removing survival mode. I just can't get back into adventure mode, it's just not the same without bloodthirsty hunters. Too bummed for meat week even. 
---
I'll be back to check out wastelanders. But if they don't bring back the unstructured PVP that survival mode had I doubt I'll stick around.
---
Do you have some of the materials in your stash and some on your character? Because that can sometimes cause issues with crafting. Make sure everything is in one place or the other.
---
If they sold 1 skin they would make $$ once but not again witch aint fair to them
---

I agree. Need more skins for armor and weapons, and they should apply to all sets.
---
Awwww.   Tough boys are so cute.
---
The only working endgame content we have is nuke zones. The only really lucrative place to nuke is whitesprings. That creates about 100 glowing ones. The golf course alone has about 30. 
---
If your only late mid-endgame content is always still a struggle the game just isn't worth playing. Theres no reward.
---
The basic filler enemy should basically never be 8 shots to kill by the strongest people. It's been like this since ttrpgs in the 70s.
---
If you play dnd, do you wanna be level 20 with spells as strong as nukes and a flaming sword and still struggle to fight 3 goblins?
---
&gt; I want that 50% sale.
---
My 700+ scrip is waiting for that sale. cant wait to be over-encumbered due to all the legendary weapons I cant scrap into scrip due to the 150 scrip per day limit
---
If its anything like New Vegas, its going to require at least 3-5 playthroughs
---
What we ate getting a load out for perks, I'm so effin excited now can not wait. PC has had a mod. Perfect thanks for the info I really need to read those
---
A non feral ghoul npc that sells pets, pet clothes, pet food. 
---
He's grown to love animals cos they don't judge him based on his appearance and is hiding out in an old free states bunker for fear that the wadtelanders will kill him on sight thinking he's a feral.
---
They can still nuke your camp and destroy it.
---
I would due it more if I knew that the Tenderizer had a blueprint instead of the weapon itself
---
Dude just finish the damn thing... lvl 86 and can lauch nukes...
---
There‚Äôs no need to, you‚Äôre the only one who can see the custom name.
---
I just meant that you (and everyone else on this sub, if included) might want and expect that we should be able to apply it to all weapons. But if they did that, you'd need one really nice skin for every weapon and you've spend a lot less.
---
So Bethesda would probably not implement this idea because they'd profit less.
---
It‚Äôs fun when you‚Äôre not stuck doing the event alone. Primal Cuts is handy for farming scrap and the occasional legendary doesn‚Äôt hurt either. Wouldn‚Äôt mind this being a semi-annual event. More than that would be too much.
---
Another thing I'd add (although i haven't seen any since meat week began) is with the horde events. They really need to make it so the horde boss cant be killed by other enemies. So many times I'll arrive and it'll instruct me to kill the horde boss, I'll run towards it just in time to see it being killed by a couple of radroaches.  Also the quest markers for this event can be incredibly confusing
---
I may or may not have a fresh mule waiting to be over encumbered outside the purveyors shop.
---
You also have to be double the animals level, so something to keep in mind
---
I've lived there. He's talking about the game though.
---
Nothing wrong with that just keep them on the frame and it only takes up 10lbs. I had all sets at one time and now I'm down to a full set of camo X01 with jet pack and a mixed set, ultracite legs, X01 stealth boy torso, excavator arms and X01 sensor helmet.
---
I have my controls mapped to the same as RDR2 so it's easier to switch back and forth between games (PS4 though) . I really  like vats on my RH joystick like deadeye in rdr.
---
So vaults would actually be beneficial. The heaviest resource sapping is done by bases. It would be hugely beneficial to have individually loaded underground vaults. You could also do a cave. Like you said you could also have a basement/door leading to underground. Cool idea. Don‚Äôt think it can be done now, though.
---
For the last 1000 hours I've been mostly doing nothing. It's quite similiar to how I've played a ton of F4, too.
---
&gt;lvl 86 and can lauch nukes...
---
sounds like the POTUS
---
Totally agree with everything except the emergency broadcast part. I don't think joining the enemy faction just for a moment to help move the tides to another side will fit the game. No faction would allow you to murder your allies for a while to help out the other side. Also, I think a lot of people would abuse the system to get on the other side and troll. How about emergency broadcast that would invite players of same faction from other servers to help out? Maybe that could work. There are also other ways to help out the outnumbered folks. In ESO, the side with less players gets a stats boost to give them a fighting chance. In Guild Wars 2 solution is even better, with NPC champions helping outnumbered players to gain some ground. In Fallout 76, maybe when some side is heavily outnumbered they can call for a stronger NPC air and ground support (robots, vertibirds, drones, stronger guards etc)
---
I didn‚Äôt even get a chance to participate in Meat Week last time cause the servers were so shitty and the game also needed an update so badly. They would appear on my map, I‚Äôd fast travel to it. And then nothing would be there. The event wouldn‚Äôt like activate or whatever. So it was just a total waste of caps and time for me. So needless to say, I‚Äôm not bothering with this one. Then again I‚Äôve kinda stopped playing the game all together. It‚Äôs disappointing.
---
What's SWG?
---
What was the question? I think I missed it.
---
I somehow ended up inside the enclave and kept pushing forward cause that damn monitor wouldn't stop talking making me want to finish whatever it was so I wouldn't have to hear him talk again lmao
---
I‚Äôve been playing games for decades and played competitive BF1942, BF:V back in the day and my take is.....
---
Stop building PVE games with PvP mini games.  The PvP aspect always bleeds back into PvE with nerfs and crap because they refuse to manage and develop separate code branches.
---
If you want to enjoy a PvP experience buy a game developed for PvP.
---
Not sure what the hell is wrong with some generations where they just have to shoot some other player in the face to make playing a game worthwhile.
---
Now I understand this game is a dystopian setting and we should all be competing for resources and stuff but the current state of PvP is lack luster and if they made it larger than the workshop zones then no one will play FO76.
---
There is too much focus on building and holding on to your stuff.
---
I don‚Äôt have the answer other than if you want to PvP then it has match maker and zones where you queue in like Destiny....but then you run in to players using PvE gear and there is always a meta which gets nerfed in the end.
---
One of my gaming buddies commented that:  
---
Objects you buy in the ATOM shop should take NO camp budget AT ALL.  BUT still have the limit as does turrets, lights, greenhouse dome. ect.    
---
THIS idea I would totaly accept.
---
Anyone else?
---
Oh I know what it was for when I bought it, just wish we could have more skins that's it or buy a group of skins.
---
I had not thought of it that way but it makes sense.
---
i constantly swap between 2  combat setups(normal combat/raid bug combat), med/ammo crafting setups, and hack/picklock setups (silo/raid), so the quick decks would help me.
---
That would be an alternative way... nerf the weapons and armor
---
Ah, I see. I've collected toys and met up with ghouls but never had to collect meat. I don't do it very often though.
---
I am wondering if anyone has any stories in game lately. And the second question is me pondering if those trolls were embarrassed. You missed not one but 2 questions technically.
---
Yeah right so we know it can be done. I really like the camo skins and have a stealth build so camo or all blacked out would be cool right?
---
I don't think so. Nothing would change really except some bots and vertibirds spawming here and there. There would be still the same number of players spread around the map capturing differnt objectives. The chance of everyone meeting at one place would be same as it is now or even lesser as there'd be lots of stuff to do everywhere.
---
Oh ok. It came off as if you thought that bethesda advertised it for everything but you couldn't put it on everything.
---
&gt;and want ur money's worth
---
They could charge 10K Atoms for a single skin, it's there choice from a business point of view, if a customer buys it and the description of the item was available, you have had your money's worth.
---
work around to the place the queen flies off the map when she's bored and give her a surprise.
---
Or work your way around the top and down the left side to visit the land of the cargobots.
---
Then spec to it? If you don't want to fight with a build of your own creation, pretty sure nuclear winter is a lot closer to what you are looking for.
---
I am not a PvPer and wary of some of those PvP bait scams I read about on here. 
---
Iirc, Friday night I had on my meat week hat and outfit bc I joined in the event a few times and happened to be in Flatwoods minding my own business and selling some junk to the vendor Bot. While I'm busy this level 4 dude comes up and tells me 3 times how bad he wants to shoot my face. (My guy is currently level 95) Psychopath much dude?
---
I dropped 3 salt for him on my way out and continued about my business doing dailies elsewhere. I'm guessing he was PvP bait, and I'd have been tempted to shoot him if I didn't know better.
---
I get that. Ive seriously wanted a kinda fight that feel like taking on a mirelurk queen at level 20 or like taking on a deathclaw at level 5. A really big intense fight you'll remember. You don't get that at later levels.
---
BUT i also think grunt enemies like Charred Ghouls, which currently take 6 shotgun shots with all the full perks shouldn't be as taxing to fight as they are with shotguns. The speed at which they can be killed currently with every other weapon is good.
---
I think the answer is add a couple really big fights that are real mini bosses you need to seek out and not to turn every encounter into a massive panic fight. I like the play with headphones and such in sometimes. I like to just walk around the mire and fight gulpers and stuff. I want to be able to do that, without feeling like I need 2000$ headphones and esports level reflexes to feel safe.
---
Congrats to you both. Im one of ur subscribers so will watch in a bit
---
I agree ur right. Then offer skins for all ur weapons. Not all weapons are represented and it seems like one skin on only one weapon. I would pay for it atoms are not that hard to earn
---
I think a blacked out paint would look really cool and be a good idea for power armour, guns and normal armour! Maybe even a camo that fits all.
---
nope not me. Stash limit is a huge burden for me and all of my gaming buddies.
---
I always collect a bunch of those bug parts, and just farm the one I need that day. For example one day I'll have everything besides bloatfly glands so I'll collect a bunch of those at once and store the rest. Next day it'll be stingwing barbs, so I'll collect a bunch of those. It keeps me from having to goto 5 areas everyday and instead only goto 1. Also there's a static radroach spawn in the cabin behind the one you turn in the parts in the room with the moleman mask, and ticks are always in the grass on the way.
---
Lmao I don't like pvp either the trolls followed me after taking over a worskhop I had trying to add me to their group the trolled from there unlocking all my locks. When I turned off pacify mode I think I shocked them.
---
I will from now on leave salt for trolls tho. That is some good shit right there and that is something I can appreciates about you.
---
Agree I really just want more choices on skins for all the weapons would u agree with that?
---
If i want to burry my home ill just put my home in a cave witch is something we need more of  ..
---
congrats, this is amazing!
---
LOL, the visual image is disturbing.
---
Might be the turrets
---
Agree mostly, but:
---
* Messenger not only stuck on burning fire, but also stuck in houses that has doors up the stairs - many times he can't get to doors in Harpers Ferry or Berkley, when there are high stars.
---
* I got bloodied/SS shovel always with me, but yes, this needs to be addressed.
---
* not only arktos should be taken out of Public events list - Campfire tales also have very low spawn rate.
---
* It's a trap is still bugged - one in the Bog, near NAR Trainyard is almost always bugged, one in the Mire is also bugged 8/10 tries (either by low time remaining to activate the lure or not spawning SB at all). Only working ones (most of the times) for me is one in the AshHeap, one in the middle of the bog and one on edge of ash heap and forest.
---
Does the vox syringer daily work for anyone?
---
Agree, I'm all for them making money dont get me wrong and I would buy them if they had the ones I want. But I agree with u
---
I agree. I got the Tricentennial edition and it came with a weapon/armour skin but the weapon skin can only be applied to the 10mm pistol and an axe (and maybe one more), and I use the PA skin on my T-45 but I just wish I could use that skin for all of my weapons bc I really like the blue and gold of it.
---
Everything is a give and take we all ask for things that we want in the game and for them it costs a bit to add features in hence why they charge a bit as its only fair.
---
Play Time have three versions - one with the toys, one with the flowers and this one with those items to collect.
---
Oh no, no worries my bad maybe my wording sorry thanks for the post
---
Wow, I stand corrected, I shall here forth cast away to oblivion my grammar na\*i bible and mend my ways.
---
I max at about 1200. I just wanted to test it. Its sad that you can carry more than you can store. Should be inverted to help the display builders.
---
Oh I‚Äôve done a bunch but it comes back. I‚Äôve turn it off as in I‚Äôm not interested but it comes back.
---
weapons scrapping.

---
Hi there, yes they are aware of this one! I don't have any recent updates yet unfortunately but it's being worked on.
---
I'm sure when they get private servers bethesda might loose money if they can add mods like this. Me personally I wont play on private server or with mods I want the trophy and rewards and actually really like the game the way it is and look forward to wastelanders. No doubt when private server come the regular servers will be empty we will see

 &gt; Hi there, yes they are aware of this one! I don't have any recent updates yet unfortunately but it's being worked on.
---
Same ill stay in the online area only fuck single player. Sorry to say but i highly dought bethesda will ever release another fallout like fallout 5 as it would be a huge profit loss to them.
---
Anecdotally, it feels like some enemies are tougher.  Like others have noted, that Super Mutant with the Assault Rifle seems to have the same kind of anti-armor effect that the Colonel Gutsys have.  And Mirelurk Kings have always sucked.
---
I find it tends to be quite extreme.  Either I'm waltzing into a battle and nothing touches me, or I go down almost immediately.  At first, I blamed it on perhaps not having full AP for Dodgy to proc, and that's probably a big part of it.  But there will be times when I just crumble and I'm not entirely sure why.
---
Or to the east and visit Raven Rock
---
Two days ago I've spend total 2000 scrips and haven't got any doubles or strange rolls (like all limb damage etc.), so I would say everything is ok.
---
I honestly stopped playing and caring about the game. The whole dropping the price with 50% within two weeks of release stung. Then afterwards the camps that kept disappearing whenever someone else built it in the same place. And then after that there were highly levels players who kept hunting or nuking me, while I still hadn't had any access to the fun weapons.
---
It's just all the fun things from Fallout 4 that are missing in Fallout 76. The only reason why I bought it is because maybe the fact that I could play it with my best friend would outweigh the fact that it had to be played online with other people who are at least a 100 lvls stronger. But my best friend is working and hardly had time, and I honestly don't feel like most games, especially online, give me any joy while I'm trying to get a job.
---
So I honestly haven't got an opinion on skins for weapons. I'm just a bit in a cynical mood. I hope they do give you more options free of charge though. But I'd advise to not let a skin stop you from enjoying the game, if you still do like the game.
---
as others have mentioned, the competition for our play time is getting fierce.  have no doubt tho that bethesda will put out an ad campaign when wastelanders comes out to grab a whole new group of users as well as have others come back.  they've also got the free weekend card to play that usually sells a few copies
---
Why would anyone buy someone's else lucky draw..?
---
Not sure, I'm just talking about damage though.
---
I must‚Äôve missed the part where I said I expected everything else for free. Don‚Äôt use straw-men, please. It never leads to a constructive conversation. 
---
The atom shop could‚Äôve been a nice money spinner for Bethesda, but just about every step they‚Äôve taken has been the wrong one. Rather than just supplying different skins for armor/weapons etc and snazzier cosmetic items, they diverted about 90% of new camp items straight to the store, and started sliding on their own promise of cosmetic items only with things like the fridge and scrap collector (I know, I know. Everyone is tired of hearing about them by now. But they remain relevant to what the atom shop is and where it‚Äôs going.) As a result, camp building has become totally stagnant, and that‚Äôs before you get into us having no new building pieces - well, you can buy the greenhouse or caravan for atoms, I guess. 
---
Prices in the store remain utterly barmy, because Bethesda decided they‚Äôd been too generous with free atoms but had no idea how to walk it back. Meaning once you‚Äôve used up the free atoms, you either pay the barmy prices or grind for atoms on a scale of reward vs hours invested that is so unbalanced it gives a worse return then just working minimum wage and buying them anyway. So we‚Äôre in a situation where Bethesda won‚Äôt reduce prices because they feel the new players (with their generous supply of atoms) would get too much for free, and so the store remains impractical for anyone who is a higher level and doesn‚Äôt want to grind tedious challenges. 
---
As for the overheads, sure, they‚Äôre there, but I‚Äôd bet they‚Äôre not half as high as you think. The goal of this project (from a financial standpoint, anyway) was to quickly construct a game using existing assets, and have it be a slow drip-feed of cash while the big teams were working on projects like Elder Scrolls and Starfield. You can tell this because the servers are forever on the verge of keeling over, and the team maintaining the game is very obviously an inexperienced skeleton crew. It doesn‚Äôt feel like the game is so much supported as it is kept shambling forward.
---
This is so sweet, congrats!
---
Maybe get a better ps4? Don't expect every single console to perform exactly the same
---
GL is awesome precisely because of that high fire rate + awesome audio-visual effect. Slowing down barrels ruins all of that.
---
The end of the year is usually busy season for developers to release new games. Most people aren't going to play 76 and *only* 76 for the rest of their gaming lives. A little ebb and flow around big releases is to be expected, I don't think we have to sound the "game is dead" alarms just yet.
---
I've been playing games and developed few small projects since Atari 65XE...it doesn't matter tho :)
---
I have to disagree with what you said. I'm loving both PVE and PVP games and I think, when done right PVPE games can be incredibly exciting and very competitiv. It's hard to make it balanced, but it certainly is possible.
---
Games where you exist in the world, go adventure but also have a chance to get yourself into a fight with another player or become friends are the ones I like most. I'm also certain that for a lot of PVE players, experiencing such events in a shared world can be very exciting, even if they don't directly participate (but they can in their own way if they choose to). It's like with war movies, we don't want to fight in a war, but we love watching it and cheering for one side. 
---
To sum it up, combining PVE and PVP in a smart way can enrich the experience for all players if done right. 
---
On a side note, I do agree with you that PVP in Fallout in it's current state is trash, but that's only because Bethesda sucks at balancing it out or didn't try hard enough. It can be done though.
---
What's up idea guy? I didn't read your post.
---
I think that probably has more to do with general drop in players-bet you‚Äôll be selling out again come November
---
Game balanced to be playable for lower levels, gets pointless for higher levels. Players leave.
---
Mmm there's lots of examples like this. Always quick with a reference to their fans that have passed away. Always happy to send a care package. Always down to invite some fans to their company hq. It happens often enough to think it's company policy but I really do feel like it's more than that
---
Have it use scrip idk i want it
---
Depends on the legendary stars. But they're pretty close on average.
---
Previous posts have stated that since they buffed the Vault Raid enemies, they seem buffed in the main game also.
---
Dont attack Indiana like that
---
Visit the Pitt for me. Ill try to go to ohio with that broken bridge in point pleasant.
---
That's when you start looking at all the pain points and realize that they are by design. Developers these days are being forced to make the games needlessly grindy in the hopes that we will pay for the convenience. Such as being able to organize our inventory in a meaningful way.
---
5 seconds for me. Xbox
---
Congrats, but choosing fallout 4 over skyrim? Sounds suspicious
---
I meant inside the misc tab... Not adding another "tab". they should file the holotapes in the mic tab under their own menu as well.
---
Some people like to mix it up and enjoy the tension of NW
---
Yay friends
---
I mean they're not wrong
---
Love it.
---
I think you could even craft it kindof like frog displays:
---
1. Craft a stash container.
---
2. Get the class of item you want in your inventory.
---
3. Pick the variant of stash specific container in craft mode.  The ingredients are: A. Stash box, and B. Item of the type -- hmm.  This would require an ability to be able to browse and select items to include, so maybe this isn't as good as I thought.
---
I suppose just adding an option for owners in craft mode similar to locking something.  Instead it's filtering something.  You click on the category you want filtered.  The problem becomes: what categories?  It could be your tabs, but I'd like the option for more granularity.  Like, pistols, rifles, etc.  Then I could be very granular with things.

I believe its just open all arpuns the area, I made it off the map before sinking into the ground
---
Some people are never happy lol. I have had similar things happen and I'm sure it will all start happening again when survival is taken off ps4. I won't do workshops at all unless I am in a group. I solo play for the most part so I probably just won't do worskshops.
---
Wow down votes. You people are uncultured swine and don‚Äôt get the reference.
---
How small is the team?  I kind of suspected it was small, based on the pace of updates.
---
The problem is time investment, they would have to create several different designs for each weapon, test it in game, make sure it appears correctly, see which one they like best, and if they like none of them they start over. Plus it would discourage them from adding new weapons.
---
Maxed demo is 32% damage. FFR is 25% damage. So explosive is still good but you need 5 perk points for it. Its good for my guy who already has those points and uses stuff like grenade launchers. If you have to move 5 points ffr maybe a better choice
---
Sounds like a John Wick movie, but that's not a bad thing.

Yea, I have pictures of me literly on the boarder of the in game map if youd like to see
---
I'm a bit of a trophy whore. I have a group that I play with on occasion, but I've since moved on to other games to platinum. Hopefully they release more trophies with the wastelanders update. 
---
I might be on occasionally with my group. I'm still trying to help them break into the triple digits.

BTW, if anyone wants to drop a nuke or three, give me a shout when you see me online. I don't mind jumping over and playing for a few hours.

Haha! I think the setting of tongue-in-cheek, post-apocalyptic Americana resonates more for her than high fantasy.
---
there are hidden gems like Fortnite and Apex for that genre and trust me, they are more polished too! /s 
---
I think this resembles that era when singleplayer series tried to add multiplayer modes in their games like Tomb Raider 2013 and GoW Ascension (yeah remember that one lol) as it was *the* thing to do, and all were desolate wastelands 2 weeks after release. I'd bet my right hand this'll be the case for NW too.
---
Yes literally every time I play. Usually happens with ghouls or yao gui
---
It should get better once survival is gone. The servers are bogged because of the influx in players and the event. Lets hope thats correct anyway. Thats kinda what im waiting to see. I had prime cuts disconnect me and freeze, dashboard, failed and all the other problems as well. I really get kinda annoyed when i go to do the cook off after i already have been lagged out 2 times and it crashes... All my meats spoil and i miss the event and rewards. Only happens once an hour and i dont have the time to just wait.
---
Just add a confirmation from both parties before a transaction completes. This way you can give the items for 0 caps and not have to worry if the other player is going to do their part.

Please don't give Bethesda any ideas

You might need to place your C.A.M.P. again (even if in the same location), scrap the saved version of your camp, and rebuild. There could be some weird phantom objects eating up your budget that you cannot see, place, or edit.

I would love to post my earlier build of my underground maze  camp but I don't know if it's a good idea.  
---
It has 4 people running around in it  for 5 minutes  trying to get to my vending machines.
---
You have no real benefits from building underground , but it's cool as hell... 
---
It feels like you have more control if you're camp and it was a real game changer for me .
---
My current camp has a deathroom . I have a notification on the wall to store your junk . I also put a warning sign outside the door . 
---
But people only want to run to the vending machine . They don't read the signs. 
---
One guy had like more then 100 bulk on him when he died . I picked it up and returned it to him . I think he thought he lost it all ...
---
Never run into a room  that has warning signs outside , especially when you have alot of junk on you 
---
I have build this deathroom because it's fun  I do not want to scam players , it's part of the  game . 
---
If Im at my camp ,I sit on the roof of my camp , playing the banjo and see the people entering my camp and or deathroom . 
---
You can get out if the room if you jump and hit the play button of the banjo , I always give back the dropped loot .
---
Level 3 safes always carry a chance of "dropping" plans. I skip over other locks as too much trouble, but I will always stop, swap perks, and pick a level 3 lock.

Which one is it?

I have a rare mirelurk hunter, man these things will defend your camp better than any turret can, they are super aggressive and fast
---
I'll send u a dm, the mods here have banned any mention of it specifically
---
The few tests I could do, the problem is that I changed it throughout the account, which when I changed it in one character, I also did it in the other.
---
It seems to be linked to the game configuration .ini globally instead of each character as happens with the weapon favorites wheel.
---
This greeting case can be very simple ... but I suppose they will be adding thematic packs in the future with faction thematics as well.
---
Been gone for a couple months myself, just waiting for wastelanders then I'll be back. Have other games to catch up on
---
Sounds good
---
Are people really ok with skins only being usable on one gun type and having to purchase more for other guns? You get a shader in destiny and you can apply it to every gun, armor, vehicle etc...
---
Greetings from PA, also known as 
---
I think they should make skins that apply to all of your weapons and special skins that are made aspecially for a certain weapon
---
Soon. 
---
Soon...
---
Lucky you. I spent 3000 in the past couple of weeks, everything was completely garbage. Lots of extra bashing and fatman, also large amount of limb damage. Zero keeper. Across several characters and different servers.
---
A glitch? In this game!? Surely you jest.
---
Something that will keep me up at night
---
Wait so it adds poison damage to ranged weapons ?
---
There is no confirmed, but about 8 months ago I read several articles that all said the same thing. That they took a ton of people off 76 an moved them onto their next games. With how slow they are at getting these updates for some seriously game breaking stuff I wouldn't doubt it's less then 20.
---
Not only is the damage insane but when you are on the receiving end you also get to freeze in place. Sometimes....if you are really lucky....you unfreeze to see yourself dead.
---
i fail to see why this is such a complicated issue. when i want to switch from my patriot salute to the simple wave, it takes less than two seconds to swap them on the wheel. yes, they take the same spot, but it's almost no effort at all to switch them. if you're upset that you have to keep switching when you switch characters... oh well? it's a quick swap on the emote wheel menu.
---
Oh yes. Bringing a deathclaw to the shelter. Be able to ride deathclaws. An army of deathclaws. If somebody needs it i would bring the cavalry.
---
I sell the pie for 1 cap ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
the thing is AC has exclamation marks for every little thing like codex entries , logs , characters , places and i agree thats super annoying , i just want some kind of marker for new loot i get or like someone sugested here a sorting option from new to old could be an alternative
---
With Borderlands 3 out now I'm taking a break until Wastelanders comes out. I bought 76 in January and have been having a ton of fun, just didn't expect the amount of bugs I would encounter to grow over time. 
---
That frustration, game-changing new content on the horizon, and a new Borderlands game to play were definitely the perfect storm of factors to pull me away for a while.
---
I would prefer to have a single gun skin to apply to all ur weapons but I'm good with what ever atom are not that hard to earn.
---
It is bethesda.
---
They prefer to remove survival mode completely right now than to try to balance weapons and solve current problems ...
---
With the excuse of Wastelander they try to make everyone look the other way ...
---
you haven't played since like a month after the game came out.
---
you missed A LOT.
---
best option is to check patch notes.
---
I don't think it was since I'm the only person that seemed to mention it. I think i just got confused.
---
From one account to another or one character to another (same account)? If it is truly one account to another why not just spin up two instances of the game and trade to yourself?
---
Or at least increase our CAMP and STASH budget, with all the vendor and display cases taking stuff directly from our STASH, it's so annoying
---
Nuka crypt has a map the has alot of lead nodes marked along with other resources.
---
Yeah that's a good idea thanks for the comment
---
I haven't changed my armor in a long time and I'm pretty sure I'm dying quicker
---
they're only worth it if you get the small percentage of "winning" one yourself. as actual food, they're worthless because of static spawns. it's a personal victory, nothing more.
---
How do you get the red firework mine? And is there a plan for it?
---
What's your PSN?
---
I heard those using the glitch are being ban for exploding a glitch due to it causing stability issues. I guess blaming others helps them sleep at night. Not sure how true it is but sounds about right.
---
Happens on PS4 as well.  I die so much from this.  Trying to exit VATS to Stimpack myself and end up in the PipBoy or Perk screen.  Try aiming instead.  I found that manually aiming will break you out of VATS with a lot less lag.
---
Same, on Xbox. I've also noticed that hardly anyone is doing prime cuts or meat week really this week.. I did a solo of meat week last night and surprisingly completed it. But I've been seeing a ton of the same people I see every day on the servers, not many others
---
It has been talked about multiple times ... the problem is that the server will implode because the more objects to calculate and show ... more problems.
---
What will be done if Bethesda does not know how to properly instantiate the objects and have a server in conditions that handle a multiplayer environment using a centuries-old engine? ...
---
Awesome. Cards look great.
---
I made the same exact suggestion in a post a day or 2 ago and got down votes lol... bi polar ass mf'ers
---
Yes get your money's worth
---
I‚Äôve yet to find a game that does it right other than maybe Eve Online.
---
I just want more stash space. 
---
Or maybe give an bundling feature that lets us bundle specific items. Like using winzip for files
---
Would be nice but doubt it would ever happen. It's honestly insane that everything eats on stash space and CAMP budget. If you want to use the bobble heads an magazine displays (full) put some food in the fridge an sell stuff in your vendor you better be living in a box. Because it takes about a little over a quarter of total budget.
---
I despise fortnjte and Apex. Find them boring and not fun. I enjoy nuclear winter a lot. It has all of the fallout charm and mechanics work really well. The new Morgantown map is pretty great. 
---
What don‚Äôt you like about NW? How much have you played?
---
I would reciprocate you sentiment of not having any idea what the truth the is saying. 
---
*‚ÄùMake a point of do one, mong.‚Äù* - DarthNick69
---
generally overpriced for what it is, but ultimately everything they sell is harmless. even the fridge that was apparently made by satan. i'd prefer it if more items were added to the base game via new quests (i'd LOVE a new brewery or scout questline) instead of just atom shop bundles, but. eh. it's not like anything in there is absolutely necessary to play the game. still overpriced tho.
---
Oh, he's not only a big moth, non-believer, he is the Almighty.
---
They nailed it. Attention to detail was perfect. They even put "levels" in the corner for each year we've been together.
---
i'm not keen on escort missions generally, but i do like the idea of using existing locations as like focus points for events.  and making a chally cake n bake would be freaking awesome lol! a cooking competition would also be fun i think (more complex recipes or ingredients etc)
---
I agree with you there i just like vanilla fallout 76
---
I got jumped by two at the same time, after I killed them I honestly have never seen one in about 6 months so far.
---
They need to fix the pet system ingeneral first, but this sounds like a great idea if we don‚Äôt have our pets die after like 4 server hops or relogs.
---
Let me know if you find 16 times the resolution in Pennsylvania
---
Wait what‚Äôs the camera fly glitch? I hadn‚Äôt heard of that
---
That's why it's a suggestion and not a bug :)
---
It is just as easy to improve that, because when people play a role, or simply make gestures automatically ... or worse still ... when there are bugs that make when you take more than 1 second to put a gesture you change to of favorites when you tried to put a gesture: /
---
And as I said, the gestures will increase, not decrease ... so that this lack of configuration will become more annoying.
---
If there was a chat there would be no problems, but it does not exist, many of us have to limit ourselves to these gestures that can make the difference between a return greeting or that they shoot us and we lose all our junk and more ...
---
Personally no, I liked separate stashes in Fo4 because stashes were unlimited, but because the stashes are so small there's no gain in efficiency from splitting them. At saying that if the option was in game I'd probably just ignore it, I wouldn't rage about it.
---
And if the high-level players could give the lower level players a chance to tag a few monsters before you kill everything that would be just great.
---
Yep, and it doesn't care for range.
---
So there's this evil-looking pixel on the border on how far your PC can render (further than it renders objects on consoles, to the best of my knowledge), and this pixel shoots you, and you're dead in one hit :D
---
Almost shit heaven...
---
Exactly
---
i don't find them as useful as grenades for my build, but damn they are fun to throw. after winning some in the meat cook i usually go to a low level area and just use em on scorched lol
---
Place a clean bed xp and musical instrument ap in your camp to use them often.
---
Join prime meat events to get meat for Grahm's cook event every hour.
---
Lol
---
This is an actual counter to strangler, from now on I just keep spamming CPU-intensive effects when fighting stranglers to melt their CPUs, thanks for the tip, cryolator, here I come.
---
It's mainly due to most high level players not wanting to play because there's nothing to strive for. I keep occasionally trying to back in, but I have nothing to care about until Wastelanders, and just end up playing for 30 minutes before going back to something else. 
---
I'd also say that 3/4th of the map is pointless to explore due to it being balanced around low level players.
---
Usually around 3-10 minutes for me on PC in Australia.
---
Well, congrats, *and* good luck. You're going to need both... :D
---
The struggle is real especially if you‚Äôre like me and like the crafting and vendor aspect.
---
Lately I‚Äôve  been bulking pretty much all junk components except screws and springs to like 100 or 150 and robot vendoring the excess.
---
It would be amazing if you‚Äôre perks applied to stash but let‚Äôs face it the game is close to tipping point with lag and playability trying to process and render everyone‚Äôs stuff as it is.
---
Try PC bud. It's like a quarter the size of console player base.
---
Interesting! I wonder what's at the root of that?  
---
I mean, either way, there is zero chance of me buying a new PS4 just to improve my spawn time in NW ;)
---
Whats with all the questions on this sub that can be answered with a quick google search?
---
Damn dude hahahahaha I‚Äôm gonna have to craft this to try it out üòÇ won‚Äôt be using it in pvp but might be good for the raids
---
I'm on wifi. I suggested that as a possible issue, but chatted with folks in-game who are on wifi and haven't experienced this. Either way, it's a troubleshooting step that needs to be taken.
---
I use rank 5 on one character. My gatling gun hits for like 350 with something like 75 explosive damage. I think its worth it. Plus I like using grenades and grenade launchers and stuff. An auto grenade launcher is actually kinda cool for PvP if the person backs themselves into a corner.
---
Characters sorry
---
Can someone explain to me at what stage that the silo nuke can be "stolen"? I have this quest and am about to do it for the first time and I don't was to have this happen to me.
---
Managed to get in 5 min this time
---
I have 600 damage resistance, and I feel like I die way too easily now.
---
I think its going to work superbly nice in PvE too, just mind your CPU :D
---
i'm surprised they don't have the card, code input, and launch controls all inside a laser door. the person who uses the card is the one who gets to go inside.
---
Happened to me after 500 hours, during a queen fight I saw my first one. I don't think I've ever killed something that quickly in a fallout game
---
Yup. More stash space would be fantastic, but not at the cost of game stability. Im sure I am not the only one concerned about adding NPCs with wastelanders. Hopefully that patch comes with some server upgrades.
---
It's been fixed, basically you took the camera out then did an emote and boom, you get thrown.
---
archery, athlete, and swimming. though swimming will need a bit of help from someone, if i recall you need to heal someone who's downed in water. can't remember honestly, been a while since i did it. but those are what i did.
---
Dang that sucks I‚Äôm just now hearing about it, sounds fun!
---
It's not shameful, was just curious.  Are you making a lot of Nukashine or something?
---
Todd_Coward! I'll be online after work tonight :)
---
Oh I‚Äôm very concerned when the mentioned NPCs.  Oh man
---
No! My brother's friends cousins aunties boyfriend said he saw the Mothman! He says its really a hybrid between moth and man! It almost killed him but he managed to one-shot it!
---
Are you sure your XB isn't on it's deathbed?
---
And all the enemies in a single wave don't spawn at once. There's a 20 second delay where they shouldn't be.
---
i think they should have tweaked the rewards a bit. have actual plans for the Tenderizer, maybe some new mods for it, get rid of the grillmaster's hat nobody can sell. i like the event, but after a week (and a half) of doing it, i find the only real reason to keep doing it is the prime cuts turnin for the scrip. and then. well, i'm already there, may as well do it for the xp.
---
I'd like to see 'perk profiles', whereby you can save perk card lineups for specific occasions or situations: Crafting at your camp uses a wholly different set of cards to clearing out a dungeon using a shotgun or a heavy weapon, so why make it such a chore to change them?  Why not allow us to save perk configurations to be instantly applied according to need?   I hate having to fossick through all of my perks cards just because I forgot to swap out my armour crafting cards before I left home and now there's a legendary deathclaw bearing down on me.  I don't really see the reasoning in forcing us to endlessly shuffle cards around when there are simpler solutions.
---
I would be 1000x more enthusiastic if we could trade prime meat for a fourth star on weapons that adds some burning damage, or a similar effect on armor that has a chance to set melee attackers on fire.
---
Costumes and flags aren‚Äôt that exciting to me, nor is a 20w vanilla melee weapon. I can dig it if someone is enthusiastic about that stuff, but it would be nice to have other options.
---
Do I need to be dealing more damage at end game? Hell no. I have a couple nice weapons in the 1-40 range that I use to level alts with, and burn damage would be great on a level ten vampiric pipe rifle.
---
Congratulations! What a fun and cool way to propose!
---
The Accuracy issue with Two Shot weapons is negated by Aiming down sights, which will make both projectiles hit in the same spot, or at least very close together.
---
Guessing most of the replies of them being too easy are coming from people using OP Builds with the right Legendary Combos. I have 450+ DR and my main weapon is a TS FFR Handmade. They are plenty challenging. DeathClaws and Yao Guai are scary when i see them in the Mire or Cranberry Bog.
---
Thanks for the report and the video! I'm glad to see this corrected itself, but I'm still going to add it to the list for investigation.
---
...shoot it until it does move? that's a good way to waste ammo.
---
i just imagine someone unloading a minigun on a rock lol

 &gt; Thanks for the report and the video! I'm glad to see this corrected itself, but I'm still going to add it to the list for investigation.
---
kill, loot, sell, build, repeat.
---
While the meat week events themselves are a bit monotonous, I much prefer the game when I can jam 10+ events per hour by running the mire dailies, several rounds of primal cuts, free range, and meat cook in one big loop while taking/defending the workshops along the way as well as getting enough mats/food/legendaries to wipe out the vendor cap and scrip pools in 2 hours per day.
---
Edit to clarify- the frequency of events and loot for the time put in is much better, but more variety in those activities would really take it over the top
---
By my math, with 5 ranks, you will get 12% more damage.  So, that‚Äôs 2.4% per rank. So compared to other damage perks, you get a pretty low return.
---
i agree.  i dont like BR games in general, but thats mostly b/c in my fallout hoarder mentality i loathe having to give away all that loot at the end of the match, win or lose haha.
---
You realize we have CAMP budgets for a reason right? Server stability is already a little iffy at times as it is. If you allow players to place things for free, we would start having MAJOR problems with lag and crashes.
---
Go to mark it 76. There is a player named queen of the wastes. Very trustworthy and advertises all the time.
---
I play PC and PS4. On PC I'm Meidara
---
They still shoot like you‚Äôre cross eyed. ü•¥ I‚Äôd honestly prefer a non-legendary over a two-shot.  My first ‚Äúgood‚Äù loot was a TSE, and I hated it. There are definitely 1* guns I‚Äôd take over a TSE.
---
soak in the experience; don't run/fast travel from location to location; ignore questing and just try to complete them organically; don't be afraid (or trust) strangers
---
My husband is all excited for private servers. I will be on the public servers until the bitter end! I like waving at random people in the wasteland before we both move on and do our own thing.
---
I am so proud of this community
---
Mirelurk Kings may now be the most dangerous enemies in the whole game. They're absolutely LETHAL to anyone in power armor (no poison resist, and this DEFINITELY got buffed).
---
Haven't noticed any issues with super mutants, but I'll keep an eye out for that.
---
I haven‚Äôt played an mmo in a long time but last time I did I had to turn off everything but group/guild chat.
---
The server-wide channels were filled with gold farming spam.  Mute-ing and reporting did very little to silence them.
---
Fot sure, my psn is gfg6179
---
yes it is because beth is doing a piss poor job addressing game breaking bugs.    
---
i want to love this game.  but the atom shop now has quality of life things that should not be cash based, bugs all over the place, trash matchmaking, and just broken gamplay all over.   so ya, there are better, more fun options out there to play.  Beth has one shot left to resurrect this game with wastelanders.  And if that flops or is buggy or is shallow, the game with totally die.
---
ya rlly.  do u know if there are any perks that extend the buff for food?  not good w/ salt as it only affects food in ur pack, but making the consumed food effects last longer?
---
Yes.  Borderlands 3 is partially to blame, but overall attendance in the game has been in decline since the Great Banning of January 2019 where many innocent players were banned who did not dupe, and they and their friends have not forgotten.  The community was so active and vibrant until the buzzkillers decided to regulate.  Additionally not much new content has been added.
---
The result may be that all we have left are dedicated Fallout fans as players, which might be a good thing.
---
I did 4 of them yesterday...
---
you obviously don't know the creation engine...
---
no way, athlete is one of the easiest
---
You can take a plasma rifle and add a flamethrower mod. This is legit
---
It's not that I don't like it man, I quite like it actually but I bought fo76 for its open world bethesda charm, not for a tacked on battle royale mode, and what hurts most is seeing that they can properly do DLC waves with wild Appalachia as it had shit ton of content - new locations, mechanics, items and even a fully fleshed out faction for an npc free game, I'm quite annoyed that they HAD to add a generic battle royale mode (its not bad, its just generic) to "waste" nearly 6 months of DLC time they could've used to fix the core game and add more stuff to adventure mode. We got nearly 1/10 amount of content offered by WA for adventure mode this time around and I'd like to blame our brand new game mode for that :)
---
At least Austin didn't work on that mode, and its safe to assume they have been working on Wastelanders since WA. I have REALLY high hopes for that just because they wasted so much potential, effort and frankly time with NW dlc wave. 
---
We only have one up to date Bethesda open world game my friend, but we have more battle royale games than we need.
---
server stability disagrees
---
There is only one thing we say to Death - not today!
---
YES.... the button lag is UNBELIEVABLY irritating! I'm almost certain that's how I "lost" all rise early on in the game... must have mashed x while trying to get out of all that crap...
---
Not new
---
BRUH THAT'S A WEAPON THAT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED FOR WASTELANDERS COMING BACK FROM FALLOUT 2. THAT SHIT WILL SELL FOR A RIDICULOUS PRICE. THAT SHOULDN'T BE AVAILABLE.
---
jk it's actually just a plasma gun with a mod that allows it to act like a flamer not a laser rifle.
---
No salt though!
---
IT'S STILL FUCKING FRUSTRATING AS HELL TO HAVE A FUCKING SILO SNIPED YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE!!!!!!!!!
---
I thought it was just a glitch. I‚Äôll sell it then
---
The more you change the existing classifications (for categories, not things like weapon types), the more cumbersome and difficult to program it becomes.  Not that programming that is difficult on the surface, but who knows what lies just beneath... [queue jaws theme]
---
God help me, but going from memory, we have weapons, ammo, clothing, aid/food, notes, holo, mods, misc, and junk.
---
Weapons - footlockers, lockers, duffel bags, steamer trunks
---
Ammo - ammo box, Explosives crates
---
Clothing/armor - Dressers, suit cases, bureaus, cabinets
---
Aid/food/chems - First Aid boxes, ice coolers, lunch pails, mirrors, chem coolers/boxes
---
Notes - file cabinets, desks, safes
---
holo/mods/misc/junk - ???
---
We still have tool boxes, cash registers, and whatever I'm not remembering that other things could go in, and new stuff could be added.  Breaking it down more that that would add more specific things, but also add to the complexity, but is certainly possible.  And of course, you'd still probably want to leave the stash-type ones for all-in-one viewing, as they are now.
---
Not a glitch. Plasma gun with the flamer-like barrel.
---
I quit in August so wastelanders dlc will be exciting. Plus i have back log of games to catch up on. My guess is many people are like myself, so don't worry, we will be back!
---
Just found out. I thought it was a glitch
---
Thanks. He has 17 videos on you tube. Do you remember which one mentions build area limits? Some of his videos are pretty long.
---
&gt;"I would reciprocate you sentiment of not having any idea what the truth the is saying" - IseeInHD, but can't write in it apparently, as all youve said is ooooh you're a tough guy, ooooh you responded so I must be right, and ooooh I will just try and sound clever now, because I had no point to make other than, oooooh you're a tough guy and I don't wanna pvp booo hooo. Pathetic. PvP is part of the game, if you cannot see that simple truth then there's no point talking to you, carry on playing fallout how you want but don't try and judge me or make fun of me for wanting to play it MY way, not yours. We are arguing over wether a PvP area, workshops, should be further nerfed to make farmers happy, well my answer to that is NO, do not nerf anything else, Survival, Ruined by nerfs because of farmers,dont ruin adventure mode too. Have a nice day. Namaste.
---
When a lot of us bought FO76 nuclear winter didn‚Äôt exist. This was free DLC and the focus of this summer. There are going to be a lot of things added and changed during the life of this game. You are complaining about NW as if it will ruin anything else to possibly be added to this game lol. That logic doesn‚Äôt make any sense.
---
Nuclear winter is fun... those other games are not IMO. It in no way takes away from future DLC. Calm down. I‚Äôm sure next year will have even more DLC. Some of it I will like and some I won‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt complain about wasteland workshop DLC for 4 because I don‚Äôt like that aspect of the game. They had DLC for everyone.
---
Congratulations again!! Thank you for letting us be apart of this epic moment in your life!
---
Na its not like that really. Ive played a ton of PvP in survival. Most people i do pretty good against some i dont. Just gotta work on your build
---
Its safe, but a  complete  waste of time for the most part. If you don't have partners. Especially the "second mission" where bugs constantly spawn. Don't even think of doing it alone. Even if your build is good, you can still die from a random Bug\\Ghoul\\Mirelurk that spawns behind you.

Only idiots ever bought them, they have a fixed spawn.
---
Mirelurk Kings are the most dangerous enemy in the game. That poison is just nuts. If you're a non-PA who's lucky enough to have 2 x 25 poison resist pieces, you might be OK. But for a PA wearer, those things are just death. Not hard to kill, but you better hope you kill them before they hit you with the Curare Claws Of Crap (TM).
---
I agree with your overall point though - Deathclaws should be an "oh shit" moment.
---
I have a couple of friends. But none of us have gone back worried we might lose our stuff.
---
3 builds all over 200 and this is the first time I‚Äôve seen or heard about it. You learn something new everyday I guess.
---
Haha what do you use?
---
Pvp
---
TSE is still good on a lot of weapons (25% damage bonus on every shot), but after the great Two-Shot &amp; Explosive nerf, there are other weapons that perform much better without a doubt.
---
My main is a Stealth character and uses mainly Instigating weapons, and Anti-Armor Heavies during SBQ battles.
---
Bloodied weapons are the most powerful, but it requires a very specific and venerable build to get the most out of them.
---
Your imagination!
---
&gt; -And I need to stop.
---
I was just getting interested.....keep going!!! :D
---
Totally this, and the Hunters. 
---
1 King coming in with Acid hands and 2 Hunters spitting at you will kill your in seconds
---
Well expecting anything to be balanced at this point is a lost cause. Bethesda knows nothing about creating a real combat system, they punch in numbers at random.
---
Lmao! What‚Äôs left to use?
---
It just works!
---
Nah they fixed Alien Blaster man
---
I live in indiana and I can say great.... well if u dont mind the meth and heroin o.ds every 3 feet
---
Lol.
---
&gt;the city is split into four parts, the bronx being controlled by the enclave, Brooklyn by the chapos, a gang, manhattan super mutants, and queens by the brotherhood.
---
Isn't that Dying Light 2 though? :D
---
It's my favorite one, but it fails too often to be reliable.
---
Yup. Zero technical reason for why scrapped junk and ammo isn't weightless and you can't scrap ammo (just one example). Some people argue that it is a gameplay thing or just inventory management but ultimately these things get monetized. I think that the only reason why it hasn't happened to FO76 yet is just because of the community push against it.
---
At one point the devs were asked about this and they said something along the lines of "that's not our focus right now, but if the community wants it it can happen at some point down the road"
---
I forgot about the Hunters! Horrible mini-queen spitty bastard-things :(
---
I can still get into the suite, the event though was one of the ‚Äòrepeat‚Äô types so it‚Äôs now as if I never did it - the machine in there needs Presidential Seals to buy the stuff but I got it all anyway. IIRC you could only trigger this after joining the Enclave. The Gauss Rifle was nothing special it spawned with a random affix so back then it was just a 1* legendary but I thought the skin was nice. The suit is rubbish, just gives +2 Charisma and as I said it now has no textures. The thing that made it all worthwhile was the Power Armor Skin, looks really nice - sadly it was a one-time reward not a plan or schematic or I‚Äôd be selling them :) I also tried to use my presidential status to get into those rooms inside The Whitespring and the locked cottages outside but still couldn‚Äôt so maybe they are reserved for something else.
---
I was in the same boat as you, and recently tried playing again.  I don't play it for the PUG multiplayer, but instead I play to either coop with a friend, or get my fix playing solo.  It is very enjoyable right now.  With the new modes existing for the PVP players, I have not had any bad interactions with random people in the regular mode at all so far.
---
My advice is find a new game, 76 is in it's death throes.
---
Exactly.  I‚Äôd take an Instigating Lever over a TSE Lever any day.  Yet the TSE lever is still sold (and bought) for 20K+ which is pure insanity.   To me TS weapons are frustrating as hell to use. 
---
Most of my characters are Bloodied Explosive/FFR builds at this point, but if I went back to full health builds, Instigating is the best option for a Rifleman build.
---
Melee hits not landing is driving me insane
---
I think herbivore/carnivore mutations affect that
---
WA was free too, so will be Wastelanders. Just because its free doesn't make the exec's decision automatically justified - devs can make mistakes too and I'd like to think they did. Look at this sub man, people are complaining and requesting stuff more and more and they are not wrong. Instead fixing prominent issues like endgame, performance and bugs for an entire summer - they added a completely separate mode. I trust Beth that they will fix most stuff come Wastelanders but this summer was a letdown for me and many fo76 players I personally know.
---
Awesome build! You really nailed the haunted house feel.
---
I never said that it was not wrong for the dude to take his silo, I just pointed out that he did not lose the card.  I offered to help the OP with running the silo, and or provide him with some cards.  It takes 15 minutes to run a silo so I do not know why anyone would steal someone's silo.  So maybe you should read the entire contents of the thread and take a good long look in the mirror before calling anyone an asshole.
---
You will greatly miss out on some amazing opportunities in this game if you don‚Äôt delve into the private servers when they release.. you don‚Äôt need to stop playing your main acc characters.. just some of the ideas the community come up with in their private servers will trump all the work Bethesda have done on this game..
---
I personally can‚Äôt wait for 1 life no legendary pvp servers! They‚Äôre gonna not lit üî•
---
Edit: I also can‚Äôt wait to see what people do with building servers.. I imagine private servers might give us the opportunity to build as much as we like!
---
Why give us a sneak peak at a feature likely change? When they talked about it (at PAX I think) they mentioned how they keep changing the system. That is why we haven't seen it it yet.
---
Oh, just let me fall of the obstacle one more time...
---
Nope, fuck athlete.
---
Have you considered the possibility that people downvoted you because it was a boring, half-assed comment that anybodys little brother could have made? Are you absolutely positive that it‚Äôs because people are offended that you‚Äôd insult Skyrim? 
---
If I made an arrow in the knee joke, and that was my entire comment, would you laugh? Or would you downvote and/or ignore it like everybody else would? That‚Äôs what happened here. Don‚Äôt take it personally. Just make better jokes.
---
You know you can learn weapon mods by crafting and scrapping said weapons right? Just checking, because that's how I got this mod.
---
If you're on Xbox I would be more than happy to help you complete your quest and do the run. I remember my first nuke launch. (&lt;--- this makes me sound like an old timer on my porch) I felt really accomplished. I would have hated to have that taken away from me.
---
Why are you so certain private servers will be free?
---
I mean to be fair it is fall and school just started for most people across the US, so that‚Äôs probably why the player count is lower than normal.
---
Well don't you think showing it and letting players get involved is better than putting players in the dark?
---
They work for Excavator.  I've put the Aqua, Blue, and Red on various frames (I have 5 characters and like to mix and match).
---
How big with just floors? Serious question. In a flat open area, how many floor foundations can you lay down within the build area? What is the length and width in floor squares. I'm guessing around 10 x 10?
---
It would be an interesting idea if they added 'Bounty Hunter' sidequests that function similarly to those treasure maps but more intricate.
---
It would lead you to a guaranteed Legendary enemy that drops a decently upgraded weapon/armor (alongside the Legendary drop), and has a simple weapon skin/decal attached that can be obtained by scrapping it.
---
That or add weapons/armor with skins/decals into the Treasure Map loot pools, those things are hardly worth digging up atm.
---
I might way down the road when I finally get board and reach lvl 500 on my main account. I should never say never but as of right now I have no interests,  but dont get me wrong I think they will be great for a lot of player who love mods. I feel like once they ate out it will empty out the normal servers and that kinda sucks like seeing other players and trading. That's the big question how will it effect player trading?
---
Nah,  Its safe, just waste of time.  It's fun with friends, but I wouldn‚Äôt advise to go alone.
---
I keep seeing suggestions to tag an enemy but how is this done? I cant seem to find an option for this?
---
Well glad to know they wasted development time helping two losers get hitched. 
---
Meanwhile the bug list is in the thousands and they fixed maybe a dozen of them in the last year.
---
From your lips to Todd's ears.
---
Yes! Yes! Yes! This is so needed.
---
Yes I think another week or two of free play would bring in some fresh meat.  They should do it every year during summer and winter vacation.
---
I'm not but my guess is they will be because almost all the good games like gta are all free, I cant imagine bethesda will go against this trend. If they are pay for I dont think they will be as popular as many people think, players already complain about the atomic shop why would they pay for private server. I'm sure I'm wrong
---
Definitely console needs it as well.. much easier to find specific items you are looking for
---
I've played the shit out of Meat Week and haven't had it drop yet.
---
If done correctly private servers will have minimal impact on the community and economy, at first we may see a bit of a drop in players in the main server as hype of private server will be a thing.. but that excitement will die down, and the high majority of the player base will always stick with the main game so don‚Äôt worry about that.. private servers will just be a fun thing to delve into from time to time with your friends! Don‚Äôt let yourself miss out you can still grind the main game too, this games future looks extremely promising with wastelanders and private servers ahead.. assuming everything goes well we should see an increase in the player base which will help fix‚Äôs the stuff you are worrying about being an issue!
---
Good tips! I'm trying to do this too but half the time I scap everything without thinking.
---
Personally, I would have pushed out way more content like outfits and made them only a couple hundred atoms each. Like how iTunes used to have 99¬¢ songs.
---
Also, even the Raider stuff seems kinda G rated... Isn't this game M rated?
---
Yeah, plus it tells you after you scrap how many mods you have at the top right of your weapons bench hud. I scrap weapons for bulk steel or sell daily but seriously have never come across it or seen it tell now. Kinda freaked me out at first thinking it was just a text glitch.
---
If they do this, I'd be 99% sure they'd charge you atoms again, and about 1000+ per skin because it goes on multiple weapons
---
WOW that's a great idea!!! This should be a main post . That is a great idea and would love that. I think it should be considered an event that all players can participate in, first one to the bounty wins.
---
Or how about no stash limit like Fallout 4.  All this stuff is in a relational database, or should be, which is capable of handling inventory data very well.
---
At this rate in ten years they'll be caught up with modern design practices.
---
Yeah its a nice addition and gicea me hope for aolid year two content. They mentioned this ans other QL changes on inside the vault last week. I'd check it out.
---
Oof! I feel you on the windows! It would be nice to also have a wall of windows so you could build a greenhouse. D: But yeah! We're on PC. We're a small group and plan to role-play eventually (in Discord until/if/when real chat becomes available), but right now we're just gearing and playing the game like normal. Feel free to add me--MaroonedOnTuesday. &lt;3
---
This is actually being worked on right now, the latest inside the vault said it was but won‚Äôt be ready until 2020
---
Wrong
---
Laser rifle also. But yeah, it was a half-assed pack
---
I maybe prefer FO4, although I put more hours into skyrim. I am also a Red Sox fan with a german shepherd though so it's kind of cheating.
---
Thank you for your response and for letting me know it is being worked on. In the meatime, I've received some good advice on how to avoid the issue altogether (by using the favorites wheel).
---
Im a rank 150 with t51b gear.  Seems like im dying for no reason in the blast zone. Especially if the blast zone is the golf course. Extremely annoying
---
I'm good with that as long as I get what I want..
---
If it makes you feel better, we have a law about dragging your dead horse down Yonge St. on Sundays up here in Toronto... Also, no swearing in city parks. No lie.
---
My Stealth Character has 15 agility, but I run level 2 Evasive, and level 1 in each of the Gunslinger perks, except during battles with large mobs (Scorched Earth, or nuked White Springs), where I switch those out for level 5 Adrenaline, it's hard to beat when you are getting a lot of kills in a short amount of time.
---
Demo is great for PvE; for PvP you'd better use those ffr weapons and put 5 points somewhere else (as I'm in the process of doing atm).
---
What they need to do with Wastelanders and bring in more of the instancing they do with ESO. The town's will already be personally instanced, so I see no reason not to extend that to players camps as well. It would prevent everyone from having to load everyone else's camp, and cut back on server strain. There would need to be a way to make the vending machine pop up, maybe only load the camp if you fast travel to it, instead of walking by.
---
Yeah some long hair with physics would be nice. They're lazy when it comes to dealing with that kind of thing. Making the clipping work well, making a seperate model for when you put a hat on etc.
---
Same. I got to level 20 when it first came out a year ago and had to put it down due to moving and opening a business.
---
I'm back now in anticipation of the Wastelanders update and am feeling behind with the changes.
---
Anyone know of any good guide youtube channels that I could checkout?
---
I wouldn't go that far üòã
---
Obviously. Haven;t you noticed they're known for their stubbornness? :D
---
If you still have a tenderizer i have flag plans.
---
&gt;DarthNick69
---
No it wasn't it was on adventure and in Survival its is even worse.
---
Yes I have that in fo4. A dresser for cloth and leather. A steel cabinet for all my metal scrap. A wooden crate for wood. But it would make it harder to access multiple stash boxes from a red rocket or train station stash box.
---
I feel you can get a lot of stuff built if you arent using turrets.
---
You never know, we may one day be able to say we play fallout without getting the stink eye from people.
---
Okay. Just wanted to make sure. You'd be surprised how many people don't know that.
---
I think you might take the prize on this one...
---
tbh if that's true that actually sounds pretty nice. I've always played the game more as a singleplayer so less people is actually a bonus in my book.
---
Her story/mission isnt over yet. Wastelanders will probs complete it.
---
I used to love r/fallout76filthycasuals but the admins are really abusive and rude.
---
I got banned and muted for no reason on that sub for making a post saying how the the fallout76 bazaar (2nd biggest Fallout 76 trading sub) was shutting down and suggested everyone to check it out while they still can.(very great sub. It‚Äôs sad it‚Äôs gone now)
---
I then individually messaged the mods and a few got back to me and helped me investigate why I was banned or muted. I went on Xbox as well to message one of the mods who did his best and will said he will get back to me. 
---
So then after 2 days I got unmuted and asked why I was banned or muted. After a few minutes guess what? 
---
#MUTED.
---
After a while I got a message from the mods to stop messaging them saying how I was ‚Äúharassing them‚Äù and never to contact them again or else they would report me to the site mods. I then messaged one of the mods individually trying to knock some sense into them about how I Harassed them or what I did wrong. He didn‚Äôt reply and *probably* blocked me. 
---
All I wanted was a update on the matter and I wasn‚Äôt getting a response. And I get a muted and threat from the mods.
---
Community is great. Mods are shit.
---
I also found out I wasn‚Äôt the only one with a similar occurrence. I had a few people message me about the news. It surprised me tbh other people had this experience.
---
Dr has always been a joke. It's the least effective method of preventing damage. Multiple percentage reductions have always been better.
---
Dr does less than you think and suffers from diminishing returns.
---
No worries, I'll just build everything out of stash boxes and bear rugs.
---
I don't care about cosmetics, so this whole thing is a complete non-issue for me.
---
It only hold 2 at a time. You will need to sit there and once 2 are produced,  grab them. Two more will be generated shortly
---
Yeah I grind a lot of places not so much for the cool but weapons and ammo. It kills me though when I need a mod and look up at the mods and I don‚Äôt have any or what I need lol
---
It's all those awesome exclusive games we get üòÅ
---
They've had a LOT of practice with those sickles!
---
Baby jesus appreciates u
---
I've tested it jumping from some of the highest points possible, and yes it stacks for Zero Fall damage.
---
I love these threads, they make playing FO76 sound like an important life decision üëçüèª
---
Funny how you see variety of gameplay as a mistake. Anyway you are entitled to your wrong opinion.
---
You do realize the addresses hundreds of bugs over the summer as well right? Do you read patch notes?
---
Kinda depends on the population of the server that you are on.  I was on and NOBODY was doing the primal cuts events.  I tried to do a couple by myself and ended up failing/running out of time.  People just weren't showing up.  The game ended up crashing on me when I was drinking some water (so yeah, that's not fixed yet...)
---
When I rejoined on a new server, there were actually people doing the events consistently.  I stayed on that server quite a while and fortunately had no crashes.
---
I think the overall problem is the low camp budget.
---
Same here! It's been almost a year but I came back in anticipation of the Wastelanders update :)
---
I only started it on Friday, even though i actually pre-ordered it. FO76 &amp; Forza H4 have had all my attention this year whenever i've had chance to play. From what i've played so far i am really impressed. Graphics are brilliant and the game play is very unique. Really wish i had played the earlier titles. So far so good for me! Enjoyed the youtube clip btw, thanks for sharing
---
Usually less than 30 seconds, but sometimes (rarely) I have to wait for up to 5 mins.
---
lol, it's easier than hunting
---
I believe the first part but if you really are single handedly dealing with groups of high level pvpers with just a Vampire gattling gun, they either suck or you're ridiculously good.
---
Either way good on you but it's still hard to believe.
---
I don't have any preconceptions about what it does, I just want to understand it better.
---
One of my toons is a bloodied tank melee (non-PA) and I am trying to build the best suit of armor for her. She has serendipity, blocker, dodgy.
---
Evasive, Ironclad, Barbarian? Bolstering? I can't figure out how much any of these are "worth", if that makes sense.
---
Note: I do not sneak. If I am hitting you, you know that I am hitting you. Very briefly.
---
There's a reason for that. Go on the Bethesda forums and it's full of praise from elderly gamers and kids with developmental disorders.
---
It's like a nice bland paste to them.
---
Its not just you. I get disconnected at least 3 or 4 times a play session. Its quite horrible
---
I love the idea of a deathroom a part of me would feel bad. Plus I feel I would kill myself as well. 
---
A maze sounds interesting. I was trapped in 1 maze it had 1 vending area and i was never able to get there. It was really well done in the Whitesprings Golf course.
---
Just wait for outer worlds
---
Other's comments aren't loading for me, so I am going to say what I am sure others have said before: your PSN is absolutely amazing!
---
Been too busy playing borderlands
---
Happens all the time, but it's not lag. If you press too fast it just puts you into the PIP boy menu. I'm used to it though.
---
That said i seem to die much faster to Mirelurk Kings and a Glowing Anglers. One Angler in the Mire took me down from full health in 4 seconds no idea what happened there.
---
Thank you! I haven't been playing much lately so i didn't update it this week but hopefully i'll roll out an update during next washout week.
---
I've had it happen with both food and purified water.  Yesterday it happened when I was drinking inert flux.
---
You can actually build a really nice town OP. I'll have to show you the new build but this is a pretty recent build of Floopwood. I used to have crops and a Brahmin with this same amount of buildings but I wanted to try out display cases. Ended up taking most of them down except in the Soda Saloon and Slocum's Joe.
---
http://imgur.com/a/kN6QdSV
---
The changes from the album: no dip in the middle of town, it's covered in foundations too now. It has the giant Vault Bunyun statue and two benches on either side as a kind of monument. I put some more stuff in the inn so it didn't feel bare, just some night stands and paintings. Also reworked the soda saloon almost entirely, it looks a lot crisper now. Put two outhouses on either side of town because where were people going to the bathroom?
---
I hope this went well, and if you haven't done it yet be very, very careful. There are a lot of people out there that will take advantage of you. Ask for references, check the references, maybe even try to find a Courier clan to help you out. They may charge you caps but.
---
What platform?
---
Edit: nevermind, I see the pc tag now
---
So this means there wont ever be any major expansions, just small incremental updates.
---
Shame. I was hoping to see annual expansions like ESO gets.
---
http://imgur.com/a/kN6QdSV this is almost as many as I could fit in the circle
---
With my build, perks, gear I can run around like a mad man killing everything. Sometimes it is a stretch to have to run all the way to the marsh and then run back 100 yards to take out spawns on the other side of the event area. Regardless, I actuall find it easier to do solo (less spawns and I don't have to hold back).
---
They are not worth it. I don't have exact numbers but its something along the lines of  300 dr reducing by 30%, so you're using like 5 perk points for a sliver of that.
---
The day Bethesda starts selling exotic pets, robotic butlers and emotes (that actually do a good animation) is when I actually might shell out some dough for Todd.
---
I'm spooked.
---
Wait a little bit more. It will soon be free to play
---
If not, get it on ebay for $5
---
That IS one hell of a selfie!!
---
Really the only thing to do after a certain amount of levels is look at all the paid content. I‚Äôm not spending 20-40 bucks a week so I can add wallpaper and pop up houses just so I can dick around with the build limit. Some of this stuff could be quest line  chain rewards or mini dungeons or achievements, wastelanders is really going to have to bring an end game. With actual goals to achieve. Scripts roulette isn‚Äôt cutting it and a 3 star weapon  I‚Äôd actually like to get would leave me with nothing to do.
---
I know I like the scientific value of it :)
---
Similar to "known" for plans, a read vs unread for notes would be a dream come true.
---
Nice!
---
smh can't believe ppl still asking this like it was ever a widespread issue in the first place
---
Poor guy... I've ran into it twice and only had about 75 hours in at the time.
---
Never know. If they start go get some more traffic with wastelanders maybe they will pull some people back in. But honestly with how micro the last dlcs have been I dont have much hope for Wastelanders. Even though I enjoy this game a lot an I'm hoping it pulls through. But with the garbage release of the game some people are never coming back reguadless of how much it improves. All they seems to be doing right now is leading it in the wrong way. They keep gating everything. That's not how you get people to play longer. You get people playing by making good new content an getting these GAME BREAKING bugs out of the game ASAP.
---
at first we thought the quest not finishing was a bug, but it's more likely meant to stay open for future DLC quests.
---
cant wait to get my set for some pve content and be able to put up some nicer numbers.
---
also cant wait for revenge on the people i blacklisted from my couple raid groups for being super toxic, gonna be a fun day when that happens.
---
Thank you kindly!
---
Having the sane problem on Xbox one. If anyone has one they can sell me, or I can trade my backup urban scout armor mask for the forest one. I have yet to even see one in the game and I'm getting,g desperate for one. Gamer tag: DrakusTheJackal
---
If they buff the enemies then people would have to use the broken builds to even stand a chance. Game should be balanced off of standard non legendary gear.
---
I still play :)
---
I‚Äôm no where near max and I‚Äôm a casual player with ok armor. Deathclaws are really nothing and they should get a huge buff. 
---
I think overall we should be worried about facing these creatures out there and try to avoid but most run to them.
---
Robo dogs!
---
Congratulations! I wanna see some photos of the ring! Vault colors are always a good choice. Perhaps the same color scheme for your wedding? :)
---
Doesn‚Äôt have to be widespread. The fact that it happened made it an issue.
---
Probably when the election starts or when Trump officially gets impeached out of office.
---
There's no plans unfortunately, it's a rare meat week reward.
---
Yea
---
I don't think that Strangler is half as OP in PvE as it is in PvP
---
Maybe if we get factions I will play around with a DeathRoom idea and become a raider. That is just what they do right?
---
I know, I was expecting something more terrifying like the Mothman Prophecies 2002 movie mothman.
---
Ive had similar issues here as well..im on running on a pro thats only a year or two old.
---
But....300 for 30% DR is exceptionally good.
---
Or did I misunderstand?
---
The game hard crashes when using vats during explosions, when consuming items from the pipboy, just randomly when walking around.
---
Love that loud buzzing right before the crash.
---
yup, I'd crush that
---
Hunting was easy-peasy.  The hard part was keeping the Yao Guai alive for long enough to kill it with the syringer.
---
Yeah. I use to be able to kill them in 2-3 with my Insti-Pattking Axe.  Now it‚Äôs 7-8 hits. 
---
Even glowing ones with Glow Sight 3 are taking 10+
---
Yes, the Great TSE Nerf of January 2019 resulted in a huge falloff in players.  Somehow the "Two Shot" multiplier got changed from 2x to 1.25x in apparent violation of English and Mathematics.
---
This is an excellent build and I love the backstory you established for this toon. One minor gripe your typoed ‚Äúwhole in the world‚Äù aside from that I loved reading the entire article!
---
That's crap. Barbarian only adds around 5% for 3 points and it's the most efficient one.
---
Compared to other perks and sources of reduction dr is the most expensive buildwise and least effective.
---
Its a decent event. Gets people involved. I'd prefer more End-Game content (like a "Hardcore" mode for those over level 50 where the whole map is a true wasteland covered in high level enemies.)
---
Rewards are shit.. simple..ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
---
Did you bring gifts?
---
Mate, I am trying to understand your post, not trying to post "crap".
---
Here's what you wrote:
---
&gt; its something along the lines of 300 dr reducing by 30%
---
I mean, can you rephrase or something?
---
If you don't know, that's OK. Just say so.
---
Thanks! Here's the ring! https://imgur.com/a/Y1nFuys
---
Yeah, you're not the only one to notice it. A lot of people have taken a break while they await new content. And I totally get it. There are only so many dailies and events you can run and only so many items you can hunt and grind for before it just becomes tedious. I'm still having fun with the game, but completely agree that new content is sorely needed.
---
Between the wait for Wastelanders and it being *that* time of the year for new game releases, an activity drop-off makes a lot of sense. Borderlands, COD, new Destiny content, Outer Worlds, etc.
---
I expect we will see things pick back up a lot come Wastelanders.
---
since it ignores DR its gonna shred the queen/imposter.  thats part of what makes it so strong
---
Sorry i was born with a tail and horns i just waiting for the day to be with my family in hell were i beling ^v^
---
It depends on the day on the weekends like 5 sec to a min and on weekdays 15 min to 30 min
---
I DID note that Glowing ones are much tougher.
---
Not sure it's a bad thing, all in all. I'm kinda enjoying some risk :)
---
Except fuck mirelurk kings. I don't enjoy those.
---
Greed has no limits, if people voted with their wallet they'd stop pulling crap like that.
---
I was saying the amount was crap not what you said.
---
If your total dr is 300 and giving you 30%, 50 isn't doing much.
---
You have sentinel, dodgy, serendipity etc that all do more than your total dr.
---
Oh this is awesome! I'm just getting back into the game after several months (same IRL reasons) and had similar questions.
---
I might be reaching out to Sentinel Looch if that's alright
---
What level are you? Probably below 50, right? I only ask this because the logic fits that you're still doing the regular quest lines and what-not.
---
I've been at the point in Adventure mode (level 175) where I'm only farming legendaries, finding junk to make ammo or repair gear, and doing some Atoms challenges; other than that, I play Nuclear Winter exclusively, because it's not stagnant, like Adventure mode. True, there are no quests and such, but it's faster paced and keeps you busy, and it's dynamic. Until Wastelanders, Adventure mode is simply dead.
---
This
---
There are different types. One that will attack and one that just disappears if you engage it. I saw two of the disappearing version one i engaged but was not able to take it down fast enough before it escaped. The other teleported before i could even shoot at it. I have like 3 challenges waiting for me to kill one of those bastards but so far no luck.
---
I'm lost.
---
Just comes down to your perk loadout. Happy to take a look, if you like.
---
I don't know . I'm not a raider
---
Or how BL3 does it, skins apply to everything.
---
It's all about the Damage, and here is the basic math of the matter;
---
* SBQ has \~37,000 hit points, and regens at 50%, so total is \~55,500 Hit points
---
* SBQ Damage Resistance increases with the number of players in the Event.
---
* Patch 12 (I believe) added the requirement to inflict \~5% to receive rewards.
---
* 55,500 HP x 5% = 2775 Damage required to receive event rewards or loot the SBQ.
---
I have been able to achieve this with a level 17 character by utilizing a lot of grenades and a high rate of fire weapon, but the reason this was changed was to discourage low level players from leaching the XP &amp; loot off others efforts, so if you can't bring the Damage, it's best to do something else until you can.
---
Im doing 5000 damage to queen in the time the poison deals 100 damage to me. 100 true damage kills me. 5000 damage barely scratch her. The effect of strangler PA is computationally intensive. The more the ticks, the stronger the effect - at some point of trying to deal damage to SBQ, ya gonna fry your CPU
---
Let's face facts, SB are just big bats.
---
Got moving Friday/Saturday, in full swing now.
---
... oh, you meant in the *game*, sorry, don't know.
---
Any gun will do all you have to do is hit them one time and move to the next one, I used to use a 10mm and vats. Until I got to do the same. 
---
I don't usually one hit stuff unless is a timed event, I usually use 3 or 4 gun for public events.
---
y'aint lyin.
---
Pretty! Looks like the band has some nice detailing!
---
Dunno .... no issues for me
---
Nice settlement!
---
That looks like 10 x 12 ?
---
inside the airport terminal bldg, on the upper floor, there's a responded down, and she has a small backpack plan on her.  There's crafting benches right there.  As you level, you can build bigger versions.
---
for the record goddamn the pioneer scout badge thing.
---
Honestly if you have over 13 luck and you have crit savvy you should ignore it. It doesn‚Äôt make much of a difference
---
Thank you. Great catch. I‚Äôll fix up that typo.
---
You can only rake shit around for so long before you start to smell.
---
In other words, there is no reason for people to carry on with the grind its not in service of anything and in all honesty modded fallout 4 is better for "fallout" and any number of multiplayer games work better for something to play with either friends or other people.
---
I tried for so long to like it to push through and ignore the problems but sometime around my 2nd time passing lvl 100 I noticed all the gameplay I did could be summed up with kill/loot/craft-sell and all 3 of those things have blindingly obvious issues.
---
I doubt Fallout 76 will last much longer at this rate even if they made it free to play i could see them having issues maintaining a healthy number of players.
---
not everyone does tadpole quests on an already established character, but also how is running an agility course NOT easier than killing a bunch of creatures?
---
That's normal. These games involve a lot of guesswork.
---
I don't want to quibble, but from those pictures it appears that the Oval Office is *square*...
---
I shouldnt have to have a pvp focused build just to stand a chance against people though
---
So it‚Äôs no longer possible to do? What the heck.... never heard of this before and I‚Äôve been playing since beta
---
I have yet to get a flag plan - you dont happen to be on PS4 are you?
---
Oh ok thanks for the information
---
Well some people like me are more into PvP than you maybe. I dont know man good luck though
---
It's $40 just about everywhere you look, including at bethesda's website and amazon.  You get the code (not disks), so you can download it immediately.
---
Fallout 76 Pets DLC. Only 18000 Atoms.
---
But I like PVP. Am I not a part of the player base?
---
The company is most definitely soulless, the employees are not
---
Roundabouts yeah good eye. Can build more but you can't build walls past more than 10x12. I actually filled up that gap so it's more than one would think
---
Since companies aren't people aren't all companies soulless?
---
Yeah i get that, but just because im not 100% committed to optimizing a PvP build and you are shouldnt mean you could walk in and solo wipe our team of 6 without even going down, i can understand if you had an advantage, but the gap between PvP specced and not is just ridiculous, especially when a lot is down to RNG god roll gear like assassings sentinal armour ect...
---
Nice, I have every jetpack, do you want any?
---
Look at borderlands 3, no micro transactions, can be solo or played with friends online, they paid for good music, and not a beta release like fo76.
---
It doesn't have to be a profit loss, in fact, if bethesda continues with other games like they have done with this one, they won't be making any games.
---
Seems more like a grenade build than anything else.
---
[Downvote crash-helmet on]
---
I feel like this is an XBox issue, tbh. I play PC and have not had this problem, unless I get too excited and click twice.
---
It's an ageing console with a mechanical HDD....maybe the devs are PC players with SSDs? I dunno.
---
apples to oranges dude, your comparing something with 32k hp to someone with 300 on a good day (100 in your example). clearly acid is gonna take longer to eat through a 10x larger hp pool. (or 30x for the 100)
---
 i doubt the 5k is true damage, since 5k true will chunk her hp out.
---
as far as "frying" cpu, someone a few days ago posted how to edit the .ini to limit particles seen to fix the crashing/freezing issues
---
CONGRATULATIONS
---
Here's the prep, I think I can kill the SBQ quicker with a lvl 1 rolling pin, than what the prep required:
---

---
2- Have every mutations needed to this Build
---

---
6- Health ideally below 10-15% (Nerd Rage¬†Perk, Adrenal Reaction Mutation, Bloodied Weapon Prefix)
---
7- In Game Time between 6:00 AM and 6:00 PM (Solar Powered¬†Perk)

8- Be in a mutated team where atleast two players share the Perk¬†Concentrated Fire¬†and¬†Cola Nut¬†with you (Strange in Numbers¬†Perk)
---
9- Be Buffed simultaneously by : Fury, Whiskey, Nuka Cola Dark, Deathclaw Wellington, Melee Bobblehead, Grognak the¬†Barbarian¬†Magazine, Mutant hound stew and Glowing meat steak

---
15- Do a¬†sneak¬†critical power attack to your target (at 100% Health) with your 200% main weapon (Ninja¬†Perk)
---
The prior meet week played better - the prime meat events were one at a time so there were better player turnout, there was always a legendary creature for the final round, and people were not quite so efficient at the cookoff so there was time for people to wrap up what they were doing and still make it with enough time to throw your prime cuts on the grill.
---
So part nerfed by Bethesda, and part player efficiency burning through the event. Still fun though and at least something to do while all the other public events have been slowed down.
---
I haven‚Äôt tested this yet but, I‚Äôve been told (and correct me if I was told incorrectly) that it gives you a massive jump - at the cost of all your AP, at the equivalent of five jet packs at once.
---
also things not to do while in VATS: crouch/stand up and exit VATS. holding LT (aim down sights) while shooting/crouching and exiting VATS.
---
actually don't do anything while in VATS except for shoot the target... 
---
otherwise you get the depth of field effect out of VAT, your iron sights stop working outside VATS...
---
yeah and the occasional wrong-button presses as well..
---
Uh hum...define elderly gamer sonny jim.
---
I have a set with 6 jetpacks on it and the height is wierd, first of all the core drain is ridiculous lol it takes about 4 full jet boosts and your fusion core is gone, I also cant seem to jump first then boost, but the few times I have been able to with spacing my jumps and doing this weird backward jump boost thing I was able to fly very high up into the sky and maintain the flight for a few minutes before my AP totally drained, and visually other than more jet exhaust there isn't too much more noticable effects, but it does SOUND like 6 jetpacks lol
---
I love this. Glad you made some good friends!
---
Do u walk around naked? If u were certain clothing or armor then u kinda do care it's just certain cosmetics. But thanks for the comment
---
You won't have to worry about this anymore starting tomorrow. Bye bye Survival Mode
---
This guy Is a huge troll here.
---
Congrats to both of you, what a cool and unique proposal!
---
Wait...what!?!
---
Probably not wise to do unless you want to meme about then, noted. Heh.
---
It's a recycled event, so I don't know why anyone would like it. It's only cheap "filler" until Wastelanders. And I don't believe the propaganda about how the event required player participation to be "unlocked", either.; it was scheduled and going to happen, regardless.
---
Exactly lol it's mainly for shits and giggles
---
But then the atom shop would be Camp 2 Win &gt;:(
---
That's cool just didnt know if u knew and didnt want u to waste points and not be able to use a perk.
---
Yep . I die all the time in my  deathroom , that's the only way to test it üòÇüòÇ and if you die, you come back .
---
Yes, my point lol
---
I disagree.  I don't see how this makes sense unless the cost of each skin increases dramatically to cover all the weapons.  I could be wrong, but I don't think it's as easy as people make it out to be.
---
I'll utilize grenades for those hard to reach places or to soften up a mob at a distance before I get there. It's handy and powerful, but it's not the meat and potatoes of the build. For role-play purposes, I see Tyler as a molitov cocktail kind of guy.
---
I got one on one of my first events... And scrapped because my stash was full. Lesson learned üòî
---
Someone needs to compile an entire song rewrite, this is amazing
---
If you mean buying options: My main account I wanna say I got through Bethesda's site and downloaded the game from there. I got the retail version from Amazon for my mule account, only to find the box just has a paper disc inside with a game code on it, and tells you to download the game from the main site. Go with whatever's cheaper, as you'll end up downloading it anyways.
---
It needs an offline mode so we can mod it and play with it like fo4
---
Happens in PS4, too. My last two deaths have been because I ended up in a totally unrelated menu trying to get out of vats, and while I'm mashing buttons to try to get back into battle, they're mashing my brains in.
---
I'm not sure; why don't you tell me? (J/k)
---
Nope, you are just a figment of your own imagination.
---
Sure there are all kinds of players in any player base, but PvP players are a minority if Fallout fanbase.
---
But this is just my own opinion based on the decline of survival and Nuclear Winter and all the cries against PvP since the launch of Fallout 76.
---
But then the company wouldn't have such a long history of doing cool things like this for their fans. They don't wait on Make a Wish foundation to send them some sick kids like Blizzard or other companies. They reach out and contact their fans at times, and seem to have a good track record of responding to those who reach out
---
Sometimes you find a great server, sometimes it's a crappy one. Sometimes people already bring their challys feed, sometimes people don't put out fires. Just take it as it comes.
---
That's the difficulty part. And to be honest, that poor little gun is not worth the hassle.
---
Just go for long walks and skip events. Start at wes tec and clear that. Then follow the road to harpers clearing along the way. 
---
By the time your done at harpers you should have a few more legendary.
---
Also dmv
---
White springs
---
Sons of dane compound.
---
And many other places that regularly spawn legendary mobs.
---
I hope your marriage goes well and you get a nice house in Appalachia and have a kid and then your entire family gets hit my a meteor you fuckface
---
Mothman is rad, dude. A giant moth is fantastic. You must be on jet, because you‚Äôre talking crazy.
---
üò•
---
70+ players who enjoy that vats aims for them and nothing poses a real challenge. 76 is a stroll in the woods for people waiting to die.
---
**Bethesda pls**
---
I had all my doors locked at one time, because it was no one's business to be nosying around my camp, especially in the early days when you used to be able to wreck player camps with impunity,  before they gave them some protections. Now it's just a habit to keep them that way, although I have actually removed a few locks. I have stocked vendors, too, even though I've not powered them for a long while. If someone buys something in passing, fine, but I don't advertise my location, either.
---
A day or two ago I joined it via proximity, ignored it and left the radius far behind. Someone else finished it at some point and I got the credit for it too. O.o
---
Meanwhile today I had the Fertile Soil event act like it was happening (aggro bots and the three supervisors) but the event wasn't on my list, nor marked on the map, nor was the option to finish the second stage available at the terminal.
---
How is doing a few calculations on their side gonna destroy their engine? I get the joke of people saying its a very old engine, but this would barely have an effect on the overall performance and stability. Im a developer, and I find it absurd.
---
Focus Is not on unarmed. It's a mixed build, with explosives as main with unarmed on the side. To be mainly unarmed you need more agility and stealth, more raw damage.
---
 the ultra and the regular Gatling both use fusion cores not plasma cores. If you put a prime mag on you gun then it would require prime fusion cores. Only the Gatling plasma uses plasma cores. 
---
I hope this solves the problem.
---
Same here
---
I'm getting that :|
---
If they had brought back Fasnacht...
---
All you need is critter chunks and greens. I can do that event solo.
---
Well I built a town with everything you mentioned 
---
https://youtu.be/-vfrblbWJjk
---
Funny though.
---
My camp is basically underground (but not glitched). I built on a bridge in the Mire. Close to the cranberry bog. 
---
On top of the bridge I build a raider ‚Äúcheckpoint‚Äù area and sneakily under the bridge behind hanging moss I sneakily fit a 2 foundation wide bunker that is hardly noticeable
---
Moral of the story, I love the underground part and it could add a very unique dimension (ha) to camp building.
---
Ps there‚Äôs a tunnel somewhere in the Bog you could fit a camp inside if ur interested.
---
Nice build! I built a town too if you wana check it out https://youtu.be/-vfrblbWJjk
---
I mean, even in ammo....
---
like I said, you really don't know their engine, spend years modding their games then you will know, but since you haven't I will clue you in, the engine can't just make stacks of something, it has to do it one at a time, so a command of 300 of something is going to stress the fuck out of the engine and will likely cause a freeze and/or ctd
---
If it needs to be loaded, it needs to take space. Server can't handle 48284 decorative items plus your camp. Only way would be to reduce the number of players per server.
---
Wow, I'm crying. Congratulations! What a great thing for Bethesda to do.
---
Game's not a year old yet, my little time-travelling buddy.
---
Tell me, what does the future hold?
---
Same i tried last night for about 3 hours, there were literally 4 of us on the server....
---
Um it may have been his 30 tips and tricks one. He basically shows how putting the camp module ins tree is best for making tallest builds
---
Thanks, I'm so glad you like it!
---
Thank you, I knew I could just try locations but I just didnt know where I would even start to look
---
That's stupid, they need to refractor their code base to be more flexible if that's how it's done, I hope the modders could work there way around it. Thanks for your insight on the back-end.
---
I'm gonna miss that 20% extra xp
---
Todd\_Coward on PSN! I'll be online later tonight after work :&gt;
---
I find Primal Cuts almost not to be worth the time. Prime meat! So what?
---
Jesus Christ. Go away jerkface.
---
That is a searing indictment.
---
That is so cute! So great of Beth to help
---
This is basically what all my characters look like:
---
https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2008/01/02/the-ungift-part-two
---
PC que is really dead except for after 4pm PST. Expect to wait several min. The PC player base for FO76 is small in general yet alone the NW.
---
I now have Purified Water and Pemmican on my favorites wheel.
---
Sweet set up. I like your circular base. Can't wait until they up our light counts
---
Congratulations! Lets make that 7 have a 0 behind it!
---
It's clear that the lights aren't all on upstairs for this one.
---
I hope it gets reimplemented in a better way sometime down the road because the challenges for unique weapons are a cool idea. End of the beta doesn't necessarily mean the whole concept got axed, after all.
---
At least during the Prime Cuts event in the Mire with all the Radtoads and Mole Rats, I was having my legs crippled basically every other hit.  It got to the point where I wouldn't bother immediately using a stimpak because if I did so in the middle of a wave, I'd be crippled again in 5 seconds.  It does seem like they tweaked something with limb damage at least.
---
The problem is compounded (maybe caused) by the seeming buff mirelurk kings received recently.
---
a lot of things with this engine are stupid, I really don't know what the thought process is over there at Bethesda, I mean I love their games but they are literally the only AAA dev in the industry that continually and routinely releases extremely bugged games, I know all games have bugs, but it's a literal meme with Beth games (that's BGS not BS)
---
It could be kinda like some of the pioneer scout badges that had specific items you need to find.
---
I'm actually puzzled there are so few weapon skins in the Atom Shop. You would think Bethesda wouldn't pass on such opportunity. I mean, look at CS:GO or pretty much any modern game.
---
**I love this**. 
---
Don't listen to the Haters. "It's not unarmed.... panties in a twist" it's not their unarmed build so it's "WRONG" but it's your unarmed build man. I made my own build the way I wanted, it's not META but it's my "Unstoppable monsters" build. 
---
Love the story. It's good to see people enjoying the game and still have a way to have fun.
---
Trust no-one, not even a trading subreddit. There is no justice when something goes wrong. Everything you need to transfer items from one character to one other character on your own account is already in the Fallout 76 game.
---
There is a character-to-character item transfer method which involves a trainstation suitcase, user list irl camera pic, changing between your own characters, joining a users game from your previous character's world...
---
There is a specific platform guide on youtube or written on a reddit post somewhere which details this method.
---
Sounds like SiFi. Could you link me up?
---
That‚Äôs exactly why this mode is dead. ‚ÄòSurvival‚Äô=‚Äòbuy duped legacy shit with real money and pretend to be badass on aimbot‚Äô mode.
---
I just did it with at least 6 other ppl. We failed, everyone was hustling to get it done. It‚Äôs lag and such that effects it. Also lvl ranking I would say the more higher the harder. It‚Äôs a crap shoot. Ppl do this all the time at UF event staying outside to collect. I don‚Äôt sweat it.
---
If you don't mind me asking how did you lose your arms? Was it a game of tug of war with a Super Mutant that went horribly wrong.
---
I use it for the extra xp and for farming
---
Haven't had an issue with it on PC, but Fallout 4 (PC) does that all the flippin' time. x.x
---
Plus ur not well informed borderlands 3 does have a shit ton of microtransactions .. i just asked a few friends that already started over there
---
Yeah no kidding. I went around removing an playing with stuff for a long time to get lights in the right places. Wanted to decorate the pub with more of the neon stuff but budget.. an thanks!
---
No sorry on xbox lol
---
Look Im not bashing beth its one of my top developers fallout and elder scrolls have been apart of my life for a long time, just pointing out Bethesda the company didn't sit down in a board meeting and help this guy, random good people who work there did, and thats where the compliments and praise need to go
---
Cool.  I will try to remember to add you.  I will pm my psn
---
Indiana! At least we're not Kentucky!
---
This is awesome
---
Personally I'm taking a break to play Minecraft and Devil May Cry 5 only because 3 out 4 last runs in Primal events had legendary enemy disappear before I could loot him and raged hard, ok with trash odds for loot but not ok with denying me my chance.
---
A good first step would be to actually be able to apply the skins I bought to the items they‚Äôre supposed to be applied to.
---
While I understand your frustration, this post isn't really the place to vent it. This Wastelander is sharing a special moment in his life, and there's no need to try to prove that the community (or members of it) is toxic. I am sorry this happened to you, though.
---
Thanks for helping him!
---
Yes this happens to me as well
---
*Canvas huh*
---
Still waiting on my assaultron robot wife, as seen in the vault boy cartoons
---
Got some force closes and the damn gunshots audio bug this weekend on X1X too coupled to some really bad framerate issues since the last update, especially on Scorchbeast Queen fights...
---
:) makes me happy
---
Bloodied builds in general just seem boring and too easy , maybe try a non automatic rifle build or junkies build
---
&gt;
---
I‚Äôve got the right weapons and the ability to be able to pull of a bloodied build but I feel it would make the game just pointless and predictable
---
It's supposedly coming to Steam at some point, but no proper details as to when.
---
there are lead deposits everywhere. check this map:  [https://www.falloutbuilds.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/41/2018/12/81cf730f.png](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/41/2018/12/81cf730f.png) . hope that helps.
---
not sure why you're being downvoted, I guess this isn't the best place to tell your story but that sucks, sounds really shitty that they did that to you.
---
I always go straight to the meat spit and as long as someone figures out to play the drum 99% of the time we complete the Cook Out.
---
Going for the flaw that gives you the ability to scream in dialogue at robots! Entire playthrough with whatever its called for fear of robots.
---
This one is definitely the worse by far. The Ash Heap Crickets often seem to not be super interested in coming out to play, so I'm halfway to Welch by the time I clear them out, but at least it's doable.
---
Cranberry Bog though... the enemies just aren't terribly interested. I'm so sick of "Defend the ___ against ___" and "Fend off the WAVES of enemies" quests in this game where I'm not defending, or suffering under waves... I'm creating search parties for the damn enemy.
---
Add me my IGN is Enzth. My main is 155+ an my alt is lvl 14 I just started yesterday. Discord is Enzth#4203
---
I play a lot.
---
Grinding for legendaries got tedious and boring for me, so I‚Äôm taking a break till wastelanders. I‚Äôve been playing Detroit Become Human and Kingdom Hearts 3 instead
---
A silo can be taken at any point in the silo but the most likely time is once launch prep is done.  There are three steps that need to be done.  Put in your keycard, enter the launch code, and accessing the targeting computer.  there are some checks along the way.  Once you put in a card another person can put in a card at the same time or after you insert your card.  Then the place where you enter the code can only be accessed by a single player and the same with the targeting computer.  The issue lies where you put in your card and are entering the launch code, another person whom has already entered the weeks code can put in a card and go directly to the targeting computer.  Basically any time between finishing launch prep and you taking control of the targeting computer the silo can be hijacked.
---
Something would be cool &amp; they were prewar so at the time of 76 the scientists might even still be human.
---
*oh my god* this is so adorable! Congrats and it‚Äôs so awesome Bethesda got in on it as well!
---
There‚Äôs a couple I met a few months ago that I play with almost every night and it‚Äôs so cool and cute to see couples playing fo76 together! They have their camps right next to each other and have shared some funny in-game couple photos with me. It‚Äôs a delight to see.
---
Here‚Äôs to many happy years together, you two! Keep rocking :)
---
Don't say that or Bethesda going to multiple higher lvl enemies hps by 10x to "balance it out".
---
the severity of the bug is why people fear it, not it's prevalence...
---
Got my first one and the Liberator's red pin on my first week on the game, and of course I ate the pie and scrapped the pin because I didn't knew how difficult it is to get these things, lol
---
can you elaborate on the gear?  is there any other reward other than the extremely buggy and OP power armor?
---
I still have love for Skyrim! And he‚Äôs correct, I just love the humor in the Fallout world. I get totally absorbed in a game and kind of abandon others at that time. I‚Äôll get back to Skyrim, definitely.
---
Theres actually a joke about a guy who asks out an Assaultron in the bubblegum wraps, too!
---
Thanks! Appreciate that you're already subbed! TCBCast?
---
Yeah, honestly the events in the mire and the bog aren't worth the time/failure chance/ammo investment for me. I'd much rather get the acid and the guaranteed legendary in the ash heap, or the yao guai loot in the savage divide. Heck, even just quickly knocking out the one in the forest is more worthwhile. If the event rewards were significantly better for those two, it would be different. But it's not worth it for just a few extra pieces of meat. I can usually do the forest one and then hop down and catch the end of the ash heap if they both pop at the same time.
---
bloodied builds are balanced because of their low HP, they are glass cannons
---
Great, so I could place 3000 stuffies and make everyone lag and kill the server. Smart plan there Einstein.
---
It worked for me a few weeks ago when I did it, because I was laughing about what the animals were saying while I was chasing them, and, the quest completed.
---
Thanks _hardboy! After 7 years it kinda had to be...
---
They didnt even dress it up though. Its the exact same event from last time.
---
I hope so!
---
haha, true!  is it too science fiction to get an impossible cramburger?
---
Junkies is a nice alternative. Lot's of drugs so you can cater to your build.  Also leaves open all options with armors.
---
Bloodied 80% boost to damage
---
Junkie 50% boost.
---
Not so try hard and lot's of room to play with. For example found a nice junkies lmg. Im not a heavy gunner but it's only 10% behind having all 9 cards in heaygunner. So... More room for fun without crazy build changes all the time.
---
$29.99 at Best Buy right now
---
I've been bloodied since basically launch of this game and I'm not bored yet. Yes you one hit everything but most things one hit you back. Shorter combat both ways
---
Alrighty then. I hope you find any happiness and/or fulfillment that you may be lacking. :)
---
its actually 70 damage if you hit all ticks with the harppon (already tested it.)   but you can get it higher with a gat plasma. i had hit people with it and they ware at 230 damage per second and there hp pool was around 300 lol
---
All legendaries are RNG. Farm wherever you want, trade in your unwanted items for scrip and reroll. Save it up for the Legendary Vendor sale coming up.
---
Like the first time we encountered one and I chose to run off a cliff to my death inside of fighting.
---
The loot is random. Any enemy can drop any kind of weapon with any kind of legendary effect. Best place to look is player vendors.
---
Other than that it's grind, grind, grind until you get the weapon you want.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been to this camp a few times and I noticed he had it on a billboard and somehow managed to make it fit the walls it‚Äôs pretty cool tho
---
I believe it's random what you get. Unless someone sells it, probably no way to go somewhere to get a specific weapon. Just have to grind it out and get legendary caps and take your chances on getting one from the vendor, that or collect caps and hop around hoping a player vendor is selling one.
---
whenever you find a legendary its completely random what you might get
---
there is no place where you can farm for specific effects
---
if you look for something specific trading is your best bet, other than that you just need to farm ad many legendaries as possible and hope
---
Not really. Look at the numbers. It‚Äôs 50% not 25% over normal weapons, at no cost of ammo or low health or addiction to you. TSE is better than AAE which is only 30%. The only thing better than TSE is BE, if you can stay alive all the time with low health. Some Aimbot users don‚Äôt like TSE because they say the two bullets don‚Äôt always land on the target. Use your own aim and there‚Äôs no issue whatsoever.
---
Thank you so much for all of your help! It was a perfect day, despite the pouring rain. It just added some atmosphere, right? :)
---
Oh god yes, this happens to me almost on a regular basis
---
I don't know if my controller is buggered up or if I'm hitting too many buttons at the same time.
---
It's all fun and games till a freaking deathclaw or sheepsquantch slaps you out.
---
I would suggest you equip your Raider Power Armor and fast travel to Game Stop then do what Raiders do best.
---
Please if you come across any Brotherhood of Steel scum do us all a favor and dispatch them any inhumane way you can think of.
---
You can buy one on the trading subreddit
---
you can't farm for specific legendary effects, fist of all worry about getting to level 50 before worrying about your legendary gear, it will be outleveled by then anyway, just use what you come across till you hit level 50, then farm West Tek and events for legendaries, then sell the ones you don't want and keep grinding till you have what you want, but again, you aren't farming for specific legendary effects, the drops are complete rng
---
I do have to admit, I have not had this crash yet with food/drink in my favorites wheel.  Right now the only aid items I have on my fav wheel are Radaway and Nuka Quantum.  When I use those, I have not yet had a crash.  Admittedly, I don't use them that often to know if I'm getting "real" results or not, though.

Hawke's Refuge has a very good chance to spawn a legendary both outside and inside the cave. I've found a few 3-stars there
---
Thanks /u/wendiwho! I've never been involved with a nicer game community than Fallout 76. Most everyone we've met and played with in-game has been genuinely nice or at least cooperative. We've both taken so many snaps of people, their camps, and things around the world I've had to clear both PS4's 3 times of screen captures and in-game pics.
---
I don't know how good they were but it was hilarious. I don't engage in pvp on here but I play in other games
---
Glad you liked the little jump scare! I want to try building a bigger maze and I'm hoping that I can rope a few of my friends into hiding in the especially dark corners since I won't be able to decorate as much. I feel like somebody chasing visitors around with a chainsaw would be a nice touch haha
---
Do you realize how old that would make me!?
---
I inferred the supposed "unlocking" phase as the addition.
---
Make sure to specialize in one type of weapons, don't have perks for more than 1 type active
---
I agree. I just don't see the fun in one-shotting everything. Sure it's satisfying in exactly the right circumstances to get that deliciously sneaky headshot and *boom* down they go... but not every time. It seems too unrealistic, like I'm some sort of comic book heroine; I think it should be a frantic struggle to survive against a mob. I'm level 80 and I died 3 times soloing Westek today. I'm fine with that. There are way more of them than me: I'm just one woman with a halfway broken gun. Of course this is just my opinion and not a judgement on people who do prefer more of a superhero-ish feel to their gameplay.
---
Player vending is your best bet. Legendary drops are 'random' so there is no way to farm a specific type of legendary weapon. The biggest problem is finding a lvl 30 legendary weapon for sale. Most players sell 40+ lvl stuff and probably scrapped their low level stuff once they leveled up.
---
Haven't really compared but gatling plasmas are much more sought after so they're most likely stronger.
---
We are doing it every other day on expert, and there's only 3 of us. I've written a basic strategy in the description
---
You can do bloody and then if it's too easy literally all you have to do is take some radaway.
---
We have camps on opposite sides of the map for fast-travel purposes! Ha!
---
100 atoms for a single-weapon skin, or 500 for one we can apply to everything...
---
I'm still waiting on a Gatling skin, BGS, if you're listening!
---
Oddly enough, while one of the groups I was in for Prime cuts near cranberry bog, we got the message that the event failed, but we had literally JUST killed the final creature.  We ended up getting 5 prime meat.  I was so confused becasue it said event failed - I got on my mic to just exclaim "how in the world was that a failure?"  Others were giving the ??? emote, etc.  Then a couple seconds later it popped up saying Rewards: Prime Meat (5).  I checked my inventory and I had five more prime meat.  
---
I think this was a glitch more than anything.  I certainly have noticed that it says "The more waves you kill before the timer expires, the more Prime Meat you will receive" - but that is obviously not true.
---
If you're on PS4, come visit! Post has been amended with my PSN info.
---
Good legendary farm locations are the defense events, watoga municipal center, whitesprings golf course, and just any enemy filled area. The legendaries you get are random. Berkley springs station has a legendary vendor where you get an alternate kind of currency by turning in legendaries that you can use to buy new legendaries. These new legendaries are also random to some degree.
---
Ah yes, this would be really good.
---
What I could see be done, some of them already having been suggested already, is i.e a gun cabinet of some sort for your guns (make that item based, not weight based, i.e a bigger would maybe take 2 gun slots instead of 1, while the Handmade would take 1). Also an ammo case of some sort would be great as well, those eats space.
---
For clothing, a closet could help, for PA, an armour stand perhaps?
---
I'll be genuinely surprised if Outer Worlds sells even half what FO76 did.
---
Moving my camp over there now, vendors filled with TP, buckets and soap.
---
Exactly. It should be like that. Every. Time.
---
You on PC?
---
Thank you! I was actually originally going to build a haunted house but figured a lot of people would be doing that soon so I did my best to translate a lot of those ideas into the maze. My only regret is that so many of the lights I wanted to use hang from the ceiling and I have no roof ;\_;
---
The scale and economy is so different in BL3. This gun? Costs $20. This one? $20,000,000,000,000
---
I like flatter game scaling. Just a thing.
---
Also, the open world is a bit more ... open.
---
I played on wifi in the past, switched to hard connection and the improvement was very obvious.
---
yep this.  The game is fundamentally the same thing it was last time they gave out a free trial.  Better to wait until there's something new and shiny to show off.
---
Think it came out two patches ago, believe everyone got it by mistake
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt imagine BGS isn‚Äôt happy as hell to see more people buying them, And I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm the only one doing it.
---
lmao who the fuck buys repair kits with atoms?? . i mean most of the fallout fan base is casual but jebus i didnt know they ware this casual... just do a loop on west tek and get supplys.
---
So am I missing something? The pic of the knuckles has over 500 damage. Why is it so high?
---
Ahahahaha thanks! I'm pretty sure Todd Howard keeps a sniper on me at all times but he hasn't caught me sleeping yet! &gt;:3
---
I just wanna store all those stinking holo tapes so I can clean out my holo tape slot lol
---
It can definitely be done, but keep in mind that there are also WAY more unique models for weapons present in the game than there are unique power armor pieces...PA being the first instance where they've released a "universal" paint option (works across all models).
---
The way skins like this work is whatever the modification is has to be applied to the texture map of the item...which is unique to EVERY item.
---
So to offer colors which can be used across all power armor pieces is to edit and then update the game with only 42 new texture maps per color (7 unique power armors with 6 pieces each)...and this is assuming other qualities like light maps/occlusion maps/bump maps are not changing, JUST the texture.
---
To do the same for weapons would be....a lot more depending on how you did it. The game has 48 uniquely modeled ranged weapons, 47 uniquely modeled melee weapons, and 7 uniquely modeled unarmed weapons (just glancing through the wiki). That means for every color introduced, its 102 files added to the game...with some staggering variety in how dev's have to think about applying the paint for it to look good. The way you texture a guitar sword with "camo paint" is going to be very different than how you texture a mole miner glove or a combat shotgun...it's not just a magic button you press, someone on the team has to go in and manually put this new texture into every texture map file, making decisions on what looks best along the way.
---
AND every time they introduce new weapons they'd have to develop all the currently available paints as alternative textures for it before they launch it...I assume they are planning on adding far fewer new/unique power armors than they are planning to add weapons (at least I hope so).
---
Plus this completely leaves out any mods being effected by the paint as that would also make the number much larger...currently I think paint that has been for sale HAS actually effected mods such as scopes/extended barrels/etc. being on rifles and so on....so the number would really be quite a bit larger than 102.
---
I think a more universal "paint" system like you proposed is 1000000% more user-friendly than their current model of selling everything piece-meal, but I also completely understand why the devs are doing it this way, at least for now. The multi-PA model paint pack was a move in the right direction and many games have added more detailed/in-depth cosmetic features like this once the game is more mature (see Elder Scroll Online's extremely robust armor dying and outfit creation system which came after launch).
---
Insert that meme of the guy tapping/pointing at his temple! You guys have cracked the code on camp placement. That‚Äôs awesome!
---
no. its about the same .
---
Oh I see, didn‚Äôt know that, never played a BL game.

The Mire is really good for Violet Flux. As it has a lot of the plants clustered together.
---
If you're on Xbox I might still have some of the raw Violet flux I picked up a ton last night but couldn't find anything to kill to get the rest to make it stable.

Strength bonuses from alcohol and chems, high rads with radicool, and a few 2 star armor pieces.
---
nah, I have 2 full sets and most enemies are highly resistant to the effect.    
---
It works ok vs a few enemies but generally speaking those are enemies you don't worry about in the first place like basic scorched humans.  
---
the rest take a mild tick of damage over time, nothing that would change the outcome.
---
Thank you! Will keep that in mind
---
The stealth boy is just too much. I mean, I love using it - but I wouldn't mind at all if there were a counter for it/it was removed entirely.
---
You clearly do not have a set.  It does none of the things you are talking about.
---
Most enemies are highly resistant to the acid effect.
---
&lt;edit&gt;Please note this is my observations, not speculation or opinion.
---
Probably, but I don't really think they have any intention of us being involved in that process at the moment. Besides showing sneak peeks only to deliver something different could bring backlash.

what other holos do you have there?  in my stash I have some games and Government Resupply Requsitions, in my inventory there are only the Overseer's holos and quest ones, once I finish the quest I drop the holos, for the Personal Matters holos I put them in her fiance's body, I figured that was the most respectful way to drop them.
---
The 2nd projectile only does 25% damage since the nerf, and AA effect varies greatly with Enemy resistance, I tested a TSE 50 Cal vs an AA LD 50 Cal on the SBQ, and the AA is far better (TSE max= 72/rnd, AA max= 139/rnd), both were Primed, and the TSE breaks significantly faster as well.

I had shitty luck last night was at whitesprings i killed 2 3* legendaries 1 had a 1* zarnies and the other had a 1* mutaint combat knife that was only lvl 35 was like wtf is this garbage. I just tossed them both in for script

Well wifi just adds more to ur ping, with that said plenty ppl play on wifi and have no issues but it's something to consider. For example my ping is "9" but by the the time the wifi signal gets to my wifi extender then to my console my ping is around "25-50". I can also say fo76 does heavily relay on ur hardware so a clean install is nt bad idea
---
You sound like me! Despite the amount of negativity and complaints I see on this subreddit, actually playing the game and getting to come across players has been a delightful experience and wasn‚Äôt at all what I was expecting. And coming across posts like yours today give me so much hope and make me happy that there are still people in this community that can find things to enjoy about this game/community. You‚Äôve just reminded me! My PS4 might be due for a cleaning out soon with as many screencaptures as I‚Äôve taken. Gonna have set aside some hours soon to do that üòÇ

I certainly notice a difference versus the Scorchbeast Queen, but the Yao Guai hit too frequently to matter.

YES  agreed.. DO IT!

I'd be happy to join you.  I'm not a damage powerhouse, but I will happily tank pylons and take shots at the impostor and the other robots.  I'm level 170something and I have a lot of stimpacks.

---
most decided to leave until the game gets fixed and finally enters beta, and is at least a bit functional. little they know...as i dare to say that even their grandkids can consider theirselves lucky ever experience this game run with a minimum of functionality.
---
And back in the day, my old Xbox 360 did the exact same thing on Forza 2, and the next thing I saw was 3 beautiful red lights blinking, so you can imagine how I feel when FO76 does this shit, even after all these years...
---
Wait - Epic? Not Legendary? NO STARS???
---
Maybe even add a shimmer effect while firing/moving - akin to the Predator shimmer. I dunno, but as of right now, Master Shotgunner+Combat Shotgun+Stealth Boy = Ez win
---
Keep it small and make it dense with detail.  You should be able to fit the essentials on a 2x3 plot.
---
Some bugs are just glorious.  The other day, my already high-capacity Quad Exploding Handmade glitched to have the capacity of my Minigun.  I have a ton of 5.56 ammo, so I had a ball just firing full automatic Handmade for about a minute in the middle of a Prime Cuts event.  It would be completely unfair if it happened while I was PvPing, but I'll still be sad if they ever patch it out.
---
I spend half the event looming over stinky piles, rotting food and burning brush waiting for it to register. I am also always on a quest to collect every green at once so I can dump them en masse for maximum effect. I have even, quite ridiculously, started to feel vaguely miffed when I see another player getting to the greens before me! :-)
---
This is an extremely strange build. I don't understand some of your perks at all, tbh.
---
Strength is good, no issues there. However....
---
The perception choices are frankly nuts. On any melee build, perception is a 1 - perks are just too precious. Concentrated fire, glow sight or green thumb (for getting flux) are all options, but it's the meh stat. If we could go zero, we would.
---
Endurance choices are similarly odd. We just don't need it. The stat gives you 5 HP per point, and if you're a tank, you just shouldn't need this. Fireproof is a wasted card, as the Dense torso mod gives you what you need for scorchbeasts, and nothing else (except shopping basket turrets) do explosive damage. I get the angle with chem resistant etc, but you'd be better off as a junkie, saving you more perks. Radicool is a great choice, though, and Ironclad is also nice if you have the perks.
---
Charisma is just....well, you need to decide. If you're playing solo, then it's Lone Wanderer all the way. I get that you can swap this, so great. But Party Boy doesn't fit either way. You either need to go 7 (if you want both) or go 4 and forget it. 4 was always fine for me - everything EVERYTHING dies in one hit except the SQB, and then you're into meathook territory.
---
Agility here is a mess. Sorry, it just is. You're playing a tank, so you want Dodgy. No question. You absolutely DON'T want a stimpak-sucking perk - there's armor for that if you want to macro wasting them. You went OK to Barbarian (DR only for 3 perks) but skipped out on Evasive (both DR and ER). If you look at Dodgy, it depends on your overall Agility, and so does Evasive up to 20. I don't understand these choices at all. Moving target can be OK, but bear in mind you need to be sprinting - not running, SPRINTING. This is what cavalier is for, and I'll post my thoughts on that bunny later on.
---
Luck is missing a major tank perk, which is Serendipity. You might think you'll be OK because you're a tank.....no, you won't be. You're at the forefront of the damage, and you need to have an "oh shit" option to save you.
---
I totally get there's a flavour thing going on here, but some of your perks are......lunacy. They get you NOTHING.
---
I did a non-junkie variant of this a few months back and he's almost unkillable. His name's Jackie Chan, and here you go:
---

I did change him a bit since - I dumped ninja and cannibal for 2 bloody mess.
---
You don't strike me as a min-maxer (I kinda probably am) so if you're having fun ignore me. But if you want some perk points back, well, might help.
---

---
I do non bloody build but still use nerd rage for exta damage when my health drops in mob attacks

This - you really have to divide and conquer here. It isn't the one to do to try to multi-farm XP.

Some punctuation forces things to the top, and some to the bottom. I wanna say a dash ( - ) goes to the top, and a tilde ( ~ ) definitely goes to the bottom because that's what I use.
---
yeah, I assumed it was a bug of some kind, kind of numb to them by now
---
For TSE the second projectile also explodes, so the total buff is more than 25%. Yes the actual result of AAE may depend on the enemies but according to tests it approx equals a little less than 30% buff. I don‚Äôt know how you can get 2x the damage versus a TSE. Different part of the queen has different resistance, the head for instance is way lower.
---
Could you imagine a new phase of cleaning up Appalachia by burying all the bodies?
---
it's literally the least we could do for the brave survivors of Appalachia
---
Those with the cannibal perk would have a field day
---
Wait, clean out your holo tapes?  Your not supposed to keep them all?  They don‚Äôt weigh anything. I didn‚Äôt even realize dumping any were an option
---
Agreed. annoying and frustrating..   
---
And for the 3rd time in a week when logging in,  my  missile turret was missing.  
---
Upon scraping the wire and attempting to replace the turret. Budget exceeded.  wtf. 3 times now..
---
Quad tesla. That gun is annoying af as a bloodied. Two shot gamma gun one shots bloodied and also has a huge spread so you can smoke stealth boys
---
I used to just shrug off the behomeths weapon slam.
---
Now it feels like in level 5 in Skyrim again trying to kill a giant with a sword.  Getting hit once nearly kills me.
---
I'd like them to lower the amount of people on a server, then spread out that budget to everyone. I think now we get what, 24 or something? Take it down to 18. I never see more than like 10 at an event anyway.
---
That's usually what happens. but as I've mentioned before, there do exist people who would rather be jerks, and they will mis-use game mechanics to their own advantage.
---
This is my exact sentiment at the moment. I‚Äôm hoping the Wastelanders update will bring new life into the game. For now, I‚Äôve actually started playing Red Dead Online. It‚Äôs actually quite fun.
---
I've yet to do this, but equally frustrating I have spammed the 'use stimpack' D Pad button due to the animation not occurring while I am in the thick of a fight, only to end up using a handful of them at once.
---
Hi First time here.! I try several times to complete the launch and cant get to last part.
---
I have cards to share :) any chance to do a speedrun?
---
Glad it turned out better than the guy who proposed to his girl on Spider-Man ps4
---
I still say give us the ability to use arm ones as flamethrowers like Firebats from Starcraft.
---
Yeah this one fails for me each time the enemies are off having a circle jerk and you can‚Äôt get to them fast enough.
---
Fine, then my 10 fridges, northman statue, whatever arbitrary limit they set to stuffies, walls, floors, outhouses, flags, junk bot, other statues, lamps, lights, beds, chairs, etc, etc. Could easily still reach the 100's. Still would cause lag and crashes. You're still an idiot.
---
The SBQ also has very High resistance to Explosive Damage which is normally 25% of base damage, but in her case, it seems closer to 5%.
---
I dont even build crops or have water purifiers....i take some when i go to player vendors....üëÄ...it saves me space. Don't you judge me! üòÜ Also don't have weapons. They're cool  but also take up too much space. Save enough space to at least decorate the camp with items.
---
Dude... Like... Dude... Are you sure this game Is for you?
---
How can it be stopped without putting other players game experience at risk?   
---
Imagine for a moment having to server jump to find a server with silos that are not occupied.
---
I've only experienced mild Lag when there are more than 6-7 players at the event, but the one I mentioned had 3 players simply standing around doing absolutely nothing.
---
I just got back into it this weekend after a very long break. I was doubtful I‚Äôd be able to pick it up again but holy crap did I enjoy myself!  I finally made progress on the main quests and even the side quest mayhem of mystery or something like that. I used to spend all my time exploring, hoarding junk, defending workshops, and mostly staying in the Forrest. But I picked back up at a level 48 and made it to 51 over the weekend. I finally killed that bastard mr. Gutsy at sugar Grove that I had such a hard time with in the main terminal room. Got a few new plans as well. My plan moving forward is focusing on more missions. I‚Äôm sitting at work today on the fallout 76 subreddit, so that should show you how easy it is to get back into it. I‚Äôm also going to try to redo my camp. I have an adhesive farm set up basically with a junk extractor. But I think I‚Äôm finally ready to move and rebuild. And no one has killed my Brahmin in 24 hours!  I‚Äôm at 796lbs though in my stash box now. Gotta figure out how to get that cut down a bit.
---
So basically it shreds PvP and provides a minor advantage in PvE? Nice.
---
Such a special snowflake
---
Agreed that Junkies is nice. I've been using a Junkie's Radium Rifle and full health for this past week's Washout raid - it works well. After playing Bloodied for so long, it's nice not having to manage my HP so closely especially with those Stingwings and Crickets.
---
COMMUNIST DETECTED!
---
By instancing the area when you enter, thats how. That why these asshats cant just stroll in and wait to claim all of the hard work you did. If you are on a team it wont matter because they will still be in the same instance just like it is for raids now....
---
I've had similar problems in the forest and the Divide when people build their CAMPS close.
---
What may work better for all of them is to add a bit to the creatures programming that they head to the barrel first, then start searching for enemies to engage. Sure their will be some that use this time to get some free hit's in on the creatures, but it would stop those damn honeybeasts from heading in the direction of Site Alpha instead of the lake where the barrel is!
---
Nicely done. Super easy to understand. Great explanations on reasons for having the cards, and connecting those to ealier perks and finishibg with the mutations. Good shit.
---
 &gt;Soon‚Ñ¢
---
&gt;It's done when it's done
---
Is this similar to the bug I had yesterday where every freaking enemy with gun would hold it above there head like they surrendered but bullets would still hit you?
---
Man I should have recorded that!  Darn
---
So the tick is 2hp each? Basically an inversed vampiric with 350% more ticks.
---
Bolstering is not nearly as valuable as unyielding for bloodied builds.
---
Did it workout for you?
---
I'm a snowflake for respecting the dead?  wtf is wrong with people on the internet?  no way you are this much of a knob in real life...
---
Hopefully your marriage is as sucessful and stable as this game.
---
I'm hoping they'll add in normal windows because I love the red barn pieces. I use it as accent walls myself :). I'll add you, hopefully we'll get to play one day. My discord's Rawgu#6969

I have five fully evolved characters. The most Boring one Is the unarmed who wields a bloodied weapon. It Is so overpowered, the game becomes silly. Fun for an hour or two, but then, there Is no motivation to keep playing. Best moments are those when you thrive in spite of danger. Best scorchbeast kill Is the one that makes you use all your ammo and leaves you half dead: my unarmed ninja needs one blow to kill them.
---
No camp build limit = crashing the server
---
He's just a Moth, man.
---
I can like the post apocalyptic playground and still respect the dead...
---
I was really hoping for new plans, but no dice. I have a hard time getting rid of the scrip I have in stash so even the prime meat scrip is a bit pointless for me. I can see it being solid for more casual players though.
---
Yeah I really don‚Äôt understand what motivates people to follow someone around and harass them. My first thought always ‚ÄúI hope they‚Äôre not grown ass men‚Äù, cause its kinda pathetic.
---
Update: I am Level 15 and super-addicted, met a ton of great people. Still having a few issues getting booted off server / losing some progress / items not fully rendering but no where as bad as it was before. 
---
Worst part is I just want to leave work and get back online.
---
Yes, spot on. Also
---
* One Violent Night needs to be out of rotation and on a trigger (based on time of day)
---
* Arktos needs a trigger as well, but not "someone walked up". Let's do something like Encryptid or a Nuke launch - and really, let's re-think the prep-time and structure of this event as well - maybe a forced count-down 5-10 minutes and then the event itself to give time for folks to prep and zone in.
---
* Hate messenger, gets stuck too much - and yes, Bot Stop spawns too many friendly-enemies
---
* Messenger spawns WAY TOO FREQUENTLY
---
* Cop a Squatter sometimes will not "finish" and I suspect it has to do with an environmental spawn killing one of them and not you
---
I still enjoy but would love to see changes in ...
---
* A Real Blast - can we not just drop random generic armor pieces and maybe scout mods or legendaries? Maybe also Dropped Connection and other Enclave quests
---
* I'd love to tie Queen of the Hunt with magazine awards, just because it is fun
---
* Anything timed ... still hate zoning in to something like Fly Swatter and immediately failing due to time. I'd suggest we no longer show quests on the map w/ less than a minute or 30 seconds in the timer or something
---
* I'm still bugged on 2 of my characters w/ the stupid scorchbeast DNA quest
---
I just got to the bos quest to drop a nuke been waiting on my other half to reach 50 so we can drop it 2 times for the quest is snipping nukes that bad??
---
I disagree. Most things don't get to hit you and serendipity triggers often. My Unstoppable Monster ninja hardly ever dies.
---
I know, yep, but I am talking about balancing. Is the 70 DR for my 2 bolstering pieces (agi and str maxed for Barbarian and Evasive) more valuable than the +6 stats? This is what I want to know.
---
900+ hours played and had no idea you could do that lol
---
I don't get when you vats something in front of you and it vats something 30 feet to your left...
---
Thank you for the info. Pretty rough stuff to come out of a couple young guys mouths plus trying to grief.
---
I refuse to do bloodied it‚Äôs flavor of the month and probably due for a Nerf.  Everyone used to this build will soon be hating life when they lose easy mode.
---
I run a mediocre heavy build and have fun using all heavies and still drop things pretty fast.
---
I run two types until I run out of ammo and by then my other two are stocked so I run those while grinding to replenish ammo.
---
I find it a good grind keeps me interested.

You don‚Äôt need turrets. If you‚Äôre making a vendor or a nice C.A.M.P., don‚Äôt waste your budget on turrets. If you are constantly gathering junk and building supplies you should be fine if your camp gets damaged some. If you are going to use them, place maybe two around where your generators are (that‚Äôs where enemies like to go).
---
Player vending. If I'm not mistaken it's a reward drop now, not purchasable from vendors. So you either have to farm for for it or buy it from a player.
---
It's kinda simple, if people like it, improve on it and put it out, if people hate it, change it. There'd only be a backlash if people like it and then they decide to change and make it worse.
---
Hopefully it gets better for you
---
I'm not saying there aren't ways to offset it, but you are literally running around inches from death, that's the entire point of the build, I, and many others, die way more often with a bloodied build than any other build, it's just part of the build.
---
No way your post isn‚Äôt trolling.
---
Don‚Äôt doubt me.
---
Bethesda "Sure but to revive the pet costs atoms"
---
Grahm proceeds to kill your doggo because he saw it on his route
---
Your doggo walks into water and stays there but as you desperately try to make him get out of the water he dies of radiation
---
A molerat burrows into your Base and eats your doggo
---
Bodies Respawn. They are loaded individually. You would be burying the same bodies neverendingly, groundhog day style. I respect Taggerdy and Mar√≠a Ch√°vez as much as anybody here, but the game does not work like that.
---
You need to exercise some self control
---
There is also an audio recording as a youtube video
---
Lone Wanderer is good for AP recovery and damage reduction, but if you're maximizing STR bonuses, you can get +6 instead of +2 from Whiskey when using Party Boy.
---
Also, OP's posting their build here because it *isn't* the same, old meta, so don't be so condescending when you come on the thread and rip on their build because it doesn't fit the meta.
---
Or during
---
It would seem that way
---
It seems like it‚Äôs picking up. Seen enough posts recently to assume it‚Äôs a problem. Maybe people aren‚Äôt speaking up or just shrugging it off and moving on with their life‚Äôs. But something needs to be done.
---
DR/ER are going to be less impactful than things that either eliminate damage by percent (eg sentinel reducing by a flat 8% per piece 75% of the time) or things like serendipity that just avoid damage altogether.  
---
Given a bloodied non sneak build I would have serendipity and dodgy equipped.  If you are melee or get swarmed a lot I would also have blocker equipped.
---
For armor ideally you want full unyielding with a combo of cavalier (75% chance of 8% reduction while running) and sentinel (same but standing still/jumping);for the third slot.  
---
If you use vats a lot you want powered gear for the second star (increased  AP regen).  It can help to have poison reduction if you don‚Äôt use vats.  
---
Ideally you want heavy combat armor with the Brotherhood of Steel mod for the best DR/ER.  
---
Expect a full set of unyielding powered cav/sent gear to be ludicrously expensive.
---
how is wanting to bury Maria Chavez, a downright hero, at all fucking trolling?  YOU are the troll if anyone is...
---
Another aspect that scared people was that Bethesda Support gave the typical "we cannot restore items" line along with some not very helpful advice. /u/Jon_Blue had to make 3 front page posts then wait almost 2 weeks after that to get their inventory back.
---
I wouldn't worry so much with preventing addictions. They are rarer than you might think. I swill whiskey on one toon and psychobuff and rarely get addicted.
---
That can free up some perks I think. I'm not a fan of Barbarian, but that's me.
---
I actually really like Fireproof - also consider Rejuevenated.
---
I'd probably drop Moving Target for more / better damage boosters (Adrenaline comes to mind)
---
Some of my favorite YouTube builders are :
---
Jug
---
Norespawns
---
okay, that is a proper answer, not "don't like one thing about something then don't play it" which is the dumbest fucking argument ever.  also no, only npcs spawn, the bodies are static and can easily be switched off
---
just grind MEAT WEEK and worry about it in a few days
---
Wouldn't timers stop people from "preping" them?
---
Seems I rarely hear bout this and I think it's a very far and few kinda thing.
---
That was freakin awesome congratulations !!! Perfect play bethesda and Lady Devann  your a pro !
---
No, they were I‚Äôd say early teens MAYBE. And they were at WS trying to grief and initiate pvp with everyone. The N word was dropped several times along with me being every name and hoping my mom gets raped. Not cool. I explain that if they wanted PVP to join NW and one said ‚Äú this is the wasteland bitch get over it and fight back‚Äù. Following me even after fast traveling away twice. Like I said before normally I could careless or if they stay silent and continue to try I stay in passive mode and then follow them staying in there face not allowing them to do much of anything ( aggravation defense) until they bounce servers. Doesn‚Äôt happen much but it gets old quick.
---
Was it your first time? I also did it once and never again. The last patch should have made them all available again,but this one probably slipped through the patch.
---
With borderlands 3 dropping two weeks ago, I think there are a lot of people playing that.  I am taking a break until wastelanders.
---
lol
---
Brick is overused avoid it if you can, I personally prefer a combination of warehouse steel and wood. Keep it small and build for the location. Generators are loud so use as few as you can, its also very easy to build a windmill into your build. Just put down a foundation put one wall in front, stack 2 on the sides and leave the back open. Move a windmill in and then add the back door. BAM! You have a power source that is an actual part of your building.
---
wow, yeah I don't know what I would do if my first toon was wiped, I mean I would create a new one and soldier on but I would be pissed about it and probably take a break from the game...
---
Those display cases will do it.
---
Or even easier - just instance the silos. Once a person/team goes in, no one else can enter that silo instance that isn't on that team or invited by someone inside.
---
That way, anyone can run a silo any time, but you can't mess with anyone else unless they invite you along.
---
I said don‚Äôt doubt me.
---
When society breaks down into a dystopian nightmare like FO76 then everything goes into survival mode.
---
Burying the dead which is a civilized act of society goes out the window.
---
It turns into stealing the clothes off the dead and if they are good eating.
---
Prepping them yeah. But as people grow daily in skill and power. Weapons and gear their overall time should be more faster as they run them. 
---
As a sneak rifleman I can do it in around 15 minutes. So 30:00 should and could just enough time. Maybe even add a few more minutes to safely assure.
---
I feel your pain there.  I've fortunately not been in many failed encryptid events - but the ones I participated in, I'm usually tanking at least two pylons.  I'm not a damage powerhouse, so I do what you said, sit on the roof of the shack and watch my health while taking shots at robots &amp; the impostor.  Fortunately I tend to always have a lot of stimpacks...  I would love to finally get the plans for "the fixer", but unfortunately nobody seems to do this event anymore - probably for the reasons you've listed...
---
Given what problems we‚Äôve had with instances lately with V94 maybe not.
---
I'd settle for a weight breakdown in each category
---
IE heres total weight of Aid, Junk, Armor, etc
---
Well, the water purifiers are my main source of income as i keep selling them to vendors for good profits. And I pretty much gave up on turrets as a whole.
---
Idk man. The triple nuke, so loaded down have to walk back to watoga is pretty fun.
---
Oh I‚Äôm good lol but thank you. It‚Äôs hard to get to me but they did. A lvl 53 doesn‚Äôt concern a lvl 220 on my 3rd build.
---
I'd need pics of your build to answer and/or name to come visit if you're on PS4
---
Well, I built the entire thing from bricks. I just recently got the Steel Building Set.
---
Are you melee or ranged?
---
The creature must also be less than half your level and must be by itself for the tame option to appear. There is a map that has a list of "pet farming" spots on it. Ive been farming several spots the last few weeks with no luck too.
---
The stinky piles, rotting food and burning brush have greater negative effects than critters or greens, so when you have a bunch of people chasing squirrels around that progress bar just keeps going backward.
---
Is your budget full?
---
Unless you play on a console. Then every game stays broken. Just saying people are probably use to it by now. I know that I don't care. Got way more enjoyment out of the game then concerned myself about small problems like putting armor stations in atom shop things.
---
It‚Äôs human nature ... sucks but is what it is.
---
Inability to track and restore items is really weird considering they wanted multiplier game for years to come like wow or eso
---
Deana is my moms name and this is the first I've ever seen anyone with her name spelled the same!!! Congratulations!!
---
I get that. But people will find a way to make stuff work good or bad. It‚Äôs just sucks reading people getting screwed like that for no reason.
---
for some, but if literally every post apocalyptic piece of media has taught us anything it's that those that survive the longest cling to civility.
---
you have to be next to them you can no longer just point your gun at them like you used to could ...if you are 100% positive the animal you are looking at can be tamed you only need animal friend rank 3 you DO NOT NEED wasteland whisperer at all I don't care what anyone else says but you have to go stand right next to it for the tame option to appear
---
Would be ok with lower player cap if it means we get companions that follow us but they already stated companions can't follow us around.
---
Cringe
---
Ok. I think I can understand your problem.  I am understanding that maybe you cant comprehend the part about placement limit.  So. I will explain for you.   
---
Placement limit is the amount of items that you can place.  SO your 10 fridges are not allowed. You may only place ONE.   
---
As with the Greenhouse dome's you are only allowed 3.   
---
and the comment about me being a idiot.  :) nice,
---
Wanted players really? The wanted level is only for picking locks anymore. Most pvp builds don't even have those perks. Such a comment shows you don't even know the game your criticizing.
---
And playing as raiders? What? Yo if I roll up steal your junk form your collecter and continue to attack you till you fight that's pvp. Not playing as raiders. The is also seal clubbing at workshops. Kinda why no one takes them. 
---
Nuclear winter is a different game that has less players every day. Soon it will be gone to.
---
And lastly a 180 with wastelanders? Are you so sure. Seems to be a lot in the game to support wastelanders before it was even announced. But you have been playing since beta so you would know this already right?
---
Dunno man I‚Äôm the one taking your stuff while you waste time burying the dead.
---
Just saying
---
/u/deanamae will find this awesome. She gets legitimately excited when she runs into other Deanas in the wild. Not Deanna, not Dena, not Deena.
---
I should have wrote this in crayon and stick figures for you
---
They did fix it. Now you can find games and not wait 20 mins to get into a half full server.
---
While NW is kinda fun and doesn't take it's self too seriously... It's not super competitive for people who like BR and it's not going to be played much by standard fallout players who already have a hard time with strangers in the world.
---
And that‚Äôs why Beth will just keep giving stuff that doesn‚Äôt work like it should. Cuz players overall know that Beth can‚Äôt create stuff that works and they are fine with it I guess ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
In the end, it‚Äôs the players fault they keep doing this.
---
I got an easy kill cause someone tried to jump and froze momentarily. When they reappeared where they should have been, they were downed because all my shots counted.
---
Fallout 76 is been story of how Bethesda loves to follow the good enough motto where if its good enough then its ok for release.
---
If your DR is equal to the incoming damage, then it absorbs half of that. Also, multiplying DR by **x** means that you take **x^0.365** times less damage, so there are diminishing returns with higher resistance. In practice, the maximum amount absorbed is 0.76*DR points if the damage is about 2.8 times higher than DR, and if it is at least 6.5 times higher, then the armor is essentially fully penetrated, and becomes useless (it still reduces damage by a fixed 1%). In some ways, it is more like a damage threshold, but with a non-linear curve instead of a simple subtraction.
---
If you already have relatively high damage resistance, then the percentage reduction effects become more useful. For example, increasing DR from 200 to 250 means about 8% less damage, but even a single piece of armor with a 15% reduction is better than that. And the advantage is even greater if the reduction effect stacks from multiple pieces of armor.
---
**Edit:** I am not sure if reduction effects are applied before or after resistance, but if before, that makes them even more powerful.
---
Just had a lvl 20-something wanted during Grahm's cook-off last night. More than 10 other players running around and noone ever event took a shot at him.
---
Even when I would jump over to the Survival servers to get the week's legendary there were few players and they would just wave when we ran into each other.
---
and as someone who knows how to fend for myself I will be fine, meanwhile the people that need to steal from others, such as yourself, won't survive for very long
---
I have one can't remember the stats on it though whatcha offering for it?
---
Edit: sent you a dm about it bud
---
That's cool cause im not looking to put an armor station in my camper. So works fine. Also did you try the rug trick?
---
So now you want to nerf the existing placement limits of paid for items? That would not sit well with the community at all.
---
I am glad it's not just me!!! I almost died from some scorched because nothing was registering against them.
---
Look out for the sierra bravo across the street.
---
Bloodied can be fun for sure, but that's totally a relative term. I love running around meleeing things and doing big damage but getting killed a bunch. One of my friends enjoys sneaking around and shooting things unseen. I can totally get why being able to kill everything instantly without any risk could be tedious, which is why I think a soft bloodied commando without sneak could be cool. You hit hard, but also get hit hard. Kinda like survival mode in 4
---
The whole camp building is shitty. I got the greenhouse and the bungalow, both are a pain when it comes to building inside. (You can first place the workbenches on a small carpet and then place it wherever you want, works fine inside both) Same with placing things at all, compared to FO4. And they know it.
---
And they will work on it, when they have capacity. Like they already fixed the crops and also immediately the absolutely broken Mr fuzzy ride. (Those who could spend more money for more capacity only look for invest/profit and don't care about anyone's opinion.)
---
I think you'll always see the atomic shop pictures after you joined a server.
---
And I kind of 'accept' it because I love the game and I'm used to wait for games I like. 
---
Play it less if it annoys you. I play maybe 3x per week atm, but I can't wait for wastelanders, I'll probably play it every day again like after release.
---
Not likely before Wastelanders comes out haha.
---
tthe part about being twice the lvl is not true (it may have been at one time) i shared animal friend rank 3 with my alt account  (he is only lvl 20) and tamed a lvl 20 sloth
---
I feel like it happens a lot when I'm sprinting or vats-ing then hitting quickly. If I'm slower and deliberate, the hits land
---
I still get it with the favorite wheel FYI.
---
Extra storage perhaps ?
---
if you are on xbox i would be glad to help you out with this i have tamed just about everything in the game I currently have a mirelurk king
---
Oh oh how is it pronounced!?
---
Yes but latency when it comes to fighting someone say I'm in america fighting an Asutralian, will end up being a buggy laggy fight.
---
A sucker is born every minute. Someone will buy it.
---
Yep.
---
I am entirely against silo sniping, but as pointed out in the comments of an earlier post if you allow a player to lock out a silo trolls will just abuse it.  the answer is not easy, the best solution would be instanced silos but then there's the potential for more than 3 nukes on a map...
---
Ive been looking for a pet for weeks. All my usual spots are giving me nothing.
---
I'd take a damn radtoad at this point.
---
Na, and should I use a glitch to make something that is suppose to work, work? That‚Äôs even more dumb. 
---
It‚Äôs a lot more that doesn‚Äôt work with that Camper tho. And it‚Äôs not just the camper like I said. They can‚Äôt even get the Atom Shop to work.
---
Encryptid is hit or miss.  I run in a group and we do it regularly.  We really try to make sure higher level players are around and even then we tend to end up holding all the pylons.  When we trigger it people show up though as there are  4-8 players there from my group.
---
Well then it need many more players to be viable. I just explained to why many don't play it.
---
When games have lower population they have to open the servers up. Happens when a game is no longer flavor of the month.
---
And how do you deal with the actual launch?   Whichever instance gets there first?  Everyone in another instance is just out of luck?
---
Yay South Dakota! Central Part of the State here. I thought I might be the only one playing from So. Dak! HA!
---
Congrats!
---
Allll the time. So much that I've learned to plan for it lol
---
You could have your armor bench they way you want it. But whatever dude. Keep on crying.  Thats totally going to get your bench In there
---
Ah, thank you for your concern my friend :)
---
what system are you on
---
But it still counts against your stash ... there is no extra storage that way.
---
Try not to make a big cube. Keep it small and compact and mess around with half walls and roof shapes. Try and copy something you've seen somewhere else like on the falloutsettlements sub.
---
Also take your time with it, get weird with it, and play around with interior design
---
Don‚Äôt you think quantity and demand matters though? I can make 500 caps in a couple hours just letting stuff be marketed super cheap (tons of level 5 armor for 10 caps, level 5 guns for 10 caps, etc)
---
I sell cores for 20 and everything else is 1 cap. Competition is tough.
---
I'm on console.  üòú
---
Edit: wrong reply. 
---
No theyre stuck in "falling" animation. Most games will literally drop rigidbody items after they load in so they don't get caught on any ground geometry. Most likely these enemies took too long to load, which caused the animation to kick in, and then the system doesn't recognize that they are on the ground to reset them.
---
Edit 2: Scorched appearing sideways, is because they load in prone position, but they don't drop, they slowly lower to the ground, which can cause them to get stuck in the ground geometry. I think Scorched have the most animations which is they they are more often broken then other enemies.
---
Yeah, and what stops someone from just being a jerk and keeping a silo locked up for 30 minutes doing nothing?
---
There is no ideal solution to this problem.  Perhaps during the launch prep phase, the control room gets locked down until it's ready to launch, so at the very least, a nuke poacher would have to deal with that.
---
I agree. That‚Äôs why I figured a timer would be ideal. Someone‚Äôs inside? For how long and how much time is left. And also figure a map overview would help with that. So you as the player can decide if waiting or hopping is needed. Realistically the ones trying to hostage the silo are the ones losing. At the minimum 3 players are doing nothing.  And 3 full teams doing the same means little to someone who can just swap out. 
---
I do like the instanced silos but like I said to someone else instanced zones need to be tested more from BGSA. Seeing as vault raids were shaky.
---
At Graham's cookout I sometimes have to try to hit those squirrels 3 or 4 times in VATS before the hit actually registers. I've taken to not using VATS if it starts (which is a pain on those little buggers) just to avoid the glitch. In my experience it's definitely with fast pace VATS melee combat.
---
I barely find 8 people at any given time on PC EU. And this was before BL3 came out.
---
I just caught you with nothing but a shovel.....the sunlight glistens through the trees and shines upon my handmade which I have named Justice.
---
I pray to my god asking for a steady hand, calm breath, and accuracy as I squeeze two off.
---
You slump over your shovel.....
---
dirty tactics for a dirty war
---
Anybody selling mirror ball plans?
---
This is top1 evil tactic I came up with.
---
It does. But someone is always looking for something. It comes down to what someone is willing to spend.
---
I sometimes get my missile launcher out on those critters if there aren't many people at the event. Wouldn't wanna inconvenience anyone else but if my hits don't land I sometimes think "avoid THIS you furry jerk"
---
30 minutes of being a dick is more than enough for a troll
---
I like to think I have a decent amount of storage space left. I‚Äôm not sure how much I need. I just want a cat lol
---
CANVAS CONTROVERSY!! REEEEE
---
Keep your task manager up in the background or on a second monitor if you have one. When the game freezes, tab over to it and kill the task from there. No need to restart.
---
username checks out, look, it is entirely possible for one with respect and values to survive in a wasteland.  but do go on trolling...
---
I‚Äôm on ps4
---
You'd think it would also be super easy to put a check on the launch activator to prevent people who weren't in the team that used the keycard from jacking it.
---
Ha!  That‚Äôs cool.
---
I didn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a perfect solution. It‚Äôs better than telling people to deal with it. Problem with locking the launch room is if someone is in there with you. They now are able to access the terminals needed to launch. Even if they are just ‚Äúhelping‚Äù what stops them?
---
Maybe this is the default price and they're just clueless noobs? So they just hit *sell* and think the *suggestion* might be okay.
---
well if anyone of you are on xbox i am standing next to a lvl 5 tamable mirelurk i will wait for a few min
---
No. People use silos to farm materials and could go afk.
---
I feel like it really brings people together. It really helped me level up a bit as well so I can use the cooler PA stuff I had hoarded in my stash box
---
I agree. But what else could be done?  Instanced silos would be the best choice but we don‚Äôt know the stability of that. And given that it‚Äôs the core thing we do having it break is no good. Hell what if some one runs a instanced silo and the game flops and they lost their items?
---
I have one in my stash. Don‚Äôt use it coz I don‚Äôt like -2 Per. Make me an offer ;)
---
Cute
---
Learn to do the silos quickly. Problem solved. It takes 12 minutes and I have 2 more nukes to launch after yours. Move it or lose it.
---
School
---
They are stronger as they have some balistic damage but they are not hit scan. So farther away something is harder it is to hit them with the slow moving plasma... Ball.
---
Free market? Those people don‚Äôt make sales
---
well spawn in at abbys bunker go south down the road past the wendigos and there will be a "random spawn " there keep checking that (with your perk equipt at all times) and reapeat till you find something tameable ..that is the best spot IMO
---
nothing.  that's the point, the current system is the best system we have, and since this isn't a PvE game it makes sense that one vault dweller can bully another, weaker vault dweller.  my solution is turn off pacifist and fight for your silo
---
My friend and I are both Level 200+, and we'd be willing to give you a trial run!

We've mostly been trying to help newer players coming back to the game, by giving them some good legendaries, help powerlevel them, etc
---
Have a nice day.
---
Well, I play both tbh. But mainly asking for my melee toon.
---
It‚Äôs like asking why does a car dealership sell parts for 3x the price you can find it for online. 
---
Some people want to sell things fast, like yourself. Others don‚Äôt care how long it takes as long as they get the price they want.
---
I like the build and character backstory, but one thing you can be a little more efficient in is the Barbarian and Ironclad Perks. Both give DR/ER which when combined with armor, result in diminishing returns. Especially if you‚Äôre going to use Psycho/Fury. I suggest going to Dodgy in Agility and Serendipity in Luck if you want more effective tankiness in your build.
---
same thing happened last meat week the primal cuts events seem to replace it for the moment
---
Ah yes of course..
---
And here we are just wanting to turn Purified Water into Boiled Water...
---
Thanks, 
---
Happy Halloween!
---
They are out there but have more then likely been reduced to next to nothing. I'm guessing because of the guaranteed 3 star enemy. Kinda sucks it was fun to spawn into a mire bunker and get mauled by 15 angry crabs.
---
No, as posted above it‚Äôs due to meat week
---
Not to be rude but I forgot fallouts on ps4
---
Bloodboogs are vampiric, every time they attack you they heal, also shotguns have a bug where if your first shot is greater than the enemies defenses it is voided
---
Thank you, I'll post a video walk through in the next few days for everybody that won't get the chance to visit it.
---
I am not sure but I think you commented to the wrong post? Did you mean to comment to OP?
---
That stupid immortal bug can even open doors. When I realized he was unkillable, I shut him in a room only to have him open the door and come after me again. Add that to the floor sliding ghouls that use the Brotherhood Elevators, and it's pretty clear that Fort Defiance is haunted.
---
I admit I‚Äôve been too chicken to give it a try!
---
Indiana! at least were not Illinois!
---
i really wish you were on xbox i find these tamable creatures all the time and make posts about them but no one ever wants to tame one of them but then i see these posts all the time about people struggling with it
---
No one is going ‚Äúfight‚Äù another for a silo. End of the day if someone does the work to launch let them launch. There‚Äôs zero need to take it. 
---
Majority of the game is pve. Pvp only matters when people want it to matter.
---
welcome to f76 pal hope you like your stay here
---
Foolish non-believers, so unenlightened.
---
There is a pretty good chance for one of the critters in that place to be un killable.
---
2 times i have ran way from it and eventually it turned into a legendary. Both times for me it was glowing mole rat and took few minutes to turn.
---
I‚Äôm on PC user is Klepto_Maniac .... holla
---
This is why I love the event. Sad I missed double xp
---
Badass
---
Sweet! I look forward to it üòÑ
---
People using it for xp and farming then crying about being killed is what got survival nerfed to death . Literally to death
---
At the least they should apply to all weapons in a category like rifles, heavy weapons, pistols, etc.    
---
But yeah I'd like to buy more skins as items with skins are not scrippable and you get a warning before dropping them even if they are not favorited.  But I can't really justify the purchase price for 1 gun at a time.
---
Well the problem here is also I used my powerfist and it did no damage, I used a Gauss Rifle to critical hit it, threw some plasma grenades. I don't quite understand how it was still able to strike and heal me
---
My team has recently started prepping because when you run tons, it just makes sense. Why do one at a time and have the downtime in between runs when you can run three at once lock them down with  keycards  and essentially kill three queens in roughly 30 minutes. 
---
After each drop servers get more laggy so if you run all three silos at the same time you don't have to deal with added lag after each queen is killed.
---
Only ever had one person try this, they didnt knwo weekly codes so left.
---
I solo them regularly, and would guess they take about 20 min, even less with have cores made beforehand from previous runs. Longest part is the end where you need gauge to fill from robots.
---
Until if and when changes are made, you can combat this a couple ways.
---
-sneak, so you are not visable on map.
---
-keep doing until you memorize quickest path(lots of rooms are uneccassary)
---
-minimize time spent using hacking and picking locks to the meltdown room to bypass that part. (Just killing turrets is easier than wasting time hacking)
---
-ignore turrets when you can.(plus alive turrets will prob slow down poacher)
---
-keep some disable core and repair at your camp prior to next run to save time.
---
- if newly 50 or undergeared bring enough stims and buy some cheap troubleshooter legendaries.
---
no shit there's no need to take it, but people are going to be assholes, and any "fix" for this problem is just going to end up causing other issues, it sucks, I personally hate that another player can erase hours of your time and effort, but this isn't a PvE game, it's also not a PvP game, but it's not just a PvE game so don't be surprised when someone wants to PvP.  and why wouldn't someone fight for their silo?  as mentioned it's a time and resource dump, so why not fight for it?
---
Some people are so creative...and then there are those who eat you...:P
---
I think it was the first time on that character. But, I did get the notification to do the quest a second time, haven't taken the opportunity yet.
---
Lol I‚Äôve met lots of them.
---
You can display them now?!
---
Well I appreciate the support!
---
Because they can...but it doesnt mean we have to buy it! I refuse to pay crazy prices... Hell I wont even pay more than 1 cap per 5.56 round. You can charge it but Im not going to pay it.....
---
I play with an Instigating Lever Action with 25% Faster Fire Rate. I put a hardened reciever and a silencer on it along with sneak rank 3 and I can 1 shot most enemies.
---
I am also a Bloodied Build
---
I have noticed lately that my first shot or two doesn't do anything, could be a combination of that bug, the shotgun bug, and the Bloodbug's vampiric ability
---
Happy Halloween!  Yeah, October is always a busy time for me.  If you're interested, you can check out some of the weird stuff I do here: [https://www.youtube.com/user/CREATUREFEATUREMUSIC](https://www.youtube.com/user/CREATUREFEATUREMUSIC)
---
Good points.
---
You can always make Bloodied more difficult on yourself.  Try using light armor, or run around in Wood Armor.
---
It's the reason why my character is half-naked.  I'd be pretty unstoppable if I had a full set of Combat Armor.  I choose not to.
---
no the tick damage is 4.. you can get it up to 5 if the other person is using enpath  and they take the extra damage(33damage taken). havent tested if it raises with pycho but it should i think. it dosent matter that mutch since it dosent have a cap its what it makes it op. but it should be like that. it takes you a month to farm it . and you cant use leg effects from armor. . i say its in a fine place. 
---
btw if you use a towshot explosive combat shotgun it breaks the armor. you get double the stacks from twoshot and explosive.
---
not storage budget, C.A.M.P. budget
---
Whatever dick. Dont come near my camp
---
So? It's instanced; you can enter the same silo and go on your merry way without seeing the farmer/afk'er.
---
I didn't think I was being condescending, but ok - my bad. I certainly didn't mean to be. I love theorycrafting and I probably am a bit of a min-maxer, but I didn't think I was agressive about it. 
---
On the other hand, though, if you put your build out on a forum like this, I think it's fair enough to be criticised. Isn't that the point of posting? If you want to post non-meta, then fine. Nobody has an issue with that, but the way the OP posted it...I mean. A link. Nothing else? It was up for critique, and I did. OP should take his lumps like the rest of us here on reddit.
---
And yes, the alcohol bonus is good, which is why I said to go +4 or +7. I am sure I was clear.
---
yes first thing i did when they gave us the display cases
---
do them all, there's not that many...
---
It's actually a really nice weapon I have a Quad that melts enemies.
---
Do you need to learn the plan for it or buy it in the Atom shop?  I have very little plans despite being level 51
---
I don't know, the base price is 41 caps but it is rare enough to make me desperate, but it also has -2 PER and protection from hazards and diseases in the air mmmmhh ... I can offer 300 caps (I don't know if it's a reasonable offer but I'm desperate)
---
Why does noone put them in order!!!!!!
---
no it's free when you go to your build menu there is a new category called "displays"
---
Developing a game in 2019 is now considered on par with some of the most stressful jobs on the market.
---
The industry has quickly moved from a small fraction of the population to a world wide hobby.  Old games that where 5mb big and costed a few hundred bucks to make is not an option (unless you made a rogue like indie game then people jizz their pants at that).
---
The cost games has stayed at $60 for a while.  Growing up, a game lasted about 8 hours normally then any time after was usually due to lack of other games or simple 90‚Äôs kids not being entitled.
---
God of War for example, the new one, lasts about 12 hours.  Good reviews, did what it needed to do now no one talks about it.  What makes it better than Fallout 76?  Why can someone play fo76 for 200 hours and say it is bad but only 12 on another game and say its great?
---
Fallout 76 has issues, every game has issues.  If there was a game without issues, we would all probably be on that subreddit praising them for a job well done.
---
handle checks out
---
So making people fight to claim dominance over a silo is a deterrent to stopping silo sniping?   No sorry that‚Äôs not going to do jack. Most of the people have had time, caps, and whatever to Madre craft their builds, get access to the best weapons and gear money can buy and that‚Äôs the solution?  Even if damage is capped at 110 that isn‚Äôt going to fix anything but open more pvp options.
---
Well damn I need to check that out. I just played this weekend for the first time in months, so I‚Äôm way behind in all things FO 76
---
So bummed.
---
At least it would require pretty specific timing on the poacher's part to slip in before the doors closed, unlike how it is right now where they can basically enter at any time.  And if they do get in, they are a known quantity.  It's not like someone slipping in through the back door when the lights dim, or camping out next to the key slot while you deal with the robots.  I think you'd be able to notice them in the huge amounts of downtime between waves.
---
Yep mine has been bugged since I first realized I had it. Very annoying as I prefer it to the wild flailing of the wave emote.
---
Yea that, lol my bad..
---
Its whatever they feel the value is ..if you dont like it simply move on... maybe theyll negotiate if you really want it ..if not find it somewhere else with a price you feel is fair
---
Exactly! And you could run all the way to the other side and he'll still follow you. Even one of the ghouls turned to kill it and it couldn't
---
well im gonna tell you ..that finding normal pets dogs, cats, ect (that are tamable) ...are much rarer then finding deathclaws , sloths things like that so good luck on your search..out of my 1900 hours i have found 1 cat and 2 dogs that were tamable and a billion of the other creatures
---
But why give that option in the first place?
---
Imagine being so insecure you have to rip on other people's happiness to feel a slight boost in yours. Now THAT is sad.
---
This is so sad, alexa play despacito
---
Where should I lvl tho
---
what are you talking about?  I'm not suggesting *ANY* changes, you can already PvP inside the silo, if someone is coming to take the silo you are in the literal best option we have, RIGHT NOW, is to fight for it.  locking other players out of a portion of the map for *any* amount of time is bullshit and only going to cause trolls to lock out all the silos on a map a half hour at a time
---
You might not but I can get 2 caps per 5.56 round all day long.
---
Hey more power to you!
---
Bloodied can still be tricky. Yes you can one hit most things with sneak but it is not easy mode when 5 or 6 charred are mauling you in a tight space or when you get one hit by a mirelurk queen over and over. If we're level 100+ I think we should be one hitting level 68 supermutants
---
That's how it works, exactly. Wish we could set it to both. Area and team mates, local or distant
---
If you go far enough you'll end up in the actual atomic shop itself!
---
But then what determines if it can be launched or not? If it‚Äôs just on a timer but you can‚Äôt see the other person you could still take them from people taking 30+ minutes to launch.
---
Here's what you do:
---
You don't say a word.  Instead, you casually make your way to the Cranberry Bog.  You aggro a Scorchbeast.  Or two.  Or three.  See who leaves first. üòÇ
---
Also A good chunk of people are playing alts to power level them with the meat week events. I have also had a few guys tell me they had their camps off so they didnt get lagged out doing the events with people going ham in their machines. I def noticed a lot of fullish servers on ps4 over the weekend, 20ish players, and like only 3 to 5 vendor camps on those servers.
---
Last year I was invited to join an xb1 lobby group but they turned out to exploit pvp, wreck camps, and steal junk bags. I was afraid to leave and when I did sure enough they attacked me and my camp often. 
---
Reporting does nothing. Just like irl you have to make something up like you need to take care of a sick uncle so you won't be able to play the game. Then block whomever pvp's you.
---
*Just now someone showed up at my adventure mode camp and vs emotes me. Posting here is just advertising for trouble.
---
Maybe you can predict the future in your dreams. Bethesda has to see this! 
---
A 'craft X amount/all' option would be a really nice QoL improvement
---
because doing so would be tedius. it's easier to just open the menu and deposit the ones you're carrying.
---
plus outside the first first seven being the SPECIAL ones, i don't think most would care to know what the proper order even is.
---
How dare you insult Lampboi
---
Nice presentation but the image of the perk cards doesn't match the description.  As an example you have demo expert in the image, but the description seems to indicate it should be makeshift warrior
---
You can buy them somewhere for 8k caps??
---
Totally may have, apologies if so.
---
It literally two-shots targets that it cannot one-shot. Saying its fine in PvP because you have to grind for it for a month is like saying everything else but what you play with should be removed because you played it last year - irrelevant.
---
Either item is balanced in competition, or its not. This particular armor set removes the validity of all previous playstyles that are not based upon it. It literally obsoletes all existing legendaries. No way it is anywhere near the right place until the total poison damage obtained from a single shot (not hit) is reduced to 10 true damage.
---
Why would it matter? You can - in theory - launch a missile simultaneously from Alpha, Beta, or Charlie. (I mean, one player couldn't, but the server could have 2-3 missiles in flight.) No reason you can't launch two from the same silo at the same time.
---
I personally don't like the idea of having it timed and locking everyone out. I have soloed the silos a few times and The last thing I would want is a timer ticking down while I stealth through and take out all those assaultrons. A timer also would punish new players who don't know their way around the silos. But there's no reason they couldn't have the missile firing locked for a period of time to the person who first got in. Just make it tied to the ID that you have to create at the beginning to deactivate the security grid. Make is so once an ID is used to deactivate security, that ID is locked in for a period of time and only they are allowed to fire the missile. If they run out of time, there could be a way to extend it by putting your badge into another computer. That way it won't get locked up by a player unless they are actually in the silo running it, but it also won't lock others from coming in and helping out.
---
I do like the idea of having a readout over the silo like they have for events, but it could only be done if there was a failsafe. Right now, it's better to do the silos while crouching so no one knows you are doing them.
---
I'm selling one of these if anyone is interested on ps4
---
Yep, happened to me all last night. At one point it dropped on a guy's camp while I was checking his vendors. Made accessing them a nuisance.
---
Lets hop it's not from Quebec!
---
 I can offer 300 caps (I don't know if it's a reasonable offer but I'm desperate) 
---
due to the unavailability of it now, it's become much, much more expensive. it's in the 4 digits. i've heard it can go into 5
---
WHO LOVES MEAT WEEK?...HUMANS!
---
WHO ELSE LOVES MEAT WEEK?....GRAHAM!
---
WHO DOESNT LOVE MEAT WEEK?.....this guy...
---
Yeah right seems like an opportunity they will miss the boat on if mods come to the servers.
---
Just out of curiosity what benefit is there to wearing the excavator armour?
---
?
---
I dont play borderland, really only play fallout 76
---
go to a train station and check the three posters on the bulletin board. it unlocks the Nukashine quest, the Lying Lowe quest, and the Pioneer Scouts quest, which were all added post-launch. there's also the Mistress of Mystery questline if you haven't found that one, to start it you gotta find a corpse wearing a black and green dress. they're all over the lower part of the map, so just keep an eye out (i think there's one near the amusement park if you need help). otherwise, there's the daily quests you can repeat every 20 hours. some of those are fun to do.
---
I get this occasionally and agree, it's confusing for new players.  
---
I think the audio sync bug is worse as far as gameplay. There's been tons of times I hear an enemy talk and then make their death sound several seconds after I've dispatched them. I always think there's an enemy I missed right behind me until the death sound comes in.
---
Why can't they be launched simultaneously? You can launch from Alpha/Beta/Charlie in parallel, so why not from Alpha?
---
I know there's a three(?) hour lockout once a silo is used, but they might need to change that thinking if they used an instanced model.
---
I'm just proposing alternatives. I think a 30 minute window to launch a nuke is problematic for people who like to take their time or work slowly.
---
Capitalism
---
Mine black screened when I opened a note in my inventory, couldn't bring up task manager even though it was set to always in front. Had to log off and back in to Windows.
---
Um, there's plenty of reasons why you can't.  The servers can barely handle a trio of blasts.  Now every user gets their own personal nuke?  Potentially 24 different blast zones on the map?  That's not going to end well.
---
Just completed at first try today i think i should upload the clip.
---
I've read that players are having problems with apply some skins, I know it used to work for me when I had combat armor, made switch to all scout armor (wish the had skins for that) another post and time. I know the camo on my x01 is still applied.
---
That price seems fair,
---
I'm likely an outlier, but I'm waiting to buy 76 until there is a private server option. It's the entire reason I follow this sub.
---
Mostly because I'm on console, and refuse to pay to play multiplayer games. With any luck private servers will open up the possibility to play single player, negating the requirement for PS Plus. 
---
The other reason is that I don't see other folks being in game really adding to my experience. If I were on PC I could see the argument for PVP, but as it stands pvp isn't in a form that I'd like to consume. 
---
Pete had said here was a possibility for private servers come November back before launch. I'm not at all sure how that timeline has progressed.
---
Congratulations to both of you!  How sweet and creative... May your hearts grow together for many more years.
---
(But not literally due to radiation.  I don't advise that.)
---
Honestly, it's not worth hunting specific weapons until you are level 50. Level 50 is the max for weapon levels and once you hit it, you're not going to want to be using a level 35 legendary. Before level 50, you're better off just running with the best you can get of the weapon type you use and then when you hit 50, just grind or shop player vendors for the specific legendary you want.
---
Really? That's kind of a bummer.
---
It's probably better that way! I mean, I would never have seen your PSN if you were dead. Keep your head down, friend!
---
Well I worry when private servers come in bethesda might loose interest because if mods are allowed they will always beat them to the table and why buy something when they can download for free? I guess we will see
---
yeah, i got that. though i didn't realize it was "invisible" because sometimes the atom shop takes a while to load the images. i just saw "free" and snagged it.
---
still confused about it. meh, i prefer the patriot salute anyway.
---
Because the only other option involves locking everyone else out, and I don't think that's viable for the reasons I mention above.
---
People selling Purified Water for 20c each, I always laugh when I see this kind of thing
---
They should still be popping up as usual! I'll keep an eye out for more reports of this, though.
---
Yeah that is the best thing it saved me a few times
---

---
 &gt; They should still be popping up as usual! I'll keep an eye out for more reports of this, though.
---
So does me being in the minority invalidate my opinions and make me worth not listening to?
---
&gt;my solution is turn off pacifist and fight for your silo
---
Except, if the poacher doesn't, there's nothing you can do about it.
---
And if it were forced off, you can bet the problem would be even worse, with poachers steamrolling everyone with their pay-to-win explosive junk the moment the prep ended.
---
As you already said - the current way really is the best way.
---
What‚Äôs more concerning is that picture
---
I've read around here that it seems to be server dependent. If your getting similar drops with stats you don't want, jump servers and it should change up. I honestly don't know how accurate this is, though.
---
i mean i dump any that i don't expect to use/listen to in my stash. same with notes. but yeah the overseer ones you CAN'T dump, either by dropped or stash, because technically the quest they're required for "isn't completed".
---
It‚Äôs when I‚Äôm stuck spamming the A button endlessly during crafting that I seriously think most often, ‚ÄúWhat am I doing with my life..?
---
Bethesda might want to consider this..
---
All Rise (Legendary rocket sledge hammer, lvl 50, 150 dmg)

---
Congratulations!
---
why are you even on this sub if you hate it so much
---
Michiganders uniteeeeee
---
Honesty I am a huge single player fan but I made the leap and really if feel like it is single player, I really dont have a lot of interactions with other player. The cool part about have other player on ur server us they can buy stuff from u and u can buy stuff from them. It really is the only reason I have such great gear. I cant tell u how many times I've killed 3 star legendaries and got poop stuff. And u shop around, u will always find someone selling what u want cheap. I wouldn't wait jump on get ur toes in the water and see if u like it. If ur on ps4 join me and I will be happy to make u great gear to start out with and we can even team up. Let me know
---
I am sure I did not say that.   
---
 The game already has object limits.   
---
For example you can only place 3 greenhouse domes. so because it is a ATOM item it should not cost budget, This is what I am implying.   
---
I NEVER said anything about nuffing the existing placement limits.   
---
maybe a pop-up book would be more your speed. :)
---
I aswell but i play 76 and ESO
---
Outside of Fissure Site Prime during an SBQ battle, I'm convinced that the Pumpkin House is the most dangerous area of the whole map.
---
It's not just the Scorchbeast that's reliably there.  It's also the high-leveled Super Mutants, Scorched, Deathclaws, often Fog Crawlers too.
---
If you can survive that area, you can survive anything.
---
Are you selling water or chems? You can get a bunch of caps off diluting chems.
---
Good catch. That‚Äôs one I switch in and out depending on the situation. Made the update.
---
no this same thing happend last meat week as well they were not here at all during it
---

---
yeah, didn't think if the invader had pacifist on...  well I guess sometimes you just have to eat a shit sandwich...
---
We're not talking about preserved pie for 10k, are we? Some things are clearly a joke.
---
Sometimes people overprice and have a sign to make an offer. Then they can sell those ammo at 1c each instead of 0.9c after tax.
---
I overprice all my weapons and armor in my machine as a way of tagging items I don't want and can safely scrip when the next purveyor sale comes around. Oddly enough some of it sells occasionally.
---
So you want an OP build but don't want to be OP?
---
They're all coming for that one pie left in the oven.
---
Some might be relying on the default prices, which are often exorbitant (especially for ammo).  Or they may not realize that's 10 caps *per Fusion Cell* instead of the whole batch.
---
Montykoro Here! I play like a BOS Paladin... if you like that role.. please add me and i show the wasteland.
---
That is a nice weapon even though the glith, though. Have the devs fixed the drum mag yet?
---
If we look hard enough, perhaps we might find one with a Vault Tec logo, the Mysterious Stranger, or Vault Boy!
---
Those games you listed also have way more people playing them so I think that has a lot to do with it.
---
Dumb question: this isn't your mule account, is it? I thought I lost all my shit once and proceeded to lose my shit IRL until my wife told me to calm down Anakin.
---
I've got a group, but they aren't always on, plus one of them's a low level who's also a kid and therefore thinks they can take on the world, when in reality, they're only alive because we carried them and spent all our stimpak on ourselves making sure they stayed alive (and good luck getting stimmed by the kid when you're down because they don't save resources at all). So, for now, the quest sits unfinished on my Pipboy. When I'm a high enough level to do Encryptid in a team and also carry the kid without spending all my stims, I'll probably try again.
---
Nope it's my main. About a week or so since the last login and I've been reset to the beginning of a quest that I finished. Sucks.
---
It is worth between 5-10k
---
My pets judge people based on appearance all the time. Especially hats an beards ;)
---
Which one ? And are you sure you completed it ?
---
I play on PC, but with an XB1 controller, and this happens to me ALL THE TIME. I'm in the middle of some epic smackdown and suddenly, PIP BOY! I'm being swarmed and shot at, and everything is going wrong, but my pip boy needs to remind me that I have snot ear. Again? Still? Who knows, but it's not what's about to kill me!!
---
100% agree. I play berserker and this build needs seriously an up.
---
never heard of it.
---
If your on Ps4 I will gladly buy all your 5.56 rounds for under a cap each how much for 20,000 rounds.
---
The brotherhood transponder quest with the scorch beast. I know for a fact that I've been reset, don't have proof that I've completed it but I shouldn't have to, Bethesda shouldn't of reset me in the first place I guess.
---
broken armor should auto unequip, it's a bug, not a feature, and people need to stop treating it as such
---
In my personal opinion; *every* play build needs a buff **minus** Bloodied. Bring all of the builds up to par, so that every build is worthy enough to play... because right now... not very many builds are very reliable end game, and the others could use a decent uptick to *at least* come within 75% of what a full out bloodied build can do.
---
.... alphabetical
---
We learned from Bethesda's Atom Shop. Complain to them.
---
I keep all the holo tapes dew to the story behind them, same with the notes.
---
solar/thorns sets for standard armor.  i cant speak for thorns but solar is pretty great with the heal effects for non-bloodied.  i can do queens without using any stim and it outheals the sonic attack, i use very little stims in the raid.  (im working on eventually a vanguard due to the self heal and high vanguard resistances)
---
there is also the expert mask which is more of a bragging right than useful.
---
Damn congratulations! I still need two, and it's a giant pain haha
---
I have all those ones i can drop in my stash though. I just wanna stuff the over seer ones in my stash as well
---
oh, i think i cannot buy it at these prices...
---
Then you wwouldmt get your legendary effects
---
I've completed it 4 times now! Out of 11 attempts...
---
One of the completions was due to scorched and a scorchbeast killing half the enemies before we even saw them
---
I dump mines in my stash. So I dont have an amy or holos on my person.
---
I prefer the horde events over the meat week.
---
and about the unavailbility, i know only now...
---
exactly, the armor is broken, it shouldn't work
---
I, too, keep a legendary shovel. Mine is on a display at my camp. I'm sure people wonder why I have a shovel on display, but I run back and grab it before I go off to bury that "soldier". After freaking out because it had happened to me AGAIN, one of my friends handed off a three star shovel to me. I will keep it forever.
---
Agreed. The fog crawlers left to go fight the mirelurk queen in the glades.
---
Building around a theme can help inspire you and make things feel planned. Build an actual farm with the barn plans, rows of crops, and rustic wood furniture. Or make a Garden of Eden using the astroturf and potted plants, with a garden shack for your bed and essentials. Or build a warehouse. Or build a raider home. Or build a junkyard. Or build a church to the mothman. Having atoms to spend helps, but you can get quite a bit of mileage out of the plans you find in-game.
---
that's just a lot of clutter, I used to feel bad dropping someone's story, then I realized you can read notes and not pick them up, even quest items only need to be read, albeit there are some that need to be looted
---
well there is no tenderizer plan unfortunately , but just RNG on the rest
---
I shot one with my explosive laser and it was literally one more shot from dying no matter what the gun, next time I pull the trigger it just disappears and my shot just went behind to the tree that was behind him. Honestly I‚Äôm kinda glad I didn‚Äôt kill him. He let me take pics and that‚Äôs how I repaid him. Makes me feel kinda bad lol.
---
PS4 player here and I stopped playing for a while.  Comes down to the fact that 76 is stagnant coupled with the fact that there's other really good games to play lately.
---
They never added tenderizer plans to 76 period thats just a pipe dream atm.i got the tenderizer yesterday aswell as the rocket firework and the salt mod
---
Now I'm imagining pet battles, pokemon style. Wouldn't that be awesome. :)
---
This isn't an Xbox exclusive issue.
---
Save budget when building so you have more for decor:
---
* When building, all existing generators take the same 0.33~% of camp budget. So building one fusion generator to run your camp saves you a lot of budget over 4 or 5 small generators.
---
* If you have separate buildings (I like to build neighborhoods), use street lights instead of power connectors to jump between buildings - you get both the relay of power and the light provided instead of placing two separate items and using more budget.
---
* Mobs are attracted to noise and crops, so placing your crops and water purifiers away from your structure draws them away from damaging your buildings if they do attack.
---
* Camps produce purified water based on the strongest purifier, not the total of purifiers. So if you put 3 small purifiers your camp produces 12 cans of purified water per hour. Replacing one with a large purifier (if you have a water source) you get 60 cans of purified water per hour instead.
---
Thing with no name is always cave crickets for me.
---
ok, thanks, I actually might look into that, I am building a high endurance tank right now with Vanguard as my legendary effect choice, so it heals even in combat?  then I wouldn't need healing factor...
---
I wanna make a little town with fellow ex dwellers where we make "Little 76; home away from home"
---
And no im not selling till after event ends :p
---
nicely done!
---
In my opinion the real Mothman has yet to be seen. The ones we have now are only his children.
---
Losing all armor legendary effects would make a Berserker buff all the more legitimate.
---
Because that's not how map terrain works on that engine sadly
---
Make it float.
---
Well, there‚Äôs at least 4 of us. NE SD here.
---
Idk whats up with urs but i turned my quests off a few months bk just turned the brother hood of steel bk on and nothing changed for mine no reset or anything.
---
Yep, it's supply _and_ demand. If it's easy for me to get, rather niche, or something I don't really use, I price it cheap to move. Things always in demand (screws, 5.56, etc) I price a little higher, but not outrageously so, and it still moves. Legendaries obviously depend on effects. Crappy ones get traded for scrip, everything else that's not a godroll still gets listed pretty cheaply. I find enough that I don't particularly care to sit on a bunch of them for too long.
---
I don't have an issue with the players I've seen selling 10 cap/round .38 ammo or 10k 1 star low level legendaries. That's on them to figure out why no one's buying and making vomit emotes.
---
oh yeah, Berserker def needs a buff, but the broken armor bug also needs to be fixed
---
There is a list of quests and events [here](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_quests%23Side_quests) (not sure how complete this is, not all events that I have seen in the game are listed, but most should be there). If you did not play these already, I recommend the Order of Mysteries and the Lying Lowe quest lines.
---
I honestly love the content but just think the prices are way too high.  If you bought a kit every week for a month that's like $75 a month.  That's insane compared to dlcs for other games.  PA and outfits should be $5 at most.  Would love to see them closer to $3 ea with occasional $1 deals.
---
Flip side to this is I dont think that would increase the amount of stuff purchased by a large enough margin to make said changes profitable for Beth.  Microtransactions are always kept afloat by whales and they won't care if its $50 a skin.
---
Be quiet Todd.
---
For what it's worth, I have only seen him in pictures on the internet and that my husband snapped one day while I was at work... And I am probably at about 350 hours, as well. We're just the lucky ones...
---
Damn, I thought it‚Äôd be easier bc it‚Äôs smaller.. I guess I‚Äôll try to find a sloth then
---
Got it. It is borderline unusable in PVE due to the stuttering, but my harpoon now does wreck all those SentAss teslaboys, which is glorious.
---
It will be patched out for sure, but until then I see it as a way of leveling field in PvP.
---
The only one star worth taking would be a bloodied one. I like when people try to lie to themselves to validate their already wrong oppinion. My first good legendary was a duped 2 shot explosive that shot the same range as my 50 cal and while ads the shots are exactly the same *almost* every single time. Not much times where I‚Äôm not ads‚Äôing tbh. But you‚Äôre right that when you‚Äôre hip firing it‚Äôs godawful inaccurate. Especially the gat-gun since the bullets end up like 10 feet apart when hip firing lmao
---
I didn't even know it was a thing, but I finally got one this round.
---
Meat week just like Fasnacht...
---
Should be just as good as bloodied build, really makes me wonder what their rational was for the huge bloodied bonus compared to berserkers!
---
I think thats what Im gonna do.
---
So.. you popped the key card in, and somebody else was still able to  launch?  Did you enter the wrong code?  It shouldn't have let them do it if you got to the receptacle first.
---
Try not to build floating anything, even if there is nothing in it  1 foundation and some walls ‚Äúhelping ‚Äú to hold up a structure looks better than a staircase
---
Red dead has this. You can put about 20 markers or so. Can‚Äôt label them though. Really great feature for special locations or farms.
---
I bet your stuff moves FAST, though. I have been thinking I might just start doing a "Dollar-ammo" or a Two Cap Store. Nice and inexpensive. It's the way to keep things moving!
---
Only 10k? They're doing it wrong.
---
I've been seeing them on Xbox just like normal.
---
Tbh I never even logged in for it. At this point I‚Äôm just finding new games to pass my time until wastelanders drops. Ever since the event change I haven‚Äôt really had shit to do and I already didn‚Äôt have shit to do before that.
---
And marine ;)
---
Perhaps they mistake a fusion cell with a fusion core?
---
I wish this did work, so I knew who to grief into fucking oblivion.
---
They did, with armor at least.  
---
See Vault 94
---
So basically this flops whole PvP into unusable state to the point they had to deactivate survival not to make this a PR crisis "this is how Beth balances stuff", AND simultaneously sucks in PvE?
---
This shit needs a fix in every possible aspect lol.
---
I just cackled. And then upvoted and laughed some more.
---
I've got 2 of them so far
---
I'm not convinced they even spawn when they should in the Bog. Last one I did, the final wave started with only 55 seconds left. I didn't get a marker for the Behemoth (which of course was a legendary) until there was only 10 seconds left. I couldn't even get to him before it failed.
---
Scorchbeasts really fuck up the enemy spawns there too I've noticed, particularly when there are multiple.
---
My dog doesn't like black people. üòß
---
I've very rarely seen similar things but they always resolved themselves by reloading the game.  It's as if occasionally the server and client don't fully sync up but then next time it tries it works itself out.
---
They are supposedly going to be doing that with wastelanders. Rifle Gaming put out a video a while back from a data mine that shows the new effects they are allegedly going to add. 
---
Here‚Äôs the link to the video:

Congratulations! üéâüéâüéâüéâ Here's hoping to see what fallout wedding theme you do üòÇüíúüòâ
---
ok good to know ty
---
I also had problems with this quest resetting. It seems like you had to start it and complete the full quest without logging out or getting kicked from the server. This happened to me more than once. First time attempting it I got kicked, rejoin to see that I had to start over from the start. Well I thought it was just a bug, went through half the quest again to log out halfway for whatever reason to log in again at a later date and dont you know I had to restart it once again!
---
&gt; NW can barely get 30 players in a match.
---
On PC perhaps, but on console, matches are consistently full. The only time I see fewer than 52 or have to wait a minute or two to find a match is during off-hours, like very late at night or middle of the day when people are at work/school.
---
ok ty was just making sure
---
I'll give it a restart. Pretty annoying regardless.
---
So existing fridge limit = 10, you said wouldn't be able to. Therefore you're suggesting nerf. We can argue semantics all day long, in the end your unoriginal idea that has been explained as a terrible idea for stability issues on a billion different posts is a terrible,  stupid, moronic and nonsensical. The game already has stability issues and you want to just set the servers on fire.
---
That is because each silo activates it‚Äôs own animation on the world map. You can stand a watch the nukes launch from the outside. That‚Äôs why they have individual cool downs.
---
Annoying because I'd like to play the game but I dont want to finish quests twice.
---
Could we maybe try something new in the franchise instead of BoS, Enclave, and Super Mutants though? I love them don't get me wrong, but I think with 76 we have the full story of them now. There's very little else to say with those characters about the world. New York is a town built by immigrants, what if a group of people turn up from a different country trying to escape whatever apocalypse they faced with the US once again being promised as a New World. 
---
Tell a story allegorical of Native Americans seeing Europeans arrive for the first time.
---
There was a list circulating about a month ago showing some new legendary attributes found in the code that haven‚Äôt been unlocked yet. I agree we‚Äôre due for new effects to chase.
---
Hell I'd even take that at a bare minimum.
---
May your marriage have one thousand less bugs than a Bethesda game.
---
Congrats. I need 3 more to complete mine
---
This just made me laugh. I used to have a neighbor who hated squirrels (he kept a garden). I think he would have liked your approach...
---
I have been missing more often with my shotgun and pistol, as well, so I wonder if it's just a general VATS thing...
---
new weapons are coming. I'm particularly interested in the heavy ones now that energy ap is a thing.
---
no need for new effects, really. just fix the existing ones. berserker's is a great idea on paper but essentially broken. lots of effects are useless and need to be buffed. would be great if they removed creature-specific ones from the pool, too. all they do is dilute the rng.
---
I'm also pretty sure level 50 BSS drills would absolutely decimate everything in the game, so the real reason why they can't be legendary/max level is to keep their power in check.
---
The Meat Tenderizer plan, Super Mutant Grill, and Super Mutant BBQ Grill plans are all in the game files, but none of them can drop. Whether that will change is yet to be seen.
---
Isn‚Äôt this what a camp is?
---
This is incorrect. The meat tenderizer plan is in the game files.
---
Could have a bit more to do. Maybe have bounties for specific types of meat required for the cook, ingredient gathering, just more stuff to do between actual cook out. Needs lots more rewords too, like that "Meat gun" people on this sub came up with, more recipes/plans, maybe picnic/BBQ attire, camp items...
---
Very cool!
---
No? A camp only marks one location, and yes you can fast travel to it but I'm just talking about marking multiple locations with a waypoint....
---
It mey be in the game files like alot of other content they have yet to grant us yet no one has got it .  Take a hint
---
tenderizer plans don't exist and the weapon itself is a rare drop. after last meat week i just caved and bought one off a player (out of spite. i told myself i would be done with the event when i won the hammer and i never got it, it was a compulsion at that point). i added the salty mod to it and mounted it on my wall with a sign that says "Old Salty".
---
if i get another one, i'll probably sell it to make my caps back, but i'm not holding my breath, as again, it's a rare drop.
---
Did you complete the quest and it reset from there? I don‚Äôt think there are intermediate checkpoints for this quest when you‚Äôre doing it. Every time I died during my first character‚Äôs run through that quest (I died a lot), I had to go back to the beginning of the quest to restart even if I was still on the same server. It took when I finally finished it, though, and got the transponder.
---
no
---
yes, but it doesn't drop from the event. at the least, nobody's claimed to have gotten it yet. it's probably like the "ultra rare" masks like witch Fasnacht, i bet there's maybe one person who got the plan.
---
Plenty of other games are out, or are coming out. School started 4-6 weeks ago in the States. I've seen many, many more lower level players lately, and that's pretty cool.
---
yeah, GTA V as well
---
Thats why it wont be missed when its gone.
---
Yeah that quest has always reset , I think it‚Äôs on purpose, no clue why.
---
Had you intended to start a religious war? Haha!
---
To be fair, I was actually a little disappointed the first time I saw him. Granted, he's a glorious bastard, but there's nothing 'man' about this 'mothman'. He's just a moth.
---
Personally, I prefer my gods to be benevolent. I refuse to worship someone who tries to kill me when he's having a bad day. That, and I don't want to have to shoot my gods...
---
that's only going to make the effect you want harder to find
---
I‚Äôm 100% okay with that
---
This is one of those things we have to take on faith. lol
---
We tend to not revive people because respawn is quick.  One of us tends to share quack surgeon and another shares team medic which reduces the need for stimpaks.  
---
If you are on Ps4 I might be able to help
---
Census violence has twice the drop chance compared to other eligible events. Though they are still incredibly rare drops which I didn't get until like level 260. Good news is that the mods have a very high learn chance from scrapping so it only took me 30 or so crafts to learn them all.
---
you are literally the only one.  the entire reason for the legendary vendor is because of how ass the rng already is
---
Only for the summer months. I'm in Canada, and I promise, no moth stays for the winter. She takes the kids south for the winter, presumably.
---
Nah, I doubt that  lol
---
My main is melee with rifle as a secondary.  I run full unyielding because the extra bonuses to STR are better than the DR.  IMO the extra damage is worth it.
---
As it stands atleast on xbox one meat week is dead in the water ur lucky to see 2 peeps there anymore as most got board with it already
---
Yes, also I feel like I am doing less damage as well its so weird.
---
So... not god. Just an angel? ;)
---
I made three separate points in my post, which one do you doubt?  because the last two are definitely true, but the first one I suppose was hyperbole
---
Right down to the big, un-lootable club/fire hydrant. We just need some irradiated elephants!
---
I did at +110 level, I was lucky and nobody bothered me
---
I'm one of those people. I was planning on waiting but content has been coming out so slow for Fallout 76 with a lot of it being in the atom shop so I decided to just give up the game for a bit and play other games instead. 
---
I'll probably get back on after wastelanders, but I'm pretty underwhelmed with the game (and live services as a whole) right now. Crazy that we had Fallout 4s full DLC including 2 new maps by this point in it's release cycle.
---
God, I can see why that would cause nightmares...
---
Congratulations and best wishes on your new co-op quest
---
I just want that Tato salad recipe. Got more tenderizers than I have bullets, and my pile of chef outfits and meat cleavers are competing with Graftons Mayor for most annoying thing in the game.
---
The first one obviously, I 100% agree with you on the last two. I‚Äôm just looking for them to spice things up one way or another
---
And woman is a butterfly? ;) Personally, I'm neither. If I could fly, I would be a more fulfilled person.
---
The rate that they spawn seemed to be significantly reduced about 2 months ago. I also haven't seen one since meat week started.
---
If they brought back the ones missing from fallout 4 I'd be happy!
---
Its not a bug its a feature. New game plus from Todd to you :)
---
This is so adorable. Congrats!
---
Personally, I think they're going to be like the Children of Atom. Totally nuts.
---
...After all, we all know Mr. Fuzzy is the REAL god of the wastes. ;P
---
The thorn set adds OK bleed damage I guess? But it's only on melee and if you're running the vaults with melee you're probably killing things before you're gonna notice the bleed effect I say go solar all the way. Also i believe the buggy issue with the power armor is only on PC with certain graphics cards and whatnot.
---
Cats can and will eat moths. Your logic is sound.
---
It shows up at my camp all the time. I captured in between halfwalls once. It stayed there for over an hour.
---
Fish tales. It was thiiiiiis big! ;)
---
I've had a couple on the world map that actually ended up with the target legendary hiding in the Burrows.
---
it heals in and out of combat as long as your above 60% hp, it does 4/s. from a numbers standpoint
---
Probaply was me if you are playing on pc
---
Did you return back to fort defiance and enter Tagertities room to access her computer?  I only ask because a long time ago that quest was bugged and if you didn't fully finish it, it would completely restart.  If you did finish it you should have received a power armor set....it use to show up in your inventory as a power armor frame with 0 weight.  Don't drop/scrap it..it is a nice set.
---
Clearly, they were bitten off.
---
Honestly haven't noticed. Still one-shotting most enemies and never getting hit.
---
This is my new anti-harassment plan! I like your style!
---
Uh...how much do they usually go for?
---
Congratulations. Glad the rain didn't rain on your parade. :)
---
I think some people are just trolling. I‚Äôve seen CAMPs that look like they have a ton of weapons for sale and I get there and it‚Äôs all non legendary level 10 pipes for 10k.
---
lol right!  my ppp's are @ 24999; whatabargain!
---
Dean- ah
---
I rest my case.
---
The first time I saw one in a vendor for about 15c, I almost fell out my chair!
---
Greets from xXDemolisher. i think we met sometimes
---
You get double and multiple ore like the super duper perk by wearing excavator power armor while picking up ore. It is faster than waiting for a resource extractor to load up.
---
No I think they converted pretty quick into think tanks. There may be a few stragglers who weren‚Äôt instantly massacred when everything went to shit though so maybe someone competent and sane can be talked to from big my
---
rng is bad enough without adding more to the pool...
---
This didn't seem to be an issue during the last Meat Week, and the CB Bog Prime Meat Event was my favorite, difficult but doable even solo.
---
This time it has failed more often than not with multiple High level players because of the slow spawn rate and enemy dispersal.
---
same. i've played since beta. had i known, i would've bought up the forest scout mask a long time ago. i've been on the hunt forever now.
---
Yes
---
I completed my bobblehead and magazine stands by purchasing from vendors, however it didnt complete the atom challanges. They seem to only be checked if you find them wild
---
Bethesda is the dealership. Horse armor.
---
It took your card, but you were "halfway through the fights?" Am I missing something?
---
Story of my life. Just hit level 61... and finally bought the steel plan. Personally, I like to combine wood and brick walls. My husband went entirely with the barn walls, but used lots of windows and decor to break it up.
---
Mr Pebbles likes you
---
yeah, there were new legendary effects datamined not long ago, but they aren't instead of what we have, they are for the two other legendary spaces
---
I think this is part of the same problem. The enemies get distracted and if they get too far from the event it just fails because they "escaped".
---
Sorry. I meant to say one hundred billion caps.
---
&lt;dr\_evil.gif&gt;
---
 Just try to build something you have never tried before! Every time I go to a camp to check out the vendors, I do a tour and shop for ideas as much as gear! My last camp was an effort at a split-level house. The roof was easier than expected, but lining the foundations up was a bit more excitement than I had planned on.
---
thanks, yeah I looked it up after and I am def getting a set for my new tank
---
Wtf didnt know that, been doing lucky hole mine and that spot next to it and getting 400+ lead scrap each run, does it matter if a weapons equipped or anything like that or is it simple wear the armour and get a chance at more ore?
---
lol! How many cap mules will I need to pull this off??
---
Tips: Take a lot of stimps with you. maybe get the chemist perk and make a lot of the low tier stimps. Also make sure you have a lot of ammo because i ran out of ammo halfway through.
---
yeah I'm sick of the meta, my first toon is a bloodied melee build, but I have been seeing heavy gun builds lately that just melt stuff, so I am now building a high endurance tank and solar is right up my alley, now I just need a full set of Vanguard solar armor
---
Mr. Pebbles is a benevolent god. He loves us all. Even these silly people who worship a bug. They're just misguided.
---
Superficially.  But the quest rewards aren't as interesting and most of the participants in the BBQ are running around independent of others.  With Fasnacht, you had the parade.  And even though the parade was kind of tedious after the 10th time, the fact that you were doing it *together* made it feel like a proper *community* event over Meat Week.
---
Ok cool thanks I have a few hundred diluted stims I will bank a bit more ammo.
---
Camp budget shouldn‚Äôt have anything to do with it. I had no space left when I tamed my deathclaw. Are you hitting the random spawns found on the random spawn map?
---
Here, I put up a gif of me looking for the plan and finding it, but alas, the plan\\recipe is not attached to any list, which means you cannot get it as a drop as of right now.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/vIN0Hv2](https://imgur.com/a/vIN0Hv2)  
---
 Here is what a proper recipe\\plan looks like, it has a bunch of references - LL meaning "Leveled List"   
---
[https://imgur.com/jFFyS4z](https://imgur.com/jFFyS4z)
---
best of luck, i hope rng treats you more favorable than my luck has been!
---
I prefer when there's nobody there. Less morons standing around doing nothing.
---
I've solo'd the event a few times very easily.
---
Same lol
---
Do you guys use VATS? I am also a shotgunner, and I find I only really have problems with landing a shot when I use VATS, especially if I am trying to use it very quickly.
---
I just did the Mire one solo with 3 minutes to spare. Although it's easier that way because I don't have to hold back.
---
those are the toughest ones.. especially if there are natural spawns around to sidetrack them..
---
25 k from what I‚Äôve seen :o
---
How else can I keep up to date on the latest bugs?
---
for sure, I know I am going to have to grind like crazy for it and spend hella mats, but I NEED that solar Vanguard armor!
---
You've been nothing but disrespectful on the subreddit, and it clearly shows on your profile.
---
How have the mods not banned you yet?!?
---
You mean to tell me bloodbugs can fly AND have opposable thumbs?? Nowhere is safe!
---
I'm only half kidding. That's actually a bit frightening.
---
This is awesome! Congratulations
---
True later on into their build, but what about the knowledge? An individual still needs to have the "plans" for such mods. Some mods are rare and others just take time to unlock. Why not just pay a smith to make me the mods I want, and I'll apply them myself.
---
how do you put up a wall without foundation?
---
the bug occurs outside of VATS, over the last week I have encountered several enemies that don't take damage with the first shot, this is on an alt that is less than level 50 with no damage perks yet, also with various different weapons
---
Tato Salad is some good stuff.
---
It's really two things.  One is that the enemies start very far away and are easily distracted.  Two is the ridiculous amount of time they inserted between waves.
---
Like seriously, "Prepare for the next wave" doesn't need to be an objective.  We're already here.  It's not like we can do anything to "prepare."  Just send them in!  By the time they get to where the players are, there will have been a good 30 seconds of standing around.  There is absolutely no need for another 30 on top of that.
---
This sort of thing cropped up with the Vault Raids as well.  It's almost like they test them on a lag-free server and feel the need to add all these pauses, oblivious to how it actually plays out on the live servers.
---
Im currently doing meat week with 10+ people on xbone.
---
Exp earned will be nerfed, there will be more possible answers on terminals when hacking, durability on average of crafted weaponsand armor will be worse, and learn chance for weapon plans when scrapping will be lower.
---
I usually offset these deficits with class freak perk. If you are crafting any weapon or armor for use, I suggest you get low health and put on an unyielding set and berry mentats for very high intelligence to max the stat out.
---
Saw them last week on xbox myself
---
That's great!
---
Makes total sense. I can see turning your camp off to keep the lag down.
---
Truu. I seemed to have managed them fine in the first MW. Seems this week I‚Äôll be standing around waiting for some enemies or some prime meat reward and I‚Äôll just get a big ol fail for no reason.
---
Are you on PC? Send me a friend request from main menu. Same name as my reddit.
---
They do everything for good pr, lol
---
Were you able to keep the Gauss?
---
i like the implication that garvey being a literal demon is somehow simpler than him simply being a time traveler
---
I missed it, as well, so I am quite happy with the return of Meat Week! I'll 'meat' you there. I'll bring the drinks. ;)
---
Well hating on players is a good way to send them off the game for good. Not everyone  did last meat event or watched vids on how its done. As the old saying goes its better to try with shugar vs salt. Or in ur case its better to teach thoes with less experiance vs having them wander amlessly and make no progress. 76 is about growing a community and working together. There is no need to be hating on anyone.
---
Of course. Thats why the smith makes it. The buyer can apply the mod without any perk restrictions.
---
Yes. PC lvl 90. Speak english and spanish. Thanks
---
Can this replace marsupial or a jet pack? lol
---
I just did it with 3 lvl 100's lol u must be on a better server
---
why does every lfg post have the platform at the end?  it should be in brackets at the *beginning* of the title, like so:
---
\[PC\] LFG
---
you replied to your post, not the person commenting
---
Do you have any of your stable flux displayed?
---
I had a dream I found a level 50 legendary Chainsaw.. then I woke up sad.
---
Yes, and I believe this is something they've formally acknowledged as a "good suggestion" in the past.  Which isn't to say it will happen, but it is something being considered, likely for the same reasons you present.
---
I'll show you. Take a deep breath. Close your eyes. What do you see? That's what you build with. Good luck! :P
---
Stop lying. I know you did.
---
The build limit will say ouch!
---
I dont use it for xp, it's just a nice side benefit. I was only in for the challenge BETHESDA themselves put into the game for this week without considering how broken the pvp server/balancing can be.
---
When private servers come out people will realize Fo76 was not that bad compared to all the servers with rape mods on them.
---
Gram hit me with 1* lvl 50 hunters combat armor right arm. Shit salad +3 cleavers FML
---
Players have noticed that displays can take up a lot of build budget. Just letting you know.
---
I do play pc, I wear a very recognizable suit of power armor. If you.killed anyone with some unique power armor. Then I hate you but only because the dev's allow this kind of thing.
---
if you are talking about Belly of the Beast it doesn't checkpoint, if you are talking about quests not showing up joining a new server fixes it, if you are talking about the on screen log it updates INCREDIBLY slow but will eventually reflect your progress, just did the tourist one and server hopped several times during, took a minute or so for the on screen log to catch up, at first I thought I would have to do each location again, but it caught up
---
Which sucks. Still a fun idea yk
---
Also doesnt the amount of prime meat that you recieve depend on when how quick you finish the event? Yesterday I was at the lower level event because no one was showing up, so I melted through all the waves with close to 3 minutes to spare myself and I only recieved 3 prime meat...
---
yeah, Belly of the Beast doesn't checkpoint, you have to go into glassed cavern on that server
---
Lol thanks- but my camp sucks. By building skills are lacking. I basically have a crappy shack, adhesive farm, junk processor, and a fertilizer Brahmin
---
I'm at work for another 6 hours the I'll be home and online after that.
---
yeah it's not a bug, that quest just doesn't have a checkpoint
---
You need better gear, that's a big part of the problem. Get some caps and hit up player vendors until you get a good 3 star or try the purveyor.
---
Focus on damage perks, can't say much else without seeing the whole build.
---
Wait, was this an atom challenge? 
---
No, seriously, congrats!
---
Having 40 hp is a lot more dangerous than full hp with 0 dr.
---
I'm always so impressed by your build. How current are these pictures? I see you said you filled it in, so I am curious. Every time I see I see your pictures, I feel like something is a little different!
---
How did you get the mole rat to pop out of the toilet?
---
Really? I only get it in VATS. Different systems, maybe? I'm on PC.
---
The outhouse from the atomic shop just does that! I only wish I could put a door on it
---
That‚Äôs why i don‚Äôt use my gamer tag  on reddit. I have heard of a group ( don‚Äôt remember what they call themselves) who is griefers and scammers driving ppl out of the game. Putting hits out on players etc. what a pathetic life they must lead to not be able to just enjoy the game. It‚Äôs sad really. Thanks for the info, I try to stay away from griefers, they suck.
---
My main beefs are that in atom/money terms many items are quite expensive and that sometimes you can‚Äôt get a certain item outside of the bundles (I‚Äôm looking at you wood panel wallpaper!).
---
They don't fix real bugs so they are unlikely to change something that has always been part of the game.
---
Broken Hazmat always worked unless you unequipped.
---
You usually have to sprint to succeed at the event.
---
Im pretry sure the reward amount is based on the area you participate in. Ive always gotten 3 from forest and ash heap and 5 from mire and bog.
---
Which do you still need?
---
Yes, but lending your equipment so the smith can mod it runs the risk of it being stolen or something going wrong. I've heard stories like these before, and I wouldn't want that to happen to anyone.
---
I like this story, reminds me that some of those dudes hanging around on spikes outside the raider locations were toxic sociopaths that learned too late there was a place for them with the raiders.
---
The problem is that they're not mutually exclusive. Sometimes the creative ones are trying to find creative ways to eat you. :( Been to a trap house yet?
---
Mutant should also be reworked to stack with the number of mutations, and either cap it to 50% like junkie or make it go on a bit higher but the trade off is must have class freak off.
---
I don't see the point of adding things to the game without actual use to them. Like the freaking drill. If you're unable to remove it from legendary lists then give it a cooler model, some new stats and the ability to actually become legendary. Otherwise scrap the current drill entirely and make a Power Armor arm weapon mod that looks and works like the Big Daddy's drill, bonus points if it uses oil or fuel as ammo, otherwise the armor's fusion core is cool.
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt say anything, I just rolled on. I don‚Äôt have time me for childish griefers, I‚Äôve got grinding to do. I like the way you think and try that down the road cause I can handle 3 SB at once but they may not lol
---
I know, was just wanting to build my base with and extractor for lead is all.
---
Never seen one. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm actually sad about that or not.
---
also PC, and as I said, it's only been recently, I actually had an encounter similar to OP's with a deathclaw, it wouldn't take any damage at all for a solid minute, but I persevered and eventually it started taking damage, after that I killed it fast
---
It was one of the tougher ones because it required another player to complete it with me.
---
wtf does this even mean
---
I tried to solo the Ash Heap one today. Nobody else showed up, and as I'm a level 85 I thought 'yeah, why not?'. I should've just taken my ass home, because I seriously overestimated my ability to go head-to-head with that sheepsquatch! After tipping an afternoon's worth of lead into it, to very little effect, I cut my losses and fled the scene in great haste, the floor rumbling behind me.
---
Well in FO4 when you replaced a mod you got the one that was equipped to re-use elsewhere if I remember correctly.
---
That was quite nifty
---
Me and a few others managed to unstick the event into finishing by inserting the extract and then running away quickly on foot. Worth a try
---
they might?  but also what the fuck kind of logic is this?  a bug is a bug, who cares whether it was in the game from launch or just introduced?
---
There's a shovel that spawns down the hill from the cemetery. It's next to a toolbox and a toxic pond. You'll pass an obliterated house to get there, very short trip. Also, there's at least two shovels on Deathclaw Island near the safe.
---
 In the "defense" section, there is a frame that you can build, attach a wall, and then delete the frame.
---
A fool and his caps will soon part.....
---
Seriously I think most of it is young players going by suggested price, others are simply showing off stuff knowing that no one will buy it, and the rest are going for the big sell.
---
Since we know you did the composing, how much of this stuff is you? Are you in the finished product? I just grooved on to Grim Grinning Ghosts on repeat for two or three run-throughs. Loving it!
---
I‚Äôd like this feature, but I‚Äôd also like it if you ever scrapped your old camp, you could come back to it and use your resources to rebuild it automatically. Not piece by piece
---
I speak the truth
---
yep
---
try the Free States vendor in the Whitesprings
---
I love your build! It's appropriately spooky, and I LOVE your closed in cornfield. It feels so claustrophobic and perfect!
---
I‚Äôve tossed out several Tenderizers to noobies they just too heavy to try and sell for me anyways.
---
The racial slurs would have been the point of no return for me. I think you did the right thing.
---
Thanks for the suggestion, I'll check it out next time I'm on.
---
&gt;they gave Pc players Mods
---
This is just not true. PC mods for 76 are made by fans and released for the good of the community. Bethesda does not support mods for this game.
---
&gt; BGS has stated a few times that whenever they add something to the game,  something must be removed or altered to maintain "balance". 
---
Source?
---
I‚Äôm keeping it. I figure I‚Äôll start to look for mods now to see what I can do with it. It may be fun for me even though I‚Äôm a big gum build. Thanks for the info.
---
My stash is maxed and player is doubly over encumbered as I can't sell my goods! Good problem to have for us mid and upper-mid levels trying to save for the good plans.
---
I use the one for the pip-boy.  This has me curious enough to check out the Nexus tonight to see if they have one for stashes.
---
Holy spell check, mothman.
---
Mistress of Mystery
---
I thought things had been going pretty well with Meat Weak 2.0 in my experiences until last night, when I was the only one manning drums and the spitfires, picking greens and putting out fires. Everyone else of course was shooting squirrels and wabbits, buncha dang Elmer Fudds. Anyways, yeah that sucked. 
---
I wish sometimes that event awarded based on performance..
---
I honestly don‚Äôt think it is. I run a bloodied build on one of my characters and it‚Äôs ridiculous. I‚Äôm sure you can take a lot more hits with 40hp and 400/500 dr than you can with full health and 0 dr. 
---
I‚Äôd also much rather have 40hp and sentinel powered armor than no armor at all
---
honestly they never should have added them, pooling all the vendor caps was a good enough change, they didn't need to *also* put each factions vendor in the prestigious Whitesprings shops.  especially cos the Free States vendor is in the spa!  it's convenient for sure but not at all lore friendly...
---
A motel isn't too hard either
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdwc229zzYA
---
If you're on ps4, i can just give ya one!
---
Yeah. I noticed the same thing, Wait...whut?
---
I got one as a drop from the Meat Week Events if you feel like giving your luck a go!
---
This was a thing in F4 and I'm pretty sure F3 as well.
---
stable flux from scorched earth (not sure about all stable)  vanishes on death.  they did it because of all the "people stealing my flux" complaints from people dying while looting corpses post event
---
right lets dupe many items then have em disappear when they do a dupe purge but i do agree item prices are getting insane im so happy the purveyor has been nice to me
---
Thanks, PC player here though :)
---
Exactly! I used to do that to save valuable mods. Hopefully this also gets added.
---
Having to kill the prime with another 30 seconds to spare so it registers doesnt help either
---
Source = Google it, Quakecon I believe it was said.
---
I‚Äôm white and they wasn‚Äôt using it with an a at the end, they were using it with er. One wasn‚Äôt American, one was a redneck and the 3rd never said much just laughed a lot. Thank you we want to enjoy our game play time not deal with that crap. I could hear them harassing other players as well like it was an ok thing to do.
---
I don't know about a bug, but it does feel like my thirst is going up insanely fast
---
I wondered if it would drop during Meat Week. I've been watching for it but so far my luck has been crap. Building the pen is the last step for one of my Possum badges and I'm willing to shell out the caps at the vendor just to get it out of the way!
---
Yeah it would be nice and less frustration, it would also lead to less playtime and faster boringness.
---
One point in FO76 is the rng-grind. If the mods are craftable there would be way less need to hunt those plans for most of the players.
---
I've kinda been noticing that for the past couple days but to be honest i wasnt really paying attention to the diseases that i may have had
---
Wow thats so stupid
---
they are stupidly overpriced, 75+k for a weapon that kills in 1 less bullet is a joke
---
can't say much though as ive been fortunate enough to trade people items they need for their build to get items i need
---
I was very fortunate in that I didn't have any junk on me. It was adventure, so it was all in good fun. Would do again, so long as there was some warning, I suppose. If you just stumble on it, it might not be so entertaining.
---
Then I will just count my blessings. Very strange. Good luck!!
---
Yeah caps are worthless and everybody wants the same armour and weapons
---
Thirst seemed to be more pronounced when I played earlier today, yes.
---
European version \[PC\] is available at various Keystores for about 17-18 ‚Ç¨.
---
I noticed during the last Meat Week that the horde event that pops *immediately after* Leader of the Pack would not trigger.  I still hear the siren/alarm sound that plays right before Melody Larkin announces the event, but it abruptly cuts off, and no final boss event triggers.  Now it's happening again.  I thought this one was taken out *because* of Meat Week because it resumes as soon as Meat Week is over.  
---
Do leader of the Pack, then after it completes and you get your reward, you'll hear another event begin, except that it doesn't.
---
I am having some real weight issues lately, both on my person and in my stash. I need to take some time and look through everything very carefully. I am largely melee and have thousands upon thousands of rounds of ammo in all calibers. I'd like to continue to echo that I wish we could sell ammo to vendors. I've been dropping ammo around the world in various stations and selling others for 1 cap. Tough out there...
---
I think maybe since I have been displaying junk instead of scrapping it, this has contributed to my stash issues. I may have to take down a few displays.
---
Added! Cause that sounds like a Nuka-of-a-plan!
---
There are a couple random events that will trigger a passive SB fly over. Even if you try to aggro it, it will usually fly away. There's also the one that spawns at the end of Mayor for a Day that is very difficult to aggro if you're not the one doing the quest. Other than that, if they haven't seen you or you are out of range, it can take a sec to aggro them. Unless, that is, you're in a hurry or need to be sneaky to get somewhere, then they'll see you every time.
---
Added! Hopefully I‚Äôll catch you online sometime!
---
One way to improve the odds of success drastically is to build a base close to the event.  Enemies seem to be drawn to my missile turrets on top of high towers and will charge for the MG turrets I have behind concrete walls.
---
Also, people just seem to be  more likely to show up when a base is there.  Maybe it gives people a place to scrap their junk before fast traveling away, or maybe it's people wanting to shop at my vending machines, but I've never had fewer than four people, even in the middle of a weekday in NA.
---
Rarely, an enemy will still run away, but you've just got to watch the clock and chase them down if there's any danger of running out of time.
---
Can confirm: the location is the only thing that affects the Prime Meat reward.
---
Followed shortly by a ban wave to deal with the people that think cheating is a solution.
---
Those ammo prices are a little crazy, but caps are ridiculously easy to make.  You can kill a supermutant/scorched/mole miner, pick up his weapon, and sell it for 10-30 caps to a vendor.  You can pick up pretty much any item laying around in the world and sell it for at least 1 cap to a vendor.  It doesn't take long at all to hit your 1400 vendor cap limit each day if you clear out a few areas with densely packed enemies.
---
This is why most legendaries go for thousands (or more) of caps.  Caps aren't really worth anything.  Some people try to price things 'realistically' in their vendors.  They say "Well I have 20,000 caps so I wouldn't part with these stimpaks for less than 30 caps a piece because 30 caps is just one weapon drop from a supermutant."  Makes sense, but there are dozens of other players selling stimpaks for less so nobody bothers to buy from them.  
---
Also, aside from fast travel costs, and the 10% tax on vendor goods, there isn't really anything sucking caps out of the economy, so inflation is rampant.  The only reason you don't see some legendaries going for millions of caps is that nobody can hold that much.
---
However, the other interesting thing going on is that if you know what you want, its often easier to farm it yourself instead of farming caps to buy it from someone else.  Despite how easy it is to get caps, farming specific resources/items is even easier, so massive supply is really the only thing keeping the prices low for common items.  Supply/demand swings way over in the other direction when discussing rare items like well rolled legendaries.
---
TL;DR Fallout 76 economy is weird.
---
George Romero based a lot of his movies in western PA for a reason
---
Have seen Grahm selling them on occasion during meat week.
---
Yes exactly meat week blocks the Horde events from spawning. It happened last time as well. So instead of a horde event where you get a chance at a 3 star boss you gotta jump thru all of Graham‚Äôs hoops for meat and cheesy 1 star items. 1 step forward, 2 back. The Bethesda way. For proof do Leader of the pack event at Tyler County Fairgrounds. After you complete the event it should always trigger wolf horde; the Forrest. Now, nothing.. it never triggers
---
are you trying to say it isn't a bug?  because you don't know Bethesda if you don't think a bug can carry over from game to game, cos they sure do...
---
I want a Mr Pebbles bed &amp; altar in the ATOM shop

Mr fuzzy tokens are my bitcoin
---
Inside the level 3 safe, inside the mausoleum. Friggin stoked man! Didn't really want to stump up the 3K caps for it, and it's one of my favourite weapons in the game!
---
I find it a bit hit and miss. It depends on how many other players join in. With more people about (and more chance of success) it‚Äôs quite fun. But  there‚Äôs too many empty prime cuts events, which then lead to barely passing or failed cook outs.
---
Thanks! Looking forward to it.
---
hells yes
---
I don't know, maybe they just don't like you (SpongeBob reference).
---
This would be good. I have several different characters who represent different factions and I end up not wanting to even say hello on my alts because it's a nuisance to keep switching every so often.
---
Every time you play, sell out the vendors! I spent over 20k on 2 3star executioners swing speed weapons, and a couple armor pieces, and I'm still sitting on almost 14k caps. I only keep the legendary weapons/ armor in my vendor that people will actually buy, and I try* to price it a couple hundred caps less than what I think other people would charge, and if anything stays in there for too long, scrip it or sell it for a really low price! Sell mothman egg omelets, along with EVERYTHING you can pick up. Theres a lot of perks/ ways to increase your cap haul when selling to vendors also
---
Sounds like blasphemy mate, I pray only to Purveyor Murmrgh, Harbinger of Legendaries and God of DissapointmentüòÇ
---
'Bad RNG is not the case'. Guess what RNG stands for.
---
I'd loose the weight saving perks under Strength and add starched genes and class freak for later. Speed Demon and Marsupial are great for getting into/shifting position.
---
Congratulations to you both!üôÇ
---
Leaving now is a ridiculous grind though, and for the most part there's nothing remotely enjoyable. For example, the Radium rifle has 40+ mods, most of which can't be found or bought, they can only be learned.
---
The "drop rate" on learning them seems to be roughly 10%, which means you have to craft and scrap several hundred rifles to learn them all. It's just a straight up waste of time.
---
Sturdy Frame and Adamantium Skeleton don't work with power armour. I would take Batteries Included instead of Power User as it will affect fusion cores and all energy ammo, if you want to use gauss, tesla, laser or plasma weapons.
---
I can't speak for anyone else, but my drops have been significantly better during Meat Week.
---
Along with the dying and not being able to respawn as your helpless body lies there wanting to be alive again but cant because no matter how many times you hit the button to respawn it just wont open the map for you.
---
not gonna run any mutations?  if so you need starched genes and class freak, also most rifle builds utilize VATS quite a bit and your agility is pretty low.  looks like you want the carry weight, this is a jack of all build that doesn't really master anything, the best strength builds are heavy guns and melee, the best builds in general have one focus, yours has at least two
---
Halfway through the fight/scenario when the other person showed up. 
---
I don‚Äôt know exactly how this works as I‚Äôve never been here. So the other guy got to the console before me, of course, and entered in their keycard and code and launched. I came along after thinking maybe I just have to wait or it will mark the mission done for me. It didn‚Äôt work that way obviously and I put my keycard in as part of that process and it took it.
---
The acid vfx causes lag. Make sure you have enough hp to survive when it does when you have 4 crickets on you
---
See here: https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/db4jdh/_/f21tft5/?context=1
---
Same over here on ps4
---
I‚Äôm a hoarder so it wouldn‚Äôt bother me losing junk, unless it was stable flux and I always stash it straight away. I‚Äôve not had trap camp just camp high up and then they log out, now that annoys me.
---
You can use sentinel powered with berserker and have the same damage reduction while maintaining full hp.
---
No matter how you slice it 19% hp is a serious sacrifice.
---
If you're talking about condition, a couple points: the condition bar is the average of all the items in that stack. It's possible to have a nearly full bar and still have things in the stack spoil because they were very low condition but fewer in quantity, so the average was really high. Also, if you take off your good with salt perk card or your refrigerated back pack, even for a second, your food will take a sudden drop in condition. Remember that getting into PA takes your backpack off. Also, sometimes the condition doesn't always update right away. So you might eat food out of a stack and the average doesn't correct until a few minutes later. This can cause some confusion as to the true condition of your food.
---
Regarding hunger and thirst, the rate is fixed and has been the same since day one. However, if you are doing a lot in game, like with all the meat week stuff going on, you are actually doing a lot more than you think and your meters just appear to be going down faster. Time is just passing faster for you. Coupled with the fact that the meat sweats keep your hunger meter from going down while your thirst continues on helps enhance this effect. I have a pretty predictable play time and pattern and I'm drinking the same amount every day as I have done for months. Also, watch your status for effects that might be causing extra thirst like chems or diseases.
---
Where are you finding passive Scorchbeasts?
---
Thank you. I went to an event after and asked if anyone was willing to help me so I don‚Äôt have to spend 2.5 hours doing it all again and had two high-level people offer to help me tonight. So gonna work with them. They also gave me a ton of tips/info about playing that I never picked up on or knew, so that was nice. Will help gameplay. This game has a lot to do and doesn‚Äôt do the best job of saying all you can do after finishing the main quests. Such as the whole turn in legendary items and use those things to buy other legendary items. It ran me through it once, but when you‚Äôre so low level, you forget about it.
---
More things in case someone else that isn‚Äôt deep into this game gets lost on them: Didn‚Äôt know the value of running events until they explained it drops legendary items and then you can turn those in. Value of having different power armor wasn‚Äôt readily understandable to me. Didn‚Äôt even know about mutations and they explained those to me. Value of having perks set up is way different than previous fallout‚Äôs.
---
There‚Äôs tons of videos on really cool ‚Äúpre built‚Äù locations. Areas where you can place your camp that have a point of interest, underground hideout, buildable in houses, etc.
---
So, since the Primal Cut and Meat Week events have the potential to drop Legendary items, you believe the drop rates have been lowered (by maybe the same amount) at the other normal game locations? In the name of "balance" per BGS info.
---
This kind of, sort of, maybe makes sense in that all things shouldn't necessarily be additive in terms of new drops. It would be nice however to have this be formally made known if it is indeed the case.
---
May also be their way of subtly forcing folks into the special events if they know the regular in-game drop rates will be reduced.
---
I don't play NW but questions 1, 2, and 5 are all answered on [Behtesda.net](https://Behtesda.net), check their weekly Inside The Vault newsletter for all official info about the game
---
This is ENTIRELY bad rng. This shows up every time theres literally any change and happens the most right before and right after a patch day. This is literally just due to the servers being up for a long long time
---
Yes please. I think everyone would like to see the map location (map view) and a screenshot.
---
They were talking about when adding in new weapons,etc. They also talked about how bug fixes need can have unintended consequences so everything needs to be rebalanced and adjusted when things are changed. This what not about when they add a seasonal event. 
---
Btw if someone asks to cite your source and you say ‚Äúgoogle it‚Äù, you sound like an idiot. Full offense.
---
Every RPG out there should allow you to add map pints with a title and comments by default. My game will and possibly more.
---
I actually had a guy follow me around and when I wouldn‚Äôt fight him, he threatened to crash my WiFi ‚Äî then actually did it. Only later did I realize that‚Äôs his bag as dude‚Äôs handle is something like Urwifigonelol . Lame.
---
Regarding the 3 points you're proposing to put in Gladiator: I'd recommend instead putting 1 star in Gladiator, 1 in Expert Gladiator and 1 in Master Gladiator. This will give you 30% damage instead of the 20% you get from putting those 3 points into 1 card. It will also give you flexibility. (I would however think about foregoing one-handed altogether and consider unarmed as an alternative. Unlike the other melee classes, there is only 1 perk card needed to max out damage on unarmed (Iron Fist) as it's incredibly strong.) Good luck honing your build. I am currently playing a less than perfect rifle build but my original, high level character is unarmed.
---
You cant even have modded files on the ps4....
---
can you?
---
Hi Karen...
---
it wouldn't surprise me if they adjusted the spoil rates to sell more fridges...
---
What a fun, inventive idea! I love it! Congrats!
---
Collision Course almost always spawns a neutral Scorchbeast.
---
This isn‚Äôt actually happening though. OP is wrong.
---
Ahh no idea then
---
I'm saying you if they haven't changed it in a decade don't hold your breath. Stuff that should have been fixed by the end of beta are still present.
---
There has been no change in legendary droprates since meat week was activated.
---
I've found a pretty good recipe for big targets. I'm normally stealth but for Primal Cuts that won't work most of the time. Because of this I invested into moving to an unarmed Junkie's build. But, for big targets that can stagger you, I hang back and use a Junkie's heavy weapon. Currently I'm using a 1* Junkie's LMG. With 9 points into Heavy Gunner, Glow Sight 3 (for the Glowing Mirelurk Queen), I make very quick work of the Legendary Alpha Glowing Mirelurk Queen, and other big targets. That's a damage boost of 50% + 60% for most enemies and +60% for glowing ones.
---
For the queen, though, I use shotgun+enforcer to cripple it's legs and spouts first. It becomes defenseless, although the legendary version gets back up so watch out for that.
---
Not at level 54 when you don‚Äôt fully understand how important perk specs are and don‚Äôt have the greatest weapons. I have nothing above a 1-star legendary.
---
Yes it does. I know that. I am wondering what OP is talking about. Whether it‚Äôs that event or something else.
---
sure, I have little expectations when it comes to this game, but that's not what we were discussing...
---
Good to know, thanks for the quick response
---
Just a friendly reminder that you didn't answer OP's question.
---
It can be ridiculous, yes. It needs to be balanced.
---
But I don't think selling mods would be the way to go, especially in a grinding game like FO76.
---
If you untrack the quest from your Pip-Boy, it should just disappear.
---
Did you say twin sister??!?
---
I looked through my Misc items and the keycard was gone. I had to go find a drone and do it all over again. After the guy launched his nuke, I put it into the machine and it took it and then wouldn‚Äôt give it back.
---
I‚Äôm sure the silo resetting means that‚Äôs gone, no? Its not gonna remember at that point of the scenario that I put the keycard in especially if I logged out?
---
This map is only a month or so old. The first map was flatwoods. It is beta so they are testing one at a time for now. 
---
I am not sharing my top secret spawn place that always gives  2 magazines, a bobble head, and a sweet starting weapon.
---
Everyone seems to drop in the center of Morgan town and the university
---
I‚Äôm not saying it isn‚Äôt a sacrifice, I die a lot on my bloodied character. But everyone on here is so so desperate to tell everyone alllllll the negatives about bloodied, because we all know it‚Äôs op.
---
I would say bloodied and berserkers are equally as sacrificial, without mentioning nerd rage or adrenal reaction which help bloodied even more, so berserkers really should have the same boost
---
I've run into them before, they're great dudes. Dropped a bunch of ammo to let me help them take down the queens
---
I like the suggestion above about the first person to scan their card and enter the silo being locked to launch.
---
If anyone comes in after they, they can help, but can‚Äôt do the actual launch.
---
Make it so if you leave the silo, it resets. Maybe without taking away the keycard, but it resets everything regardless. No longer allow the pre-staging thing others talked about here. If it‚Äôs so easy to run through at the much higher levels, pre-staging isn‚Äôt that important.
---
What
---
It‚Äôs also easier solo than with a group, depending on the lvl of everyone there
---
This is the main reason I turn off world voice and use team only.  The amount of trash and total moronic yammering is too much anymore.
---
I mean I said some immature shit when I was younger but damn....
---
Does that still work? I thought they patched it
---
There is a 1 in 400 chance of it dropping after the completion of Uranium Fever or perhaps Path to Enlienment
---
I can put in the code before the keycard? I kept trying to mess with the keypad and it wasn‚Äôt responsive. Maybe I wasn‚Äôt doing it right.
---
Man, you're right... i had to go back and check. Nuka World was out as last DLC 10 months after FO4 dropped.
---
We're at 10 months on 76 and have $7 refrigerators.
---
I'll run my bloodied around in the Hazmat suit. Always fun sneaking up under the SBQ's belly with basically no armor and seeing what will happen. Well, what happens is I die a lot, but still fun.
---
That was really nice of you to say, I appreciate it a lot, thank you. They're not especially recent, been tweaking a lot haha I'll take some pics this evening, upload them and make sure to reply to this comment. Apparently I could do a lot more without so many foundations but I like the clean look. Been thinking about moving though, maybe I'll work on it then!
---
The collectron is freeing for junk extractor centered bases. 500 atoms are not too difficult to earn. Highly recommend. My base used to be at the junk pile in Forest near mothman statue area under power tower. Doesn't yield as much but I was not good at emptying the extractor regularly anyways.
---
Are you just wanting to increase your damage?  If so you don't need to run a full bloodied build to do that.  Make sure you have all three ranks of rifleman maxed out along with tank killer.  Also invest in the sneak perks and escape artist.  If you are in sneak that will automatically give you 2x damage bonus.  With covert op maxed it increases your sneak to 2.5x.  Add in a couple of ranks of adrenaline for the mobs, and tenderizer in charisma and max bloodied mess in luck.  With a built up lever action and in sneak you should be able to drop most things in 3 shots or less.  
---
If you add the speed demon mutation you should be able to sneak at a faster speed if sneaking is too slow of a play style for you.  Also the adrenal reaction mutation increases your damage output as you health decreases.  You don't need to be down at 20% health to use it so I highly recommend it.
---
 Alternatively, if you don't like to sneak, switch over to commando for increased dpm.  You'll use more ammo but should drop things quicker than with a lever.  You will still need to max out the commando perks and tank killer.
---
All of this said, I enjoy running a bloodied build and have a lot of fun with it.  If I want to make it harder I change out my perk cards, armor, weapons, or just run more aggressively.  There's a lot of ways to play the game it's just figuring out how to balance all aspects of your build with your play style.
---
If you move camp will it allow you to place it again, all put together?  Or do you have to do all the rug tricks over again?  (that is to say, does it keep saying you are floating or red zoning you)

I managed to find an Instigating Gauss Rifle from another player vendor. Cost me about 2500 caps
---
The Witch Faschnat is rare? Dang I got like 12 of those when that event was on. Guess I should start selling
---
Eather way yall have modding concole players dont have that luctury + if its not true why is there vids showing bethesdas creators made mods and released them to pc players
---
Is that what that robot is?  There was one in my camp yesterday just standing there. It wasn‚Äôt mine because I couldn‚Äôt control it. It was just next to my extractor
---
Add me I‚Äôll run with ya( CptLon3starr )
---
Got mine first try during the first MeatCook
---
I really really like this, I love PA but is worthless in most situations compared to any legendary armor.
---
It‚Äôs not. OP had a typo or meant old man winter or the other ultra rares.
---
Thanks man that was great advice.
---
Added! Catch you online sometime soon! I might not be a team anchor by the time we join up!
---
Nice, wish it counted as its own storage, that's alot of weight in your stash.
---
I'd still like to have the marker on the map
---
Added on Discord and IG, and playing a lot is good! Increases the chances you‚Äôll be on when I am
---
All over.  There were three scorchbeasts flying around the cranberry bog last night near where the meat week event is and only one was hostile.  I see it more often in the bog and mire but there are a lot more scorchbeasts in those locations overall so the stats might be skewed.
---
Yeah I wasn‚Äôt a saint when I was younger but these kids took it to far. Karmas a bitch they say.
---
Neat idea, but I just want to be able to hack robots and have them at my camp like you can take animals.
---
The one time I've tried moving it, I had to do it all over again. Not sure if that's the case every time or if that one was a fluke. But I haven't wanted to risk it again.
---
Thank you! Once I get myself a good heavy gun or shotgun and a melee weapon I should be able to get myself out of my fragile levels :P 
---
So much has changed in this game since I left, Vending machines are interesting,
---
Anyways, added in Discord and in game
---
Is it so hard to make it to the Morgantown airport now?
---
Its part of the, what i call the ‚Äúgoldie locks gang‚Äù random spawn of three bears. 2 50s and an 80. Sometimes it glows and drops Legendarys. Mostly at the scenic overlooks
---
They stated that 2 caps per 5.56 round was too expensive and that they sell there's for under 1 cap per round. So I would like to purchase 20,000 rounds of 5.56 for under a cap a round from them then I will put them in my vending machine and make a nice profit at 2 caps per round.
---
My other ones that don't have the workbenches seem to place fine btw.
---
You can't then, I usually just have a few up at a time so it's not too crowded
---
If Fallout 76 was real life, we could loot his body on the way to Morgantown. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yeah no worries.  It's really just about finding out what works with your playstyle to make it fun.  Rifles with the instastgating prefix are amazing if you can find one at a decent price and are good for high health builds.
---
If the really did balance all the builds it would ruin the whole purpose of having different builds, someone with nothing but quality of life cards should not be able to compete against someone with a pure pvp build
---
That would be awesome!
---
&gt;So with that now what happens to them.
---
In game? Likely nothing worse than a gentle slap on the wrist. Otherwise, though, I like to think they go on to live miserable, joyless lives filled with nothing but drudgery, boredom, and a gnawing feeling of never being quite good enough which can only momentarily be soothed by hurling vitriol at others. 
---
Happy, content, well-adjusted and emotionally fulfilled people do not go around spewing hatespeech at strangers.
---
I agree
---
I kinda doubt that they'd lose interest in releasing atom shop cosmetic items, the vast VAST majority of players won't be on private servers anyway...there will still be money to  be made and they've already set the atom shop up as nearly exclusively cosmetic additions. Whether weapon skins are the right item to be a good return on investment for Bethesda is more up in the air, couldn't speculate without sales data haha.
---
Man if FO was real I'd be fine, since I'm not restricted stash space in real life like I am on the game
---
A buff is needed, no question.
---
But armor legendary effects should also be tweaked... Maybe if weightless armor also doesn't count against Berserker's (like Chameleon) it would make two legendary effects synergize and desirable/viable (like bloodied + unyielding).
---
Wholesome post
---
Do it at someone in Liberty Prime armor!
---
Well I hope ur right and thanks for the comment
---
Next time you go into Bravo and say insert a card it will give you a raspberry sound and text in the upper left will say that you have already put a card in at this point you can enter the launch code.  Again if you want a few cards I have over a hundred across my mules.
---
What part is hard?
---
Exactly! Sad little life‚Äôs. They‚Äôll meet their match soon enough. Bethesda website said they would investigate but yeah probably nothing. It said to block the names and report them. They will now not be allowed in the same server as me so there‚Äôs at least that.
---
Who knows why anyone does anything in this game really, I was shopping at someone‚Äôs base and they had a sign that said they were buying scrip legendary and listed how much per star. I messaged them are u still buying and their response was ‚Äúdepends, how much and how many‚Äù. I‚Äôm like uh  I have 15 1 stars and the price you have labeled, it‚Äôs the reason why I‚Äôm asking?? They then left the server without saying anything else. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Hmmmm, I like it. I mostly made this lore after a discord server did a question of the day asking about where you set the next fallout game.
---
No, the key card unlocks the keypad.  The process is key card, launch code, targeting computer.
---
A chance for good PR without having to patch anything? Of *course* they were happy to help!
---
Hey congratulations on the whole wedding thing, and finding someone as nerdy as you are. That‚Äôs pretty cool in any game.
---
I don‚Äôt know... they seem to sniff me out anywhere I go. Only ones that don‚Äôt are the one at collision course and that one at mayor for a day if someone else is doing the quest, but he will also go after me sometimes.
---
Congratulations you two, maybe I'll see y'all in the wastes. The perk cards were a pretty cool touch.I couldn't help but laugh at her when she said, " how tall does he think I am "
---
Doesn‚Äôt this drop from some events early on?
---
PA bug + no free content for end game killed this game. Mark my words. This game goes dead ffrom noww on. I actualy tried to play today but when i max out scrip theres nothing.for me to do. Meat week is just waste of ammo for me.
---
If your on ps4 I have an extra 1* anti armor plasma thrower you can have. Just make sure you favorite it otherwise you might accidentally scrap it.
---
 I bought one from Graham yesterday, but why in the hell is it labled as "Brahmin Pen Plan" but it's actually just a "fertilizer producer", not a pen at all!!!!!!!!
---
I live on ionized meat and inert flux so my meters are pretty constant but my teammate has noticed increased thirst and as I gather lot flux to craft it has seemed to go off quicker last few days similar to what happened when the brewing quest was introduced...?
---
Wow really? Is there a timeout on that? Even logging out or anything?
---
The comment was more along the lines of "we think we have addressed this issue for the majority of cases and will continue to look into it going forward." Which given the track record wasn't all to reassuring. Inventory loss with no recent character backup is a serious enough issue  that people arent going to tempt fate even if the chance was like 1 in 1000.
---
lol what a joke. People have been mentioning that meat week has disabled horde events since it started. You're claiming you've only been made aware now? I just assumed they were taken away as another way to nerf legendary drops like every other update to this game.
---
Yep, Deana &amp; Sally are twins!
---
Junkies build sounds like a lot of fun. And Glow Sight 3 sounds like a good situational card for me to consider investing in at a higher level. I have Exterminator's and Hunter's handmades which are proving quite useful for Primal Cuts, but no way are they up to the job of soloing anything like a Mirelurk Queen without a serious lead investment that I am just not prepared to make! My main is an unarmed melee who never has to worry about ammo upkeep or constantly breaking weapons. I fly through lead and my guns feel like they break a million times quicker than my gauntlets, so I'm finding this aspect of my rifle build pretty tedious.
---
I‚Äôm confused by the above then. Is what you‚Äôre saying that every week, you only have to type the code in once and then all times going back there, you don‚Äôt have to enter a code again?
---
Dude this is wholesome congrats dude!
---
can't be bloodied and tank, tank builds are literally about high HP
---
Hey man so how about those farming methods? You'd like to share?
---
\*insert dave chappelle crackhead legendary meme here\*
---
I have hardly played during this meat week after having non-stop meat sweats the first time around so I can't even venture a guess on this theory.
---
But I think I would like a little more information how to replicate this part "I pull 10 to 15 God rolls on average with my farming methods every single day"
---
Yes you can smelt it.  Also the junk yard has a spot you can mine, though it‚Äôs a popular spot.
---
Take your time with the gameplay. Have fun.
---
Mr Prize Bot: CONGRATULATIONS!!
---
yeah i was planning on going the purveyor during the sale in the 17th. I‚Äôve been grinding for caps for a few days. Thanks for the suggestions.
---
Yeah that sounds cool too! I can just think of the role play aspect of it like, this is my daughter or husband or something yk
---
It's a bit more then that. You have to attach roofs then a wall on the other end an remove the first roof then first wall then stair. Then replace roof an first wall. Then remove the roofs and second wall.
---
Uh I got three 3*s at AWOL Armaments and they all three dropped three star items. The only difference I have noticed is the fact that there's no Horde events. Have you thought about triggering an event that gives at least one guaranteed 3* like Encryptid?
---
Find someone from Sioux Falls and someone from up near Buffalo and we'll have the whole state covered!
---
Explorer every location. Lots of interesting buildings and locales to see.
---
You would also need acid to break down the ores.
---
Thank you for the offer but I roll big gun so it doesn‚Äôt help me. Thank you again though. Nice to see descent ppl coming together.
---
I envy you having the entire map to explore. Have fun!
---
If you do not have a card on your person you will not make it through the laser grid.  But many people fail the reactor room and give up at that point. So people would be upset on losing a card if they have to put it in at the start of the silo only to fail the silo.  Since putting in the card is part of the final steps and after all of the danger is gone the chance of losing a card is minimized.  But as easy are cards are to get, using them as a silo "cost" and locking the silo at the start would prevent people from stealing silos but who would have to put in the card? all persons entering the silo or only the person launching?   There would have to be a timer on silo exclusivity but what is a good time.  I have seen people take hours in the silo for me it is about 15 minutes, so what is the magical amount of time?
---
How about perks, is there anything changeable or like other games. And what should i go for?
---
I would imagine it comes out sometime during the election
---
I've had people complain about my legendary prices before (4000 at highest), but people buy them. Bullets are 1, full charge cores 50 (fusion or plasma), ultracite cores 75. Unique outfits are like 100, plans are half price at most, food recipes are 5.
---
People still complain and occasionally break my camp because they are mad. No win situation I guess
---
Take your take exploring, don‚Äôt rush the main story. If you come across enemies to high to take on, it means you need to level up. Listen/read holotapes and notes. 
---
Also- the game starts off slow. Basically flatwoods acts as a tutorial. It definitely picks up after that. Explore western side of map and forest first.
---
It does this right below Camden Park too
---
Now you can sell them for 20,000 caps to someone who needs to eat them for an achievement
---
Now do the correct thing,and place the 7 seven special on one shelf,guns on the top and the rest in the middle.  That is a good display.
---
No idea what that is but get some acid and smelt that stuff
---
You won't get a reply. Maybe you will but it will be the same farming methods everyone else has just better RNG. Or if there is it's gonna boil down to "I play ten hours straight a day no breaks" not saying that is bad or wrong, but the amount of time is gonna be a factor to what difference people can make
---
The codes reset on Tuesday.  So if you enter the code on Tuesday you do not have to reenter the code for that silo until the codes expire the following Tuesday.
---
Play 10 to 15 hours a day
---
Can confirm this. I do LotP every time I see it active and have not received the Wolf Horde that should be Part 2 since Meat Week started.
---
That‚Äôs really about personal preference. I say invest in rifleman perks early on if you can. Ammo is common and hunting rifles are effective early on. Also pay attention to weapon levels. 
---
Perks are a lot more fluid with the card system. You to add a new card every level up to level 50. After thy you can tweak and adjust but can‚Äôt have any more total perk points allocated.
---
Oh. Nevermind then. I'll stick to my current plan that yields 0 god rolls each and every day then. Lol.
---
Yep, me too.
---
today is the last day of survival, just find an out of the way spot and drop everything, then switch characters and rejoin
---
I was talking about the very end, not at the start. The majority of the silo would be the same, but while the nuke keycard primes the nuke, it also allows you to enter another room. The targeting controls and code input keypad are in this new small room, behind a new laser grid that can only be accessed by the one who just used the card. Everyone else who ran the silo can still get the rewards for doing a silo run, but this would mean only the one who used the card would be able to actually do the launch to prevent another situation like the OP described.

Plan a build in advance using the above tools to theorycraft.  A lot of people who try just "winging it" wind up asking for help as their characters cannot hang later in the game.
---
Pray to RNGesus for non-stop god rolls and rare drops üôèüèª
---
I'd say maybe have just one tracked at a time to minimise clutter.
---
Typo, meant to say with
---
with a good enough sneak any weapon can be good lol.
---
I guess we just have to wait patiently. The Mr. Pebbles bed could be a lot of fun! I'm thinking red headboard with a picture of his wonderful space kitty head on the bedspread. Thoughts? Haha!
---
no, melee and heavy guns are pretty much the best builds right now, sniper builds are better than they were but still not that great
---
Just happened to me twice, for the first time ü§Æ
---
My post was not clickbait you masturbators
---
Whos he/she
---
I hate to admit it, but she is probably the most like one of our more... traditional gods. She either likes you or she doesn't. She seems to mostly hate us all...
---
ive had it happen more and more for months now
---
Congrats!! One of my side characters has a comic book shop, and I'm sooooo behind on bobbleheads/magazines
---
It should be more than enough ...depending on how much sets your building. The material used the most imo are springs.
---
Yes, prob 100 or so of each should be enough. That hoarding will prevent you from accruing loot, so manage that inventory.
---
I can see how THAT would be annoying. That's either a crash (and they're just as irritated as you are) or carelessness. If you vend, check the map before closing the game, dammit!
---
Duh...I dunno...Random Nacho Grabber?
---
On a real note, have you ever thought they could alter the possibilities of those Random Numbers and make shittier ones more frequent? Yes, yes they can and did...it's not random if someone is making the possibilities more difficult to attain.
---
You need to make sure light levels are adequate (or get tinted glasses). Make sure you are Well Fed, Well Hydrated and Well Rested. Drink water throughout your gaming sessions. Get up and stretch frequently.
---
Yep definitely take your time.  You will find plans along the way.  Make sure you open up your menu to read the plans....lol most of us learned that one the hard way...  Make sure to scrap all the junk you pick up or you will max out what you can store.  I also recommend following the main questline through Flatwoods and Morgantown.  It's basically the tutorial and gives you some good plans to start out.  Other than that have fun and enjoy the game.  There are a lot of people out there that are willing to help out.
---
PS also check the suitcases at the train stations...some of us higher levels will sometimes drop off extra supplies in them for people that need them.
---
Twice since the SB hunt challenge started I picked fights with neutral SBs in the Bog area that obviously fought back, but the health bar remained white and I couldn't target it in VATS.
---
Well, why not? It's their problem if no one buys the stuff. I always think: "What would I pay for the stuff I sell?"
---
My prices:
---
* Water= free in unlocked water purifiers
---
* Ammo = 1 cap (would put 0,1c for most if possible)
---
* Materials = 1-5 caps
---
* Bobbleheads/Magazines/Fusion Cores/Outfits = 25-50c
---
* Plans = 50-150 caps, food recipes banned.
---
* Flux = 100 caps
---
* Legendary weapons = min. 250c per star, good ones for more, max 5k
---
* Legendary armor = min. 150c per star, good ones for more, max. 750c
---
Shop runs very good, "ka-ching" every 2-10 minutes. Materials and ammo generate tons of caps, have to permanently restock them. Players also seem to like my shitty 3 star "scrip"-weapons for 750c. ;)
---
Sometimes I put a very good weapon in the vending machine for a small amount of caps and wait for the reaction. Recently I sold a lv.45 TSE Minigun with 250 damage resistance while reloading for 1,5k - dude turned his mic on and freaked out. Well, my stash is full, I had no choice? ;D
---
1 set.
---
Here ya go. Been rocking an explosive/heavy build for a while now.

not as OP as it once was but it is still manageable
---
-eta- Id use a combat shotgun before a pumper
---
Either you keep that all in your box and it isn‚Äôt affected by your junk weight reducing card, or you‚Äôre carrying it on you, either way you need to re-evaluate what‚Äôs truly valuable to you.
---
I think the game is more fulfilling if you spend time reading up and character planning in advance, so you know what you're walking into and what build you're aiming for as you level up. Watch a few top tips YouTube videos for people new to the game. Defo read up on stash/inventory management so you know what junk you should and shouldn't hold on to. Hang around in this Reddit for a few hours to get the measure of what's currently going on in game. Don't let the volume of complaint posts give you a false impression of the game. Those complaining or venting are often not wrong, as there are a lot of bugs and broken bits, but overall this is a great, sprawling game that it's so good to get lost in. And there are a lot of warm, friendly people playing it. Oh, and make a start on the Tadpoles quest as soon as you can, which rewards a backpack that gives extra carry weight (but takes some grinding to get). Start this quest/challenge by reading a poster on the notice board in any of the train stations. Have fun!
---
Still bugged.
---
Oh god. The whole TOWN is moving? Are you rebuilding a town, or going for something new and different?
---
I kid you not. When I see your links, I click them. Every time. Your builds blow my mind. Nothing LOOKS like you had to compromise to fit in the build limit. Everything is decorated and looks reasonable. I think I've asked this before, but what system are you on? I want to visit these builds!!
---
Oh dang, I didn't realize that. I'm sure you come across that upon your 2nd time entering in the same week to learn that. That definitely puts it at even more of a disadvantage to those of us never being in there. What's funny is I think I did see him go from card port directly to targeting. So I was screwed even if I got the card in before him.
---
Should be good.
---
And make them unkillable!!! (And maybe make them have not that much damage, and when they go down like dogmeat they stay in stimpak me mode until the fight is over or you stimpak them.)
---
I don‚Äôt understand the question. You can see when you get the plans how much material is needed for each piece.
---
I never jest - and don't call me Shirley!
---
I have gone days later, I have not tried weeks so cannot confirm how long.  My team launches many nukes per evening.  And we get caught in the personal cool down timer issue (below).  So sometimes if we lose track of which silos a person has launched from we have to call another person to actually launch.
---
What happens is we have 3 people that run the silos on our team.  We each do a silo on a server so the server is expended.  So if I launched from Charlie I a personal timer for charlie of 3 hours.  On the new server I launch from Alpha now I have personal cool down timers on both charlie and alpha. etc.  It will let me run the silo, do launch prep, put in a card, and will not let me access the targeting computer and tells me that I am on cool down (paraphrased not the actual message). So I leave the silo.  The next time I run the silo it goes through the sound and message and I just go to the targeting computer.  You will have to enter a valid key code before you can access the targeting computer since you only put in the card.
---
I already bought the game, just wanted tips, thanks btw. Any channels do you recommend?
---
I wasted 3k for absolutely garbage, garbage that were so garbage that I didn‚Äôt know existed. I usually measure my luck with explosive and bloodied drops. At the purveyor I usually get one explosive effect out of 8-9 tries. It could be stalkers or mutants, doesn‚Äôt matter, the rate has been steady. Since a few weeks ago it stopped completely. Nothing but limb damage, bashing, and vats hit chance. This is on four characters and many servers, not just RNG any more.
---
Never click when using PC fallout 76. Always confirm with E, Space or Enter.
---
Every PC-only problem with this game involves clicking with the mouse. They obviously test PC using an Xbox controller.
---
I've noticed several enemies falling from the sky as I run into a town. They usually fall to their death. Which is kind of annoying since I wanted to kill them for experience.
---
No i mean is it worth it? Is it a bad idea?
---
Thx m8 üòÅ üëç
---
Yep, If he had used that silo before he only needed to put in a card and launch.
---
Not my build necessarily but this site will help you plan ahead

---
I'd be screwed. I don't ACTUALLY know how to make bullets out of old paint cans, and guns out of Hot Wheels...
---
I'm on XBox, but thank you for the offer. I know there's at least one person on my team who runs medic. Not sure if they also have quack surgeon or not. They've been very handy to have around, disproving the people who claim medic builds are stupid and pointless.
---
Kinda makes sense except it would have to reject the card if that person is on cool down.
---
This is not fucking clickbait
---
Fuck. I can pack bullets but also dont know how to use baby rattles and toy rocket ships...
---
Sounding like one isn't that bad, thanks! Being one like yourself...well...is....
---
FULL OFFENSE!
---
EDIT: The only people who have to state and make clear they are being offensive are Idiots.
---
Edit 2: Hey tough üëß Miller, how many hours in 76, honeybun? 500 maybe 600....lol, I got 1800+ hrs in....nobody should be listening to you at all, what would you really know or notice? Lol...sad, you're on Reddit more than 76, post history....what do you do for a living...? Nothing...lol, you sit on Reddit all day everyday.
---
Hi! Please make sure QA is not testing PC builds exclusively with the Xbox controller. Mouse needs love!
---
Thank you!
---
I don't see any evidence of lower quality.  It's always dumb luck and good drops have always been rare.
---
The excavator power armor? Well, Hoarder Evan, I have good news for you! When you WEAR that power armor, you will get more when you mine ore. So you will be able to USE the power armor to accumulate MORE junk!
---
(Absolutely worth it. You can always find more junk.)
---
Happy scrapping!
---
PS4, swing by if you can! I'm gonna rebuild the whole town don't worry, just want someplace a little quieter. I'm right next to a building with lots of annoying enemy spawns, I don't mind the fast travel enemies but would like to avoid world spawn enemies
---
No. 500 caps a couple of hours is not great. Most people dont bother with cheap stuff in their store because they paying stash weight until it sells. Therefore most big multiple hundred level players dont bother unless its a multiple thousand dolar item. Like I regularly make 15,000 caps in a few hours maybe more. Now my ammo is super cheap but my legendary shop is priced just a hair above like marketplace. So i seing wildy to and from max caps always.
---
Yuuup. Even my dedicated friends who I played Fallout with everyday for months have dropped off the face of the Appalachian Earth. 
---
And now servers I go into have only 10 people in them. It's kind of depressing.
---
The timeout is "Until the next nuclear code reset". The codes reset every Monday Evening I believe? But your nuke card use is never "stolen" when someone else launches before you. Your usage of the card is "banked" until the next time the weekly nuke codes reset, so if you go back into the same silo right now, albeit on another server, it will remember the card you slotted and the code you typed in... until the codes next reset.
---
  
---
So your only real loss in this was the time spent clearing the silo up to that point, which multiple people have offered to help you with.
---
I have many, (all max lvl) AA prime gatling plasma, IE minigun, Ghoul slayer's explosive 50 CAL, explosive Zealot's lmg with prime, bloodied minigun and gatling laser, and a instagaiting fat man
---
Edit: also have a lvl 35 bloodied fat man wich is very good
---
I think the cutoff is like 18 or 20 characters.  "Money Gun" and "Strip Club Gun?" are too short for a post title.  Just add a few more words.
---
I wish I was. I just made the suggestion of a strip club money gun that shoots prewar dollars and the thing gets shutdown after like 10 seconds
---
I think the timeout is the weekly code reset, due to how the nuke card use controls the ability to enter a valid authorization code.
---
Make a second character. I have one bloodied, and one full health. It's nice to have options, and it didn't take that long to get both to 50.
---
You missed earlier. Did just that and laid out a fair and just idea for silos. And was met with content and mockery.
---
THANK YOU! I just didn't want to make it too long
---
I have a shotgunner. I started with a pump action, which was tolerable. The double barrel did more damage than the combat shotgun I have now, but I wasted a LOT of time reloading. My combat rifle is explosive and does well against most enemies.
---
BUT, there is a catch. The range is pretty crap, and it does eff all against a mirelurk queen. As in, it was embarassingly bad. Now, you could get one of the appropriate legendaries (+dmg against mirelurks). That would help. But it's not ideal for scorchbeasts, either. So make sure you have something you can supplement your shotgun with.
---
So once OuterWorlds comes out then I'll stop playing 76 until Wastelanders.
---
Strip club money gun?!
---
Lvl50? Are you selling? :D
---
Again, I respectfully disagree in that it allows people to purposefully "take up"/camp silos, and could lead to the unpopular situation of people having to server-surf to find free silos to launch from.
---
No, I have crossed the code reset with a card in  the silo.
---
I don't think so. As I understand it, it's just a PC thing.
---
Statistics for my drops have not changed for the worse during meat week, quite the opposite. But hey, blame your bad luck with the rng on the devs if it makes you feel better.
---
You really can solo the reactor room in standard with at best 1 code in agricolture?
---
I run a Heavy Gun/Support build, and I don't make serums but will happily spot you for a couple of starter serums if I have any spares in stock, or if you find some with a player vendor. You should take some time and vendor-surf some servers you'll be surprised at what's for sale and how cheap. i can probably get 3-6 serums at player vendors for about the price of 1 serum "retail" at the Enclave shop.
---
Just drop in a few times. You‚Äôll see a few spots that people never go to.
---
It's funny. I hear people go on and on about how toxic the PS4 players are. And then I have lovely people like you tell me that I am missing out on a good time, and that I should do it. So I think I'm just going to have to watch for those sales! (And cross my fingers that you're right about a sale when Wastelanders is out.)
---
marsupial will knock only your int down by four..
---
I made my excavator PA at whitesprings then whent bk to garahan to regester it. And yes it worked tho i was not pleased after registoring it i then had to take a photo. And at this time a glowing windigo tried to eat me &amp; it failed thankes to my power hammer
---
Oh man I miss the junk jet, launching teddy bears at ppls heads put a smile on my face. Flaming pre war money lol
---
So it‚Äôs not the marsupial? The negative effect is beyond that?
---
Damn I bought one for 25 caps. It now proudly sits in my display case next to my frog, bird decoration, and explosive bobblehead.
---
as someone who took a hiatus myself I would suggest doing things you hadn't done before, like I had only launched one nuke and didn't really get to the end game stuff before I took a break, doing the nuke zone loop has been rewarding.  finishing quests in your log is a good way to stay busy as well.
---
whether or not you have finished everything I would suggest starting a new character, with Wastelanders we are going to see a new main quest, half of which will be locked off for any player with only one character, make another character, get them to at least 50 and finish the main quest so you are prepared for Wastelanders.
---
edit: for those asking other than new quests and items to be crafted the gameplay hasn't changed noticably, bugs got fixed and tweaks were made but nothing that is going to make you say wtf during your playthrough
---
I like how this started as a he-said-she-said argument but morphed into a debate about Silo usage, and is currently a hotbed of mutual player aid.   
---
Thanks, community, for helping us turn a negative into a positive.  
---
To summarize my point of view: I'm gonna do what I want to do in-game, it's what I paid for. But if you want some help, JUST ASK, a lot of folks are willing to help.
---
break a leg
---
"Strip Club Gun" is not a descriptive title. I have no idea what I'm clicking with a title like that.
---
Yeh that‚Äôs correct every special is down by around 2 and int by -4. It‚Äôs really odd I‚Äôm out of ideas
---
Sounds like you have Herd Mentality, which gives you -2 to all stats while out of a team.
---
GL
---
Level 303, speak english only, will be online in about 4 hours.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt that show up in effects? You could‚Äôve right tho.
---
Were you the shit stain who reported me?
---
wait the sale will be soon
---
I've not yet seen any skins on sale for any weapons I actually use.
---
I'm at lvl139 and so far in game I've never even _seen_ a "Handmade" or anything else chambered for 5.56, but I scrounge all the ammo I can, because it's the hottest seller at my camp.
---
Where's my 10mm skin?
---
It could be glitched. Clear out all your mutations and see if that fixes it.
---
Man how is everyone getting so many people buying stuff? I sell for dirt cheap, and very rarely do I get sales. :(
---
Ok ta. Have to farm marsupial again tho sad face
---
I accidentally added it too my wheel and it‚Äôs invincible so yea
---
Buy 2-3 and if you get crap rolls server hop!
---
So it's the same as 4
---
If you think a TSE Lever is better than a 1* Instigating Lever, you are 100% wrong.  The 1* will hit for 2K+ and 1-shot up to a 2* level 68 Supermutant and actually hit with VATS at a 95% rate.  The TSE doesn‚Äôt have the same 1 shot capabilities, misses, breaks faster, etc. Any experienced Rifleman could tell you this.
---
I‚Äôm a bloodied build now, but you are flat out ignorant if you think there aren‚Äôt good 1* weapons, or if you think TSE is worth remotely close to 20K.  For 20K you could find an Instigating VATS crit Lever, or get close to a BE Gun.  TSE are mediocre at best, and WAY overvalued in the market. I will buy TSE to resell, but I‚Äôll never use any TS weapon.  I‚Äôd much rather have any Mutants Exploding weapon over a TSE. TS is one of the worst prefixes like Berserkers, Nocturnal, Stalkers, etc.  
---
I buy and sell weapons at a pretty high rate (sold about 90K worth of stuff yesterday) and I play Heavy and Rifleman/Commando builds.  I‚Äôd go so far as saying I know Rifleman builds about as well as anyone on here.  I‚Äôve tried all sorts of gear, and I think I have a pretty good grasp on this stuff.  Go try an Instigating Lever, or even a Gatling and see how it does for you.  If you already are running BE/BFFR weapons it won‚Äôt be an upgrade obviously, but they are VERY strong weapons.  If you find an IE Lever, you have possibly the best full health gun in the game.
---
Why even be on this Subreddit with this attitude? Just because you don't like it doesn't mean you have to try and ruin it for other people. You don't find me on the Fortnite subreddit telling people not to play
---
with all the other named uniques, each with a star, why wasn't The Fixer also a legendary?  I mean it's cool but that means that is the only weapon in the game that can have more than three legendary effects
---
I know. I'll get another 1k before then. Fallout 76 is my life right now lol
---
Does that work?
---
Risk what exactly? lol.  You won't die and lose your inventory if you run out of mats while crafting something ;)  
---
300 is vastly more than you need for anything, ever, unless you know for a fact you need that much.  Stockpiling "just in case" will max out your stash budget in no time.  
---
40 or 50 is plenty for most junk items and there's no need to have even 1 of any specific type of junk if you never use it.  
---
I can see stockpiling mats to craft ammo with, especially if you use automatic weapons.  Otherwise don't worry about it and enjoy the massive new open stash space :)
---
Yeh that got it. Thanks mate
---
Don't farm the mutants if they're 20 levels higher than you. The longer it takes you to clear a location, the less meaning the higher xp reward has in regard to time.
---
Only farm things that you can kill in under 3 seconds.
---
Don't farm fissure sites unless you bring adrenaline and can kill a SB in one burst. If you can, they go up to 800xp a pop. You get another 600-700xp from the Lv60 scorched conquerors.
---
1500xp from one fissure vs. 1500xp from 7 Super mutants.
---
Nobody farms fissures so it's the place to go if green puddles crowd west tek
---
Basically it's a tactic to get attention to the item. They will probably settle for less but it's a way to advertise that something is indeed or sale but they want to talk it over and get some trade offers instead of just caps.
---
Because it's the only one you get a plan for
---
1 code from seed bank (my task), 1 code from pump or greenhouses (teammate's task). 
---
Also possible with only one code but the servers are slow at this time
---
No problem dude. Seems to be a bug that's occured lately with some mutations not showing at all but you're getting the negatives from it nonetheless
---
I'll admit to buying some items like this just because I had the caps handy and REALLY wanted the item.
---
Huh, I've not had occasion to test this, but methinks I should....
---
that's not a reason, it didn't need to have a plan, it could have literally just been a unique legendary reward like the rest
---
Idk but i rolled 8 crap the other day and i wish i had tried something.
---
Pretty sure that's illegal?
---
If it rain all day.. I think it's good luck? If it isnt...then we can all start a NEW tradition where it,... is starting with you guys! ü§ôü§ôü§ô
---
Add "bot please don't ban this" seen a few like that.
---
Make some friends. check for a LFG or discord group where you can hook up with another player or two and explore together. The game gets a lot more fun when you have 10 or 15 people descending on the encriptid event instead of just hoping some other randoms know what to do.
---
last weeks news today
---
Every weapon class is viable, even the lowly pistol.  Your build will be more important for off meta weapons and they are best when coupled with good legendaries.  
---
But as an example a buddy of mine crafted the Vault 94 thorn armor and was shredding enemies with a drill.  The fast attack speed stacks the bleed effect and melts enemies :P
---
Gotcha. I always seem to have liquor on me, whether I remember picking it up or not.
---
I know but only one youtuber even corrected themselves on it with a update vid but all the others dont care
---
You know I was joking right? lol I didnt expect you to. Myself like everyone else doesent share my secrets because before you know it everyone will flock to them!
---
Well no fixer (sigh) I have like 4 decent weapons though that I might try to sell
---
Good to know, I'll do that from now on.
---
Yep, I reported him to PlayStation and his buddy immediately added me to a group and started harassing. I blocked both and things have been good since.
---
don't know about the rest but you can choose which way a door opens by spinning it first
---
Kinky.
---
The supressors is the best of the 2.  It's not a game changing effect but it makes you more tanky vs your target.  Good vs one individual tough enemy but not so much vs hordes of enemies.
---
Nocturnal is great... at night.  But it actually sucks donkey balls in the daytime and a gun you need to wait to use is just annoying.  Plus it's not a large enough bonus to be worthwhile.
---
FFR is one of  the best secondary effects as it is a straight DPS bonus that works all the time and doesn't require investing in perks to maximize.  Some people actually prefer it over explosive.
---
That millertime fool is always chiming in with bullshit, not my first run in with her, no life but reddit, looking for attention and acceptance cause she doesn't get it anywhere else I guess. Pretends her opinion is the only one to have, or else you're an idiot....just read her first post...shitstarter.
---
I think there‚Äôs currently a bug where they fail to load out of the world as quickly as their owners. I may be wrong about the reason why it‚Äôs happening, but what you just described is a known bug with the collections. I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords.
---
DMV. It's the new WS.
---
There's always going to be someone who thinks their stuff is made of gold. They want big money, and they want it then. 
---
I don't see the point in letting it sit for excruciatingly long periods until that one sucker comes along. I price it to move and make it up on volume. You can't carry more than 30000c anyways. (not bringing mules into the conversation mind you)
---
Wait, you mean there‚Äôs an order to the alphabet? I just thought that‚Äôs how the song went ....
---
As a bloodied build I can tell you my greatest adversaries in this game is Hit detection, frame rate drops, and lag spikes. everything else just melts if the hit connects its kind of nice lol
---
On my alt where i have a full display greenhouse as camp,they're all perfectly in order as you said. I even placed them facing the exterior so that they don't clip. Leader obviously in the central front spot in the misc middle shelf. Top shelf is weapons. Last is speialc indeed,but luck is nice in the front.
---
You cant do that tho, because in order to use sentinel you need armor which negates the effect of berserker
---
Fair enough. Thank you for the non abusive feed back. Appreciated
---
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say your wife is in the same room as the router, and is probably hard wired, never play online games over wifi, get an Ethernet cable and run it to your console
---
Agreed, even half health im plenty strong and then if i need the extra power or carry weight I can just eat a bunch of inert flux or something
---
Been playing since launch and I'm only missing two....TWO DAMMIT!
---
fwiw juice got it right the first time.. so two
---
but.. of course they dont care.. hate sells
---
I swear I commented before I saw this!  yeah you should hard wire your console, also this game performs horribly on PS4s, even pros
---
Works well for crippling and getting SBs to land.  Although I carry a bunch of shotguns - combats are my workhorses - JE for damage, VE for healing and QE for crowd control.  JE pump I use for single enemies.  Had a QE double barrel but the JE combat is outright better than it was in every way.
---
Switch to heavy weapons at times with a JE Gatling and LMG.  Those are my ranged options or for sustained damage output.  Other times and for most enemies the shotguns work well.
---
It‚Äôs a lot of fun - I really hate playing my rifle build but the shotgun is loads of fun.  No sneak just in their faces and blasting away with shotguns.
---
Of course they don't care, it's all about money for them, that's why they're so quick to put out videos it's certainly not because they see themselves as journalists lol
---
If you're on ps4 I could show, but certainly not here...
---
The forest one still happens. But like last meat week didn't see anyothers.
---
Same here I‚Äôve gave away 5 this time around. I love it that ppl think it‚Äôs still rare.
---
With a modded Hunter's Handmade (auto), Concentrated Fire, and the Commando perk cards, you should be able to lock on to their head (or other weakpoint) and do considerable damage. Also consider Tormentor under Luck. Of course, you would do a lot better if you are able to sneak but that is difficult with these events.
---
For bigger targets you may want to take damage boosting chems/drinks. Also, if you can afford to run Gunsmith and/or luck of the draw, that should extend the life of your weapon.
---
Yeah i noticed the thirst as well. I eat a corn soup about every 5 minutes and that usually keeps me topped off. Lately though my hunger will be where it usually is but my thirst will be 50 to 80% down. Just sometimes though. No chems.
---
Both are bad prefixes, but FFR is great.  FFR is better than exploding in most situations (plus you won‚Äôt blow yourself up). I agree suppressors is the better of the two.  Nocturnal goes straight to the scrip machine.
---
seriously!  the amount of people that think youtuber = reputable source is disturbing...  that said some youtubers really do the bare minimum and it shows...
---
The only one I really saw was Yong Yea ... Yeah? Ya? Him.
---
Though being fair mold is a huge deal with how sick it can get people, even causing death in those with compromised immune systems. So it was good to get the word out.
---
That being said both Yong and BGS later made it known it was only the nuka cola one and not the collectors edition. Still, it seems to be made of the same material. I can't say I know how one is fine and the other is not, but it is what it is.
---
On that note ... if you have the helmet and enjoy it. Have no mold. Don't let it get to you and just play 76 without youtube.
---
Damn 25% ffr on both. That could make them ok. I'd say suppressor cause it's not terribly useful but you don't have to wait till night.
---
If you get a night time queen take the other one for a spin.
---
Nah man on Xbox
---
There is the two scout quests, and there is Biv too of course...
---
Xbox player and I'm finding maps aren't full anymore. Sorta sucks
---
this.  There's no enemy more likely to drop one legendary item or another.  
---
Some diehard legendary farmers believe you get better odds of finding stuff you already possess.  So having other instigating weapons would increase the odds of getting more.  Whether that's true or not I guess I'll leave up to the data miners to figure out some day "P
---
Ok, I'll keep an eye out :)
---
At least three. 2 scout ones an the one with Biv.
---
Sometimes I put up things like 5.56 that I‚Äôm not really interested in selling (because I use it) at price like 3c each.  Why?  Because some people will overpay. I‚Äôve sold 5K at that price in a single purchase before. üò≥
---
sadly. I cant even join any of them. No prompt nor anything when i was there. Hop over once i sees it on the map
---
I lucked out and got an Anti-Armor Explosive combat shotgun which, when combined with Concentrated Fire 1 and Enforcer 3, I can use to cripple the mirelurk queen's legs and spouts. But that's all I use it for. If I tried to solo kill it with that weapon I'd run out of ammo and or it would break. Rather, I use a Junkie's LMG and cut through her like butter.
---
Get the Lever, not the Gauss!
---
The summer is over and school has started back up.
---
Nothing will be changed for these events. Bethesda might patch something but they will never go out of their way to change things for the better. They are done and are just moving on
---
Give it a go. Allows you to use a 2nd torso mod. I'm sure one day it may be removed, though until then why not.
---
How did you lose your eye?
---
how much prime meat do you need to solo it?
---
Yay! Congrats!
---
There wasn't one specific channel. I just Googled tips for new players and read all of the articles / watched all of the videos that it suggested. There are probably some comprehensive guides in this subreddit written for new players, so I'd search here to see if you can unearth any. Or someone else might be able to hook you up. 
---
I am on my second character now (a sneak rifle build) and whilst it's very enjoyable, my first character (a sneakyish unarmed melee build) has the edge because comparatively she is so much more capable and doesn't require as much weapon 'admin'. There is no ammo upkeep to worry about. You just put on your gauntlet and go! Melee is super cheap to fix when your weapons break, and none of my unarmed weapons break as quickly as my guns do. I am often left in the shit when my gun (that started off at over 100% repaired) breaks mid battle. I actually have to equip a 3* perk card in Intelligence just to make my gun last a little bit longer. Also, it takes me an a good few hours to scrounge up the volume of materials required to craft a few days' worth of bullets. I buy ammo wherever I can from other players. I'm not trying to put you off guns as they are a hell of a lot of fun to mod and refine, and they give you that all important distance when fighting swarms of stuff or bigger enemies. It's just something to bear in mind. More experienced gun users may have some useful tips for ammo upkeep.
---
Some say, they turn into Bruce Jenner.
---
My secrets\methods may not be just mine, I just don't want to ruin someone else good time too If I put the word out....on top of it being patched by the eyes Bethesda has on here, it would be patched tonight if Beth knew how I WAS pulling these numbers.
---
Keyword being... was, like I said, I of all people would see the nerf(and I do) to drop rates with the extreme farming methods I use.
---
Yeah but you'd have to hack by yourself while swarmed,then go for a code and find the way through residential. I don't say it's impossible ,just quite hard. You'd need a team mate that know about the codes in pump and greenhouse,hence not a random newbe.
---
Have you honestly done this before with a random raid noob?
---
Why do you care? The sales of this game in no way affect you.
---
Also why are you listening to youtubers as of they are a viable source of information? They get all there shit from reddit.
---
Wow, didn't realize that. 
---
I've scrapped 3 of them because of the damage vs carry weight üòï
---
I do something similar, but at mac's farm. Lead them by the shed, and watch them deal with a queen and her friends.
---
I'll trade you for salty plans! I got a extra tenderizer.
---
Agreed. The last time we had Meat Week I was struggling with my bloodied stealth unarmed build due to not being able to use stealth during Primal Cuts. Since then, I've been working on my Junkie's build and I'm very happy with it. I can still hit high damage numbers and if I need to take down a big target I switch perk cards around and use a Junkie's LMG which has surprisingly good DPS.
---
Now if I can just find a JFFR LMG...
---
one from each region per day they reset at 8pm eastern time...cept for savage divide it is broken and mostly only gives pumpkin house but is also supposed to give "someone to talk to"
---
You can completely ignore the insects if you wear Sentinel armor with at least two +25 Poison Resist pieces :) Unyielding armour speeds up the hacking.
---
And yes, I have.
---
I uhh. I have 780 pounds of junk.
---
I do it on my non-ammo vending chars (which means the other four) primarily cause the economy is a bit of a joke, both conceptually and in practice. Its supposed to be a post-apocalyptic "survival" game, so I can't fully wrap around the idea of some random currency being backed up by a few bots and an entrepreneurial super mutant.  Not to mention there really isn't any use for caps other than getting a specific item you want from another vendor, as you can make do with even crafted, non-legendary weapons / armor.
---
Yeah, well, if you dont find anyone willing to buy it, scrapping it may be the better option. Like most rare items, the value is entirely what the buyer decides it is.
---
Oh no...
---
Tbh most things I just list them for the suggested price. I don‚Äôt really care if anyone buys it or not.
---
it works so much better.  I used to price high out of our ignorance.  after a few days window shopping and reddit, I found you make a significant increase in return customers and overall cap per hour
---
Side note don't finish the quest and shoot legendary beasts at prime events. Maybe even some frog crawlers or crickets. Lol man i wish i could keep that thing.
---
Welcome to the club. I didn't catch on fast enough and after multiple hits the poison DOTs outpaced my stimpak spamming and I died.
---
So if I put it on my arms, what does it look like
---
The sales of the game affect the long-term support for the title. So you are wrong there.
---
Da, comrade.
---
there's plenty of risk, the point of the build is to keep your HP low, as pointed out in another comment bloodied builds struggle with ghoul hordes
---
Oh yes!
---
But it is THE reason
---
Only 32 helmets were affected. Most likely has to do with where they were stored/manufactured.
---
you can learn the mod...
---
Karma mod? Pretty sure there is only 4 mods and none are that.
---
That's neat, though I never got around to completing it myself.
---
You can use berserker with broken armor. No dr, still get the legendary effects.
---
Jesus Christ that cought me off guard.
---
You created an account just to post this? Wow, dude, get a life.
---
True enough. But the information being out there .. not a bad thing, the health issues I mentioned still stand. BGS also made a clarification rather quick after the news "broke" too. Which is good on them.
---
Though imagine if no news broke and those 32 got incredibly sick via mold or died, then the news broke. All I am saying is it was good the news got out, is all, lol.
---
Hahaha that is really sad
---
I made a much longer comment elsewhere in this thread, but I think this level of cynicism is just too black + white and belies a lack of understanding of the work required to make this a reality.
---
It isn't just a magic button you press to change the color on an item...in order for ONE skin to work across ALL weapons, devs would have to go into all 100+ texture maps for each unique model and manually edit the texture maps for each...and then be dedicated to developing alternative skins in every paint option for all subsequent weapons before they're introduced into the game. And it wouldn't be as easy as just sticking some overlay layer on if you wanted it to look good....a guitar sword is going to require a different approach to a rifle for example. And this is without even addressing mods if they're to be effected (ie. paint is applied to scopes, etc.).
---
Don't get me wrong, I think the current situation is user unfriendly and I think their power armor paint pack that applies to all models is the right direction! But applying any given paint to all weapons is not so easy as you may think and to exclusively boil it all down to "greed" is to be a bit disingenuous.
---
I wondered teh same, for npcs it makes them have super high dr then super low dr, she also says not to try it on yourself, which makes me think it will affect players
---
It‚Äôs an actually pretty good now.
---
Wow. You really need to find a better way to spend your time. 
---
Don't you like video games? I mean wouldn't you rather be playing one as opposed to posting links to old videos?
---
I hear outrage over the pending COD is a thing. Maybe you can make a Reddit account just to bash that.
---
It‚Äôs probably the same guy who made the video. Which makes it doubly sad.
---
Enjoy the nocturnal board
---
Yeah that was my first thought
---
If my health is above 20% I need to eat some spoiled meat as quick as I can
---
Fat man is underwhelming IMO. I have a two shot and against high level enemies like a behemoth, it‚Äôs practically useless. Almost 4000 damage at .6 lbs/round (+/- 1 kilo for my metric vault brothers and sisters) WITH 3x Ordinance express its just not worth it other than for the novelty. However, my quad barrel missile launcher with that tracking/homing  mod... one could argue that it is almost feasible as an AOE sneak. Additionally, at long range in PVP, it is really neat and everyone I have used it on absolutely dives for cover.
---
I am currently running a junkies exploding .50 HMG, rocking 5x addictions. It‚Äôs tantamount to an auto grenade launcher with 250 round clips and with adrenaline damage really stacks
---
dude that guy is saying ur favourite game is bad
---
the internet is a wonderful thing, for instance you could spend two seconds googling something that way you can post with certainty, instead of saying "pretty sure", because the mod definitely exists
---
Yes especially with enforcer perk, it has saved my but so so many times

Good to know, Census Violence is an easy event to do so I'll try farming that. I've got so much junk waiting to craft UGLs to learn the mods I'm missing.
---
Those 32 people had already been reached Otto individually when the story ‚Äúbroke‚Äù. I agree mold is a big deal but this story was sensationalism. That is all.
---
I get it, it's great for the player that has it, but it just means that it is the literal only viable option for a stealth sniper build
---
Nice, do you plan to organize them in any way?
---
I did alphabetical split by weapons, utility, SPECIAL
---
With the middle being last to be in the physical middle.
---
By ‚Äòthat guy‚Äô you mean you, right? 
---
And why on earth should I care what you think of FO76?
---
if you were honest with yourself you would realize you have never once been above 20% while fighting ghouls, in fact ghouls are like kryptonite to bloodied builds, at least the ones that use rads to maintain, because of the rads they give it is nearly impossible for a bloodied build not to die from the radiation alone
---
we gettin trolled up in here
---
Clickbait
---
&gt; Even the feral ghouls have left.
---
Well, all except Bernie Sanders, obviously.
---
I‚Äôm not sure but there are maybe a dozen waiting for me in pop boy
---
get killed thats only way i know of
---
By being killed. Drop off your junk in your STASH, take off all your armor, and find someone to kill you easily
---
  Next up: file divorce papers at the courthouse mission.
---
He's not aggressive, but he tends to bark when they come to the house. He loves everyone, he's just prejudice haha. It's only when they're really dark too. Must look odd to him!
---
Yeah I get obliterated by Yao Guais. Especially the prime meat event when I'm drumming, and one comes up to me, then kills me before I can get my weapon out.
---
I just steer clear of that one particular prime meat location üòÖ
---
I honestly thought it was intentional fml
---
Honestly that doesn‚Äôt sound so awful, to sleep on that is. During the apocalypse
---
Thanks, I do run with Gunsmith level 3 and Concentrated Fire level 2. I can do decent damage in sneak but out of it I feel as weak as a kitten when up against stronger enemies, especially I get swarmed. I was thinking of switching my Rifleman perks to Commando to quicken the pace of the big enemy murdering. However, I get the shudders just thinking about the volume of bullets I'd need to constantly craft to keep that build going.
---
I'm only a level 117 and I can make handmade, if u want one I will be more than happy to make u one for free if ur on ps4.
---
I'm sad cause of it. I enjoy this game a lot, yea it has a lot of bugs but I enjoy it. I want more new players to come play the game I've always wanted to be online coop or mmo eccentric.
---
Anything Bethesda tries to fix it feels like it's pointless and people don't realize the game has changed a lot since it launched an think its still in the same state as it was during launch and completely ignore the game cause these youtubers keep bad mouthing it just because of some minor issues with the game or company or merchandise branding in the name of fallout. Some of us are very passionate about the fallout franchise and this is our first real chance to play with friends and new people who never played a fallout game before and tell them about the lore in other games an stuff and all I see I hate videos on 76 and it just makes me mad cause it's not even true on what they're saying about one of the only few remaining franchises I actually genuinely enjoy still.
---
Working on this now, so I envy your collection! I sometimes find them at camp vendors but a, they're too pricey and b, I wouldn't feel the same satisfaction by just buying them. I did buy one yesterday from a vendor because he had it at just 40 caps so I couldn't resist! When I find that same one I will pay it forward and sell it for cheap, too.
---
Pop on a period card that reduces crippling. It's a lifesaver!
---
Wow *perk can't stand this phone's autocorrect
---
5.56 ammo.... people sell it for 1 cap regularly, I buy. If they sell if for 2 caps, I leave, because I have no doubt I'll find it for 1 cap later on. There's no room for movement on ammo. 
---
I sell all of my ammo at 1 cap regardless of what it is for the simple fact I don't need it and I don't want to carry it around.
---
No, they do not affect him in anyway. People will buy the game regardless as ‚Ä¶ you know. The game does not come with mold. Just the one model of that helmet.
---
So unless this story impacted sales .. which we have 0 way of knowing unless BGS says something. It's just conjecture.
---
whoe whoe whoe. one step at a time tiger
---
Thank, very kind! But I‚Äôm on PC and hoping for a legendary drop.
---
Congrats hopefully there were no unintended bugs or glitches lol
---
jeez im just the messenger u dont have to shoot me
---
I hope u get it, hope it's a two shot explosive, two bullets for the price of one..lol
---
"Sensationalism. That is all."
---
I agree. Both points are valid, the news getting out and the fact the story blew up far more than it should have.
---
Now I'm going to go before I get anymore down votes :/, lol.
---
Obviously it's trash half the time, but nocturnal isn't too bad in the dark until you get something better. I run bloodied heavy guns but had a nocturnal explosive gatling drop and it does exactly the same damage as a 1* bloodied gatling at night, a bit more with demo expert.
---
The GL will be a lot easier to mod though, unless you've been lucky enough to have the UGL plans drop.
---
If you have Bear Arms you could carry both. I carry a few guns I rarely use just because they're fun to shoot occasionally.
---
Oh no! He is? What am I going to do?
---
Like this is the first I heard of this. Like there hasn't been the entirety of the YouTube "video game review" community that copy pasted their script from each other that did this a year ago. 
---
Oh and like what is YouTube? I mean I am only slightly more out of the loop than you are.
---
No, only 32 helmets were sold.
---
You have to move around. If you stay on the drum or the spit, it gives you credit one but then starts going backwards. The only time it's failed for me is when someone is staying in the drum the whole time. It takes everybody running around like crazy people
---
It‚Äôs the broader theme of these YouTubers being misleading for clicks. They have a wide reach and a lot of people haven‚Äôt bought because they think the game is ‚Äúa broken mess‚Äù or ‚Äúunplayable‚Äù. Neither of which are true. Yes there are bugs, but for the most part everything works very well and it‚Äôs a lot of fun.
---
Same thing
---
A power armor drill fist as a power armor unarmed weapon would actually make me use power armor even if it can't have legendary affixes.
---
That's the thing, it does move fast, and you make good money. I price well and my stuff never sits around. Last week I bought the letters plan for 9300 caps and a blue nurse outfit for 6000 caps, and then last night when I logged off I still had 23k caps. 
---
Waiting for 1 person to buy a specific 3 star 10k item will take longer to net you 10k than selling a few decent legendaries at lower prices.
---
Sorry, maybe this will inspire you and others to actually run the encrypted event
---
Someone has a piece of armour in their vendor for 2500, so I message them asking if they'd take 1800. They popped back and sold it to me via trade. It's a multi-player game but people only want to interact with vendors.
---
Dumping on Fallout 76 is guaranteed clicks for YouTubers and gaming press outlets, which is ironically a surefire sign the game has enjoyed moderate success and is still being followed in case things turn around for it.
---
All respect to sly but I wouldn't say plan your build in advance so much as use nukes and dragons to familiarize yourself with the cards. 
---
There is too much to contemplate when creating a build. I'd just consider your first play through as fun and a learning experience. Still it's helpful to know about which weapon is in which category, and what cards to look forward to.
---
Everybody said you can't get it. So i guess the Internet is not very reliable.
---
You‚Äôve both contracted bone worms!
---
Congrats
---
Another player needs to kill you. Too bad you can't just pay your bounty off at a train station or something.
---
Yeah no. Mutants, Anti-Armor and others that are minimal or zero effort absolutely do not need to stack to 50% max. 
---
Berserkers yes though - push it much higher. Trade off is serious.
---
Yeah, but Wolf Horde is useless anyway, I've never seen a legendary boss there. Leader of the Pack is great for its 3x scrip, though.
---
I can agree that the youtubers are still talking crap about the game in terms of the beta bugs and shortly after. That being said.
---
I see no lack of people coming to the forum every single day, new players. Saying that the game is something they enjoy and is worth playing for them. I mean the game will continue to get bad press .. in some ways it's deserving as it still has bugs from fall out 4 a 2015 game. 
---
On that note .. if you and others are enjoying the game good please continue ‚Ä¶ enjoy the game. Avoid youtubers that are "game news" and just watch the content that is within the realm of positivity toward the game you like. Otherwise we get more threads like this for me to tackle :/.
---
Great thread.  The other question IMHO is why cant I use a mod i find or is there a way?  I have yet to be able to find it.
---
Something very valuable can be a reward for Wolf Horde, so fine with me if I‚Äôm the only one who bothers. üòÄ
---
I get about 5 dailies per day, some never appear. It seems for some of them you have to visit the same section of the map. I‚Äôll have to run down the others.
---
Been in that perdicament 1 time grabed from a resorce crate that said steal next thing i know no one showed on the map and seen i was wanted..was like well fuck so stashed my shit got out of passive but still took me 3hrs to track someone down. I told them my situation they were more then willing to help. A lvl 15 gets super sledged by a lvl 86 in full PA
---
If you do catch a bargain and decide to hop over to PS4, give me a shout if you ever fancy teaming up. I always like reading your comments in this sub and it'd be nice to hang out! I play solo 99.9% of the time, but have been enjoying teaming up with others over Meat Week, so I'm hoping to befriend some like-minded folk now that I'm coming out of my single-player shell :-)
---
Hmm i play solo all the time except when i feel like being social and then i take part in scorched earth
---
Just buy the stuff you want lmao
---
Reminds me of the far harbor dog vendor
---
Nice! I wish my dad had had more patience with all the bugs.
---
Neither are very good, but I would say suppressors
---
Only charge a premium on good/God rolls, everything else is average price. Takes time to find certain rolls, usually added into the price along with the 10% Bethesda tax.
---
There is plenty of time to build up scrip before then
---
Alright, I haven't tried making sure it and the acid are both in my inventory, thanks for the help.
---
Junk is pretty easy to acquire so craft away
---
No
---
7 years?  But she was worth the wait.  She is a keeper.  Most ladies have problem with geeky stuff.  She was a trooper.  Rain and all.  Congratulations to the both of you!
---
Friend of mine had a "skunk problem" a few years ago.  Also had a "nosy neighbor", and also had a NFA legal suppressed MP5 with a laser sight. 
---
It was a "3 fer" : Popped 4 skunks, no smell, and the neighbor went bonkers when he saw the guy stalking them in his yard one night. 
---
Neighbor had a complete meltdown when he called local police, but didn't know you don't get NFA approval without a sign-off from the Chief LEO; so a patrol stopped by, had some coffee, and told neighbor all was fine - my friend was on his own property, shooting away from anyone into a ditch, and not making any noise.
---
Which would have bought you then entire contraptions DLC. "Live service" has been the biggest over sell/under deliver thing to happen to video games.
---
One easy thing I would like to see is you bring in a non legendary item to murmgh and she makes it legendary for double the usual scrip rate. Basically 300 scrip to randomly generate effects on whatever piece you give her. Still rng but at least you pick the piece.
---
The spawn locations seem fixed, go at them.
---
Had that happen to a group of us that killed the last Prime creature with about a minute and a half to spare.
---
I had one where I got a tse gatling plasma, a boy can dream
---
someone has to kill you.
---
Last one I did today, was 3 on drums and spits, and 10 doing jack. I had two turn ins of meat, like 6 greens, and a ton of chunks. Two of us were doing the work, but it still barely hit the second mark. After that, we got berated by the people not doing anything for not maxing it out. 
---
I'm done with this event.
---
You had to find someone? most usually find me when I goof up and get wanted.
---
Go into the atom shop and download the free personal terminal that you can build in your camp. It shows occasional updates on new events, and keeps track of the reset time for 3 of the daily missions so you know when they can be completed again.
---
Just because you're presented with a mission doesn't mean you can actually do it. If you steamroll your way through the starting quests you'll end up at a point where you're like level 20 and the missions will take you into areas that have level 40+ enemies. When this happens, go back to the lower levels and continue exploring new locations, participate in events, capture workshops, and look for sidequests to help you level up.
---
Speaking of workshops. The game mentions that you open yourself up to PVP, but doesn't really explain it at all. When you spend 25-30 caps to claim a workshop, your player icon shows up next to it on the map, and other people can try to claim it from you through PVP.  However, the can only attack you inside the radius of the workshop, so you can use that to your advantage.
---
Claim one, set up some resource extractors, and the get TF out of there for 20 minutes or so while they do there thing. Fast travel back every once in a while to gather the collected resources, and then GTF out again. If someone contests your workshop and you're not in the area there's a ~1 minute period before you lose the claim and the other person takes over, so if you don't want to get in a fight just ignore the notification and stay out of the area.
---
Other than fast travel, there's almost nothing you need to spend caps on in the early game. You might be tempted to sell all the random weapons and armor you collect from enemies, but you're much better off scrapping them to learn mods (and gain scrap) so that when you find a weapon you actually want to use you'll be able to mod it to do more damage, add a scope, etc.
---
this is the first im hearing of it
---
Yeah it happened to me to, I basically just laughed in their faces but I still reported them as this shit needs to stop, Bethesda asked me for details but said thay could not let me know if they had done anything about it, so who knows maybe Bethesda just say they will punish the players and to what extent so that begs the question what is the point of reporting anyone, I beleive these same individuals made it back to my camp and destroyed my fusion generator as it was completley smashed, can't prove it though.
---
I‚Äôm on pc btw
---
Had that happen to me as soon as I ran out of wood.
---
I thought you were saying it didn't exist, but even still I'm pretty sure you can learn it, but maybe not, I have been wrong before
---
My son said he ran across the same ones last week. Go in passive mode to keep them from griefing you. Then if you don‚Äôt fight back they can‚Äôt destroy your camp or you.
---
That was my first thought but I checked and had 67 wood scrap
---
Ya i had to track somone willing to kill me months bk as all pvp players were not really around on xbox one as 80% are all about pve so tracking someone down at 4am was a pain in the ass.
---
Hello autobot, do you maybe play fallout 76 ? The whole server is empty it would be lovely to play with someone.
---
There is a way. You have to be on the workbench, go to craft and then go to the mod you have so you can attach it. It doesn't require any perks. Just slap it on.
---
Hi, Sorry for the delayed response. I am still having trouble. I'll be making a new post with a video of what is happening
---
I'm on PC and I'm 99% sure I've got one you can have (as long as no one's bought it out of my vendor and I just didn't notice) I should be on from 6 to 9 Pacific time tonight. Gamer name is the same as my Reddit name
---
Let me know if you'd like to play , there's literally no one else on the server.
---
Add Reaper1944 I'll join you
---
Lol all i need is my meat hook. I use it with chamelon to sneak up on 3* gouls 1 hit kill everytime
---
FYI Bobblehead one is USING them. So you need to find 2 whole sets if you want the atoms and full display.
---
&gt; I really do think that Outer worlds will be the straw that breaks the camels back for FO76.
---
I highly doubt it. It's yet another Obsidian game everyone is gonna praise, but not actually play. And unlike Borderlands 3 it has no marketing, no fanbase (New IP) and it looks like crap (visually), so you can bet it won't sell well and as a result won't have any meaningful impact on the online in any other game.
---
I have it.  Not sure how I got it, but I like using it and I hope it doesn't just go away at some point...
---
I would feel a lot safer with 2FA especially since our account name is displayed to everyone in game.
---
PS4? Probably the same kids everybody else is having trouble with I blocked them so I won‚Äôt be in the same server again with them.
---
are you using missile launcher or are you using gatling gun with explosive perk?
---
I got a 2 shot missile launcher and a 2 shot grenade launcher. one of my favorite characters to play on but its very expensive
---
At max level (45) the most of any component you need is steel (144 units)

That's strange. I seem to get both bog quests daily quite often.
