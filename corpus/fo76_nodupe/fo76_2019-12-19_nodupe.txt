They 90% of the time die.

In between 2 toons i was farming about 400 to 500 script a day xD saving as much as i can for dlc for a legendary bow if they make them legendary.
---
The logs are considered "world spawns" I believe, there's not a container to open. Same concept though. If you search for loot spawn or world spawn, there area couple older posts that go into more detail.
---
Yea, its a space ship, not something you see everyday in west virginia. Oh well, you can ignore it in your game. Power to you!
---
At 15 my brother convinced me to help him try to take 1 ..........it didn‚Äôt work out
---
That's really good and you sound like a really good player I  would absolutely love to practice pvp with you! I keep my tesla rifle on me for stealth boy users. As for I see a sign of stealth boy using as a sign of a trash player who deserves to die in a trash way :)
---
Yeah that may be true but I should be getting a higher spawn rate when I‚Äôm on my own world. Going through big bend and only having 2 holiday scorched spawn is ridiculous.
---
Am I doing something wrong.
---

---
Go there, kill all the enemies and the scorchbeast without touching any ore. Fissure site jump to die and go back to the start. Grab the ore. I grab ore and nothing spawns and then if I grab a second I might get two scorched but then I go through and continue that but no more scorched spawn. 
---
I know it‚Äôs better done in a team but I was wanting to try it solo but it didn‚Äôt seem to work at all.
---
No, having a private world doesn't increase your spawn rates on anything, and it shouldn't. You just don't have to share the world, that's it.
---
Since I roleplay, most of.my favourites are so because they fit to the character. 
---
For example, a bloodied faster fire 10mm. 
---
A bloodied faster fire reduced weight lever action for my rifleman.
---
And all the.revolvers you may like. My favourite is my Western, instigating faster fire plus vats benefits. Fun revolver. 
---
And then you have the dream weapons of many, like my bloodied explosive 50 Cal reduced weight. Or my vampire faster swing +1 combat knife. 
---
I have been playing since release, so, I have seen them godrolls... Still have some jewels in the stash I have forgotten about, sure.
---
Do you honestly think the two guys working on this game has time for that???
---
&gt; During maintenance today, we increased the chances that Santatron will find Holiday Gifts during the Holiday Scorched event. So through the end of the month, you should get at least 1 gift per hour on average, if not more. ***It's still possible to have a bad string of luck, but Santatron should be much more generous overall now.***

I used to run away, too!  Last night I single-handedly took on (and bested) 3 at the same time near Fissure Prime.  It was almost as rewarding as the loot!
---
Awesome! Thanks! The month has just been stupid busy so far and with all the sickness going around I haven‚Äôt been able to get on much. Hoping to change that this weekend!
---
What I‚Äôm trying to say is that the spawn rate should be higher because nobody has went through that area of the world before you. Hell, if I go on a public server, I‚Äôll get the same low spawn rates because others have already been in the area or still are in the area. Since the spawn rates have been so low for me the last two days, I‚Äôll just let my santatron collect gifts for me and hope for the best ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I‚Äôm not gonna go around wasting ammo because only one holiday scorched appeared.
---
"only so many" in my experience is about 7,000 without trying and around 15,000 if you make an effort.  Maybe you want to spend more than that in the atom store, but that is your decision.
---
You said "Cosmetics should be behind an effort barrier".
---
They are.
---
&gt; Eventually your efforts become wasted.
---
What do you mean by that?  What is wasted?
---
Well, it is great for scaling cliffsides when the fires pinch you against the mountains
---
Lock them if you are scrooge.
---
This is the way
---
I just want to bring some logic to your argument...
---
I don't recall anyone asking for this change. It felt like it came out of nowhere. As an avid NW player myself, I can tell you I know exactly 1 person who was really excited about this. Everyone else was either silent on the subject or openly dismayed.
---
On the flip side, a LOT of people hated the change. Your argument is that the people that don't even play Nuclear Winter hated it. My question is... How would people who don't even play NW know about it? It was one of the shortest-lived features ever implemented in 76. By the time it started showing up on YouTube and Reddit, Bethesda had already made the decision to get rid of it based on the negative response. I don't see how you can try to make the argument that the opponents of this change were the people who don't play NW. They wouldn't know about the change.
---
&gt; someone will pick the lock
---
And become wanted.  Wanted players are a rare an interesting resource.
---
I'm coming.  I'm coming.  Wanted players are the rarest resource in the game.
---
Any lock at all is going to discourage most if not all people, since picking the lock makes them Wanted regardless of difficulty
---
When you click play with team it should show an option to make the server team only right below the private server tab. 
---
Just to make sure a lot of people don't notice that. I had to use that for it to allow them to stay.
---
Seven is out now, released early cause of the film. I have spoken.
---
It can be discovered, but something is definitely buggy about it.  On my primary character, I've discovered it separately from the workshop, yet it didn't trigger the atom challenge.
---
I submitted a ticket about it a few months ago and they asked a series of scripted unrelated questions like "what time did this happen" ... I never did reply.
---
Recently using an alt character I've gone to the same area, and now I cannot get it to "discover" the town, just the workshop.  Garrr.
---
Same. It's easy to collect the other crops. Few gourds at camp are needed!
---
Ive herd February but knowing Bethesda they mean February 2021
---
Wait I thought you were fucking around are lead pipes really meta?
---
sorry, I was just joking :)  See my next reply (below).  I do think it'd be a fun quest tho if they actually had it.
---
‚ÄúPrivate server tab‚Äù???
---
What even is that .. the only way I know to get into a server is:
---
- go to main menu.     
---
- open Social.      
---
- invite friends to team.      
---
- go to main menu.      
---
- select Play with Team.     
---
- select Private Server from the game mode screen.     
---
If there‚Äôs another way to do it please help, because we‚Äôve spent the past two weekends trying to figure it out.
---
White responders fire helmet

BE w/RW? FR?  can't remember

BE fixer the first day it was added to Purveyor. Sold for pennies because I had no idea of value. 
---
Either Bloodied Explosive or Berserker Explosive w/250drwr fixer (out of town and can't remember primary slot)
---
Must be a responder ü§£
---
I guess I'll have to try that.
---
Maybe? I don't know many who still play, but I can probably find someone
---
We all want it now! HaHa. Fuck it's a big Franchise, it's safe to say the whole gaming community is waiting to see what happens too!
---
Maybe you should try not doing 4 man premade all the time mr. toyz7..try signing up solo, it might be more of a challenge
---
I‚Äôve noticed this strange bug shortly before p16 dropped.  I first saw it the weekend before, after killing a legendary, having it turn into a meat pile, seeing no special loot and going into transfer to investigate further.  Lo and behold, there was the gun, plus some ammo and meat that didn‚Äôt appear on quick inspection.
---
It‚Äôs happened sporadically since then, and seems to be tied to some form of server lag.  I think it‚Äôs a byproduct of whatever they did to prevent transfer of items back onto a corpse.
---
If you get this bug/lag, server hop and it should clear up.  Still, I now double tap R to go into the transfer menu and loot all.  It‚Äôs quicker during a fight, and I just dump what I don‚Äôt want when the action is over.  It also works great on those corpses that are rolling downhill or sinking underwater.
---
Lol true
---
Okay...
---

---
On PC I‚Äôm still having this problem .. any fix on the horizon?
---
Do we have a cohesive list of where the power boxes are? I always randomly stumble upon them and never remember where they are.
---
Thanks Santa Leatherface.  Can I sit on your lap?
---
invite everyone while they are on the main menu hit
---
 play with team when ready
---
Adventure private and nuclear winter should pop up.
---
High light private it should have an option for team only turn it on 
---
Then just take them into the server with you
---
Hope this helps you
---
Except that's not how the legendary spawns work at all, so. Still no.
---
This sounds great in theory, however, I had 5 workshops and my camp with santatrons for about 5-6 hours and never got one gift. Yes, i had them all set to collect gifts. I am yet to find a single gift in my santatron on private world or public. 
---
Ive come to terms with the fact that I must have been a bad boy this year and Santa is punishing me for it. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It HAS to be RNG. I‚Äôve seen this mentioned before over the past week but I don‚Äôt believe the spawn rates have changed. I believe they are random. I‚Äôve had a few hours where it seemed like 1 in 50 were legendary (‚Äúclearly nerfed!‚Äù) and then I‚Äôll have a run where there are two of them coming at me at once with another one just within my line of sight (‚Äúclearly buffed!‚Äù). That would even out the 1 in 50 to what I believe is the actual chance, something like 1 in 25.
---
Yes it does. It could be more but I‚Äôm not a full bloodied  unarmed build.
---
What do you mean ‚Äúoption for team only‚Äù?
---
Where is this shown? I‚Äôve had the same advice from many people but I simply don‚Äôt see any options on the screen in the game mode select screen, just the three boxes. Nothing else on screen.
---
Is this a PC v XBOX thing?
---
2 star instigating ffr handmade, doesn‚Äôt sound so great but it‚Äôs broken, all bullets give the instigating bonus on the first trigger pull.
---
With the sneak commando perks it hits for 700 at full health and liquifies everything.  If I run at half health with adrenal reaction it‚Äôs about 9k per second.
---
You mentioned someone instigating you to PvP. I get that. But your first paragraph was still on the subject of assaulting low-levels.
---
Got my first last week and I've played since day one. I even recorded it.
---
Thanks
---
NICE! I just need one more Royal Jelly to finish. Keep getting ‚Äújunk‚Äù version but not the ‚Äúaid‚Äù one.

Are you walking over those shiny areas at West-Tek that looked like they‚Äôre coated in gasoline?
---
Yuh I have a power armor I‚Äôll be ready
---
There's a note mentioning ghouls forming a community that sounds suspiciously like underworld.
---
It's possible that we could meet some of 3's more famous ghouls before they travelled east.
---
My Santatron has never had a choice of what he collects. Has it always been that way?
---
Idk what god tier armor ur using but i have trouble not gettin killed especially by poison if theres a mirelurk king i cant even outstim the damage
---
Better get ready to drop a shittttt ton of alcohol!

Shit i have to buy santa now for a good beard...
---
I mean, yes and no. I don't know about all platforms but at least on console, we're pretty good about policing ourselves. 
---
Like, yeah, there's a hefty amount of trolling going on; but a lot of the times the actual, toxic players are hated by all, but I also am pretty sure we've got the lowest number of players out of all three so maybe that just allows us to be pretty familiar with it?
---
Right. That's why you can make it to the top 5 consistantly by hiding in a bush.
---
Naw its if I go near the building after around 10 second I get the effect and then if I run away from the building up the hill and then drink water it goes away. I didn‚Äôt try going inside.

If you didn't know, the consumable one can only be found at 3 locations. It's the only way to get them.

That is dedication lol
---
Yesterday and the day before, I only received one Santatron gift over a 5 hour span. Hope you're right...
---
If you‚Äôre going to be on around 12 AM EST tonight (tomorrow) I‚Äôll hop on and buy one.
---
The area I‚Äôm talking about isn‚Äôt inside, it‚Äôs outside. Lots of areas near the guard entrance and inside by the cooking pits have this shiny ‚Äúgas on the ground‚Äù look. I‚Äôve seen this effect when passing through it, though I don‚Äôt think those areas are particularly flammable.
---
Oh yeah was saying I didn‚Äôt try going inside, but naw I was around back goin to the rear entrance.
---
Its a festivus miracle!
---
***Assault?***
---
It‚Äôs a **core function** of the game. And the player is warned *each and every time* they attempt to claim or contest a Workshop that PvP will be flagged.  Not just the first time. Not just the first five times. 
---
**Every single time.**
---
There is never a requirement to claim a workshop (outside of some occasional Atom Challenges). 
---
And yes, it‚Äôs far better for a player to learn the full risks at a low level when they‚Äôre just losing some ‚Äòwood &amp; steel‚Äô instead of at a higher level when they would lose harder to acquire junk.
---
I have an alt that has never flagged for PvP. Never took Pacifist off, never picked a player-owned lock, never claimed or contested a workshop (or even entered the area), never even teamed up with anyone. And that alt has been leveled up to over 100 just fine. 
---
PvP is 99.99% optional*, and the game gives you plenty of warnings about how it is initiated and how to avoid it.
---
Criticizing someone for contesting a Workshop is ridiculous, especially when we still have the Syringer/Nuka Mine bug. 
---
Now *that* I would consider assault. Using a glitch to affect the game and other players in a completely unintended manner.
---
You have mods on that aren‚Äôt updated? From several months ago?
---
Managed to get a plasma grenade plan out of a stolen gift earlier, then proceeded to steal more, it's great.
---
I got it yesterday.
---
Jus play the fucking game
---
Nope, never had any mods actually, this is even a clean installation on a new PC.
---
lol
---
I know Pete plays, but does Todd?
---
If so, it must be incognito. He‚Äôd be getting his camp nuked constantly, I‚Äôm sure.
---
Very odd, I have never had this happen.
---
Ha I see plenty of traffic (from assholes taking up all the free stuff good luck trying to sell the 5 ivory grip plans LOL)
---
Play legit or find a different game please. You ruin the game for other people when you do this.

How about... no.

Are you seriously trying to get your account banned?

I won't be able to get a screenshot for a bit but I'm on ps4 it pops up just like the auto fill option does for nuclear winter
---
I have varying levels of success at times, but it's been cool. I've probably gotten over 100 legendaries myself. Plus I think there have been an increase in legendary enemies as a whole.
---
Malcolm McDowell as President Eden.
---
Auto fill option for Nuclear Winter?
---
I‚Äôve never seen such a thing either ... when I click NW from the mode select screen it immediately finds a world and launches the game.
---
I‚Äôm so confused.
---
They target a player as soon as they become hostile to the owner.
---
If there's a way to exploit something, people will find it.
---
we all know who we [want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCsMKypvmB0) don't lie to yourself
---
To be honest, they did get 20 caps out of it... but spent more on the claim attempt, so he lost out a bit there. Some raiders are looking for quick &amp; easy junk, and it does pay off sometimes. 
---
Did he do it multiple times or move on after the first kill and found no loot?
---
Assholes are still picking the locks since a 5 cap bounty is meaningless.
---
Don't click it it should be right under that before you launch it
---
I don't think you understand.  you can get a bad rng result that yields few legendaries regardless of the presence of other players.
---
Sounds like someone who hasn't played a NW match with less than 35 people
---
Locks only keep out honest people
---
Is it an item you select, or a keypress?
---
Hey, one step closer to that Atom Challenge. 
---
Bethesda is **encouraging** us to take out Wanted players with these bounties.
---
I come across frozen enemies like this regularly. If you leave the area then return usually they are unfrozen and you can then kill them.
---
The Great Canvas Shortage of 2018 is still prevalent in 2102 it seems.
---
The game warns you that you can be attacked if you claim a workshop. 
---
Are these ‚Äònew players‚Äô incapable of reading a pop-up screen?
---
I only complain about the pvp damage cap that killed pvp for me if some1 attacks a workshop of mine they can keep it
---
Just when I think people can't get any dumber, I see this.
---
I think if you leave the pvp area, you should be out of pvp..
---
How much you willing to pay? I can get you whatever.
---
You don‚Äôt ever ‚Äòneed‚Äô to claim a Workshop. It‚Äôs 100% optional. 
---
It‚Äôs a risk/reward mechanic. And there aren‚Äôt many of those in this game.
---
No I understand completely. Yeah the spawn rate may be determined by a RNG but since this is an ‚Äúevent‚Äù there should be a minimum number that spawn. I shouldn‚Äôt have to waste caps fast traveling to say big bend tunnel and then have no legendaries that spawn. That would be a complete waste of ammo and caps.
---
i got them, did not place or deal with camp yet since our groups still running nw
---
That's what she said.
---
Ahhhh I gotcha
---
Cool, just wondering if it ACTUALLY reset or not, dope, thank you!
---
he goes on a murder spree when he gets to Watoga I watched him for an hour one time murdering waves of robots until he ran out of town towards big bend tunnel at double speed
---
But bloodied weapons are even bloodier, right?
---
Key press when you highlight private
---
Dude, awesome ::: I gotta go watch that some day
---
I remember when Pete had his nuked. But I haven't heard anyone mention playing with Pete anymore after that, I wonder if he still gets on
---
it seemed to of reset a few minutes early for me (2-3) i had a cruddy 103 exp match that ended at 7:10 est and got the reward
---
Ok thanks! I‚Äôll look for it again!
---
It may hit harder in first hit (no mathematician here) , but for a long term fight like Sbq no
---
I love this event. I‚Äôm getting higher quality legendaries than usual too. I picked up a junkies handmade, bloodied meat hook, and a couple of other decent pieces worth a few thousand caps off these festive bastards. I expected nothing but scrip to be honest, but this has been pretty nice so far.
---
They sound cooler, but I don't think they provide anymore damage then something that is not bloodied when you are eating adrenal serum.
---
Mordortek and I got marsupials
---
Yes definitely fewer than first day
---
Not really if they survive the first hit than Bloodied is better
---
I may be wrong, that's why I'm asking.
---
I believe one of the community managers said they were investigating "holes in the ground" post patch 16. I don't know if this is one of them.
---
Or furious I mean.
---
Haha no
---
Not exactly. Bloodied and Adrenal are separate functions and stack together. 
---
And Instigating only works on the first hit and only if they are at full health (so, sometimes twice on a Legendary when they heal back up). 
---
Bloodied works on each attack. 
---
On a low damage, high attack rate weapon (like a Minigun) Instigating is terrible. 
---
On a high damage, low attack rate weapon (like a Super Sledge or Harpoon Gun), Instigating is awesome. 
---
Arsenal just adds in some damage bonus if you‚Äôre at low health.  But if you have the right build, that‚Äôs just a ‚Äòlittle extra‚Äô that may not make a big difference with a high damage Instigating weapon.
---
Combat Rifle minimum spawn level is 20.
---
Yes
---
Only for the initial shot (if that), after which substantial difference.
---
Just yesterday I had an instigating fixer drop from the purveyor and I decked it out to the same mods my bloodied combat rifle has.
---
I did a side by side comparison and found that the combat rifle would kill a scorched in one shot while sneaking (torso shot, adrenal perk and gun fu unequipped) however for whatever reason the fixer would not on the initial shot.
---
Same health on my end, same level scorched on theirs.
---
Very basic testing, but I decided to keep the combat rifle on the old weapon wheel and the fixer is now stashed hahaha.
---
Can confirm, got it from a large gift
---
oh, didnt know about that. Might be the case. Because i was falling in the specific spot. Although at the end of the video that thing sudenly stopped happening on that spot.
---
You mean you don‚Äôt have any plans for it or you don‚Äôt think it exists?
---
Well that‚Äôs actually not true. My toon has Adrenal, an instigating pipe revolver shows the same damage number as bloodied, but when I equip them the bloodied shows higher damage number. Instigating is great yes, but if something takes more than two shots to kill, bloodied wins.
---
Nuclear Winter Battle Royale.
---
You still need to have low health for adrenal to kick in. If you're going to roll with low health, you may as well use bloodied.
---
Just wanna say I lurk your stream a lot and love the content keep it up ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Oh, thanks. There's not too many people on my friends list that are into NW, maybe that's why I'm just seeing this thing now.
---
I believe there is a cap on the damage Furious can scale to. So in a long term fight bloodied would give you more steady damage resulting in more damage .Lets not forget that there seems to be some miss chance in melee as well do any swing and miss would reset your counter on a Furious Weapon . Adrenal Reaction is Fun tho I like using it with my QE Harpoon with my bloodied heavy character
---
Make a 1√ó1 room no door and every so remove the wall xD this sounds lile fun
---
You don‚Äôt have to finish all the tadpole ones to move on.
---
I don't see it in my Plans
---
LOL....then they can pick the lock and be trapped inside of my box.
---
I have several on xbox
---
WWR armour...Have 96 weapons on me atm üòÇ
---
I was max. Down to 2k. You‚Äôre better than me!
---
Instigating is +100% against full health targets (read as first hit) and then normal after that. Bloodied will peak at +80% for all hits if your health stays below 20%
---
So on the first hit, Instigating is the winner, on the 2nd, 3rd ... Nth hits, Bloodied wins out. For PVE most things die after 1 hit if you've min/maxed your build, so Instigating might be fine for 90% of the game, but once you get into things like SBQ, Encryptid, etc. Bloodied will deliver more damage over the duration of the fight.
---
Personally I've found Junkies to be a happy medium. +50% damage all the time (assuming 5 addictions) and I get to run at full health.
---
Combat rifle minimum level is 20. So it either wasn't HIM that killed you, or he was shooting something else.   
---
BUT - the way PVP mechanics works in adventure mode, all weapons regardless of level "Scale" to maximum level for purposes of PVP only. So the level 7 guy with a level 5 hunting rifle does the damage that a (unperked) level 50 hunting rifle does to his PVP opponent. Add a few chems in the mix and a VATS headshot...  
---
BUT- This should STILL only do the max damage per shot of PVP (Capped for "balance" ) of 110 hp. (Which applies to ALL WEAPONS)   
---
Because Beth hates snipers in Adventure mode.   
---
My guess? Either he was hacking, or (far more likely), he was the bait-guy in a four man squad whom you didn't see, and they ALL shot you the moment after you swung your hammer. :)
---
But, for players on the low cap wise, a furious with adrenal would be more cost effective.   The bloodied market is rediculous at times.
---
Hehe yeah, luckily had a buddy that got me one :) but I definitely agree, can't wait for wastelanders to drop, let us get some new weapons already and fix duping
---
Pipboy is working but i can‚Äôt seem to repair weapons on my one character. Bench nor repair kits,option isn‚Äôt there. Also pc
---
I fucked up when I made the topic, I mean furious, not instigating.
---
If your on pc and need wood i can hook you up
---
very nice build and strat you will love if.
---
I'm at about 75k so don't feel bad. I craft serums and sell back as many calls so I can over and over again. This was after selling 1 doing for 30k to 2 of my mules. I now have several of ever plan. It was the snally gaster that kept me buying. I couldn't get it until 70k or so.
---
I am on PC but I'm good on wood. Just noticed an oddity that the logs near my camp I couldn't loot even after the maintenance.
---
On the trial weekend, I was in a building, and there was a random guy trying to drop one from the machine, and after 3-4min, while I was looting the building, I saw the come here emote, and the guy fucking got it. Lol
---
I think it was in arktos pharma
---
Ahh yah its odd like that and no worries!
---
I‚Äôm having the same issue lol
---
What happens if you attack him?
---
I was near a ski resort for tadpole badge and almost took a shot as I thought was a regular super mutant.
---
Not sure how that would of ended
---
So many toxic waters in the glass caverns. So many. So little time to get them all.
---
Been getting audio chop today.
---
No disconnects yet
---
I just switched to bloodied because.... Like two or three weeks ago I noticed that when low health all my weapons had higher damage.  I even made a post on here asking why.  Somebody asked if I was using adrenal, and I felt like a 3 year old, because I was mutated with adrenal.  So... I had already had a bloddied 3 star railway stashed away, so I  went bloodied and unyielding.  I think 75% of my weapons in my wheel are bloodied, but it's always nice to not have to spend so many caps on bloodied weapons, if you can just run adrenal and starched genes &amp; class freak.
---
I didn‚Äôt pay much attention yesterday but I did suffer a few disconnects, maybe that‚Äôs what did it. I have a second account and that account has no issue fixing stuff... just odd , like you said , no option to use once the weapon is inspected.
---
I was levelling an alt at the weekend, saw a L6 hounding 2 new L5s so my L10 went in and put his ass down 3x until he stopped seeking revenge .... Always played Pacifist on my main but damn that felt good üòÅ
---
Ok I thought I was sending a lot you have a shopping addiction or really like Xmas lol
---
Ditto. And no cool reward. Waste of plans and time.
---
Well that's good to know. Thanks for the information.

It's really low like 1-10xp I think.

This is either a small spoiler for an upcoming update or it's wrong, I really don't know.

I believe it is a new feature they have added in, I believe if they have killed lots of players, they will have this symbol to indicate they are of bad reputation.

Or maybe they cheated or hacked or did something bad enough for Bethesda to punish them for their actions, and that little icon is indicating that their account has been banned or is undergoing punishment.
---
I don't know for sure but I vaguely remember watching videos on upcoming patch notes and updates and I believe that it was mentioned they were going to be letting people know about players who have a high kill count on dwellers, it might be a glitch that you can't join them, or their account has been banned and this is some new feature they've implemented.
---
It could be anyone of these, I really don't know, but I'll leave an up-vote and continue on my way through the internet.
---
what about the many people have been playing since beta and missed it last year for various reasons? thats not very christmassy to want to horde the christmas deco.
---
Got lucky found a player selling stuck Santa and icicle lights for 200 caps.
---
Also other stuff from gifts cheap.
---
Getting burned out on scorched and xmas scorch spawns and large gift drops have gone to poop
---
Furious will take multiple hits to reach a max of +50% damage which is still less than the constant +80% damage you get from Bloodied when running below 20% health.
---
The true damage numbers for bloodied show when you equip the weapon. I actually just did this experiment with a instigating hunting vs bloodied hunting with stealth rifleman setup for the exact reason of fighting SB. 
---
The instigating first hit would be between 1800-2000 but then drops to a steady 300 where the bloodied would be 1600-1800 every time. 
---
I lose a lil high end damage but gain dps.
---
Happy Cake Day BTW!
---
What is a holiday kill?
---
plentiful more. Ive gotten like 10-15 today.
---
Santa scorched lol
---
nice!
---
What‚Äôs your platform?  (I‚Äôm PS4)
---
To be fair, you can get a small backpack from the Overseer's camp. The problem is that t*hey didnt tell people this*, when backpacks came out. So players think the only way to get one is through the scout badges.
---
?
---
Wow, that's a really cool base. 
---
Haven't played fo76, on the fence of getting it right now.
---
My very first roll ever from Mumbles was 3* V FFR Handmade - never had anything could personally use since, used all my RNG luck up in that one roll...
---
The little nuke symbol next to a name along with (online)  indicates that the player is currently in a NW match.
---
Downvoted twice for because your game didn‚Äôt crash? What has the sub become? Lol
---
Read the plans you pick up to learn them. Scrap guns to learn mods.
---
I don't get it either.  This is a game where you can make a bed out of a few wrenches and some cigarettes.
---
Makes sense. I'll be mindful of this potentiality.
---
That's awesome
---
Yeah I wanted to save some caps in case a player vendor has something good.
---
I knew they must have fixed the drop rate because I hadn‚Äôt gotten anything, then logged on and when i went back to my camp I had three small, a medium, and a large gift all at once.
---
If I have to be afk for a bathroom break or answering the door/phone  I always get into a bed or get on my piano.
---
I call it the Mid Level Blues. 30-45 ish...   
---
Even if you don't plan on using it later, now is the time to suit up in some power armor. Wear that mishmash T-51/T60/T-45 set with the level 25 raider left leg proudly. It will prolong your life, and let you jump down all those annoying cliffs that Rose want's you to jump off of. 
---
Make sure to craft (or have a friend craft) your weapons to max goodness (Hardened receivers, Perforating magazines at a minimum. The .308 hardened received does more damage than the .50 cal on the hunting rifle btw...).  It gets better, I promise. Rose can wait. Go talk to Grafton's mayor again, clean out wavy willards for the 5th time. Have fun. Bring friends. Carry a shotgun even if you aren't perked for it for close encounters. Make friends with a spiked Fire Axe or other high damage melee weapon even if you aren't perked for it. Faster than reloading and dying. Hotkey your aid items. Drink water. Build purifiers at workshops for more water... :)
---
Still haven‚Äôt gotten anything from the dumb robot
---
Keep in mind that many of these perks are only available at levels above 40 (some not even til 50). So it's actually impossible to get max level in all of these til well into the 60s or 70s. But all of them are very good to have... :)
---
Thank you for that.
---
That's the kind of Info I was looking for.
---
Thank you.
---
Damn man! I haven‚Äôt gotten anything I could use personally but definitely some sellable stuff. By now I‚Äôve hit a little over a hundred legendaries! I‚Äôm going to have to turn one of my alts into smile just for scrip!
---
I‚Äôve always been able to play the game despite its many bugs, this is the first time I can say it‚Äôs actually broken.
---
But I was not at the location before trying the first time or are the randomized and there is a chance it already spawned somewhere else? (sorry not on reddit each day so I did not see before) - I would rather not follow a whole walk through and do it myself but thanks for the tip.
---
Thanks, I'm new and I'm really hoping that people like you will help me one day be a well respected Reddit user!
---
Hey. I am a big fan of 3, NV, and 4. I was excited about FO 76 when it was coming out, but I don't really love PvP games so I didn't get it at first. I saw it on black friday sale a few weeks ago when I getting some gifts, so I went ahead and clicked to order it. I have been playing it a few weeks and I am having a ball with it. I am playing it alone. The only bad thing is that sometimes there is a location that is a part of a quest for me, and there is another player in the area that I have to go to for that quest that is like level one gazillion. What happens is the monsters that spawned are leveled up because of that player and it is just impossible. I finally figured it out. At first I was like damn this is a hard quest. It has been a lot of fun scrounging and not having great weapons and not having any caps and just trying to survive. Also, there are some really cool fallout lore stories in there. Overall, I really like it. I would recommend getting it but looking for it on sale (black friday was $10).  The graphics are great and I like the gameplay. It is good to have new challenges and not know what is going to happen. 
---
It is amazing how complex fallout games are.
---
No problem and best of luck!
---
It's got to be less than 25%,as I've never seen a single badge drop from them yet since they came out!
---
Same here.   Got a bloodied walking cane off a corpse and I‚Äôm thinking,‚Äùyou bastards gave me a god roll just so I‚Äôd buy the damn skin‚Äù but alas it was only bloodied and limb damage.  If it was SS I‚Äôd likely have purchased the skin even without a great 3rd Star.
---
The way is good. I go watch now.
---
what places are you going? might be able to give some locations
---
Good call!
---
Yeah I finally got a few items nobody was listing before and I'm finally finding my junkies too stuff too
---
i would imagine so. as long as its operable. Not 100%. been to some bases where the scraptron was in a similar place.
---
We got the wreath last night and it placed in my camp fine. Got the next one (presents I think) just now but haven‚Äôt placed it. Hubs took over the XboxüôÉ
---
They weren't dropping at all before the patch, so it's infinitely more now than before.
---
The Force is Strong with Us. Meet. We Shall. Xx
---
Ok so what days exactly are each available? Really just want 2 know what day the snowflake paint will be available
---
Would be more useful if there were any mods to learn, but it's nice to be able to make the only non legendary Axe in the game.
---
This evening I did a thorough run of 12 spawn locations and ended up with 13 gifts. Some locations had 0 and some had 2-3ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Yeah it‚Äôs so nice! A great reward after I‚Äôve been out looking for those gifts for hoursüòÜ
---
Yesterday was the Wreath, today the presents and so on. I‚Äôve posted them in order in my post.
---
Thanks for this. For anyone else new to the game like me; it's in the Overseer's Cache in the Command Post at the end of the Morgantown Airport dungeon. You get the plans to make a Small Backpack, not the pack itself, but there's a crafting station nearby and the materials are pretty small. Sadly it only adds +5 to your carrying capacity.
---
It‚Äôs a camp decoration (floor decor to be more precise).
---
What console are you on? I‚Äôm going to be playing most of the day tomorrow.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
I only really take on like lvl 60+ people I let the lower lvls have them
---
People are stealing from locked ones. Only truly safe way is four walls and a roof, no door.
---
Oh, ok. Thank you ur very helpfulüéÑüëç
---
No prob, good luck :)
---
It doesn‚Äôt magically make it not a dick move.
---
My personal best spots.
---
High levels:  Glassed cavern, big bend, Berkeley springs, Galleria and sometimes harpers ferry.
---
Low levels: camden park, wavy williards, morgantown airport.
---
I have been playing around 30 minutes and have crashed 3 times already. üòí Usually it might happen like once every few hours if at all. I am relieved to see it's not just me.
---
Alas base built objects are spawned last, so the fast travel mat would not exist yet at the point someone fast travels to your camp, and neither would anything it was placed on, limitations on how the game loads camps!
---
Wall decor
---
You have to sign up but yes it‚Äôs free for amazon prime members. It‚Äôs just a premium version of twitch. 
---
To get the deal log into twitch, select the FO76 deal and follow instructions.
---
Just remembered I have a test tomorrow. so the way after I study for biology.
---
There are a bunch of folks doing this.
---
Welcome to r/fo76. The subreddit where the shills will defend Bethesda to their dying breath while Todd screws and robs them blind.
---
This. I did the same after some idiot picked every lock in my camp during the free week and took all of my water (no biggie) and all of the Santatron's stuff.
---
I moved back to my normal spot and put the santa bot in his own little room.
---
No problem.
---
Wuttttttttt
---
As best i understand, if u have amazon prime, u link it with twitch prime for free. You will get a free sub every month on twitch. BUT how you link twitch prime with bgs, ive no idea
---
On PS4. I've crashed multiple times in a very short time period. It's never been this bad for me. ‚òπÔ∏è
---
Almost got 1st just for the Christmas tent
---
Did you reach the rank of Possum Scout?
---
I felt the same way, but I just did Line in the Sand. Seven scorched (maybe ten percent of the enemies) were all Christmassy. 
---
So, range.
---
Yup, I have the backpack already, and have done a few of those challenges, just I never get badges from that daily!
---
Can I report a crime üòÇ
---
It can‚Äôt be completed and will always be in your pip-boy, even after you get all the holotapes.
---
Was shopping camp vendors.
---
Saw a gift in sanatron but said I wont be that guy.
---
Checked vending machines and the insane pricing.
---
Took the gift out of sanatron
---
That sucks. I get them rather regularly.
---
Ha, is it atomic shop pricing? The authorities are well aware of this theft
---
I have Stranger and love him dearly. It‚Äôs always fun when some newer players have never seen him before and either think he‚Äôs an enemy, another player, or know exactly who he is and lose their minds.
---
Nope. It's not like that. There are no minimums. Zero at Big Bend tunnel means (maybe) eight somewhere else, or only one. Range is like that.
---
Someone stole my holiday gifts üòÇ 
---
From the Santatron
---
HAHA
---
2 things. 1, fast travel mats are available but are workshop only. 2, you can change your base spawn point by selecting the camp unit in the build menu and dragging it. You'll have to play with it.
---
Eh... not a huge deal IMO
---
But it can happen. There's a minimum. Also, in the high level areas (like Big Bend Tunnel) you can get hight level gear for sell. And then buy the wrap from vendors. If you aren't finding enough just change servers. I think old servers are better for this.
---
Are you understanding? The enemies spawn when anyone visit an area. In a public server there are more enemies spawned. There are a lot of areas with scorched, just explore the map and finding them.
---
If you only wanna farm the gifts in a private world, can't you just build a santatron in every workshop? I think the gifts can give you scrip. Again, in this "event" there's a minimum and you are not seeing it because you're limiting yourself to a activity.
---
Lmao, i love the stranger dearly too, Its always heartwarming to see him appear and help
---
You at least received 251 EXP, unlocking first the 1 point challenge and then the 250 point challenge.
---
Last night I did Bolton greens, Morgantown airport outside, and collision course and didn't see one scorched Santa.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt need to requip your armor.... are you really being stripped of all armor after you remove PA??
---
Thing is... They ARE already modded, visually. 
---
Shadowed combat armor is the coolest.
---
Jesus your right.
---
I remember something about damage being scaled for different levels? Not to mention their build might be OP or specific for PVP
---
Is an account link section on the BGS pages
---
Can‚Äôt follow links fro twitch to do so, their linkings are busted
---
I want small, discrete, Silent Running type of robots taking care of my tomatoes.
---
Yeah, its called a Replica Grognak‚Äôs Axe plan. I‚Äôve noticed them in the large gifts, not sure about others.
---
I've never had to re-equip my body armor after exiting PA. Never.
---
I have completed so many possum tasks that have not been counted I lost interest. Every now and again I will try again but to no avail. I have restored power to the power plant more times than I can remember and it‚Äôs never been counted.
---
Love this idea! I have a building at my compound called ‚ÄúR and R‚Äù and it has beds and bathrooms for weary travelers.
---
&gt;I have 4 Plasma grenade plans including one for sale that‚Äôs sitting there for 1500 caps.  No takers yet. 
---
If you're on xbox I'll buy one. Just send me your GT and let me know when you'll be on.
---
The level 50 one is 30.  I believe all the levels are half of what the tadpole backpack is.  So as you level up, you'll get a little better pack.
---
Furious only resets if you don‚Äôt hit it after a certain amount of time or hit a different target.
---
Took me two days of hardcore grinding, probably about 10 hours total. Maybe more.
---
What is karma purple glow?
---
Has anyone been getting a lot of Grognak Axe drops? I've gotten 4 of them in the last week alongside legendary drops. Kind of weird, but I'll take it.
---
Not sure what that means but if you‚Äôre basically a level 80 you should have no issues at any of the places on this post.
---
Never had to do that, have you tried repairing? Or re installing?
---
Damn dude, I need to shop at your vendor! 
---
~~I have no serums, nor any plans to make any, nor any caps at all~~
---
Adapt and improve *ad victoriam*.
---
Could be back next week in a bundle.
---
It's a gamble though.  I want some christmas stuff this week but it will zero out my atoms.
---
But if I don't get them I may miss out,  but they could also be bundled next week.  Or have better stuff.
---
Be nice if they just left stuff on the store but put them on sale a week so you don't miss out just spend more atoms.
---
My armor are shit
---
oh no thats the thing it doesnt go away
---
299, what are you, a 99 cent store? 
---
***LMAO GET REKT***
---
/s
---
Like the liberators but smaller; and maybe green.
---
Not bad, but those melee points should be somewhere else: weight reduction for ammo, or armor, or meds. My commando traded his instigating combat knife for a Fixer modded to fire .38. you can kill everything with it and save your good ammo with no need to get close and personal.
---
Also, consider replacing adrenaline with gun-fu. Gun-fu pays better (you'll be killing things fast without adrenaline anyway, gun-fu takes care of mobs).
---
Sorry, you cannot. It literally stays on your character forever
---
Athlete, entomologist or whatever where you have to take a bunch of pictures,  and swimming.
---
Wtf.
---
Whatever you're wearing, prior to putting on PA, should go back once you exit.  As noted, report this as a bug.
---
Athletic, archery and swimming was easier for me
---
Archer, athlete, swimmer are all pretty easy. I think I also did hunter maybe? Can‚Äôt remember too well, was a dark timeüôÉ
---
Yeah, what?
---
Yepppppppp. Has made my TSE Handmade almost useless. So much for a VATS build. 95% hit chance, no dice says Bethesda.
---
I have this issue with traveling to my camp and either ending up under my camp stuck in the floor or way down the hill (sometimes under the map).
---
The camp location makes no sense at all. I can place the camp kerjigger down and load in and fast travel just fine, then the next day I'm fast traveling and I'm ending up in different places. Same with the other people that travel to me.
---
It clearly doesn't work right. Sometimes when you move it you'll constantly end up on exactly the same spot then move it slightly to the side and suddenly you're no where near your camp!
---
It's insanely frustrating and I know it is for people trying to buy stuff from my vendors.
---
So the tadpole challenges count towards possum badges?
---
I am not saying there's no merit in winning. What I am saying is that most battles are not firefights, but kangaroo jumping vs invisible autoaim vs chems vs autoexplosive rain... 
---
It doesn't feel like an apocalyptic firefight. In fact, I would enjoy being smashed in the dark with a sledge to the kidneys or killed by a rocket launcher in one shot while I sleep. That would mean business!
---
The pipe rifle is fun and cheap to use, but it hasn't bonus for use both perks.
---
I‚Äôve been using them to complete my ‚ÄúKill Scorched with a bladed weapon‚Äù challengeü•∞
---
I got killed at a camp today. He was setting up a camp to kill passive players. I don't know how it killed me, but he could have done it better if he had a fast travel mat in the trap. So I'm kinda thinking no on fast travel mats. ü§î
---
In game and out.
---
Try moving the little camp module. I spawn in difrent places depending on where that is.
---
Do you want your participation trophy as well?
---
I‚Äôd rather see survival servers come back and Adventure have zero PvP. But as long as only one person can use a workshop at a time, that‚Äôs not going to happen. 
---
Don‚Äôt hate the player; hate the game.
---
I‚Äôve been there with 3 tents around and she had no problem landing. She even stood on the fence for part of the battle
---
Anyone know where I find the ‚ÄúWrapped Presents‚Äù I unlocked in NW?!!?
---
Turns out I was wrong.  I thought it was possum badges to unlock backpacks üòÇ 
---
Ive already done it thanks though
---
&gt; and follow instructions.
---
I'm fucked.
---
I would LOVE if the legendary spawn rate stayed this way forever. I haven't played this many hours in months. I haven't gotten a crazy drop,  but I am getting plenty of chances. Loving it.
---
Easiet ones for me was archer athlete and hunter
---
If you're talking about the colored string lights, I think we will be getting some better ones soon. I saw some in a datamine pic.
---
Taxes round down. 
---
300 = 30 cap tax; 270 actually acquired by seller. 
---
299 = 29.9 cap tax, rounded down to 29; 270 actually acquired by seller. 
---
In both, the seller makes the same amount. But in the second, the buyer saves a cap. 
---
Since I don‚Äôt get that extra 1 cap either way, why make the buyer pay?
---
Like a normal grognak, not legendary? If so then yes and shiskabobs. Some of the scorch have bearclaws too until you kill them.
---
I... I was trying to make a joke. I understand the concept of tax rounding. I.. sorry lol.
---
Yea same here! It‚Äôs been a lot of fun running these routes farming legendaries.
---
Screw this update. I ain‚Äôt playing pve or even pvp until this gets fixed
---
Keep an eye out for an event called "Leader of the Pack" It is an easy way to get one star legendaries early on. The event marker appears on the Ferris wheel on the map.
---
When you have your earphones on listen to 10 000 Russo's - UsVsUs or Radio 1
---
They're consecutive, so you got 1 xp and unlocked the 1st, then also got 250, so unlocked the second. You have to unlock each in line begore you can dtart earning towards the next
---
Pics? ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Ok, thanks!
---
I have that character, without the drugs and cannibalism. He is a ninja, because Batman. Invisible and capable of killing everything. However, I suggest an outfit you will love and which goes great with your intentions: the ragstad outfit paired with the hood sack (rare, it doesn't have hoses or anything: it's just a sack with small holes for the eyes).
---
My Batman rocked it during Halloween, really. 
---
Alternative looks: a full set of shadowed combat armor and an assaultron helmet and you become Gray Fox, from Metal Gear Solid. Do you want to be Kung Lao? Pastor Vestments and a Black Prospector hat. Do you have the balls to avoid armor? Nothing looks better than the hooded rags. 
---
Have fun.
---
Damn. I‚Äôm pretty sure I just sold the prime handmade plan for like 100 caps. Lol. Hope they enjoy it!
---
Lots of possibilities. The raiders will probably scavenge the place and we willl  see what they find when Wastelanders comes out. I predict there will be some kind of reward attached to siding with the raiders from the space station itself. I just get a feeling that will happen..
---
Ah. I got that you were being sarcastic but I wasn‚Äôt sure if you understood *why* I priced them that way.
---
Of course I just need a pooping emote to go with it leave no questions unanswered because sharing is caring
---
Well, I noticed you downvoted my comment, so I figured you were mad.
---
That‚Äôs never worked for me. I typically always spawn at the same spot. Maybe I‚Äôm doing something wrong?
---
For a melee build, yeah. Really good if you stack
---
Alien tech. Maybe better alien blaster mods
---
Great when you're running away, or for melee builds? Everyone else, not so much.
---
Just demolish everything and start again. Sorry for your lost, we've all been there.
---
I was fine earlier but tonight I am repeatedly crashing out of the game. Hasn't been a frequent problem up until tonight. Definitely seems like something that happened during the maintenance.
---
I didn't even notice, I always get them confused  üòÇ
---
Do you need a full set?because i have 3 pieces of uny cav armor
---
Oh yeah that‚Äôs what I had to do. Just breaks my heart
---
Me? It need UNY WWR pieces
---
Me? I need UNY WWR
---
Well that is 40 min of study. Time for the war of stars it is.
---
Check the display: if the item is there, don't worry. Visual glitch or something. Sometimes, they load before the display case and fall into hell or something.
---
Just make a basement or attic lock him in there with no door
---
Schplendid.
---
Well i also wanna get some uny sent pieces
---
aw heck! thanks a ton to you and the team :)
---
I was convinced I had to do possum badges but I guess thats for mods

They are down the list a bit, but they are Christmas light shape and in my opinion look better than the ones on sale last week.
---
After i unlocked the wreath and presents it dont show any progress towards next reward?any 1 have this issue?
---
You mind explaining what this is?
---
Unless you have good security cameras or nosey neighbors who saw something, you‚Äôre probably out of luck.
---
It happened to me, took me by surprise and made me incredibly happy, because I can't digest silo runs with their lag and shit. 
---
Underdog and ThrowingKnives, if you are reading this, Keep doing those silos. You are my heroes.
---
Oh, they are also on the foundations, in the picture on the news page when the game starts up. ü§î
---
They're great. Five colours, bobbles. They catch light. Fantastic. I've not tried the four un-decorated ones you get with them, which were only shown in the Atom Shop Preview.
---
I killed a scorched in Christmas drab...got a little wrapped present...what is it? And what do I do w/it?
---
Its a item hackers use to get others banned watch out especially on PC guys name in Bodega he dropped it and it messed my guy up
---
Codebreaker is easy if you have launched a nuke already.
---
Guess it's time to take the law into my on hands then
---
I'm glad it's not just me. Hopefully the account isn't completely messed up. I don't have the time for a new one.
---
Can't spell Satan without Santa ;)
---
They're about somewhere, I know where most of em are since they're usually located close to the workshop bench
---
Agreed. I purposely put it against a different wall for this very reason. I feel the same about the Santa crash plan. Not sure why they miss the mark like this, ever so slightly.
---
Could be. The wastelands might need The Equalizer.
---
Even a 1 star bloodied weapon with adrenal reaction will do more damage than just about any other weapon of its type, so long as you're built for it.
---
I just got a *very* large gift from him. You'll never guess what was inside
---
A Deathcla-**A DEATHCLAW! OH MY GO-**

Oh the whole ammo value bug which can randomly happen when switching weapons.
---
This has actually happened to me swapping from my handmade to my plasma sniper which gave it 35 rounds instead of 15(is it 15? Forgot)...not sure why it happens or what the root trigger is.

drugs are bad, m'kay, so, if you do drugs, you're bad, m'kay, because drugs are bad. they can hurt your body, m'kay, cause drugs are bad, m'kay...

No Idea what you're talking about I regularly miss lunch or don't bring water to work and am easily able to work 8 plus hours any day. Have worked several different types of construction and same goes across all of them
---
I thought those were the ones from last week?
---
I thought just being crouched and being on map also stopped the afk kick timer?
---
...well thats what happens with me anyway
---
A few things for you:
---
\-The game's map is your new best friend. You can see where other players are, the location of player bases, the cost of fast traveling (yes, fast traveling costs caps now,) as well as which workshops are owned by which players. 
---
\- Your special points determine the same stuff as in Fallout 4 (strength determine carry weight and melee power, etc.) *What the game doesnt tell you*, is that your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points aren't permanent. Once you have all your points assigned, you'll be able to move them around once you're a high level. Meaning you'll be able to take a point out of Charisma and put it into Luck if you want. So have fun with building up your character, and don't stress if they're not perfect!
---
\-The game's vendors have recently been streamlined. Every vendor now has a shared daily limit of 1400 caps- this means that a vendor on one side of the map will have the same amount of caps as a vendor on the opposite side of the map. This limit isn't great, but it resets daily. There is also a limit to the amount of caps you can have- I believe it's 30,000 caps at the moment. 
---
\-To compensate for the vendors, player economy is now a thing. You'll be able to build up to 4 vendors in your c.a.m.p., and sell almost anything you'd like- from ammo to food. You'll also be able to see other player's vendors on the map, as well as the types of wares they have for sale.  When you buy from a player's base, the caps go directly to that player- and when a player buys from your camp, the caps go to you! 
---
\-The atom shop is a fun cosmetic store in the game, where you can spend "atoms" on items. You can purchase atoms for real money, or earn them by completing challenges in the game. The shop also offers free items almost weekly, so check it often!

\- On the subject of other players: There are high level players that will attack you, for no reason. **Do not** **attack back**\- that will count as initiating combat. They will kill you, which will give them your caps. Ignore the players that do this, at all costs. Turning on Pacifist mode in your settings is a great way to avoid this scenario altogether These players are not a major problem, most other vault dwellers you'll find are good people, or at the very least, indifferent. But I've heard enough stories from new players to warrant adding that advice in.
---
I apologize for the long read, but that's just a handful of stuff I'd have *killed* to know before day 1.
---
How did you get the Fixers to drop? Thought they only came from trading with the vendor
---
not only am i *positive* they nerfed the xmas scorched spawn rates, but in my experience the hordes spawned at fissure sites have gotten RIDIC. last night i fast-traveled to one and had 3 legendary scorchbeasts, a horde of high-level, non-xmas scorched, a high-level feral ghoul horde, and a cave cricket horde all spawn at the same time. in the meadow i ran to while fighting them off was a bullet-sponge legendary sheepsquatch who ate my lunch. 
---
ps wouldn‚Äôt at least some of these fight each other? what makes *me* so tasty?
---
1 reward is unlocked every day at 7PM EST. Yesterday was the Wreath, Tonight was the Presents, tomorrow will be the tree...and so on until all are unlocked.
---
I‚Äôll hate the player. Not sorry if it hurts his wittew feewings.
---
I don't really understand the attraction to cavalier armor  It only works while sprinting right?  So not while fighting?  I would certainly use it over some things, but not put a lot of effort into acquiring.  Am I missing something about it.  Sentinel, I get the attraction.
---
Played for about 5 hours today on Xbox One X, but didn‚Äôt suffer any inordinate amounts of lag (just the usual open-the-map-laaaag) nor any crashes. Though some audio in Nuclear Winter seemed muffled at times‚Äîa power armor player stomped right by me but his big old feet hardly made a peep. I guess he was wearing moccasins.
---
He is living in the South Pole now.  Only gets the dwarves on weekends.
---
Yeah
---
Whose feelings are hurt?  Your inability to be logical isn‚Äôt upsetting anyone. 
---
Don‚Äôt flag yourself for PvP and you never have to deal with it.  It‚Äôs that simple.
---
I just did Big Bend mine and got 5-6 combining outside and inside. &lt;shrug&gt;
---
I, Girono Giovona have a dream
---
I don‚Äôt downvote comments.  It‚Äôs a waste of time.
---
Is his name BodegaTheKid or something like that?
---
Same, when I open up the terminal there is no selection option. Do I need to hook up ANOTHER terminal from the camp build menu to the Santa trot station to switch it?
---
Agreed. Also, I would've much rather had a real fire
---
The ones last week were from last year, and were round lights like most of the string lights. I'm guessing the new ones will be next week. But I might be wrong. Hopefully they won't coat too much tho. üò∞
---
wtf do these pies actually do apart from help with being 15% less hungary?
---
Thank you very much for the reply
---
If you don't have collectron then it is stuck at default gift collecting I think.
---
Purple is the 7th number of the alphabet
---
My play through today went well, no crashes
---
He‚Äôs just fucking with ya man, it won‚Äôt get you banned. Lol now I know where you got that idea from though. [link to pic which I‚Äôm talking about](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/600638506640998412/657054714114080798/image0.png)
---
I want my little Commie-Bots roaming around...
---
Bingo
---
Wait I think he meant he changed it back to a scrap collectron now that I‚Äôm looking at it
---
bump
---
Oh no, I'm allergic to death claws...
---
Dude it's crazy easy. I signed up for free trial with Amazon, linked to get twitch prime and then linked to BGS to get the free stuff within like 5min.
---
Smart guy, this entire thing is just to nuke the overflow of caps on 4 alts everyone has lol. Pretty smart for Bethesda, it resets the economy a little.
---
It won't get you banned, thats just a fake hoax a youtuber made up to get views.
---
I‚Äôve done the entire Big Bend many times and I think the most I got was 3. Not lucky for me I guess haha
---
I feel ya...  I also wish the release dates of so many of the datamined goodies were more detailed, as it would increase interest if we knew when something new was going to be premiered.
---
See now that‚Äôs just not true, you won‚Äôt get banned for being pink. No need to drag names through the dirt calling people hacker when you know that ain‚Äôt true.
---
Off topic question, but how do you get the faction next to profile name. I'm pretty brand new to reddit so not sure of the ends and outs on here
---
I think if they add this feature after or during Wastelanders that would be awesome. But right now we are on an infinite time loop and winter wouldnt match Oct. But since were jumping ahead in time in Wastelanders, it would make sense. Especially if they keep time rolling.
---
Been an issue since launch. I can't switch characters and place my tent in the same (now empty) spot because it still thinks it is another build area. Pain in the ass.
---
FO76 is unfortunately a scam based model: Here is their hero and business model [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNjI03CGkb4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNjI03CGkb4)
---
He‚Äôs referring to an aid item called Vox_interpreter_dart which applies the effect used by the vox syringer item from a daily quest. The effect usually makes a character purple for a short time, but when applied directly by the aid item it will last seemingly indefinitely. (It wears off eventually and can also be removed if you know how)
---
Ah, wasn't complaining, just wondering as I only noticed them last night and thought they arrived with the current update
---
I‚Äôm not 100% familiar with Reddit, but look for User Flair. That is what shows up next to your name. There should be an option to create or edit your User Flair.
---
Ok this gives me hope because I was workshopping for hours for the past few days just customizing my terribly designed camp, and never found ANY gifts, or scrap and the terminal wouldn't let me select an option, so I'm hoping I can play a bit tonight before my crazy dog finishes off my ethernet cable and Comcast comes to repair it. ugh.
---
Thx
---
If it didn't make the money, it wouldn't be done like it is. I don't think the game is yet in a state worthy of getting more money than I already paid on launch out of me, so the best I can do is hold on to atoms until something amazing comes around. All you can really do with this system tbh
---
Go to the chest at the end of Morgantown Airport and grab the small backpack from there. It doesn‚Äôt have as much storage but it takes 5 minutes and you can put a skin on it.
---
Yeah, it was disappointing that they didn't give him an alt line for when you become a possum. I'm sure one day I'll be 3 ranks above possum and he'll still be saying I'm a tadpole.
---
Definitely. Anytime I'd start hearing crickets, I'd pull up the Pip-Boy and check the time, turn to my friend and say "Time for Campfire Tales"!!! I liked it that way a lot more because it just felt realistic and natural.
---
Nocturnal explosive gatling plasma
---
Two shot the dragon (level 35 RIP)
---
Junkie's explosive weightless assault rifle
---
Quad fire rate reload speed handmade
---
Quad tesla rifle
---
honorable mention to a bloodied swing speed walking cane, considered keeping it around for a bloodborne cosplay or something but I'm not a melee character and don't like bloodied so off to the trash it went
---
I play early in the morning when there are around 30 people online in the match. I loved a large map because I can go off to my normal spot and it's empty. I can look for nuke briefcases and nuke cards without running into enemies.
---
Great job!!!   
---
I've been running Pictapa....idk wtf that word is, the magazine finder perk for the last couple months now and I'm 1 Unstoppables away still. If you'd've told me earlier this year that I would get the plasma grenade plan BEFORE I found that last magazine (have literally been missing it since scouts was added), I'd've said you were crazy....but here we are.  
---
Imo this Christmas event has been the best event they've ran because it's constant, easily accessible, and filled to the brim with unbelievable rewards.
---
I thought the same thing until tonight when I switched to my alt and got 5 in the tunnel.  I had done this 3 times without a single spawn in my other character.
---
Sentinel only works while standing... Not crouched or jumping. Dead still... Taking fire.
---
Don't listen to people it's near worthless. Cavs lets you dip when you need too.
---
Played a lot of survival and sentinel is extremely overrated in pvp and imo just stupid to stand and take damage in pve.
---
One exception is Queen fights for bloodied melee monsters. Interestingly a melee build is best suited for it.
---
Ron and Tim.
---
But it also made Power Armor just a pure upgrade to regular armor.
---
I don‚Äôt think a SBQ gives a fuck about a couple of tents
---
You could try filthy casuals and maybe find a group of people who can help you out! I would but I‚Äôm on Xbox.
---
I absolutely agree. This has been an awesome event thus far. 
---
For all the criticism that Beth gets (some deserving &amp; some not) they really hit it out of the park IMO.
---
I will admit that I smile every time I get the "Mounted Beaver" plan from this event. That sounds like something out of the Kama Sutra.
---
I bet Butcher Pete knows all about the mounted Beaver with his hackin' and whackin' and smackin'.
---
What level are you?
---
The game is pretty tough starting out and can be quite difficult till level 35 or 40.
---
Somedays you may need to get on and just gather materials in areas you know you can survive. 
---
Weapons perks are pretty well defined, make sure you start developing those as early as possible with your choice of primary.
---
This. I‚Äôve been waiting in that damned Nuka Cola fridge what feels like forever.
---
Alright that was pretty damn funny! I actually laughed out loud.
---
ive never got less than 3 at big bend and its the only location i run through.
---
Thanks, I'll give that a whirl!
---
Just played for an hour and had three gifts in the bin, one from scorched in Helvetia, and three from gift wrap at the tinker bench. Thanks again for the heads-up üëç
---
I do the same but I rarely unequip my refrigerated backpack. Took the carnivore mutation and never looked back. I have food in there that I‚Äôve had for months. They really could nerf the refrigerator mod and I wouldn‚Äôt be mad.
---
No, it's been patched out.
---
The real 10 star was with us the whole time.
---
&gt; BUT how you link twitch prime with bgs
---
Someone gave a solution already, here's another:
---
Log into twitch, click on the crown in the top-right, then click on Learn More for the FO76 rewards. The page it takes you to will guide you through connecting your accounts.
---
of course of course! may the holidays in rl be merry! and your bounty of gifts in 76 be plentiful!
---
since when?
---
Indeed, cheers!
---
Just 3
---
Like 3 patches ago. Only the meat hook is left for dual perks
---
I started playing an alt who is only 34, just by randomly going places I find bags of legendaries everywhere.  No idea who leaves them but did get a nice explosive black powder pistol.
---
Like 12
---
No, but I would like a deathclaw.
---
If only finding and keeping pets were easier.
---
Lol dwarves.
---
Well that was a lot of plot twists.
---
Dang that sucks. I just traded a TSE Double Barrel for a 3 Star Explosive Mutant Slayer reduced weight BA Pipe rifle..was hoping to get the double perks still. I guess it's still a viable gun tho.. Better than that TSE fur sure
---
Leadgendary.
---
Oh wow that looks really bad. Why would they do that?
---
Stick around the forest or toxic valley for a few more levels, events at a great way to level up quickly.
---
People were saying it was only possible to unlock one reward on any given day. Was that misinformation?
---
that's such a superficial take on the situation. what about the early '00s Korean MMO odds of rolling decent legendaries? why nobody ever bring those up?
---
if it wasn't for duppers you'd rarely see good legendaries, let alone godly ones. that's why whenever someone rolls something that hasn't been duped, they're flooded with X:1 offers plus several hundred thousand caps.
---
You heal when you take radiation damage. The wording is a bit confusing, I first though it was you heal when you already have radiation damage but no, you heal when you actually take radiation damage. Jump into some toxic water in the toxic valley to see this in action.
---
Stay in the forest, maybe head south towards Charleston and focus on Scorched. Then use/sell/break down their weapons. Oh, and use good melee weapons as much as you can reasonably- so much easier to stay stocked on ammo when you scrounge a lot and only shoot a little
---
If you can get a hold of, or download. Tales of Janna's Palace. Very good short stories. Xx
---
It Just Works ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
---
I took a screenshot of where you do it but forgot you cant reply with pictures.
---
When your on the main FO76 page there should be 3 dots in the top right corner(phone user) click on change user flair and select a faction.
---
I had a similar experience with my 10mm submachine gun, except it was that its durability didn't go down the entire time I was playing. Nice when a bug works in our favor!
---
Much appreciated!
---
Mole mom is best mom.
---
Very well written.
---
Sounds like the games not for you if you did immediately resort to looking for exploits.
---
Doubt this is a legit lost though.
---
I'll add you on xbox too 
---
I'm a little interested in the law enforcement idea
---
Open it up. It‚Äôs in the aid tab and will give you items.
---
It's funny because they only took out the 5 stars. All the other hacked stuff is still in the game. Prepare to see an influx of 3 stars, plans, and desirable outfits (IE sun mask)
---
Sun mask was already circulating though, but not too worried as I'm not on PC, sucks that you guys have to deal with cheaters like that though my guy
---
As a connoisseur of this delectable enhancer many a time my health can go to exactly zero or even negative and my body still stands. When you emit more radiation than a cracked open fusion generator you walk a strange line.
---
Explain the 1.4k caps thing, what do I do for that?
---
Nope my character is lagacy free bud nive try tho.
---
Well any where you find scorched normally you can find the holiday scorch guys. Camden park, fissure sights, etc. but legendary scorch beasts can be at any fissure sites but I seem to find them most in the bog.
---
Shit I just fucked up the post! It was on 69 and I upped it to 70 realised what I'd done and downed it, but it went down to 68! Now 69 is in limbo and prison.
---
It‚Äôs down to 65!!! What have you done!!???
---
Considering almost all my challenges are only 10 Atoms and card packs, that does little to help in any way. Especially considering items only stick around for a week before being vaulted.
---
NOOOOO!!! O God someone tell me how to fix this? '?'
---
If you want, I can get you the antidote to get rid of the glow. I can also help you take care of him. Let me know
---
Yeaah Ive had this twice now.
---
Ended up jumping on my private server üòÇ
---
check out many a true nerds recent video explaining all of the atom shop and how it ended up as it is today  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaoFH-S2FXE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaoFH-S2FXE)
---
Bug: Friction for all objects in the world objects set to 0. Junk now alternates between sliding away from you so you can't pick it up, and accelerating to the speed of light and killing you.
---
Lol upvote it! Upvote it up vote it!!!!! Before it plummets into the ground! 70 is better than 7!!!
---
They have been planning to do a massive rebalance of weapons with wastelanders so its doubtful we will see anything before then.
---
They can have my fertilizer.
---
um itts not just me tho cuz as soon as i get in game i cee and npc  name preston garvey and i kno that he ist from falout for... soooooo lik i think its like bad hackers do bad thing to game
---
Mines beside that classic window, well now its on my roof
---
Fair call, but most people keep the brick to the outside. Still seems like an odd choice when the color and texture were already there.
---
y r u shouting at me üòü i am soft üßà
---
Maybe you should have just made an appropriate gamer tag? Lol. I used to be Ovarybuster69 but I grew up and changed mine. Just food for thought, it‚Äôs not Bethesda‚Äôs fault you made a shitty gamer tag lol
---
Yup xd
---
Went through AVR Medical, Tyler, Clancy Manor,  Wixon Farm, Glassed Cavern &amp; not one Santa or Jack Frost, something has definitely changed
---
Did- did you talk to him?
---
I honestly don't think Eurogamer's article was a good thing. The thought never once crossed my mind about RWT in this game and had it not been for that article, I would never have been interested enough to check out a couple websites that sell these items. I'm pretty sure I'm not alone in this either and this is going to generate more purchases for these people because of it. (I'm not gonna buy anything but I'm sure there are players that will.)
---
Only a few items can be obtained from large boxes that aren't in the others. Save some caps and get smalls üëç
---
Offer is still up.  I'll probably play a few hours in the morning.
---
You sound like my dad!
---
How did you get your health meter to show a numerical value?
---
your argumentation level is too much for me.
---
It‚Äôs a camp decoration
---
Thanks for this tip I had no idea! Also since you pointed this out i have noticed looting a large quantity or all of the ultracite around marked an unmarked fissure (most noticeable on unmarked actives)seems to have a chance to spawn a scorchbeast.
---
Yeah. I've settled for: It's close enough. But I really love the look of the brick wall red.
---
The second set is in response to sheepsquatch but I also heard another about being on the way to the airport the other day at a random spawn
---
&gt; I bet Butcher Pete knows all about the mounted Beaver with his hackin' and whackin' and smackin'.
---
Pete don't care whose meat he chop.
---
Check edit if you can found out more about getting gifts
---
Ok yeah thanks, I‚Äôve gone to a couple scorched spawns now but yet to see one of the holiday ones, guess I‚Äôm just being impatient üòù
---
Did your heart grow three sizes?
---
I did that as well. Ever since this update the game is just constantly crashing to the point of being unplayable. I even uninstalled it, restarted my router, power cycled the console, updated the PS4 software, I have done every trouble shooting suggestion. My internet connection is fine, the ping is fine, I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs wrong it‚Äôs very frustrating.
---
Yeah, locking them would make YOU the scrooge lol. Not that mine isn't locked already.
---
Lol
---
This man big brains!!! Well that's a game changer......BRB on the 31st.
---
I start at Camden park, clear that out, then bounce to my tent set up in front of the big bend tunnel. I go clear out big bend then go through the NAR repair yard, across the 2 fissure sites, then into the glass cavern. Remember every time you pull ultracite ore it spawns a couple scorched. So when your at the fissure, R.I.P. those and see what you get. And also there is a ton in the glass caverns. I usually find 1-5 at least on that route. Good luck!
---
Joke‚Äôs on all of you, it‚Äôs Krampus. 
---
You‚Äôve been naughty.
---
The weight reduction perks only apply to items you are carrying, not what's in your stash. You can't break down ammo or duplicate plans, and you can only sell them to other players,  drop them, or give them away.
---
Drop then into one of the corpses new players run across when they first exit the vault for the first time.
---
I think the Santatron is set to presents by default (it's a little hard to tell because when it's selected it looks like programming code). The reason I say this is because when I placed mine down the only options I saw was scrap and junk. So I chose scrap and backed out of the terminal. Went right back in and the 2 options were junk and presents. Then I chose presents. So it looks like it shows you the 2 options that aren't active, hence why I think presents was active by default, but I couldn't tell until choosing different options.
---
I think I'm just gonna take the bounty and start lock picking these santatrons when I see presents.
---
Would be awesome
---
Yaay
---
LOL I legit thought you where trolling me like some of the other replies, I mean really go to the dmv to get a replacement ID? I never expected to come across that in a video game. Thanks for you help, got it done!!
---
Haha
---
Imo this is definitely the best event we've had because it's easily accessible, always available and the rewards are just insanely good (I like collecting plans).
---
You went off a bit there in the middle but I agree with you. More in game content, more experience based rewards. New rare items in game that has a probability high enough to know they exist.
---
In Morgantown at the tattoo parlor where Biv is, there‚Äôs always an Addictol behind the desk in the tattoo room
---
You may have to set him to collect Christmas gifts via the terminal.
---
Played 3/2/1?
---
They dropped from the berkley mama, I wanted to count that in
---
Please, we beg you, don't posit mor.
---
Same for me. And the whole server crashes because my friends get DC'd too.
---
No but 3 more bottles of booze and some junk so just a normal Christmas.
---
Good God shut up.
---
Christ, I‚Äôm about to have a seizure reading that. Lay off the meth.
---
82 now!
---
It‚Äôs saved!!! You did it!! May your dead scorched have large boxes.
---
Junk
---
I choose camps based on what they have. If there at there camp and over lvl 50 with weapons and armor ill go... If they got weapons and armor ill go. If they got weapons and armor and over 30 plans ill go. If they got weapons and armor and over 1000 ammo ill go. If they have every slot filled I DO NOT go, biggest turn off. Location doesnt matter. I check the whole map when im looking to spend. 
---
Even at my camp if I dont have 30 plans or 1000 ammo to sell on a character I dont put any at all. Keep weapons and armor at the least.
---
Doesnt always mean I wont show up to your camp if you items like that but I do what my gut tells me. I even tell my buddy who doesnt always play, ‚Äúdont go to that camp it will be a waste of time‚Äù and when he does he finds out I was right.
---
He‚Äôs spreading falso info
---
Not true
---
I've used explosive and vats crit damage with my sneak rifleman/commando and I would definitely rather have crit damage. I one hit most enemies without explosive damage, and the enemies seem to find me faster with explosive bullets. I like to save crits for tough enemies anyways.
---
Not only that but the ‚Äúlimited time‚Äù items that seem to come back like every other week
---
A hah.
---
Dude I‚Äôm on PS4 and can barely play the game without it crashing after 10-20 minutes. Whatever they did.....they did it. This is personally the worst state I‚Äôve ever seen the game in. I defended it too like yourself, but I feel like I can‚Äôt put up with this anymore. People would say the game is broken but it was just buggy, now the game is actually broken. They expect people to pay a monthly subscription for such an unreliable product?
---
any luck on your end yet?
---
True im on the bone i just couldnt get a game. Ill try again but looks like a good time
---
Twitch prime is amazon prime. If it isnt, then paying 5-12 bucks a month to twitch is a rip off. If you get amazon prime, you get A twitch prime sub.
---
Ok
---
Every time I see a low-level person I don't have everything I don't need on them and I'm still way overweight
---
I drop that stuff at train stations when I'm in low level areas for new players. The plans and ammo have no value beyond what another will pay for it. Most plans dont have a high value anyway and ammo is abundant and easy to craft with super duper perk. 
---
As for your stash, check for gunpowder. I had it, every new player I meet has it. It adds up and you dont need to stash it. Check your aid tab too. Aid is heavy in this game. I dont have any aid in my stash save for some serums and alcohol. I carry it all on me with traveling pharmacy park.
---
The first present my Santatron gifted me with had the plasma grenade plans. I almost cried.
---
Might have to do with the same fast travel bug when you attempt to go to another location 15 times in a row.
---
Since the update people are short in caps compared to before. Maybe the high rollers are buying wrapping paper? Either way I‚Äôve seen a drop in business myself. Certain locations fair better than others however if you have a good selection of items across the menu you will have decent traffic no matter where you are on the map
---
Thank you, and may your 3 star legendaries drop 3 star weapons!
---
You want my lazar wifle?
---
I think everyone who bought fo1st should get a reimburstment or something
---
I was talking about this with a mate the other day lmao mostly just to harrass people and plant evidence on them though, i hoarded a bunch a uniforms
---
Move two points from strength to endurance, spec into max level Ironclad card and keep Lvl 3 Traveling Pharmacy in Strength.
---
I mean you can use bloodied weapons with just a bloody mess buff if that, and still do decent dmg compared to anything else. Bloodied does like 80%+ in general, compared to anything else.
---
... "right off the Bat" huh?  Very punny.
---
You have to loot a certain number of objects before the items will respawn.
---
I assume some of the first references are recycled from Fallout 4 and refer to Power Armor. Super Mutants in 76 also refer to "Bucket Heads" a lot, which is a reference to humans in power armor.
---
Some of the other references seem to refer to robots though.
---
It's shit like this that makes it so hard to keep supporting a game I want to love. Why can't they just be honest with us? They know it didn't work, and we know it didn't work. There was no "increase" and pretending we all just had bad RNG makes it seem they won't ever be honest with us. This is no way to build trust. People tire quickly of being lied to. I hope they can stop pretending and just be honest with us. We'd be much more likely to support their efforts if they would. 
---
When are companies going to learn that honesty builds more brand loyalty than hiding behind excuses?
---
Wall decor?
---
2 disconnects in an hour, quitting time for the night- is this pre release still?
---
The change sucked due to the fact we couldn‚Äôt go to our normal spots like we usually do. In conclusion, smaller circle didn‚Äôt give me nor my team mates much options.
---
Looks like someone has developed an Addictol addiction!
---
But jesabebus wold you liek look at thas post I‚Äôm havign a hedache.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs where mine is. Have you tried completely restarting the game?
---
Why is it ‚Äúenormously unfortunate‚Äù
---
Gun fu is necessary for my stealth commando
---
Also would replace all of your melee perks with other stuff. I personally run 2 bandolier, 3 traveling pharma, and 2 sturdy frame. The sturdy frame helps with sneaking since it makes your armour lighter. Bandolier 2 makes certain ammo weigh 0. Traveling pharma 3 is necessary since I always find so many chems, dilute them, then sell em.
---
Would also drip ninja since you are a gun build. I always have 4 endurance for radicool and level 3 fireproof. Gives me plus 5 str and makes me take 0 damage from sonic attacks or exploding cars. 
---
Would also swap
---
The game isn't telling you, but it thinks there's any enemy nearby. Move slightly (about 30 feet), crouch, and try again.
---
You have to do the 3 tadpole challenges to unlock the Possum challenges - like; you complete them to get the promotion from Tadpole to Possum
---
You absolutely did
---
I spawn close to hornwright air purifier site 3(?) and I LEGIT ALWAYS spawn in the pond next to it, especially annoying when I have power armor on...
---
The fact weight reduction doesn't work on the stash is... obnoxious as is the ammo thing. I'm actually having ammo issues because of dealing with so many major bullet sponges (Thank you scorch beast, for taking over 2000 bullets...). I went from stealth/sneak attack to heavy guns because for some reason rifles doesn't get the reduction perks big guns do and the .50 and minigun I have seems to have reliable damage just they go through ammo at an alarming rate. 
---
I did take the pharma perk so I could carry all my aid around on me already, have banderboiler and bear arms as well now. I should take the energy ammo one as well for fusion cores as I just saw they were around 3 pounds and used F1st to farm 20 of them from the powerplant workshop in a private server.
---
Disappointing you can't scrap plans into something like scrip for random new ones. I thought containers respawned enough that leaving random gifts for new players would just vanish before any one got a chance to get to them.
---
Lock the box. Same way you can add locks to doors
---
I'm just bummed it can't go on my front door
---
I love the fact when foodbuilds tell me that I should have asked if they don‚Äôt need the workshop anymore and if it‚Äôs okay to take it over like ???????
---
I guess you mean a lot
---
Are you sure you‚Äôre not thinking of the ‚Äúsigns and letters‚Äù plan? That normally goes for 5 to 10k 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure small letters is fairly common.
---
Weird flex but okay.
---
You can obtain the plan by claiming a workshop.
---
It would be nice if they would also add the ability to see the name of the item on display. Like weapons and clothes
---
That was my immediate reaction too
---
Yeah, agreed, it's just RNG.
---
I did a quick run through Morgantown Airport last night (and the cargo drop event there), got 2 holiday scorched around the airport, and then 1 each wave of the cargo drop event except the last wave.
---
Oh, no. I‚Äôm talking about the small letters, I usually see the small letters at least 1000c, for me that‚Äôs pretty pricey.
---
Bloodied and adrenal both stack. Yes technically you have a slightly higher max hit with instigating vs bloodied with the same build and if you stay at 5% hp. Bloodied weapons cap at 90% damage boost I think. Instigating is 100% if the enemy is at full health. If your instigating doesnt kill it on the first hit, you essentially are using a normal non legendary for every hit until it dies. Bloodied keeps the high damage no matter what the targets health is.
---
Also, if you are in a situation that you can one hit the enemy with instigating, chances are you could one hit with bloodied as well at low hp, so it's best to just use bloodied
---
I just buy rubber whenever I see it in player vendors and the rest I never run out of. My characters are always holding 20+ helmets waiting to be turned in.
---
Use a courier next time
---
I had the same issue too where my frames would drop and it had to do with some programs running, for instance, Razer Game Manager was slowing my games down until I discovered the source of the issue and closed them. Try and see what‚Äôs running in your task manager. Also I like to do a Scan and Repair after every update as they tend to make my game crash more frequently.
---
This is a regular occurrence, I have been playing since launch, and it will crash hard at least once an hour, in some cases more often. I am on the Xbox platform as well. 
---
I also noticed the game will freeze just as frequently. 
---
It all apart of the fallout 76 experience. Nothing will ever change. Personally I don't think this game was designed for Xbox, its more stable, and better all around on PC. Go figure. 
---
Nonetheless I wish you, and  everyone the best!
---
But seriously I can‚Äôt tell if this is a ‚Äújoke‚Äù post or was written from a as I can assume ‚Äúmature adolescent‚Äù
---
Oh damn, Lol. I‚Äôm still pretty noob at this game so forgive me.
---
You might have misread. Only 1 reward is released per day. If you start on Day 1, you can only earn Day 1 rewards. If you start on Day 2 instead, you could earn the reward for Day 1 first, followed by Day 2's reward. Any XP you earn is applied to the first reward. Excess XP then goes to the next reward. If the subsequent reward is not yet available, excess XP is unused.
---
But still, 25c is chump change. You can always earn them back!
---
Warframe does vault things and unvault things occasionally but they only do it with things you have to grind for
---
naw its too easy to make money selling hacked weapons in this game or accounts that got leveled up.
---
‚ÄúMigraine intensifies‚Äù
---
Nice rug, really ties the room together.
---
Two shot slaps you with a 50% miss chance regardless of the vats chance.
---
Its bad news for vats
---
Sometimes it shows up empty unless you put something in the container, it's happened to me before and I got everything back.
---
Source? I dont recall hearing them say anything relevant to balance.
---
I started out with a mutant's/faster fire handmade as my first decent gun.  Given that I started farming in earnest with it nine months ago and now have a b/e lever gun and fixer as my primary sniping weapons, I'd say you just got your first skeleton key to Appalachia.  Cheers to many more victories in the future.  
---
Heart and persistence are always going to be the best weapons in your arsenal.  We've all gone through bad spells of crap loot drops, the long timers and legendary farmers, but persistence always comes through.  You only have to roll that [dream gun once](https://imgur.com/b6rT95A) or [twice](https://imgur.com/tg2pP48).  It's yours to keep.
---
Just to prove that lightning strikes regularly if you're willing to keep flying the kite.  Within the past 3-4 months.

It‚Äôs also happened to me a couple of times. In fact that was the first new thing I noticed in the update. Cool new bug, thanks guys.
---
I'm normally off Monday and Tuesday, and up to raid. I haven't completed it yet myself. My partner hated it, so we don't run.
---
I look at weapon count versus armor count, but if there's more than say, 60 misc, I'll always check it out. Beyond that, if I'm genuinely curious about a player's potential draw, I find and check their level on the map, taking into account where they are.
---
I got that plan first day, and flipped it for 5k, the price will diminish during saturation, but increase over time.
---
I hate it when that happens. Can't go anywhere sometimes.
---
thanks!
---
I have no idea .. I went back to camp .. I had no chance and had got what I needed .. caps back then we're sparse and I had nothing else to give .. I just didn't get why ..  but I don't get it why a level 4, or something like, that is punching me in my camp with the level 180- ish sitting afk right outside the door, and after I went to my stash box so they knew I dumped my junk .. it just seems weird to me why that is fun .. idk, maybe I am the weird one .. it is fun for me if it is a challenge, otherwise why possibly make someone hate the game or community or struggle while leveling up for junk which is everywhere .. I guess I just don't get it, I'd rather help them build, I will go after them when they are hooked on being a wastelander, have leveled up, and got a chance to win if they fight well üôÇ way down deep I gotta soft spot for everyone who holds true to this game. Sometimes it is not so easy.
---
Just tried it did not work it is lost forever ten's of thousands caps and hour's of farming down the drain

Getting them stolen by him is special

Are you on XB1? if so, I'd be happy to invite you to my game and show you my camp!
---
Had about 9 at a queen. We all destroyed her easily enough. Was a odd fight but a fun experience. Tents didn't bother her on xbox.
---
How did you complete the chemist challenge for shooting creatures with the syringer?  Remember trying it months ago and it not working.  Was it bugged and fixed, or need to do something special?
---
True that
---
Yes, good ol' friendly teabagging really seems to get their attention and get them excited for what awaits them... I should probably start including relevant notes in the gifts though.
---
Why the hell would you trust that method in the first place?

Cool! Thanks for info :)

He‚Äôs a outlaw loose and running came a whisper from his lips he‚Äôs here to do some business with a big iron on his hip.....BIG IRON HIS HIPPPPPSSS.
---
The bathrobe definitely counts as sleepware since I used it for the challenges
---
Holy cow. How many hours do you have in game?
---
Yea I actually paid for it to support the game in hopes that they would continue to work on it and ultimately improve it but I tried again tonight twice and it crashed within 10 minutes. I restarted in safe mode, rebuilt database, power cycled console, deleted game data on the console, restarted my router, and reinstalled the game, and if anything it seems worse today than yesterday. I‚Äôve thought about trying to get a refund and encouraging anyone else who can‚Äôt play the game and has paid for fallout 1st to do so as well. They‚Äôll only learn if we hit them in their wallets.
---
I have a pipe weapon build and it double dips into rifleman/pistol perk cards.
---
Put them in a suitcase in a train station so anyone can take them. I think they may stay in the suitcase after you log off? At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing
---
For me the game has been more stable than ever the last 2 weeks. Not one disconnect!  (XBOX 1X)
---
That would only apply to the almost non-existent PC NW community. While PC can barely support a a few dozen players during the day, there are hundreds of console NW players online most of the day. If this change was made to appease the smallest group of NW players, but it upset much larger groups of NW players, doesn't it make sense to keep the vibrant, active console community happy? PC is essentially a lost cause until the cheaters are gone. Should Bethesda alienate the console community as well?
---
Gotta be honest, I haven't used it before. But I use sun kissed which is worded the same (except it's the rad version) and that one works in and out of combat. So I'd assume that photosynthetic would also work in and out of combat.
---
Also a little tip, the salvaged assaultron head deals radiation damage to the user, so it can heal you up if used with ghoulish.
---
Pretty sure someone said something similar but not as expansive as this. But there is one valid concern about this, and that would be having to retexture large parts of the maps with snow, potentially bringing new bugs, server issues, etc. I like the idea I just don‚Äôt think they would do it anytime soon.
---
It‚Äôs interesting how we all have different experiences. For me the game has been very stable the last 2 or 3 weeks on Xbox 1X. I haven‚Äôt disconnected at all. But before the last patch disconnected once every 3 or 4 hrs.
---
Thanks for this comment lol as someone who plays all aspects of the game. People get mad for no reason. And crying about workshops being taken is old as we all know.
---
Wait... what? Backpacks are real? I thought they were just an inside joke for redditor vault dwellers!
---
No it isnt Bethesdas fault, lol, but they let us make a character tag. I just wanna be able to use it. I like my game tag for other games that I do a lot of killing on, this is the only game where tag  isnt relevant to game online play. I cant be a vendor with a name (similar) to "watchoutoryourdead" but I'll be danged if I dont instigate it in other games. This is the only game I am non violent in, my character name is kind and thoughtful. I want folks to come shop at my camp based on my name. I avoid "_killrxman_" camp even though he may have the best deals in town.
---
This last update and patch did a lot of damage to the game, who the hell even knows
---
I‚Äôve noticed the same thing. My thirst level is draining at least 25% faster since the last patch.
---
Don't accept a random game or team invite from strangers. 
---
While loading into a server, players camps are vulnerable. For team invites they can drag you into pvp and steal your stuff when on a team. They can smack someone and then leave.
---
But enjoy the game, it has a charm.
---
You're right about that, im not sure if anybody else is having this bug but im *this* close to reinstalling fallout 4 just to have a fun time

Anyone else have issue of not getting the items?  I linked the account, twitch says I claimed it, but I dont have the icon or suit.
---
Ugh. Been there once. But not nearly that kind of loss. Ive used the private server trade dozens of times, and it's only shit the bed once. I know it sucks , but it's way more reliable than it used to be doing the same thing with public servers, which is how I used to roll. Best advice is just do a little bit at a time to soften thw blow when it inevitably screws up. Still worth the 1st money for the reliability alone...
---
When I fast travel to my camp I always fall off the mountain and break a leg or both lol.
---
Happens now and again.  Haven‚Äôt quite been able to work out why.
---
I'd appreciate this as well to let my friends know which toon I'm using.
---
Sinse the game came out i only got two things off there both Loot bag skins buying the colour Blue was not what i signed up for
---
I always thought that pricing was a glitch. I usually sell it for around 120. Which I still think,is overpriced. It's certainly a useful plan. Probably the one I use most often. BY a wide margin. But a grand???

All I want is a lever action skin, and I was taking a bit of a hiatus when the pioneer scout skin was available. Shame on me.
---
Or shame on BGS for making it a limited time thing? I don't spend my daily atoms often at all. I would likely pay double atoms and be content, if the item were available.
---
Whatever they did seems to have actually broken the game for a lot of people. It‚Äôs worse today for me than it was yesterday. Blue screen crashes every 10 minutes now. It‚Äôs not playable.
---
It‚Äôs a bug, been around a while and only happens rarely.
---
I really wish they had mannequins for your camp
---
Is it enough?? I‚Äôve only been able to test 2 pieces vs the SBQ ‚Äúpiss‚Äù and to me it was unnoticeable...would all 5 Poisoners pieces protect us?
---
Yep it's the same way for plans and stealth boys. On a private server they will not spawn.  But I do use my private  server for farming. If I collect all the lead from my normal run I collect around 800 pieces of lead.  Then I leave the private server and go to a public server for about 20 minutes and then return to my private server the private server is now reset and I can collect another 800 pieces of lead.
---
Yeah idek what they did today.. but I‚Äôm back to crashing 3-4 times an hourüò≠
---
I will try it, thanks
---
It absolutely still works.
---
I‚Äôm just trying to keep the private server up. It took ages to get all those workshops. What I don‚Äôt understand is why it was fine an hour ago and now suddenly I can‚Äôt stay in game for more than 5-8 seconds before it crashes.
---
I was sitting there doing the math. "I get atoms either the 24th or 25 when my 1st reups, but that's 7 days away and these items are for 6 days....fuck" \*opens wallet\*. Luckily whatever they add this tuesday, will be around when I get more atoms.
---
Because till today I never had that problem
---
That sucks man. You can still get in though which is good, I get about 5-8 seconds before I crash. This is literally unplayable.
---
I think 5 might be over kill!/ diminishing returns, not 100% sure, I would say 2/3 would slow it down enough for pvp? I run 1 piece on my bloodied melee and it stops her from dying in 2 seconds, and I can run üèÉ 2 if I do something like a vault raid
---
I'm Jewish, you're full of shit.
---
Yup. My crossbow with all VATS perks does sneak damage up to 1000. Regular damage is around 250.
---
Cool, thanks!
---
I still have my fallout disc from 2015 and I played that, it was kind of cool going back and seeing how much I built the game up, I had forgotten so much. Seeing human npcs gave me hope for wastelanders and now it seems like the game is collapsing.
---
That super sledge is a one hit wonder
---
Snipers dream
---
Ridiculous water use increase. I carry 60 purified all times now. Before 20 was plenty. What ATOM store convenience item will this generat
---
You earned that shit. I think eventually they will come around with a way to unload them. Create a mule. Another character to hold your crap. Throw everything into a container at a location. Friend request a few people on the map. Check to make sure they show up on your friend list (often times they won't.) Log out and change to your mule character. Go to your friends list, find one of the people you friend requested and join game. Take the stuff out of the container. It's not reliable. Something will go wrong about 20% of the time and you'll lose your stuff. But if it's that, or have it clog your stash space, or just throw it away, 20% odds aren't that bad. Alternately, bite the bullet, pick up first and use a private server. Same method but near 100% reliability. Still not perfect, but close.
---
I can barely spawn in 76 to even see a robot if im lucky i get to see my santatron
---
Awesome weapons. Fingers crossed for Wastelanders!
---
All high level pvp is the same. You locate your target, pop a stealth boy, high voltage heffe, bufftats and psychotats, a grounded serum, bobblehead and magazine, then as you approach your target, slam down 2-3 quantums right before you start shooting and drink more every time you reload so you have constant heals.
---
Take this video for example, you see them all quantum chugging nonstop. https://youtu.be/egplb5j0_oM
---
That is a beast
---
Awesome arsenal! I swear I have got maby one weapon with LVC ever and it was some scrip roll otherwice
---
I would have a lot more customers to sell weapons too if that were to happen.
---
I tried, it eithe routs me in front where I want to be or behind a vending machine. But like 80+% of the time it's vending machine hell for me
---
Those kind of purveyor drops really make your day :)
---
I have never rolled a be weapon :s
---
I... don‚Äôt understand.
---
Solid drops there!
---
Because it is enormously annoying to have your workshop sieged from within by Supermutants without any warning. Twice.
---
Maybe it's intended for some reason, or it's a consistent bug, but if no then I'm the person who had the misfortune of stumbling into it.
---
I really like that they added the plasma plans in the gifts, was kind of desperate to find them before
---
I‚Äôve looked into the technical side of what would cause these issues on the players end, like internet connection speed, ping rate, etc, and everything on my end is, to quote Data, operating within established parameters. I‚Äôve done every bit of trouble shooting and nothing has changed. The game was working fine for me before the update then it just started blue screening and the people i was playing with were having the same issue. It seems to have gotten worse as the days have gone by. I stopped taking over workshops because I was wasting so much time and resources only to have to server crash. Then I was able to play longer and it seemed fine, now it‚Äôs blue screen crashes within 10 minutes. I really hope they address this because I‚Äôve stood by this game since BETA and I‚Äôm about done with this crap. Videogames are supposed to be fun not a challenge just to turn them on.
---
There isn't any. He just made it up, just like all other apologists who continue to pretend that the devs are *very* hard at work and as a result, Wastelanders will be an amazing never before seen game that will win GOTY every year forever.
---
 Hey Griswold! Where do you think you're gonna put a tree that big?
---
Fuck you pay me
---
Good stuff! I also use the LMG for couple hours every few weeks to get rid off my .308
---
Went to Glassed Cavern, had 3 or 4 before I fought the Scorchbeast. When he crawled ojt of the ground, 4 scorched spawned next tk me. Two were 3* santa and kne was a 2*. All this nerf stuff is confirmation bias p much.
---
That thing melts. Mumbles gives me all the heaviest scrip weapons she could find
---
Wait... there are subtitles?
---
Happens a lot near nuke sites for me.
---
I just can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs actually this bad I think I‚Äôve been in denial because I‚Äôm such a fallout fanboy. At least before I could play the buggy mess, now it is actually unplayable!
---
Super! Somethimes if you wish someting really hard it just pops out
---
Yesterday I found Plasma Mine plan for 50 caps and most mounted heads I was missing on my alt character for 100 caps each :)))
---
kek
---
It's actually a Playstation rule that forces your account name to be visible at all times instead of the character name, because of the voice chat. Any Playstation game with voice chat has account names always visible so you can report people screaming offensive things.
---
I got a nice two shot explosive lever action I can maybe come off of for the right caps.
---
The whole game is a scam.
---
Oh, well I didnt know that. I may have to consider a new name then! That makes so much sense too. Hopefully my character name isnt taken :)
---
#1 and #5 whoah. Legacy weapons are super fun to use and that .50 cal is top tier
---
Or any wall light that small. I prefer the mothman torches
---
The subreddit is run by paid off mods too. Posts criticizing Bethesda are deleted.
---
Yea I can spawn in but then it crashes after about 10 minutes. I spawned at my camp, locked the Santa Tron, scrapped some junk, then the game crashed when I went to use the stove. I play videogames to relax so the unreliability and unpredictability make it kind of stressful and unenjoyable. How can they charge people a subscription fee for fallout 1st when you can‚Äôt reliably access what you‚Äôre paying for? They need to refund people if they can‚Äôt fix this ASAP.
---
Are you on xbox
---
I say good luck to them if they find me they can have it. My camp is pretty difficult to find cuz I made a lil bunker
---
I quit playing. I got tired of the predatory monetization and lack of engaging content that goes along with half-assed, poorly built, Early-Access games. Seriously, I can't mod, I  have to pay for a feature that was in a previous installment (looking at you Fallout 1st), and how the Fallout brand is being drug through the mud. If Wastelanders doesn't impress me, I will toss 76 in the "I have no interest to play" category of my games, but keep up with the drama. (I find it more interesting anyways.) I'm content on playing Fallout 4 and hyped for the awesome mods that are going to be released/W.I.P. ^-^ 
---
(GRIM terrifies me. (o.o))
---
my vampires ffr tesla does the same with 120-150 ammo.
---
since its a benevolent bug i expect it to be patched soon :)
---
Dude I am in the why the hell boat too. I lost a couple thousand in serums yesterday because I froze up when logging in with the second character. It wasnt the games fault, it wasnt dupers doing their thing, it wasnt my ISP, my video card decided it was update time. not later but exactly when I was mid transfer. out of all the things that can go wrong with a pc, an online game, and the internet. you need to do small transfers. I lost a couple thouseand, luckily I make more smaller transfers rather than big ones. I have only had one issue with this. however even when not transfering often things can get wonky. 
---
An expensive lesson to learn but hopefully you dont make such huge transfers in the future.
---
You were right üëç
---
Im not subscribed to fallout 1st but if i was id regret getting it about now, ive tried everything to make this work but i cant find anything. Granted its probably my internet company working on the lines thats making it do this but i dont know it hasnt done this before this point so maybe thats the case. But that doesnt excuse bethesdas mistake
---
\^ this guy gets it.
---
If you were on PS4 I could sell you a good weapon for the right caps.
---
I didn‚Äôt misread, but you definitely clarified. Thanks for the info.
---
That's a good roll
---
It would be quite the coincidence if your internet company was having issues the same time as so many other players. I got fallout 1st knowing it was dumb but hoping the support would incentivize them to make a better game. But no, they are just bleeding the very loyal fan base dry at this point. Enough is enough.
---
What if my internet company is in kahoots with bethesda?!?
---
Thaaank you, my favorite personal drop. It's on a primed Gatling laser
---
How hard can it be to release something fresh after a year? And did u buy fallout 76 wanting to spend more
---
PC of course. You have the 10 star handmade too? Lol jk
---
This game is crashing right now like the Hindenburg, look at all the threads about the game crashing and being broken since the last update. Whatever they did they busted the game.
---
Any proof?
---
It seems to me the spawns are way lower solo compared to my grouped runs
---
The power you hold is to not support that.
---
 we were fighting the queen almost all of us were over 300 and tanky as crap we killed the crap out of the queen super easy barely an inconvenience and then a 3 star legendary rad scorp rocked all of our worlds lol. I died twice before we finally killed it.  its rare but its funny as heck when it happens. rad scorp was like "oh you guys think SHE is the badass? hold my beer."
---
Uhm, didn't one of the recent patches change things so you can't put stuff into corpses anymore? Suitcases still work, though.
---
Hmm. Guess I‚Äôll have to try and get a team together to try it.
---
Then the world is a much darker place than I feared
---
I hear ya. The problem at this point is the community white knights. I get you love and support the game but just be honest with yourself. Its not okay what they keep doing. They play stuff off, lie, steal and manipulate. That said, i just love the fallout universe so i log in from time to time waiting for wastanders.
---
At this point its guaranteed a failure no matter what. I will still play it though.
---
This went from "Why is bethesda so dumb"
---
To "what if my internet provider is sabotaging our games in the word of the great godd howard"
---
black bird power armor came back out recently and I finaly got to buy it. I missed it the first go around because of work. I am glad they brought it back. I personally dont give a poop about christmas stuff but I am sure a lot of people would like the santa suits and sleigh and stuff. share your "badge" dont be a grinch. completely opposite of what the christmas crap is about. well I mean if you're into chritmas crap.
---
Happens sometimes at the end of the spawn cycle after it's been nuked, after the radiation goes away and before it returns to normal spawn.
---
I've given up troubleshooting this game. If every single other title I own perform flawlessly then clearly the issue is not on my end.
---
I've uninstalled and reinstalled so many times It's just funny at this point.
---
I've submitted every crash report over the course of an entire year not that it did any good.
---
This is not rocket science.
---
I accept online games are always going to have teething issues. But 1 year in to have a state of stability that is equals to if not at times worse than launch is a joke.
---
I've seen people here on this subreddit crying out for a test server and I couldn't agree more. 
---
You can't just keep rolling changes straight into the game and cross your fingers - you need to have it out through its paces, uncover the bugs there, address anything major that comes up and then and only then subject the rest of us to the remaining minor bugs that you can't seem to fix.
---
I am both excited and at the same time dredding the arrival of Wastelanders next year. Excited because I'm hoping it really adds something special to the game.
---
Dredding it as I'm afraid that something special will simply be new and improved bugs and even worse server stability.
---
Im not convinced its rng at first i thought it was then i noticed early in the morning the rates were normal im thinking it has to do something with it being cleared once already might be a respawn timer on the holiday ones

And fast travel 15 seconds after the timer finishes

If your on Xbox or PS, request through them.
---
PC - ticket to Bethesda.
---
You might get lucky with Xbox or PS but I don't see a positive outcome from the ticket to Bethesda
---
I say if you had fun, it‚Äôs money well spent. I get what you‚Äôre saying tho, people are paying real money for things that don‚Äôt really exist. Besides, after the last update and patch the game is so busted a lot of people can‚Äôt play it long enough to even spend money. You know you‚Äôre in trouble when they can‚Äôt even keep the game stable enough to sell micro transactions.
---
I could swear i remember bethesda putting that in one those itv things they do a while ago
---
Or they can go nowehere near the bench and attempt a take over just by pressing the back/ workshop mode button and thus not get shot by those turrets
---
I wouldn't get my hopes up if I were you, the atom shop's target audience is not you, it's the people with compulsive/impulsive spending behavior.

Would be nice but would be annoying when people build trap bases to kill u for fast traveling there

There‚Äôs a difference between criticism and just angry abusive language. I think a lot of people come on here in a rage, and mods aren‚Äôt going to take that seriously. Just my guess.
---
I still dont understand why this isnt a thing
---
Never post while high, kids. See what happens.
---
hehe "mildly insaner"
---
 just be patient a buyer will come. 
---
I have an air ship  [https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb](https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb) 
---
so vendor 1 is always legendary weps and armor, vendor 2 is always food medicine and nukas. because you cant have an airship without airplane food. Vendor three is nothing but serums . one of each type. I start getting annoyed at sorting if its not an easy list to look at so no plans or any thing else on 3. Vendor 4 is nothing but ammo1 per.
---
I dont sell explosives or explosive ammo no one seems to buy itbest sellers are 5.56 .45 .308 with 5.56 easily outselling everything else. that being said if peeps arent buying you out you probably have it priced to high. 1 per is fair anything higher peeps are far less likely to buy.
---
I always knew he was a commy explains all the red
---
Athlete and hunter are easy ones, the kill a Yao guai with a syringer one is a bit misleading. Get it almost dead with a decent weapon then rifle bash it dead with the syringer
---
Haven't crashed once since maintenance, did crash 3 times yesterday, never blue screened
---
NO
---
BUY IT
---
DON'T THINK
---
Yeah, I've had more CTDs today then the rest of the time I've played the game combined.
---
oh yeah I always drop plans and unwanted ammo off near my vendors for customers to browse though just in case they want it. its even better now that its in the form of a gift box. I notice more people stop and look into them now that its a box.
---
700 atoms = free
---
Just play the game and get the atoms for free. Why pay for them?
---
strange in numbers with marsupial and bird bones was fun when it bugged out and stacked :) Wasteland Skywalker
---
Have to say I was worried that yesterday‚Äôs hotfix would nerf it. 
---
Then suddenly I‚Äôm getting more 2 stars than one and tonnes of presents in the santatron. 
---
Scrip limit is really annoying now though. 
---
I keep dropping legendary care packages for new starters üòÖ
---
Whaaat you spawn scorched from pulling ore??? 
---
How in a combined almost 200 levels have I not known this! üòÖ
---
Thanks. Yea I‚Äôve never gotten anything from a ticket support that you don‚Äôt read on trouble shooting forums. I‚Äôm just done being supportive, with words and money. There‚Äôs no excuse for this, at this point we‚Äôre hurting ourselves by giving Bethesda any money.
---
They way I look at it is like this. 
---
I spend 700 Atoms ($7) on something digital
---
Other people spend ($7) on a shot at a bar
---
Tomorrow I'll still have that digital purchase. The person who bought booze will not....
---
We‚Äôre in a vault tech experiment with this game
---
Funny üëç
---
I have a Strangler + Harpoon. It's the only way how to fight on equal terms with bloodied folks with those omnipresent BE Lasers that wreck everyone (especially PAs) in an eyeblink from 300 meters... This way we both die, sub second ;)
---
You can don Poison resist armor or opt out of bloodied build completely - it will get destroyed by quite a lot other builds (as you might have noticed), not just stranglers.
---
I like where you are going with this. I would very much like a closet or dresser of some kind to put my insane amount of clothing into. Would be cool to display the NW challenge clothing too. I started carrying every armor piece I own around just to not have to scroll through all the clothing.
---
What part of the game can't you play?
---
I thought Bufftats and Psychotats don't stack; or do they?
---
Your paying and supporting Bethesda's bad decisions , so don't complain.... I haven't spent a cent and been playing since the start because it hasn't came out of beta yet.. but it's still a good game without spending money...
---
The different parts of the buffs stack, so you get the perception bonus and the health bonus.
---
that‚Äôs the spirit üçÜ
---
If you can spare the space, but a sapling in a box. It will be good for 10-15 years and you can resow it somewhere after that. The first 2-3 years it will be too small for big decorations though. And it is usually cheaper.
---
After a year tho again, how hard is to make something even slightly different. I u didnt get to play the beta u cant imagine the state it was in then. The blackbirds paint isn't seasonal and it is it's own thing.
---
How do you manage 400-500 gifts a day on one character?
---
You can buy 4 or 5 papers a day. That is 10 gifts with chemist. Say you get lucky and proc duper all the time, so you have 15.
---
Assuming your lower estimate, that is another 385 that needs to be farmed. In 12 hours that is 32 per hour or one in less than every two minutes.
---
Please share your wisdom.
---
Fake Santa vs Robot Santa, true spirit of Christmas!
---
learn to control your impulses then
---
The keywords slowly appear through the week. You have to wait until or says complete. If you want to do it properly. I did the first time, then nuka-crypt after that!
---
lol yes
---
I did not know that
---
There's nothing stopping you from banking atoms towards future purchases. When Tuesday came around and all of the new additions to the shop, I had 300 left over from last week's daily and weekly challenges. The only thing I want from this week is the fireplace which costs 500. As of this moment I have 450 from having done daily and weekly challenges done on Tuesday and Wednesday. I should be able to get the fridge on Thursday with daily and weekly challenges I do today. 
---
By the time next tuesday rolls along, with new content added, I should be back up to like 250 atoms again. 
---
You don't need to get every little thing. You don't need to pay real money. Just be frugal and plan ahead.
---
Spending the caps to move your camp would be the solution. But I‚Äôd rather keep my 40 caps.
---
Honestly the cosmetics in this game are totally overwhelming and underwhelming at the same time for me
---
I should have added that you currently own.
---
Loving the event too! Except for the fact  I keep getting antler and ragstag wall mount plans lol I want the lights and a mothman wall mount! Pleeeeease üò©
---
I read here someone who had calculated odds from mined data. There were 40% chance to get at least one large gift after 40 hours, medium and small had higher, something like almost 90% to get at least one small after 40 hours.
---
So yes, they increased the chances from ridiculous to what they probably should have been from the beginning.
---
So have a brown paperbag with raw fertilizer and toilet paper too. If only we could set it on fire.
---
Or can just buy. And also, in warframe, you have people that can help you grind for those items, and when it's vaulted, you still have the relics that can let you unlock them
---
It is not 5 a day you can only have 5 on you at a time get 5 then craft them do that till you clear out the vendors and then farm them clearing all the places that have scorched then leave private server and come back to rest mobs and vendor
---
Nice weapons you have there! Mine are my Bss + Strenght powerfist, BE 50.cal &amp; my lovely tse lmg.
---
Nah. X/0 = undefined {X!=0}
---
From what someone calculated it was 40 hour playtime had a chance of 40% for 1+ large and still less than 90% chance for 1+ small. That means they were so small that if you played all day around 24/7 you could still not get a gift and the chance was still there.
---
The bug was the very very low chances.
---
I got some out of a whitesprings cash register, marsupial was one, and I forget the other, also some lead cocktails or margaritas or something in the same register
---
I think you're looking for r/market76
---
I got the gift of coal and fertilizer. Lot's of it.
---
It's only because people keep buying it that they keep adding it.
---
I do not understand your need for this "vanity badge". sounds silly. good luck to you all the same.
---
Appreciate the info. That gives me hope! Gonna start my build later.
---
Do you have to own a work shop for the santatrons to find a present?...I had mine at my camp and he never found a present.
---
I forgot to mention, my "5 a day" assumption was based on buying from vendor, selling stuff, buying again until you hit daily cap cap.
---
Assume it would be possible to get alot more with a ton of caps and trades.
---
I only use two, BSS +S DCG, BFFR less vats handmade
---
That dude that did 99% of the NCR. Cant remember his name but he was also in an anime I watched recently (Fate: Zero)
---
Your name a "Hey Arnold" reference btw?
---
There is. Long Johns are sleepware and they are underarmor and can be worn under the clown outfit.
---
Running explosive weapons is nice if you invest 5 points in the matching perk, but for me who play sneaky sniper this is barred.
---
My main i an Lever action rifle with Instigating, +10% while aiming and reduced weight. The rifle is moded with reinforced, armor piercing, supressor and long scope.
---
I play with 2 characters - heavy gunner and stealth sniper. For the first one I mostly adore BE90 Gatling Gun and BE25 .50 Cal, for the second B2525 Handmade and BE25 Lever.
---
I had the game on every day, for an obscene amount of time.
---
There was one present the day it released. After that first day, not one present for the entire week. The odds of that alone are astronomical.
---
But then you want me to believe my whole raid clan group, entire friends list, and multiple discord servers all had not *one* present amongst them that entire time after that first day (and these are gamers with long play-times)? 
---
Impossible doesn't even come close.
---
After the first day, they broke it in the update, and it was not working. Saying they only increased the odds is an obvious lie, and one I'm unsure why they'd waste good will over. If they were just honest, people would understand. But lying to my face about an obvious matter just makes me not trust other statements I'd have no reason to question without this pattern of behavior. 
---
I'm not toxic with their studio, and I don't needlessly complain. I'd understand an explanation that they missed it breaking in the update and expect nothing further in return. But I don't deserve to be lied to. When they do that, they are the ones introducing the toxicity they complain about.
---
Bloodied Gauss Rifle 
---
Unstoppable Monster
---
Bloodied Grognake axe left my inventory randomly so I‚Äôll say instigating mole miner gauntlet or bloodied fire axe
---
Platform ?
---
You can buy a bathrobe from ws iirc
---
Time to go turn on damage numbers and shoot some Brahmin !
---
I agree the apologists are annoying but the sarcasm isnt really necessary. Wastelanders and 76 have potential. Reason most of us are so frustrated with 76 is that so much of that potential is wasted.
---
Stop giving them money!
---
totally agree i like a bit of roleplaying with my characters and i think meeting a player called "Interloperfanatic" or "BOS-Knight" would be more fun than trading with "sniperhustler___69" or "pothead420" :D
---
btw if you read this and its actually your gamertag please dont be offended
---
How do you like the tse lmg. I have a ffr anti armor lmg. The thing is sick.
---
Whelp you seem to be a fun person
---
Yes that's my build a heavy gunner.  Although I wish I  wouldn't die so much from using them. The blow back from the gun is murder.
---
They're in-game, for a random encounter of Super Mutants vs Liberators. I've had it spawn a couple of times - Super Mutants seem to have a phobia of Liberators.
---
Very nice AA guns! My current top 3 BE90rw laser rifle, BE25 fixer, BE faster move while aiming Gatling plasma
---
Now this is news to me!!! You've just made that challenge a lot easier. I already like the asylum hat, outfit , and sunglasses for that very reason.
---
Mines my trusty ghoul slayer explosive gattling gun, anti armor explosive combat rifle and vampire explosive 10mm smg.
---
They have saved my life countless times and can depend on them to get the job done. I also have on my person 20+ other weapons ( don't ask, I've got attachment issues lol)
---
So you had the bloodied grognake axe just disappeare from your inventory. Man that's crazy.  I still would be complaining to Bethesda about it.
---
Yeah, I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was something I could message Bethesda about for PS4. Do you think I could?
---
But since patch #15 (I believe) you can decide to hide the tag name displayed over players. This is even more "roleplay" to not know who you are talking to if they where a mask.
---
And if someone feels offended by your tag name, he can hide it too.
---
With the update on the 19 they increased the chance and owning the camp I do not know but do not do the defense unless it is scorched only do retake it is easier
---
If they got rid of the stupid limited time BS, it would be easier on people who live paycheck to paycheck. End of the month comes and my bank account is just screaming at me...but of course they release all the Christmas stuff now...like...do it in the first week of December and keep it up till the end of December! Not just a week...jeez.
---
What really bugs me is that super limited stuff...back when it was only available for like a day and now it's gone? I missed out on this adorable cloche hat! :(
---
Well I really don't know even if you did complain it probably wouldn't do any good.
---
1 and 3) yes, you craft/apply them like anything you'd get from the Atom Shop. You can craft them in adventure on any character, and they'll appear as purchased items in the Atom Shop for you to favorite, to spawn with them in Nuclear Winter
---
2) the challenges section of the menu should lost them, but they unlock one day at a time so you won't see them all right away
---
Because of you I just submitted a ticket, I‚Äôll let you know how it goes!
---
Definitely one way to look at it. I'd rather have a digital purchase than a hangover any day!
---
It shows more than 2k but i know my actual play time should be less, I login but often have work to do so my toon just sleep or stand at train station sometimes lol. Over all I feel that the drop rate of usable gear is quite generous in this game. If you keep playing, the stuff would just keep coming.
---
Thank you for the prompt response. Really appreciate it. I'm still pretty new to the game and brand new to Nuclear Winter. Happy holidays, friend!
---
Private server... I took 3 workshops and build a santatron on each.
---
I agree, but we guys need to understand one basic thing. 
---
Atom Shop exists NOT for our pleasure. But for game monetisation. So everything in this shop is calculated by marketing department of Zenimax. And this guys know how retail works, so they know what people will actively buying some shit if there will be a "ONLY 6 DAYS LAST CHANCE" bar.
---
I'm loving it! I didn't play before they nerfed the tse but it must have been incredibly op because it still shreds stuff like crazy. Can imagine, that ffr on lmgs doesn't give creatures a chance to notice you before they're already dead, must be an ammo eating beast though üòÖ
---
Hey I'm like this bethesda will get all they can from us in the form of micro sells.  I just gave 100 dollars for the year subscription to fallout first. So if that happens to me hell yes they are going to hear from me.
---
Most leave them unlocked. My highest theft was 14 presents in one Santatron. My presents now chump! Lmao
---
I‚Äôve been thinking about fallout first but I just can‚Äôt do it until some things change like how glitchy the game is. It crashed on me five times yesterday. Plus the atom shop structure is frustrating currently.
---
I‚Äôve been tempted here and there but I‚Äôm waiting. How this ticket goes will impact my thought process even more 
---
Hopefully in a positive way
---
Yes the grind to find lead and steel and gun powder is insane.
---
Maybe whatever additional protection they've added against the item and npc spawning cheating, is causing issues with players? Just a guess...
---
Yeah i am! What's your gt
---
Xbox
---
This has been a very informative post i am level 332 and and have learned some interesting things I never new..thanks
---
Yes I know what you mean.  I currently have 2 charters that are weapons mules lol.
---
I rememeber grinding like all hell for the Blood Raider excav over like 3 days
---
I wish the atom shop wasn't.
---
Characters
---
I left it out so people could loot it.  :D
---
OMG all of this turns out to be a corrupted interface file--- I did a integrity check of my install, and now everything is fine.
---
Until now, the Private Server in mode selection menu was showing exactly the same graphic as Adventure mode, I never even saw the other graphic before.
---
And now not only does Private Server have Team Only or All Friends options, NW now has a "Team Fill" option that wasn't there before.
---
 I didn't know to expect to see anything different so didn't realize there was a problem.
---
What I do with any alt I start regardless of endgame build targets. 
---
1. make board, add spikes.
---
2. make throwing knifes. as many as I can. 
---
3. first three points are always pharma farmer
---
4. 4th is always green thumb
---
5. path is always vault - moonshine shack - lumberyard - farm - slocums joe - flat wood -  agriculture center - sunshine meadows - then silva homestead - silva is always where I put my first phase camp near the water and corn crops. 
---
at that point you can use green thumb and the daily quest reqards to create an endless supply of healing salve and desease cures, you have tons of pickable food to sell to merchants for your daily cap. 
---
I eat corn soup at first because it does food and water. 
---
oh heal salve = blue flowers  red flowers boiled water
---
desease cures equal orange mushrroms snaptails and red flowers. 
---
you can find all these ingredients in abundance along this route. push the main story untill it gets to hard. repeat the grind rebuild heals and supplies push again. you will outgrow throwing knifes in the ash heap. at that point use whatever weapon you are speccing for. use knifes and the board for everything else. you do not need any perk points in 2 hand or throwing  to kill all the forest. I tend to keep 50 knifes for awhile once I get to 15 to 20 ish just for roaming the forest. outside of the forest I use my main weapon, the rest of the lead and steel goes to ammo if I am using a weapons. 
---
I can be level 50 in a day or so without rushing or struggling much. basically with enough heal salve you can healtank a lot of stuff thats too high level for you.
---
Maybe they could introduce a new mutation. ‚ÄúWarm Heart‚Äù 25% less chance to get frostbite but all chems bobble heads last 25% less.
---
from my experience living on whitesprings, not even an assaultron and sentrybot can stop those chad ghouls from breaking into your base lmao
---
"dont feed my deathclaw, ty"
---
25 is a good price for that.  I do a lot of shopping (and selling), and I'm seeing a lot of vendors selling everything either super cheap or super expensive.  Picked up the Plasma Grenade plans for 5 caps from someone that just had them all at 5c to clear them out.  Other people are trying to get hundreds for Mr Handy Buzz Blades, so it's pretty all over the place, and that's part of the fun.
---
Instigating explosive handmade, executioners handmade and a mutants mole miner gauntlet with faster swing speed.

Where's the fireman helmet?

You rolled that .50 cal by yourself??

That be fixer would be my dream weapon xD

I got 5 in the Big Bend tunnel right now.
---
RNG is RNG.
---
Awesome!
---
Hi OP, I'm 50/50 agree with you which means there are few points to be disagreed with.
---
FO76 clearly is a GAAS and consistent cash flow is what makes it running, we don't like it, no one does. At the end of the days, sadly it's not player's decision to make the game running (players would love to have this kinda illusion around), its the decision to be made by executives in the board room who perhaps doesn't play this game at all.
---
Premium stuff is the current cash cow along with 1st membership, your post of wishing Bethesda could turning the ship is in someway, meaningless, sad but true.
---
**At this point, it would be great that Bethesda could balance the resources of developing premium stuff and new content, that's our only hope.**
---
We see ourselves protesting against everything a GAAS could be these days but there is no stopping on this wagon.
---
**Threats with bombs dropping, on the other hand, will not help anyone at all. So long goes with the other hatred comments made in your post.**
---
You can get 1.4k caps each 20 hours selling to any vendor (for example the one in Flatwoods). At low levels the best way is farming, literally. You can pick the tatos, corn and mutfruit from the farms around the Forest. Also pick everything, flowers, meat and junk. Don't scrap the junk, you can sell it to vendors. You can setup a route in order to kill animals, pick-up plants and loot junk around the low level areas.
---
Keep in mind, at low-level you can't normally get the 1400 caps. That task can even be hard to a high level character. Don't do anything boring for you. Keep a balance between fun stuff and grinding. But farming in the forest can be fun.
---
Lol strange. I‚Äôve also seen frozen enemies for moths now but this time they had health bars and took damage until they regerated it all lol
---
Well we do get free updates...you don't "have" to pay for a private server but yes it's a dick move to put it behind a paywall and if they locked mods behind a paywall...they'd never hear the end of it. They'd lose whatever fan base they have left at this point...modding has always been key in Bethesda games, if they tried to put it behind a paywall...hell would break loose upon them.
---
Grow them all at your own camp?
---
I can agree I'd like to fear when someone pulls out a fat man or rocket launcher. I was pvping someone the other day and they pulled out a fat man. I stopped moving and told him to use vats and it did nothing to me lol
---
I was like. What tree, I don't see a tr... ooooh cool.
---
Unfortunately its not
---
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm trying to find some, so I can start a farm
---
I need to do a few more of those...honestly i'm a bit lazy and i still need it to get my backpack!
---
There are tons of ways to fix pvp.
---
 Remove buff stacking. 
---
Remove the ability to slam quantums at full health.
---
Add a cool down to quantums
---
Remove the stacking heal over time from quantums. Stimpack heals don't stack and quantums shouldn't either.
---
Remove the arc from the Tesla unless you directly hit your first target.
---
Make stealth boys deactivate when you deal damage.
---
Add a delay before you can attack an owned workshop.
---
Remove the ability to seek revenge if you die at a workshop.
---
I could go on all day with serious ideas for fixing pvp, but for now I enjoy pvp at lv35 or less. No teslas. No legacies.
---
Ahhh gotcha. Mutfruit is also up by vault 76 if you follow the path down
---
I have never crashed on  a private server, got disconnected once. And it was pre-maintanance. Care to share your hardware and isp specs?
---
Never bothered with any serums always to expensive
---
Username checks out.
---
Log out of your Bethesda account and log back in. Items should then appear in the Atom shop.
---
discord?
---
GT: Kurt Cobain (#4312 on XB1, no numbers on Xbox 360).
---
I get whet you're saying. I never interpenetrated free update, only to mean content updates. A private server is also an update to the game, but tents and stash boxes are content. Spilled milk, you know.
---
Lets just hope they don't go that far.
---
Absolutely not. But on that note.  There are a lot of ways to play Nuclear Winter.  Now I understand that BRs and PVP in general is not for everyone but there should be some way for you to play, given the build variety, for you to get some enjoyment out of it. 
---
As far as XP goes survival time is the most reliable.  You can make a  "Chicken with it's head cut off" build that specs into running around and tankiness to survive all the way to the end. Remember if someone is shooting at you, they are giving themselves away and hunters will come to investigate the commotion. So simply Run around and heal like a maniac and a squad will come to kill your attackers.  And maybe you slip away. 
---
Going a nuker build is also good for xp.  Just brief case detector and hacker.  Hack a terminal to see enemies on the map and nuke a cluster dead center. 
---
Not big on PVP and have friends? Be the team medic.  Pharma farma, and the good charisma cards will let your team carry you as you become a heal dispenser. 
---
There's a lot of ways to play Nuclear Winter, but it's up to you to fins a way for you to have fun.
---
Sure I'll help you, gt is mortymeister I'll be on in an hour or so

A bunch of people were picking the lock on Santatrons earlier. 5 caps aren't a deterrent.

TS weapons &amp; vats = not good
---
It's also possible to abuse this feature, by placing a fast travel mat on a trap base or something.
---
Tbh, I always assumed that private servers would have a cost, but without all the extras - more on the line of a Minecraft Realm than what's there now. And I think it they'd done it that way, more people might be buying them.
---
An enclave eyebot like in fallout 3 would be pretty cool to have in your camp.
---
That keyboard comment was fantastic
---
If I ever need any of these I just hop camps, a lot of camps have all of those
---
But that's just one aspect of it - when in group vs group on a flat surface, it will probably turn into teslafest. When in 1 vs 1 or 1 vs group, the fight can be much more nuanced and interesting.
---
Ah, ok, i never seen supermutants fighting against liberators, only most times fighting against Protectrons, in Westtek as example, all outside from Bot parade events from enclave with mr gutsys and assaultron.
---
The Supermutants say in german from the soundfiles "Quietschdose m√ºssen sterben \*sigh\* halten still" "Schnauze, haufen Schrottmetall"  "Sterbt Metalleimer!" that fits. Thanks!
---
So i only need to see them fighting against Liberators.
---
Nuka World had a working rollercoaster,  why not Willard's?
---
I'm curious, what is your CPU?
---
It can seem like alot to do but there's a few that's really easy and don't take much at all
---
Pretty sure that's where people are living in wastelanders isnt it?
---
I run a heavy gunner build myself my top 3 heavy weapons are my bloodied explosive plasma gatling, bloodied explosive lmg and bloodied explosive. 50 cal but its a tigh between that and my bloodied explosive Gatling gun.
---
Well I thought maybe basic servers would be free...like base game + DLCs...but no mod support/no adjusting things like enemy spawns or whatever...you know options most hosts have. And paid servers would have all that extra jazz...and maybe slots for more people?
---
I think that would have made more people happy...a good balance.
---
For many situations Froglegs is a get out of jail free card.

Beep beep. Mine?  Froglegs.

Surprise gunfire? Froglegs.

Chem fiend murder hobo with a polehook charges you from his bush home?  Froglegs.
---
Didn't pay attention to the map and now you need to scale a cliff? Froglegs.

Enemy skipped leg day?  Show them the power of the high ground with frog legs!
---
Is gravity being a bully to your best friend Grenade Rifle? Give him a boost with froglegs!

Don't like pesky pathing up structures the seem to have a clearly intentioned design?  Froglegs lets goes where you please!

Fuck. Frog legs.

In testing it, I believe the plans and stuff stay in containers until you log off the server.

Hey Stormy! Float your ass over here and magic me up another wrench!
---
The small backpack came out way after the tadpole one probably because people were moaning about how hard it was to get 1
---
yeah thats something I have wanted for awhile. in the first few months I kept swapping them in and out and trying to min max for pvp. then after awhile I just quit pvp and went full on pve. 
---
you can have full damage and be very tanky with quite a bit of QOL perks always on as long as you dont worry about the pvp aspects. My PA Ultracite Laser gat guy can solo the queen in about 10 minutes. so tankiness and damage wise he is great for pve.

as far as camp perks i always have on contractor, ammosmith, super duper, and green thumb the only time I swap perks is to use hardbargain.  I only eat melons so no cooking and pretty much only get out of my pa make 5.56 to sell once i get a bunch of lead stockpiled. I take powerplants for fusion cores without crafting. eat melons with no cooking, and use stealth boy mod on my x-01 so I cant get vats locked. havent died since I adopted this strat  though many have tried I always slip away before they can get me. when youre already prepping to fast travel away before you arrive you dont leave much of a window for pvpers.
---
Meh, there are ways to prevent getting your workshop taken, be creative people!
---
Even having player-made cosmetics would be cool too.  It would be almost no different than the Creation Club from Fallout 4.  At least then more unique things will be in the shop to choose from.  It is a win for everybody.
---
We really need a separate stash box that‚Äôs shared across characters. It could be just 200 lbs. Most people that are still playing have multiple characters. And if you don‚Äôt have another character, hey more storage.
---
It's always been horrible.  I miss at 95% multiple times in a row, dozens of times a day, literally every time I play.
---
you can buy adictol and antibiotics  in the medical center of the enclave bunker as well
---
I done it with the archery athletics (had blast running down the ski slope) and the mammalogist goggled the location of all the animals to photograph the hardest part of that was milking enough brahmin
---
What you prefer, caps or gifts? Im at work aswrll now so ill you be on in about 4 hours?
---
Kudos. All plans go for 5 caps in my machines. Maybe you'll come across me next time
---
Oh no, I don't have god tier armor and I take a ton of damage too. Mirelurk Kings hit hard as hell.  Just after you get used to what is going to fuck your day up, you start to get a second sense for when to hit the stimpack hotkey.  Half the time I've stimmed before their hits have even landed.
---
365 is perfectly reasonable carry capacity **without** calibrated shocks. Do you have them ?
---
Right now the meta is bloodied faster fire rate handmades with less VATS cost. That's probably about the most expensive and sought after right now along with Quad Faster Fire Rate Teslas for PVP. And yeah mutations haven't changed much except with the way Adrenal stacks damage now. Electrically charged and unstable isotope can trigger PVP, so be mindful of those mutations.
---
Right?  I get that Bethesda has to make money and all but these limited time items do no justice.  Some of the things are cool and all but they make me think twice about buying it.  The rustic sink they had was cool and would have been great for my CAMP but since it was a limited offer I chose to pass it up because I did not want it too much.  It was just a skin for the water pump essentially.
---
I hate to do say this but I would rather see more bundles than limited time offers.  If you really like what the bundle has to offer you either have to play and complete lots of challenges or buy the Atoms you need.  The deals are also not that bad, at least most of the time.
---
Personally I would love to see a Merc Bundle with the outfits that were added in the GNR Creation to Fallout 3.  Basically the Merc outfits from Fallout 3.  Other things like CAMP stuff would be nice too if they were included but mostly want the outfits.
---
Yeah. I'm still looking for armor with the effects I want plus wwr.  For some reason I insist on it being scout armor, so finding just the right pieces and effects has been really hard.
---
Sounds like a problem on your end mate
---
Tell you what, hook my low level char up with .45 shells or gifts and I'll give you em for free
---
Happens every time my new character loads into her camp.
---
How do you find doing events as a sneak player? I started of sneaky, but found the events hard as a sneaky rifleman.
---
Very good to know, thanks!

Think you made a typo. You meant a couple minutes right? Lol

Huh I didn't know they had a gap in their arms like that
---
I think you‚Äôve stumbled upon the business case for this game when it was pitched: How can we, Bethesda, utilize the Fallout IP to take advantage of predatory microtransactions like our peers? Answer: Fallout 76
---
3700x on an auto overclock via ryzen master at the moment. 
---
Cpu never hits over 50% according to overlay
---
Whahahaha.. looks nice.. üòú
---
It ain't recent does explain it all though very shocking I was hey I recognize them doing this just made it all make sense cause alot of the time you don't even realize what they are up to
---
Something is off if this was yesterday as workshop santas were raining gifts. Ho ho ho. So was my camp santa. 
---
Holy hell do the bad guys hate santabot though.
---
Daym, that NE plasma must tear things even with the first effect being suboptimal during the day
---
Yes. All 3. Many mediums and a few large. Tons of smalls. Sometimes I'd have 2 of each.
---
2 of them yes.  
---
They are located in Challenges -&gt; Character
---
Yup. So many things just go *poof*.
---
I think that too. Also trading is a huge part for me to get the exact stuff that I am looking for
---
A total of 0 people have joined so far, but I am not giving up on this. XD
---
Really? Every time I exit PA my normal armor is removed and it has done this since I downloaded the game last Christmas. I assumed it was another ‚Äúfeature‚Äù
---
Haha, yea xD it just eats everything
---
How much can you carry outside of PA? If you can carry 265 with a backpack, then you are getting the extra 100 bonus. If your thinking about the extra 100 youd get just by logging in while wearing it, that was a bug that was squashed in the last patch. It wasnt mentioned in the patch notes, so its unclear if this was intentional or and accidental fix. If you want more carry weight, get calibrated shocks put on your PA legs, and a motion assist torso. Motion assist only adds 10 though, so its not the useful in my opinion.
---
How do I report bugs? I‚Äôve never had to before
---
If it‚Äôs really cheap, yes. But I normal avoid buying components I can easily gather. 
---
And I also have about that many on hand as well. Just wished they would stack...
---
I use a junkies faster fire rate less vats fixer and love it
---
I read they have pre requirements, is that correct?
---
The duped ones.   Jk lol
---
I was like that for the black ops under armour but I missed it any
---
I have had three of them in my machine for 50 caps for ages and they don't move at that price even.  Guess I should come to your server.
---
It wasn't a skin 4 the water pump it was just a sink I bought it lol
---
Junkies faster fire rate less vats fixer aae laser and je less vats handmade
---
Did you get ‚Äúserver disconnected‚Äù or did it crash back to desktop/console?  Crashes are usually local issues or bad code on the developer, not server side.
---
You can claim/contest a Workshop anywhere within the boundaries. You don‚Äôt have to be anywhere near the Workbench.
---
Is there a way to avoid duped items if shopping from players? Or, if you accidentally get one, is it likely to get wiped away?
---
Theres always going to be a shift in metas. And who uses a bloodied build to pvp?
---
300 was the decided price for me.
---
Ill let others speak to that, except that if you see anything 5-star, it‚Äôs not legit.
---
I never experienced this, but you have to complete each to unclok the other.  
---
e.g. To get the presents (250 xp) you have to unclock the wreath (1 xp) and so on.
---
Yeah, somethings up

You can do it!

Oh ok great, because on the ITV they said we had to do challanges to unlock them, I though it might be to unlock the chalange, not the item
---
Croquet Mallet is a Atom store skin for a non-super sledge. 
---
I have (had) one. Please remove from the list.
---
Ah, okay. Gotcha!
---
Oh hell no, unless they can be used to display armor.   
---
Those things really creep me out, not sure why.  They don‚Äôt have same effect on me IRL.
---
Same with Jangles.  I shoot him too, always.  Leave him sitting there headless.  üòÇ
---
I had that perk for a while too. Was very helpful to complete some of the magazine challenges
---
this particular mallet from imgur album was created by cheat
---
does it have to be in the forest? Sunday brother's cabin in the mire has a full vegetable starch garden.
---
Its to force people to buy atoms with real money.
---
Trying to stick to the forest as I‚Äôm not doing well for weapons and armour at the moment - hence the need for adhesive
---
Wait wutttttttt

This.

Without Calibrated Shocks is about right.

With Calibrated shock on both legs 465

That was my last challenge. I did it literally yesterday, and I had 0 problems with that one. I did nothing special, so I don't know
---
They don't wipe normal items even if they are duped, buy whatever you want. But if someone is selling a cheap godroll fixer or handmade, it's obviously duped. Honestly I would avoid trading for a top tier gun immediately because a big part of the game is just playing with different guns, there is no endgame so don't rush into getting endgame equipment or you'll get bored fast.
---
Saying I‚Äôm NOT an impulsive buyer, hence the post.
---
That‚Äôs super great for you but I want 4 things for a total of 1700 something atoms haha. I‚Äôll probably end up with none of those. The point of the post is that I would like to be frugal and plan ahead but stuff is only around for a week and I can‚Äôt grind 1700 atoms in a weekü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è so I just choose to get nothing.
---
Omg me with the greenhouse bundle.

Good point. It's about the journey not the destination, I guess.
---
I've been playing fairly consistently ever since the last major patch and I haven't crashed at all.  Same goes for my PC associates playing with me on Discord - servers very stable.

They had mentioned at the [QuakeCon Panel](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/458711608?t=00h30m07s) that they had planned to normalize combat a bit. They are pretty vague with this so it could mean they would scale damage up or down for players of differing levels, balance weapons substantially or maybe something entirely different. Though he did say it was ambitious so we will see what actually happens when they drop Wastelanders. Similarly this was also mentioned in a [GameZone Interview](https://www.gamezone.com/originals/interview-fallout76-e32019/) towards the end where the phrase "Wholeistic balance pass" was used to describe it. Though, both of these sources are a bit older coming from this past Summer so things might have changed.   
---
They keep saying they are fishing fixes from the pond of Wastelanders to throw into the live version as of late, especially for armor and weapon fixes so its probably safe to assume a lot of fixes and changes might be coming still in some form or another.   
---
^(I'll believe it when I see it.)
---
I‚Äôve played since launch... no that is not what is supposed to happen. It does that with hazmat suits, not power armor.
---
That's where it's supposed to be and it's not there. Went up and down all options.
---
And the Xbox. Nothing.
---
Tatos and Mutaberries can be found in Flatwoods.
---
The earliest corn I remember is at the Moonshiners Cabin right south of Vault 76. It's not a plant, but the fruit lying around at a table outside the cabin.
---
Does the plan not spawn still on the table of the archery range in the scout camp?
---
Are you checking them twice?
---
A bunch of us...
---
My heavy gunner runs a JFFR with VATS crits boost .50 Cal (also have a JE), a JE Gatling Gun, a JFFR Faster Reload Cryolator and a JFFR Faster Reload Gatling Plasma. He also has a Quad Gamma Gun and a JSS Fire Axe.
---
My Bloodied Commando uses either his BE Handmade or his BFFR Laser generally. Got a BE Railway for tough enemies, and a BE Pipe Rifle for trash mobs as well as the Unstoppable Monster.
---
What platform? I havnt seen a viable bloodied pvp build since the damage cap. Theres just no reason to run a low health build when theres better options. Sorry, didnt mean to come off rude, just woke up and havnt had my morning coffee yet. Lol.
---
it used to work with pottery plants. corn at least.
---
Great!  More wanted players to kill!
---
IF and I say IF  you can find one hands down the anti armor explosive gatling plasma gun. Its considered a legacy weapon.  I know of only one and they want 120k caps.
---
That Black Knight looks cool.
---
Hell all I get is shit and coal so go right ahead. I got the dumb bot. Just my luck.
---
Wont that make them Wanted?
---
Well, I guess that answers the P.S: question.
---
Yeah but then you have to rebuild your entire camp as well
---
That image isn‚Äôt showing it for sale in a vendor. 
---
That‚Äôs an image of the item being inspected from an inventory, not a vending machine.
---
Same lol, to be honest though I was offering 60k for a plasma grenade plan last month, I got two now and I've only spent 40k ish!
---
Exactly, DE knows how the economy works
---
yes, correct
---
They only thing I can confirm with certainty is that the weight and damage are not correct for a Sledgehammer
---
I'll not be available till about 12pm your time, is that any good for you? Also what would you want for them?
---
You literally just said "I want 4 things for a total of 1700 something atoms haha" and now you're saying you don't really want anything. I don't know how to have this conversation with you.
---
Yeah that works! And you can have them for free, I thought I would use them but literally never do haha
---
Can‚Äôt be soft, it‚Äôs brutal out here
---
Go to the DMV in Charleston
---
I am bruh, aus
---
I dunno, a discount on release would only further this ‚Äúimpulse buying‚Äù you‚Äôre talking about....
---
Tell me about it! My holy grail was the laser gun medium scope, as I knew almost all other plans. Got it in my first batch of presents and now have duplicates too
---
Yea. I hear ya with the toxic stealthboys tesla. Its the main reason i quit pvp as well. After the strangler armor though, ive been engaging in pvp again, mostly because i can whoop on the tesla boys. I dont use it until some pulls a tesla out, then i teach them the error of their ways. I typically run a junkie commando in all other situations. If someone spanks me with just an outright better build or tactics, i tell them GG and move on. Pull a tesla out and imma make it rain poisonous explosive plasma balls from the sky. Lol. Switchi g to a junkie build is super simple. If you can procure a decent weapon, just get 5 addictions and some decent vangaurd armor and youll be ready to go. No respec needed. Just an addictol so you can switch back to your bloodied powerhouse.
---
Also works
---
can't i buy my preston garvey? xD
---
I drop mine at train stations too.
---
A legacy weapon is a weapon with legendary effects that dont drop anymore for example any explosive energy weapon.
---
You are correct or doesn‚Äôt work anymore, my bad.
---
It doesn‚Äôt register. There is no option on the terminal after I chose the ID.
---
Yea i used the hacks thats why i know the only thing that gets you banned is using the scripts no need to be toxic when someone proves you wrong i just dont want false info out here there is already enough bullshit being told in here
---
You have to look around. But as other people have mentioned, it can also be easy enough (maybe/maybe not at level 41) to just go into a super mutant camp and kill everything, collect the weapons, and turn around and sell them. Just  make sure you‚Äôve popped a grape mentat and your Hard Bargain is equipped as well.
---
AAE Gatling laser (i dont use)

Wait. What camp are you referring to? Camp McClintock is where you do your basic training. Fort defiance is where you ‚Äújoin‚Äù the brotherhood of steel. Have you been to fort defiance (aka the Asylum)? Once you go to the 3rd floor of fort defiance and try to register with the BOS, it should trigger you to go to the dmv.
---
Yeah they are crazy OP. Feel bad for new players having to do the main story and go through the wendigo cave after they buffed them.
---
But its impulse buying that keeps the servers going. Without an form of income, this game would not be possible.
---
For the game, not fallout 1st. And it took a year of threatening law suits before Bethesda finally said "Fine, we'll obey your stupid laws, protecting customers and upholding the basics of Capitalism"
---
PA is mostly useless. Haven't used one after lvl50 when my armor effects are more important, not to mention carry weight which is 400-500 with armor and 160 with PA (20% lighter weapons, ammo, food ect.) and normal armor nowadays had even higher DR than best power armor I have seen. Absolutely useless other than in cosplay effect
---
Yeah, I had an issue with this. But it's the exception not the rule in my experience but at the same time, it leaves a bad taste in one's mouth. Now I just hop til I find a lower level and offer them things.
---
Agreed
---
I went back to FO4 and some great mods. If it's been a while, it'll almost seem new to you!
---
I guess it would be great if you could filter players out by level, but that wouldn‚Äôt exclude low level mules. :)
---
I think it's around 159-160
---
Sorry nothing like that in WWR have Zealot Sturdy, Combat, Exterminator Scout, Vanguard Light raider, should have Lifesaving soon but need decide which piece of 2 to keep...
---
Good stuff. Now I take your concerns and complaints seriously. You have made your case.
---
I do this sometimes too, but the fun in this game, is to group with people to do stuff. I never understood the appeal of playing alone. Making friends and destroying content is more fun, with a group, than it is solo. So I rather be in a map with some high level players.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But yes, I agree, it is the exception, just irritating when I see it happening.
---
Oooo you can build santatrons at workshops?
---
You looking to sell? I‚Äôll take the combat rifle for 10k caps :)
---
It was half a joke lol just saying some kind of system saying, this account I don't want in my vendors lol
---
I'll allow it...personally I'd go with PreDog.
---
If you have done it in that order :
---
- Fort Mac Clintock, complete quest and got certificate first
---
- Went to for Defiance and initiated the "Blues" quest
---
(or started the Enclave quest to become General, it is the same at this point)
---
The quest marker should first direct you to Fort Mc Clintock again.
---
Just go there and talk to the Instructor Gutsy.
---
The quest marker will then move to the DMV in the Capitol of Charleston.
---
Upon entering check on the left for a Spervisor trunk and a terminal against the wall right beside it.
---
1.  This isn‚Äôt showing the item in a trade window. 
---
2. The Atomic Shop icon can glitch out and not display properly on rare occasion. 
---
The other items are legit ‚Äòcheat‚Äô items. This one is confusing. 
---
That‚Äôs my point. 
---
I get that he‚Äôs trying to help. But this particular item needs more clarification, and it would be best if he explained it more clearly in the post. 
---
Any player that doesn‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs a legitimate skin who sees someone using it would potentially get the wrong impression.
---
I hate going to wendigo cave myself and level 230 last time there was daily i died 5 times cuz i was runnin low on stims
---
YES! it's amazing I played with the wacky weapon mod for HOURS before I even left my camp the other day, it's a whole new experience for sure with mods
---
Working fine on Xbox one X in both private and public world's. Been playing for 4 hours today with no disconnections.
---
It does. At night, I could solo the ISS with a bunch of super stimpaks countering the three pylons, in a total of about 40 seconds
---
if i was you id keep the instigating hunting rifle or the AA leveraction and try to get hands on a AA handmade or combat rifle for situations where you get crowded
---
After sleeping on it, I could see the different look on the fireplace being intentional,  as it's clrarly meant to be a "faux" fireplace and I realize that most people probably do use their walls right-way-around (which actually makes the Santa Smash decoration make even less sense...)
---

I know that, but since it would be 25 years after the great war, all industrial machines that cause global warming would have stopped working. I looked Appalachia's average temp and it's much higher then you said, but I'll take your word for it!
---
Thank you for the advice!
---
Hope Beth will fix this asap
---
Don‚Äôt forget to equip Green Thumb while you are gathering and Super Duper while you are cooking/crafting.
---
That's a great Idea! and thank you for reading!
---
Anyone interested shoot me a message on here or XBOX at CapAm40. I'm pretty much on all the time after 1pm CST so you'll definitely have someone to play with.
---
Not that we only have to do law enforcement things. I can help with missions or just other stuff in game. I'm really just looking for others to play with since solo can get boring.
---
We can always go hunt for X-Mas gifts üéÑ
---
Yeah, I will admit that my usage on the walls was atypical,  but your last point is what really had me scratching my head.
---
Well games sales probably keep this game afloat somewhat as well considering it isn‚Äôt a free gene.
---
Same here,  that's why I flipped the wall around.   I hardly ever see my camp from the outside, anyway... üòâ
---
It sure wasn't easy to remember the passwords for twitch and bethesda that i never use.
---
in generall id say it would be cool if the microtransactions were actually micro 
---
i saw a lot of stuff in the atom shop that id happily buy for a dollar or 50 cents and i have the feeling that overall this would generate more income than how it is atm
---
but im in no way a professional on the topic and i am sure bethesda has some people hired who run the calculations so they probably know what they are doing even if it doesnt seem that way for us normals
---
yes we can !
---
Oh, man, do explosive weapons not drop anymore?
---
Please help us slim down fo76, by deleting your redundant posts
---
Thry can release anything they want the atom shop. Im still saving up my atoms for that enclave bundle they will someday release.
---
Welcome to marketing...
---
Always wanted to see Frank vs Lanius. 
---
Honestly I just wish they made a decent fallout movie. 
---
Surprised no ones attempted a real one yet.
---
Here's the thing. Put stuff for free in your vending machines cause you don't want it. Don't be concerned with who takes it. Putting free stuff in your machine and then taking photos to shame people when you decide they've taken too much is just fucked up. Of your "faith in the community" is shattered by people taking advantage of free things then you never had much anyways.
---
Wow it looks very festive!
---
Very nice. Would love to have that as a poster.

 Big city slam, boys

My level 15 character keeps letting level 30 super sledges, grognaks axes, and shishkebabs. None of which I can use.

Note the perks to have a bit of "tanking" for short range combat, Blocker and Adamantium SKeleton.
---
I don't do it because I don't want it. .38 is used by newer players. Same for .308. Handmades and Radiums I could scrap for resources, but I feel it's more useful to someone else. 
---
If I simply didn't want them, I'd not pick up this stuff. Instead of having it take room in my stash. This might blow your mind, but some people do like to help.
---
Did you use a doorway to make the hole for the fireplace? Want to know if I can make one of these myself.
---
F
---
Explosive weapons do still drop.
---
Can you complete that sentence?
---
The quest marker is still at Defiance but I‚Äôm stuck at the elevator with the lasers. The terminal right on the opposite tells me that I can‚Äôt get in.

I want the responder and chinese power armors

oddly enough last night when I went to mod my colors of my t51 the responder skin popped up actually but said I needed to snag it in the shop so kind of confused by this
---
Faster fire rate anti armor handmade rifle.
---
My minds not blown by people wanting to help. My mind is blown you put things for free in your vendor and expect total strangers to understand your expectations.
---
Looks toasty warm :)
---
It's all good, keeps me hunting.  I have a ton of Vanguard's in my machine.  Not sure why but that crap constantly drops for me usually with AP refresh.  Doesn't seem like the R in RNG works like it should for me.  Same effects and almost always on combat armor.  With such a huge pool to pull from damn near 30 percent of my armor drops end up being this.  Unless I roll from the purveyor, then it's assasins wood or trapper over and over.
---
Fireproof bricks not the same as usial bricks, it's ok when fireplace bricks is different
---
I want that Santa suit but am just 120 atoms short I still have time I hope.
---
I accidentally scripped all my armors once because I forgot I was wearing Power armor and they were not showing as equipped. Oops!
---
You have to go upstairs by foot, initially. Turn around and start heading upstairs. Don‚Äôt go back through the blast doors. Go the other way up. If you see a bunch of mole rats and/or insects, you‚Äôre going the correct way.
---
Exact the same for me on my lvl 22 char.
---
Yeah I use the regular door place and set it half of block out from the wall
---
Did I miss those gift boxes? Are they in the atomic shop right now?  I have a brick fireplace set up with nuclear winter stash boxes around my faschnacht bonfire üòÅ
---
I was holding out for something interesting to build and then the christmas lights came out and bam! I bought them like a flash. I love the default lights, use them all the time. Although I wish either via ATOM shop or in-game we could get more faction-based items. We've seen raiders and Free States, why not the Brotherhood or Enclave. Maybe a little eyebot pet that scouts around for enemies in camp, could have a series of different paint schemes.
---
I have the suit and love it. I was saving for the Christmas bundle and when it wasn‚Äôt a bundle I had enough leftover to get it. Also a great way to get atoms if you haven‚Äôt already done this is to do the ‚Äúkill 76 scorched with x type of weapon‚Äù challenges.
---
Was talking with someone else on reddit about this earlier! Maybe a little robot to tend to the garden or something haha
---
I've never understood how is it a good business model to only offer most of the outfits for a limited time, surely they'd make more profit if the bulk of their stock was made permanently available to everyone. As far as i know, there isn't a set rotation for their clothing stock, so if your like me and want a specific outfit you'll have no idea when the outfit you've saved up for will be back in the store.
---
Well most people did understand, clearly you aren't one of them. The good ones understood that I could have left the loot on the ground, but I took the time to pick it up, and put it in my vendor, so people who do not have the plans, or need the extra ammo, can have it. I'm glad most the community could prove you wrong :)
---
Maybe it was just frustration that drove me to this.  I've seen a lot of other people on here talking about getting them early in the event or getting multiples of them...but it seemed like all I kept getting were multiple mounted tics and mounted bloodbugs, which I already had anyway.
---
See Pm :)
---
I would have this happen very rarely for basically as long I can remember, since patch 16 it‚Äôs been absolutely rampant, especially on private servers in my experience.
---
I got the plasma mine early on and got super excited when I saw the words "Plan"Plasma..." and then my heart sank when I saw it was the mine.
---
Thanks for the correction!
---
Good to know!!
---
hi id like to check out your store if you are on ps4, my id is FritoZ
---
thank you!
---
 I‚Äôm getting higher quality legendaries than usual
---
geeez‚Ä¶ I've been getting crap, just crap‚Ä¶ but I don't care‚Ä¶ the event is cool, and scrip is always welcomed!
---
Cool, thanks! I‚Äôll have to use this.
---
I actually found it out because I was trying to server hop between public and private at valley galleria for the scorched. Every time I went back to private there was nothing, so I ran a few tests
---
They could allow us to Sponsor a programmer.  We'd get weekly updates on their project, and  performance, along with their opinions on current FO76 world news.
---
Got the quest done and the new backpack.
---
Now of course im eyeballing the upgrades in the vending machine.
---
Anyone know how many possum badges you get for completing one of the world quests?
---
I read you can server hop for a daily quest that has a low drop rate on the badges.
---
Wondering if I get just 1 or if I get alot of them for a world quest.  They just seem like alot of hassle and not worth doing if your only getting 1 badge.
---
haven‚Äôt gotten anything yet
---
Maybe it was just RNG coincidentally hitting while I was on my alt.  All I know is that I have an ungodly amount of multiple plans from my high level character, shopped myself into the poorhouse buying wrapping paper, and went on a one-man Scorched genocide mission without the plans ever dropping.  But with my low level alt, I had them before opening less than 10 gifts.  It was probably the fifth or sixth gift I opened.
---
Stealth nerf 
---
Just like Watoga bots no longer spawning legendaries because they were so plentiful I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs the case 
---
Bethesda is constantly monitoring feedback on this site and making adjustments
---
No, I gave up &amp; maxed out my budget with Christmas lights &amp; Mounted heads.
---
AAE .50 Cal, AA Ultracite with improved fire rate (thing's basically a laser auger), and lately a TS Prime LMG.
---
Great idea to place it in a doorway like that!  I may have to borrow the idea...üòâ
---
No, I'm not saying the plasma grenade plan is level locked, but that things like the T-45 pieces are.
---
When i get home this is gonna be my desktop background
---
Only explosive energy weapons don't drop anymore. 
---
As for the one he's talking about, it's rare, and it's valuable, but I have that and a bloody explosive variant; I still use my bloody faster fire less vats handmade. Nothing compares.
---
I think perk loadouts (a system were you can switch between between sets of perk cards with a simple click) were planned for the first quarter of 2020.  
---
So basically you could set your perks for repairing and save that perk profile. next time you need to repair, you would be able to select that profile so you don't need to replace all the cards individually. At least, that is what I gather from the limited information about this that is available. I have also heard that that kind of system is already available for PC players as a third party tool.
---
I almost have all the disease and workshops just one left each then I can do kill scorched with a crossbow
---
I would scrip or sell every single one of those two shot weapons.  The majority of them are garbage (no offense). 
---
Bloodied, AA, Furious, Quad, Vampire are what‚Äôs up.  
---
The All Rise can be shit canned as well
---
Ah okay, cool. Well, I'm sure I'll find something to my liking eventually.
---
Okay cool. I remember having a 2 shot explosive something or another. I think I still have it, but I can't remember.
---
Nicely done!
---
Will he get them after the event?
---
That was one of the first ones I did and it gave me a new love for the crossbow! Enjoy!
---
I just heard one yesterday that I‚Äôve never heard. 
---
It was a super mutant by liberators and it said something like ‚Äú go away spinning metal bucket‚Äù
---
You must power up Fort Defiance first (switch at the top floor accessible at this point), once that is done you can use the terminal outside the elevator at the 3rd (?) floor - it will tell you you need to get an Army ID. Now you can head over to the DMV
---
Lead = Lucky Hole Mine
---
Steel = Literally everywhere
---
Gunpowder = just make it, way easier that way
---
This is only tangentially related, I know,  but I have been missing the ability to deck out my pool table with the pool cues, etc.  (I did this in Fo4, and was disappointed to find the items just ended up in a paper sack when I dropped them in this game... it's the little things like that that gives a camp that lived-in feel.)  I would totally sacrifice a little bit of my budget for that.
---
Great work, do you have one without the text in the middle? Id love one with just the characters!
---
You play on ps4?
---
I think different items in that tab go on sale on different days. They just aren't very good at clarifying that.
---
they from NW right now need 250 exp i believe.
---
* Silva Homestead is the best source for **Corn**
---
* General Steakhouse is where I've found the most **Tatos**
---
* **Mutfruit** is all over the forest near Flatwwods &amp; Overseer's Camp
---
There are also a good supply of tatos at the Farm where the Airplane is, can't remember the name, I don't spend much time in the Forest region.
---
The exact weapons that dont drop as explosive anymore are: Gatling laser, laser rifle, gatling plasma, ultracite gatling laser, ultracite laser rifle, tesla rifle, assaultron head. The other energy weapons never did. Also the double (double ammo capacity legendary effect) is too legacy.
---
Well were they really a faction?
---
It seems they were composed of about 5 people who had bigger problems to worry about than having matching outfits. Also most of their time was spent in bunkers so they have no reason to show off a group symbol.
---
The bundles represent what we as dwellers have created in memory of the previous factions that existed before us. Thats why we have bundles for everything including Free States, but no base game Free States items imo
---
Use the perk that reduces explosive damage, and a dense/ padded mod on your torso.
---
Tough to say 3 best.  Here are a few 
---
BE auto (primed) handmade 
---
B25 auto (primed) FFR handmade 
---
AAE auto handmade 
---
Quad FFR fast reload combat rifle 
---
Quad FFR auto Tesla (I know cheese)
---
Quad explosive fletchettes Harpoon 
---
Bloodied FFR gamma gun 
---
Bloodied and Vampire FFR auto Railways
---
Furious Spiked Fire Axe with 40% SS 
---
AAE Gatling Plasma and Laser versions 
---
Action Hero 50 cal
---
BGS isn't subtle or complex in their loot tables. They add a base % chance to get the plans from the gift boxes, they wouldn't level lock anything on this holiday list.
---
I think you're giving them way too much credit?
---
Maybe...maybe I have some kind of visual bug or something. Ill check the tab every day and it‚Äôs always the same items for me...they should definitely clarify though
---
Ok cool, thanks.
---
It's in the toxic Valley so it would only have toxic water to play in....fun times
---
I just wish that all the things which you can purchase out of the atom shop were available to find out in the world. Rare, but no need to worry about the number of atoms.
---
4 Christmas scorched at a time? Thats pretty good.
---
Might also be a disease that causes damage which in turn cause inability to fast travel.
---
Same thing happened to me. Does not pay to be frugal, i guess. I got the awards from NW and was like, oh, I need the lights!  Nope gone üò•
---
It makes the top of my water purifiers look festive.  So I'm happy.
---
Really enjoyed the Holiday event. I have only been playing since October and couldn't really do the Halloween event as a lower level.  This event is awesome.  So many great locations. I got 4 legendaries just doing the meditation event then Harper's Ferry has been great. Not to mention the mines with scorched.
---
good point...
---
ü§§ü§§ü§§
---
At least until after the holiday.
---
I've had decent luck running around Charleston - the Firebreather physical exam loop, and AVE (?) medical center aren't bad. You can also check out Morgantown airport, Belching Betty, and Camden Park. It's all RNG but like I've said, I've had decent luck.   
---
Don't forget to set up your Santatron for gifts, too - Bethesda just changed the drop rates so you get a gift at least once an hour, I think.
---
Cooool. I'll be getting that later üòÅ
---
i used to get 505 when i loaded into the game with excavator PA already equipped. now i'm around 430 i think and i have calibrated shocks (one leg if i remember correctly) and the mod for the torso. to be honest it doesn't really bother me cause i just use most of the weight for carrying lost of weapons that would break down for scrap
---
i have the 60Lbs backpack so my general carry weight is 375 when i'm not in my PA, due to deep pocketing all my armor. i am pushing to get the possum badge to increase the backpack weight 120
---
That looks pretty cool!
---
Bloodied Faster Fire Less Vats handmade, Combat rifle with same effects, bloody ffr reduced weight laser rifle and plasma rifle.
---
Coool! I'll be getting that later.
---
Nice.
---
What are your favorite farming events and locations?
---
That makes sense! Cheers!
---
Thx!
---
Time equals money if you don't want to grind challenges.
---
I put free stuff in my vendors but I dont care who takes it.
---
You want rewards? Play NW, well once you reach lvl 100 that's it, no more new stuff. So yeah I totally agree with you
---
Eh no they‚Äôre bigger than 5 people. It‚Äôs just 5 people are the main characters. They have a group symbol, and you can find it all over Harper‚Äôs Ferry, their bunkers, and Berkeley Springs. Their time was spent in bunkers after the scorched came in and destroyed the Ferry.
---
It was a pre-war movement as well, so why shouldn‚Äôt their be armbands and items bearing the icons?
---
I recognize the bottom left one. It‚Äòs some Fallout 4 fan art.
---
Gauss with 556 ammo?  Damn that‚Äôs cool!!!!
---
Big bend tunnel and glass caverns
---
i'm at 375 without PA. that's with the 60 Lbs backpack and armor pieces all deep pocketed. with all the mods on my PA i used to get 505 when i loaded in. personally i'm pushing to get the possum badge completion so i can get the 120 mod for the backpack
---
B2525
---
I just don't get it why this comment was worth -4 points. You just can't say anything negative in this reddit anymore even though most people know the the criticism is true....
---
I came across a set of T60 that was just missing the helmet lmao
---
**BFFR FR LMG** (DPS is Crazy high)
---
**AAFFR RW LMG** (For the Non Bloodied build)
---
**AAFFR FR 50 Cal** (Not quite the DPS of an LMG, but still very Respectable)
---
Notable mention: **IE FR The Dragon** (13K+ damage in sneak, but it breaks crazy fast &amp; still takes a while to reload)
---
Glassed cavern or any fissure site. Kill everything, wait 5 seconds, pick a piece of ultracite ore. A group of scorched will spawn. Glassed cavern you can easily hang out for an hour and get 20+ gifts.
---
Thank god they upped the drop rates on the santatron it was a major letdown atm but thanks for the locations gonna give them a try now.
---
She tends to land more often the more people stay on the ground.  More than once in the last week, did the event and nearly everyone was on top of the drop site building and she wouldn't land.  She ended up flying back into the nuke zone and wouldn't come back!  Had to go kill her in there.
---
I'd like a behemoth to spawn out of the lake next to my camp and smash anything that starts attacking.
---
Harpers ferry would be an amazing map
---
&lt;3
---
and how much time did you spend on grinding for that? I would gues about 10 hours? Sorry, i not everyone has some much time to grind. I can only play games for about 2 or 3 hours a week and i just want to have fun not grind.
---
Have better self control?
---
looks cool!
---
I definitely would have bought Fallout 1st if it was just the servers and the free atoms. It's when they decided to pay wall the scrap box and the tent that they lost me and the Arktos Pharma glorified reskin of the fridge is when I stopped purchasing their Atom Shop currency bundles that came with an outfit (none of which I even wear, really).
---
Well that put my new fireplace layout to shame.
---
I've cleared it out and then mined a few ultracite and they eventually stopped spawning for me.
---
The one with the T-60 PA? That‚Äôs official concept art?
---
It‚Äôs either that or Charleston that will be the next map
---
Oh sorry, my bad.
---
Let us display clothing and power armour!  I'd love to have a wall with each of my PA displayed along it.  I've got one of each in various paint jobs that would look awesome along a wall in my camp.  Why is this so hard to allow us to do?  And same for adding mannequins to the display list to show off some of more rare or favorite clothing items.  and can we have in game chat please.
---
Heh stoked.
---
How did you get that wall to be out there with out snapping?
---
What they really needed to do was adjust the threshhold for small circle.  They had set it at 32 and under as small circles (which was way too much for the small circles), which ultimately resulted in 90-95% of the games getting small circles outside the rare weekend game/free weekend.  I think it would have worked better with 20 and under.  Plus, you'd constantly get small circles that had maybe 1 good spot for loot and the rest of the circle having scraps.
---
Yes.  Patch notes.
---
I farmed Always Vigilant last night... Left the repair boy broken with 1 minute on his timer and 20 on the event timer...
---
Scorched kept spawning until the very end... Got like 8-10 gifts
---
Enjoy the difficulty at the beginning! The game gets easier with each level. That is why I really enjoy playing with my low level alts.
---
Yup.
---
Hip fire accuracy boosts vats accuracy as well when it comes to mods
---
Try out all the base weapons, and when you find one you like, then start looking for the legendary version.
---
Ah hah, okay, thanks!
---
Gotta make sure to kill everything in between. Idk, we been doing it past few days getting tons of gifts.
---
It would be incredible if games changed with the season.
---
I think it will inevitably happen in a game.
---
Its a perk meant for a different time.  Id imagine it still works for taking heavily fortified workshops though.
---
Time equals money. Not everyone wants the grind stupid challengs without end and the time limited items are designed to counteract this. If you want something buy it in the next few days or it is "gone".
---
It's probably the other one. One is king and one queen I think.
---
Yes, it is.
---
It's also why PvP has pretty much zero place in a game like this because there's a meta that destroys everyone else, or at best stalemates someone else using it, and your typical low to mid-range player, or high-level player who doesn't chug down all the buffs, basically doesn't stand a chance.
---
Not to mention the rampant cheating.  If someone is constantly attempting to pick a fight with you, you can safely conclude they will fight dirty.
---
I‚Äôve been playing for over a year and earned probably around 12k atoms. You don‚Äôt need to buy stuff from the shop every week. I was saving for Xmas because I knew I wanted a sant outfit and other items. If you don‚Äôt want to grind, spend money, but buy a bundle to save some money lol. $1 should never equal 100 atoms. You are wasting money at that point. 1 month of fallout 1st gives you 1650 atoms. 1 year gives you 19,500 for $100 (that is 195 atoms for $1, nearly double the conversion you provided).
---
I‚Äôm toting a JE Laser Rifle , J ffr 50 hm and a J limb 15 Fixer
---
Thank you, i totally agree with you. But i'am very feared that Starfield will also be 16-times the monetization (if thats even possible).
---
It's nice to see not all critics left this reddit where every criticism gets downvoted to hell.
---
I hate seeing a lvl 300 buy items out of my vending that was meant for low level players.
---
Yes I do mate
---
Don't give away thing for free.
---
That kills the commerce for players that are selling genuinely acuquired things at a fair price and you are only helping greedy merchants that will pick your free stuff to refill their stock.
---
For example, put .38 at 1 cap each, if a newby can't afford a few caps for bullets then he is too lazy to play the game right and enjoy it.
---
It‚Äôs all good
---
Thought so, I've seen you on there! My tag is Seminandis
---
Are you on PC?
---
Im at 525 without PA, and when I get in excavator it goes down to 510
---
Glassed caverns + pick the ultracite nodes! Enjoy!!!
---
I just want it to be good again!
---
Been like this forever. I leveled one character to about level 85 at whitesprings golfclub, doing nothing else. Happens about 1/40 runs.
---
In the last 6 hours I crashed 6 times
---
Yea, so without the backpack and the deep pockets, youd be at 265. So 365 in excavator without any upgrades should be right. Idk how you got up to 505. If you figure it out, let me know
---
Is it possibly because the free weekend endet?
---
It reminds me of the free-to-play E3 event in Summer 2019. Suddenly the challenge were super easy in the time but returned to "normal"-shitty afterwards.
---
I imagined this like holiday commercials. 50 cents will buy your programmer a snack and keep them swimming in positive moral! XD
---
I know why they do it, but they've become completely absurd with the whole "Vaulting" idea for months now.  I'm sure some marketing guru thinks this increases profit, but can they really measure how many people *tried* to buy an item after seeing it and *failed* to do so because they removed it?  Fortunately for that guy's job, this is a Bethesda game, and they probably can't.
---
There's no reason why the Christmas stuff shouldn't have run clear to Christmas.  There is already a natural shelf life for this stuff.
---
Maybe not just rare but unicornish rare. And not just drops from the Scorchbeast Queen. 
---
You could just be bebopping your way through the world and... wow, what the hell is this modern desk doing in this toolbox outside a Red Rocket?!
---
Definitely. Vending machines and murmrgh are also great additions for legendary hunting.
---
The Hand-made is a free states weapon. That being said they got a lot of love with the atom store, I as one would love some more free items included as well!
---
I got the light the first minute I seen them. Now go those ice lights.
---
very nice!
---
I totally agree with you. What I really don‚Äôt understand is why they are doing it this way when the model you suggested would make them so much more money. It‚Äôs like they took the sales model that is proven to work and done the exact opposite. It makes no sense.
---
sadly workshops have been nerfed and dont even produce enough resources
---
Ok, good to know, I must have just had a run where she didn't want to land for reasons.
---
Switch to power armor when you go to the divide and points east.
---
I don't grind, I play a game. It is obviously my spare time which I use for enjoyment. Quests and Challenges being a part of the game, and thus, the enjoyment. But hey, you buy them and complain that it is expensive, don't mind us who are having fun and get it for free.
---
My upvotes and your downvotes say differently.
---
I prefer the 20 hour reset. Would be happy with a Holo tape that told me times like the one for nuke silos.
---
The hard part is figuring out what is for low levels?  Unless you have a sign stating so, I think you just sell stuff cheap. If there is something noting for low level I honor that. Not everyone does though
---
I came back last week at level 35 (launch).  Now I‚Äôm at lvl 52 and a second character is 15 or so.  I‚Äôm still fairly new and don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs good.  
---
2* Furious handmade/3* Vampire handmade
---
3* Anti-armor fixer
---
3* Hook with 40% swing speed 
---
I have no idea if any of my armor is worth a damn.  I‚Äôve been running around in PA for the carry weight.
---
have you done ***all*** perceding steps in the b.o.s. quest line. starts in abby's bunker. You can do them out of sequence, but you must do all .
---
I got mine in build mode Monday night didn't see them in atomic shop but did get them
---
No video game footage of yet and its been worked for years already so odds are they are hiding it since its going to be either broken and/or macrotransaction hell.
---
Did you all run this yet?  I haven't played in a while and want to try to get a diffuser.  Am having a hard time finding more than one person in the event.
---
Don't get your hopes up, I've lost several things, the most notable was all the Armor on my main character simply vanishing, 2 complete sets of High quality 3\* armor, and their only response was, **"We're sorry, but we are unable to replace Lost game items"** I've received the exact same response to 4 separate support tickets, one of them involved 650 Stable Flux &amp; 100 each Stabilization materials that were traded between 2 characters just before getting DC'd, and it was gone from both.
---
my favorite item is not on your list
---
the Q.....m P....e
---
Quess what it is...
---
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt fret over it.  People might think they‚Äôre helping you out with caps.  It would be interesting if you could level lock items.
---
I had a low level legendary handmade for real cheap.  A lvl 350 bought it, which is fine (script).  But they also bought a low level non legendary handmade.  That would be a great find for a newer player.  It‚Äôs most likely a resell for a lvl 350.
---
the absolute most I can remember having was 525, and that was after I ate some cooked radstag meat. i am beginning to think there is some sorta bug with Excavator PA right now cause my weight capacity keeps changing everytime I load in. 1 day it was 505, next day it was 495, another time it dropped to 450. when i get into the armor normally after leaving it, it will be anywhere from 415 to 430, i dunno what to think to be honest i just go with it
---
Go to glass caverns as a group. 4 to 8 players are ideal. Clear the first tunnel of all mobs, pick a ultracite node, kill the mob, do the next node, repete for each member of the group,. If you leave the cavern while others stay you can infinitely pick the nodes. We got close to 100 Christmas scortched in less than an hour with 8 people. We made 2 teams of 4 and all stayed close to each other so as long as one person from each team got a hit on the mob we could all loot it. Amazing fun and profitable to boot.
---
Quantum Peepee?
---
Great advice mate, thanks
---
How is the handmade a free states weapon? It‚Äôs from Nuka-World. And yes their atom-shop outfits are nice but they‚Äôre also pricey and only available for a limited amount of time, something unfair to people who wish to RP as this faction
---
Me, I'm more "Please just let me pay Atoms for the armor paint I want because there's no fucking way I'm playing NW."
---
same currently its better to be running around with a peice of wood full of nails
---
525 without PA? how did you pull that off? I've gotten that with my modded PA and eating radstag meat
---
i have the strong back perk maxed out, 60 Lbs backpack and whatever armor i could deep pocket and after eating cooked radstag meat the most i have gotten was 395
---
I have given the cross bow a fair shot I just couldn‚Äôt fall in love but it goes great with my outfit.
---
But girls don't play videogames.

I'm a big Atom shop buyer. What I've noticed Besthesda has started doing recently (And I don't agree with this practice) is making more items "Limited Time" items. They do this knowing full well that unless a player has been saving their Atoms up there's no way they will be able to grind out enough Atoms within the games daily/weekly challenges to afford most of the items..thus giving the player 2 choices. Buy Atoms from the Atomic shop or not get the item. 
---
Take all the Christmas stuff that just came out. Added up you would need 4800 Atoms ($48) to be able to afford all of it.  They intentionally didn't bundle it so they could spread out the cost over many items. 
---
Also note that a lot of Christmas'y stuff was data mined &amp; its yet to be released leading to believe they will do that this Tuesday. Effectively delivering a 1 - 2 punch to those really wanting festive stuff.
---
Gonna agree with this - was planning to decorate last night and spent atoms on the foil trees and a couple other things.... then couldn't find the damn lights!
---
Do they realize people have jobs or school or other commitments and maybe the weekend before is when they are going to decorate.
---
High capacity backpack mod, with unyeilding +1 str deep pockets armor, radicool, strong back, 15 str,

When Bethesda marketed the game they said servers would never go down, that there would be years of free content &amp; no pay to win mechanics. If they need more money for that they should have sold the game for more money or stated they needed bags of cash if we expected continued development.
---
Bethesda has never stated that profits from F76 will go back into developing it, Zenimax has started two new studios this year and BGS has several game in development that may have higher financial priority than F76.
---
If you want better development of the game try to convince people to work for them as they have a yuge amount of open positions. After buying F76, Rage2, &amp; Youngblood it'll be awhile before give them anymore money.
---
I suggest fixing the game and not fucking over your players would be a good start. why would you support a game that is essentially fallout 4.76 instead of showing your players some love and gratitude they show you more ways in which they will all take away your money and add more broken content. I wish i was on here telling you guys about how much i love this game and about how much i enjoy it, but the only thing i feel every time i launch this game is regret and sadness when i see that nothing about the game improved (when i compare my enjoyment and the game performance) in comparison to right now. even after i changed my entire setup and can run the latest AAA games on 144hz this game runs like dogshit. and you can't even change fullscreen or windowed during the game. I wish you all the best people, but we got fucked and we are currently being used to make money in a scumbag way instead of being seen as loving fans that want to support a studio that brought us countless hours of entertainment.
---
I think there was something wrong with how my pvt server loaded actually. There were things missing like the chem bench near collision course and a desk missing but the computer on top of it was there floating in mid air.
---
Just a griefer perk now. When I have gun turrets up at my camp I lock nothing, I just walked through my walls in edit/replace mode.
---
Rxcavator armor has been bugged like this for me for months. Relog while inside the pa to get the carry weight. When you exit and reenter abother relog is needed. 
---
I get 561lbs with my bloodied nuke pa build.
---
They need to drop the Failnite mode, and bring back Survival. It was nearly perfect, it just needed a little rebalancing.
---
The nuke Holo tape is for the silos on that server not your personal cool down. For example if you launch from alpha and hop to a clean server the holotape will say alpha is ready to launch. Which it is. You'll be able to finish launch prep and but the targeting terminal wont let you use it because there's a 3 hour personal cool down for each silo along with the 3 hour silo reconstruction.
---
They've missed out on a lot of money, not everyone has the money available the week items are available, and would want to pick them up next payday or something, the way the Atom shop is currently is ridiculous, all items should be available at all times (with the exception of Holiday items, they should be available for the whole month of that holiday).
---
I'm at 460 without any weight perks, or the bigger backpack.

Not necessarily. Fear of missing out is a thing, and it could very well be making Bethesda money. While not perfectly measurable, it wouldn't be challenging to analyze the sale of time-limited items versus those that stay up. I do agree that the specialty nature of holiday items should probably be marketed differently, as most players are unlikely to utilize these items throughout the rest of the year. It is likely the case that their marketing team is not considering it from this viewpoint, and is instead hoping to make sales based upon the holiday spending frenzy.
---
Brother how do i join the enclave on tjis subbreddit
---
Personally I'd spend more if things were available all the time. I like what I like not what's around at the time.
---
No
---
Yes i heard that too in a german soundfile for supermutants, in german translated to english its "What does that mean?  Away with stupid swirl buckets"  :D
---
Yeah I noticed this too... they have been releasing stuff in the last 2-3 weeks not bundled and divided ... making you spend big time... last week I've spent alot... I would like to get more this week but its a no go... spent my montly budget in a week...
---
Can someone explain how to join factions on this subreddit
---
Sure somewhat, but you also need to pay the bill, developers, and investors  (if any). Only a portion would go to keep the servers running. And what happens when the funds run low? They need to make an revenue from somewhere. I'm suprised FO1st came out when it did.
---
&gt; that's with the 60 Lbs backpack and armor pieces all deep pocketed
---
See thats the Problem, only ExPA WITH Calibrated shocks can complete with that. More so if they have weight reduction effects.
---
Probably Bloodied Build they can have Strangth in the 40's
---
Pretty sure it can only be done from a computer and not mobile still, but it‚Äôs in the side bar for the sub. There‚Äôs a few options.
---
The 10 star handmade post has been proven to be fake.
---
Definitely read that wrong and thought you said "Splooged"
---
It's pretty much unanimously agreed within the community that most atomic shop items are already over priced. 900 - 1200 for an outfit, 1800 for a PA skin....even if you are saving, One good purchase can really take a chunk out of your atom savings.
---
I use gun-fu along with grim reapers sprint and stay in vats all day, it auto targets the next enemy and you get a damage buff between each kill. Very effective up close
---
Line up, suckers, toss your money down that hole! Maybe Wastelanders will be what you've all dreamed of, if we just believe and all clap our hands (and fork over the cash)!
---
A tab should be made saying '1 Day Left' or something along those lines so that it's clear. They might as well put new items in the Vaulting Soon category.
---
Did you get it!? Haha.
---
I‚Äôm thinking maybe Concentrated fire as well?
---
Yeah.. I shelled out 5k for the lights yesterday.. I feel much better though.. I dont feel like I need to grind and I can just sell the plans if I end up finding them myself
---
&gt;Long Shot
---
Trash.
---
&gt;Sniper
---
Meh.
---
Tank killer is a must for me. Also max all 3 rifleman unless you like to make even more ammo.
---
Some of the perks you only equip while crafting. Ammosmith for instance
---
This is the truth. It is a scam to get people to pay to be beta testers for future games. They are honing their MTX axe on our wallets.
---
I got a full set of Vangaurd Caviler AP and i can run across the map vatsing without stamming out. Great set for my full health commando.
---
The perk says damage to another players workshop, not camp. It used to say camp I think
---
Yes at least 1 point so you can target the head. You also dont need weapon artisan unless you are repairing at a work bench. You can lower your int and just swap it in as needed. I don't use the sniper perk as it's useless in vats
---
I had 1000 saved and they bought the monthly 1st for the 1650 atoms, got back to 0... Have 250 Now.. This week weekly challanges are a pain...
---
I went the same route today for several server hops. Legendary rate seemed no change, but they were NOT wearing Santa clothes!! So I didn't get any gift today. Yesterday I could get 5+ with the same route.
---
It's hit and miss, sometimes you get 1 scorched, sometimes you get a group, sometimes you get a scorchbeast, sometimes you get nothing.
---
I've had periods where I get next to nothing for a number of runs (scorched, but no santa), and other times where I get 3-4 by clearing out all the ultracite.  It is very random, as you might expect.  But that's the same as any other location, sometimes you hit a dry spell for a bit.
---
This sounds incredible.
---
How effective was this for you vs farming scorched for presents?
---
I was literally just trying to help new players. I didn't think people were so against this, I guess from now on, I'll just get rid of my free vendor, and find a lower level each day and drop all my stuff in their camp for them to pick up.
---
Why would you pay 1 cap / bullet? I sell tens of thousands of 5.56 every few days, and I sell through Discord Channels for .5 each. Same for .50 Cals or Shotgun Shells. (these all seem to sell very well). Anything worth selling or trading, I always do it through Discord Channels. My actual vendors just have useless legendaries that people buy, because they can't be bothered to farm for their daily legendary currency cap.
---
Normally I do for weapons, 1\* = 150, 2\*=250, 3\*=400. And armor is the same, just 35 caps less, on each \* as they are worth less currency. And they sell very well. 
---
I don't feel that there is much commerce for players in this game. Before I found out about all the Discord channels, I felt that way too, but now I've had to buy a 2nd account, just to have enough characters to hold all my caps, as I'm constantly hitting the limit. My main expenses are Acid for my Lead from Luckyhole mines, Plastic to bulk my stuff, and Fusion Cores whenever i see them in people's camps. Just because I need to keep spending caps, otherwise I'd just sit at cap all the time.
---
Yeah those are the weapons the vendor sells, not necessarily being directly linked to the faction as there‚Äôs no reference to them making them and the only factional skin for it is raiders
---
Learn to be a developer. Replace the Besthesda Austin team.
---
It always reduced breaking by 50% on Level 5
---
Blah blah blah, you earn atoms in game. Blah blah blah, you don't have to buy everything. Blah blah blah rationalizations.   
---
   
---
They wouldn't do it if it wasn't working.
---
Exactly what I was thinking, looks like we got a funny guy on our hands.
---
Fuck the Glassed Ass Cavs. Stay outside and pick the yellow ore around the fissures down there by the caverns instead..We got mobbed with 5 AT ONCE. No dying and needing to race through the tunnel.
---
unless the quest requirement has changed, there's 2 other things you have to do that have not been mentioned in other messages (so far)
---
Merry Christmas!
---
No the requirements just show the components I added all Power Armor perks just to be sure and the armour perk but no luck with that
---
They don't want you to have time to save up atoms from challenges, forcing you to buy things in the limited window. It is all quite manipulative and underhanded.
---
For example, Camden park always spawn 2\~3 holiday scorched before yesterday. Today I met ZERO with 5 times of server hops. 
---
PC version.
---
Having them all reset at a specific time would be great and take the guess work out of everything. Especially for ppl that don't play at a set time window every day
---
It was the best! I'm still bummed about it.
---
It's money in the Bank. Before the event started I was spending tens of thousands for any plans I didn't know. So after the event ends and when the dust settles, if I notice I need a plan, or see a rarer one for sale in a VM... You bet I'll be spending thousands again, as will many other plan collectors
---
I think it can be ferals also... And I'm not sure if location matters, I did the one in the south of Savage Divide
---
The list for the weapon itself says it was constructed by Appalachian survivors. They are the most likely candidates for constructing them.
---
Go find a pvp group or go bully low levels taking workshops. Those are the easiest ways
---
Lol I‚Äôve messed with low levels a little. I either get bored because they stop or feel bad cause they can‚Äôt do anything back. Thanks though :)
---
It's useless? Good! Serves you right for trying to take joy in destroying someone else's stuff.
---
And you reported them to Bethesda right?
---
Oh, yes.  It never occurred to me that it could be one of those roaming events.   I have only ever noticed it in one location (can't recall which, off-hand, though).
---
It is. I have a few in my camp!
---
Encourages people to play (grind?) for the atoms to get stuff, or buy atoms with real money.
---
One may generate a larger at any give time player base/spending more time in the game, the other generates more money from the atom shop....
---
Nicely done. I have both fireplaces now and prefer the old modern one.
---
Hunter/Hunted is a fun way to PvP. Just turn on you radio to it and hope someone else joins in.
---
I will.
---
The manufactured scarcity is a problem for sure, but at the same time these type of atom shop deals have been going on since the start of the game or close to it. 
---
You should know by now items change every Tuesday and to check the timers. I‚Äôve been seeing so many posts that are a day late to get the item they want. I just don‚Äôt get how. I know if I want something I‚Äôve got until 11a.m. (my time) Tuesday to get it unless it says otherwise.
---
I do hope they end up changing this method, but with all the new styles of bundles coming out (Maxsons coat, twitch, pint sized) I feel they‚Äôre going to make it even more difficult.
---
You just bragging?
---
This community is so nice that if you tell them they are not nice they will downvote you to oblivion!
---
I don‚Äôt think they upped the drop rates. I think it was supposed to start when the actual NW event started which was the 17th. Get the free weekend players hooked and give them atom shop items but don‚Äôt get rewards from it till you buy the game when free weekend is over.
---
LOL!
---
Nah, i seriously don't know if 2 shot is worth the weight..... seems to be mixed reviews against executioner or instigating.
---
Master race
---
Yep - what I mean is they attempt to claim it but they don't actually want the workshop. I had a group come up to me when I was solo - there was about 3 of them and I just let them have the workshop and they messaged me asking to pvp instead and when I declined they just left and I was able to retake the workshop.
---
Melee.  You don't even need a legendary weapon.  Don't have to worry about ammo.  Good enough for a mule that you dont plan on dwveloping.
---
I think I probably pulled 7-8 out last night (I was on a while), they're definitely producing presents.
---
And yes, mine is locked.  I checked a bunch of other people's while I was out shopping, and with one exception, everyone had them locked.
---
I will sometimes buy nice low levels and give them away. So all may not be in vain!
---
I'll  help you in a silo gt latershater  on xbox
---
OMG! it looks fabulous! I wish I had that when built my first camp up in the mountains, it was a small walled-in homestead looking over a cliff.
---
It wasn't the very best but, it wasn't that bad either, I think that would have spiced things up inside.
---
I can probably hammer the quest out and get a free card in about 2-3 hours.
---
I can't make 2000 caps in 2-3 hours.
---
Damn. We really out here trynna have fun in the game and can‚Äôt
---
I haven't locked it.  Sharing is the reason for the season.
---
Thank you!
---
Great Job!
---
Wooow just woow
---
Yeah I wish they would leave things up a bit longer. They definitely should have had the holiday items available from the beginning of December and go thru the holidays to ensure people would be able to get them. I know it's a marketing tactic but I feel like they lose out on sales because of this, for instance myself. I don't get paid til tomorrow. So I can't spend until then if I want to - now I don't even have the opportunity.
---
I can make at least 1400 as soon as I log in
---
They don't care.  They want you to login every day.  It's the same reason they have anti-binging mechanics, like the daily cap and scrip limits.
---
76 is a reskinned Fallout 4, and apologetically so.  So of course there were a ton of reused assets, as well as a bunch of unused ones (which is not at all uncommon for many games).
---
Honestly, it's easier and safer to leave them in, since removing them has a chance to mess up other parts of the game (given that the current developers are new to the code and don't have a good grasp on what all interacts with everything in the code).
---
And yes, they take up space, but honestly application space is hardly at a premium these days, and I'm sure that on top of the breakage risks, they probably didn't think it was worth the engineering time to sift through the code looking for things that they could trim to save a little HD space.
---
Right. I have a little over 1k atoms just from playing but I'd buy more if there was something *worth* getting. But most of the time I got to the atom shop and it's pretty freakin empty.
---
The little bit of the house you showed in the photo, if you did, (or are planning to do) a house tour, give me a link to it and I'll leave an upvote!
---
Make Bounty and wait for some noobs lol
---
you're on PS4?
---
wdym? And Xbox :/
---
Yeah and the Lever Action Inlay is pretty damn gorgeous! Gives you a Henry Rifle look.
---
Yep - I missed out on the raider stuff because I didn't get paid before they left the shop.
---
Thank you brother i have done it.
---
Huh. You‚Äôre the first person I‚Äôve seen to confirm that. Thanks for the info.
---
If a player has a bounty and runs to there camp you can do damage.  Unless they nerfed that too. 
---
But I guess I rarely even see bounties now either.
---
Used to come blasting through the roof to get them bounties and add shock factor üòÇ
---
Thanks for the confirmation. 
---
I haven‚Äôt seen any yet (obviously) so I wonder if it was a stealth update or I just hadn‚Äôt gotten lucky.
---
I have mine locked but if I see someone else‚Äôs locked you better believe I‚Äôm gonna pull up that level 3 lock pick.
---
This is the way.
---
Dude the same thing would happen in real life. The stories you hear of people honoring these types of systems are fairytales.
---
I worked in a soup kitchen back in the early 2000‚Äôs and I had a guy put on a dress and sunglasses with the world‚Äôs shittiest wig and tell me that he was someone completely different than the first time he passed through. If people are willing to stoop this low for some free canned beans, they definitely wouldn‚Äôt blink twice before cleaning your vending machine out in-game.
---
Glass cavern just have everyone loot the ore one at a time that is what me an my friends do it took us 3 hours to get out of there
---
that looks pretty nice!
---
No people need to stop rolling over for these companies that are selling us broken merchandise.
---
As much as I wish this could happen, cause some of their pricing is bonkers, unfortunately that's not how all of this works. Currently if 10% of your player base is buying your additional product and they take say a 7 dollar item that is selling and lower it to 50 cents to get more sales they now need 14x as many people to buy the product to make the same amount of money.  That would mean they need 140% of their player base to buy said item to make the same amount of money which is impossible.  Even with a much, much larger player base it would be the same thing.
---
I've been working on a formula for pricing my legendaries. It's still very much in the experimenting and testing phase, so don't be hating. It generally works out, sometimes I round up or down, I'm working out a modifier system for the type of weapon it's on. (Obviously, an AA/FFR/less vats cost handmade is worth way more than the same roll on a single action revolver lol)
---
But anyway, I'll share for you to modify as you see fit:
---
Tier 1 Primary Effect--2k
---
Anti-armor
---
Bloodied
---
Junkie's
---
Two-shot
---
Vampire's
---
Tier 2 Primary Effect--1k
---
Berserkers
---
Executioners
---
Furious
---
Instigating
---
Quad
---
Troubleshooter
---
Tier 1 Secondary Effect--2k
---
Faster fire rate
---
Explosive
---
VATS crit dmg
---
Tier 2 Secondary Effect--750
---
10% DMG while aiming
---
33% vats acc
---
Limb dmg
---
Tier 1 Tertiary Effect--1k
---
90% reduced weight
---
25% less AP cost
---
VATS crit refill
---
Faster reload
---
Tier 2 Tertiary Effect--500
---
faster movement while aiming
---
+1 special
---
DRWA
---
DRWR
---
That‚Äôs a website that tells you the launch codes!
---
I started as melee/sniper.  Was given a L5 (furious or instigating, forget which) fireaxe by a high level, and found a sniper rifle on a rooftop.
---
Later upgraded to a L20 vampire machete.  Both the axe and the machete worked reasonably well.
---
I've picked up several low level bloodied and vampire weapons killing santas in the forest - given how weak new characters are, might be worth the time to try and get one for your new character.
---
Yep.  Not there
---
I know. Thats why i said its irritating. Its not to the point where i want to uninstall the game lol i just wnated to vent about greedy people lol
---
I‚Äôll chime in in agreement. I use a split on bloodied unarmed melee and semi auto rifles. Adrenaline, concentrated fire, and gun fu is an absurd combo with level 1 perks. It functions like a headshot aim bot and I use a fraction of the ammo of commando builds
---
Marketing 101: FOMO; Fear of missing out.
---
Do you have an Xbox or Play station app on your phone or Computer?
---
If you are on a Console, that is not a game issue, it's your Console Service (XBL/PSN Regional Servers), and it's the same with 90% of crashes to the Dashboard, getting DC'd back to the main menu is a game issue.
---
Get more memory then
---
Thank you. This is going to save me so much time
---
This is purely speculation on my part, but I believe you could give Bethesda 100 billion dollars and it would have zero effect on the longevity of 76. It is a cash grab, not a cash sink. It exists purely to fund and provide beta testing for future projects.
---
Acknowledge fan criticism, address it, don‚Äôt alienate people paying for your premium service by ignoring game breaking updates? I paid for fallout1st to support the game and I can‚Äôt play it anymore since the update. So they lost a player and customer. I‚Äôd like to support it but I can‚Äôt. I guess that makes me negative right? Go ahead, downvote me, truth hurts.
---
Oh I can agree there. I am kind of sad that they took down the survival servers - people who want to PVP often need a place to go too. I like PVP but not all the time and then some of my friends don't like PVP at all and get frustrated when people try to initiate. I just don't think NW is what all pvp players want either you know?
---
It‚Äôs not stealing if it‚Äôs unlocked. Those are gifts to the world! üòé
---
Meh. I low ball everything i sale.  Could care less about the game economy. 
---
My item, my grind, my choice on the price.
---
We even looted the body when I got to the weapons workbench I had 1500 pounds of weapons and ammo and a mix of legendaries
---
If it was broken when you moved it, it might not show up in the world.  Go to your CAMP ( the physical thing that plops down when you move) and try to repair all.
---
If you use the Chemist perk it will make 2 at at time.
---
I agree with ya 100%. I never played survival cause I was too low of a level to wanna play it, but now it does peak my interest
---
It wouldn't shock me in the least to learn that the entirety of Fo4 is hidden in there somewhere. 76 is basically just a fo4 mod anyway (and a poor one at that.)
---
Ah but if you complete it all today you won't come back tomorrow when the atom shop refreshes. The goal isn't quality content its recurrent user spending.
---
There are no 5*, hes full of shit lol. You can get legacies for like $5 now if you look around. I have unobtainable plans and outfits too but I don‚Äôt go around trying to sell them. Shits weird
---
Mele
---
Or they could develope the game better
---
I can't say for sure, it's possible that there's a small amount of memory gets used for those assets, but for the most part items aren't loaded into memory until they're needed, beyond a specific set standard assets.
---
When you load into an area, there are 2 things going on.  1) the game is sending you the location of the game assets you'll be seeing or those nearby, as well as the details of any assets you don't have stored already, and 2) it's reading all the items you already have cached locally into memory.  2 is usually relatively quick (quicker if you have an SSD), but 1 can be subject to any internet problems imaginable.  Sometimes things are just slow (bad connection, WiFi issues, server is overloaded, etc.), and sometimes there are 'hitches' where a packet will get lost, and a connection will be sitting there waiting for a response to time out.  That happens everywhere on the internet, if you've ever had a web page stall and do nothing until you reload, it's the same problem.
---
If you're getting long loads, there's (probably) one of two things going on...you're loading into an area with a LOT of non-baseline items (like enormous camps nearby, which is one of the reasons they have a budget), or there's a hitch in your internet that is slowing down the loading.  Or both.
---
OK sorry about the Internet 101 length post :P  Hope that helps a little.
---
I‚Äôve got 32GB of ram and the game runs hella smooth for me. Sounds like you need more memory, the game is fine
---
Upvote for the chuckle. 
---
Yes, as xxx said it‚Äôs a website. It‚Äôs quite useful. 
---
Codes reset every Monday, IIRC, so just be careful on that day.
---
This happened to me. I deleted the character and started a new one. Then I was able to add it to my CAMP.
---
That used to be a 25k gun lol. Still might fetch a decent amount even with the nerf. Just remove the mods to save weight and throw it in the stash for a rainy day. Or mule it.
---
I want a protection for my Gun Runners base.
---
I keep getting downvotes to hell for bringing up how the game is literally in a broken state right now. The game seems to have fallen apart in the last week. I had 6 crashes in two hours. I don‚Äôt have a problem with anything else, game, app, anything, and this started after the update, so I can only assume the update did something to wreck the game.
---
This legendary could be yours for the low low price of 420.69 caps
---
Upvoted for visibility.
---
Sad thing is he will find some gullible whales for sure and proceed to make $$ out of duped and scripted gear, again and again...
---
I sell my junk legendaries 40 per script. Anything good I sell on reddit(I'm not allowed to mention the sub).
---
I consider 1-star Two Shot weapons as "junk legendaries." So I'd sell them 200 caps each.
---
Here's my prices-
---
3 star weapon- 1600
---
2 star weapon- 600
---
1 star weapon- 200
---
3 star armor- 960
---
2 star armor- 360
---
1 star armor- 120
---
It took me a solid 15 minutes to scrap all the weapons I looted from there after a 2.5 hour session in the first Tunnel section, with scrapper on I ended up with just over 3600 steel from that run, and 37 gifts.
---
Poison damage needs a nerf, damage caps need to be removed or they need to make a counter to it. Everything else in the game has a comparable counter but poison damage has none. No, poison resistance does nothing, thank you for wondering.
---
The DoT meta on ESP is a gleaming example of what not to do with DoT damage. I know many people who cancelled ESO plus and quit ESO altogether because of how ridiculous it was. Hardly PvP at all... it‚Äôs just a cheese and spam fest...
---
So a bloodied, FFR, -25% AP weapon would be 5K?  Sign me up!
---
(I don't actually want a bloodied weapon, but if I saw the right weapons with those effects at that price, I'd snap them all up in a second).
---
Best thing to do is just give gifts to individual players instead of hoping a low level comes to your camp. Even camps outside the vault with "free for new players" get cleaned out. Also who knows if they're taking them to be greedy as well. I know I went to a camp the other day that had basic camp plans for like 1 cap each and I cleared them all out - not because I want to resell but because I also like giving to fresh players - so I pick up cheap plans wherever I can so I can regift them out. Maybe try not to be so critical and assume people's intentions.
---
I play on a private server 99% of the time, so if someone randomly happens upon my middle-of-nowhere non-vending camp when I'm not,  they are welcome to whatever they find... üòá
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs free real estate‚Äù
---
I leave everything open. Santatron, lead extractor, junk extractor, water...
---
If anyone stops by and I can make their day, I'm happy. Even happier if they buy anything from my vendor.
---
Hacked 5* weapons do exist.
---
Well, like I said, I do a rough modifier that I haven't gotten the right numbers down for (just kinda wing it)
---
But those roles on a pipe gun, yeah 5k is a good price.
---
Those roles on a handmade? Tough to say, but it's at least 5 times that, most likely 10+ times that
---
A while ago the plans found as loot caused this bug. If you still can buy the plans (not marked as known) than this happens here exactly. The only solution I know is to buy those plans again and build it with flux the normal way.
---
I locked mine day one. Found many unlocked ones last night. Also folks if youre gonna hide your unlocked santatron behind a locked door dont put it in a room where you put a crafting bench by a window.
---
Lol no they don‚Äôt, Bethesda removed them
---
I cant wait for them to try and release a christmas bundle on christmas eve giving us 1 day to decorate.  Hope they know I'm not buying.
---
If enemies are nearby, and you are taking any damage (includes minor rad damage) that will happen, I routinely have to run almost to the exit elevator in the Silos because of this.
---
What platform?
---
Could you please just not post an ENTIRE inside the vault that‚Äôs more than a week old perhaps?
---
Yeah I gave him a medium quality gift as that was the only one I had on me.
---
I don‚Äôt think Bethesda thought that out too well, a limited time on Christmas decorations before Christmas?  Seems stupid to me.... I could understand after Christmas, sure remove them but before? lol
---
So would you spend more money on the game if this was the case?
---
You clearly haven‚Äôt been playing on PC. 5* are supposedly to be introduced in Wastelanders. Problem is on PC people have already found a way to create them. That‚Äôs, assumedly, the exploit they patched the other day
---
It is still in the game....but now that you mentioned it, it seems a lot less than it used to be.
---
Easiest way is have a friend get wanted over and over until you reach 76 kills....Lock a door at your base. Have your friend pick it. Kill them....rinse &amp; repeat &amp; just return the favor for them after...
---
That anyone would spend real world money on any item in this game completely blows my mind. It's like buying tickets for a ride on the Titanic.
---
Cant wait until confetti guns are in the game legit oml
---
Nah, really only referring to atoms when I say plan and budget.
---
I‚Äôd just do the old dad trick of turning it off than on than logging on to f76.
---
I know, because i already stole two gifts
---
I did to multiple times. Still nothing
---
I truly appreciate not having bundles. I usually only want 1-2 of the items and won‚Äôt buy them if bundled. So at least they are getting part of my atoms instead of none
---
I did this and the game blue screened in under 10 minutes
---
I am on PC. 5* were spawned in but got removed. I had multiple 5 and 4* weapons, and have unobtainable plans, armor and clothing lol. I know what I‚Äôm talking about
---
I put it in my vendor for 2000? caps. Lasted less than 5 minutes. Later, I found that it was easily worth 10x-20x that. Oh well. Lol
---
Yes, but only a 5 cap bounty for each, and you may lose 50 trying to collect it.
---
Wanted used to much more common when base destruction was in game. 
---
Now people have to pick a lock to get wanted. 
---
There has been an uptick in wanted players though since Santatron gifts were fixed.
---
That's the correct answer ;-)  I've been thinking a little about a way to (generally) price items like that, but unfortunately it's a bit...difficult.  And what an effect is worth really depends on the item type (as you pointed out).
---
A heavy ranged weapon will be worth very little with most of the VATS perks, since they're almost useless in VATS, where a commando item will gain a huge premium with them.  For snipers, the value is somewhere in the middle (probably still low though).
---
(You know all that, I'm just spelling out what's in my head :P )
---
I've got a few days off soon, maybe I'll work on a flowchart &gt;.&lt;
---
You do realise it was released today right:  [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/66xOu1a7PVALlBVPohGqjL/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-meet-duchess-and-mort](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/66xOu1a7PVALlBVPohGqjL/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-meet-duchess-and-mort)
---
Well it worked for me but than I would just do the claiming progress over again maybe it didn‚Äôt go through other than that no idea sorry.
---
You can most commonly find dead Free Staters wearing Miners outfits, camo jumpsuits, and western cowboy outfits (I don‚Äôt know why this last one doesn‚Äôt make sense but whatever)
---
I'm not a bundle guy either but I also see the value in it to other. "if" they do want it all then normally they save by getting the bundle. For instance I really want that Red Rocket Sign but its bundle only &amp; I'm not paying 1200 for it.
---
Then I think that's the problem, because the entire point is to make people spend money. :)
---
Thank you
---
The Free States were a secessionist political faction made up of (former) Americans, and were largely shunned by the public. Except for maybe some flags, paint, and emblems, their "gear" would be repurposed, generic American gear. This would be similar to the BoS using repurposed military gear, since they were part of the US Armed Forces until just before the war.
---
I haven't tried it since the last update, but it was working last week.
---
Wait, so you say they don‚Äôt exist, claimed to have them, then said they don‚Äôt exist because yours were removed?
---
Pick a lock and get wanted status, someone will show up eventually and try to claim it. I used to do this often, but would only fight if attacked first, that way you're only killing people who want to pvp instead of annoying the shit out of people who dont.
---
They were spawned in, and removed by Bethesda with the latest maintenance so yes they don‚Äôt exist
---
I just found the guy with the serums, now I have healing factor + speed demon + marsupial. And on top of that I have the perk the heals you in daylight and healing factor so I heal 4 points every second in daylight. But yeah I‚Äôm gonna take your advice for some caps, thanks!
---
Might be destroyed, if you go into build mode, can you see it broken, should show up as yellow and just needs to be repaired ?
---
And you have 100% confidence that hackers haven‚Äôt made them again or that Bethesda didn‚Äôt miss even one character holding one?
---
I too usually carry a variety of weapons for the different areas on the map
---
I've bought plenty of stuff from online traders and sold stuff too from gameflip. I used to spend real money on weapons till I figured out it was cheaper to just buy caps and then look for good weapons at player vendors. you can buy 30k caps for like 4 dollars
---
I lock mine but dicks love to unlock it and rummage through it. Now im on a private server because I had 5 guys go through it in a 15 minute time frame.
---
Hey are you online? I'm on now.
---
This was exactly how I interpreted this post. Besides the point, PVP in this game IMO is lame in 76.  Unfair advantages make noobs feel like they are good at a game.
---
Awesome, thank you for your time and advice!
---
Outch..
---
10 mins eating dinner
---
Ah I have those then. I just don't associate any of the current outfits with the Free States people after seeing the atom shop clothes. The miner outfits do make sense tho. Hard working people being overrun by automation would certainly be at odds with the government.
---
I have a lvl 40 bloodied pipe revolver if you‚Äôre interested. I used a lvl 20 BE pipe revolver to level up real quick (20-40) this last 2xp weekend. Picked up 7 levels in just one lengthy queen battle with a small number of players.
---
Yeah, these are the issues I've been dealing with trying to develop it. That's actually why Im putting it out there now, maybe I'd get some valuable insight from other members.
---
I mostly just use it as a rough gauge when I have a gun that's not really a valuable trade, but not so terrible it's only worth scrip. I'm laid off right now, maybe I'll try to fully flesh it out haha
---
Pretty sure its to temp players to buy atoms right there and now to make that purchase cause they are shy on atoms and want it before it expires. 
---
Same reason milk is in the back of the stores.  To get u to make impulse buys.
---
Santa outfit+ sheepsquatch imposter hat
---
This is very in depth and exactly what i was looking for, thanks.
---
I was wondering if the purveyor was going to have a xmas sale!! Guess I know where my max scrip is going!
---
The other tidbits are interesting.  Pretty pumped for Wastelanders.
---
Equip a crossbow, use grenades&amp;throwing weapons to kill the scorched. It's faster and count as well. You just need to have your crossbow equipped.
---
ü§°
---
That's the core problem itself here, 76 was (obviously) never intended to be a fully fleshed-out game on it's own (hence the low investment from Bethesda) but rather meant as a 'side-project' to milk their customers while they develope the next 'projects' (which might turn out the same tbh...) so we have this unstable mess of a code that Bethesda couldn't care less about as long as their system of Atomshop money generation works.
---
There would be a way to teach them to invest something into the game by stopping to buy Atomshop stuff with money...but we all know how unlikely that is to happen given the group Bethesda is especially targeting with it for this.
---
Hopefully mystery pick isnt bugged this time around.
---
I will join when I get home!
---
There's a really old bug you might be experiencing. First, go to the Enclave Bunker and make sure you for sure already know the X-01 Jet Pack plan. Next, take off ALL of the Power Armor perks to see exactly how much of each material you need. Now make sure that you have MORE than the minimum of each material.
---
For example, if it says you need 5 Violet Flux and you have exactly 5.... Get 1 more. Once you have all of the minimum requirements +1, put your power armor crafting perks back on and try again.
---
Why is this 40 minutes long
---
No wonder my legendary, scrip-worth stuff flies (er, when it does, more on that in a second). List all of that at 10/scrip. They're probably being resold but the whole point is to get rid of them, doesn't bother me much.
---
Oddly enough I get shit for foot traffic. Location location location they say but I'd prefer a nice view than more sales /shrug
---
Was playing last night and looks like they may have nerfed the spawning of xmas scorch ..
---
My Bloody Swing Speed Block Shovel jk. That's just my fave. I'd say my best would be the Bloody SS +1S Deathclaw Gauntlet.
---
That's exactly what I wanted them used for. I have so many outfits that I would love to display
---
Great :)
---
Posted the link on Facebook as well but awaiting approval from the mods in the group. Hopefully we can gather a few people from different time zones.
---
Also check and see if it ended up as a blueprint combined with another structure or object. If moving camo without storing stuff, it automatically combined things for you to out down completed structures next time. Your santatron may be hiding in one of those. Go to the stored tab, and make sure you've broken down all those blueprinted structures.
---
Yeah cool I‚Äôm from London, but I deleted my Facebook so can‚Äôt see the community!
---
That's so neat I didn't know that.
---
Some of us liked building defensive camps and fighting. Luring other pvpers over to my murder camp and seeing it in action. What's the point of all the defensive stuff now? Turrets to kill molerats? What a waste.
---
All over a bunch of scrap. That never really runs out because the wasteland is full of it. And now you can store an infinite amount of it and fix everything with a single click.
---
This
---
Did they give more resources back then?
---
This seems to happen with my BFFR Plasma Rifle frequently, it has the Flamer barrel and 500 rounds is Awesome to say the least, but I quickly run out of plasma cartridges and have to put it away for a while again, it has also happened a couple of times with a 50 Cal, but unfortunately never with my LMG.
---
Just remember that what I have is subjective, and it's just a starting point! You really have to spend time on the trading sub to get a good feel of what items go for. I've been trading on there since the game released, and I'm still uninformed when it comes to a lot of values. 
---
The other person who responded to me has some good points about the values of items
---
Where do you get the presents from?  Sorry I‚Äôm still a bit new to the game ( 2 months) but I never seen any presents and I have kept santatron running since I got him a few days ago.
---
Trading posts are no longer allowed on /r/fo76. There are a multitude of trading subreddits available - please submit to a trading subreddit of your choice instead. If your post is not about making a trade, please message the subreddit moderators using the link at the end of this message and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
I hope we'll know what happened to Duchess in Welch, what happened to Butch, and what forced them to move instead of defending Welch.
---
Before I say anything, a lot of us reading this feel your pain, it sucks to be taken advantage of, but you're going about this in a weird way that's offputting.
---
Trying to dictate morality is self defeating and it's a bad look.  Being self righteous is no way to get people on your side.  Do good things because it's the right thing to do and because you enjoy it.  And don't let people drag you down when they don't share similar morals.  When you post salty stuff like this it really sullies the good you're trying to do.
---
Survival Mode was super fun as a low level! I found plenty of other low levels to PvP with, they were some fun fights. Then some high levels come and everyone disperses - really fun cat and mouse.
---
To be honest, I don't think bethesda know what they are doing at this point. That's how bad ideas get off the ground floor instead of being shot back down. To continue to make more content they had to find a way to supplement the income. They introduce the FO1st program, thinking it's going to shore up any potential gaps in revenue and to convince the publisher to allow them to support the title. 
---
While the features of FO1st looks great on paper, the execution is depressing. They could make far more in revenue if they continued to fill out the atom shop at more reasonable prices.
---
If they instead had integrated the FO1st features into the games over all structure instead of putting it behind a price wall, people may be more receptive to buying cash shop items more often. As long as items in the shop were priced reasonably. You still make your money, it doesn't look like you're bending your community over the barrel, and animosity doesn't generate from within the community towards the general population of the community. 
---
But what do I know!?
---
You can get presents from Santa Scorched and from Wrapping Paper, which is sold by vendors. Then you can craft gifts at a Tinkers Bench.  Equip Chemist to get double yield.
---
I have to disagree with this just because people can spend their money on what they like you know? My mom spends money on...purses which to me, a girl who keeps things in her damn pockets, is a waste of money. But they make her happy. I, on the other hand, like taxidermy. And she thinks it's stupid to spend money on a dead animal but I like taxidermy so I'm going to keep doing it. We also get into arguments because I am an artist however I still buy art from other artists. Because I like their art-  even tho I can make art myself - I still want to support others. Same applies to fallout imo. If it's something you like and you want to spend money on it - then do it. The real tree is dead and will be thrown away in a couple weeks. The digital tree will exist for the near future.
---
That can go on pretty far fallout 76 is just a fallout 4 mod which is just a Skyrim mod which is just a fallout 3 mod which is just an Oblivion mod which is just a Morrowind mod.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Also I'd love the purveyor to move north of Welch train station, in the coffee shop with Murgle the cat.
---
Save your atoms my man... I never impulse buy UNLESS it is on sale or limited for a GOOD PRICE. Im sitting on 2500 atoms and average about 50 a day. Not too difficult.
---
Doesn't the Duchess look a bit young to have been away for 25 years?
---
Tyvm
---
Maybe instead of telling us - tell them. More likely to get your money that way.
---
Tried running one about a week ago, and the guy with the key needed to complete  the mission blue screened.  So in my experience it's still bad.
---
Your default carry weight without power armor is 265 because you likely have 15 Strength and the Strong Back perk. When you put the Excavator power armor on, you're getting boosted to 365 because the Excavator +100 carry weight buff is working as intended.
---
There is also a bug that gives you an extra +100 carry weight, which would bring you up to 465. This bug only lasts until you get killed.
---
In short, you're getting the buff. Your complaint is that the unintended bug isn't working reliably. Add the Motion Assist mod to the torso and Calibrated Shocks to the legs to get an extra 110 carry weight.
---
Wow the rest of the decade no more ITV.. Hope they do pick it up in the first two weeks of the new decade.
---
When it's trash legendary, I scrap. If it's a good but low level legendary, I put it around 100 and 500 depending of the stars. If it's a good max level I go for 500 per star, when you're at maxlevel, it's easier to farm caps than finding the right legendary.
---
Okay so just figured out that this fucking game messes with my internet in itself, whenever my internet hits a low low point it changes my friends list to say i have no internet disconnecting me from everything, especially 76. It does this every time i play fallout 76, no other game, so honestly now im just not gonna play this game till wastelanders
---
I lock mine. 
---
People still pick the lock and take my presents though. 
---
PSA:  If you do not change the settings on santatron he may not get you presents. You have to go to the terminal and select "Christmas Gifts", or he will only give you scrap and junk (whatever setting you had it on previously)
---
I got one last night, finally. It's insane how hard it is to get some of these plans.
---
It is the primary reason I have fallout 1st, those "private servers" are very stable compared to anything else.
---
Not a bug, it's a kids in the hall skit called New York Road Trip.
---
"That not a deer, that's a bear!"
---
Online now
---
A friend and I just picked a lock at each other‚Äôs camp. Instant wanted.
---
yup, the latency on public worlds is still the big raid killer. but that's a server issue as a whole and not just raid, raids just get hurt the worst.
---
&gt; Do private servers help cut down on the lag?
---
yes they do, but there is an occasional problem where after x time passes in the p.server, the server will act like the mission is changing and wont let you in. (fixed with a game restart, or hopping to a public)
---
my public world tips:
---
-  squad in main then join a server, normally you get put into an ok one.
---
-make sure there are no nukes being worked on/dropped
---
-use the silo holotape in my pipboy to test "terminal" speed
---
She does. In the French voice acting, she's sounds like a mature woman on the holotapes. To me it was obvious she was going to return as a ghoul but nah. Also you can still find bodies of pre-bomb soldier still intact, so who knows :/ maybe they'll twist the story a little.
---
There are a few really easy ways to start PVP.
---
First, and the easiest is to take a highly contested workshop.  Hemlock, Munitions, Posiedon, Grafton.  The PVPers will come.
---
The other way is to get a tesla rifle.  Make sure pacifist is off.  Head to Scorched Earth, and leave the event.   Shoot at people, someone will have forgotten to turn off Pacifist, and PVP will start.
---
I‚Äôm not a hundred percent sure but I think the responders paint is coming after Christmas.
---
Stranger PA doesn't do poison damage. It does acid damage.
---
Welcome! Welcome to the super jump! I was very envious of that until I finally got it.  Now: Make sure you have Starched Genes 2+ under Luck equipped so you don‚Äôt lose your mutations when you take Radaway!
---
The real MVP
---
I do this event every day. 
---
Canned meat stew is life.
---
It's still around, and still pops pretty regularly.
---
I really want the raider machine but idk if i can get it yet
---
You need to a good public server or private server to do expert on any of the raids. The performance is much better compared to launch but if you are in a public server (which i wouldnt recommend), you will still notice delays that are 3 to 10 seconds long, they just arent completely stupid 3 minute delays anymore
---
Meh
---
Probably just bored with the game or wanting to flex on other players.
---
I got bored with FO4 so I downloaded the cheat room mod and had fun screwing around with all the different weapons in game, especially legendaries. It was pretty funny using a minigun that fired missiles and shit like that.
---
Obviously doing that in an MMO is a dick move, but there are tons of god mode and cheat mods for fallout games.
---
Reddit Rule #154 - If you mention getting down-voted in your topic, it will get down-voted. It is a strange place.
---
Now that you mention it, I have not seen feed the people pop up since patch 16 came out.  It definitely was still an event and at one point it would pop up constantly to the point that I would have 15 canned meat stews at one time.  I wonder if they tried to address it coming up too often and then borked it?
---
Has anyone else done it recently?
---
Yeah I forgot to type that, I have starched genes 2+.
---
It's still there, but you'll see less of it. In a previous patch the Public Event concept was introduced. Basically, many events are now in a pool with a shared cooldown and only one of them is active at a time. You can read more about this in this article when they were introduced: (note - there have been some tweaks in later patches, but the main concept is the same)
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/wRbFs3isUcOl1cZlp3ulb/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-public-events-preview
---
Positive. They patched the exploit. Highly doubt they missed a character, it seems it‚Äôd be pretty easy to be through with deleting them all
---
I had to lock mine for a while last night cause some turd sat at my base for 2 1/2 hours waiting for more gifts to be placed in it. I wouldn't have even really cared if he wasnt shooting anyone who came near the damned thing.  Takes all kinds.
---
thank ya ! Imma try this asap
---
I'm in the same boat. I also have a full set of lvl 25 raider power armor after running cliff view for a couple of days. I think Bethesda wants me to put more effort into leveling.
---
Bam there goes one!
---
Sometimes it's on the shelf in the Medical Wing.
---
Locked...its the only thing at my camp that is. Also, has anyone noticed, you get a ding whenever a present appears in it? I was wandering Whitesprings, nowhere near it, and I heard a Christmasy Ding. Went immediately back to my camp, and there was a present in there. Is that a thing, or was I hearing stuff?
---
Feed the people used to give e1 on server food when it was completed. Apparently that was a bug and was changed awhile back, such a bummer.
---
Legit thought it was a cool thing, feed the people givivg even those not participating food.
---
Damn it, take this up-vote.
---
I‚Äôm getting downvotes for troubling shooting a game lol. I‚Äôm trying to fix a game I like and I‚Äôm getting downvotes. Isn‚Äôt it the same as when people say if you don‚Äôt like fallout 76 don‚Äôt play? Well I do like it and I‚Äôm trying to play and I can‚Äôt and the community is pushing me away like a dysfunctional family rejects the sibling who says dad molested them üòÜ
---
It's actually a pretty dirty system designed to play off of FOMO and get people to spend real money.
---
If you know it's there you save up and buy it, if it comes and goes at odd periods then if you don't quite have enough you might be tempted to spend a little to make up the difference and buy it while you can. 
---
If you miss it then you may just buy something else that's kind of cool and start saving up again at which point they bring it back for a limited time to try and get you to spend real money to get it while it's there.
---
Every single item 'leaving the shop' has come back within 2 months. Watch and see: the vault stairs will be back by Feb.
---
You‚Äôre talking about the company that does coding so cheap and lazily that their own website backended private information to its own users. The same company that thought asking for a 500 word essay was a good punishment for hackers. The same company who‚Äôs primary team working on this are mtx specialists. The same team who ‚Äúfixed‚Äù 250 DR bugs. Do I really need to elaborate even more of the things this team has proven capable of?
---
I saw that, but it only showed up for raider armor for me.
---
That event pops almost every time I go to turn in Sierra bravo samples to the university.  Just pop down there and server hop a couple of times and it should come up for you.
---
The first set is from a random encounter where super mutants are fighting liberators, the second is from another random encounter where a sheepsquatch killed a pack of super mutants and leaves one alive. This one roams around passively and is named ‚Äúcrippled super mutant‚Äù
---
I seldom see it either

That just immediately struck me... but I am definitely pumped for Wastelanders.
---
This isn‚Äôt accurate, a qffr auto rifle is way better than any TSffr
---
Nice. Happy to see what Wastelanders will bring.
---
Hope that Flatwoods also get some people back (at least someone to replace the vendor bot there).
---
Can someone recognize where that second picture is?
---
So... You're on a PS4 Pro?
---
Weird.  Wonder why me and OP are never seeing it?  I miss having stew!!
---
Thanks all, u/scottduvall got it, stuck in previous blueprint
---
I was going to take out lower level scorched.
---
They could also make the unique weapons into something similar to The Fixer, as 4* legendarys.
---
Consider waiting for 2X xp, when the Halloween 2X xp ended, I was up 32 levels, from 48 to 80, then with the christmas xp, I jumped 15 levels, 80 to 95, now sitting at 96 due to the xmas rewards.
---
I hope not, because that is where I live now lol
---
From what a PVPer told me just prior to his death, legacy weapons are what you use if you want to be a **serious** PVPer.
---
For those not in the know, energy weapon explosions deal full energy damage meaning Fireproof and Dense do not work. They are essentially bugged. Serious PVPers use broken weapons.
---
I think my backwoods ass cable is only 3Mb/s, hasn't given me much issue. Far from ideal but ping if I'm not mistaken is more important, and from OP his seems to be reasonably quick.
---
I get it, I get it. It's a wip like I said, and there's kinks. I recommended to op not to follow it to the T and instead spend time on the trading sub, just use it as a starting point.
---
I'm not gonna sit and debate all the nuances of it because it's an incomplete work and the market is a complex, fluid thing.
---
I'm assuming PS4?
---
First, use a wired connection. Wireless is inherently unstable, especially if there are multiple devices and/or other wireless networks in range of yours.
---
Second, 41ms ping isn't absolutely terrible, but it's definitely not great either. Possibly something to do with the quality of your wireless connection, or the internet connection itself. 
---
Third, 32 down/2 up isn't fantastic either, because that's just showing the best possible connection under testing. A lot of other things affect actual connection speed. This game is constantly trying to sync with the server as you play, and a slow upload speed makes that difficult.
---
Last, how many people are on your friend list?
---
No a regular PS4 from 2016
---
Okay. Yeah if you've been contracted by ISPs you would know that the Windows command is ipconfig /release and ipconfig /renew. You'd also know it's ifconfig on any Linux-based distro.
---
Also you'd realize that only changes your internal IP address on your local network, not the dynamic IP address assigned to your modem that is your external IP address. The one that Bethesda sees. Jesus Christ I get downvoted into oblivion by a guy that claims to be contracted by ISPs when he doesn't even know what NAT is or how ipconfig works. Where do I post the screenshot of my CCAr cert?
---
I know a person who spawned stuff in, whether it affects internet or not, I don‚Äôt know, but there is at least 2 gigs of unused shit from 4 that will never be used, the prydwn just scratches the surface.
---
It's a public event now, so it has to come up as part of the cycle.
---
Very very varied. If you just have scrip material, really depends; somewhere around 20-40 caps per scrip is standard. Popular effects depend far more on the item than anything else. A 1* bloodied rolling pin would sell for 300 or so caps, a 1* bloodied handmade rifle will sell for 5-8k. There is no formula for it, you just need to have enough experience to derive a rough approximation of value and be able to guesstimate based on relative value. Such as, this two shot explosive combat rifle is worth less than the bloodied explosive handmade, but more than the two shot single action revolver
---
Actually, quite the opposite.
---
I‚Äôve been selling all my excess legendaries at 30 caps per scrip, but with the current event (flooding my stash) I‚Äôve dropped to 25 and my go to 20. I regularly sell lots of inventory and my caps keep flowing. 
---
Here‚Äôs how my system works‚Äîuse what you like, or totally ignore it, you do you. 
---
1. Will I use this weapon I just got/found? If yes, then I keep it. If no, then I‚Äôll either scrip or sell it. 
---
2. If it‚Äôs got a desirable (and appropriate to the weapon) effect on it; Two shot, Bloodied, Anti Armor, Furious, faster fire rate, explosive, faster swing speed etc, then it goes in my vending machine for 25 caps per scrip. No, I don‚Äôt care how much it can get on Reddit, FB or eBay. I won‚Äôt use it, therefore it is worthless to me, so I‚Äôll happily let someone else get it for cheap. I lack the patience to make trades with people outside of the game. 
---
3. If the primary effect is garbage; Nocturnal, Berserkers, Stalker‚Äôs etc., and there is no great secondary or tertiary effect, then it gets thrown in the chipper for scrip. Most items fall into this category. 
---
4. If I have space in the vendor and I‚Äôve already collected my daily scrip, I‚Äôll often throw junk weapons in at the same 25 caps per scrip. But, they‚Äôll be pulled out and turned in as soon as possible. Sometimes players need a couple of items to max out their scrip for the day and some cheap one star nocturnal wood legs will do the job.
---
But my favourite camp is setup there! :P
---
If they do that they'll have to give us kitten pets to make up for it. ;)
---
Yup 96 here, it gets worse as you go
---
I am not liking the sound of wastelanders... it sounds like you really need to start a new character to feel cohesive and have a natural way of experiencing the new additions. That‚Äôs fine and all, but I feel like my existing character will be out of place a little. Maybe it‚Äôs just me.
---
Just saying, after the nerf TS is now a really bad effect. It‚Äôs a 40% damage bonus if both shots hit, if not, it‚Äôs just a normal weapon that has no damage bonuses.
---
Yeah, they updated it to make it a better dungeon.
---
Also, there is a Small Backpack blueprint inside the Overseer cache there now. 
---
You should get it (you cannot use a Backpack skin from Atom Shop on it though).
---
I reckon its on the edge of or near Flatwoods
---
You are getting downvotes because aperently it matters to you... just that.
---
That's nice. Are the exploits and bugs fixed yet? No? Well then call us when they are, Bethesda.
---
Paying money for rewards in a video game, haha. 
---
\*looks at atom shop decor\*
---
\*sighs\*
---
I have and they just keep trying to get me to trouble shoot the game. I game here to see if anyone knows more than they do because I‚Äôve done everything they suggested and some suggestions from here. Whatever it is this update broke the game for me, I even uninstalled it and downloaded it again and it was a blue screen under 10 minutes into the game.
---
Drop them in suitcases at train stations (lot of people use Whitesprings station) or the overseers camp, or the area around the vault.
---
Artificial scarcity and limited time stuff consistently leads to more sales. Perhaps Fallout 76 is the exception to this otherwise quite common phenomena, but considering they keep doing it I doubt their internal data reflects that 
---
It is shitty but so many places do this type of thing (mostly through sales) because it is so effective
---
Yikes. My cell phone has 10mbps upload hah. Like I said I am not an expert here, just seemed low
---
Unlink and relink your Bethesda account.
---
we completed expert on all 3 types before private worlds where in the game.. here are my tips for finding a good public world.
---
#1 Water test. collect 15 water from a water source fast. once you collect it check and see if you have 15. if not go to a new world.
---
#2 check the nuke holo to see if there are any nuke's and to see how fast it comes up.
---
#3 how fast does your camp spawn in.
---
that's it. it can take a few server hops to find one but it can be done.
---
Yeah, I'm aware of that but it should show up once in a while it seems.  Guess I just don't play long enough for it to ever come around.  Seems like I would catch it occasionally but I  guess not.
---
I was ok with the tiered release schedule of holiday items, but I agree that pulling Christmas items from the shop *before Christmas even happened* is pretty shitty of them.
---
Is it possible to have another player build the lights for you? I know this can be done with regular in-game stuff, but have never tried with atom shop decor.
---
I don't buy from salesmen that come to my door IRL, I won't do it in game either.
---
You'd be surprised how much of an issue it is. Lots of textures are re-used underground, there's clipping, and you have to add thickness to things - it's not just a matter of coloring it white. Think of a fire hydrant. Snow piles up in a very specific manner due to the shape. You'd have to observe that and model it accordingly Now consider all the places there are fire hydrants, and how the surroundings would change the snow. If there's a roof or some covering, it might not get snow on it. There are tons of reused assets / textures that are the same underground as they are above ground or in buildings / outside. You'd have to not only make new versions of those, but then specify where they go. I honestly think it would be easier to make a new area from scratch in many cases.
---
It will, and it will show up om screen like all the other public events. I'm not a huge fan of the public event system and the events they decided to add, but it does function as intended atleast. It's also a good way to fast travel for free.
---
Wastelanders will be so fail. I am predicting early game content to hook some new players to buy atoms, the new endgame will be 5 star legendary items and another fail vault.
---
Some games have terribly narrow-sighted and/or inexperienced people running their cash shops. Another game I played until it shut down last year was the same thing. Relentlessly poor decisions concerning the cash shop; and we later discovered it was being run, at least in part, by one of the game's former PVP devs.
---
You never really know who helms these debacles.
---
Pack Rat; Long Shot; Adamantium Skeleton; Weapon Artisan; Ammo Smith; Luck of the Draw; dude, that's a food build. Some of those perks are okay for your side deck, but do yourself a favor and ditch them from your main deck. The ones you need are Master Rifleman, Fireproof, Nerd Rage, etc. And maybe also get the Adrenal Reaction mutation. Or do a Stealth Commando build, those are supposedly also good.
---
Yeah probably.
---
Behind my camp , because I planted them there
---
How the hell did you get that bricking and wood paneling? My house looks like a shack made with 4x4's.
---
Yup. Relogging fixes it for me though.
---
I did forget to say which were in the side deck - basically anything crafting would be in the side deck and just swapped in when necessary
---
Are the wreath and presents all from NW? :O
---
Console testing might be expensive, not sure what Sony and Microsoft would charge them.  PC makes sense at least since there's no charges for patches through their own launcher.  As a PS4 player, I would live test servers for my platform ( and Xbox of course ).  But I'd settle for PC only.
---
Nah, just take off all your perks/gear, and run along with all the other low levels. Depending on how this works out, it's what I plan on doing.
---
Yeah 4G is impressive. This S7 will get around the same upload as you using Verizon. Can only imagine what 5G will offer.
---
Where I'm up here in the far northern parts of California were just getting fiber installed, and my cable company only started offering 100Mb/s down this summer.
---
Sucks :p
---
Yea PS4 sorry. Friends list? Probably a lot, I remember that was an issue a while ago. What I don‚Äôt understand is the game seems to be working worse since I got better internet. What I have now isn‚Äôt the best but I was using a public hotspot for a year and the game wasn‚Äôt even like this. There are things I could improve like you said but could an update really break a game like this even when it worked fine previously under worse conditions? Maybe time to get a new system? Switch to Xbox? Get gaming specific internet packages? I‚Äôve honestly never had anything remotely close to this much trouble with the game, I‚Äôve always been the one telling people it‚Äôs not as bad as people say, and I‚Äôm. It having any issues with anything else connected to WiFi. No game or app or anything is having issues. Now I understand their frustration. You just want to play a game you like and paid for and can‚Äôt ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Post history suggests no actual playing experience with Fallout 76, and in fact the account was created around the same timestamp as the Wiener_Almagam_Space account.  All evidence suggests a troll.

Can confirm. Its definitely aids.
---
50 poison resist cuts the poison damage in half which is a big difference...
---
I hope the Overseer is added with the Wastelanders update. I wonder what happened to her, I want to finish the side quest, since it‚Äôs been in my Quest log since launch.
---
Isn't that near the Donut place?
---
Oh sorry didn't see your message what's your GT?
---
Bethesda is notorious for reusing faces in their games. It is likely the same face mesh presets.
---
[](/flutterroll)
---
Well if you test it, poison resist decreases the acid damage from strangler
---
Really dont like how a whole new building can spring up overnight.  They do weekly updates it would have been nice if these settlers gradually built things up around them.
---
Well if i could find a 4th piece that‚Äôs auto stim with poison resistance, I‚Äôd love to test. At 3 pieces, it‚Äôs barely noticeable.
---
I think he meant console commands, to spawn items into the game

---
It‚Äôs confusing to me and the upvote downvote system obviously does something. I don‚Äôt use Reddit much and I got 4 downvotes on another post legit just asking for help.
---
Seems silly to have to simulate working your way through the wasteland. I‚Äôm just going to start a new character.
---
I snapped a stairs to a foundation and then a half floor and stairs down, then snapped a foundation to the stairs
---
Built up a chimney breast using doorways
---
moved the foundation they were stacked on and replaced the doorways with walls
---
Downvoted for the truth obviously. Lol this sub.
---
I already have all 5 slots taken on my main account :(
---
Thank you !
---
Ok so are you ready with your low level character? Also, which one has the peepers? The low level or higher level?
---
Lol I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre getting crap for this.
---
Believe it or not, some people don‚Äôt want to spend every day farming caps. I often log in for 5 minutes a day just to sell serums and scrip legendaries.
---
I wish you remembered their gametag. Ive been going broke trying to get one for my friend.
---
Yeah, I found that out the hard way, took putting a post on here to find that out after raging about it for like 20 mins lol
---
I dont care at all and have 2K,they are worth nothing
---
I look at it the other way, I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs mostly designed with current players in mind. They‚Äôd need to change the starting sequence though, to explain why some people are still coming out of the vault a year later, the timeline is definitely getting fucky. I kind of wish they had a different intro all along, maybe for the first few months have it be ‚Äúreclamation day‚Äù but at this point, and especially with Wastelanders pushing time forward, it makes absolutely no sense that everyone is still having the same intro. And how will the intro to WL differ for new players compared to current players?

---
Well. I have 0 problems ever on a regular first gen PS4. So I'll just tell you what I do to achieve that and you can take what advice you need from it? Best way I can think of to help.
---
1) I have AT&amp;T Uverse, with the highest internet available in my area. 300 up/down on paper, actually runs about 275 up and 150 down typically.
---
2) I have a wired connection run straight to my console.
---
3) I keep my friend list below 30 people total. The reason this is an issue is every 5 minutes the game syncs with the server, and for some reason syncing the friends list really bogs down the process. Not sure on the specifics, but when I had 140 friends from all the trading I used to do, I would get the same problems; game seizing and crashing, lag, ping etc. Went through and removed everyone that I never actually played with, and boom. Instantly better.
---
4) Once a day I power cycle my PS4, launch in safe mode and rebuild the database. I also always shut it down completely when I'm done for the day. Yes, it makes downloading patches a but more cumbersome, but my system runs better for it, so totally worth it.
---
5) I reset my cable modem approximately once a week.
---
I have 0 of the problems with stability everyone else talks about. Hell, minecraft gives me more problems than Fallout 76 does at this point.
---
I reserved one just in case! That‚Äôs a bummer
---
Yes so many lately with all the ass hats keep picking my santatron üò§
---
Lol ok that‚Äôs good to know then, I thought it would somehow rank you in posts or something
---
They don't give half a shit to even change the faces a bit lol
---
Any two shot? For a single star that is pricy.
---
I'm in the same boat with the antlers. I used my atoms to buy a couple pricey outfits that I really wanted and was going to do challenges to push me over the last hundred or so I need to get those, but alas they are already gone. I understand the rationale behind limited stuff but it seems really stupid to have the Christmas stuff go away before Christmas is even here.
---
I just tested it I don't think you can,  I kept server hoping and kept seeing the same clothes in a spot then after I took it and kept server hoping it stayed gone
---
Your post history suggests Todd's personal sucker though
---
*glurp glurp*
---
Thanks for the advice. I‚Äôll have to try a wired connection and removing a lot of friends.
---
I see "next year" and "2020" but for some strange reason the word "early" or "Q1" is missing when describing the timeframe again.
---
It will fail, that's guaranteed. This is Bethesda after all. The real question is if they will stop supporting the game after that.
---
I'm on PS4 and haven't had a single crash these past updates, just to give a different perspective.
---
Problem is that a lot of people who play fallout only play fallout, this has been going on since phantasty star online for the dreamcast, people even paid real money for runescape items.
---
Wastelanders is canonically a year after the vault opens. The in game date on your pip-boy doesn't change so the time the current story of 76 takes could be anywhere from a day to a year. It's a sort of time-jump situation, so any new building could have taken months to build. 
---
It may be jarring and I'd have loved more hints of locations appearing, but I hope this information helps it feel less strange
---
they might as well use paint 3D to add snow on ps4
---
Thus why I said they should just have retextured existing gear
---
You're a sad pseudo gamer*
---
They could copy a backup of the textures, using the same file name, and edit the landscape textures to look like snow. In creation kit it‚Äôs really not as crazy as one would think when you literally just paint on the texture to a landscape. If they edit the grass texture they would have to retexture every inch. Even the rocks, FO4 CK only had maybe 25~ rock models. I don‚Äôt really care for the snow, it‚Äôd be cool either way, just thought I‚Äôd say what I thought.
---
You are confusing memory (ram) with storage
---
Just write a full sentence in your title and it won‚Äôt be deleted. It‚Äôs not that difficult.
---
Had mine too on ps4, nice spot
---
Seems like you have tried most thing, are you connected directly to your router or using powerline adapters etc? I'm on a ps pro and experience fair number of blue screens crashes 57 to be exact in the last 6-7 months. It's a good game but at times a complete buggy mess. You will be downvoted because you dare to speak critically of the game which always attracts the brand ambassadors =shills for Bethesda. Hopefully you find a sollution.
---
My 3 best are TSE Gat Plasma.   B25AGI Gat Plas.  BE25 Lever.
---
I‚Äôd love a grinch outfit! My goof ass jacked around 50 presents last night from Santatrons lmao
---
The part I feel like they mess up on this especially is with CAMP items. I don't build every time I play, so I'm not building weekly. When I do build, I go ham in the Atomic Shop with stuff that'll spruce up my house and look cool, so it blows to see things constantly coming/going. I end up just buying a lot less.
---
I will never understand for the life of me why people sell their serums for such a low price...like that shit is so f*cking annoying to farm it's unreal. I stockpile every single serum I make so that **I** can help myself reach my daily cap limit, every day, for a very long time, rather than somebody else.
---
Thank you for coming to my TED talk...
---
It's Christmas. If less fortunate players than me feel the need to steal my Christmas presents, then they are welcome to them. They obviously need them more than I do. ;)
---
How is 4800= $48? If you are buying that many atoms why wouldnt you buy a bundle to lower he price?specifically why wouldn‚Äôt you get fallout 1st so you get twice that many atoms per dollar?
---
This. Honestly, a lot of the problems I see people having, regardless of which game or platform, is due to either hardware not being up to snuff, or the internet quality. If you're trying to use DSL to game, while your neighbor leeches it for porn and Netflix, you're going to have a bad time.
---
TURNKEY!!! MOOOOORD!
---
Indeed, I got 10 out of mine in the span of an hour of play time.
---
No worries. It's nice to see someone actually trying to fix their issues instead of just yelling it's just shoddy programming.
---
Yeah the key was finding the switch. I‚Äôve been twice in the asylum now and the door with the red button has always been open. So I was lost in the building. Then finding the note was another task, there are just no quest markers in the building which makes it difficult to find these little things in dark spots. Now I‚Äôm good, what a relief. Next step is the Capitol, will see if the terminal works now. The quests have closed and opened correctly so far.
---
Like early Spawn?
---
I'm not saying anyone is buying that many Atoms. I'm not saying you shouldn't buy bundles or Fallout 1st. I'm only stating that numerically 100 Atoms is equivalent to $1 at base value.
---
Certain cloth spots will always spawn the item but some places cycle through a couple of them.
---
My ingame name is Gucci667
---
Not true. Fireproof was reduced to 15% per star, Licensed Plumber got the same reduction as White Knight, I'm pretty sure there was something else, but I can't remember everything.
---
Well,  it looks like the hot fix didn't work or they found another script to bypass what Bethesda did.
---
Sounds good!   I'll be on later tonight, and will make sure to add you!  What level are you now?  I'll try and bring you some appropriate gear!
---
It says in the article that it is located just down the road from the Overseer's Camp on the way to Flatwoods.
---
If you farm super mutants and know where cap stashes are you can! :)
---
Seriously though, idk if you could rush the encryptid quest before level 20-30, even with good tier weapons and armor.
---
If you ABSOLUTELY want to try though, run either a full set of Vanguard armor with a vampire weapon (godmode the legitimate way) or run bolstering and a bloody weapon (same DR, so hard to kill, plus the damage you need to take out things that are higher level)
---
Obviously PC. #ConsoleMasterRace
---
I must thank you as well!
---
It's right near the covered bridge and the overseer's camp, heading north towards the Slocum Joe's instead of south towards Flatwoods.
---
No thank you. People would most definitely find a way to exploit this.
---
Depends on my available stash space. I hold on to some stuff I will never sell like survival legacy rewards (unique named legendaries) and I have backup weapons, and weapons I'm working on, then the remaining stash space goes for stuff that is OK that I'm selling for fair amount. All of my prices depend on remaining stash space, if I need more space then I will lower my prices. I'm not too hard up on caps and would prefer people use the stuff I find and put into my shop. I price things high enough that someone isn't going to just buy it for scrip, but low enough that someone would say hey I could use that! Ive even sold single star wood armors.
---
Do you want to actually sell it or just have it sit in your stash and collect dust? 
---
Primary and secondary effects are all about combinations and quite honestly supply and demand and rarity.  Bottom line not everything is created equal. 
---
The best and most sought after primary effect is bloodied.  The next most desirable (in no order) are AA, quad, Vampire, and Furious. 
---
As for secondary effects, on non melee FFR is the best followed by vats reduction and probably explosive.  Melee is all about swing speed. 
---
In addition, the mods on weapons can have a significant impact on and value and use of said weapon.  Any automatic receiver will dramatically add to the value of the weapon.  
---
Weapon types matter too.  You have some god tier examples like Gatling explosive plasmas or lasers, the infamous FFR auto Tesla, but the commando build is hot as auto rifles cut across so many categories and you can maximize fire rate and damage.  Fixers, combat rifles, and obviously handmades are in high demand.
---
Yeah they were careful to avoid any specific or even general hint as to when to expect the expansion.
---
How should I issue a bug report?
---
Build four walls around the Santatron, I know this isn't the ideal look, but at least you can just go into build mode, move the wall and get your stuff when you need it.  Unfortunate that you might have to do that to prevent the sticky finger dbags from stealing your stuff.
---
I don't understand why some work and some don't. For clothing, I can display folded tattered dress, but not anything else that I've seen. On the other hand, I can display nearly any heardgear in the game, but not the White Wolf Fedora for some reason. There's no consistency at all.
---
Bethesda, let me display the things I have. That's kind of the point of the cabinets, right?
---
My bad, I meant the third one.
---
New fallout 1st content
---
Yeah, if we didn't have to use the door trick to put two walls on each other, it would free up a lot of budget.
---
I made a mistake, meant the third one.
---
I think that's the inside of the bar. They said it was an instanced location I think? So that's my guess.
---
i got 2 or three. but i leave it unlocked. its undergrounds so ...
---
Iv noticed junk items are also server hop but waiting a while like about an hour then can pick it up again
---
Yea you don‚Äôt get things accomplished that way. I understand the game engine is old and this is an experiment more than anything and meant to be fun. Up until now fallout4 was far far worse as far as blue screen crashes, FO76 hasn‚Äôt been that bad for me. What this reminds me of is when I had a lot of mods on fallout 4 that weren‚Äôt ordered correctly...the game kept blue screening.
---
Honestly this shouldn't even be possible. I'm all about supporting Betheada and their first foray into online gaming with the Fallout franchise, but anything that alters anything other than the UI should automatically prevent you from.connecting to the server, just like most other online games do.
---
Conspiracy theory: they recently have been pushed to provide mod support. Doesn't the recent string of issues give then the perfect excuse to NOT allow independent mod support?
---
I am just too stupid lmao.
---
I want to know about the picture where there settlers working a machine.
---
Same. I put the DNA sample in and got no reward of any kind
---
junkies/power armor/heavy weapons imo is the easiest way to be very good in pve
---
you can tank a lot of damage, the pa is easy to aquire and you only have to spare caps for one single good item (junkies explosive 50 cal for example)
---
It's how many other world spawns you pick up that affects it. The magic number seems to be 200 before items start to respawn.
---
They‚Äôre not loaded into the game (your ram) until needed so no.  They are just taking up space on your hard drive.
---
If you shoot a wanted do you have to change from pacifist first
---
I know right! Its one of my favorite weapons in the Fallout universe and burning bad guys is so much fun. I had received the Perfect Storm from a present the other day and was like 10mm bullets can catch an enemy on fire but yet the enemies are fire retardant to the shishkebab.

Now take your bullshit purity test, turn it sideways, and kindly shove it up your own ass.
---
Ah. That's Spruce Knob.
---
Im level 15 but i have 2 characters ive been trying to build a base but for the love of god i cant find much  wood haha
---
Ooohhhh!!! Is that Spruce Knob? It sort of looks like it.
---
Mod support will be for private servers. I imagine the mods will be bought from th AS too. I guarantee there won't be independent mods like we see for skyrim or fo4.
---
Definitely Spruce Knob
---
I don't expect independent mods either, but they have been asked for repeatedly and all these issues with the hacking really just gives them a perfect excuse not to. They would also explain why they haven't been very proactive and stopping at, because allowing it to become a significant issue gives them a reason to just nix the whole thing.
---
The only thing I have left to try is a wired connection and deleting friends from my friends list. Up until this patch I can honestly say I‚Äôve seen like, 5 blue screen crashes in a year, the game has had bugs but it‚Äôs always worked. I‚Äôve practically been a brand ambassador for this game, I even started an Instagram to post pictures when I‚Äôm bored at work. I love FO76 which is why I‚Äôm so frustrated that I can‚Äôt even play it anymore. Thanks tho.
---
Command Console, like when you enable cheats for minecraft. Kinda like the Command Prompt or cmd.exe for windows, but more for bug testing.
---
It lets you enter codes to do different things like spawn weapons/armor/mobs or change the time of day/weather.
---
lol.. I was salivating reading his post and pricing method, where is his CAMP???
---
Yeah I agree, I still have issues with fall out for. I have to go through a really lengthy cumbersome process just to be able to play the game with a couple mods or creation club content. As far as the engine, everyone keeps saying it's old. The concept of the creation engine is old but they update it every time they make a new game so the engine itself is actually new and updated. The concept of the engine is old.
---
This is because these developers have a bad habit of bait and switching this community.
---
Isn‚Äôt that spruce knob in the background?
---
Ikr it boggles my mind how many posts are jut asking for more microtransactions for stuff we should be able to get in game. There shouldn't be such a lopsided amount of content to get only available in the store. Its just such lame design.
---
Unfortunately this game is being used to test microtransaction strategies for future Bethesda products.  :/
---
Abusing people with mental illnesses they can't help. For shame Bethesda, for shame.
---
That is not good content. That just isnt at al.
---
I don't think they need much internal justification to charge for mods and I don't expect the player base to kick up too much fuss if they are limited to 1st subscribers. The moment I saw how they were rolling out temporary private servers I knew we would never get mods like a traditional Beth game.
---
My berserker cries when you call its effect garbage üò≠
---
Though to be fair, it is hard to find 3* zerker gear that has complimentary effects on it. üôÑ
---
I've seen camps where it looks like people are doing something similar.  I've picked up a few *decent* items for pretty reasonable prices like that (nobody ever looks at zealot's or hunter's weapons, even though they're really decent SBQ items with the right additional effects).
---
But no, I Haven't yet found any god tier weapons for those prices.
---
I've just blue screened twice since the PS4 system update. Giving it a third go.
---
Absolute legend it worked ! Thanks man :D
---
I thought that might have something to do with it but wasn‚Äôt 100% sure
---
You are correct, I have 2 main characters that I play, a full health Vanguard's Stealth Rifleman, and a Bloodied Stealth Rifleman.
---
My IE Handmade does more damage on the 1st shot than my BE Handmade, but I also have more invested in Rifleman perks on that character, that I have to use in Endurance for my Bloodied Build.
---
On my full health character I switch to Anti-Armor or Furious weapons for sustained battles with high level enemies.
---
This is BS. This game doesn't have any bugs AT ALL. The employees at Bethesda graduated at the University of Phoenix which only accepts the most elite programmers in the world. Finding a bug in this game is like trying to find a shit particle in Walmart: Absolutely impossible.
---
the whole game would blow up i mean cmon look at it even right now.
---
I've met that guy.
---
I dunno about the Nuke Launching, but I've been to his CAMP, and he has some really cool stuff there, but I dunno for sure if I would be 100% throwing accusations about the hacking.  
---
According to him, he has the NPC's through an Pacify/Taming exploit, which while certainly not kosher, is not the same as hacking.  
---
The player is a fairly big trader from what I know of, and many of the items he has are gifts/trades from shady folks, but to my knowledge he has not personally hacked or visited the Dev Room.  
---
He has no 'underground' base per-se, but rather uses the 'hole' in the map glitch to build his camp in existing terrain.  While I toured his camp, I never saw a launch terminal, though I saw a LOT of stuff that made me look sideways.

Again, I would not be 100% comfortable accusing him of hacks, because I have met a lot of traders that had 'secret' stuff that they got from the players that do hack, and those folks tend to keep a much lower profile on their accounts.  This is a case where it's easy to make a lot of assumptions, but without tangible proof, I don't feel like it'd be right to throw someone under the bus, or call them out here in the subreddit.
---
Also hoping this doesn‚Äôt happen, I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without my Schrodinger‚Äôs Murgle!
---
That's subjective.  I pointed out that you can earn the Atom Store items without ever buying Atoms for cash.  What you make of that is up to you.
---
They are generally frozen and not attacking, but I saw an Ant a few weeks ago during Scorched Earth that was Invincible and attacking everyone, it was hilarious because it seemed to be picking on one guy (level 80ish) and it was kicking his butt.
---
My rewards haven't been popping up for it either, but I am able to fast travel from there.
---
You make me wet.
---
I know a place you can get to, pretty danger-free especially if you fast-travel, where you can easily get between 300-500 wood in a single visit.
---
Yeah, whatever it is. There is a lot of it wasted.
---
Keep contacting support - they are able to restore and have done it for others.

I don't think we'll get any mods in a traditional sense. They couldn't add any actual gameplay as mods without backing out of the last commitment they haven't broken for this game. I don't think they would do that. Although even if they did it wouldn't be the end of the game, not by a long shot. Imho they should have never made those promises. Now people expect it, where they could have just gone forward with normal expectations from the beginning and people would have been happier and more appreciative of the free stuff. I'm not sure who is in charge of marketing and PR for this game, but they aren't very good at it.
---
Wow
---
That‚Äôs horrible
---
I wonder why they even allow people to submit tickets underneath the missing item subject if they can‚Äôt even help
---
I've been having a similar problem with daily quests. The rewards show up in my inventory, but I don't get an onscreen notification that the quest has been completed. I can't tell if I'm getting the XP or not.
---
You are stating 4800=$48. Which if does not unless you intentionally bought the most expensive atom bundle you could.
---
That's basically what the mods OP mentioned do, and they're *never* as cohesive as the original art direction. You edit one texture (especially drastically, like making it snowy) you have to make sure it still looks good in every context the original was used.
---
Nice!
---
I‚Äôm so beyond excited for Wastelanders!! I can‚Äôt WAIT to see how Appalachia evolves and meet all the cool new charactees
---
This. Support is your only recourse. Just be patient and polite, they are typically good about fixing stuff like this.
---
That being said, most here on Reddit are going to be very skeptical of anyone asking for help "starting over". There have been way too many instances of people saying that just to get handouts from other players. Sure, this is a nice community, but we don't take kindly to being scammed.

---
this is an amazing set up!
---
Then my mission is accomplished
---
If I had gold you‚Äôd be the rich one. &lt;3
---
Honestly I think that might be looking into it a little too much, they probably don‚Äôt feel the need to specify ‚Äòearly‚Äô or ‚ÄòQ1‚Äô since we already know thats when its coming. But I mean, I could be wrong.
---
hell no, for some odd reasonIi can hear people move while my game is still fading in, high-end pc, so no idea whats going on there.
---
Point being, i'm toast within 10 secs are fading in fully on these small maps.
---
depending on the spot, yes. as long as you dont pick it up, then you will have cooldown for that loot spot
---
The public testing server would most likely be a completely separate launch. You wouldn‚Äôt be able to carry saves between them, because it would be hard to make any progress. If they add the command console, it would allow for actual testing of whether X armor piece legendary effect gets broken by Y or such. This would allow for actual testing of the game‚Äôs bugs oppose to having to get all the stuff for testing legitimately. This could allow us to test exploits and bugs and report them directly to Bethesda. If we had to get all gear legitimately in a public testing server, this would lead to it failing really quickly due to the need to regain everything you have or getting the stuff you need to test bugs.
---
This is true. Don't downvote. They only removed 4*/5* gear. All other items spawned in are here to stay.
---
Welcome to the future of triple-A ~~video games~~ services.
---
at any time the thing does about 40 dmg without any perks
---
I missed out on the old modern one, was using the basic campfire in its stead while I waited for the modern one to return to the atomic shop
---
That Purveyor and Scrip machine from pictures sure as hell didn't get there as a "gift from shady folks". What he does is basically bannable offense.
---
&gt; The goal isn't quality content...
---
This should be their company motto. I have forsaken all interest in future ES and Fallout titles. If Bethesda closed it‚Äôs doors tomorrow, I‚Äôd just be happy that they didn‚Äôt get around to making everything worse.
---
You can't blame only Sony for that. Even previous FO76 updates didn't take so long to copy. It has to do with this specific update.
---
Took me 3 minutes to download this update, then AN HOUR to copy it ! And that's a fix of a fix of a previous buggy fix. Frustrating when you don't have a ton of time to play.
---
Again, other game updates don't take long to copy. Other FO76 updates, even the much larger ones, didn't take that long either. Has to do with this specific update.
---
Yeah, if this was added to the public testing servers, it would allow for normal players who can‚Äôt normally be on enough to test whether gear is OP or bugged and such. The console could allow us to balance gear accurately and report bugs easily.
---
How small we talking? Can fit on top of my table, or will stretch just barley from floor to ceiling?
---
Because there are people who think that Wastelanders was guaranteed to be released this past September.
---
Ok...let's see if I can break this down in the simplest way for you. I'm pretty sure you just wanting to argue or be an ass but here it is. If you buy 500 Atoms from the Atom shop it cost you $4.99...so pretty much what....$5.00....which equates to what???? 1 Atom per 1 cent or 100 Atoms per $1. 
---
The more you buy Yes you are given "Bonus" atoms and that can "lower" the cost but broken down to the smallest value it is $1 per 100 Atoms so 4800 Atoms would be equal to $48...NOT ENCLUDING the added bonuses.
---
It's so the hackers don't get the rewards on the first day. This way, they ruin games for the entire event and not just the first few days.
---
Sounds like mates defending mates. They are probably on a hacker discord laughing at these forums, us &amp; Bethesda right now.
---
I drop excess ammunition and cores in the train station containers. Known plans, maps, recipes, extra bobbleheads, and magazines are sold at my CAMP vendor for 0 - 1 cap. At my CAMP every shopper is a possible winner and I'm still at the max cap limit. Happy holidays all, particularly my fellow filthy casuals.
---
Oh wow thanks
---
I'm guessing the rug glitch works as well? (Putting the fireplace on a rug and then picking up the rug to move the fireplace.)
---
That‚Äôs because they know something you didn‚Äôt. I made a post about this earlier (it‚Äôs was muted not removed. I assumed the developers would have done something about it but four months later, nothing... CTR + TAB and then escape when the screen is black gets you in early. Had nothing to do with the map size. You‚Äôre welcome :P
---
i believe i have them  will not be on until about 2pm Pacific today

IGN Cavman32

Who's throwing him under a Bus? He sounded like a cool guy to me. All I know is you use the Theremin to get to his base just like any other under ground base. As for launching the Nuke he was at the base when it happened. Maybe that was a coincidence but it was the 2nd nuke to launch in 15min. The first one he one shot the Queen and pissed everybody off. That's how I found his base and overheard his conversation with another player he was showing off to.
---
This will be my head canon from now on. :')
---
I won't be on until later, but I need it as well. We could swap.
---
Let me break this down for you... if you are buying 4800 of atoms... you aren‚Äôt going to buy a bunch of 500 atom bundles. That would not make any sense.
---
Sorry to tell you but that creepy laugh comes from the snowman and it is way creepier than whatever lies in the bottom of the lucky hole mine.
---
You're a programmer and a video game designer I take it?
---
It's open for anybody I farm so many losing a few will not hurt me
---
You should be able to link your XB account from within Twitch. Go to the games and loot section in twitch prime, and select the Fallout 76 in-game loot. You should be prompted to link your XB account from there. It's how I did it, but I used the websites, not the apps.
---
Amazon prime -&gt; Twitch Prime -&gt; Bethesda/Xbox
---
yeah wish we could toggle the card to whatever after we unlock the stars
---
Okay that‚Äôs awesome. I have pumpkins and other Halloween stuff near it at my C.A.M.P. near it so I thought it was those. Didn‚Äôt realize it was the snowman.
---
Mine is locked. I know people are frustrated about thieves but I think it‚Äôs rather fun to have something considered valuable enough to have people become wanted on my camp.
---
oh man, I remember when you could double ESC, thought they fixed all those things, well thanks for the info...time to rule once again ;)
---
Thanks, that means I'll be able to join the club as well üòä
---
You got it, bro!
---
No way. The point of a public test server isn't so players can do debugging or QA, it's so they can test the update on a large scale in an environment as close to normal gameplay as possible. You can break the *shit* out the game by misusing console commands, and in ways that aren't immediately obvious. Bethesda doesn't need their data collection skewed by players dicking around with console commands.
---
Still better than the ripper.
---
Oh no. The Wayward took my cozy camping spot. I loved that spot since it was right beside the road and there was the river out back, made it look like a good little pit stop shop. I can see the devs had the same idea though, lol. It really was a great spot.
---
Probably because most ways to actually get wanted are removed. Is there any way to get wanted besides picking a lock?
---
He definitely didn't have any remorse and said he did it because Bethesda wouldn't let him play the way he wanted to. He was like all these tools are here why not let use use them.
---
Yeah, the randomness of drops can drive you insane sometimes. I've gotten 5 plasma grenade plans so far but hardly any PA plans which is what I'm really after.
---
What‚Äôs your perk set up?
---
Are you online now?
---
You‚Äôll get another burrows with that mentality. Besides, I only want commands for xp, armor and weapons. That way it is way closer to real gameplay. I‚Äôd much rather we get access to say a camp terminal that lets you cheat stuff in, then having to fully reset my character.
---
It's just you.
---
Sounds good to me send me a message when you‚Äôre on and we will get it out of the way
---
This would be so amazing.
---
You find skeletons /and/ decomposing bodies, so I imagine that the still organic bodies only died somewhat recently.
---
I do sometimes get a random crash on my PS4 but not as often as you are.      Maybe your ps4 is over heating or something ?   Maybe it‚Äôs dusty inside or something?
---
Amazing, that's so cool.
---
I feel bad for PC players. The game is much more enjoyable on console.
---
this.  If you have access to a private server that's the ticket.  If not you still must server hop to find a non laggy public one.    
---
It's still easily possible for a server to be so laggy that you cannot complete any timed difficulties on public servers.  usually this is on a server that has at least 1 or more active nuke zones but that's not the only tell.  
---
Also just a heads up, a couple patches back they introduced a minor bug.  In the washout mission where you need to break pipes, you no longer can do so using a weapon.  You have to physically walk up to the pipe and click the interact option (on PC this is "E").  It doesn't prevent completions on expert but you can easily fail if you don't know about that and hopefully they will fix it soon as shooting the pipes is much easier/faster.
---
Can this not be done on private servers. say I  invite 7 players and we split in to to groups and just go for it
---
I once fell into a void in the floor at Watoga High school.    My character would fall through the map and land a few steps back from hole.    I could do this over and over again.   Fun!
---
Transfer gifts to low lvl toon to open or even create a new toon. I opened at 100 gifts no plasma grenade sent gifts to lvl 3 toon got plan on like the 10th gift
---
They drink beer? They really are bad ass üòé
---
Could be wrong, but I didn't think the cards are tradeable. Please correct me if I'm wrong though.
---
Anyways, I would simply go melee so you won't have to worry about ammo and melee damage scales with strength, so there's that too.
---
Yeah I am
---
A friend mentioned being triggered by the "jingle" noise and I just thought it was funny, until I went to the mall.  The first time I heard it in real life since the event I actually had an instinctual reaction of "find and kill it quickly" which kind of freaked me out, being that I was in a Walmart.  Pavlov would be proud.
---
Then have it spawn as a legendary in the Purveyor like The Fixer. Make Shishkebabs great again.
---
the hacking on pc is not "rampant" and nw is not "unplayable".    
---
Just block and report hackers when you run into them, and after a few matches you won't wind up in hacker lobbies any more.  I can play NW for 4 hours with exactly 0 hackers on pc these days as I've already blocked every hacker I run into.  
---
It is amazingly easy to spot hackers who fly, kill from afar through walls, and do other clearly obvious things.
---
Bruh I need to do this. I wish I had a large team for something like this. You on ps4?
---
I'm having the same issue. 
---
What do yo mean back up to external?
---
I have an external hard drive as well. 
---
Do you mean just initialize the console only with the game on the external connected/disconnected to not have to re-download the game?
---
probably will just grab your paypal email and use that info to hack into your Bethesda account among other things.,....
---
I always end up in the river in front of my camp with the water invisible and my character sometimes hanging in mid air in his underwear.  Then the water appears and I have to swim to the shore.
---
Abusing an exploit...   hes not hacking.  Lol.  Man oh man.
---
"PC Help"
---
Did anyone else notice in the picture of the camp there's a person working on the generator with a pip boy on there arm??
---
I see many people stating how having the best of whatever handed to you just puts a time limit on the fun it generates. I agree &amp; this is why I always save 'cheats' untill I have milked multiple playthroughs of whatever game I'm playing. Personally I get bored 1 shotting everything in FO4, this is when I'll go on a mad modding spree for immersion &amp; difficulty. 
---
   People who cheat in mmos or battle royales ...it just blows my mind, if ur gonna aim bot/ kill people across the map/ kill whole groups instantly why not just make a kill server button to kill every player logged on?  I mean come on how can that be fun
---
Were does the gift go have never seen a present in there does it say or is it just extra junk that I may not notice
---
Join my game, my GT is GarlicWizard, I'll meet you at my camp near top of the world
---
If you are talking about fighting the queen, if the nuke is launched in the right spot you don't have to go into the zone.   If you just want to farm flux then put on a hazmat suit.
---
yeah I hate his creepy little laugh, and he doesn't need power so he laughs randomly all the time...
---
Funny part about all this...I can get my rad resist higher than PA, yet i insta-die when i run into a nuke zone
---
I shouldn't need to do that or to start playing on a new character. I really like this game but it's currently lacking end game content that can also be enjoyed when playing solo.
---
I'll die for you too later if you need it!
---
They announced in the last patch notes that they‚Äôve adjusted the drop rate of the presents in the Robot to roughly (1 per hour) since a lot of people were upset.
---
I've got a copy of the plans. If you've got plans for Heavy Metal Torso, Heavy Metal Legs, or Sturdy Metal Torso, I'd love to trade. Otherwise I'll let the other guy trade you his plans.
---
The modern ones have a chimney that will go through sloped roofs. Just use half walls to lower the roof (usually in a corner)
---
I think if he feels that way he should make his own video game.
---
If it helps, here is where I went to complete the syringer challenges:
---
\- Wolf: Huntersville. Fast travel to the location. When you spawn, turn around and you'll find 3 wolfs near a cemetery
---
\- Yao Guai: Monongah Overlook. There's always a Yao Guai there
---
\- Radstag: There's a bunch of them all over the Toxic Valley
---
The few I bought sucked compared to the ones I looted. IMO buying is a waste, but caps aren't too useful or difficult to get
---
Mines right between the covered bridge and Flatwoods.  Hopefully I don't have to move it.
---
yep I can confirm this works.  Easy nowadays as everyone has a locked santatron at their camp :)  
---
I'd just add that wanted pvp is harder than "normal" pvp.  the other guy can engage at any time, deals damage immediately and takes a sec to turn red (shooting back speeds that up a bit).  So the other guy has all the initiative and this is at a major advantage.    
---
Still fun though but you WILL get killed the first time you run into anyone with a clue and a halfway decent pvp setup.
---
If you're running AMD, wipe your video drivers and reinstall.  
---
I've had a few problems with video drivers crashing since the patch yesterday. Yeah, the patch didn't touch the visuals side of things but I've still been getting crashes.
---
We seem to always get the short end of the stick.
---
Please not,
---
I don't like being forced to play NW for some good looking rewards.
---
Who knows. Maybe the will sneak things in with each patch like they did with Sheepsquatch and the new Grafton Pawn shop stuff. I would like to meet small bands of settlers,  traders, and raiders leading up to the DLC.
---
It‚Äôs really significant, absolutely love it!
---
I don't think blue screen crashes on PS4 are related to your Internet connection latency (ping). Believe me, if it had anything to do with it, I couldn't even play this game at all.
---
I have a satellite home Internet connection because that's the ONLY thing I can get where I live right now. My pings are absolutely horrible, between 1s and 1.5s on a wired connection.
---
Now, I do get blue screens while playing fo76. But I've had days with 12+ hours of straight play with no crashes. And my connection wasn't better or faster on those days.
---
Bottom line is, ps4 blue screen crashes when playing fo76 ** are due to something else **. I have a friend who plays fo76 as well, he's in a different country with a decent internet connection and gets blue screens as much as I do, if not more.
---
Two important points to note :
---
1) I don't get blue screen crashes while playing any other online game on ps4. It has to do with fallout76.
---
2) I haven't been getting more blue screens since patch16. Just the usual. So I have no idea what is causing this for you. For how long have you been playing fallout76 before that ? How many hours total and since what date ?
---
Good luck.
---
And btw you shouldn't get downvoted, that's ridiculous. Everyone that's been playing this specific game on ps4 has dealt with blue screens as far as I know. Why you'd get downvoted for talking about your gaming experience is beyond me.
---
I got 606, have to settle on 506 now..
---
How did you get those mounted antlers? I‚Äôve been looking for those plans forever because I want a cabin theme very similar to this
---
What? Didn't you know that you can tame Scrip machines to your base. Everybody's doing it.
---
I want more main game rewards instead of things locked behind  Nuclear Winter XP.
---
From the gifts the scorched drop
---
Now I'm going to have even more legendaries!
---
Yeah, I like that they rotate things and constantly try to keep it fresh instead of letting things sit forever, but a week isn't long enough. Especially close to the holiday when a lot of us don't have time to log on.
---
Turn off your vendors and camp will most likely not be found
---
Like 700 people survived the Titanic so...not too bad.
---
In the amount of time it would take to make anew character, level it, and then do the quest, you could probably farm enough caps to to just buy 2 or 3 keycards, maybe a lot more.  
---
So my advice is to just do that instead of grinding new characters.
---
Im making a new one just to get the plasma plan at level 4 since it's the easiest way
---
Can we build it?!
---
I don't have any way of transferring them.
---
If anyone is on PC and has some spare plasma grenade plans I'm very interested. PST.
---
With radshield and diluted rad-x I take only 12 radiation per second on my berserker's build, which for for obvious reason can't use PA and glitch reason hazmat suit.
---
Thats what im asking, its thursday and the boards have been completely black and say "in progress" for 3 days. I would figure there'd be at least some letters to the keywords by now, im wondering if its bugged. Dont they reset on sunday?
---
I often see it for around 150-200 caps
---
This is the way, worked for me after about 15.  Just make sure it‚Äôs a level 4 or under for best odds.
---
Awesome be right there
---
bloody explosive or faster fire rate.  happy hunting.
---
(Im on xbox for reference)
---
You will sell them as fast as you can stock them for 150 each usually.  However, I have found sales to be quite ‚Äòdown‚Äô since the scorched holiday events.
---
I just had 3 holiday scorched out of about 10 scorched. It's definitely RNG.
---
It's listed as a Holiday Gift (or Small or Large) in your Aid tab.  So they're scattered a bit in the list if you sort alphabetically.
---
In the Santatron they should be listed the same, but when you collect them they get deposited into Aid.
---
Thank you so much!
---
85 a piece at most. 
---
Some people try to get 100-200 per for them.  They just arnt worth that with the ease you can farm it now.
---
Check your scrip before and after. It still awards me the 8 scrip.
---
and the mr.handy buzzsaw
---
they are a NW reward. 250 xp i think.
---
Ah ty. Don't have much time for this event but a game or 2 seems to be doing the trick so far. Just want the metal skin and I'll consider it a win.
---
In other news, the post that talked about Bethesda's amazing anti-cheat system was deleted and OP was banned.
---
Just stand in the arc and it gets stronger...when you are about dead jump off the end...repeat
---
There's a guy in our Discord group who is a trader with tons of accounts who gets things by actually putting in the time grinding and trading. He spent 6 months just buying maps from player vendors, finding people trading them on reddit, and grinding them in game. He split them up between group members a few weeks ago and we spent days using them up. Since he's played since Beta he has some legacy stuff he farmed himself back then, but many more that he's traded for over the past year.
---
Not every trader is a hacker or scammer, some find enjoyment in doing it legitimately (if he's got 5* legendaries though he definitely got them from someone who got them illigitimately). Just take a look at some Eve Online traders to get an idea of how dedicated people can be to playing a game like it's a full-time job.
---
Upvote purely for the pun there 
---
Like the idea with the door will give it a go
---
I didn‚Äôt know this.  Awesome, thank you for clarifying/confirming!
---
Not sure yet. Seems like it's leaning towards newer players which is a little bit of a bummer. I have been playing for about a year and I'm really craving more high level content.  Hopefully there is both!!
---
I've gotten into a couple 3 beast fights (maybe 4, hard to keep track!), it's a bit of fun when that happens.  More than 1 or 2 is rare though.
---
FYI - Fireproof makes them trivial, I am more scared of the scorched that try to leave an axe in my skull than the scorchbeasts themselves.  A bit of rad resistance helps too, but usually it's not a huge issue.
---
I have a character for each faction, and then some, and plan on keeping all of them.
---
Well, he had unobtainable stuff, how do you explain that?
---
No problem! Merry Christmas !
---
Number of participants have doubled since my last update. Come join us.
---
Glad to help!
---
I sold all mine in the last couple days at 200.  They don't last too long, even now.  At 150 they seem to fly off the shelves.
---
Mine show up in the actual Santatron container behind his spawn station.  Once you ‚Äòtake‚Äô it from there you can find it in you Aid Tab.
---
And I don‚Äôt want to be forced to front $9 for an outfit that should be in the base game
---
I guess everyone's experience is different. I had ONE crash playing fallout4 (on same ps4 console I play fo76). That's on 500+ hours of play. Granted, I never used mods.
---
I have never heard of someone not experiencing problems playing fo76 on ps4. Granted not many people must go through what you listed -- power cycling ps4, launching in safe mode, rebuilding database everyday, etc. Glad it's working for you.
---
As far as OP's issue goes, more players experience problems with fo76 on ps4 than on x1 or PC. That I'm sure of. Issues with Bethesda games and PlayStation platforms go back to Skyrim or even before.
---
I couldn't guarantee that playing on x1 or PC would fix all your problems but it could help.
---
No. This strongly benefit teams and premades, which pushes solo players like me at even bigger disatvantage.
---
You can revive yourselves without stimpacks, albeit slower, but I cannot heal myself without one.
---
You can have different build, while I have to search for a suitable weapon for my build.
---
You can engage every where, while I need specific situations to ensure survival.
---
So I prefer the tactical game, while you want the braindead fast shooting.
---
I had my turrets attacking eachother earlier too. Really weird. I stored the one that was hostile and put it back down. Really annoying bug üòë.
---
Yes. I wanna play with my established toons, but I also wanna see what it‚Äôs like fresh out of the vault
---
I play solo lol. It benefits players who are more skilled, definitely. But it also forces those less skilled players to fight and get better. There‚Äôs no tactics in hiding under a bed.
---
Thanks for reminding me about the workshops. I know what I'm doing when I get home.
---
That's nicer than my house. Like, the real one I live in.
---
Here's the thing.  I don't have a dog in this fight.  I've met some of the really bad hackers back when this game first came out after Launch.  
---
Those guys did stuff that's way worse, way more blatant, and got away with slaps on the wrist.  They made their hijinks a game, to team up with newbies, offer to help build their camps, and spawn in stuff like airport cannon-turrets and other Dev assets in that poor newb's base, stuff that would never despawn and couldn't be removed via the Camp tool.  
---
So when I saw these things, of course I am thinking it looks hinky.  But it doesn't have to be the same guy doing it, as displaying it.  I honestly have no proof or evidence, and for me to just make an assumption... is just as bad as screwing someone's account over.
---
Now then, the guy I met recently whose base this looks like.... he never said anything to me like what nite0v0owl quoted below.  It's entirely possible he said those things, and told me something entirely different.  But I also didn't make it my business to pull an Inquisition on him either.  I asked him where he got the stuff, he told me about the Taming/Pacifying exploit, told me he got stuff as gifts and payments, and I left it at that.  It's not my place to act like a Dev or Bethesda mod.  I certainly am not getting paid to police their game.
---
As far as what I consider the lesser of two evils, I don't view exploits as the same thing as hacking.  Knowingly exploiting is still a douche move, but it's making use of the tools of the game that the Devs created inside the context of the game.  Like the Excavator armor getting an extra +100 lbs of carry weight is technically an exploit.  Hacking is knowingly bringing in outside tools to circumvent the boundaries of the game, to break the game, and so for me...  I see that as a far worse offense.
---
Anyhow...  I commented because there was already a brewing sentiment of a witch hunt going on, and this sub has a strict policy of forbidding that.  I thought I'd be the voice of reason, cautioning people to not leap to conclusions.  But you all do you.
---
Got it! Thank you so much!!
---
No joke, the grocery store I go to had Halloween stuff out in fucking August.
---
I'm still really, really, really curious how NPC interaction is going to work. In other comparable games, like say Destiny 2, I can talk to a vendor or NPC at the same time someone else is... A year into Fallout and we still can't get past the technical limitation of 1 Vendor to 1 Person. These NPCs sitting outside Vault 76, will I be able to talk to them or will I have to wait for someone else to finish?
---
And if you're getting ready to say "instancing like with Vault 94", I hear ya, but that doesn't fully cover it. The only thing in FO76 where success if shared are Events. Otherwise if I need to use a computer, everyone in my group needs to use a computer but we can all do that at the same time. Will we be able to all talk to NPCs at the same time?
---
We can all talk to Rose at the same time but we don't really interact with Rose the same way we would interact with these NPCs. I'm super interested in WL, looking forward to it of course, but I'd love to see some gameplay so I might know if this is going to work at all.
---
Me too brother
---
that's why I was wondering if I should do a new character, I'm playing since the beta with the same character I'm done with everything except the  tadpole dlc, from the inside the vault article it looks like it is leaning towards new players like you said :/ hope there will be some high lvl content too
---
Was it $50 in atoms, or free with Fallout 1st?
---
One of my toons has 5 or six tick plans from large  gifts. Weirdly, this established toon, which has ground out 18 possum badges, still doesn‚Äôt have the radroach plan.
---
I would if I had a 7 man group willing to do this
---
I know PS4 is terrible for Fallout 4. It's the only console with so many issues. There are some problems that are part of the game, but most of them are because of the console itself. Not sure if that's because of how strict Playstation had been about how things run or not.
---
I have a lot of friends that play FO76 with me, and none of us see the same issues everyone else does. I really think there's another underlying issue that just hasn't been addressed yet. Anyone's guess is as good as mine as to what that is lol.
---
Lmao that sounds like fun, damn wish I played it
---
If you do the dalies and the weeklies they do add up. As long you don‚Äôt spend it on everything.
---
You can stack rad shield (unless they patched that out)  eat a few and be totally fine
---
I didn't say that I support mtx. I would like to have new items in adventure mode instead of NW. I don't like being forced to play that boring pvp grind.
---
Yeah I tried messing around with scrapping/storing to see why it was happening, but then I thought ‚Äúwhy do I care?‚Äù That‚Äôs sort of my attitude towards 76 anymore. I love the game but man, at this point I think I might be too jaded about it.
---
I lol‚Äôd! Didn‚Äôt consider this as a console player. I hate NW enough without the hackers.
---
But caps do have a real money value and people do sell and buy them (I don't, but I know about it)
---
Same here... I was going to snag the huge holiday tree, but it was gone three hours before I got on to buy it :(
---
I have been to this fellows C.A.M.P, he/she \[or is IT the thing to say it atm?\] seemed pretty open about what they had and even showed me around the inside. I didn't think to grab pictures like you did, but yea I didn't see a nuke launch terminal in there. They did have a nice bar setup tho. All in all while I admit some of what was going on in that C.A.M.P was obviously related to this weekends hacker-fest, it was pretty tame and not exactly game breaking. Should this person have all this stuff, no of course not. Does it effect me or other players, not unless I start to use them for my daily script run ;}. I think we should let modders be modders, and stop screaming hacker and calling Daddy Todd over to obliterate anyone who has a nicer C.A.M.P then us.
---
If legendary system will require a reboot, I'll be chosing my new hairstyle before I've even downloaded it
---
Well it did kind of show how inept Bethesda is while also showing how to bypass it üòÇ
---
I didn't realize that was gone too. It's pretty shitty tbh.
---
Is available to purchase with atom, I had to remortgage my house though
---
Power Armor has an inherent hidden Rad Resistance rating.  It's incredibly high, and very few non-PA builds can even come close to half of the inherent value.
---
Since you are in my lobby, I am going to check that.
---
However there is tactics in settings up traps on the one or two ways leading up to your vantage point. And taking 2 players from a team while they try to engage is a huge benefit.
---
If you have fallout 1st you can do it yourself if not maybe find a courier
---
If there is a way I haven't figured it out, fortunately I have about 112 unused levels, but is is still  a BS system.
---
The real wasteland is bethesda game studios, nice camp fire
---
I hav had it since it came out but never seen a gift I heard him say (hope you like your present) or somthing like that once but nothing there might have to have him sent for a oil and lube lol
---
I totally understand that feeling. So much great about the game, it can really ruin the flow when random bugs like this happen. And it costs time.
---
Well curse that hidden number! I experimented one day trying to get my rad resist as high as I could. I was well over the marked rad resist of PA but it made no difference. Even if I lived, it's not a viable way.
---
just a random bit of advice: it never makes sense to have 3 ranks in rifleman and expert rifleman but 0 in master.  The first rank is 10% bonus, and each additional is only 5%.    
---
So for the cost of 6 ranks you get +40% damage from rank 3 each rifleman and expert..  But for example 3 rifleman, 2 exper, 1 master would give you +45% for the exact same cost of 6 ranks.  It's not a game changing improvement but there's exactly 0 reason to NOT get that extra 5% as it is just free damage lying around that you are otherwise just throwing away for no other benefit.
---
He basically covers the whole history of the atom shop and goes into a lot of detail.
---
Check what..? Sometimes I play with other players but usually it‚Äôs solo or with randoms (because once they realize who you are they just follow you around and fight with you). But tonight I‚Äôm running with NoobMaster3000, for example. Someone who a lot of people call a hacker but I know for a fact he‚Äôs not. Again, I understand and sympathize with the group that got this change to happen. It‚Äôs just the biggest blue balling players like us can receive.... we‚Äôre bored as fuck right now lol.
---
Lmao üòÇ
---
You can send them to Twitter
---
It‚Äôs a big circle jerk here with people acting like they know what they‚Äôre talking about when in reality they don‚Äôt lmao
---
Left corner?
---
I have my santatron locked, and its also behind a locked door. Guess i wasnt thinking when i put the "life after death? Trespass here to find out" sign because people have been lock-picking it non stop.
---
I have a bunch of radroach plans. I have a bunch of all of the common mounts and small handfuls of every rare mount.
---
That's what I was saying with the 5* thing. There are a lot of people with unobtainable stuff and who exploit the game and players for profit, I was just reminding people there are players who trade legitimitaley and enjoy doing so for its own sake.
---
Careful on private servers, my friend's is regularly crap for legendaries , mine can be counted on.
---
That often happens here. You get called a shill or 'apologist' and get downvoted if you say you haven't had an issue. The name calling is pathetic. It's not even praising the damn game.
---
I would of recorded it and reported him
---
I don‚Äôt mind it but I wish it was a real hearth fire instead of an faux-electric one.
---
I have 4 characters, slot 5 is for a new Wastelanders guy
---
Truer words have not been whispered in the wastes...
---
I guess I wil just proceed to OHK my way through. I really hope that it wil also introduce some new end game content that can also be enjoyable for solo players.
---
Upvoted for 'Bruthesda'
---
Support this message.
---
My bad, right corner
---
Turrets have been weird for a bit I ditched mine and spend fewer resources repairing things now than when I had them, I seem to get attacked much less.
---
I don‚Äôt have a PS4 pro just a regular PS4 but have been experiencing the same thing. I never really had blue screen crashes before this, and now I‚Äôm lucky if it lasts 10 or 15 minutes. I keep seeing people on here posting these types of issues, I hope they address it. I honestly can‚Äôt play the game and I want to :/
---
The toon I‚Äôve been playing the most has buckets of the rare ones too. I curious how long it takes my tick toon to get Radroach though. It isn‚Äôt like they have terrible rng generally, that‚Äôs the only toon I‚Äôve gotten icicles on.
---
I think because of all the legendary drops there definitely have been some price reductions for sure on certain things.  You find any god tier weapons, hook me up with a good price!  Got a Bloody explosive handmade the other day (2 star) for 5k, I was very happy- and the player probably got it from all these drops recently.  Told my friend on XBL, he says; I'll give you 25k for that right now! lol.. told him I'm keeping this one.
---
Yeah, that happened to me and I was like wtf is going on. I did the exact same of storing it and replacing it.
---
Daisy was a vertibird pilot hinting she was part of the earlier FO lore, possibly with the enclave in FO2?
---
Ya, the raids aren't much fun in my limited experience
---
thats what I was thinking too, thought the blue screen had something to do with the game failing or something fucking up system wise due to the game not the internet connection
---
Just wait an hour and make sure your Santatron spawn station is ‚Äòlocked‚Äô.  It‚Äôs possible that others have just been taking your gifts since yesterday.
---
Has anyone tried this with half walls? I don‚Äôt know the width of the fire place so it might look off.
---
You should do the tadpole stuff. It's a bit of a grind but it's rewarding.  Just finished getting all the tadpole badges and opossum badges the other day. The backpack is awesome.
---
Did you repair the stuff several times before it clicked on what was going on like me lol. I at first would repair at the camp and run off... not sure how many times I repaired it before I noticed what the issue was üòÖ.
---
She had a voice line in the trailer they featured at E3 - we haven't seen the last of her.
---
After my fourth crash, I'm going to play something else. Hopefully a server reset might fix it, but that's me hoping.
---
it dosen't, at least not anymore
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/376690/nuclear-winter-smaller-starting-area-disabled-dec-17-2019?language%5B%5D=en
---
I‚Äôve been playing since beta lol. I used to have a lot of server freezes and server crashes, and i was having a lot of sever crashes last month but I put in a ticket and they actually helped me and the sever crashes stopped. It‚Äôs been running absolutely fine until this update, progressively getting worse. It reminds me of when I played fallout 4 with mods and the game would crash because I didn‚Äôt have them ordered properly. Thanks for the background info.
---
Lol Pavlov, nice
---
I heard about the voice line in the trailer. But I was hoping we would see her again.
---
I play solo as well, a lot more challenging when trying to get 3 newbs to follow you, sometimes very frustrating as well, heh.
---
Toyz7 made a post yesterday about smaller maps being more fun and challenging, I asked him to try playing without his full lvl 200+ premade, no reply, guess thats too much of a challenge
---
That's because when they increased the effective range of the turrets, the turrets started shooting at/aggroing enemies that otherwise would have kept walking.
---
They fixed it yesterday, they are collecting presenta like crazy now. Plus you can drop one at each workshop and get looooooads of presents.
---
That's really well done!
---
Make sure it is getting gifts and you haven‚Äôt changed it to get junk/scrap
---
it's pretty hard for me since I don't have anyone to play with and a lot of them require help:/ I want one of these backpacks so much
---
Mine works fine, wanders all over the place, two gifts in 1 hour last night. I can't say if my turrets would fire at him or not though because I don't have him in their line of fire... They do like to shoot the shit out of each other though if I build them too close to each other. It seems like if one gets damaged it goes rogue it starts shooting at whatever is in front of it
---
I don't play anymore but if your Holiday gets too rough and need an ear. I won't be doing much
---
I'm not a bloodied player, but explosive isn't the meta right now (it's not the best).  5K sounds like a steal, but 25K is on the high side of what I'd expect to get, though I could certainly be wrong about that.  You sure it wasn't level 25? ;-)
---
How is he crafting weapons with legendary effects? This sounds like BS to me.
---
They said that it will run parallel with the current story so you don't have to start over. Wastelanders is supposed to start after we've battled the scorched. So from my understanding if you do the new character you're going to have to do both questlines.
---
Plasma grenade plans are going for less than 10k on the market.
---
Wearing Unyielding by any chance?
---
On PC they are all in their own folder inside the game folder.
---
Yeah but the issue is is that Bethesda isn‚Äôt going to add in adventure mode outfits without having some sort of DLC quest linked to it. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I want to see the Free States come back with Wastelanders too but this seems like the most logical way to introduce their gear (as I fear we won‚Äôt see them in Wastelanders at all) without making people pay real-world money for it
---
The only ones you need help for are 2 revive ones. Encrypted event usually works or a post on here.  Someone will volunteer
---
I had a fight once in white springs south of the clubhouse with a 3* and two 2* scorch beasts. Took me like 20 minutes to kill them
---
Once you while a squad or two they usually just follow haha. Me and Noob both agree he‚Äôs one of the players we struggle with. He‚Äôd be just as good solo too make no mistake. It can be hard to play solo when you have your own community and what not. But it‚Äôs still by far my favorite way to play :)
---
Ahhh, okay, I missed that. Thanks for sharing!
---
I don't have a console, you can't browse files and folders on them?
---
Here I am in a barren CAMP, 4 vending machines, 1 turret, 1 extractor and a 12 neon letters that advertise my CAMP at max budget.
---
Yeah, I saw some guy had all the aluminum trees and the rudolph the red nose radatags and that in his camp a few weeks ago
---
I'm down for the trading interface, and honestly don't understand why it isn't a thing yet, and maybe an actual trading hub would be an okay idea, but I personally like the individual vendor concept. It's unique, and it works well the way it is. No, I don't think they should try and let you browse from the map or otherwise eliminate the cost of hopping around. That's half the fun, and travel costs really aren't that bad at all. This isn't an MMO, and the vending system is actually pretty decent. So what if you run into a couple people who are selling rolls of toilet paper and golf clubs? Nbd.
---
I'm planning to stay on my current character. I don't see why so many people are thinking of starting over- from my understanding Wastelanders is supposed to be after we've been battling the scorched and they're now coming back to Appalachia. Why would you start over? I have two high level girls so I'm planning to play both factions but I don't really feel the need to start over. We'll see when it comes out I guess.
---
  Yea, I had to go back to defiance a couple times myself. :)
---
It just adds up when someone is selling a burnt grognaks comic for 25000c, even if it might be a joke
---
I set a timer for one hour as soon as I logged in last night went back and checked and I had two gifts in mine.
---
Grief players CAMP's then give shit away for free to new players when I feel bad
---
I know that. The NPCs are there from the very beginning, teaching you how to set up a CAMP even. 
---
I know if I start a new character I will have to do everything again, but it seems like from the limited info they provided that the NPCs are basically integrated into  the main story. That just isn‚Äôt the direction I wanted them to go. I was more hoping for truly separate content and leaving the main quest alone.
---
At first no, but I get the reference A LOT.
---
oh okay I'll have to take a look on this and try to finish them myself
---
So is the whole world evolving and we have no chance to play it as intended and released a year ago or are we able to start a fresh character in the lonely world and ‚Äútransfer‚Äù later to the NPC-populated Wastelanders-world?
---
Honestly, I look at it like this. There's games like CSGO (I believe) and Diablo that have markets for people to sell items for real world money. The only problem with this is that none of it is legit
---
I have the dense mod on my chest, so the explosion is little more than a firecracker.
---
It will try and level up the highest one. You need to level the 3 to 4.  Then level another to 3, then another to 2.  Stupid ass system.
---
It's a reasonable mechanic of the game? It's a nuclear blast site, ffs. No, we shouldn't be able to waltz in without some kind of protection other than my brahmin skin/tin can/toilet paper armor.
---
I'm Level 270-something and someone gave me a wrapped gift today out of nowhere.  If that was you, thanks!
---
And if not, thanks anyway!  The world could use more kindness.  Hopefully Christmas will be better than you think.
---
Hopefully they balance out pvp
---
Dense torso mod and 2/3 fireproof.  No more diejng to explosions including Sierra bravos breath weapons.  Alternately wait 60 seconds for the thing to explode and then loot so you don't die.
---
Sure he is, a lot of players are really good, but the fact thay they decided to make an almost unbeatable premade pisses me off, new players get killed over and over again, with no real chance against this sort of premade.
---
Meh, I just hope they one day make a true solo NW
---
If you are on xbox you can add me. Gt:shadyrebob
---
Those people are pretty few and far between. I honestly have way more instances of legitimate stores than non. You must have just had a bad experience today üòÇ
---
oh that makes a lot of sense.. that was the answer I was looking for to decide what I should do. I'll stay with my character. Do you mean the factions we get in wastelanders or the ones in game right now ? cause now there's no way to choose a faction and you have to go through all of them but not actually join any like in fallout 4.
---
I also got 5-6 last nite
---
Haha. More than once. It sucks when I see 30 armors in a vendor from the map, and it‚Äôs all apparel, from a low level. I hope the low levels help the economy though.
---
if you currently own a tenderizer they should give you the plans for it, and then allow you to get legendary rolls from the purveyor. (and then next meet week allow the plans to be earn able)
---
Looks so awesome. My building skills suck I now realize.
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter if you can‚Äôt carry saves, people WILL find ANY exploit to do it. You‚Äôre just giving them more tools to do it with. Plus Bethesda would probably add the ability into the dev room which negates everything you just said. Everything is built in and on the Dev Room
---
Has anyone have this bug? I have ‚ÄúThe fixer‚Äù it says the legendary effects (forgot what they are, I‚Äôll check later) but does not indicate with any stars that it is a legendary.
---
I do think they should separate the categories better. Clothing should have it's own tab, for example. I have every rare outfit in the game, I don't need to end up at a camp that sells nothing but outfits.
---
awesome I'll add you I'm Xindependent77
---
Given the story drives the main questlines and about 1/2 the events....
---
After I launched, took me a session or two to decide 'now what'?
---
'Now what' is earning Pioneer scout badges, tweaking my camp, doing the quests, missions, events I didn't do in the process of completing the main storyline...hunting Santas....
---
Not enough players unfortunately. Yeah I‚Äôm just sad cause that change was so big for me and now we‚Äôre back to snoozeville. It could be argued what I‚Äôm doing is basically the same thing but we‚Äôre tired of running around for half an hour looking for other teams. We‚Äôre also tired of losing to teams with full marine and handmades only because they had just shy of an eternity to loot while we scoured the map searching for them. Game is just super stale and that‚Äôs why these ‚Äúall-star‚Äù squads are being created lol.
---
Sigh, I just wanted to know when.   Until they announce a date, I don't even want to speculate or get my hopes up.   So, is it fair to assume that Bethesda not announcing a date means it's far off?   Or are they just going to surprise us at the last minute?
---
It‚Äôs happening to us all. Go into build, store the turret that is going crazy, then put it back. That should fix it.
---
üëçüëç
---
I agree, chances are it could be just optional early access to the next patch, even with the same character. As far as I know, all patches are already stored as separate files on the client side, so that would in theory make it possible to switch between versions, and with separate servers running the latest "stable" version and the beta, it may be something as simple from the player's point of view as choosing between adventure/private/Nuclear Winter mode.
---
I‚Äôd be more interested if it didn‚Äôt feel so half-assed. All we get on the scorched is a single terminal in the enclave bunker that explains why they exist, not so much what they are or their goals. Everything else is about how everything is getting wiped out by it. It‚Äôs like the Institute in Fallout 4
---
I'm hoping I can trade my plasma grenade plans for the dense combat armor plan after this is all over. Doubtful, but that's what I'm hoping for if I don't get them as a drop.
---
Did u ever fix this
---
I hope this isnt dickish but when I finally get bored with a game I go find something else to do.  There are other games, and there are most definately other activities you could do.  Go nuts.
---
IRL:  Salesmen have to climb a chain fence and fend off dogs to get to my door.
---
In-game:  Salesmen have to climb over piles of dead salesmen and dodge my pet deathclaw to get to the door.
---
"I guess it didn't kill me like everyone else" wouldn't really make a good tagline for a product, all the same.
---
I mean that‚Äôs what I do for the most part, from GTA to this to VR and back again. Maybe Uno or just something to kill time. I liked playing because I‚Äôve got a group that gets together daily. But even they don‚Äôt really do anything except launch nukes constantly. I‚Äôve only been on to trade and complete my collections but even that doesn‚Äôt interest me now
---
Having leveled 6 different builds my perception is that 2 handed melee is easy mode for leveling/farming.  Even with non legendary weapons (and you can always get All Rise from the mayor for a day quest) it does great damage.
---
It seems regular PS4 crashes less than the PS4 Pro in my experience with playing with people with either
---
Morgantown highschool. Also every fission scorched spawn!
---
There's another perk which extends core life - I get at least 6 hours out of a 50% core.  With that, you may not need too carry that many cores.
---
To be fair, it does not seem to make much difference to people who play solo, and avoid interaction or trading with other players. Or at least not yet anyway. Duping is an issue on all platforms, though.
---
I just got my money back
---
I am just connecting a to b that if they featured her in the trailer that we'd see her again
---
Weapons, armor, stable flux and junk.
---
B1515 Cobar rifle- only got it in a trade two days ago but wow!
---
BE+1A Handmade- only level 35 but still. 
---
VE fixer.
---
Nuclear Winter...that is what they made that mode for...PVP
---
I hear ya. I feel bad for solo players though too. The game is much more enjoyable with others.
---
How long was it originally? My friends and I were on for a good 4 - 5 hours and I didn't get a single one.
---
Yeah realized it after I re-read OPs post that I reiterated his statement lol. I definitely agree it‚Äôs too much to make it look smooth in game.
---
Yeah that's what my understanding that is what wastelanders is.. separate from the main quest. So you wouldn't need to start over?
---
That is gorgeous!  Well done!
---
Well I have one girl I think of as a cultist/raider type and the other is more of a helpful type of wanderer so she'd probably be more inclined to help settlers
---
If PC, add me at the same IGN as here. I'll run through with you this weekend
---
There is the issue of dying and the event ending which bugs out your respawn, presumably because there is no more event to return to.
---
If you die around the same time the Event Complete dialog shows up, you won't be able to respawn. Long standing bug. Hasn't been fixed.
---
Legendary robots always explode, and unless some tryhard kills it too quickly, the last robot in AWOL is always Legendary. So either you Stimpack up and run in the moment it dies, then escape just as quickly, or you stay back and carefully watch where it goes after it explodes.
---
Camp item. Find it under floor decorations in the camp build menu.
---
Hmm, thanks. Maybe I just need to build a new one.
---
Reset your santatron, I went from not getting a single one since release to reading the patch notes,installing the new update and getting exactly one per hour every hour just as they stated in the notes. My friends also get one per hour now also just like me so it appears to valid regarding what Bethesda said. 
---
I‚Äôd definitely reset your santatron if I were you. 
---
Goodluck !
---
I get what you're saying, but on the other hand, where do we (or devs) draw the line? And I know he's not gonna get banned, because rarely ever anyone does - but it also makes up part of the image this game has.
---
I personally still love playing it for different reasons, but man, never have experienced such hacker-, bug- and exploit-infested MP game before.
---
Loot from a ghoul, probably during A violent Night.
---
The last time, I started a new character.
---
I wouldn't mind doing this again to start a stealth rifleman, but getting to Lv. 50 is such a slog.
---
I did this 5 times actually. And that slog is what killed my desire to do it anymore. What‚Äôs worse is when the build needs something like 80 levels to get the cards because you‚Äôre forced to take cards even if they don‚Äôt help
---
Isn't 60 scrip the cost of the most expensive item (3-star weapon)? Why would the mystery pick cost 60 scrip?
---
Daily, weekly, survival, world and combat challenges
---
I‚Äôd do 5k personally
---
I found the ones I bought and made myself I got much better loot from. I got the santa crash, grenade plan, snallygaster, glowing one all from bought and made gifts.
---
Just don't have turrets.
---
They seem to frequently go hostile after killing an enemy, and won't stop attacking the Santatron or other targets of opportunity in your CAMP.  It's really stupid.
---
I‚Äôve tried that, they just don‚Äôt interest me. I don‚Äôt want atoms. If it‚Äôs not in the base game then I don‚Äôt need it. I‚Äôve spent the ones I‚Äôve acquired but I don‚Äôt care to actively go do them. It feels more like work than fun. Which is why I‚Äôm so bored. I‚Äôm not finding this fun. Vendor hopping is a bit
---
So mmogfails was right? Wastelanders with Steam?
---
Why not realease the game on Steam now? In time for all the sales. Seriously gimping yourself by not doing this.
---
Recently the event bugged twice when i did it. No bots spawned so another player and myself just sat there waited 15 min and was told it‚Äôs completed and got the usual heavy armor pieces and 40mm nades, very strange.
---
  On one level, yea, the story is disjointed (half-assed? as you put it) , because you get bits and pieces of it from holos and notes made by different people, but you get very little of it sequentially.
---
In your Notes and holo tabs, they are not logically grouped.  Makes it hard to follow an individual story.
---
OTOH, given the overall scenario, it's not like you are able to sit and interview the same person for an extended period to get their whole story in a neat, linear fashion.
---
Consider yourself - part of your story is solely in you head, part is on your phone, part is on your home PC.... if you drive a desk, another part is on your work computer....and none of those parts are in the same place.  
---
Its the same in FO - the story parts from many people are scattered and found in no particular order.  It's up to you to put the pieces together.
---
Lol, I need to DL this game again. Sounds like it is finally getting fun.
---
I've been seeing them for about 5k as well.
---
It‚Äôs 100 usually
---
Both?
---
This is the best way for them to make money. It's been proven and isn't only used by Bethesda.
---
I give them hell all the time, but this isn't something that's entirely on them.

---
Hunt the scorched Santa's.
---
Those are all scrip for me
---
Also, make sure you lock santatron otherwise your presents will be gone from thiefs.
---
Exactly. Got to keep us playing daily so we can check all the great atom shop deals.
---
First event was like that. They though it was too easy.
---
Not bad advice, take a break and come back for events and new dlc.  This is a game not a marriage or religion.
---
Nope, that's three star armor. Weapons are 100
---
Read the way they described it. You don‚Äôt need to start over but it sounds like it would be disjointed if you tried to experience it all after the fact.
---
Hell what about all the stuff people can already get that aren't in the atom shop yet?
---
We know these things exist. Let us have them as a reward. Not everything should be locked behind a pay wall.
---
The thing is everyone is dead and your story doesn‚Äôt matter. Until/unless Wastelanders adds story that changes as you do, then every quest ends almost the same. Everyone is dead, and my entire purpose in this world is to finish everyone else‚Äôs quests. That doesn‚Äôt interest me from a gameplay or role playing standpoint. In the end my character has been dead long before the other games and no choices this character makes has any impact on anything outside of temporary nuke zones. It feels so pointless
---
I agree.  It's not surprising that 76 has such a negative reputation sometimes, because those first 30 levels really suck.  Once I get to 50 and can inherit items from my other characters, it's a lot of fun.
---
Planning to start a new one. We now have a second Xbox in the house so my girlfriend and I can finally play together.
---
We're both gonna make new characters and play along side each other this time around.
---
Same thing on my PS4. I should start taking pictures of the crashing. Didn't crash yesterday.. I was shocked.
---
Far worse since this latest patch.
---
I honestly not bothered how long it takes, cause I‚Äôm actually glad their finally taking their time and hopefully to perfect it
---
I agree I think the player Vending adds to the game.
---
Yeah they fixed it with that update. Mine collects around 4 - 5 Ph at least. Also, with the turret problem, have noticed that laser turret seems to be unaffected. Had 4 guarding my camp with 0 malfunctions.
---
60 is the cheapest 3* as that's the armor price. The weapons both ranged and melee at normally 100 scrip for a 3 star.
---
Yep, and it's awesome. I log in to do my daily maintenance and get multiple presents.
---
I saw camps with that more than once, so it‚Äôs a hack? (PS4)
---
Yeah, was hoping for a FFR, but I was looking for either one for months now.  I remember one time I went to someone's camp (couple of months ago already), he had the max level 3 star bloody handmade with FFR and faster reload.. actually had it in his vendor for 18,500, I remember thinking that's an absurd amount of caps (I was new lol), but also knew it was a good gun, I didn't have the caps for it at the time, and I cringe to think that even if I had the 18k, I probably would have passed up on it because my newbie self thought anything priced over 10k was just greed based and not warranted.
---
Going to be tough to say until the event is over and the dust settles on what people want and couldn‚Äôt get.
---
I‚Äôd suspect 10k a plan is going to be common for the rare ones because caps are easy to come by, creeping up a lot with Wastelanders and the new player influx.
---
Try grabbing a game that's completely different?  I just reinstalled The Fractured but Whole so I could play the DLC I never got to.
---
Did his purveyor do anything very personal for him?
---
I see it every once in a while. Seems like there way they do the events changed. Doesn't pop up as much like it used to.
---
.. while hunt down maddog Malone quest is every 2 seconds it seems.
---
I forgot I had that game. That‚Äôs not a bad idea honestly
---
Looks very nice sir, very creative.
---
Yes. I made that mistake before.
---
Thank you, have a merry Christmas!
---
I am one of the few that has this 3 star legendary weapon. Anti-Armor, Explosive Gat Plasma, i forget what the third prefix is, but i think its like Agil +1 or something to do with Critical Hits in Vats doing something special.   
---
You are correct, it is VERY OP in just about every situation except close-quarters. I can pop a High Voltage Hefe and some PsychoBuff, turn that bad bitch on and literally watch SBQ HP drop. I dont think ive gone through more than 3-4 Cores in that fight from start to end. Goo-ifies everything it touches, including yourself if you dont respect its blast radius.  I have never seen another, so its great to know there is a twin to my weapon out there somewhere.   
---
That being said, I'll likely never get rid of it. My wife pulled it from a honeybeast and gave it to me (she was just gonna sell it!) best weapon ive ever owned.
---
PS4 pro here. System updated and no problems. Do you use LAN or wifi? I'd recommend using a hard line.
---
You can also get a lot of caps and scrip from the gifts. I got 50 scrips from one gift and 1,000 caps from another gift. It‚Äôs rare but it does happen.
---
Thank you! I will definitely let you know! Have a merry Christmas!
---
Cap limit to prevent real world value lol, before the xmas presents youd get like $1 for a million caps.
---
Morgantown Airport has a garden just outside with about 5 of every main need...Razor, corn, tato, melons, not sure about Mutt.
---
Media sells the plasma gun plan relatively cheap?  What you on about.
---
Why the fuck would I want a "Mystery Pick?"
---
I didnt know explosive energy weapons stopped dropping! I've really got a Legendary Legacy then. Never gonna give it up. It never lets me down. Just dont get turned around, it'll melt you.
---
I‚Äôve ran into less than 10 legendary scorched the entire time I‚Äôve played, but since this event started I‚Äôve seen about 20 per day. It‚Äôs a great change of pace.
---
Min character...BE Handmade, Unstoppable Monster, Spiked boxing glove \*bloodied
---
Don‚Äôt burn yourself out on f76 log off for a little bit or play another game and come back when you feel like it (or when wastelanders comes out). That‚Äôs my suggestion and what I personally do.
---
Found the grinch.
---
Fundamental question: Did you have Pacifist Mode on during this encounter?
---
I've had crashing since the event began or around the last patch. I've had excessive lag/stuttering for months, but hadn't crashed since mid summer prior to this last patch.
---
No wayyyy! I'm definitely still interested. Maybe I could give you one of my plans for it? That is very kind of you to do. :-)
---
survival mode was removed a long time ago, workshop PVP can only be triggered if a hostile tries to claim it, no edge sniping. non workshop PVP is triggered only when both sides attack each other to trigger a duel (or an all out battle if its multiple teams)
---
Haha, I'll probably end up spending that much too!
---
What do you mean again? We‚Äôve never seen her.
---
&gt; mutations haven't changed much except with the way Adrenal stacks damage now.
---
Could you please elaborate on this?
---
No it‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôve seen the dev room, but that piece of shit is a mess, look it up on youtube, not to mention how outdated it is, they don‚Äôt even have flux. Half the containers are empty, the other half don‚Äôt have much more than a set of nonlegendary armor. On top of that, getting legendary weapons and armor is a vital part of the game, so not allowing us to create our own items, custom to what we want to use or test with will make it impossible to get accurate testing, which we all know this game needs. For example, if we‚Äôre just granted access to the dev room and we‚Äôre assuming that they cannot spawn in legendary anything, in order to test say, the armor breaking bug from last patch, you‚Äôd have to legitimately obtain an unyielding, bolstering, or vanguards piece, just to do basic testing to make sure you can fix that bug. Had we had a public testing server with the command console, even the most common player would be able to report that their update broke armor. They could probably just add a camp terminal or terminal at the overseers camp at the very least that allows you to cheat in sets of armor with certain effects, as well as XP, scrip, and caps.
---
Glad I could help!
---
Nice to see that Bethesda still hasn't hired someone that can sculpt a face.
---
Most hackers aren't super obvious about it. Most of the time you probably don't even know.
---
I just wish we could have legendary variants of it.
---
Apples and Oranges.  You can't compare 76 to most other games, even 4, they're completely different animals.
---
As an online game, where whatever is over the next hill isn't even determined until you get there, your local system has to load everything in on demand, since it can't know what's there until it 'sees' it.  This doesn't apply to a lot of the world itself, some of the assets are immutable and will always be the same.  
---
But large parts of the map can be changed.  Players can build unknown combinations of assets in most locations.  Plants, junk, and even mob spawns aren't loaded until needed, and all of that has to be communicated to your system, deciphered, and graphically displayed in real time (more or less).  In FO4 and many other games, almost all of that is predetermined and handled on your system, but for 76 it needs to be done over the network before you see it.  That can take time under the best of circumstances, and if you're not operating in the best of circumstances, it will take longer.
---
tl;dr, online games have lag, more so on older systems and on less than stellar network connections.
---
You‚Äôll buy it and you‚Äôll like it.
---
Missing a deadline isn‚Äôt a bait and switch
---
you mean Slocum Joes
---
I don‚Äôt want a nocturnal bashing damage harpoon gun.
---
Look man, I'm not going to Argue_with_you because I agree.
---
Outdated? And where do you get your information from? You do realize even the scrapbox kits are in there (the ones that give 100 flux each). You are aware there are multiple dev rooms with a set master dev room right?
---
Which is hilarious because it was never stated September.
---
I dont PVP, but man is it satisfying to use my AAE Gat Plasma on griefers and turn them to goo when Im just trying to make some goddamn glue on the large farm in the westside of Forest.
---
If they add new perk cards, like a lot. Maybe overhaul/redo the perk card system, well not the system itself but how crafting perk cards have to he equipped and some perk cards that dont exist that should and what not. 
---
Basically if they change it enough, I'll make a new character
---

---
I have them for sale in my shop. A few people asked me if I would just build them in their camp, so I did.
---
Not as thrilled with the mystery pick, but fortunately I am equally looking for all 3 options currently, just sucks the armor is not discounted.
---
25% off sales are kind of weak, but a 75% off sale as you listed would be amazeballs! Buy a 3* for 25 scrip and redeem for 40 scrip. Make profits on every single buy and trade in.
---
That's a steal!
---
You're a legend! Thank you!
---
Yes sir ü§™üëç
---
Oh god I wrote it wrong
---
Hahaha, you selling gifts?
---
They'll just pick the lock and take the five cap wanted level, especailly if they are higher level than you. I ran into this yesterday. Fortunately I had already cleaned out the Santatron, so he got nothing. But he proceeded to try to antagonize me into fighting him until I changed servers.
---
Since then, i've build a building around my Santatron with no door, so there's no way for anyone to steal anything. I just go into build mode and remove a wall when I want to empty it. Shame it's come to this, but these gifts are like drugs apparently.
---
It obviously had to be designed to provide the best possible experience to new players, after all, I doubt the company would have invested that much money into this update if the hope was not that it is going to attract many new players, people who previously refused to buy the game because of the lack of living human NPCs and dialogue/story choices.
---
But the new part of the story will probably also work well enough on its own if you already completed the original game. From how it was described in the interviews, I get the impression that the level scaling system will be reworked significantly with the "normalization" coming with Wastelanders, and the game will generally become harder for high level players. The intention is to reduce the difference in power between newbies and those who have already been playing for a long time.
---
Right?  Nor is it a job.  It's supposed to be fun and nothing else.  So when it stops being leisure it's time to reevaluate some things.
---
You get a free holiday gift for every 25k you spend.  üòã
---
Makes sense.
---
They said the interactions will Be instanced. So multiple people can talk at a time.
---
I‚Äôm deleting
---
Is that applicable to any chest armour?
---
I'm wearing a 3 star raider unyielding. Chest armour piece?
---
I got the plasma grenade plans and just learned it but I don't have duplicates at this point.
---
That's awesome. I'll probably grind for those eventually too. My luck has been that I got the plasma grenade plan from a gift yesterday.
---
anything that is a non-automatic rifle.
---
Sorry I had to. But yes the 25% doesn't feel that impressive after we had the one 50% sale.
---
At minimum the perverters mystery pick should be lowered to 50 scrip. It will feel like such a whammy when you pull an armor piece at regular price.
---
I did the math once, but it's been a bit so don't quote me on these...but when it's easy to get 30K caps, and the odds of getting *just that one perfect* combination are 1:50,000 (that's the purveyor number, random drops are much worse), then yeah 10K is nothing.
---
Although, for most people, there isn't *just one* item that they would be satisfied with, so in reality it's not quite as bad as it sounds.
---
The RMT are even happier to have customers like you.
---
Weapons don't level past 50. What platform are you on?
---
You can literally spawn in every single container in there. Sure it requires hacks, but that‚Äôs where I get my info from.
---
Maybe. I'm using the same one I've had built though.
---
Aren't survival mode and Adventure mode the same thing anyway? I know it had better PVP and XP but overall its the same. I did not now that, but even after the fact while he was climbing the cliff-side and in side the Workshops area he exchanged shots and my gun tickled him while he stomped me down.
---
Where would one buy them? From the train stations or from player vending machines?
---
That sound logical to me.
---
To bad I can't respawn anywhere else and in the process loose all my accumulated resources üôÅ
---
Is it possible to get all achievments for colllected magazines?
---
I'm a level 203 and got most of the weapon plans from small gifts. All the rare mounted head plans were only found in large gifts for me. A lot of the time the large gifts have 2 plans.
---
Probably!
---
I am at work but I am about 80% sure I did not. When I bought this game I learn about Pacifist Mode and made sure to turn that noise off.
---
So you‚Äôre claiming you hack, then admit to doing things that are bannable, then try to convince everyone else that everyone on console should be able to access similar game breaking tools that you‚Äôre using?
---
Indeed. They are exceedingly valuable.
---
Lever action rifles are pretty sweet if you aren‚Äôt already using one
---
Oh man! If I had a duplicate of that plan I'd give it to you.
---
Just any type of melee weapon
---
It's the spinning camera of death right? It's very unfortunate. If the bot explodes, you could always wait some time for the metal pile to generate in its place if you don't want to risk the explosion.
---
Another rifle with a different ammo type :)
---
Of course they need to attract new players. My point is i don‚Äôt understand how I will organically follow my way through the path of the main story to meet the new characters. With a new character you will follow the path naturally. If the put a character outside Abby‚Äôs bunker, for example, I currently have no reason to go there but would find them naturally by following the main quest. Does that make sense? I feel like you aren‚Äôt understanding what I‚Äôm trying to say.
---
I seriously think all my rare plans came from purchased gifts!
---
I play on PC, My bad, I gained the weapon at level 70, I didnt notice the guns dont level past 50.
---
The 42 levels doesn't matter *nearly* as much as the time spent grinding for better gear.  A fresh level 50, even if they planned their perks out very well, will not be a match for someone who's gotten the right equipment.
---
Farming legendaries isn't hard, but luck still plays a part (not the stat luck, just your personal luck).  It's a bit of a cascading thing, they're hard to farm until you get a couple upgrades, then suddenly you're swimming in legendary drops and are just waiting for the good ones to keep.
---
Cryolator, Flamer, Gamma Gun, Gauss Rifle, and Radium Rifle also no longer drop with the explosive effect.
---
That's how I see it. You can get caps at any point in time.
---
The Gatling is my fall back weapon. Hits good and dependable.
---
best place to buy serums is player vendors, if they have MISC items in their store they may be serums. they sell for about 200 to 2K in caps on average. or you can spend roughly 5K and buy it from the Enclave Bunker.
---
Survival mode used to have unhindered PVP, no damage reduction, no nothing. it was removed when barely many people played it and was replaced with Nuclear winter.
---
That‚Äôs correct. The raiders home baseüòÄ
---
Probably new character. If the update turns out to be good enough, maybe on a private world, for one month, that is about fair price for expansion sized content.
---
No, I‚Äôve stumbled across people who hack, because guess what? It‚Äôs super fucking easy to hack with an anti-cheat that can be avoided by a middle schooler. Then I came on Reddit to say that in order to have a game that doesn‚Äôt have bugs like the fucking armor glitch that ruined armor for a week, making a bunch of players quit the game for that week and in general, we need to have the ability to get items that you can get people to spawn in for you in the normal game, without having to make hacks, so we can make sure Bethesda can release an update.
---
You can make 2 gifts from 1 large gift wrap with the science perk card. Everyday you can buy another one if you sell enough to the vendors.
---
I like this ALOT.
---
That's true brother
---
Tell me about it :) literally just a minute ago swapped a DCG claw for heavy metal arms :D
---
I would defiantly go for that. A new plan for a new weapon or mod would work nicely.
---
Against snow? Besides having to retexture everything from workspace, enemies, etc.... why not disable the ATX shop, rebalance and fix issues,  and actually give us the game we paid for? As far as I'm aware, Fraud, fraud never changes.
---
I pretty much left enough caps just to fast travel.
---
4999 caps since everyone is selling them for 5000
---
Another semi auto weapon so you use a single perk pool.
---
Let me put it like this, pc is already ruined. They can already do this. So leave pc to do the work and then they‚Äôll port the code in a copy paste like they always do. It‚Äôs not as complicated as you think it is
---
Late January or early-Mid Feb 
---
In the worst scenario Mid march 
---
Personally I‚Äôm with Early February
---
I just meant see her in general. Sorry for poor wording.
---
You damn well better!
---
TODDDDD!!!!
---
I;m doing the same thing. Just wish the gift paper was a little bit cheaper! lol
---
I'm hoping you're right
---
Hahaha, said like a true collector!
---
February, late January at the earliest. I hope it‚Äôs not delayed a second time.
---
I agree, I currently carry a Handmade BE15 5.56, Fixer BFFR .45 and a combat rifle VE90 .38.  Covers a range of ammo and situations.
---
Yeah I know, we also need more better challenges that doesn't take a few days to complete for the veteran players. Like for me, it's hard to complete any for high priced atoms. I mostly just got challenges that takes along time like kill 1000 robots with this weapon, kill 1200 robots with this weapon. Collect 7600 wood. That all takes way too long if you want multiple items really high priced.
---
Oh i have no problem starting over and re grinding everything im just sad for all the stuff i had i used bloodied stealth build with  bloodied meathook dropped easy 62k dmg i only want my stuff back so i can back it up to a secondary acc so i wont have be scared that i might character deleted again
---
My husband makes fun of me when I play. He says, "Saving money in real life but turning into a shopping addict in the game." :-D
---
Best go buy a lottery ticket.
---
How about were able to craft our own picture frames of various sizes to put the photos we take in them! Buyers coming to your camp can see your friends and cool places you've been to.
---
If you wait it explodes and the body is thrown randomly and it's very hard to find after that unfortunately ü•∫
---
Saving for Christmas day? That should be fun!
---
Thats why I left 5k it's enough to fast travel and buy ammo as needed with alittle left over for if I see something I want in a vendor
---
I understand the issues with story continuity, but one can only speculate how well it will be solved in practice, and how the design of the new quests interacts with progress in the old story line.
---
&gt;You can make 2 gifts from 1 large gift wrap with the science perk card. 
---
It's Chemist, not Science
---
Exactly!
---
id suggest a shotgun if you have room for enforcer in your build, if you blow stealth or get swarmed you can cripple everything then go for the weakspot super easy.
---
You need to give them your money faster!
---
I know I know.  
---
Limb damage was accidentally removed and the next patch it‚Äôll be put back on all legendary purveyor purchases. 
---
Happy now?!
---
You‚Äôre making it seem as if porting save files that are saved by the server, to another game that probably won‚Äôt support that save file is an easy thing to do.
---
Yeah I saw reference of a "slight cultist resurgence" and I am eager to learn more
---
Yes, every torso has an applicable dense mod plan.  Most are very rare so you may need to ask a person with good karma to mod it for caps.  I saw the raider dense plan just a day or two ago in a vendor for 5k.  I was close to buying it!  The plus with the urban/forest scout stuff is you can just go buy the mod, in the military wing of the bunker, for every mod possible.
---
You act like game developers actually rewrite the same code 3 times
---
25 caps!? That's insane!
---
I have also gotten several icicle lights and santa crashes.
---
Had that happen in Uranium Fever once before.
---
They want people to know there working on it, getting excited for its pending release but not show it all off at the same time hence there reason for being tight lipped on the raiders and cultists.
---
If I ever get one!
---
Rust like PVP with no legendaries, levels persist through death but reset each week, drop all on death
---
I hate to break it to you, but basically every major business does this
---
I like the character bio previews!
---
Tell ur wording to get a job
---
I just wonder if a fix/small update can break the game or make it worst, then how would they go implementing something as big as wastelanders. For some reason I think they can't do it. But I hope I'm wrong
---
If I was Bethesda id do the same thing. If I worked for Bethesda I'd have to do the same thing.
---
Goal is to make money. Gets harder as the game gets older.
---
If you miss out, who cares it was free and wasn't meant to be, even though I was pretty bummed I missed thy glowing skeleton. Glad they brought it back.
---
NW isn't even that bad, just barebones.
---
I know what you mean, I just need that damn frog!! lol
---
I was using that already with a quad handmade as a backup, got to agree that it is great
---
They must be sitting on like 20 duplicate plans!
---
Nice. I got them all too without purchasing. Multiples too. They're so common they're getting hard to sell :/
---
Oh nice!
---
I‚Äôll agree with something another commenter mentioned when they said that the bluescreen probably doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with internet connectivity. But, (and here‚Äôs something I‚Äôve mentioned to a few people with disconnection problems) the first thing you really should do is just login to your WiFi admin and double check if your router needs a firmware update.
---
If it needs one, it‚Äôll just take about 15 minutes or so to update and reboot. Then check your connection speeds again to see if there‚Äôs been any improvement.
---
All my rare heads were only from large ones for me.
---
Take the time between now and Wastelanders to take a solid break. This happened to me with Ark (have a severe hate love relationship with that game) and being away from it for 6 months made it fun again- at least with friends. Maybe you've just burnt yourself too much. Get away for a while.
---
I'm aware, I stay away from it. Singleplayer games, tons of free mods/content. :D
---
Love the icicles, want more so all my toon can have them!
---
The large gifts are really only good for the mounted creature plans. Medium gifts actually have the highest chance for the rare weapon and armor plans, but small gifts have the best caps-to-plans ratio, with only a slightly lower chance than medium gifts.
---
And a melee backup for those unexpected runs when shit breaks or ammo runs out.
---
Under stash boxes
---
Yeah endgame can be boring. I'm a crazy lil bastard so I usually switch my build on the same character. Like I just switched from a normal melee build to a bloodied commando build so I can switch my play style. You could make alts with certain rules to spice things up or you could help out low levels or play with friends. Other than that you could just mess around.
---
That's very kind of you. You never know what people are going thru and something small can really help. I hope you have a nice Christmas.
---
When I was a rifleman I used a AAE handmade w/hardened receiver and a mix of either instigating double vats combat rifle or instigating 33% hit chance +1 Ag lever action.  Now I'm a commando and use the same handmade w/powerful auto as my backup and an AA less vats Fixer as my main.
---
oh man I'm so jealous :( my girlfriend has a Xbox too I was trying to convince her to get 76 to play together but she's working a lot and doesn't have any time to play right now :( if she would get it and okay with me I'd start a new character too.
---
Um maybe for 250c at best but probably not it‚Äôs just a level 1.
---
All I need is the frog plan and players that have it are asking 10k every time. When you're asking for it they markup the price I think...
---
I feel the same with 76. I enjoy a Fallout-like (this feels too colorful and cheery instead of desolate and barely surviving) experience with friends, but this game also has been the most stressful game I‚Äôve ever played just from the basic bugs and imbalances. The new exploits make it even less fun
---
crafting perk cards should be equipped all the time without taking the special stats place.
---
I'm going to your camp to buy! lol
---
Sadly the exploits and modding come from the fact that this game is built in a engine that modders are more familiar with than the devs. But I do agree that this.... individual is hurting the games image.
---
your main point is still valid, if they can add so many things into the game, don't just make us pay for it all, give us a reason to keep playing by adding in new quests/events/etc etc that will reward new stuff, or simply add in new stuff into existing loot pools but make them rare---- keep us hunting!
---
Get a hammer and bonk them. Bonk the all.
---
Yes we have to wait and see. All I‚Äôm saying is right now it seems like this is going to be less interesting and more of ‚Äúadding NPCs‚Äù vs adding on to the story line. I was hoping to find out what happens after we nuke Prime.
---
Look, I made a suggestion to improve this game, then you come shit on it, because ‚ÄútHe EcOnOmY mAtTeRs‚Äù in a game where every update adds a new dupe to the game. The least of this games worries is cheated items, but since this post isn‚Äôt going to be listened to by anyone, I guess even the devs have stopped giving a shit.
---
Only critique... demo expert is diminishing returns after 1 perk card for legendary Exp effects. Unless you plan to run Grenade launches or missile launchers (no bear arms on your character) only take 1 point in it. Or, do yourself a favor and go junkies.
---
yup
---
it is great, I like it a lot as well, but it does anyone else notice its sound is louder than everything else in your CAMP?
---
Purveyor event is kinda lame. Instead of choosing armor or weapon, Purveyor chooses for us basically. I'd rather just choose weapon or armor. I was hoping for another Purveyor sale like during Thanksgiving, but oh well.
---
Everything else looks good though.
---
Aside from getting off track, I find it amusing that this sort of thing is not more upvoted.
---
Who the fuck doesnt want cool unique outfits from challenges incentivizing new forms of gameplay? Tons of games do this already. I.e.; new coats you could get in the Division by hunting down crashed drones etc.
---
I'd definitely buy from you!
---
I've been getting quite a few! I got 4 presents in about 2 hours last night, a large, medium and 2 small. Got the sloth plan I didn't have yet.
---
oh i see what youre thinking about a completely solo fallout experience.
---
Tank killer for sure. All three rifleman cards maxxed. If you're using a pipe rifle, then pistol cards (Agility) also work, but just for that weapon. And if you're a solo player like me, Lone Wandered. Ig you don't use power armor (also like me) then max out Ironclad (Endurance).
---
Also sneak, sneak, sneak, and sneak. Did I say sneak? =P
---
Hiw didyou get the mounted antlers? I've been looking for those plans for months!
---
I'd be surprised if Wastelanders arrives before March.
---
I know right
---
I would complain less about them not adding in game content you can EARN if the atom shop prices were 25-50% lower.
---
Price is just too damn high for a lot of low effort "content" from bethesda, such as items ported over from Fallout 4
---
There's a market for low level Legendaries.  It might not be the most valuable item, but you'll get more than 250 caps.  I advise going to check out the other subreddit, apparently we're not supposed to provide direct links here.  But it's where "this little piggy went to..." with a 76 added on.
---
&gt; We play video games when we want to, not when the game wants us to. 
---
Upvote bonus points for this and the Bruthesda. I needed a laugh.
---
Thanks I‚Äôm still going to do a bloodied build but thanks for the opinion I‚Äôll look into it.
---
RMT? I got my legacy weapon legit from a drop, Glowing HoneyBeast, at the Cabins in the Savage Divide, before they were made into legacy. Back when the bastuds would break half a core in. leaving you high and dry. If you dont believe me, you can read back on my post history, where I describe this problem WAAAAY back in beta. But you probably wont do that, will you? I don't even buy Atom, what makes you think im stupid enough to give people money? Does it look like i have money? :rofl:
---
The scrap box is under stash boxes and it should be the second one down from the top.
---
Look, I get it, I really do. Hell my suggestion got shadow flagged and removed without any warning. The devs might care, but Bethesda doesn‚Äôt. They don‚Äôt want to invest money they don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll get a return on and they won‚Äôt invest to take a risk either. They‚Äôve constantly shown they‚Äôll take the cheapest, easiest way out. Evidence? They clearly didn‚Äôt do jack shit to test the 250DR before releasing it. And the community is worse than Bethesda. In game most people are amazing. On reddit everyone treats this game like it‚Äôs their salvation and will attack you if you‚Äôre even slightly negative towards it. I‚Äôd like this game to improve. But no one is listening until they find a way to make money off your idea. It feels nice to vent and say things that should‚Äôve been common sense, but you‚Äôll just be downvoted because people don‚Äôt want suggestions. They want happy content that shows that they made a good purchase. I‚Äôve gotten well over $60 worth of time out of this game. But I‚Äôve still never had $60 worth of fun from this game
---
A bit early to say yet really. Though I have been starting up characters and deleting them because of Altitus kicking around. I've been meaning to make an actual commando/rifleman character for awhile now, and I think I may do that with Wasterlanders. Though I do want to check out how things are going first with my main.
---
If you have excavator, you can carry up to 1720 # before you hit crawl speed. Equip it, go someplace with a train station nearby.  
---
Kill everything, loot everything that is not nailed down.  You'll get a few things you want to keep.
---
bonus if the train stations has a tinker bench, as you can bulk stuff that otherwise cant be sold (cloth and leather, for example)
---
When you are near that max weight, goto the local train station.  Scrap what you need, equip hard bargain, pop a grape mentats, and drink a mountain honey - anything that boosts charisma.
---
Sell everything you looted.
---
Do that once, maybe twice, and you are at max caps
---
then buy at least a medium quality gift wrap.  
---
Bonus: when you buy gift wrap, part of the caps you just spent go back to the vendor, so you can go loot and resell even more :)
---
4%
---
Link or it didn‚Äôt happen.
---
I‚Äôll most probably do both, most probably bowman build, but my new character would be 7th one
---
Well, with that math it makes it seem as if you thought Bethesda would give you a game worth more than it‚Äôs price tag.
---
They just came out, best drop I've found was in the large handmade gifts.
---
I've spent a fortune on wrapping paper.
---
Current one. I don't play often enough to justify starting over. I'm not grinding out every single thing all over again.
---
Yeah I can agree on the too bright / colorful kind of tone. I feel like the world should be in much worse condition than it is. I feel like if you swapped Fallout 4 with Fallout 76 in terms of physical land it might make sense - since it's been 200 years and things have had time to regrow. After playing ark tho nothing will ever be as stressful to me since you can lose literally every single ounce of progress at the drop of a hat. Fallout 76 definitely has it's fair share of frustrating bugs that can burn you out easily. Made the mistake of moving my camp and went into a 2 hour voyage of trying to rebuild when the base doesn't want to place down etc
---
Irrigators
---
From my original post:
---
&gt; And if you're getting ready to say "instancing like with Vault 94", I hear ya, but that doesn't fully cover it.
---
Will they be like a vendor which are explicitly not instanced, or will they be like a computer. Instancing stuff like in Vault 94 doesn't necessarily apply here at all.
---
Yea! Don‚Äôt feel bad, I just learned at the beginning of this event lol.
---
I was hopeful to get a loot bag reskin to match the present emote for OCD reasons.
---
I didn‚Äôt expect more. I expected close to value. My idea of the value of this game is around $10. I tried to refund it. I was denied. So I played because I didn‚Äôt want $60 to be wasted. This game has caused me more stress than any other I‚Äôve ever played and that includes rage games
---
Looks good broham!
---
Damn! Good catch!!!
---
PITA but i finished the other day too! Good job!!
---
Looks like ah'ma goin' scorched hunt'n...
---
Magical thing about survival was that it was both fast paced AND the tactics won every time.
---
Nice! I‚Äôve done Manhunt 8 billion times and got the western outfit with chaps last week.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e8vtip/nuclear_winter_unlockschallenges_for_christmas/
---
The last update bugged many of the daily quests and their reward pop-ups. But the rewards and scrip are still being given and experience is still being credited. The experience isn‚Äôt really that much, so the bar just doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs moved.
---
As for fast travel, it‚Äôs a common occurrence now that fast travel will auto-cancel for little reason, but it‚Äôs not specific to VTU. Sometimes it‚Äôll work if I take a little more time in-between button presses, but still that‚Äôs not consistent. Hopefully they‚Äôll get that addressed sooner rather than later.
---
True, I wouldn't mind smaller circles with smaller amounts (because normally it waits for like 22 people), to not have to wait for like 20-30min for a game within non-peak hours.
---
And I definitely agree, smaller circle, slightly up the rate of crates etc.
---
Pavlov....Pavlov.... why does that name ring a bell?
---
Pipe revolver still benefits from both rifleman and Gunslinger perks, and is incredibly easy to mod and maintain as far as repairs and ammo.
---
Congrats
---
That's what I'm starting to think.   I'd rather just prepare myself for the wait than to get my hopes up honestly.
---
Holy shit man good work! (Also how did you get the restore power to any power plant to proc for the electrion badge?).
---
I never have to use power armor. Most people who do the queen know how to launch so you can fight outside the nuke zone so no power armor needed. The only reason you'd need it is if you want to go into the nuke zone itself to farm flux and don't want to wear the hazmat suit. Power armor is not necessary. Helpful at low levels, but not required by any means.
---
Ho, interesting to know we can receive quest rewards in the gifts ._.
---
I enjoy it
---
Looks really good hope I can come across it to really look at it
---
I don‚Äôt know the coding. All I can tell you is the output will be that only you hear and see their responses to you. That‚Äôs what they‚Äôve shared with us.
---
One of my toons rocks the beard year round.
---
I recently changed it to a keypad door, so they can't even pick that, because there are ALOT of people stealing now. With there being a present in the machine basically everytime you check, it worth 5 caps being wanted for people to even check
---
Everything else works fine tho. If I was having issues with other games or apps maybe, but FO76 is the only thing having an issue and it started at update 16 and got a lot worse after the patch they added.
---
Well that‚Äôs a bummer But you have a good one. (Congrats!)
---
From the XMB/Dashboard, go to Profile in the top row, pick the 3 dots on the profile screen and select Online ID. There's a webpage with details on there and if a game you play is affected by the name change, it's typically leaderboard stuff.
---
Yah been seeing it a lot on FB and in game
---
From what? The PlayStation website?
---
thank you
---
Didn't you post this yesterday.
---
I agree some of the items definitely are over priced
---
yep, found a large gift in my workshop today
---
It's interesting to me as a psychology exercise, how such an amazing and generous community (as reported here and elsewhere) can start to devolve into selfishness once a valuable commodity is added to the environment. Holiday gifts seem to really have impacted the morality of some of the player base.
---
That's not a statement at you, but the community as a whole. I find it very interesting as a phenomenon. TL;DR Gifts are crack.
---
1- yes you can still earn both rewards that are available so far
---
2- wreath is in wall decor packages are in floor decor
---
3- yes all toons can use rewards
---
On the actual PS4, not certain of the process on their website.
---
they've essentially shown off a small group of people as they want the rest to be a surprise
---
I‚Äôm glad you are getting some actual recommendations. 
---
Every time these posts come up everyone attacks the poster which is ridiculous. This is the only game I‚Äôve ever played on PS4 where crashing is an issue. I was having a good run before patch 16 but had 2 blue screens and a server disconnect last night alone.
---
And everyone will come out saying ‚Äúmy game works fine so it‚Äôs your fault blah blah blah‚Äù while ignoring the fact that tons of people on this subreddit post about crashing issues so there‚Äôs obviously an issue with the game, even if it‚Äôs not something everyone is dealing with.
---
Sorry had to rant a little but I hate that people always get shit on in these posts.
---
Nah, I did contemplate shooting it to destroy it though, as I really didn‚Äôt know what was going on. Then thought what if my other turrets start shooting me as I have the max amount.
---
Plus my santatron station is at about a quarter health now, because of the rogue turret.
---
No, I just assumed you meant the website. Thanks. I‚Äôll check it out. :)
---
I don't think you have to be in NW to see them... for sure the daily challenges for NW show up in Adventure, but the Adventure challenges do not show up in NW.
---
That war drum is pretty freaking big.
---
No problem, best of luck!
---
Yea it‚Äôs good to just take a break, gaming isn‚Äôt supposed to be stressful. But if anything I‚Äôm learning a lot about the technicalities of online gaming.
---
Me too. Excited to meet Mort.
---
How weird i had the same thing happen, i put a support ticket they activated it the next day, dogs ay
---
Conflagration it looks Lit
---
Ye honestly it just building up to the point of giving unsellables away
---
Yeah it sucks.  The more I play this mode, the more Frog legs feels like a required perk.  More often than not, it seems like the match is won by a guy in Marine armor with Frog legs and a 50 cal machine gun.   I have the frog legs card but I don't want to sink 9 points into agility.  I have points to spare and I could easily respec, but then may character would not be optimal for adventure mode.
---
Thanks!
---
This is my goal. I got the plasma grenade plan last night. =)
---
Assuming what is the logical: no character progression in test servers.
---
Good idea, dangerous implementation proposal, solution: make a test-only vendor that allows you to create custom weaponry and armory. An NPC serving the very same purpose w/o exposing internal mechanics of the game in the form of console.
---
If anybody is afraid of duping or exploits: we couldn‚Äôt hit worse than we are now. On the PC versions there are still items that are unobtainable in the game, such as explosive plasma rifles, explosive alien blasters, that were made with 3rd party tools and that were not removed in the last purge, and that are now in circulation. Hackers introduced NPCs to the game before Bethesda did. Don‚Äôt be afraid it will get worse: it won‚Äôt, we hit rock bottom already. Let those willing help.
---
Ye honestly its building up to the point of giving these items away. It makes no sense to why we cant sell them to vendors
---
They said the old questline will still be available parallel to the new questline.
---
You are correct! It does still work!
---
When I scroll down the list I see the wreath unlocked. I really hope I don't have to fill out a support ticket. I haven't had much luck getting resolution to my reported issues.
---
I have a Shovel that is e?90rw never used it so far, but it is there for fighting and digging if I need it.  I also keep a Q5090RW Tesla for tagging at group events.
---
Looks cozy for the time of year though.
---
Update just checked it after only being on line for an hour and there are 4 in it .lol
---
Same same.
---
The scrap box is really addictive. Be aware of its power.
---
He's right they don't show up in the list. And ols don't start with the time and blabla. It's the second day and i haven't done any of them, yet none of them 2 are listed.
---
You mean.. should your *friend* buy fallout first?
---
i agree, it is very addicting to carry a bunch of junk and hear it all clang into the box when i scrap and store all
---
If you ever buy Atoms, then it‚Äôs definitely worth it at least once.
---
No as in I‚Äôm asking for answers from some who‚Äôs already bought it
---
Do u know what happens to the scrap box if the time expires?
---
Same for me. I actually don't have much luck finding the santa scorched, so I just scrap/sell and make my own. I got plasma grenade, snallygaster, and feral ghoul all this way.
---
I keep mine locked and trapped inside a walled off room with no doors so I can collect my presents.
---
People can glitch through doors by using power armor.
---
No offense taken.
---
Yeah, I think it‚Äôs about role playing for me.  Generally on my farm character I hand out goodies because I‚Äôm constantly overweight.
---
However, I recently start a new character during double XP (lvl 29 now) and I want this character to be the more ‚Äòevil‚Äô version that engages in PvP, steals, etc.  it‚Äôs less about stealing items but more about playing a very different role.
---
Picking a lock on a door that does nothing but get you ‚Äòwanted‚Äô doesn‚Äôt seem nearly as satisfying as picking the Santatron lock and truly being mischievous and evil.
---
All junk stays and can be used. You just can‚Äôt add anything anymore.
---
So the box just stays and you can‚Äôt anything else and it doesn‚Äôt affect the weight?
---
If you play the game regularly and can spare the cash, your experience will be that it is the ideal way to play the game. Note: I did not say ‚Äúworth it‚Äù or ‚Äúhas value‚Äù but it is the ideal way to play the game
---
First question: do you plan on spending any money whatsoever on Atoms? If so, a month of 1st is the best value. 
---
Other questions: would you actually use the 1st exclusive cosmetics, like the Desert Ranger outfit or dance emotes? How much would you use a private world? You'll definitely get some use out of the scrapbox and survival tent.
---
Come on down, the price s right!
---
Yeah my only use is the the tent and scrap box
---
:-)
---
Isn't it beautiful just nuking the whole place?
---
Play something good
---
Geez...!  Someone come take these kids that claim me as their dad so I can get home and monitor Santatron.
---
Carry a decent two handed melee weapon, for when you get ghoul rushed somewhere like white springs
---
Or if we could bundle and sell ammo. Like 20 .38 sell for 1 cap.
---
I dont know what I would do without the 1st perks.  They do change QoL in game enough to be worth it.
---
If you are a regular player,  you will notice a difference in  your fun immediately.
---
No more worrying about which junk items you need to get rid of, or how much they weigh.
---
Free fast travel point with the tent, that doenst cost anything to move (basically  you get a mobile stash/junk box, bed, banjo and cook station)
---
The dances are neat.  The fashion is too.
---
^(I'm gonna frick Mort)
---
cool. rip pets
---
Does the XP keep adding up? So when I log in for the next day when the reward for that day is ready to be unlocked since I have gained multiple points the day before will it unlock automatically or do I need to start from scratch each day to get that reward? 
---
It‚Äôs confusing as all get out! üò°
---
Which are the rare ones? I presume the ones I don't alreay have 3-5 of in my vendor (e.g. tick, radstag, etc). I put my dupes up for 25c with the rest of my plans, and they don't sell even at that.
---
 I got snallygaster and feral ghoul last night, along with plasma grenade. I presume these are all rare. Haven't found dupes of these yet.
---
With all the new players, and the expected influx after Christmas, I‚Äôve been stocking Level 5 Heavy Studded Leather Deep Pocketed Armor sets alongside my max level Legendary Armors. 
---
Hopefully this doesn‚Äôt annoy any higher level shoppers, but I like to help out the new guys &amp; gals.
---
I am honestly suprised they didn't just lift the trade interface from FO1/2. The 2 offer system would have been perfect for this.
---
I got trapped in a murder camp the other day however the guy was an idiot and it was kind of obvious... in addition there was a stash box right in the beginning so I already stored my junk.
---
When I'm outside of PA I have 365 with all Deep-Pocketed Marine armor. When I enter the PA the amount stays the same at 365.
---
And I got 7 at the fissure site near Camp Venture before I even started mining ultracite veins. It‚Äôs all random.
---
Yes. Instigating at low level is great. So is bloodied (even though berserker is way better at low levels.)
---
The legendary will turn into a scrap pile wherever it exploded even if it is thrown a distance the pile will always return there.   When it has rehealed itself and almost dead just run right at it full guns blazing and get the loot before the explosion....Run the event in PA and you can survive the explosion even bloodied build....There are many ways to accomplish this event without dying
---
On xbox I view the image with the UI hidden, then take a screenshot. Now it's a Xbox image, not just a Fallout 76 image.
---
reality is often disappointing.
---
Basically agree, except for the personal nuke terminal. That shyte is wrong.
---
Well does your friend like the currently available clothes/emotes or just want to try the scrapbox? Honestly the scrap box can be really addicting. I bought 1 month because I wanted the mothman emote and I like the outfit but the tent and the scrap box were also really convenient. Being able to put the tent in the bog so I can have my camp up in the Savage Divide to split up fast travel costs was really helpful for farming and the scrap box is so nice for your junk. My stash is really free right now. But now that I can't put any more junk in the scrap box now that my sub is over -i don't want to pick up anymore junk. Because I don't want to clutter my stash again. But I'd rather pay 1 month for the sub and only get things I want than pay for a year of the sub.
---
What do you play on? I've been buying it every month on xbox and then immediately canceling and refunding. I get full access for free, just gotta repeat the process every month.
---
Another semi auto rifle with limb damage. Plasma I think is best option. More versatile.
---
Yes exactly. It just taunts you because you can't add anymore to it. But.. if you wanna buy it for a month and stuff as much literal junk as you can to live off of for months - you could.
---
No, those items came into the atomic shop Dec 2018.
---
So. It hasn't been confirmed yet but it's been stated that it appear in game time has actually "sped up" a bit. Not sure if it was to get the game to a specific date in time for wastelanders or something else weird got tweaked in the back but actual days to night are seemingly shorter so I don't think that it is that thirst has increased but just that the rate if time passed in game has been rated up.
---

---
I'm gonna have mine locked until I can be sure I got all those rare plans, then the lock is coming off.
---
Swap receivers on fixer and combat rifle. You lose less DPS.
---
This is exactly what happens...I took Poseiden the other day and a scorch ran between 2 turrets and hit each other....they both became red and the others started shooting at them and then all of them started shooting at each other...I would not really call it a bug, they just turn on each other if they get hit in crossfire...too many turrets or too close to each other.
---
We've had this problem since beta. Only private servers fix it.
---
AFAIK only the Wreath and Presents are available?
---
You aren't finding a backpack, you're finding the specific instructions for how to fabricate your own. 
---
You'll figure that out if you try to get plans for excavator or ultracite the quest methods as well.
---
It's a really bright white very obviously santa beard- not sure how post-apocalyptic that is.
---
A plan scripping machine would definitely ease up a lot of the stress my stash is under.
---
That‚Äôs the appeal. I lot of countries such as Russia, China and Korea have people that do this sort of a thing for a living. This wouldn‚Äôt be the only game they are doing this with. Lots of them work for companies and get paid hourly to scam, dupe, cheat and farm. The game is looked at as a way to pay rent and eat as fucked up as that seems.
---
I just have a nuclear winter character. Do you use all 5 slots?
---
XP you gain towards one reward doesn't count toward others &amp; you have to unlock each one in order...but All XP you gain towards each reward does rollover each day so you don't start from scratch. If that helps
---
Man I really need to get my ass into gear and work on completing those soon because I don't wanna be behind when they release the next challenges.
---
I mean, it is *kinda* true, if you dont believe him check out every, single one of the dead BOS guys in PA. Not only do they have the same face (quintuplets?) but they are also mysteriously wearing vault 76 suits. Exact same chartacter model used every time. Maybe vault 76 is a cloning vault, and that's why we all wake up at weird times with no memory.
---
I'll probably do both! I make new characters to experiment with different builds from time to time anyways so.
---
Make it BOS branded. Turn in plans to unlock Server Time on their main archive.
---
Yeah i just hid mine in the walled off room where my fusion generator is so no one can go in there anyway.
---
Yes makes perfect sense now. I was hoping that was the case. I didn‚Äôt want to be playing NW for nothing whilst I could be farming gifts too.
---
I will both..
---
old toon to kill any and all unprotected NPCs.. new toon to play along with them
---
Wait so youre telling me its not even christmas yet and christmas items are starting to leave the shop? 
---
Its like the opposite of seeing christmas trees before haloween.
---
DID YOU REPORT IT?! 
---
And does that DO anything. I has something like this happen with a guy in a sun mask dropping other sun masks. Refused and they left. Keep running into other players completely open about this practice of selling for real money. I try to shame them best I can before reporting and blocking..the report part DOES get looked at, I would hope. That's better than nothing, eh? So long as we report when we see it?
---
Either you accidentally had pacifist on or were extremely unlucky that he popped serendipity everytime.
---
The fact that you don't do PVP makes it more believable than the guy I met last night with legacy weapons, quad explosive harpoon and full strangler power armor who also said it was all legit. This of course was after he told me to go buy duped weapons if I wanted to be considered a real PVPer.
---
It is safer to make the assumption all PVP legacy weapons are duped. 90% of all PVPers I meet have the same exact stuff. Legacy gatling plasma, beam splitter legacy energy gun, strangler heart armor, quad tesla, quad harpoon. The playerbase are hypocrites. We cry about pay to win when stuff comes to the atomic shop, but then go and buy the best, and often bugged, weapons the game has to offer. Hell, the bugged ones can only be obtained from dupers now.
---
I always make sure my last login in Adventure mode because of this.  If your last login was NW and new challenges post, some or all will be auto completed.
---
if they wronged you, why dont you share so the rest of us can look out for each other.
---
Dont be a schmuck like Schiff, actually share your evidence.
---
We all would like to know what mistake was made so we can make sure we dont fall for the same issue.
---
I would love to be able to trade in my plans for a chance at better / rare plans.
---
I tried to view Challenges while in NW and nothing shows for me besides the challenges to use 3 Stims and Take Photos in Vault 51.
---
as dumb as it sounds- i‚Äôm going to use the notepad on my mobile to record my XP each match... 
---
if you play before 7pm ET the presents prize is only 500XP
---
 build them bc you're using free resources to do so.
---
I wanted atoms so I bought a month.  Getting 6 or so items free immediately is awesome.  Not sure if I'll be consistent in my sub.
---
To be fair this is what I do at present..
---
as of this moment, yes.
---
next award is available in like 2 hours
---
Yeah I actually level as a bloody build. Had a bloody rolling pin.
---
The wreath should be. Can you hop in a match and send a screenshot from your character's challenges?
---
Anyone can feel free to roast me or offer advice, but:

For 13 bucks, i got 1650 atoms, the ranger outfit, an armored variant (only available during the month i signed up), two dance emotes, and some player icons.
---
As a bonus, for the month i get private worlds (i like the social aspect of 76, so i only ever use this when i need to jump on quick for 5-10 minutes), a fast travel tent (i put it near the legendary vender. I am rolling in caps so while this is convenient, i wont miss the 20 caps when i go to the purveyour), and the scrap box (okay, yes, i love having it, but on the other hand i use most of my scrap as soon as i get it to craft ammo/repair weapons. The rest just sits there when i used to bulk it to sell)
---
So, worth it for just a month? Yes. Woeth it after that? Onoy if you really like the private world, the scrapbox, and the tent. Or if you plan to buy like 15 dollars worth of atoms every month anyway.
---
you‚Äôre fortunate, i don‚Äôt see it as completed but luckily i know to check atom shop to see if i have it
---
Is that true? I justthought you spent your own resources on built items
---
I want the BOS flag.
---
Was playing last night and it certainly felt like the spawn rate was reduced to me.
---
LOL, frog legs doesn‚Äôt help for mines or grenades. And if you ever get in a gunfight woh me, please just jump straight up freeing yourself from any cover and let me laser you :)
---
It‚Äôs good for mobility, but if you are losing to people because of it, you need to work on your aim.
---
Green=free; white=your own resources
---
What sucks: Aquaboy, Demo expert, Savior.
---
Adrenaline - 1 star is enough.
---
No blocker? You gonna have a bad time from anything that melees you.
---
Looks like deuces wild...
---
Yeah,  As soon as i got the beard i tred to chande my hair color to match. it bummed me out that the 'white' hair is greyer than the beard.
---
My beef with Warframe right now is the Nightwave stuff. I just can't play enough to earn that stuff (e.g. Umbral Formas, unique cosmetics). I'd rather be able to buy them even if was after a period of Nightwave exclusivity.
---
I stand by my dislike of battle passes and even free ones like Nightwave are just a different way to promote FOMO (fear of missing out).
---
Thank you, good advice üòéü§òüèª
---
I wonder what happens when you kill a npc and other player comes there we'll be respawn on the server or you have to switch servers.. I hope not all of them will be unable to die though
---
You can get black powder legendaries from Xmas scorched. Are they not on the normal legendary drop list I take it? What's the normal list even look like?
---
I never play NW
---
I put nearly all of my plans up for 25c, including that one. I spent a lot of time searching for plans when I was starting, so it's just returning the favor now. I also don't really want to research to find what something is worth. I'm not trying to milk every cap out of each sale. I price to move, and 25c is my standard price.
---
Now that only goes so far. I'm not putting the plasma grenade plan up for 25c. =P
---
This looks like a Bloodied build because you even put Nerd Rage which rarely activates if you are using a full health build.
---
I doubt the use of Suppressor because you rarely get a long fight with very hard hitting opponents that is actually able to hit you with one of its hard hitting attacks and you have to keep landing shots.
---
Portable Power only saves you 7.5lbs for each PA when you are not wearing them because pieces in the frame do not weight, and a PA frame also do not weight when you are wearing it. Don't use it unless you have multiple pieces picked up and/or multiple frames on you. I'd use Excavator for regular farming and T51 with Jet Pack for heavier fights and some convenience, but I am using a Bloodied build so I just use Excavator with Emergency Protocol. You can also choose T60 for cheap repairs, or X01 for just being cool.
---
First Aid is nice, I used it before and used Dilluted Stimpaks instead of regular Stimpak, you can do the same or just use regular Stimpaks so you can have less Stimpaks on you, but there is this mutation called Healing Factor that regenerates your health when you are out of combat, so I ditched this perk later on.
---
Power User is most useful when using Gatling Lasers, in PA it is still useful when you run a lot or fly a lot or use VATS a lot but Fusion Cores are easy to get by claiming power plants, if you have the time to farm some cores you can ditch it.
---
I don't like using maxed Adrenaline because I feel like it's wasting too many points but it's really a personal preference.
---
Serendipity do not activate while in PA, ditch it if you are going full on PA all the time.
---
U have to be in NW to see them
---
When do the two NPCs get added?
---
Well, that is the normal cause.  I got nothing then, sorry ‚òπ
---
FOMO is powerful for some players, but for me, I don't see how tricking a few people into buying something on impulse is better than having stuff available to everyone all the time.
---
Some suit, somewhere, must have declared that it's more profitable to bait people into impulse purchases rather than keeping something be available all the time.
---
What they don't account for is people that want something, think about it, and eventually (and certainly) buy it. If it's no longer available that's just lost money. Sure you get that impulse purchase from some other guy, but it's lost money of the people who take a week to buy something.
---
I suppose it depends the content you focus on. I really enjoy crafting and building so for me the scrapbox alone is worth it and everything else is gravy.
---
You shouldn't get downvoted for having a valid opinion.  I recently started a couple of new RP style characters for this very reason.  Whatever it is, whenever it comes, I'll be ready!
---
Truly expensive Laser Rifles cannot be bought by caps though...
---
Just like u/Xerhes said. 
---
In fact, for the ‚ÄòBuild X items‚Äô Atom Challenges, workshops are a solid strategy. Build the items until one of the resources goes white, then scrap and repeat. Use Contractor and you‚Äôll get even more value. 
---
One day I‚Äôll hit that ‚ÄòBuild 7600 items‚Äô challenges. 
---
But not today lol.
---
Marine armor has high rad resistance. You can also stack rad-x with radshield and stand next to a scorchbeast all day.
---
They can hire me, I'll do it for 'em.
---
Yes , soemtimes even costing real dollars , but caps cam buy 556 which is usually used in high price trades
---
My goodness, yes. We need to do something with old plans. I can't even easily give them to alts! I swear a majority of my weight is plans and I just can't bring myself to delete them.
---
I heard that about NW. Weird righr?
---
I assumed it was, since I saw the aluminum trees before they were in the Atom Store. They could've been released last year and they're just "returning" this year ??
---
 My real xmas is going to be tough.  I had to say goodbye to my best doggo friend 5 days ago.   It's killing me.   A part of me died when he left.
---
I dig it, though I wish you could change the color:  https://i.imgur.com/51c0mjj.jpg
---
Or they could just not remove items or make it to where atoms were an in game currency like caps or srip that can be found or it could be that you can buy atoms with caps
---
Probably the weapon or legendary itself did
---
Network lag I understand and forgive. What I'm talking about is raw performance. As you said, there are dynamic, user-generated assets which can affect performance, but they seldom alter preexisting assets, only contribute to them. Most of the world is static and immutable (i.e. mountains, valleys, forests, cities), and therefore should be instanced and rendered locally, just as in Fallout 4. My issue seems to be the rendering of these statics, as no amount of waiting for server-side updates improves the framerate, and the issue persists in the same locations no matter the server or player presence. I have to either look away or move away to fix it.
---
Still, I can't be sure unless Bethesda introduces offline play or, heh, ^(patches out the lag). Until then, which system are you using, and does the game slow down in certain areas for you? Maybe my console's trying to tell me to cut the rope.
---
Why demo expert? 
---
What should I do instead of savior? Blocker?
---
Keeping aqua because of personal preferences.
---
Well if you can rejoin that sameserver, you will find that everything is still there and you can reclaim it.
---
And you are not using your resources when building in workshops, as long as the respective resource is shown green in the menu.
---
When i joined a match i could see them indeed. Well i did all the halloween's ones and you could see them from adventure as well.strange these only show when you enter a match
---
Exactly. My main is at 65 NW, but will never have froggy, not changing his stats. When I finally reach 100 I will play NW with my sneak riflewoman. I do the easy NW dailies with her, one more duplicate card and I can buy the seemingly required frog legs. Still don't understand why marsupial is a perk card instead of mutation.
---
They said it will be using the Creation engine like the Fallout and Elder Scrolls games so chances are it will be broken and buggy and they've not shown anything because they can't get it to "just work".
---
At least that event pops up every five minutes.
---
Bloody warden can't keep Mag Dog Malone locked up long enough for me to have a pee after aiding in his arrest for the umpteenth time.
---
Unsure what kind of example he is trying to set here :P
---
Makes sense, I don't specifically remember them or seeing them in the build menus so I presumed it was hax since I am on PC
---
I think it's one of those expectation vs reality
---
There was more to the story than that. He linked something that was from beta and when people called him out on it he refused to edit his post. Essentially he‚Äôs right that Bethesda sucks for their lack of anti cheat but he was also quite obnoxious. Even the folks at r/fallout were giving him a hard time and they hate fallout 76.
---
Hope this isn't a PS4 thing. I am obsessive about my dailies.
---
Eh, this stuff doesn't matter to non-traders (unless people with OP weapons don't let you tag the enemies).
---
I disagree about it "not mattering". You give it meaning by caring about it. I knew going into the mistress of mystery questline that it would end with everybody involved dead, but i wanted to know how and why. It's probably my favorite questline story in any fallout game now.
---
The reason there is a cap oncurrency is to preserve its value. Look at Diablo 2 where gold is literally worthless.
---
You have it backwards. Supply drives value down, not up.
---
Thanks. Yea I don‚Äôt understand. Oh well
---
I don't see all the rewards available to be unlocked in my challenges list. Only Wreath and Presents. Is there a reason for that?
---
PC
---
I tried it. I can‚Äôt experience it the way you did because it doesn‚Äôt interest me. I don‚Äôt care how these people died, or what their stories were. I‚Äôm interested in what I can do to change the world of the game, in this case there‚Äôs nothing
---
I‚Äôm eager to know what the faction will be coming with Wastelanders update
---
I would say that's odd since yesterday I could see those challenges logged in adventure mode. Not sure what changed. Also the Halloween rewards tracked and unlocked without any issue.
---
Oh cool! Congrats.
---
You can just travel out
---
Ye sometimes when I see a level 1 yet to exit the vault I wait and drop a ton of plans just because I cant sell them anywhere.
---
you using maxed out gunsmith?
---
Those have never actually existed as an item. Right?
---
&gt;BUT I CANNOT PLAY IT SINCE THE UPDATE. IT CRASHES EVERY 10 MINUTES
---
Did you by chance have anything in your inventory or on character that was, perhaps,  a bit shady? I only ask because they did run scripts to remove spawned items. If something in your cache is pointing to it and it doesn't exist anymore...?
---
Can you post a tutorial on how you built the fireplace?
---
No, that takes way too many points from damage dealing perks. I shouldn‚Äôt have to though, I should be getting many times more shots than I‚Äôm getting right now.
---
Can‚Äôt confirms FPS but ISS fire axe with + strength is hot
---
I run a Bloodied Super sledge with Unyielding armour and Radcool and Nerd Rage. I get about 1k base damage per swing with it being only half health. All Rise only got to about 500 tops for me.
---
Friend got it for me and honestly it is ya game changer
---
They were for sale in the atom store last week. Was my first atom purchase
---
Simple, get a Junkies weapon with Swing Speed.
---
Junkies give +50% damage at 5 addictions and Swing Speed is essentially +40% to your DPS. So that's a +90% to the DPS of the respective weapon.
---
Meat Hook / DCG / Power Fist / Bear Arm / Super Sledge should be good enough.
---
Maybe even a fully modded Baseball bat / Fire Axe / Pickaxe.
---
Not to speak for the OP but the whole "only cosmetic mtx" thing was a total lie. A blatant, bold faced, unapologetic lie. I also feel that the "content free forever" was a lie as well seeing that private servers, refrigerators, and a slew of other items cross the blurry line into being actual content.
---
Oh yes! Works wonderful! Lol
---
That's so nice!
---
Uhh no?
---
I have a 1080. I doubt it‚Äôs anything to do with drivers though, the issue only started happening when Bethesda touched their game again.
---
I was under the impression over repaired weapons/armor no longer get bonus damage/resistances.
---
I think that was patched out a long time ago. Over repair isn‚Äôt supposed to increase damage or armor
---
They should just remove it and remove frog legs, no matter how many times they take a swing at it, Frog Legs will always be this great perk that's going to feel 'required' to win. Game was so much more fun in the beginning when people didn't unlock it at the time.
---
Oh I should elaborate - it looks like a normal camp where you can shop so I did but it's a 1 way in - 1 way out type of camp as you have to step on a pressure plate to get in and can't go back out that way which I thought was odd but went in anyway. I was on my way out after stashing my things and the wall to my right looked weird but I couldn't figure it out but I went forward anyway like a dingus and it was stacked punji boards with traps in between. Being a bloody build I was toast in seconds but I didnt lose anything and it gave me a laugh.
---
Uh, I guess I shoulda said  non-junkies too.
---
No it doesn‚Äôt. Lots of people are reporting the issue across all platforms. Do some research before trying to blame the person who‚Äôs having the issue.
---
One reward is unlocked each day at 7PM EST until all of them are unlocked.
---
Yes, no one should be a schmuck like you and make condemning statements and not even attempt to explain them.
---
Hmm, I didn't know that. Guess I'll stop using those repair kits I get from the SBQ...
---
thanx for the reply. if i could provide some safe-guard measures to help prevent anyone else from befalling the same fate, i would. but there isn't. the jest of it is that we all play *their* game, it's not *our* game.
---
if you want more to go off of, just know that the game bugged/glitched out on me and my account got suspended the next day. some people get "snallygaster spit explosion" or "behemoth stomp" put into their miscellaneous tab when this happens. i got a little red/yellow stashbox looking thing that i couldn't do anything with. 
---
since then, 3 support tickets, 23 emails and 1 month has gone by. not one response, reply, or contact has been made on Bethesda's end. 
---
if i was guilty, i'd be more understanding.
---
unfortunately, 1 month for this old sailor is too long. i was a beta player and had only one account. played at least a couple hours everyday. this was the only game i played. had a little less than 2k hours invested along with hundreds of dollars spent.
---
Use my current one to help the settlers, make a new one to join the raiders.
---
Then Instigating with Swing Speed, first hit on enemy full health is +100% damage then you get +40% DPS for rest of the hits.
---
It‚Äôs not my end. I‚Äôve had a normal experience until this last maintenance, with the same crash on using an aid item everyone else was getting and whatever else. This last maintenance fucked the game for people across all platforms.
---
Are you certain you aren't watching Sienfeld in the background?
---
It's a good passive farming method definitely. Still pales in comparison to glassed caverns
---
Depends on the weapon and situation I think
---
They're so smart, they're useless.
---
Instigating Grognak Axe with plus 50% crits  with all three Lvl3 melee perk cards?
---
Watch yourself mate. I‚Äôll spend my money how I choose and that doesn‚Äôt negate my right to be able to play the game.
---
I'll have to look for one and see how the DPS compares. Thanks!
---
Lucky you I suppose but this comment doesn‚Äôt really contribute towards the discussion.
---
The combat rifle I only use for low level areas for the most part it is just a fun gun for the forest.  I like the fixer for queen fights unless I want to swap for my one of primed weapons.
---
Does 50% crits do more damage than swing speed?
---
What?
---
I do the same thing, if the weapon is better than the one I am using I will keep it, if not but if it is a decent roll I will sell it for caps only and usually pretty cheap cause they get snapped up pretty quick, I don‚Äôt run mules or have alts so could care less about trading or transferring over to another toon, I just play one toon and just can‚Äôt be bothered with all that
---
Like night stand small from the looks of it
---
Melee or the pipe build
---
I would guess theyll be in the next atom shop update. Idk why they wait and release this stuff the day before the holiday. I want to decorate the day after Halloween like every other obsessed person!
---
I've noticed it as well. It seems to happen when text in the upper right pop up. In my case it was disease notifications.
---
Just find a regular Super Sledge and do the math.
---
Actually I think any Super Sledge with Swing Speed should be good enough, iirc All rise do not so 40% more damage per hit when compared to a normal Super Sledge.
---
I‚Äôm at least it‚Äôs more useful than the ripper üôÑ
---
Perhaps It is due to the New check they implemented.
---
How do you change the lock to a keypad door? Also, if you put the Santatron in an enclosed room, does he have enough room to wander and find stuff?
---
I found it odd aswell but I couldn't see the first one in adventure, probably a new "feature*
---
Really? I've gotten jack from Glassed Cavern ü§î
---
That is not true
---
If I get time tomorrow
---
You might as well use them - they're just going to take up your weight if you don't. It's a free repair.
---
This is nice, I run a similar build with the exception of 1/3 concentrated fire. Do u feel 3/3 concentrated fire worth it?
---
I wrote an article yesterday about what if they put snow into the main build of fo 76, I believe what you are saying is true but, I haven't encountered any major issues in a while.
---
Maybe bethesda is finally getting it together.
---
... there's your problem
---
Ops! Yes, you're right.
---
I think the glassed caverns is where Santa Scorched is located.
---
I'm just trying to get ONE plan! The frog...
---
I get about 50-60 an hour
---
OK, I'll look for a Super Sledge with Swing Speed.
---
For one you don't need to do repairs as much.
---
Improves durability do not repair as often.
---
weapons and armor no longer get a bonus to DR or Dmg based on item condition. 
---
This was patched out like 6 months ago.
---
Weapons and armor no longer have stat changes for over 100% condition.
---
All that over 100% does now is make your items last longer before its required to be repaired.
---
You can build in parts of flatwoods - last time I checked there's a building there you can build right on top of. More urban setting.
---
* Not running Gunsmith perk for durability. 
---
* Using Explosive effect which increases breakage.
---
* Using faster fire rate which produces more hits and therefore, more breakage.
---
"I wonder why my weapon breaks so quickly." üòê
---
You could at least put a forceful stock on it or something.
---
If you don't mind a couple of low level Scorched, try Wilson Brother's Auto Repair. It's north of Gorge Junkyard, in the forest. You can incorporate the building in to your C.A.M.P.  I believe you may be able to add internal doors. Plus there's a free PA station
---
Started since last patch.  Weapons and armour both deteriorate faster now.
---
True, it might break the game, but Bethesda is trying their best to get it together right now.
---
They're goods devs but, they need to focus more about the player and less about the money.
---
This.
---
Repair kits is all I use anymore.  Saves time finding a workbench, and mats.
---
It allows me to use my junk for more important things, like making water purifiers, or ammo.
---
Do the math though, I cannot log in now so I can't confirm.
---
Send a ticket.
---
There is no such thing as faster fire rate and explosive. It's reload speed.
---
You can‚Äôt have explosive and faster fire rate on the same weapon, fr means faster reload.
---
I have over 1000 hours in 76 and have been using BE weapons for a long time. I‚Äôve been using this fixer exclusively for a while, before the last patch/maintenance. Its maximum durability has at the very least been quartered.
---
The fact that this bug exists isn‚Äôt up for discussion and I wasn‚Äôt asking IF it exists, I‚Äôm asking why. I‚Äôd also like to know if there‚Äôs a fix.
---
Ive noticed it too. It only happens on certain toons tho. So IDK what is up with it.
---
Yes, rendering of the loaded assets is an issue often. But less of the world is static than you might think.  While the game doesn't have to individually load every asset as an individual entity, it does have to load the location and state of them, and almost every rock, tree, and plant in the game can have more than one state.  Next time you build a new camp, take a look at how many things can be removed by placing a foundation down...a few kinds of trees and rocks can't be erased, but most everything can.
---
I don't console, so I can't speak to your rig, but it's possible that it's not performing up to snuff, or that it is just barely cut out for the game.  But even if you end up getting a high end PC, you will still occasionally see those kinds of slowdowns...less noticeable and less frequent, but they're still there.
---
This was going to be my suggestion too. Great "lived in" location for what you are looking for.
---
Yeah I haven't had to manually repair my things for a long time.
---
You cannot change the santatron to keypad. You need to put him in a 1 by 1 enclosed room, door at the front if you like and keypad door at the back to access your loot.
---
For me he just stands in the doorway talking, but still collects items/presents. I prefer this because I like him as a decoration to my camp, so he's always in his little spot saying his Christmas lines.
---
The collectron station should block people being able to get access into the room and your keypad door at the back will allow you access when needed, and stop others.
---
No it isn‚Äôt. The maximum durability has at the very least been quartered. If you‚Äôre lucky enough to not be experiencing the bug, kindly move along and don‚Äôt troll. Thank you.
---
I got an IM on X Box once from a low level player (57) to please come help him.  he was trapped in the WS Golf Club with three 3\* SB's and surrounded by Ghouls.. Didn't"t believe him at first but wandered over.  From front of Club House didn't see anything and was expecting griefers but once I got on the roof and on the back awning there they were.  So many explosions and concussion I could hardly ever see to fire back, not much damage due to PA and Lvl 3 Fireproof.  Killed all the Scorched I could see in the Club House and on the ground and jumped down.  All three 3\* SB's landed in succession and wiped them out with a Furious Gatling Plasma.  Got one good drop, 2\* AA Gatling Plasma.
---
That's because over repaired weapons/armor no longer get bonus damage/resistances.
---
That was patched out quite a while back.
---
Not those lights.  The ones last week we're spherical, not tapered like the ones in the picture.
---
We don't have those individually placed presents either, so there is some speculation that they will drop a third round of Christmas stuff next Tuesday.
---
Oh god
---
Thanks, do you know if it‚Äôs intended or another bug?
---
3 points in Blocker in strength = -45% incoming meele  and that makes glowing ghouls in a nuke zone obsolete with a rad x
---
I got a disease last night and kept getting the same base line when the effects hit.  It caught me off guard at first, but then had me laughing about it.  I was totally expecting Kramer to bust through my door lol
---
Yea I been trying for days at fort defiance
---
Giddy up
---
Power User Lvl 3.
---
EVERYTHING deteriorated fast. 
---
Weapons. Armor. Food.  Thirst. Hunger. 
---
It‚Äôs on purpose and it‚Äôs 2000% shit. 
---
They break things to make you buy in order to get them working again.  
---
I can‚Äôt believe anyone falls for this.  I just walk away all together.  Sure that. Screw Todd.
---
If you want the atoms or the outfit, go for it, that's why I got it.
---
Until I got the Scrap box addiction, one more reason to go keep my sub.
---
Like other's have said, Wilson's a great location.  There's two low level Scorched spawn points on the cell, but if you set up turrets, that's just free shotguns and ammo that regularly drop.  I was actually just thinking to myself that the Red Rocket bundle in the Atom store is *PERFECT* to set that area up with.  
---
Also- if you position your camp placement just so, you can also include part of the house just behind the garage as well, allowing you to incorporate both the garage and the home into the camp, saving you some budget on structures.
---
You have to harvest the Ultracite.  Every time you pick some, there's a chance of spawning a wave of Scorched which frequently has one or more Santa Scorched in it.
---
Love using private server persistence to swap stuff between characters...
---
No.
---
Nope. While there have been a few exceptions, those were bugs and not intended. Otherwise, atom stuff is exclusive to those who paid. If you didn't buy it, you can't have it.
---
And saves the trouble of switching perks.
---
That's pretty badass if I may say...
---
So, the doorway is in front of the fireplace, and the actual width of the fire zone itself is as wide as the doorway. That's genius level right there. I've done a few things with doorways as well, another level I'll have to try.
---
I've seen many of fireplaces/mantels where they differ in color from the walls, either painted brink, glazed (sealed) brick, or just as is in contrast to the other walls. This way the fireplace/mantel pops and is the center of anyone's visual focus.
---
It's too bad you cannot reverse the position, and have the fireplace out only a foot or two, like a normal fireplace.
---
But I REALLY like this üòâ
---
I know weapons are broken and armour is too (noticed my armour breaks quite a bit faster too) but does hunger and thirst really go down faster as well?
---
It also doesn't look like they made the tail end of the Santa hat physics simulated either, right?  Just permanently attached to the side like that.
---
Weirdest for me was when manhunt and jailbreak event was both on the map at the same time. Guys, you don't have to break him out, he is already on the run!
---
I crash almost every time I enter a workbench (regular PS4).
---
I wonder if I'm alone, haven't seen a post about it that I can upvote.
---
First workbench crash occurred \~ 24h ago, before I updated my PS4.
---
I don't crash when I don't use workbenches but I freeze a lot.
---
No, I have no idea how you can even cheat on a PS4. I play this game after work I‚Äôm not like a hardcore gamer.
---
All rise is slow, you will outgrow it over time though it's a good weapon for mid level. For 2H the faster swing speed is pretty much essential and you want instigators or anti armor if you don't want to do junkies or bloodied. With 2h the goal should be to one shot everything except the really big stuff otherwise you'll get swarmed fast. I also keep a weapon with a bonus to power attacks for tankier enemies so I can hit real hard.
---
Damage increase from demo expert is miniscule, and is subject to diminishing returns with each point. Even with 1 point it's like 6-8 damage added tops. 
---
Blocker is a must have for any build, so yeah, drop savior for it.
---
My camp is naturally hard to enter because it's on top of Seneca Rock and it has this FT bug that it spawns you below my camp, I hope these grinches will be caught in it haha.
---
For example, here's my build:

 no vats, no PA, energy focused. plasma flamer and E laser for rifles, E GP for sbq.
---
Can you repair it with workbenches
---
You‚Äôre right, yeah they are definitely different
---
I sold a lvl 1 tse bolt action for 25000 caps in one day in the vendor. So there is definitely a market for low level guns. Who wouldn't love to start fresh with a god roll.
---
Nope i cannot. I have tried everything i can think of. Even dropping to my mate after putting a mod on it/renaming it etc. Nothing is working! So frustrating :(
---
LOL, it‚Äôs not my job to figure out how to keep Bethesda in business.
---
So even your friend cannot repair it?
---
Correct! Tried trading, dropping to him, putting into container etc. No paint can be applied and it cannot be repaired.
---
Or just use B25 instead.
---
Wow awesome job.
---
Thanks for helping, but I'm a bit confused. The collectron station fits in a 1x1 enclosed room? What's the point of the front door?
---
Very strange indeed, you should try Bethesda support though they suck at matters related to items.
---
The Mr.Handy Buzzblade is killer with a bloodied unyielding build and a bloodied buzz. I rip through hordes of ghouls with ease.
---
Yea, i figured they would not reply, ask me to submit a ticket even though i have and then not respond to me. This is why i asked you lot, since y'all actually may be able to help.
---
I recall someone mentioning this bug ages ago on here.
---
I wonder if instigators will be negated by the reactive plates I have on my PA -- that usually does a tiny bit of damage to any nearby enemies.
---
As a n00b, I got small letters set from claiming Gorge Junkyard. Thought I'd died and gone to heaven. I know it's common, but it's not cheap...
---
Haha, you know that hadn't even occurred to me, I just might do that
---
Mine aren't even showing up. :/
---
Well, that is awesome. Great looking room for sure. Good job.
---
I‚Äôm not trolling but go off I guess. I never have issues with my melee weapons unless I forget to equip makeshift warrior
---
Just for you to see him. Also I've never done it without the door, so I cannot confirm that within a 1 by 1 room without a door, it's able to exit the station and collect presents
---
May sound crazy, but my current stealth/comando carries a B 10mm pistol (that I'm not speced for) as a secondary weapon.  Works great, and keeps me at range from enemies for less slap damage and disease!!  And people seem happy to give away 10mm ammo, so theres that.
---
Explosive adds what, 2o% damage?  So it would be 60% of that...not 60% of the entire weapon damage.
---
60% of the 20% explosive,  not the base weapon damage. Overall it is 32%
---
I think a Max demo does around 30-33% on explosive legendary.
---
FFR is 25%
---
Trade off is 5 perk points and some mobs like Queen have huge explosive resistance.
---
Totally agree with you OP, I don't know why they chose this route. Obviously our adventure mode characters are not actually killing each other like this, it makes no sense.
---
The Tenderizer is not *that* amazing, TBH. I mean, I'm glad I've got one, but I don't think I've ever used it.
---
Totally agreed with you, 100%   
---
We all knew frog legs was going to do exactly what it has done to the mode.
---
I would quit at that point. Solo play never looked so good.
---
How do you deploy it?  It only gives me the regular option.
---
I j remember the pain of not being able to craft a floor mat lmao
---
Oh, I see -- you build around the sides and back of the station, with the front of the station blocking the front door.
---
So you put all of this stuff in a container on a public server?
---
Ye so many impossible to get plans unless forking over 20k caps
---
I would have given you my level 25 faster fire rate ghoul slayers deep dish automatic gamma gun if I knew this.
---
Oh no what system do you play on?
---
Considering that the prydwen isn‚Äôt built until 180 years after fallout 76 starts I say that ‚Äúlater on‚Äù will never happen
---
well its an interesting strategy
---
You did a really nice job. Looks so cozy
---
Unless they finally patched it, you can move an entirely demolished camp 2 inches, and after you redeploy it, the entire thing is repaired. It's been a "bug/feature" forever now.
---
Im very curious about this too. I know they stated that all those quests will remain but I wonder if wastelanders will essentially be another "mode". 76 Year two or something.
---
This is how I understand it.
---
I tried this solo today. Of all the cavern maybe 2 or 3 ores spawned some scorched and only got 1 event scorchy on all the cavern. A real let down when i read people get 5-10 per run.
---
Also how do you mine them more than once a day?
---
50-60 what?
---
To be honest I've noticed my Weapons and Armour break much faster with the latest update. Can't say Thirst or Hunger is more of an issue since the update though.
---
Sure we have, she is in the intro!
---
What exactly are you asking? Are you trying to buy the plan and it isn't there? Trying to find the mod?
---
I think they meant explosive
---
Are you using a SSD?
---
No I actually have the plan, I am looking for the mod and wondering if it had showed up for anyone lately.
---
Crappy way to learn a lesson
---
You can get them until the 31st iirc
---
I'm doing that, I have 6 santatrons at the moment
---
Where on the map where you doing this?
---
The only times I‚Äôve ever done this it was with just ammo/junk (nothing super rare), I did it at Welch Station down in the Ash Heap (probably the least traveled area of the map), had both alts in the same spot, put the gear in a case, then rejoined the same server. 
---
But if you had two computers and two accounts (maybe I read that wrong), why didn‚Äôt you just do a direct trade?
---
Oh, I see now. It makes more sense once I realize it‚Äôs a typo.
---

---
Hope this will help, it's a lot easier when not hanging over the edge of a cliff
---
it's a great concept conan has snowy areas and having the heat meter is a really nice touch actually having to carry gear that compensates for the weather and heat your camp gives a better depth then having to binge eat and drink.
---
But I do realize that would be a patch in it's own further down the road.
---
You better not run you better not hide cause I‚Äôm coming to Jack your Santatron presents tonight. Dr skittle farts is coming to town
---
**IF I SHOUT REALLY LOUD MAYBE YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME**
---
‚ÄúRole playing‚Äù is the nerdiest possible excuse for simply being a dick.
---
Well, you can. Each day it shows you how much you need for each challenge, and that updates as you do matches.

---
The fix they did for it broke all legendary equipment so they rolled back the fix and are working on a solution.
---
Could be a combo of RNG and people farming for gifts.
---
They tried to fix it with the December patch, but when it went live, it broke most armor effects whenever you reloaded with any weapon. So, they reverted the fix until next year.
---
Except I can‚Äôt find any other games that have many reused assets like 76
---
Will you have enough money left over to pay your rent/feed your children?
