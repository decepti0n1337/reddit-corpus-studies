Thank you everyone at the studio for continuing to work hard on this game despite the critical reception. I used to be in the creative industry so I know the work can be grueling sometimes, especially when things fizzle at release. I personally love this game even with the bugs and I'm really glad to see all these improvements still coming down the line. I'm seeing the community being listened to and changes being made to help improve our experience. You guys are troopers and I'm sure the marketing end of this game has been really demoralizing. Thank you for keeping a candle lit for us fans. I wish I could buy you all a coffee and donuts.

Just press install and choose the directly that already has game files.

---
The launcher sometimes loses installation address after update. Happened to me. Attempting to i stall and selecting the path fixed it. 
---
find witch plan make 28 witch costumes sell to vendors
---
That means you have 450 weight worth of fusion cores? I'm guessing your stash is maxed? Does everyone on here have mules or is everyone just dropping shit all the time like me?
---
Do you have all of the perks for turrets, like Home Defense 3, Science 1, Fireproof 1, etc. And did you get the Flamethrower and Tesla traps from Abbies Bunker and have the switches plans? You can get really creative with them and build some great defenses if you spend a little time on it. Then you can save them as blueprints. Defenses can be really good.
---
It's only lagging behind if the new guns completely outclass the old ones, which would create a whole new slew of balance issues.
---
You don't do those events, anymore, before then you were impacting others.
---
And the 'high rof weapons doing fuck all' issue shouldn't be fixed with tse, it's a problem with the base numbers on high rof weapons in general and needs adressing, that said, I still have fun going around with the lmg from time to time and just ramboing it up
---
I hate cheaters myself but having them killed is going a bit too far.  Maybe ban them from the game instead.
---
Still no fix for the invisible players glitch? This is one of the worst, if not the worst, glitches on the game. 
---
It's a good game all they have to do is make thier servers more secure and the game will be less laggy. I mean just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's shit
---
&gt; Nuke around Flatwoods to try and force the alien ship to crash.
---
That would be fun, but I doubt they'll ever let us nuke the starting zone. 
---
Ok will do thanks
---
You're totally correct.  I'd certainly rather get some Chinese stealth armor  before Ashur's p.a. anyway.   The main point about my op was that I think it would be cool to craft new raider armor in 76.
---
I would love a raider subreddit 
---
3 level 100+ here, trying to join your game. Looks like it may be full.
---
Not even "Don't worry. I won't lash you to a cross like the rest of these degenerates" or "And who are you to come before me?"
---
Um.... this is Bethesda, not the Democratic Party.
---
It should keep track. It did for me but you need to press PAUSE before you close it 
---
I'm really disappointed this wasn't mentioned under updates to quests. It's driving me insane.
---
No recipe for Cramburger exists in game.
---
All this time the entire engine has been written in SQL, using a complex series of errors to trick our machines into displaying the right stuff. :P
---
 I get empathy EVRYTIME I farm mutations and it's the LAST one to go when I try and get rid of it. I cry every time. 
---
Quit duping?
---
Only prime spawns the SBQ
---
Frankly, I wish they'd come up with  a to delete all of the duped items.  I don't care how many people it pisses off.  The balance of the game is seriously broken due to too many people running around with TSE weapons. 
---
For one thing, think these weapons were clearly meant to be used on the queen.  But I see people using them at the uranium fever event and after nuke drops at white springs.  If you have the most powerful weapon in the game, it should be used on the most powerful enemy, not to farm more legendary weapons. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I really don't get it. 
---
I’d rather have that one raider power armor and just have whatever mods you add to it actually show up (eg. calibrated shocks, core assembly etc). Same with the other suits so that it adds more variety to all of the power armour players
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/tranquility-tech-3
---
That's not what this implies bud
---
Was a level 3 when I was running around and a scorch beast had trapped me until I had logged out, it sucks.
---
I don’t think he’s online
---
Long story short, I lost my junk at WS because a nuke fell on my head. Went back to farm some 20-30 glowers to make myself feel better. Had no PA and no hazmat. So I popped some 20 radaways/stims until I ran out completely and just said fuck it because I still had to loot the bodies.
---
After dying and respawning in Flatwoods I realized that my radiation dmg had healed somewhat so I jumped off a cliff right next to my camp to test the theory rather than going to farm ghouls or containers for radaway. 10 cliff jumps later and I was clear of any radiation dmg.
---
Kinda glad I got to abuse this once before it was patched. (I have yet to intentionally abuse any other glitches to this point. And I don't feel too bad because I used my own ability to discover this and didn't hear it from some damn youtuber.)
---
All in all though, this is all fantastic news.
---
I thought in the patch notes they said they fixed duping.
---
The game's economy is most likely(ie should be) built around the assumption that you will hit the 1400 vendor cap each day.  Doesn't matter how you do it really.
---
Now, duping nuka cola milions of times?  That definitely affects the economy.
---
It really isn't. Just because we can keep gaining levels... you don't get anything for it except for another level. your SPECIAL points are the same, weapons only max at 50, PA only maxes at 50.  
---
  
---
The game right now is intended for 50.
---
Hot mics should never be a default. Ever.
---
I've gone past AFK people in other games and clearly heard porn coming from their motionless body. I've heard arguments between people. And so on and so on.
---
Should you be taking away people's right to privacy because some executive thought always on mics was a good idea? Some people don't even realize they have mics built into laptops, webcams, or some other periphery.
---
I'm not saying you care too much, I'm just complaining about how similar a lot of posts on this sub are, and I've never understood when people post edits complaining abt downvotes
---
So your argument is that people who don’t play the way you like suck at this game? So compelling and decisive.
---
Just because someone doesn’t have a solution doesn’t mean they can’t recognize when the status quo isn’t working.
---
The stash will be in a good spot when most players feel their decisions on what to pick up or store are tactical/strategic, right now we just feel constrained.
---
But since you look down on other players not playing your way, a better question is why are you so bothered by there being another stash increase?
---
The only effect on you is having more empty space in your stash.
---
I don't think you should get XP without tagging, but loot should be there for anyone that's in the area. Most high level (50+) players aren't there for the XP, they're trying to find that elusive 3* whatever to complete their build.
---
I've had a few of those today. 
---
Sweet that Bobby pins weight very little now. Not sweet however, that after spending 30 minutes building poseidon power station to power the fusion core gen, I get hit with an infinite loading screen  when I try to enter the power plant through the door right next to the FC gen.... So that's a piss off, there goes alot of wasted mats. 
---
There are many possibilities that might cause incorrect data - many of which don't involve whatever database/ datastore is in use at all.  I won't go into that. 
---
In regards to "restoring" an item - the instance of that item is probably not restored from any database backup.  Instead,  it's highly likely that a new instance of the object is created and associated to the player.
---
I agree on the tools thing.  If I'm correct and they don't restore items as a matter of policy then no tools are needed. 
---
That's the point, I wasnt complaining. Just stating an obvious fact 
---
I've had this happen a lot lately actually. Fighting people for loot on the same corpse.
---
There's no fix, it's not a bug. They said in the december 11 patch notes this was intended
---
&gt; Heavy Gunner: No longer incorrectly benefits the Auto Grenade Launcher.
---
Some arsehole killed my team in a nuke zone several times (We were in pacifist). I lost over 120 caps each time. Ended up quitting because I was being punished for not fighting back.
---
I ran in yesterday with 3 people in PA using their TSE’s during this event. I was running around like a madman trying to get a kill but nothin.
---
Well after the update it take up to two minutes for me to connect to a server, then the server is still laggy and I still get disconnected after about 20 minutes of gameplay . I've been trying so hard to enjoy the game and I've been supporting Bethesda but I cant keep hoping. Every update has said it has enhanced performance and stability but I haven't seen it yet... Bethesda I love you but I'm beginning to feel our relationship is going south. Maybe I should just wait another month for the next update and try again... 
---
I had a sneak build with an instigating six crank laser musket. I loved that thing.
---
Are you sure about the ore thing? I can swear grafton steel gives me straight steel scrap.
---
All I know is the Alien gear, and the Nuka paint. If you find any more, be sure to post a PSA because those were fantastic hunts. 
---
That reminds of Team Fortress 2. The Demo man got a melee weapon that was a stick grenade and it would explode on contract, damaging you and the target.
---
I can craft Tesla Rifles. If you are on Xbox and have the mats I can build you a base model. It won't have legendary effects, but if you're just looking to tag shit it doesn't really matter.
---
I probably missed this one but I’ll join anytime in the future Angellina_jolie 
---
&gt;no vision or plans for the long term future.
---
Sounds like everyone who said they were never going to buy from Bethesda again, which isn't most of this subreddit.
---
What did I miss? Are all the robots gone from Whitesprings? 
---
To throw in on this - the old Anarchy Online game was propelled by its stat system. Storyline is lacking, as with most MMOs. 
---
But when you could freeze XP, and the PvP mechanics fell into place - you needed to have alts to PvP properly. A competition between low levels? Shit, how tough can a lower level be? 
---
The game had both a level progression and many level caps - meaning that there was a lot of incentive to gear up a lowbie, and start new alts.
---
Honestly this game needs that. It should have had an old school skill system too (Armour requires SPECIAL, weapons and gear require skills)
---
Each bullet seems to load quite a bit faster than before though...
---
How about, "I'd also like to have...."  DLC that shit.
---
??? I literally just looked no more than 5 minutes ago. On Xbox if you put 1 20% junk it moves junk to 90% weight reduction.   
---
The only reduction that currently stacks with perks is the weapon weight reduction which is additive to the perk cards you have making a 50 cal with heavy barrel 0.21 pounds. 
---
What you had to go to a smelting factory somewhere on the map?
---
Damn dupers!!! Oh wait.. Who will we blame now? Dupers!!!!!! they are still the reason.
---
Im actually on PS4. It's honestly rare for me but I wanted to make sure people realized they weren't just shutting off PVP.
---
I'm sure they will eventually. 
---
ah of course, skeleton. ill look into that one.
---
It still makes me sad that that's how it is.
---
Benny was just Chandler Bing. No matter what you did, he was still Chandler. 
---
I've also found that when using a controller (I have no clue how to do this with a mouse/keyboard) pressing Left Trigger will "test" the spot with very little degradation (mind you, there's still some, just not as much.)
---
I used to get 3 or 4 levels a run
---
i prefer x-01 tbh
---
You can use Excavator armor for twice the yield, helps some.
---
I don’t know, it’s hard to tell if they disintegrate less because weapons only lose condition if a hit actually hits and the chaos of fights makes that hard to determine.
---
What I can tell you is that it lasts long enough that I’d regularly use it in bursts if crystals weren’t hard to come by for repairs.
---
I love FO76. Been playing it non-stop and having friends that I can play with consistently and interacting with the marketplace has been great.
---
This community is unfortunately pretty toxic, doesn't accept dissenting opinions, and really lacks any sort of introspection. You can claim that r/Fallout are the old conservative faction, but chances are they wouldn't be if the FO76 loyalists didn't encourage such bipolar behavior. 
---
This seems like the most useless patch. Why do you all carry so many? I usually sell any above 10 I have. I've never run out.
---
If you fast travel a lot it adds up fast. Travel agent perk helps a bit. 
---
If you joined their party you set yourself up mate
---
All I'm seeing is a bunch of dumb shit with maybe 10 actual good fixes. "150!!!!!." Yeah 130 trash fixes. Foh man we still blue screen, we still disconnect, in 3 hours YouTube will have a dozen dupe videos. Tf you nerf nukes for? Why do you add shit in with these patch notes nonone asks for? "Legendary hunting rifles wooooo!!!!." Bro we have TSE everything no one wants a damn trashy ass hunting rifle.
---
After using for awhile I came to the same conclusion and got x01
---
They can't rebalance the game while the dupe bug exists.  If they tone down explosive(for example), the dupers will just go on another duping spree duping the new best thing, lagging the shit out of the servers again.
---
Did you actually read the article or just frantically google EVE SQL? You know that's years outdated right? And it doesn't actually prove your point, because it doesn't show the mapping of the TQ nodes.   
---
But of course, you wouldn't know any of that, because you haven't been playing EVE for over a decade, and seen just how poorly it runs.   
---
No, this is nothing to do with that, it's just trying to join a game....server hopping for kit. Everyone's a duper hey..  :-)
---
I'm upset about it, I usually check the Atom Shop each playthrough, but I forgot once-- the one time they release the best paint job. :(
---
If the target is full health, the first shot will deal flat double damage. This includes sneak and all perks, everything. As long as you don't have a receiver on your Handmade that gives it AUTOMATIC fire, then it will benefit solely from Rifleman perk cards. 
---
Wasn't it intended? They said it no longer counts as a heavy weapon in one of the december updates.
---
Like I said only dlc will decide that all the other monsters and adds is fine to blown away with a shotty but what if there’s a boss we
---
Get where you have to target a precise shot on the enemy at the exact moment and time like a heavy armoured hermit crab boss who’s body is a rail way carriage rather then half a bus ? Targeting precise parts will stop it dropping insane damage in your team 
---
We don’t know yet all I’m saying is once bigger and harder bosses are created those guns will only

this has been suggested many times..doubt they'll do it.

4 hours 3 disconnects so it's the same... i hear there's a game indi called "NO man sky" sounds cool  
---
Question about this - I've occasionally picked up a 10 cap bounty by accidentally damaging a (owned?) generator on the back side of Grafton Steel while farming Mutants there for steel. It happened often enough that i turned on Pacifist. So far so good, no bounties since.   
---
But last night I capped the workshop at Lakeside. During defense #2, I get 4 waves of Dogs. Unfortunately, someone had a camp in the middle of the dry lake, so wave # 2 aggroed to HIS base, and the dogs weren't coming in to my area. I had crap weapons (level 9 at the time), so I'm trying to snipe these dogs from half-way across the dry lake with an open sighted 10mm pistol. And they are all clustered around his 4 water purifiers, and a ton of corn he planted. Because I was in a workshop, does that mean I really DID have to avoid hitting his stuff to not pick up a bounty, or was the workshop actually putting me in "legit" mode of PVP against HIS camp?   
---
 I don't seem to have picked up a bounty, but I really don't know if I succeeded in avoiding hitting his camp, which I WAS trying to avoid, because I'd forgotten that I'd turn on pacifist, but didn't realize that workshop capping might have turned it off.   
---
Man, this onion has a lot of layers... ;)
---
I greatly appreciate that but unfortunately I'm on PS4
---
Thank you though.  I truly appreciate the offer!
---
Getting 100+ bobble heads sounds like exactly the kind of thing I'd do, and I don't dupe. I just don't use bobble heads either. 
---
The Dragon is a variation on the Blackpowder rifle isn't it?
---
Can't do shit they have no way of tracking characters or items. 
---
I'm mostly melee, but I do the same thing. If I'm alone I use the Instigating +40 power damage war drum to 1 shot them, but once other people show up I switch the Mr Handy Blade and just run through the crowd nicking all the bad guys.
---
No there was a bug which made whitesprings have fucktons of robots, they fixed the big today and that's why op said it was lonely 
---
Thanks equipping it now
---
Thanks for the collective response unlike someone else who has been responding lol. 
---
The character loading has to tie into the database or at the very least the netcode to some degree. 
---
Unless it is the client loading the last saved character on the server or a corrupted entry. 
---
Either way it comes down to horrid support especially in the fact of a deleted character and lack of transparency to the server side of things.
---
I'd love to believe your story but we all know energy weapons are less useful than the squirt gun in FO4. 
---
/s
---
Oh man that made me lol
---
Raiding, m8.
---
Tell you hwat, find the 100+ players, stash your junk and go after them with a machete. When they kill you, come back and gank them - then make your getaway.
---
Got 200 screws off one of them. Filled up my stash after three kills!
---
I figured it had to do with the dude who was trying to do a time travel experiment there
---
Bruh, it swings both ways.  
---
I’m tired of the community of this game because you can’t even have a valid concern or criticism of this game without people defending it and calling you a “bandwagoner” and acting like they’re superior to you because “I’ve never had any issues so you’re full of bullshit”.  
---
A lot of problems that half of the community had and that the game’s defenders claimed were just “made up outrage” *just got patched*.  
---
If you can’t step back and genuinely acknowledge the faults in the game and the way the development has been handled, and feel the need to talk down to everybody who isn’t enjoying their experience; you’re no better than the people who waste their time constantly attacking the game.
---
What? There is nothing wrong with being spammed to death by their “Sonic Booms” that has impeccable aim that make sharpshooter blush. 
---
What I love is when a scorched beast attacks. And you get hit with a nonstop barrage of sonic booms. 
---
Or you go to your camp to see 3 scorched beasts attacking your camp and see you and spam their attacks. 
---
They will buy Purified water. 5 caps each with the Barter perk.
---
I don't approve of it either.  
---
I haven't had an issue but a couple of times. I simply server hopped or ignored them.  
---
Since every player is out of 76, it does NOT mean they are going to follow the main quest and stick to it. In fact, anyone could make their char say "F it. I was stuck underground for 25 years with those people' or were born inside. The freedom might make them become raiders or as you say 'a dick' to other players. It's quite reasonable and realistic.  
---
How would you deal with a person like that IRL? Exactly. Be glad they made repairing cheap or it would take forever.
---
I know right? there's no point to bobbleheads and magazines now because they aren't meant to be collected, and if you do collect them you're punished because there goes a pound per bobblehead and a 10th of a pound per mag.
---
I wish they just debuffed the mags/bobbleheads, made the effects permanent, maybe give them specific locations (lord knows the map is big enough,) and then made them weightless so you aren't punished for collecting.
---
How the fuck is that outdated? Are you seriously delusional? So you're telling me they made a more recent major change without telling anyone? You're coming up with excuses.
---
What part of the SPECIAL does the barter belong to?
---
Kill the queen, other scorchbeasts, farm the fissures and you'll find Ultracite no problem. As far as the armor being worth it...maybe? Really it's less of the overall protection and more of what mods you can put on the armor. Like my X01 has targeting hud and stealth boy which help with my sniper build. 
---
Thanks, gonna invest in it rn.
---
i have picture proof...just won't let me attach it here for whatever reason.

Super Mutants have the highest drop rate for caps. It was actually nerfed in the Dec 11 patch
---
What they are saying is this game is not geared to story and npc interaction. The game is geared to you playing with other players and doing whatever makes you happy. The quests are baseline just to guide you through some of the areas. Plus the game is still in the fixing the bug stage. Once it’s out of that it’s all new content driven probably towards what the gentlemen above said. It’s not a single player game and is difficult to compare to one. In your point of view it has shortcomings because your comparing it like it’s a single player game. If you are saying it’s buggy and glitchy and those are its shortcomings then you better compare it to when all the others first came out and the buggy mess they were. I couldn’t even play NV for two months when it came out. 
---
Given the Fallout 4 workshop DLC, I hope those contraptions come after player vending.   
---
This way you can load raw material into a hopper and have certain items (screws, ammo, weapons) instantly available at your player vending machine.
---
rifle. i think

I tried it initially without power armor, then switched when I became overecombered. Caught a disease just before then.

What interested me was that there appeared to be a very developed area down below the water. I fout it while trying to find something that would allow me to scrap a bunch of mole miner gauntlets, and make my load more bearable.

---
car hinge? I’m not sure I understand.
---
I am talking about people that are not involved in the game but yet take their time to bring it down.
---
You are saying I am talking down people who bring feedback.
---
Have you actually understood the meaning of my post?
---
I do something similar. I have a furious faster fire rate Gatling Plasma strictly for scorch beasts. I have a Furious Explosive Gatling Laser for regular enemies. Repair both to 200% and use gunsmith and luck of the draw. So probably repair 5 times a day on the Laser, Twice on the Plasma. Plasma would need more frequent repair if I used it on anything but scorch beasts 
---
The last sentence totally made this post worth it :)

---
Go to winterspring and pick up everything you can. Coat hangers in the clothes stores, vases all around the place, ashtrays in sitting area, soap in spa area. All sells for 1 cap each.
---
Also as mentioned get the witch costume or the skeleton costume. I have the skeleton costume and lately I've been maxing out caps daily. From memory 5 plastic and 1 or 2 cloth to make and they se l for 31 caps or if you use grape mentats that goes up to 50 caps per costume. 24 costumes gives you 1200 caps which is all the vendors except for Grahnn who I don't worry about due to being difficult to find.
---
Good source of plastic is the crazy cat lady house which you can find via google and not far from that is Morgantown High School which has alot of plastic plates and pumpkins in the gym and cafeteria.
---
Thank you so much it is going to be my new favorite gun when I level up

I'm assuming this will come eventually, but Bethesda needs to fix the game

Yup, it’s been mentioned.

Thanks, but I'm not quite sure what you mean? Do you mean wear excavator armour when I go farming? Is it because of the "Ore Sniffing technology" I found a reference to?
---
I have this and also got a "excavator headlamp" when there is only the standard headlamp.
---
Bethesda loves power armor and the BOS. 
---
thats it.

What would you mount for grafton monster? He has no head!
---
Nah, I don't think that equipment gap between pve and pvp should be widened.

You'll just end up with pvers who never bothered grinding for pvp gear in an uphill battle against pvpers in pvp rated gear.

Thank you a hell of a lot

Add me on discord @ AtomicMilkMan#6885 if ur up for some play.

Lets keep blaming the dupers.. DAMN DUPERS!!! Well my work here is done.

Also what do the grape mentats do?

I hear you, but I kinda like having a rare paint job! Also, I didn't buy it either, there's a glitch to trade Atom paints...

Me either! Until recently I lost more than I gained whenever I went to Whitespring.
---
A lot of fun he says... insert kids screaming in your ear every 3 seconds. SKREEEEEEEE! I have to mute monster mash every time.
---
I slept on it as a viable perk card, on a whim after L60 I picked it up, in a nuke zone I maybe use 2 or 3 Grape Colas. Also, Grape Nuka does not remove mutation, so a low level player can keep their mutations since today's update nerfed dying to remove rads.
---
Like the other guy said; they've never weighed that much in previous fallout titles. Why change them for this game? They ended up changing them back in the end anyways
---
In the example you provided, shooting multiple exploding bullets at your target as fast as possible will be the best answer.  The way the game is set up, the ability to shoot more explosive bullets is going to be much better than a flat damage increase provided by a higher level item.
---
&gt;but once newer and higher level guns are available it will make the old ones over encumbering rubbish
---
My entire point is that this isn't inherently true given how out of whack existing TSE weapons are compared to their non-legendary variants.
---
Is there really? If you happen to know it, let me know. 
---
Ty
---
&gt; So your argument is that people who don’t play the way you like suck at this game? So compelling and decisive.

Oh man you just beat up that strawman so good, kiddo

Every region has a level range that enemies can scale to. If you can't handle level 68 enemies, don't build in regions that scale that high. You did this to yourself
---
If you initiate a trade with someone and they dont accept then you cant see their inventory.  Well on console, if you initiate a trade and push in R3 twice it will bring up that person's entire inventory without them accepting.  Thus giving you the ability to see what they have equipped and what weapons they can use against you. 
---
Yes, if you check the excavator arms or legs it will state that it gives 2x yeild on all ores gathered while equipped.
---
&gt;The servers haven't changed since that article was posted and it was 2016. Did you even read it you deluded moron?
---
100% false.  Literally every word of your statement is a lie.
---
So we are still missing a bunch of camo skins, a bunch of vault tec skins, a hammer skin, a gauss rifle skin, one or two fat man skins, a few laser rifle skins, a pickaxe skin, and two revolver skins...it's already bad enough these are locked to a specific weapon, but we are barely even getting any weapon skins

Here's my first attempt at posting!  What do you think?

Thank you!

I'll try it but I'll probably be trying out x01 too.

Those are called course meals, such as 3-course meals, etc. And there are high-end places that charge like $60 for a really tiny steak or meal. 
---
So your example is like.... EXACTLY what people do and the stand for it and they pay more for it. 
---
And those places can also be super exclusive on top of it to boot. So..... yeah.
---
Personally, I would have rather them do something with a monthly payment (see FFXIV) with optional store items. I don't really care if some of it costs $30 but it better a mount and not just a paint or something stupid (also see FFXIV). 
---
There's a lot of ways they could have done it better but it seems like they attempted to make a bunch of compromises, probably felt they shouldn't do the same as ESO, etc. Honestly, this would've worked better but people would've complained no matter what they did. It was never going to be a Fallout Story game and... people just weren't gonna be happy. Either way, I agree but also disagree and imma go off and exist for a bit

Now read this article written in 2017.

This literally just happened to me like half an hour ago.

will need to double-check a thing tomorrow then :D

I was just wanted to find out what they have to say

It’s why I started locking my Camp while I’m inside. They’ll come in and try to initiate. They’ll be in pacifist at first and just annoy the F out of you trying to get you to engage. It will go on until you engage or leave server. Now they go wanted for picking the lock. Sorry other players. I built you a workbench, stash and cook station outside.

Dood already nailed it.  if you picked it up in January you don't get it I'm sorry fellow survivor.  Had to play in 2018. It's been the one mea culpa since we shelled out for a game that plummeted in price frighteningly quickly
---
...so even playing Fallout 76 for hundreds of hours doesn’t validate any criticisms you have of the game?
---
If anything, BOS is the only armor that should HELP in PA.  But in general, underarmor should be changed to still offer buffs in PA, IMO.

I'd think an arm like the mirelurks or even a full stuffed Grafton of they could make it fit.

Also if your dumbass actually read the articles you'd see it is used for game data.

i have 300 caps, but theyre all yours if you want
---
I haven't played for a couple of weeks at least.

Want to play, but cannot be bothered at the same time.

Make it so that vendors go hostile on anyone with a duped item in inventory.

That continues my point and examples of

&gt; It's an MMORPG less than 6 months after release. 
---
Anarchy had so many bugs in pretty much every aspect of the game and account that it took Funcom 6 months just to make it playable and they had to give out free copies just to get subscribers. It was the entire basis of "Free Trial" MMO mechanics lol.

I’m online right now

Almost done with launch prep

GT?

Let's just see what actually possible before we go off the rails theorizing what should be done. I want the world to be nothing but frickin sunshine and rainbows, but it doesn't mean I get to quit my job based on some idle hope

&gt; Legendary Death Claw/Power Fist for my Melee
---
Until they fix the stupid "you can't equip that weapon in power armor" shit there's almost no reason to go after one of those unless you're running a mutation heavy hazmat build.
---
You can win. Just have to play smart and get better items. I was fighting 3+ people one time and I died a lot and lost a lot of caps (500+ probably) but I did get them a few times and I learned a little more from the experience. You can't get better at something unless you practice and experience it. So take on those fights against the odds. Lose your caps. Learn from it and get better at fighting back. When you crouch you are invisible on the map. So use stealth and guerrilla tactics. So you can take a position and shoot at them if you use guns. Or wait for them to get close to you and ambush them if you're melee. Chameleon armor helps in this kind of situation also.
---
Quantums give a ridiculous amount of AP. I pop those if I want to go full auto VATS. I have a real shitty but kinda fun build where I just pop one of those and go Gun-fu on everything in sight with a machine pistol.
---
Okay, I'll see if that will work for me. Also yes I'm on ps4. 
---
I miss them too. Especially when 3 scorchbeasts spawn at once lol 
---
I have Server problems since the damn Patch. They always manage to break something during a Patch.
---
Nah, I’m still here.  
---
Major news outlets are unreliable sources for objective feedback on the game, so the only way I’ll know if/when the game gets good is through this subreddit.  
---
If/when that happens I might pick it up again.
---
Been using Cola Nut to maintain AP for semi-permanent jetpacking (along with bird bones), though just found a recipe for Sunshine Oil that will do a better job.
---
Where is your camp?
---
Uneekxsole
---
I opened the notes earlier to see what they fixed. Read through one by one, each time thinking "Oh good. Nice. Ok good". Even if I need a bit more ballistic finer than before haha
---
I kept scrolling and reading. Scrolling. Scrolling. Was like ok what on earth? How long is this list?? If I'm honest I stopped reading about 2 thirds though because it was just so much.
---
So glad they are still working on the game.
---
No you miss understood, I’m a big gun / PA guy.
---
Every big gun is viable for me, no perk difference, but they weigh so damn much I couldn’t collect them sans a couple really worth using because of the weight.
---
With Bear Arms that changed to where I now have all of them except the Junk Jet but I can’t store them to use a different perk(s) because they weigh too much. 
---
Saying that I need to make new characters means making the exact same build multiple times in a game where the story can’t be changed with different options, where there’s no sharing of plans at all nor a way to transfer items to a new charscter without a friend.
---
This is the heart of the problem - there are mutliple viable weapons and armors for every play style but limited stash means you can only pick a small handful. And that’s not due to game design but tech limitations. 
---
Oh, I've wanted to play but I moved and they took their sweet time installing our internet.
---
Yup, all the way inside at the command center.  Tried all 3 of the SigInt terminals in there.
---
Ooooh grafton fist!
---
Terrible Shotgun also had one of the worst spreads in the game.
---
(Not trying to sound like you don’t know what you’re doing, just thinking of some scraps le things that some people might miss)
---
I know there’s those powerable posters you can scrap, and many trash cans you cannot...  I assume you got rid of all the cars/trucks.  Many tables, chairs, lockers, shelves etc. are removable too.  Also there’s a lot of stuff on the roof, though not 40% of the budget.  Could you tell if someone else built on it before you?  There might be a stupid number of lvl 4 turrets tucked around atop roofs and corners, especially if they had marsupial and wanted to build up.
---
Hope I could help some!
---
I think he was talking about the legendary perk that reduces a guns weight by 90% thus the 20lb fatman get reduced to 2lbs. 
---
Any major changes? 
---
Yeah, but have you ever seen an armada of froobs used properly?
---
I do think FO76 should have gone that way tbh, maybe in the future. That's just because of how much fun it is to use froobs against sloobs. 
---
I can't remember the exact steps but it involves an unowned power armor frame and initially unpainted pieces.
---
Lots of ways to earn caps by selling to vendors, start by maxing out the hard bargain perk card and the one that lets you fast travel 30% cheaper. Build a camp with 8 of the medium water purifiers, they hold up to 3 each purified water and passively replenish. Collect junk like crazy, make sure to load up on plastic. Bulk that junk and sell it, bulk the plastic and sell it. Get the perk card that lets you find extra chems in containers. I get so many chems I'm constantly selling them off from just normal play. Wherever the next good place to farm legendaries is, you're bound to end up with a ton of crap ones you could sell for good caps.

That's pretty weird... either way, not risking it at this point.

The team is aware of this suggestion
---
:D 
---
Build as many large purifier as you can and sell them to vendors with hard bargain. Or are you already maxed out on those every day? If so, what are you spending your caps on? 
---
&gt; Game crashed

shocker!  I am shocked.

I'm too missing on these lasers, I've like them in every one so far and now sudden they aren't good any longer?

Try my friends in the post

Yesterday while chopping down some ghouls in whitesprings I managed to kill another player who ran in front of me, while I had pacifist on. Proceeded to become wanted and was immediately killed by other players around who then stole all my shit. I'm convinced that I hit the guy as a ghouls killed him and it somehow registered as my damage?
---
Yeah some guy popped up and chased me with a buzz blade last night. I eventually just stopped and let him kill me; then he stimmed me back and came after me again. 
---
I really don’t care if someone wants to steal my junk or whatever but I’ve got a limited amount of time to play and people who try to slap me into pvp are not gonna get what they want. 
---
They tell on themselves via YouTube confessions.  Ban their accounts.
---
He might've thought you were just dropping them because you didn't want them. 
---
Although I've had items just disappear when I dropped them from someone, or someone dropped them for me, so that can happen too.
---
Trading it definitely the safer way, even if it is an annoying system.
---
Yeah i did gut his friend instantly with my vampire meat hook. Was satisfying by itself, but of course with TSE you don't have any chance. Especially if you don't have any yourself. 
---
Without perks the gatling plasma cant even make it through 1 full mag before breaking. I've got a 3 star gat plasma that sits in my storage because it's about the coolest drop I've gotten, I've used it twice..
---
That's so weird. Interesting though thanks.
---
I could see trying to collect 1 of each (even though you can't display them), but why on earth would anyone want to waste 100lbs of their stash weight on bobbleheads?
---
You're right but like I said I was really curious about what they have to say
---
Was north of the powerstation above Watoga.
---
r/fo76bazaar

It's a room in Bethesda games where they store every item that exists within the games code weather u can obtain it through legit gameplay or not

Yup I'm getting that too
---
I had more trouble with a level 50 Behemoth than with all those Ghouls.
---
Throw in some *** Legendary Ancient Behemoth pls
---
Congrats. No one cares.
---
you smoke entirely too much dope
---
I sincerely hope that those items especially are deleted and there are actual financial repercussions level through PayPal against the sellers.
---
Ah servers full, thanks anyway
---
The deal is that im not sad just about fallout 76. Im frusterated that we get the same thing out of bethesda every time. Bugs on bugs, a first experience that is always marred by that feeling, then finally a satisfiable level sometime around the time where the product has reached its business maturity and im looking foe the next thing.
---
When a game is released, i just want to say Mr. Howards famous line "it just works". Part of my first initial experience shouldnt be fighting bugs and waiting dor content from a top level company. When i get the game, i should just be able to get it and experience it like a designers intent dictates.
---
That isnt a conservative thought. Thats progressive.
---
Oh well. Keep checking the Watoga Train Station and Super Duper mart. I found plans for it at one of those two places.
---
Good luck!
---
The majority of F76 players are pretty friendly and helpful, but unfortunately there will always be assholes out there. 
---
Hopefully someone nukes his base. 
---
I am getting weird loading screens, but I am also getting faster load times. It seems a bit artificial though since I'm not fully loaded into the world, I can't open my pip boy, and can't interact with anything.
---
I would say thanks for listening but the only massive issue I saw resolved was the Bobby pin weight. We are talking about 10’s of thousand of posts and comments for the removal of dupers and the ability to track plans we already own/notice in camp stating what plan unlock what in camps. Those are the 2 biggest issues I have seen yet they mention nothing about them again. 
---
Refer to above comments 
---
Sweet we're in. Thanks.
---
Do you know anyone who can do this? Or could you try it yourself and/or help me out with doing it? 
---
This seems to be caused by having a second set of legendary armor in your inventory,  a left leg in your case. Try stashing it and see if it stops doing that.
---
This ^ it's up north. 
---
I wouldn't mind some PvP if it wouldn't be nigh impossible to win against TSE weapons. Especially if you do not have any yourself. I did gut his friends quite nice though with my Meathook. Died like a wet sack. His friend tho of course oneshot me with his... whatever it was.
---
I never wanted to get free XP or loot. I justed wanted to get to the vendors &amp; complete the blade of Bastet quest. I would get hammered by the Scorchbeast going in and leaving, and get slaughtered by the lvl 68 ghouls &amp; high lvl Deathclaws while I was there. There were a few times when EVERYTHING was hostile! I must have accidentally hit one of the Whitespring robots because nowhere was safe.
---
I like the idea of not being able to fast travel past a certain cap limit; it would definitely cut down on the griefers out there.
---
Very mature behaviour 
---
Ohh you're saying you did a backflip off the top of the Gym but everyone but you was absent from school that day and the police said they'd kick you out of the FBI if you ever tried to do it a second time?
---
The animation is fixed? works fine for me..
---
Damn I expected you to say whitesprings. Lots of people destroy camps there because someone "took" their spot. Sorry dude. 
---
Just a heads up, I attempt d to make a post like this a few days ago. Even went far enough as to post each youtubers name that did the glitch themselves on video and linked out to each one.
---
Then someone suggested I read the sub rules and Reddit rules in general. Stuff like this can get u banned man. It sucks but it can be considered a “witch hunt”.
---
I think these people should pay. I think posting video evidence of yourself doing the glitch should have you account shut down sooo fast. But that’s not the way it works apparently. Or at least this isn’t the platform to try to get it done. Sorry mate. This drives me crazy as well.
---
P.s I didn't get into dev room
---
Exactly what im doing. 
---
Have twisted muscles, talons, and a bunch of others already. 
---
Waiting on my regen and kangaroo hops next.
---
Until I can use fist weapons in power armor I'm not interested in using PA on my melee build. That will be for all my gun using builds.
---
Yeah, I don't believe that for one minute. Your character stats, items, weapons, armor, etc. pp. are stored in a database, like a save file only it's not client side, it's server side. If Bethesda doesn't have the tools to check those they are beyond incompetent.
---
This, boot every last one of them, forever. We do not need these people in the game. 
---
others have given better descriptions on where to find it. I choose not to upload anything from my xbox live acct as I like to keep that annonymous.
---
whitesprings guys had animal heads on?
---
Same here as I'm using Rifleman perks for automatic right now.. Mine is a 3 star level 50 that also has better vats accuracy and lower vats cost,  so I've been using it as an automatic with a high luck VATS build. May have to put on a semi-auto receiver until I can get the Commando perk cards. 
---
But they're seeking their duped stuff on ebay.. Probably coming out ahead on the money front. 
---
If only they had people on staff who were adept at *programming* such tools, they could *program* a new tool for that purpose.
---
We can call this person's job *software writer*.
---
It's a 45% damage reduction at max rank, which is helpful, but far from "Immunity to Explosives" as OP put it.
---
Oh i do not mind it myself if people use my workbench or anything. Heck i even do not even lock up my extractor in future if someone needs stuff since my stash is flooded with mats. But i just say like usually. Be nice or be gone.
---
I bought the game (on sale a week after release) and for the most part enjoyed what I played. Just under 100hrs playtime, just under lvl 100.  
---
But the game is massively flawed, development is slow and the Reddit community is insanely toxic (ironically compared to in-game community who are great).  
---
I’ve got other (better) games competing for my time, and I’m not going to waste my breath trying to provide feedback to make the game better any more when it seems that half of the community seems to think the game is Michelangelo’s Magnum Opus.
---
Fuckthat, give them autogrenade launchers
---
I feel like you don’t understand the whole fallout genre then.
---
Actually yea I forgot about that.  That is completely awful.
---
Curious about what a legendary pair of binoculars would be like..I want a legendary drill...just have it be like a melee thing and the animation is just you totally grab the targets head and drill into the temple while you hear the grinding from going through the bone and the blood splattering everywhere, then you've got to basically yank it out of their head....
---
it'd be so dope.
---
Ultracite has close to a hundred more physical DR than X-01 but lower energy/rad resistance.  I haven’t looked at them extensively, but there might be some mods that help even more with damage mitigation.  Also, some people just really like the look I guess
---
Yup I ended up just buying serums after spending hours farming
---
Haha, Google it or something. I'm sure my friend wasnt the first to discover its possible, he doesnt even play as much as me.
---
TSE weapons make this a danger for even higher level characters, someone was hitting me for about a 20th of my bar with a TSE. Lucky they were dumb enough to keep doing it even when I started running around White Springs bots. I was able to just walk inside while the bots got my back.
---
This sounds awesome! I'm not a PVP person, but I would consider this... I'm on XB1, though.
---
Maybe he doesn't pvp? Also maybe he doesn't trade?  Alot of people play this game without interacting with people.  In ways it still can be played solo.  I played the game solo for a long time.  My first fallout game and well I just jumped into it.  Met people down the road way later but I was established by then.
---
I'm currently looking for a fix to this bug found your comment - did you ever find a solution?
---
oh hey this post again how exciting
---
this stupid forum is like a broken record
---
I'd get DC's every now and then also, but these game crashes/freezes are way more annoying than just rejoining a lobby.
---
What is the "true power" of the lever action rifle?  I've seen where the plans have been sought after and people seem to covet the TSE version, but isn't the .308 sniper or even a good Handmade modded for sniper a better choice?  Apart from having a fondness for the gun in real life or maybe some character role-playing, is there any reason to use the lever action in game?

Use t60 or t51

Good job! Time to get back into the game after a month long break.

Like yeah, that'd be something. At least then I could check what I do have. As is I'm trying to use a spreadsheet and piece together what I've already learned.

u/wildstarz has a great screenshot that should help.

A course meal would be anything else from Bethesda but this game. (Base game then full DLC’s) but Fallout 76 is one single order of Ruby Tuesday steak torn up and served bite by bite.

You've just summed up reddit and twitter both,  in one simple statement.

Don't get me wrong, the writing and story was great. And I liked the mechanical improvements, like the companion wheel. But the game was **SO. FUCKING. BORING.**
---
You spend a few minutes with some (mostly) great dialogue interactions or cut scenes, but then have to spend countless hours in the most aesthetically-dry, visually unappealing, mind-numbing, arbitrarily-punishing sandbox ever created.
---
I know a desert is a desert, but...it seems like they could have done *something* more engaging. Anything.
---
Servers still crashing, great job bethesda. 
---
I've wanted this since launch. The repsec option per level is kind of dumb and made me give up on my other character entirely until they implement something like full respec option. It's fairly simple to do. It would just add x amount of points into your pool and remove all cards so you have to relearn them all.
---
&gt;f someone else built on it before you?  Th
---
I saw the orange trash cans where's scrap-able, got all the trucks/cars, the light-up signs in the buildings, a couple shelves (majority wouldn't let me scrap, but a couple would), and washing machines. There wasn't anything previously built (not even resource extractors) including turrets. I've looked EVERYWHERE but I still can't seem to find anything. I walk around in build mode and put my mouse on pretty much everything to see if it'll turn green. I'm at a loss ): 40% is so much, I really can't see what I'm missing.
---
Indeed
---
I'm on PS4 and I don't think I've seen this. 
---
Visually the game has been loading mostly lowres textures because either my connection can't cope or the hardware the servers is using is under some kind of strain.
---
Awwwwwe did you have to scroll an extra post?  We will stop posting this shit when we get answers. Until then, get used to it. 
---
While this does suck , having someone kill you then invite you to chat should of been a red flag right away. Most likely you had a run in with some COD kiddies who duped themselves and spend their time trolling others.
---
I know because our little group spends alot of time hunting dupers and griefers harrassing others.
---
Make sure to block them in game so they can no longer join off you as you change server.
---
I like to give a "gift bag" when I see level 2's exiting 76. The trick is making sure the SEE it...    
---
Usually some frag grenades, stimpacks, a nicely modded level 1 pipe gun/ammo, a pocketed leather chest piece and some water.  Maybe every other day, I do this when I can, for the past couple weeks. Then, last night, I was starting a new character, see  a level 130+ guy in the creepy clown face waving "follow me". He made me a lovely suit of level 1 Heavy Leather armor.  It was nice to receive. Definitely makes some bits of the early game nicer :) 
---
No. PC has a new patch today, next week for the rest of us.
---
Once you can kill Scorchbeasts rapidly and reliably, Ultracite literally drops out of the sky in the Bog. Power Patcher and Fix It Good together also significantly reduce how much Ultracite you need to keep your armor up and running.
---
Hmmmmm?

I feel you on the gun weight. (In game...not irl.) I've got a rifle that weighs 21 pounds...it weighs more than a damn minigun... like.. what the fuck?
---
I'm on my third day trying to get the perfect build... so painful. Do you have any recipes or just buying from the bunker? 
---
Maybe I'll finally get the challenge for killing a Yao Guai. 
---
Very good point, thats similar to how I persuaded myself to be okay with my actions. Doing a terrible thing, for a noble reason. Although its not like there were literally any alternatives.
---
Any power armor! Join the space marine RP!
---
Ideally when you take out npcs and rpg elements you expect something in return like a balanced meta or rock solid stability
---
So if I traded my caps and items that I spent time and effort to earn and traded them for some weapons and armor even though I did everything I could when I got them to make sure they weren't duped, just oh well for me and my time because you think it's fair. 
---
I did everything I could checking the persons post history on reddit, seeing if they had an unreasonable amount of items in their inventory and the one time I did find someone selling dupes I immediately closed the trade menu and left. 
---
I honestly don't think I have any duped items anyway as I only have one explosive, and everything else is just Two shot because I didn't want explosive on them, but someone else, who like me, doesn't have tens of thousands of caps saved up to throw around and saved and saved so they could get that one weapon they wanted for their enjoyment who cares because some people don't like then having it. 
---
The economy is already borked in the short term because they took so long to patch this. Hopefully this is the end of the exploit, but I don't see why my PVE experience should be impacted now. I don't PVP and doubt I ever will so on the off chance my Shotgun that I also don't plan on getting rid of is duped how does that affect you, you're gameplay, the economy, or anything else that justifies what amount to taking away the time and effort I've already put into the game. 
---
I'm sorry this post is rambling, but it frustrates me to no end how people want to dictate what I can have in game because of an exploit I didn't knowingly participate in, and  especially since how I play doesn't effect anyone but me.
---
Yup same.
---
Then when I did what I mentioned it fixed it.
---
i hope not, that would be $200!
---
Sorry that the only way you know how to win the video game is to whine until things get easier for you. Your mother must be so proud.

next time just press alt F4, best way to win against griefers
---
The lever action reload animation has bugged me since Far Harbor, praise atom. Also, can’t wait to see how many pounds I dropped from the bobby-pin weight change. 
---
Well they must if they say stash limit is in place because of server load?  Otherwise why have a stash cap
---
Wait really
---
Same.  Must be a PC or Xbox thing.  I've not once seen this.
---
Just getting worse
---
Thats free speech for ya (or as free as it gets anyhow). I dont blame people for being angry about fallout 76, Bethesda needs to understand that they cant get away with this.
---
Downvotee by fanboy bitches. 76 is an objectively horrible game, i was just wondering if it was still horrible. Geez.
---
Can we talk about how a 90% weight redux on all tise still has it weighing 8 lbs? That should mean a standard super sledge weighs in at 80 lbs. Somebody at bethesda doesn't understand how percentages work.
---
Its a broken record that somehow, the people its directed at continue to ignore, despite them saying they *have* heard it.
---
Reason its brought up because it still isn't fixed despite it still being an issue. These guns are supposed to be the fucking epitome of technology to the point the military standardized them but what kinda military would use a gun that has a lifespan of 3 minutes?
---
&gt;, having someone kill you then invite you to chat should of been a red flag right away.
---
That's true, like I said I wanted to know what they have to say cause
---
&gt;I know because our little group spends alot of time hunting dupers and griefers harrassing others.

Now that's the kind of players we need in this game

I'll join

I totally get that and honestly I normally wouldn't care but like you, myself and everyone else in this sub, we all paid good, hard earned money just to have our experience with this game tarnished by inconsiderate scumbags like these guys. No one here, not even the moderators, can tell me they've never had the server crash while in game during the worst possible time. By not putting these guys on blast and just ignoring them for the sake of a "witch hunt" allows them and their followers to continue ruining the game. If they want to ban me then fuck it. I'll just sit back and watch this sub eat itself out of frustration. 
---
I just got home and logged in to test, absolutely true... loads all 20 rounds
---
It's a big chunk of some really bad stuff they fixed.
---
It's not everything of course, and I'll gladly wait for QOP changes to come as long as they show solid effort in upending the capsized canoe.
---
Why is it 4 gigs on console and 1/2 a gig on PC?
---
Chems and Bobbleheads can net a decent income. My first character has Pharma Farma and the one that allows the weight of chems to be reduced maxed. I can go out for a bit and get a ton of them and deplete every vendors cap stash and still have plenty left.
---
So on my game it's showing absolute 0. But if I drop some I can sometimes see my total weight tick down 🤔
---
The Int SPECIAL description says it helps the “return you get from scrapping.”  It’s vague on WHAT returns you’re getting, and I’m not sure if I get say 12 instead of 10-11 metal for scrapping missile launchers because of high int.  The rate at which you learn mods is likely affected, but hard to definitively test it.
---
Hornwright estate's elevator is also bugged, I was crouching when I teleport a flood above in the protectron tube area.
---
Well i still hope my best buddy warms up for the game eventually. Do not have much friends no more and since i am about to pass away anyway soon, i just try to enjoy what i can. Of course doesn't help if these kind of idiots cross your experience. ^^
---
Guy with TSE minigun : Oho! You’re approaching me? Instead of running away, you come right to me?
---
Lvl 7: I can’t let your TSE minigun beat the shit out of you without coming closer!
---
I feel you on the "I spoke too soon" caps.
---
"Maybe in the future" is also part of my point. Every MMO I can think of started off pretty rocky with tons of players quitting left and right and over years have developed larger player bases, better core mechanics, and new metas players find.
---
Consider yourself too little man. 
---
It crashes for me also. At least every 15-20min was just about to finish a power plant event. And no im not using a TESLA gun it crashes when I walk, open the inventory or use the favorite item wheel.
---
the emojis are too much vro
---
Its a shit game objectively, get over it!
---
Nah I dont believe in Karma whoring hence why I speak my mind most of the time.
---
My point I guess is you get punished (if one looks at it like that) for speaking your mind.
---
In fact it makes you stop trying to help others because your statement gets pushed into oblivion: even if factual.
---
So I just stopped trying as much. 🤷‍♂️
---
Why are they not fixing automatic laser rifles breaking in like 40 shots!!! I am sad... 
---
Try the market76 discord. Also instigating is awesome for guass rifles. 
---
&gt;If Bethesda doesn't have the tools to check those they are beyond incompetent.
---
Narrator: They are in fact that incompetent.
---
The server has to load "X" items, it does not know what they are and is not able to identify which items are being loaded.
---
Stash cap prevents lag on servers due to the server hiccuping when loading many unique items. 
---
I could be wrong, but this is what I've read.
---
Do the pellets spread
---
raider gang rise up
---
I have a single TSE (Flamer) that I bought from someone who sold it to me at cost. They sell everything TSE at in-game cost to everyone in an attempt to middle-finger profiteers who are ruining the economy.
---
It wouldn't bother me at all if it was deleted along with everyone else's TES's inn order to reset the economy.
---
Was hoping for a fix to grounded so that it’s actually affected by the perk that reduces negative effects. 
---
Oh no!  Xbox?  We always play on team and sometimes have to run 2.  We play almost everyday 
---
Go to the Whitespring where there is inevitably someone there (since you can't go to anyone directly cause you can't see them on the map) then literally jump up and down in front of them. They'll be sure to want to shoot you soon
---
It’s how many stars the item have 
---
Well patches makes the game more stable and fun. So lenght is good, regarding patches.
---
I enjoy it alot. 
---
It's hard to be a fire breather with power armour.
---
1.21 GIGAWATTS
---
TSE bullshit ruined pvp, the one thing I really enjoyed. They need to nerf the effects to something that isn't broken. 
---
We all do.. maybe one day.
---
I have a Quad Laser Rifle, that has a magazine count of 107 or something, And it doesn't even get half through that before it breaks.
---
That’s a different link you illiterate incel. 
---
The song is awful.  I can't believe John Denver's people signed off on it.  
---
I got you, haha
---
While I agree in theory with your comment, the use of ‘people are spoiled’ is an instant downvote. It is the gaming companies jobs to create games that function. Gamers need to understand perfecting an online game is a process, but we shouldn’t be expecting less than perfection. 
---
At the munitions factory there are large anti-air turrets outside that take up a lot of budget. I was confused also what was using the budget, but when I repaired everything at the console they became active, and they help with the level 80 Scorchbeast attacks.
---
Man you're really heated. Do you need some tea? Maybe a lie down? Maybe a break from 76?
---
I think you already can?
---
Got a few more Enclave events/scorchbeasts/whatever before I can launch one myself. But the impression I got was you can prettymuch throw them whereever. Most people throw them at Whitesprings or Prime, but I've seen a couple just kind off in random spots.
---
How do you repair it to above 100%? I know how to repair, but is there something i have to do to get it beyond 100% besides have the perk equipped?
---
When i have the perks equiped, it just repairs it to 100%. 
---
How did you get that from what I wrote here? 
---
I use the text chat mod, it adds so much to the game.
---
Wow haha You gotta lotta hate inside you. I don't think it has to do with a video game tho
---
No one gives a fuck what you hate 
---
I heard "I can pay in so much caps" in Trump's voice. Hahaha
---
I wonder if the appearance has changed.
---
Should be able to make bobby pins too. Hell, a short length of wire would do the same job.
---
It's always so confusing to me how people immediately jump on and defend things like this.
---
At this point they was as well just come out and say you can't fight in nuke zones without PA.
---
I thought they had purposely declassified it from Heavy Weapons category awhile back.
---
&gt;Workshops: Fixed issues where enemies at some Workshop locations would spawn underground, making the Workshops unclaimable. Locations include: Charleston Landfill, Lakeside Cabins, and Sunshine Meadows.
---
Huzzah, the hell hounds have been banished.
---
&gt;Systems: Fixed an issue where bashing an enemy with the Railway Rifle or Crossbow would add the projectile to the enemy's inventory.
---
I just imagined that the character was grabbing a bolt or spike and stabbing the enemy with it as an ad hoc melee weapon.
---
&gt;Crafting: Updated Bulk Acid crafting recipe to require 15 Acid.
---
Question for u/LoneVaultWanderer: Does this mean that bulk acid we currently have will be bumped up to 15 as well?
---
&gt;Scorched: Fixed an issue where Scorched may be using invisible weapons or not appearing to fire their weapon correctly.
---
&gt;Scorched: Fixed an issue that caused floating debris and disassembled guns to appear in Scorched hands when killed.
---
Ok everyone, the scorched have been given proper gun safety lessons, and will no longer use their weapons via black magic.
---
I have a TSE and I’ve killed myself with it more than anything else in the game. LOL. 
---
Yeah with the mistress of mysteries quest i had to drop all my holotapes except the quest one for the terminal to take it. 
---
the animation seems to go a little more quickly now, so it's still not great, but not as bad as I was expecting.
---
Add me, CrashKetchup. How many you need? I can just give ya a few.
---
Looks fixes to me
---
Not just you gain levels above 50, so do the mobs. What you gain are new perk cards and now respec points too.
---
You can construct anything you want in your head, but this is just a copy-paste of Fallout 4 and it's designed from the ground up to allow players to keep leveling above level 50.
---
&gt; Now read this article written in 2017.
---
&gt; Maybe he doesn't pvp
---
pvp isn't a choice when you get 1-shot 
---
I ended up making a new character ):
---
I’ll take the downvotes to say this....
---
“We put out a severely broken game, break this game for us.” “You accepted our challenge &amp; broke the piss out of broken game, you’re now banned. How dare you do what we told you to.”

---
It goes from 75% to 90%, so you lose 5% but it still works. 90% is max reduction.
---
What he said
---
What the fuck... Okay so you're clearly on PC. Update your graphics drivers and reset the Nvidia control panel settings if you're nvidia.
---
Any GPU OCs maybe causing that?
---
How old is your hardware?
---
Any video overlays or such running that could modify the video output?
---
Well if you find out and/or remember, let me know. I have a friend who has the paint I'm 100% sure of that.
---
I was attacked by a scorchbeast in a cave! It was flying through the walls and hitting me while inside the walls with it’s gas!
---
Also your screenshots no longer appear on load screens until like 2 seconds before it is done loading. So they somehow broke that. 
---
Yea, I noticed that it said that, but I always thought it only referred to material returns. But now that it seemed like I'm getting more mods, I wonder if it does mean both. I think I'm going to increase my Int to max to see, was already increasing it to 13 anyway so I can have Demolitionist 5, Gunsmith 5, and 3 of the energy weapon ammo weight reduction one. I'm sure I can find 2 more Int perks that would be cool to have on all the time.
---
No, anyone that talks about a video game company using the same language as a jilted ex-lover is working through their own shit. 
---
Had the same issue, now it won’t let me log back in as it thinks I’m still on the server. It will now take hours until I can log back in if I can at all. Last two logins the game crashed at the load screen. 
---
I fell sorry for guys like you. Genuinely. Pleasure in the things you do is shamefull. What a sad day for humanity. 
---
Mans gotta do what a mans gotta do 
---
Here is a video I recorded yesterday of a lvl 80 spamming worse than I'd ever seen. It shouldn't be able to rapid fire at me, despite facing and flying in the opposite direction.

---
TSE aren't really that easy to find via drops, it's the saturated market by dupers. After close to 400 hours, nobody, including myself, that I've played with has found one.
---
Yeah, I mentioned that type of thing when I said "a few confirmed ebay sale"
---
irl ballistic heavy support weapons have barrels that need to be swapped on a regular basis (every few hundred rounds) and we're trying to keep these guns rigged together after the fucking apocalypse. They are usually manned by a team or even a squad and we're lugging them around solo... And if you are emptying/breaking your guns so quickly, maybe you need to learn to use short controlled bursts instead of panic firing until your shit breaks?
---
Can't have a negative opinion if you don't play or barely played the game. Play too much and you can't say anything negative because you must have been having fun with no issues to put in so much time.
---
Ridiculous.
---
I got power fist plans from one of the last enclave quests? Not sure if that's a guaranteed drop 
---
Can you point out the example of rationalization or justification in the op's post?
---
You sure you know what those terms mean?
---
Iirc that was the Single shot grenade launcher thing?
---
These people couldn't even program a vendor properly you think they could have item tracking? 
---
Is every armor different? My pocketed raider chest gives 15 and it's not even deep pocketed or legendary
---
I’m just imagining the horror of a mole miner with  TSE shotgun 
---
Is it bannable to use this still? I've seen people equally arguing both sides, and my FPS has taken a hit recently, so I'd like to improve it best I can.
---
It gives you +3 or +5 charisma (forgot which one) and better buying and selling prices from vendors for a period of time.
---
Yay I could finally delete the 33 water purifiers that gave me an error anytime I tried to scrap them from stored, plus all the phantom items that were taking a big chunk of my budget.
---
You are completely right all I’m saying is as new guns new bosses ect become available higher grade legendary ect  if the stash limit stays the same most
---
Weapons that are duped are still good weapons but depending on what Bethesda and fallout creates to keep us busy and entertained some of those guns will remain but if things do change like how I explained most of those guns will disappear / become obsolete the won’t  be complete non existent but it’s a better price
---
To pay them being banned or deleted
---
For owning a dupped  weapon 
---
Also:  A blank signpost that can be used with the small letters
---
Not sure if you're being ironic or if you're really unaware of what a massive shitshow the launch of that game was...?
---
See what plans we own and identify a PA chassis without having to place six of them in a circle around you to find the right one. Holding out for those two. Really expected to see at least one of them in these notes. Some great changes but MAN these two things are so obvious. Fingers crossed for next patch!
---
So high level means duper? So you can fuck off with that mentality. 
---
Yup. That's why I think meta-chasers are dumb as fuck. 
---
My understanding is the 20 pound sledge goes to 2. But the built on mod is 6 pounds and the weight reduction effect doesnt effect mods, just base weight
---
No longer on pc
---
Sort of. It has a very high effective range (i.e before damage drop off) but at long range you might start noticing it not doing the full damage, especially on smaller enemies
---
Makes sense
---
Can he just paint your armor for you?
---
That was for it not being considered a shotgun
---
I’ve duped nothing &amp; don’t want anything banned. 
---
Use the carpenter's perk when you build it. It takes a measurable amount less flux. 
---
Buy them on the reddit market or farm nuke zones. 
---
What platform are you on?
---
Did they not? I've never noticed that
---
They have scorchbeast power armor - it’s called Ultracite.
---
And, like Dragonbone armor in Skyrim, it was kinda shitty compared to the “next best” armor available much earlier in the game!
---
Anyone that was duping has enough for the whole lifetime of this game
---
Xbox
---
&gt;This one bug wasn’t fixed therefore the developers don’t care...
---
🤔
---
Girl bye 
---
You 100% do not receive loot from legendary mobs at events unless you tag it or someone in your group tags it. You'll often see people use the come here emote at events like Uranium Fever specifically because of this. Pretty sure crown enemies are exactly the same, but I don't really pay much attention to those so they could be different. Legendary mobs though, it is absolutely a requirement to tag the mob. And while it does remove PvP slap damage while in an event area, it doesn't extend the tagging to everyone in the area.
---
Same, tweaked the hell out of my drivers, shut down / reprioritized background apps..
---
 Do you run more than one client? (I'm multi boxing on one PC)
---
Inb4 BGS lever action patch accidentally deletes everyone’s guns 
---
And you could make two lots of 180 50’cap machine gun rounds using lead from 15 pencils. 
---
First get Contractor Perk 2*...then Go to Whitesprings Nuke zone...you can get everything but Violet....then head down to a Fissure Prime Nuke zone and collect the Violet.
---
Uhhhhh Dupes? I'm 110 and never even SEEN a piece of those. 
---
No I'm aware of the ultracite I would like a separate suit from the ultracite that you craft from scorchbeast if that makes sense, like it would resemble a scorchbeast
---
Inb4 “lulz duper”... kendiese937 on PSN. I’m just barely over level 50. No legendary weapons. I’ve duped nothing. Just making a point. 
---
Ah, well crap. If youda said pc, i would have given you ghe flux for free. 
---
To be fair to you, your idea isn't a bad one, I just don't think it fixes much on it's own.
---
But your idea combined with a nerf to how explosive weapons work would do wonders.
---
Google raider overhaul 
---
I don't know if it's platform based but on Xbox one X I've not had a lot of disconnects, I can usually go a good 3-4 hour stint without any drops or crashes. I've had a few but usually they occur within the first 30 minutes but after that it seems stable.
---
No fix for damage output or to reduce enemy defense? That's honestly why I don't play anymore. It should take 25 bullets, my gun condition, and two pieces of broken armor to kill enemies. I'm level 40, have solid weapons, but the actual combat in this game is lacking so bad. I really did want to love this game, but until something is done about the gameplay I'm shelving it.
---
I brought up the technology lore thing because from that standpoint, there isn't a reason to use the guns if this is their status. I'm not using IRL as the basis here, I'm using the games universe.
---
Idk if you know this, but the way condition works is it doesn't go down if it doesn't hit the target. Shooting a full conditioned gun into the sky doesn't detriment condition.
---
I kill 4 scorched with a furious laser rifle using about like 2 or 3 clips, and I lose a fucking fourth of an entire condition bar.
---
Comparatively, I shoot a handmade, kill 4 scorched within a single clip, and there is no noticeable difference in condition.
---
This isn't about fucking panic fire, its obviously a glaring issue. There's a reason absolutely no one runs these damn weapons.
---
Personally I just don’t think PvP works in this game in general, and I don’t mean that like “oh, PvP is broken”, I mean that like “oh, it really doesn’t fit in.”
---
Like, I think the whole raiding aspect of the game is awesome. Being able to destroy other peoples camps to where they have to rebuild, alright that’s interesting since that would basically make you a raider. THE PROBLEM IS the fact that it’s pretty much pointless. You don’t get anything out of it, you reap any rewards, you just look like an asswipe. Why bother killing someone or destroying a base when the only thing you get out of it is junk? If they even drop any junk?
---
I didn’t see it but I may have missed it. Was armor/weapon mods automatically being used in crafting addressed? 
---
Not sure I rarely ever disconnect so I'm not sure if your Internet will get better might wanna ask your ISP
---
Ideally on my wife’s account on the second monitor (and her mule is on mine).
---
This was clearly a release focused on fixes, not new features. And they fixed the duplication bug (or at least one of them).
---
Out of the loop. How did duper’s ruin end game 
---
Actions speak louder than words, kiddo.
---
Ah man well thanks for the attempt at generosity 
---
The "On Patrol Duty" event at **Eastern Regional Penitentiary** drops a weapon plan. (The Jail Break event doesn't; if that's what you trigger when you run up to the front door, just jump servers.) At level 97, I picked up the plans for the handmade gun on my fourth time running the On Patrol Duty event.
---
While I agree with the gist of your post,  you might want to employ a spellchecker when questioning another's intellect. 
---
Laser weapons need to have energy resistance effected by armor reduction perks. 
---
That’s honestly where they are hurting more than anything. A bloodied laser rifle of mine can get up to 270 damage at low health with rifleman perks. My hardened handmade will be at 108 damage. Even against the robots in Watoga (robots have lower base energy resistance, meaning energy weapons should be better against them) Tank Killer does not reduce the energy resistance of enemies. So even though that hand made is showing half the damage of the laser rifle, it’s still killing in 3-4 shots vs the laser rifle taking 6-8. 
---
This is way more simple than that.
---
One single extra line of text on a plan's info screen.
---
"Known" or "Not Known"
---
Done. Finished. Complete.
---
So easy. I don't understand why we even have to ask for this.
---
Yes. A thousand times yes. 
---
I rock nuka nut, can do, and iron stomach. Its pretty nice!
---
I'm sure they corrected it in a recent patch, yes. 
---
\[PC\] Wolfdoggie
---
Just now: I fast traveled to a nuke site, killed Scorchbeast Queen when she was 10-20% HP left (a lot of people there). 
---
She dropped a bunch of ammo and useless junk\~ no recipes or equipment. Someone on voice confirmed same thing but then the game/server crashed. :o
---
Just buying from the bunker sorry
---
Math checks out, game mechanics on that decision seem silly to me. Weight redux should apply to anything attached to the base weapon. Still, thanks for shedding some light on it. Cheers.
---
Side question, would the legenary effect stack with the perk, further reducing the weight?
---
Max out the vendors everyday.  If you need stuff to sell you can use your camp to farm resources, farm the BOS place for straight jackets, or use the Pharma Farmer perk to get tons of meds.  Weapons and armor aren't worth carrying to sell because they're too heavy for the amount of caps you get.
---
I don't know if it's the patch but I'm disconnecting every 5 minutes.  Never experienced it this badly before.
---
They need to fix the power chassis so that we know which ones are.
---
Smart move. You wouldn’t want to share information. What if someone else uses your mysterious trick? Then they might outshine you as “that douche on reddit who thinks he’s cool cause he allegedly knows something others don’t”. 
---
Bethesda Justice Warrior? Ha, amazing, and disturbing... it's a game, some people like it some people don't, like every game. Nice along, nothing of interest to see here. 
---
Your taking this really hard. Considering it's just a game.
---
Yes, I like this idea.
---
Maybe people like you can be forgiven, maybe you can be good people. If you're capable of grief you understand what it is to hurt. So you know what it means to care about the greater good too, you just don't care yet. Maybe one day you'll understand what it is to be human. 
---
I'm a new player and I got a noob question. Can you store something without the risk of it getting stolen? 
---
I got some power armor (which I cant even use for another 20-30 levels, but I still want to keep it) that's encumbering me. Could I just put it in my stash box without worrying about a player taking it?
---
Played since beta on XB1X, rarely if ever DC even during SBQ I would be stable. However last night I had 4 DC in a row. One of them locked up the game and quit me completely out of it back to the Xbox dashboard. 
---
Cyrodiil did nothing to deserve them
---
My 'thanks' is my continued use of the product. I think it has been made very clear that the publishers (not necessarily the devs) do not view this work as art, but as a product. My gratitude is conveyed, with this in mind, in continuing to endorse a company which only some weeks ago I would have described as having swindled me. Just my 2 caps.
---
LEVER ACTION RELOAD BEST FIX THANK GOD
---
Yeah experience had taught me better for it. Also i notice others do the same. But after you finish the end game stuff. You will find two types of people those that help others and those that troll others.
---
I am confident enough in my experience to say very few become the latter. But they are still around and if  they find it funny to do so. Then we show them just how fun it is when you can't fight back as well.
---
Using TSE weapons and certain armor sets to stop almost all damage. We can be a pain in their neck and hopefully they learn to better member's of the 76 community.
---
I like this post but I think it needs more stars...
---
Ok I'll add you now.  I need 10.
---
Have you found a way to fix how generally shitty this game is?  You’re game is bad and you should feel bad!  In one single swoop you ruined a franchise that had a devoted following.  
---
The BETA has been over for almost 2 months. 
---
Carhenge, like Stonehenge 
---
This didn't happen.
---
I noticed that accidental bounties compel me to misbehave. I usually bump it up to 50 or 100 deliberately, maybe try to murder somebody to entice people to end it. Sort of counterintuitive psychological stuff. Usually I'm pretty nice.
---
I’ll pencil you in. How’s next Tuesday for you?
---
Is it safe yet to complain about sev 5 kinda stuff like the radio getting louder when you zoom in on your scope?
---
PC here. Never seen this happen
---
Coulda fooled me...
---
ICR
---
When you say it like that, yeah. But I’m sick of hearing about how username LucasSimmms wasted $30 on this game on sale and he’s level 130 and the game sucks blah blah blah nothing to do, yet continuously increases in levels.
---
 In my opinion, the game ‘pays for itself’ for me if I can get 50 hours out of a $60 game. 
---
I don’t mean to say that somebody who actually played a lot of the game has no opinion. And OBVIOUSLY this game isn’t perfect and has mixed reviews and some people think it’s garbage. I can respect that, it’s not for everyone! Perhaps I should’ve elaborated, because while I think their opinion holds more weight, I think it would be even more weighted if they actually backed what they said. Oh, they say the game sucks and they’re done playing? Put down the damn controller or play something else! 
---
Yeah! I know ... I must put more next post ..
---
The scorched beast queen area is good for violet flux, and you get a handful of flux for killing the queen. But hit a whitespring nuke fist stock up on all your other components. Hardened mass, glowing mass, and high radiation fluids. And you can get alot of raw flux there. Cant find many violets though. Use the green thumb perk while picking flux. And when building your arch, use the contractors perk. 
---
They should have If I am  a pacifist mode I should not be attack at all but is acknoweing that u still get attack. By other players
---
Go on
---
Funny you guys all say its just a game. Yeah true, but some people care about those games, and people like you try and remove that fun and pleasure from other people. That's a game mechanic yes, but it's not the human thing to do. I wonder what horrible experiences life threw at you to make you such a bitter person. It's quite sad. Sorry for you. 
---
Doesn’t look like it has been taken care of yet per the 1/10 patch notes. Wow. 
---
Anything in your stash is safe
---
The best way to store power armor is to stick it on the chassis
---
To do this:
---
1. Find Power Armor Chassis in apparel tab
---
2. Place the chassis (do not drop it, default A on xbox)
---
3. Transfer all power armor pieces onto the chassis (default x button on xbox)
---
4. Wait 60 seconds and it will go into your inventory, with all of the pieces attached to the chassis so it only weighs 10lb for everything 
---
Then how did it become available for me to cook?
---
Thank you👍🏻 these issues are never fixed
---
On there own iv played multiple mmorpgs with these exact issues the only true way to slow it down is to keep on top of duping glitches-ect they fix trade issues to there’s a lot that needs to be added including time dropping level 55-60 legendarys isent going to fix it over night of course you need to let players work out how they are to obtain these weapons what bosses to kill ect but I bet you the same players complaining about lack of end game content are the same players who bought dupped op weapons to begin with rather the grind there own out 
---
Thank you, lol.
---
How much for the 2 shot shotgun?
---
The released a patch today for PC. I think the reduced weight of Bobby pins works. If the servers were more stable and game crashed less, I could see if anything else was actually fixed
---
There should be 1 pointing the other way, and a chest filled with goodies at the end
---
Or you could just tell people about it in the comments?? Then you won’t have to negatively comment on these threads in the future. 
---
I know there’s a couple budget glitches like phantom wires and unusable/undeletable purifies in CAMPS, but I haven’t heard anything about workshops doing that too.  I’m on Xbox, so maybe it’s a PC-specific thing?
---
Some people want to PvP. If someone destroys your camp I guess they want to PvP. If you want to PvP you can go and defend it and then fight each other. Or if you want to PvP you can intentionally get a bounty. Destroying a camp gets you a bounty. The more you destroy the more your bounty is worth. When someone shoots you with a bounty you get a chance to fight back. Etc. You can also take workshops if you want to PvP without the camp and bounty stuff. You can claim and wait for an attacker, or you can attack the workshop. PvP system in this game is broken in some ways, but the design and intention is on the right track.
---
There's no point in fighting the SBQ anymore since 90% of players got the duped TSE stuffs, there are supposed to be super rare and not this common.
---
Also no point in finding and trying to sell those legitimately obtained TSE either cuz they are so cheap now.  
---
We need either a fresh start server or a private server to fix the damage done.
---
Anyone found one yet? Did 5 hours in non-stop ghouls in WhiteSprings (glowing) and didn't have a single 1* drop
---
Oh good, now people can stop posting about it in every single thread.
---
I got a fully leveled set of Ultracite for completing a quest. Why do you need to craft it?
---
"Batteries Included" reduces the weight of *all* energy ammo, including Fusion Cores, by 90%. My 150 cores weigh 45 pounds (or whatever the weight is supposed to be measured in). The only reason I carry so many is because I use a Gatling Laser, otherwise I'd drop most of 'em.
---
I don't, it breaks.
---
I know exactly where that is in the Mire because my base is 100 feet down that river from you.  I hope one day we connect on the same server and can be neighbors.
---
Someone said a couple hours ago on here that he got an instigating one
---
Make sure you have enough of the other components to make a stable flux before wasting time picking flowers. The raw flux expires quickly. 
---
Could not agree more and since the serverd are broken into 24 players at a time. It should not be an issue to have a setting using the current Pacfist or not option to assign the server choice.
---
Player v player / environment - full damage and weary of one another at all times.
---
Player v environment only / pacifist on - Unable to harm others and unable to harm player owned buildings outside of workshop control events.
---
nice
---
My quad handmade however....limitless power!!!!
---
I wish I had that kind of luck, I've only found one TSE Lever Action and I made a new character and leveled it JUST to use that gun.
---
Even with that being said though, I wouldn't mind if it got deleted to fix EVERYONE running around with it.
---
Please do!
---
Running around screaming for blood with a drill and fasnacht mask
---
If people didn't buy them then why are so many duping them?  And since people are buying them.  Then I would think another part of the community has spoken as to how they want to play the game they also purchased? 
---
&gt;The Enclave are the "good guys"
---
HAHAHAHAHA
---
Ah, you might wanna edit your title then. Sounds interesting though.
---
Completely agree since they have no other in game alternatives.  
---
I appraise in the Fo76 Bazaar. In its first week, TSE Lever Actions were like 18K caps all day. Now you’d be lucky to get 5-6 for one. The market is flooded. 
---
How? 308 is the most common ammo for me.
---
I would say some of the early areas of the game
---
Or, drop the items you don't want. 
---
Leave server. Gone. 
---
I have had great success stashing any junk, fast travelling to the vault, sitting on a bench and taking a break. I go to the bathroom or take care of a small errand. When I come back I am often dead as a doornail.
---
Same, getting non-stop application crashes (reported by Windows application log) since this patch.
---
Eastern regional penitentiary has a bunch of low level super muties that usually drop 308. Could server hop farm them. 
---
same here, used to crash to desktop like really on rare occasions. Got more crash to desktop since the update then in a month..
---
Ahhh, is that why i keep getting disconnected?  It's like Bethesda is running FO76 on a bunch of AWS EC2 instances that commit seppuku if there are too many writes to a database in a specific amount of time.
---
Thanks, for reference I basically only use the hunting rifle

My thread is abit old but it should fill you in on the damage. Including the third and fourth picture as main points.

500Caps

Imho ski sword if u look dps 
---
Never tried (cause I dont have a decent one) the assaultron blade
---
And also machete with the legendary mod should be good
---
I love that the mobs fight each other in this game. 
---
There's a cost for things with inherently more power? :o
---
Just don't use grenadier rank 2 with it.. unless you onlny ever fire while walking backwards and aiming up at 45 degrees...
---
Probably over looked them.
---
People do dupe them yes, but he was asking how he did it. I was just giving an answer. 
---
I’ll sound like an idiot , but how do you serve hop? Do you just restart the game ?
---
Very top left of the map is a wood mill that spawns level 5-10 super mutants, over half use 308. You can normally get 50-100 rounds every time you go. 
---
You also get gunpowder from them, so you can craft your own 308 as well. 
---
No.
---
Yep not sure it gets so much love. I am probably not its target audience.
---
I suspect the NV in Space game will be similar. It will get amazing reviews and I will start it up to only be bored out of my skull and only complete it because I paid for it.
---
I replayed FO 1, FO 3 and FO 4 but never NV. Completed the main quest and never went back.
---
that is terrifying
---
Nice, missed that in the comment, well atleast we know it's possible now!
---
Could be a bug from today’s patch but excavator armor now showing 269/242/366 @ level 45
---
It could be me, but I’ve literally never had a disconnect on any other game. 
---
Could be an issue with the patches since PC can be hot fixed and given patches anytime. While consoles must go through a lengthy process before the game is patched.
---
Some doors did, some doors didn't. The first door you have access to, the one that's got 4 large glass panes, doesn't sit right in them, instead it floats a couple inches off the frame.
---
Wolves don't particularly want to fight other wolves. They want to fight the sheep. Some wolves want to fight the wolves that want to fight the sheep. Some people want to be outlaws. Some people want to be sheriffs. Some people want to be farmers. Etc. Game systems work best and are more interesting when they accommodate everyone.
---
I know the lead artist for FO76.  He also worked on Fallout 4 (you can see his likeness on some of the paintings in the game) and Fallout 3 (Point Lookout DLC was his baby).
---
We are all #BethesdaJusticeLeague
---
But you can't get one shot unless you attack the person that has a one shot weapon first. 
---
Not to mention 2-3 fusion cores if you need them as well. Several creating stations there as well if you need to break down whatever junk/guns while gathering ammo
---
You can't paint other people's armor. I'm just wondering if it can be dropped and/or worked on at a Power Station and taken that way
---
Oh, I only use it for long range or when my shotgun runs out of ammo, so I guess that explains it.
---
Gives you +5 cowboy boner
---
I sent you a message, I have stable violent not pure violet.
---
A. It's a BGS game and online. We shouldn't have expected anything else. Is that growingly unacceptable, yes. But I don't understand those who were surprised. 
---
 
---
B. I think the BETA should have began shortly after E3. Not a month before release.
---
You could also test by drinking alcohol or taking mentats to see a change (or if you have marsupial mutation and the Class Freak card, try with and without the perk card for a 4 Int difference).
---
As for cards, don’t forget “Scrapper”!  Other decent ones are Pharmacist (radaway more effective) and First Aid (stimpaks more effective), or Contractor to reduce camp/workshop materials cost
---
I love that. I’ve been sporting that outfit ever since I found it. I’m surprised more people haven’t talked about it. Especially since it’s statistically the best head piece in the game /jk. (It is but 1 dr doesn’t effect anything)
---
Yeah just don't be sad if i accidentally shoot you because you made me jump lol.. 
---
Don't have to restart the whole game. Just log out to the main menu, and click play again. It'll generally put you in a new server. 
---
I would love this. Not into PvP at all. I like questing, crafting, role playing with a team. Exploring the map. Having adventures together against mobs. Not each other. 
---
I love this, you've inspired me. Is this how cults are born?
---
pinapple ham?
---
Alright then thanks 
---
Ugh my 10 shot only reloaded 5!

I may have found a way. I'm going to try it, but if you recall how you did it let me know.

Too bad I'm on xbox I would love to take part!! Thumbs up on this awesome idea and having all the great ground rules for a fair match!

*_THEN PAY WITH YOUR BLOOD!_*
---
Can you trade it to him, have him paint it, then trade it back?
---
Haha thanks bro
---
&gt;Wolves don't particularly want to fight other wolves. They want to fight the sheep.
---
People who want a weaker opponent suck.
---
A good fight is a fair fight.
---
Wrong gun. Wrong animation.
---
Double Barrel Shotgun doesn't have an animation that loads each bullet separately..... Lever Action Rifle, Pump Action Shotgun and Single Action Revolver, maybe others, they're the ones I'm sure of off the top of my head.
---
If you fire one shell with the pump, the reload animation is of loading one shell, if you fire two, two shells, etc. all the way to the full clip which is about 7-8 shells (can't remember) which then has a ridiculously long animation of loading each of those shells back into the gun..... If you have a QUAD PUMP and fire 32 shells then the reload animation is of loading 32 shells back into the gun.
---
The point is about the animation of guns that load each bullet individually. The double barrel does not do that, it isn't in the same category. That's not what people are talking about.
---
The Lever Action has had wonked animation since Fallout 4, where it always loads 5 bullets, no matter how many you fire..... Fire one, load five, fire two, load five etc..... Obviously (Pity I didn't click on to this myself) when using a Double or Quad Lever Action the animation was still stuck at loading 5 bullets, even if you shot 20.... So it became a positive glitch (not really a glitch to not program something in the first place though).
---
Now it should work as intended, loading the full 20 bullets..... Because that's what this specific gun and the other two do. Not what any and every gun does.
---
Don't forget the unlimited fusion cores provided you log out while in armor... they 'fixed' that one right after I figured it was never getting fixed and freed up space in my inventory. :C
---
Yeah dude, the automatic receivers are trash. If you don’t have weapon artisan, you can literally only use a laser weapon for like, 2/5s of a multiple enemy fight before it breaks, and even still, the second durability bar barley helps. It’s so stupid. I have 2 furious lasers, and one furious Ultracite, at this point, I only use them in low level areas, and honestly that’s just because I have an abundance of fusion cells from living in Watoga. They are not viable late game at all. Side note, I found a level 25 explosive laser pistol, and the damage was not modified at all in regards to the explosive perk. Anyone else notice this? Surely that can’t be intentional. 
---
I had a team of 3 start attacking my base when I just switched off pacifist a few minutes before wanting to see if anyone was doing Hunter/Hunted radio. They had just normal heavy guns. I 1 shot them all with my TSE Gauss but they kept coming back to destory my base (I didn't care i have a shit load of junk to repair it with) by the time they finally stopped (assuming they realized that my base was high enough that i could see them coming from a mile away) I had taken over 1k caps from them. It was pretty fun lol
---
and for what cause are you fighting?
---
Issue: CTD / Frequent crashes to desktop, also when idle / afk  
---
IGN monokoi  
---
Xenon 1231v3 / 1060 6Gb / 16Gb RAM / PC636D  
---
I’ve been running around with every rifleman perk and tank killer thinking my gauss rifle is badass. 
---
Soooo, now its MORE badass?! That’s badass!
---
I am on a PS4 Pro, sometimes I let the wife play on the big screen and I take her slim. I experience more crashes on my Pro than on her slim. It's probably the game coded to run at higher settings on the premium consoles. 
---
I roll with the black &amp; white tux and an Assaultron Helmet. The helmet opens when you put your gun away, and closes when you draw your weapon. 
---
The beta was absolutely too short. There’s no excuse for a beta that short, especially with the time constricted nature. Because really... were beta testing this game we paid $60 for. These patch notes are shit that should have been fixed at launch. 
---
Thanks, man. I'll finally be able to move without losing all of my AP
---
It’s always nice to be properly recognised 
---
Thats fine. Thats how it is in every game. It should be a different grind down the pvp progression to end game.
---
More content. More fun. 
---
Exactly. I don’t pvp unless attacked first have no interest in hunting down other players but I don’t want separate servers. Mainly because I already find the player interaction in this game somewhat boring and I worry the pacifist one will be more boring and the pvp one will just devolve into “kill everyone you meet on sight” raider servers. They need both on the same servers so you don’t know what you are getting when you run into another player. 
---
Did they speed up the reload animation or did the glitched animation restart with every bullet? It feels significantly faster to reload all five bullets now, on top of being able to end the reload early. 
---
I think what needs to be added is “If part of a team and your teammate doesn’t have pacifist mode active then proceeds to become wanted. You are now fare game.” Noticed this right around the time I started to play the game. Had players using lower lvl people baiting just so they can get easy kills. Not that it’s hard or anything. I think what people fail to realize is yeah sure if in pacifist mode your fine. You won’t be outright killed. You’ll take damage and they can break your armor. But if in a team your over encumbered and your teammate decides to fire back your screwed. 
---
Yep fair enough I’d do the same 
---
We'll give that a try too. I'm just hoping it's a simple fix. I don't know why they didn't just let people share paint schemes.
---
Same here. Most of the doors don't fit.
---
It is now let’s do it 
---
&gt;hat was the Single shot grenade
---
For the damage perks yes, not the other, it's still a heavy weapon (like for example fatman).
---
Anecdotal evidence
---
I *do* know why, but as a player it's obnoxious.
---
Iirc today's patch forced people in pacifist to become fair game if a team member becomes wanted
---
I can at least attest that on my purchased-last-Christmas XB1 S, I get fairly frequent freezes and crashes. At least 2-3 a day.
---
This post?
---
One more thing to clean up.
---
It was supposed to limit it from the damage perks not the weight and other perks that heavy weapons use (like the one with accuracy for example) .
---
I use no reshades, ENB's, sweetFX, nothing. Completely clean game. Only subtle INI tweaks but I already saw to that and tried without them. And I double checked if I am using them or not. Exactly what i've shown on screenshots happens only in swamp region on the map. But this "whiteness" is presentd all over the game, so it's clearly an issue only fleshed out by this zone, but presented not only there. Here is some more examples i've taken while I played and stumbled upon it.

That's after my perks are taken into account too. Pack rat 3, bear arms 3, bandolier 2, travelling pharmacy 3 and still over 1000 weight sometimes. I'm level 179. Your choices are too broad to cover only dupers. 
---
The comment definitely went over my head, I’m so used to seeing people actually use power armor constantly that I never took your comment as potentially being sarcasm, my bad.
---
Naw, you can do it in game, if you want to rearrange all your perks one at a time.
---
Didn't Pipe bolt-action legendaries exist? They are still the better snipers as they get rifle and pistol perk bonuses.
---
It's worth a decent amount.  I sold a 1* two shot radium rifle for 600 the other day.
---
Do you have a discord set up for this organization? How can I join more often? How about a list of events and etc? I have demands! 
---
I aint said they dont care, they are, actualy fixing the game, slowly but realy good fixes coming up. It's just painfull to see such an enormous bug all over the game... i hope it's a bug and not engine itself or this rendering technique glitch.
---
I have the elite, which I guess was in between the OG and the newer ones, it crashes pretty often. About the same as fo4.
---
I'm on PC but it'd also be great to have members from other platforms. 
---
If your part of a team and your teammates decide to attack the wanted player. You become fare game. Even if your in pacifist mode. If that’s a glitch then something that should be addressed. But I can definitely attest to this. Part of a team that fired back and I got killed.
---
Exported the Texture today and didnt see any Black Excavator paint so im guessing this is a glitch or bug.
---
Ive been finding that regular enemies are dropping legendarys more than legendary enemies. I usually get 2-3 per run 
---
That was a different issue.
---
Hardened Mass was junk that wasn’t on the “do not scrap as part of scrap all” list so it would be scrapped like most junk when players push that button on the scrap screen.
---
They changed it so it’s like beer bottles and baseballs, you hwve to manually scrap them.
---
But being junk they’ll be destroyed if you have no other source of materials.
---
Mods aren’t junk, like weapons and armor they should never be auto scrapped for any reason.
---
If it was just a tag problem it should have been fixed by now but Beth’s response suggests to me it’s some bug that haven’t tracked down yet.
---
Auto can be fucky sometimes. Better to just leave it on area unless you're looking for privacy with your team, do team chat then. Honestly keep it on area even in group. Nothing worse than coming across strangers clearly social that can't hear a word I say. They don't realize they're in a private mode.
---
This comment section is for people who has editions of the same console. So please stand by as this hypothesis brew..
---
But if it’s no longer “tagged” as a Heavy Weapon then I would assume no Heavy Weapon Perks work.
---
Not quite but it does makes sense all the same, the Fatman is the cross between a catapult and a mortar nether of which are very heavy. But the warheads on the other hand have to contain both the explosives and the initial propellant that lunches it from the Fatman. 
---
He forgot about the one thing.
---
Fallout 76 is poop
---
I hate that load screen in the game. Why the fuck would I watch a YT video with it?
---
What system you on?  I drop 308 all the time. 
---
What level is it?
---
Fallout 4 had a lot of mechanical gizmos and production machines. I'd expect it with any robot DLC, stuff like that. 
---
Yeah, I know. But it still can be infinite even as a pile, and, what's even more important, it's sometimes nearly impossible to find a SQ's pile in a pile of piles.
---
And I never expirienced "stretched limbs naked man" power armor glitch, but this does not mean it's is not exist in game.
---
I am not sure.
---
I was in regular armor, not PA.
---
pacifist was on.
---
Was killing scorch as part of a defend quest, there was another guy there with a heavy weapon, I think it was a laser, but it had lots of blue lighting whenever it hit anything.
---
He suddenly hit me with it and I lit up like a xmas tree, kibbied in place and dropped dead. 
---
For real. Without duping, prices on serums and guns would be exponentially higher than they are now, *and that's a good thing*.
---
TSE's SHOULD sell for 15-20k caps. They're literally the best weapons in the game, by a large margin. Being able to get them so cheaply has not only devalued all other guns in the game, it has devalued your time spent in the game overall.
---
It seems to change for me week to week, it's really weird. I will struggle have have enough of a resource then all of a sudden I have hundreds of them but then run out of other material.
---
It was screws and springs, then plastic, then steel, then lead. Now its acid, I am completely out of acid and I didnt realise how much stuff needed it.
---
Have over 4,0000 caps. I sell a lot but am also a compulsive plan buyer and without any notification to show which plans I already own I do accidentally buy duplicates.
---
Those are all easy to get, you on PC? I'll trade for screws 
---
Shoot the queen with it 
---
No, there's a safe zone around the starting area, as shown by the green chunk on this map.

---
Who other than dupers has 25k caps tho
---
Has anyone checked to see if they fixed the issue with certain mutations mixed with class freak breaking Evadive and Barbarian?
---
Was really hoping for a fix on this as it’s kinda breaking my build. 
---
Can't believe bethesda still hasn't fixed this problem, ya think it'd be a priority
---
rick and morty isn't allowed to steal "oh jeez". No.
---
Just posted same thing, didn't mention how it was done though....
---
What I love about your build is we both have the same mutations besides Speed Demon ^_^ 
---
why not just jump, do a 360 spin then stab them in the face while teabagging their crumpling corpse. WHY DOES BETHESDA HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING FOR YOU? kek
---
And they still break super quickly.
---
My get rich quick scheme:  Don Hazmat Suit. Pick Flux. Sell at 5 or 6 caps each. Easy money, no ghouls. 
---
I would love this. Could be a different end-game boss per zone too. 
---
For example: Toxic Valley has Larger In-game-model Grafton Monster (ft. more blowholes)
---
So I farm caps to buy a weapon I want that is currently endgame.. do I have control over whether or not it is duped? Should I not aim for the best gear for how I built starting from BETA? It is not my fault people dupe, I do not dupe, and I farmed for those caps through events and selling things to merchants across my main and alts. My hands are clean for anything I have bought. Whether or not I personally buy will not effect anything, and only an idealist would say otherwise. That is not reality however. I play this game to have fun, and part of having fun for me is getting the best end game gear I can. It is not my fault or problem that the economy is what it is, and I should suffer no punishment for it as I have done everything legit. If your solution is that I should just not trade, then no one should trade, in which case we might as well do a fresh wipe (and I know some people do want this). 
---
Honestly the only way to fix this is to for sure fix duping, THEN make a new server mode that gives people the option to start over fresh, whether its seasons or just a new mode with everything being fresh doesnt matter. Saying to punish people who traded for items is deranged. 
---
How do you lock an extractor? Can I lock a water purifier? Lvl 19 here still figuring stuff out 
---
&gt;That’s a different link you illiterate incel.
---
I like your story, but a note. You can only be affected by one chem at a time in FO76. =\
---
I'm glad your got to finish your quest though! The last step of my first silo was much less forgiving.
---
Yeah, I have 33 luck with unyielding and level 3 critical savvy. I have 100% crit rate now with my rifles.
---
Wow your really being overdramatic. You need to take a chill pill. But hey, maybe I'm talking to the next Shakespeare. Also just a note, when your done "breaking Cody's neck like a chicken bone" your hands will be more greasy than they already are you won't be at to grab mine.
---
If I'm Beth, I'm taking this approach:
---
1. patch out the current duping tricks.
---
2. overhaul the character save system to prevent further methods from arising
---
3. render existing dupes moot(max item level increase, 5th legendary star, etc).
---
I suspect they are still on step one.
---
Caps are easy to come by late game...
---
There is no source. Every time somebody claims this, they disappear when pressed.
---
All must be same ! 
---
Why should they nerf it? There are plenty of options and ways to do things. Which allows players to discover and utilize. Which are fun and rewarding and everyone can do whatever suits them. With the high cost of PvP losing caps when dying there should be easy ways to get caps, and there are many ways. Caps stashes, tailoring, water farming, farming mobs, etc. It just depends how much effort you want to put into it. If you want to make your caps you can. If you just want a few hundred for fast travel, or a few thousand for plans, or 10s of thousands for serum recipes, etc. It's all about what you want to do and how you want to play, and there's  nothing wrong with it or needing nerfed.
---
Use combat knife 
---
It doesn’t sound like they fixed the duplication glitch. If they did I will change my view. They still haven’t even acknowledged a penalty for the dupers who literally broke the game regularly. 
---
She's your queen now
---
Psn name?
---
You do realize I fucking told you it was a different link.
---
No I forgive you, it's ok. The old me would do that yes. Thing is, hope you forgive yourself one day brother. Have a good life. 
---
Nice find brother!  I usually equip green thumb and grab flux off plants in a nuke zone.  20 mins is enough to unload on all the factions vendors for an easy 1400 exp per character per day.  I like this method as well though, much easier to do on a low level alt I think since there are some easy to get early area gold nodes.
---
Yeeeeeeeeeeees
---
I got an explosive lever action at level 45, I still use it at level 85, it's the GOAT.
---
What I am saying is the pump shotgun which does the exact same loading animation will load the buffed amount of bullets when you run it dry. Which is why I expect this patch to do the same for the lever action, and why I think common sense would dictate the same. 
---
I may be wrong, but I think step one is like getting a bubble out from under a screen protector. No matter how hard you try, there is always another bubble. 
---
Had some troll with a friend a like 20 levels higher than me hit. The troll was roughly my level, he tried fucking with me and hit me, guessing he thought if I killed him I'd be wanted and have his friend fuck me up for a bounty. Nah. Enjoy getting killed in two shots with my single action revolver. He had so much bulk, I loved it. Made about 150 caps off him. 
---
Cuz buy more copies, sweetie
---
It ruined the entire experience for me, too. 
---
Send me a message with your pan tag and I add you right away 
---
This exact reason leads my overactive thinking to persuade me not to play the game anymore because of the loss of personal value when I find something like a TSE or hit a high level and haven't done the grenade glitch at launch. 
---
Your mass crafting is probably lagging the servers just like duping. The method involves essentially crafting a ton of something in one sitting.
---
If you're ever lagging while you do it, everyone on the server is too. 
---
Feeling a little barren on perks during questing is a part of the game. You're supposed to slowly build to strength. Was an important part of the experience feeling weak and moving up to a raving bad ass.

Make a few clutch items like fat stacks of ammo, maybe throw a bit of stuff in your stash, then dump it. It will all feel like a real burden if you try to take advantage of it. Trust me, it gets boring. Have an alt leveled to 50 with about 20 from some found duped stuff. Haven't touched her since I hit that. My level 15 alt however is a blast to run through the story again.
---
Different strokes for different folks, just an idea.
---
Pretty sure they're either a troll, or being paid to spread slander
---
You think thats what we do? Wow ok. 
---
.&lt;]
---
Witch costume sell for 50 with 6 charisma max hard bargain and grape mentants, also cheaper and easier to make, Skeleton costume sell for 56 but that throws out an odd number.  Easier to make 28 witch costumes and not deal with the BS.   
---
Also the plan is simple to farm if you don't mind server hopping. Fast travel to crevasse damn load all the way in I mean all the way then look to the East a lottle up the road will be an, well I call them road events, there will normally be something there like a tank or a nuclear bomb or a tent but you are looking for trick or treaters there are 3 total but the vampire doesn't give you shit. You want the witch and the skeleton trick or treaters.   
---
Problem solved and odds are you have way way more mats then needed to make the 28 and even easier with super duper. 
---
Rather have the option for us to log into a PVP server and remove the "shoot each other once bit." If you have a bounty you can't log into a PVE server until it is cleared and players won't appear on the map for anyone unless grouped.
---
Does he have... yellow hair?
---
No, just the single.
---
What's there to explore after i have all the locations on the map?that only takes to about level 80.
---
Hmm PS as well you say. Thanks for the input.
---
Hahz fair enough. Shamefully enough we just got raided and griefed by some poor souls. I dont knwp how to set up a discord to be honest but it could be a good idea
---
Buy the guide book 
---
Most people level 100+
---
I'm somewhat with you.  It's possible, it's just not easy(and I strongly believe they haven't done it yet).  It'll take some deep system engineering to accomplish it.  They can't just keep patching out the methods, more will keep coming up.  They have to address the underlying problem.
---
1400 a day alone from vendors 1000s a day from events 100s more from caps I average 4k caps a day currently. 
---
Sometimes it bugs out and doesn't work.
---
Someone’s asking the real questions 
---
Also you can drop the nuke for the Scorch Beast Queen in such a way that she can be safely fought outside the nuke zone allowing you to wear your unyielding pieces for max damage.  Inside any other area you can still one shot everything in a hazmat suit with no issue around 50-60% hp.
---
Exactly.
---
U/I_Make_Things had ONE job and it wasn't to "forget" things :/
---
That formula's missing a bracket (it's Fallout 4's formula with "\*0.5)" written on the end), and regardless of where you put the bracket, the results come out much too low on players unless the data in the original post is wrong.
---
Damage increase values are at least roughly correct though.
---
A player perk card trade system would be cool and helpful in the early game top help players be more social earlier on.
---
What this world needs is a better class of raiders? Destroying bases that’s pointless. Track players, watch them, stalk them. When they are getting ready to do their vendor loop to get caps kill them and take their scrap they wanted to sell. Find their base When they return from a nuke zone and wait till they leave their chem station and kill them for stable flux. (Just joking they need to make changes to the pvp system but there are better ways to “raid” with the current system if that’s what interest you)
---
Well that's disappointing. Where the hell is the WV Ranger paint? Been waiting for that one.
---
This comment has to mean u don’t play with a Hazmat suite. They break in just a few hits. In a nuke zone they might break in 1 hit from some enemies. So 1 hit, sorry not more radiation protection, dead. Carrying 10 Hazmat suites in ur inventory isn’t a solution. And it’s definitely not a fair alternative to power armor.

---
That's a real shame for those folks who bought TSEs on ebay
---
i mean things about as big as my camp
---
Hopefully the player stash weight will increase soon too! To 800 or 1000!!!
---
I blame BGS, I shouldn't have to revert to low lvl/junk gear or loot in a RPG.
---
Expl shouldn't hit that hard and enemies should scale per player like several modern online RPGs do now. 
---
Why should we thank them for doing something they should have done weeks ago?
---
Bliss. ☺🙏💯
---
Euhm. 
---
I've faced mudcrabs more fearsome than you!
---
And what do you spend it on? 
---
If it was the scorchbeast queen area, you made her more difficult to kill just by entering the area. If you're that eager to help that event, kill the additional  enemies that spawn and ignore the queen. The odds that a lower level character is able to contribute an equal amount of dps to the health boost the queen gets is very low and very rare. If there are multiple low levels that join the event, most higher levels will leave since it becomes a waste of ammo since the queen won't be killed. 
---
Also watch out for assholes who use vehicles to kill you. Had a guy train a dozen bloated ghouls on me and when I killed them all he waited for me to engage some more and tossed a grenade at a vehicle nearby that killed me.
---
By one chem, do you mean 1 of each type (buff/psycho/tats) or one chem period?
---
Now we wait for the dlc!!!
---
Take your Simpsons upvote sir! All praise the ceiling waffle
---
I’m not following.  Did Bugthesda say they wanted the weight perks to still work?  Or is it just a player wish/request?
---
Well that's the thing, I haven't seen anywhere near all of the game so I wasn't sure how good this was compared to other ways to make caps. But looking at it from just my own perspective right now, I'm making a lot of caps and about 800 bonus xp just from the crafting for an hour's 'work' haha. That seems a little too easy to me. 
---
But yea, it's not like vanilla Fallouts are ever very hard. So if there are many similar ways then it's not a big deal. xD
---
I have a total of 60% weapon weight reduced from armor and have heavy weapons that weight 1.5lbs and under but a sledgehammer that has a 90% reduced weight affix? Nope that still weighs just under 8lbs and my gauss still weighs 17.5 lbs as well.. :/
---
I have one of those and it was gathering dust in my stash for quite some time. Started running low on my regular ammo and had a ton of crossbow bolts.
---
Two shot crossbow aint gatherin dust no mo'. 
---
Today’s patch? Because I noticed this long before the patch that was released today. So maybe now it’s official but this was something that happened long before this patch was released. I only really put two and two together about a week ago. But this was something that definitely happened in November/December for me and again about a week 2 weeks ago.
---
I have a day 1 and it was bothering me all the drops so I went out on black friday to GS and bought the robot white X I have less drops on the X (sometimes days will go by) than my son does on the day 1.   
---
My X only has FO76 installed.  I think it is just a matter of a packet here a pack there dropping and boom youre fucked and dropped. 
---
I am by no means a computer guy, but I believe the issue relates to a save mechanic and not losing progress if you disconnect. I think the bigger issue is to fix the disconnect issues, which they still seem to struggle with. 
---
I still don't know where I'm even supposed to find bleach dogwood
---
I mean the dense mod does the same though and it's been in the game since the start, but ppl still out there running around TSE each other
---
Yea it's all about the accessibility of this one. I got away with flux picking once around level 15, cause the radiation had bugged out... but the last few times I went in I got murderized by rads. &gt;.&lt;
---
Yeah, I move servers and block them all. I'm not into PVP...and I don't really have to be. 🤷
---
I get that but it’s in the patchnotes for the UPCOMING patch. So fear not! 
---
I’m lower lvl too on ps4. I’m going to add you, I’ve been looking for people to play with. None of my friends have this game they refuse to buy it after all the bad rep. My psn is: devlopz
---
I have started to rebuild it I posted this to inform people to be careful and don’t lose it!
---
True, but that's just straight up shit. It should have at least a 10% chance, but it doesn't. I've already ended up respecing my character to have 3 more agility and then got 3 of adrenaline instead. It's almost the same, because my weapon takes longer to break when it takes less shots to kill something. 😆
---
If youve never used a black powder rifle yet, let me prepare you for the painfully slow reload time, you have to reload all 4 barrels
---
I found out that my TSE .50 cal will melt those bases before an orbital strike would even come down and it costs only like 50 rounds of ammo to destroy everything. 
---
I have an open one set up near the water with 5 water purifiers for people to use. Damn things been leveled around 7 times, with only one time coming from a scorch beast. Last asshat who did that while I was at my camp (50 levels higher than me) learned the hard way that I can 2 shot most people with my super sledge.
---
Can we fix auto grenade launchers not being reduce in weight with ordance express or bear arms?
---
infinitely downloading/activating ash/goo piles too
---
What mats do those cost? The Civil War suits are 1 gold and 3 cloth, and since the 120 gold is brainless easy to get (take 5-10m to claim the workshop, which gets you plans and stuff too, then walk away for an hour) all you really need is cloth. 
---
That said, if these other costumes are comparable or better than clearly Bethesda doesn't mind and no nerf needed. xD
---
When will RadAway and other things with incorrect weights or that don't work with perks get fixed? When will I be able to bulk fiberglass and such?
---
Flipped situation. 🤔 And I've thought of just deleting all games xcpt 76 to see if my exp would change. Ok. Thanks for your input.
---
I wouldn't, that's a scam site. Scam, rip-off, untrustworthy site. Virus
---
remember when people were making factions? what happened to em?
---
I go to Welsh station and take pot shots at the miners below.  
---
I tried farming mutations there.  My rads got overloaded.   Took me 1 hour of spamming the rad shower to get rid of the rads and more than 1 hit point.   I’ll just save up and buy from now on.
---
I'm okay with some guns being obsolete at a certain point, like the hunting rifle is definitely one of those guns that will demolish anything early on, but later on once you're past the Forest, it should rightfully start feeling obsolete from its slow-firing nature.
---
**However**, the .50 receiver should be substantially stronger than hardened .308 to at least give it a potential late-game utility for .50 rounds. 
---
 But honestly, it'd be better if there was an actual damn anti-materiel rifle in the game that used .50 as its native round instead of relying on receiver conversions to rig an old-ass hunting rifle to fire .50 rounds and receive only a slight boost (which it actually doesn't, since hardened .308 is pretty much better in every way).
---
If you're PC I have made several friends in the game who are always down to meet up with others and spend time together. My username is heatherlk, feel free to add me and stop by whenever you see me on.
---
I just got a full clean Hazmat Suit recently, so I might poke around some nuke zones to see how that goes. o\_O
---
This is accurate, I’d just like to point out that whichever you decide to attach (rifle stock or pistol grip) the corresponding perks will pertain. (Rifleman, etc.)
---
This also applies to receivers. Automatic receiver damage is affected by commando, and so on and so forth. 
---
That 180 tho
---
Like the other guy said there are also Halloween costumes that only need plastic and cloth to make. There are caps stashes everywhere. If you learn their locations and have Cap Collector perk and Treasure Finder you can farm them also. There's also a Bobblehead that will increase the amount of caps you get also. If I'm low on caps I know a few go to places I can grab a quick few. I don't really farm them but I have done but I got bored of that routine. But if you learn where a lot of them are it's a lot of fun.
---
I just looked for it again and found it at Mac's Farm in Cranberry Bog.  It's just a regular piece of paper on the small table in the big house.
---
Right on man
---
It expires, so sell it quick 
---
I'll give it a shot.
---
This right here. 
---
Why have so many bobby pins unless you're a mentally challenged lobster boy who can't play the lock pick mini game for crap.  
---
Fuck it isn't that hard, 5 bobby pins should be enough for anyone 
---
I fired a flamer for about 1.5 tanks worth of gas to kill like 2 and a half super mutants before it broke. And to think I actually bothered waiting to farm up a little over 2 tanks worth (which was a bit of time since it's not exactly the most common ammo drop) just to *try it*.
---
&gt; You don't do those events, anymore, before then you were impacting others.
---
Oh, guess I shouldn't of been using Perfect Storm before I got my TSE Gauss Rifle cause it's such a huge impact, right?
---
&gt; I still have fun going around with the lmg from time to time and just ramboing it up
---
Go hunt a scorchbeast with it. Let me know how much fun it is...
---
Thank you Bethesda :D
---
The Garb Of Mysteries 
---
Had a guy GT was: waldfaultier some German dude, he kept destroying my wife’s camp over and over and followed us from server to server until every one in my team finally blocked him. I killed him every time but he still came and blew shit up with his TSE shotgun for no reason. People like that are the reason the game sucks sometimes. 
---
I actually noticed more crash issues and the game taking forever to show the play options again today than I did before the first/second patch. Not sure if it's just me.
---
So basically an assaultron 
---
If you are still looking for the T-45 Cal. Shocks I have one, no plans but the mod already equipped. 
---
Maybe you'll understand what it is when you're life does a 180 man. For your own personal sake, I hope it does. Doesn't mean I like you, means i forgive you as a human. Now go and make your life have meaning buddy. 
---
still farming the perfect mutation build. SO hard to get rid of Empath and Herd mentality. 
---
That works like the Hazmat Suit doesn’t it?
---
Mission accomplished!
---
Look around the internet Bethesda games are well known to have alot of crashes.
---
Damn you! You killed Dogmeat!!@!1!
---
I did read, you’ve just been berating people who don’t play like you while ignoring the reasons listed for why they want more stash that have nothing to do with poor impulse control like you keep saying.
---
You also keep asking what our true desired max is but that isn’t the point we’re making.
---
For example, pretend I’m stuck in a country run by a shitty dictstor with a large family but can only buy a single small apartment refrigerator because of said shitty government. I may not know the right size refrigerator I actually need, but I damn well know what I got isn’t enough.
---
No that’s not me comparing a video game limitation to living under a terrible government, it’s me explaining our perspective a different way since you still don’t get it.
---
In fact, none of us will know but Bethesda will when large scale complaints about stash space stop.
---
Then a 20 second long internal mental monologue from minigun guy as he tried to figure out the meaning, that actually took 2 seconds. Ends as he dramatically gasps and seems to realize something...
---
My get rich quick is Fort Definance. It takes about an hour to loot it of everything. But , if its untouched by other players, you'll get enough straight jackets to max out around 5 of the vendors. They sell for 45 caps each with 6 charisma and max hard bargain. I also usually make out with a little over 200 lbs of junk. Sell the jackets first then the next day sell the junk, then farm it again. 1 hour for 2800 caps, plus lots of useful junk. 
---
I like this idea of more wastelander looking PA sets, possibly name them like scavenger power armour made with junk and other things laying around the wastes, I would also not be against the option of slapping some bones onto our armour to be a bit more intimidating &gt;:)
---
Quit embarrassing yourself.
---
True but armor mods are hard to acquire.  Perks, not so much. 
---
There is a Exc PA paint/skin
---
Thank you so much good sir!  I will go grab it right now.  You are a freaking super hero.
---
It does? I personally don't have it, but my friend says its a outfit that gives resist
---
The bests games make you stop and wonder if this is actually the right thing to do. Often you're already so deep into them that the only way is to keep going.
---
The zooming all over the map is just another bug, seen that with friends of mine after they die.
---
I understand you're angry but don't mention their gt, you're essentially asking people to start spamming them messages.
---
Got halfway through the scourge in the forest event, paid 20 caps in fast travel fees.  Boom, server goes down - come back and the event had reset.  
---
This was in patch notes. 25000 is new cap
---
LOL, on what basis. Can't help but laugh at duper's who think that the only gear in the game is the most rare gear in the game.
---
Yep. Lasts an absolute age for me.
---
I know how to do all of that, and have recently been wanting to set up a PS4-based Raider group with things like organized fights and raids on other player factions built into it. 
---
you let me know, we'll get it set up. 
---
lol its not cause i've bought from there before
---
Still waiting on you guys to add a perk to reduce the weight of rifles in general...
---
I have a gatling laser that weighs 1.26lbs, lvl1 bear arms, 60% weapon weight recuded from armors, and 90% from the weapon itself. Its not a great weapon but when it only weighs that much its not bad to have for when you get bored and want to crank up the DPI and spin around like a mad man while shooting it to make a laser light show.
---
Is there a perforating mag for lever action?
---
ahh, didnt know if it was tied to the invincible thing they were doing. 
---
I've twice found one just hanging out in my base, and yeah, the turrets were glowing. Maybe they eat energy?
---
I put it up so people can watch out for his name but yeah you got a point. Will remember that for the future. 🤙🏽
---
EXECUTE ORDER 66
---
I ALWAYS put my spoils from Whitespring that I do not keep in the blue suitcase by the stash (the one with the skeleton on it). Lots of 2 and 3 star stuff I cannot carry and have cleaned out the vendor. 
---
Ill take the 2S 50. Cal if you still have one
---
My biggest issue currently with Energy weapons in general is that the mods you can put on the rifles that make them shoot multiple projectiles at once don't convert them over to being "shotguns".
---
There are 3 ballistic shotguns that function with the +20% Shotgun Damage cards, but nothing else.
---
It makes sense to me that when converting Laser/Plasma Rifles to shooting multiple projectiles at once, they should become "energy shotguns" that count under the +20% Shotgun Damage cards.
---
Could you edit this into the original comment, please?
---
Yea just read it http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Garb_of_Mysteries but that was kind of what I was looking for 
---
I say, wipe their entire Bethesda account with all games and stuff. Just to make an example. 
---
Sounds good, buddy.  I wish they'd add a couple more vendor factions around the starting area of the map because as a low to mid level character, you can't go east to the other vendors because of scorch beasts flying around.  So you basically have to just drop a bunch of extra stuff you coud be selling.  That is what makes it hard for me to earn more caps.  Would take forever to sell all those suits.
---
How does that work? One would assume other players would only see it if they had the same mod installed 
---
Pretty cool if it’s true
---
I just realized you need acid to smelt the gold for this idea, so it's definitely possible the other costumes you mentioned are easier to make. xD  Do let me know what they need though if you can.
---
20 caps? pfff. why do they bother with this crap
---
Yes I do
---
Oh, im pretty sure the Tattered Rags give resist
---
I think it is 5 plastic 3 cloth for either of them.  I think it works out better as molded plastic is stupid easy to come by. Go to whitesprings grab all the golf balls in and around the club house and the pool balls it is something like 140 plastic right there and you get cloth in the same place. So maybe 10 minutes of farming. 
---
Should've read better.....
---
Just to add a small point, when you press the button to store all junk in your stash it also stores you mods, so there has to be some connection between mods and junk. 
---
would not the third ability be differant on legitimate drops? i means there is a few out there i image but X-thousand with all identical 3rd stats seems a bit odd lol
---
Invincibility could be due to Chameleon Mutation and the PvP damage may have been tied to them jumping back to pacifist mode (could be wrong)
---
Ok I shall now quest to find some will update when I find them 
---
That happened to me last time. xD  I was such a low level noob I only had a couple of vendors unlocked so half my flux turned to crap!
---
Yeah and golf outfits are pretty good too. I've done the golf outfits thing, the straight jackets, now I'm doing skeleton costumes. Mostly golf outfits though as it works into my Whitespring XP/legendary farming. I've never really done the whole 7 vendors thing a day, usually just one or two vendors, maybe a few more but not every day only if I'm looking for plans or something I'll clear out all their caps, and then the 25% back from whatever I spend.
---
I just got it for PS4. It's still downloading but I'll be working on a new character tomorrow and this weekend. Interested in the Super Sledge (what level do you have to be for it, by the way?)!!
---
Message me when you'll be on next and I'll get my account info to you.
---
I'm really glad they're fixing important issues like these, but disappointed that they haven't added a way to tell if you have learned a plan prior to purchasing it. I was excited prior to beta to focus on being the guy that knows how to make all the things, planned my build around maximizing craftsmanship across a variety of item types, and found the system to be too punishing for that style of play due to that one minor-seeming issue. It might seem silly, but I've taken a break from playing because of this. I am looking forward to the next patch for it though. 
---
Does anyone know if Bethesda has referenced this as an issue, or if it's intended to stay? 
---
Rare shit I don't have or am tired of server hopping for. 
---
Tinker's workbench is a great place to farm .308 rounds. 
---
I was actually helping my high level friend as I specialise in being a medic, I just thought it wasn’t very nice of them to do what they did, and obviously there is probably a few like-minded people on this sub considering I’m being downvoted, I guess I need thicker skin, I am on reddit :p. Didn’t know that though, I guess that’s my bad, I was actually trying to go for the smaller enemies aswell, ah well, cheers for that info though! 
---
Have you ever just made a post on here to see if anyone else has/had this issue at all? I'm on PC and have over 300 hours. I've never had this issue. It looks like a serious graphics card issue. You could also try verifying the integrity of the game cache.
---
How do you get it?
---
And that doesn't change the fact that none of the atom store PA paints can be applied to named power armor. 
---
It was actually under the shotgun category 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
But it’s being moved to the explosive category. 
---
I basically do this, but with a different cosmetic helm. I give it to my alts and sell on them as well. Thats 1400 caps a day X 5 chars depending on what venders you have unlocked for each alt.
---
i guess it wasnt invincible, i did damage to him,   but couldnt actually kill him. 
---
 Nuke the site from orbit. It's the only way to be sure. 
---
I found the head once, but where did you find the outfit??
---
You have to be high enough level to use the PA pieces to place them on the frame and place the frame into your inventory though.
---
I should also add it’s even easier if you watch for the red circle to go away. The flora is still nuked and there are zero rads. 
---
Any answers yet?
---
Yes the golf course is good too for the outfits. But I lose too many frames and stuff lags too much. After the upcoming patch with the robot spawning fix maybe i will use this method more. 
---
Sounds like you deserved it.
---
The part about the stop sign reminds me of the sets the ghouls wore in the divide (I cannot recall there actual name) They had mixed Ncr and legion armour strapped with street signs for protection looked pretty cool.
---
this is exact instance happened to me 45min ago. God damn it it's frustrating haha. I gained Marsupial (didn't actually get it) Use radaway, lose Marsupial? Then gain Herd mentality right after. Fffffffff 
---
What you gonna do with a legendary flare gun? I heard all they do is make a pretty light 
---
It is 5/3 what I posted just double checked on the wiki
---
Right, that's basically the jist of it.  In an online game, your character usually isn't saved constantly.  It's saved in certain circumstances(eg logout, every X seconds).  In most online games duping happens by trading an item, getting one side of the trade saved(eg by logging out), then crashing the other side of the trade before the normal scheduled save triggers.  It doesn't work exactly that way in 76, but somebody that understands the principals has no problem thinking up ways to do it in 76.
---
There are ways to deal with it.  You can save both sides immediately when an item is traded.  You can give each item a unique identifier and check for duplicates.  You actually can save the character constantly if you really want to.  All of these methods have both a development time cost and a performance cost though.
---
What's done, is done. So why lament the fact that the game was released without enough testing, and instead be glad when a game you play moves in the right direction. 
---
I was slightly non-plussed at the lack of new content.  Reading the list though it kept going and going.  Add in the balance changes (which seem pretty spot on at first glance) and it's a pretty satiating patch.
---
Now if they release *something* new for the last January patch....
---
It's not like I stole or destroyed anything, I just looked around
---
Super mutants usually carry it at lower levels. 
---
Are you well?
---
2nd this it seems 50% faster on a fulll reload
---
Yeah I glitched an exact copy of my excavator power armor onto an empty shell, I have no idea how I did that
---
Underarmor is upgradable, and gives bonuses to stats...including your vault 76 jumpsuit.
---
Not if you’re too high level lol. Which is basically everyone by this point 
---
Yes it does, I got it on one of my characters opening up the cache in the savage divide, I was around level 13 at the time if it helps.
---
Same reason people will put 100 hours into a video game. Because we can.  (If I personally did it, it'd be boredom and bragging rights.) 
---
To be clear, I'm not saying the idea of flagging excessive quantities of stuff is bad - I agree with it actually.  I'm just saying when talking about a class of person that will throw thousands of hours of their lives into things like min maxing or shaving half a second off a speed run, "100" isn't as excessive as it sounds. 
---
Reminds me of the welcome shot of the waiters in Fight Club.
---
You could have a rolled up tent attached with a gas can of water and some tools hanging off it.  Or have some pelts and a bear trap hanging and cross it with a hunter's p.a
---
They think you're a good boy, and that you deserve a treat. It's a compliment.
---
Hardly anyone plays FO76 as is, why make the servers any less populated? You guys have seen the sales numbers.
---
In your opinion, is the age of the game engine part of the issue?
---
I can't get this to complete either :(
---
Basically no. Most outfits are just skins and cosmetic only. Garb of mystery and hazmat suit class as armour and overwrite any other pieces you have.
---
Yeah - I had something like 1200 the other day after a long expedition into the Ash Pile. It does happen from time to time - you just lose track of things. However, if it was 12,000 then yes, perhaps alarm bells should be ringing.
---
Like a movie 
---
So, let the dupers build themselves into a corner, and then send in the shock troops armed with Flamers and Ban Hammers? 
---
I mean..the game is broken though. I was playing during launch and just couldn’t handle the headaches of the amount of problems so Ima just wait it out and see when things get better. Game can be really fun but it’s gonna be like destiny where it’s gonna take a while.
---
Just ignore the haters man, you’re just feeding with this post tbh
---
This was GREAT in Grand Theft Auto 5 Online. Early hackers at online release were put into "cheater" lobbies. They forced your character at load in to be wear a "Dunce" hat, and players were barren beyond other hackers. It was just a bunch of people with attitude problems spawning early purchased fighter jets. 
---
I ended up there for a day or two it felt like when a random stranger rained money on me and I went and bought every cool car I could. Drained my account to 500 bucks but I had millions in assets. True perps seemed to get that game liscense banned. Didn't super upset me or anything. Was more like "oh... yeah. guess I kinda deserved that.... huh...". Was still just doing early quests and it seemed like you could still join friends with invites. And again, didn't seem to last long. 
---
Personally think there shouldn't be ANY elaborate scheme like this. Right now they need to nurture their player base. Yes, even people who took advantage of other people crashing stuff. Would be awful and tone deaf PR imo. Not saying I'm ok with how unstable its made servers on occasion, but really, this isn't the platform for justice court. It's like someone demanding everyone downloading a torrent be punished. Seems a little odd and murky yeah? Same with this.
---
I get the anger and feelings, but those people are likely all semi decent folk and a lot of them probably really enjoy the game like yall do. It's not like they're kicking a puppy here. Bethesda outright banned those hate speech guys and rightly so. Should people deal with the same sort of punishment for something like duping?... No... If they did something so widespread, they'd have to follow up that example they set with SERIOUS policy policing. That'd require a high quality MMO style tech service for this one game, which unless they can figure out how to make the average player spend 10-15 bucks a month in the ATOM store (clearly never its goal), the feasibility isn't there.
---
lol no that was a joke. For better or worse, I am just Arcadian Del Sol.
---
However, I was fired by a games magazine once because I submitted a negative review of one of Mr. Wright's games, so that might make him a "200th" for me on LinkedIn. ;)
---
Anyway, thank you for your insights. For those who never worked in the industry, it's easy to view everything as Black &amp; White.
---
;)
---
would you be able to equip it for me if I provide the material?
---
255 damage? Damn yooooouuuuu
---
Thanks, I have been looking around but no real reason as to why Tattered Dress gives a bonus but nothing else does 
---
Don't mind me, just appreciating your responsible usage of spoiler tags even in a different game's sub! :thumbsup:
---
Info is appreciated, No Doubt. But casually mentioning some of the rarest armor like everyone that has access to it raises an eyebrow. Honestly not trying to start any shit.

Half modded hardened lever gun does 152 i think i remember.

They keep to themselves on discord servers I think

We live in a world where each new generation is supposed to be better than the last. We expect the next version of the game to be more stable and more entertaining than the last. There is no excuse for Bethesda to take a step backward. That's what's astonishing. It's like they started at ground zero with a brand new team and took nothing from their experience in previous Fallouts. Destiny received so much shit for lack of content when it first released, but it didn't crash on console like FO76. There is no basic resiliency built in to fO76.  Destiny fits your description of a FPS developer moving into MMO is why I bring it up. 
---
Morganstown Airport is great - Scorched there usually have it. Summersville for the Super Mutants, who also use it. Both of those enemy types in the lower level areas. (So Morgantown Airport, Summersville, Horizon’s Rest, Sutton, etc.)
---
They won't. Its been too long and is too widespread. Imagine trying to sort out who duped and who killed a player and took his 10,000 cobalt flux. Or who duped guns and who purchased guns from players without knowing. And that's not even considering just how many dupers there are. The game is already reviewing poorly with a shrinking player base. As much as you may think this would be good for the game it would be a disaster. I'd bet we'd be talking about banning 10-20% of the total population minimum, and that's a generous estimate. I get the anger but realistically we just have to wait it out. I've said so in other posts, top tier will not be top tier forever. More stars, more legendary effects, higher leveled items, and new gear are no doubt coming at some point. Just wait it out, the game will right itself in time.
---
I've seen this same exact photo several times, nobody seems to know anyone who has it or can say how to get it. 
---
So I just bought this game, haven’t even created my character yet.  How do I know if I’m buying duped weapons?
---
This is a fucking ad we’re not falling for the shit
---
I'm also on PC
---
I think it gives +1per and +15rad resist, +15 electrical resist and +15ballistic / melee IIRC. You can’t equip it with any other standard armour though. I keep it in my inventory just in case all my other armour breaks and I can’t get somewhere to fix it in time. Looks weird, a bearded bloke wearing it though!
---
I also have an idea for holding a fight club/arena kinda thing. Would you be interested?
---
That’s what every trespasser says. Next thing you know, they’ve been the “guy on the couch” for weeks!
---
360 rounds if you have the Super Duper Perk and it goes off. 
---
It has been released, I think it's permanent 
---
&gt;Just stop. You're embarrassing yourself.
---
It makes some sense for people who bulk junks to sell to vendors.
---
Yeah. I definitely won’t do anything bad with this.
---
The enclave
---
Every post get a downvoted. Somebody hates this sub and has no life! Sits there downvoting all new posts.
---
I didn't mind only carrying 10 pins tbh, added some risk to them breaking. Now it's only a matter of time till you get it.
---
So here's the thing...i largely agree with you but your attitude about it is just as bad as the people you're talking about. 
---
No need to be do aggressive. People can play a game for 100 hours and still be objective saying it's not great...yet you're responding pretty harshly in this thread to some people who fit in that category. 
---

---
I wish your mom would call me back
---
That would be nice for sure, but let's say they add a hardened .50 cal receiver and it does 10-15% more damage than a hardened .308 with the drawback of increased recoil, I'd be happy for sure.
---
There's just something about a bolt action that's satisfying, especially with a long scope. The pipe bolt just doesn't feel the same, mostly because it looks like the poopoo.
---
My first choice would always be add anti-materiel, but I will settle for a buffed .50 hunting rifle down the line, and stick with .308 for the time being
---
Theres is ways around TSE padawan.
---
Yes - was meant to add that point to my original post, but forgot. Agreed that it does serve a purpose for selling junk, but it'd be great for this to also act as a weight-saving option for people just looking to store.
---
When I’m just going around farming places I’ve been before or exploring for lore stuff I’ve got a small rotation of “Ok” weapons I use just to use up my extra ammo and to save lead and repair parts for my good stuff, there’s a laser and a plasma in there. Only time I even touch the stuff. And those are always the first to go when I need more room in my stash
---
Fireproof dense mod on chest?
---
White spring Bunker where you do the clave quest as an area in the military wing with some tutorial terminals set up
---
I believe the energy damage on shishkebab doesn't stack with Strength like the ballistic so it ends up being weaker than others.
---
Yes!! I love it! So much potential for power armour customization !
---
Finish the Order of Mysteries Quest line and get the Blade of Bastet if you are going 1 hand. It has extra armor piercing ability.
---
Dude lvl 2 like 50. Makes it way easier 2 get group around then. Everyone i play with is 100+ easy
---
Happy to help, and thanks for putting this list together. 
---
Soft of they do work together but they also suffer from diminishing returns due to the multiplying factions. 
---
E.g. If I have legendary heavy leather chest with reduced carry weight 90% it’ll weigh 0.72 lbs rather than 7.2lbs, now I’ve got the got sturdy frame 2 so this will be reduced a 50% to 0.351 lbs but I could also make it ultra light which is an extra 40% weight reduction but because this happens before perks this would only reduce the weight to 0.10503 lbs (probably rounded to 0.105 lbs) or 90% followed by 40% and then 50% of 7.2 lbs 
---
Duping was patched, you say...
---
YOU CLEVER MUTHA FUCKAS DID IT! Whooooooo!!!!! Duping bitches! Take that!
---
Thank you Bethesda.
---
Well, if bethesda made their back-end right, they have logs of all loots and transactions, so, with proper tools, they can easily which item is legit and wich one is not.
---
They also said, the limited stash size, is there because they want to track down items in the game so...
---
I guess we just have to see what will happen now.
---
Why would you add the requirement for ballistic fiber on armor that didn’t have it before? Many of us choose weak armor due to not having any ballistic fiber to repair strong armor in the first place. This makes even weak armor useless. Especially requiring it to craft armor in the first place when most of us can’t even find enough ballistic fiber to repair good armor. We use shitty armor because it’s all we craft. Now we can’t craft shit
---
wym?
---
Sorry my experiences havent been like yours.
---
Pvp for me has been fun. And Ive had people attempting to grief me countless times now.
---
I dunno, Ive played a ton of pvp games and f76 is quite tame tbh.
---
Follow the main questline. It will immerse you and lead to the big show
---
Another important thing about pacifist mode: mine has turned itself off in the settings.
---
Because the glitch requires the abuser to crash their own game the previous fix Beth implemented was stopping the crash method. Hopefully it's more than that this time as it was easy to find a different way to crash the game.
---
This happened to me 2 weeks ago, my 3 star Instigating Spear disappeared after I created a new toon and then logged back into my main 3 days later. I submitted a ticket and this was their response:  
---

The current bulk mechanic makes sense to me from a logical standpoint as what I am imagining is happening during the bulking process is that you are wrapping the stuff in plastic wrap or putting them in sandwich bags.
---
Unless you get a 3star one they arent worth the trouble.
---
I love when people swing by for a visit. I assume if the door is unlocked they are happy to let you in.
---
Allow me to introduce you to a world of no power armor and fist weapons
---
server D/Cs ~6 times today.
---
That would be cool of them to do but then again there is the atom shop where they put every cosmetics on there.
---
Hmm, nah.  These tricks have existed for at least 22 years.  It's more of a "you should expect this to happen in an online game and plan for it" situation.  You can do that in any engine(theoretically).  I think it's a Beth lacking multiplayer experience thing ultimately.  They'll get it under control, eventually.
---
Had someone like me been in their alpha/beta, this might have been fixed before release, lol.  :)  I gave up this kind of thing 15 years ago, but it's still fun to mess with it when it's my job to break shit.
---
For some reason, when I read this at the end... I kept hearing in my head...  "Who rule Barter  Town?"
---
Does that actually work? is it a complete reduction or slight, because people are stacking bobbleheads to even be able 1 shot lvls who are pacifist. And if so, again. Isnt that stupid that people need to work around the game mechanics, instead of the game mechanics just working properly. It doesn't help lower LVL players, doesn't stop camp griefing and what if I want biochem mesh?
---
I will look into this though, so I have some protection when going after griefers if I see them attacking others
---
Tattered Dress is the initial firm of the Garb of Mysteries. The Garb has 3 versions lvk 25, 35 and 45. The previous version is required to complete the next. 
---
It is part of the Order of Mysteries Questline.
---
It's terrible and the mods are incredibly difficult to unlock.
---
It'll have some sale value if the legendary effects are good enough, but I can't recommend trying to use the thing.
---
Yup, same...I’ve got like a 50/50 shot of crashing every time I fast travel now... fun. 😭
---
That's a really bad analogy. Like... I don't even have feedback on how to make that even make sense. I'm sure someone would agree with you though. 
---
Just... Like I use analogies all the time and this is getting into hyperbole. 
---
But unlike your statement, he never said you "100% have seen" stretched limbs naked man.
---
FYI, what the other comment said is most likely the correct answer: make sure graphics drivers are updated, and search for people with your graphics card (and possibly other hardware) that have had the same issue in FO4 or Fo76. I used to have graphical glitches like this all the time in FO4 on my previous graphics card - every single time it was an indicator that the Nvidia GeForce Experience app had closed itself without a message (and left the "I'm Open" icon in my sys tray) because my driver was way out of date.
---
Fuck yeah spread it 
---
Make sure you have Green Thumb equipped while collecting the raw flux from plants! 
---
What system are you on? You left it out in your post.
---
Being a medic is cool, it'd be a good idea to see if you can dress the part and/or use area chat if you're able to. I'd be happy to see someone helping heal people I'd there above lvl 30. More than 2 would make me less happy though.
---
Glad that you're contributing, but be aware that being a "low" level in the queen event carries that stigma. Low is different for everyone. For myself, I view low as being below level 45. 
---
I believe 1 chem period. I've tried it myself, and only get affects from the last one I used. The loading screen rarely says it as well.
---
Just be happy that they even allow you to move special points. What would you rather see, a pay for respec? This is literally the most even way to make respecing the same for everyone. 
---
Ps4 sorry.
---
I was really pleasantly surprised by how much was on there. I expected a couple of things but it's a good amount of progress in my eyes. We're probably near enough to getting new features or modes next!
---
Although I've just scrolled through some other threads here of people complaining about crafting fuel and a particular gun prime receiver"Why haven't they fixed this yet?". *Sigh*. I mean look at the other reply you have here. No wonder they don't traditionally communicate with the community. I saw somebody earlier genuinely saying they shouldn't have been with their families over Christmas and the devs "shouldn't get a pay check".
---
How about you don’t blow up the bases.
---
Hotkey three of them and switch as soon as you shoot. Don't wait otherwise the normal reload kicks in. They should auto reload.
---
Eventually one of them will completely break the ammo restrictions and have a random number of rounds loaded resulting in a semi automatic musket 
---
It's all good. I'm on Xbox or else I would have helped you out. 
---
Interesting. I wonder if it stops showing up after a certain level like the lever action and handmade plans. You’re talking about Psychotats and not Psychobuff, right? 
---
Use the other brick doorframe! One seems like it was designed to be left doorless, but doors fit correctly in the other brick dooframe.
---
Ok, thanks for the info.  I've never really looked into modding the lever.  I can't recall finding many of them, so I guess that's why the plans are needed to build and scrap for mods.  I'll have to give it a try.
---
So do you believe the tattered dress might be glitched? Like it is supposed to replace the armors and underarmors? The same way garb of mystery does
---
One period =\
---
At least, that's what every single thing I've read says, so I have avoided using multiple chems.
---
one reason im glad i bought a tse if anyone wants to fuck with me well be prepared for war
---
Last time they booted cheaters they had dozens of articles and youtube videos made bashing them. They're probably going to be overly cautious now.
---
The codes aren't worth anything really, especially late week, but you could probably sell the cards for a couple hundred each 👍
---
The game shouldn't allow people on friends lists to take the bounty. People are always going to find ways to circumvent bounty stuff but if it's made difficult then it will deter them. Basically I think if someone is on a persons friend list they shouldn't be able to claim a bounty. And if they have been on the friends list in the past hour, in case they just remove and re-add each other. Maybe there is a better way but that was what immediately came to mind.
---
I wonder if they'll make the mirror reflect more than the void beyond the skybox.
---
People dont then, they use a website called nukacrypt
---
they are for free but people would really buy them from me?
---
Which platform?
---
What I’m scared is if any of the weapons I bought previously off of people, unknowingly if they are duped or not will be deleted.
---
I’m not really worried since the weapon I bought was an ok handmade and not a god roll.
---
I’m just confused on how the deletion will work
---
I read the patch notes for the update and it said something about fixing a duplication glitch, so yeah 
---
Yeah... it seems like a little Easter Egg to Doc Brown.
---
Oh cool cpu only, great... 😫
---
Lol!  What platform?
---
GT: krisabsinthe 
---
Yup! The Keycards are required to launch nukes, so higher level players will pay 1-200 Caps for them, usually at least. Try one of the market subs for 76 🙂
---
Trade is honestly a hard thing to come by unless you go to r/fo76bazaar
---
Outside of being a platform for dupers it's actually a great sub. I've sold several legit legendaries and my experience has been excellent. 
---
As to your question, there's no sure fire way to know if a weapon is duped or not. You can check their inventory when you go to trade with them or peek at their comments on the account they post with. Sometimes it pretty blatant when they show their offering. Having said that, the point of my post is that removing the dupes should be a priority over the losses some people stand to take. Weapons, armor, serums, pretty much everything of value has been duped in the tens of thousands per duper. Bethesda recently mentioned that they intend to add player vending in the near future. You can imagine how that will be impacted by this exploit.
---
Hope that clears things up!
---
yep had to build a ton, and still need to unlock suppresser and better stocks
---
With how many people on the internet I've heard complaining about getting falsely banned from a game, I've never actually known someone in real life, or even the people I know only through games, who has.
---
I can see it now: "H: Plan: Spring W:25000 caps"
---
This. It's still a piss poor patch that changes more positives than negatives imho.
---
It's like everytime we move one step forward we have to go to steps back and nerf another thing that was enjoyed by many.
---
Sorry, PS4
---
Cannot think of a worse fate either in a video game or IRL. 
---
Are you low LVL? At this end game, I can be in full LVL 50 x-01 power armor and be 1 shot by an explosive 2 shot, which everyone has now.
---
The problem is, Fallout 76 is not a PvP game, it's not marketed as that and majority of players don't participate in it (mainly because it broken and unrewarding), but the system allows for easy griefing.
---
Nope it still hasnt been fixed fyi.
---
I wont say how, but I still can duplicate my entire camp and stash just as before
---
Pretty much! 
---
You don't mop the floor while the toilets still overflowing!
---
Figure if they throw banhammers before the dup glitches are 100% fixed, it's just going to take longer to find any other weaknesses there might be. Which means we gotta stay in economic purgatory even longer. 
---
As soon we're sure dupping is impossible short of hacking the servers, then let the banhammers fly and the items be BURNED! &gt;:)

By being trolled into PVP, they mean having someone jump in front of you while you're shooting, so they can "shoot back" and do full damage. Yes, someone can still hound you, but it's much more difficult. I had someone follow me around shooting me for a good ten minutes, only needed to stimpack once, and eventually just rolled my eyes, go into the menus, and block them without any real danger.
---
first world problems
---
These guys were tricked out, using bobble heads/magazines, infinitely stealthed, explosive weapons and 1 shot melee.  It was frustrating for someone uninitiated to the PVP aspect.  The guy I called in has his share of the mass production market, but it was needed.  There was no way an average joe could fight those kind of tactics.  In fact...  In 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them....maybe you can hire The A-Team. 
---
I thought this too. But I imagine it would be quite difficult, coding wise, or atleast annoying enough they would never be bothered to do it.

Yes, you have to be high enough level to pick up the frame that has power armor pieces on it... *but* if you stop interacting with the frame with stored pieces, eventually it will auto pick straight into your player inventory, and then you can put it into the stash. (If you don’t want to wait, fast travel and it will also pick up)
---
I'd say make Scorchbeasts spawn to them at a high rate. 6+ per hour. 
---
Yeh it’s not a welcome bug fix to anyone who doesn’t use power armor. Which it turns out is quite a lot of people. And if you think it’s easy to go into a nuke zone without PA or a Hazmat then your very mistaken. It takes so many perks, items, and specific armor and mods that it’s only been done by a handful of people.
---
It’s about a reward/requirements balance. Here’s a quick comparison.
---
Power Armor: require level 15. has rad resistance, immunity to fall dmg, 60 dmg resistance without any additional pieces, increases carry weight, and instantly ups your Strength stat to 11, it comes with dozens of mods (including jet packs), it offers high dmg and energy resistance with additional pieces, it needs to be repaired after use, and uses Fusion Cores which are easy to obtain (although Bethesda keeps trying to nerf them).
---
Hazmat Suite: 1000 rad resistance, 0 dmg and energy resistance, cannot be worn with any other armor, breaks quickly. In a nuke zone in order to have dmg resistance you’ll also need almost all of the perks with “dmg resistance when not in power armor” text. So let’s just say more than 9 perk points required. And even then, your dmg resistance isn’t even half of what power armor offers, you get no armor mods (so no jet pack, no chameleon, not ghoul slayer, no pockets, nothing).
---
So yeh, that “bug” that let you keep rad resistance was the only thing that made this a viable option to power armor, and it was still a crappy option.
---
Nice story
---
Really, in 150+ hours you found five or six? Where? A duper's box? I'm over 300+ hours and have NEVER found any explosive legendary. I check every legendary I find and have gone to Whitesprings nukes, Uranium Fever and all the high level hordes countless times. But seriously, is it luck stat related? What is your luck in game? Mine is 9.
---
I found one in the Whitesprings garden. 
---
Late to the party but I'll take one if you still got one available.  ItsJershhhIdk1
---
What system and in game name? If your on PC, pm me and we'll stop.
---
Post title is somewhat misleading. Since vendors are capped at 1400 per day there is no way you are going to earn 1800 per hour realistically.  I get where you’re coming from I just think everyone is gonna take it the wrong way. 
---
Yeah this is a problem. Happens to me all the time. What is the point of a turret if it can just be easily out-ranged??
---
Right on,  thanks for the info
---
"I decided to troll them a bit" 
---
Seems like they got you instead lol. 
---
Yeah the contractor maxed makes it cost like 2 flux.

Oh my god am i late!?
---
 They are usually around mole men
---
Yes it does give instructions but the code part is so hard to figure out, I tried doing it on my own but in the end had to give in and look it up 
---
Hmm seasons might be cool in fallout
---
Still no fix for lone wanderer my card sits at 4 now and can't use it. 
---
Damn... killing glowing ones in the blast zone were how I was able to level up so quickly 😂
---
Did you test it? They were infinite damage on FO4 so were not available.
---
The fix for duping items is in the patch notes. I don’t know if there’s more than one glitch, but they’ve supposedly fixed one.
---
(I don’t know how to dupe and don’t care to find out, so I can’t test anything myself.)
---
I like Fallout 76 but I think the PvP should just be removed tbh, it doesn't work well with the other mechanics of the game and doesn't really add anything.
---
No, it isnt glitched. It is a broken Garb of Mysteries.
---
In the story they were used by girls across Appalachia. The tattered dress is a remnant of the Garb now. The Garb is a set of Armor. The DR/ER get better every version snd the final quest item is a necklace that makes that better. 
---
Ok I'll read the rules and come back sorry about that 
---
Stash size increase already? like 1500 now?
---
It's not confirmed that it will happen or even that it can happen, as I mentioned above. Bethesda CS has told people they can't alter accounts and some people interpreted that as the removal of dupes isn't even possible. While I think it is technically true, it most likely refers to the support team themselves and not the whole of Bethesda. They 100% have control over the data in their servers. Regardless, I just wanted to express my views towards it and address the justifications I've seen here recently about it
---
Who said it was hard?
---
Rather have too many than too few
---
=P
---
If the guy has 700 stacked exactly the same weapons, they’re not legit
---
Then mode also being treated as junk is indeed the issue, and after this long it also can’t be a simple case of miss-tagging them in the game files or it would’ve been fixed.
---
Damn, another big that likely won’t be fixed quick, I hope I’m wrong though.
---
Yeah, only people that have it installed, but it has global (all servers) channels, so it's pretty active 
---
Yea this bug has pushed me away from my gatling energy weapons. I like them alot cause they melt enemies (literally).
---
But on multiple occasions ive missed out on a kill or getting some damage on an enemy player because of that damn bug.  This guy screwed with my stuff and became wanted. I whipped out my gattling plasma only to do the little 6 round spurt. Panicked and swapped over to my black powder rifle which hadnt been reloaded since i used it previously. By the time i swapped to a proper loaded weapon he was down the hill.
---
He almost got away but i caught up to him when he fast traveled.
---
Quad Pump Enforcer masterrace
---
Or just walk away, when u get out of range it will automatically store back in inventory 
---
That’s pretty neat 
---
Bethesda probably thinks we’re a bunch of ungrateful assholes.
---
If you have explosive legendary weapon should be fairly easy to fly solo. The laser beam invisible guy just needs 2 shots. I just find protecting the chiefs quite the challenge as you have to run around and find where they are to protect. Although you can always craft a new chief if any of them dies
---
Although it wasted my shot gun ammo (I’m using explosive shot gun). All related perks maxed. Suggest you make repairs - And yeah bring stimpacks although if you can one shot/2 shot the mobs you won’t be needing to heal much.
---
They wanted to remove the Damage perks only but they removed the whole "heavy weapon tag" instead by mistake.
---
Anything over 5k should be close enough.. 
---
Hey OP
---
If someone wrecks your base pick it up and replace it down. It automatically repairs all items for you to place again. 40 caps is a better price to pay than all those resources.
---
Hopefully they can give us PVP and PVE server options soon. Let them go grief each other on that side while we enjoy the game and reclaim it from the scorch.
---
I've found the opposite.  I haven't repaired my combat shotgun in weeks and it was still at 50% condition.  Also, faster firing weapons benefit more from luck of the draw.
---
None of them are actually new, maybe they just had atom store data setup for them, but the items have been in the files for quite some time now. In fact you can lookup and see I posted a pic of the power armor skin prior to this patch
---
I did, I have max explosive, damage didn’t move a tick 
---
No problem!
---
Please post something coherent.
---
You notice he is standing still? That looks like legendary sentinel armor. And spamming stimpacks.
---
There's another random event spawn between (half way between) ohio river adventures and Lewis and Sons Farming Supply on the West edge of the map.
---
Im lvl 231.
---
It is a pvp game though? If it wasnt we wouldnt be here today. Is it a PURE pvp game? No by any means. The pvp being mentioned by Todd H. initially was a number 1 seller for me. The online aspect.
---
Anyway you need to do some research. I currently can take on 2-3 shots with a TSE and survive. Takes so many by surprise. In fact Ive only come across one other player that was running similar gear and build.
---
Only 2 x TSE you cant really survive and thankfully Ive seen noone really good enough to aim with them.
---
Now with fireproof being buffed Im dying to get on and test this with my anti-TSE / pvp build.
---
The real question is that bug or immersion.  If the sound is being broadcasted by the pipboy, aiming down sights should bring your head closer to the source of the sound.
---
I hit z all the time to drop the price to 0 when i trade people things.  I mention it because of how easy it is to discover and therefore how silly it is to have passed "QA" whatever that is.  And because it makes setting the price to 0 tricky =/
---
I’ll take the 45
---
How about flying Thomas the train?
---
[https://youtu.be/yNaTZV8qS1I?t=2m3s](https://youtu.be/yNaTZV8qS1I?t=2m3s)
---
Yup, this is the only truly safe storage method.
---
You the real mvp
---
I completely agree. Also, I wish there was a way to delete all the items they have duped and make them disappear from the game.
---
Every other guy walking around with a two- shot explosive weapon is really breaking the balance of the game. 
---
I've always believed that TSE were meant to be super-rare items mainly for use against the queen. 
---
But  I routinely see assholes at Uranium fever even one-shot killing everything in sight and making it impossible for anyone else to get loot and XP. 
---
The key word here her ***routinely.*** 
---
I'm confident that encountering someone with a TSE weapon was meant to be super rare. 
---
Thanks to duping, it is not rare and never will be again unless Bethesda deletes every duped item retroactively.
---
&gt; You can go point for point with 76 and previous games
---
Okay, let's.
---
Category|Fallout 4 | Fallout 76
---
:--|:--|:--
---
Story | Pretty solid conflict, and an improvement over 3's IMO | Mostly an excuse to make you see the map.
---
Lore | Very hit or miss. Some outright ridiculous breaks, like the kid in the fridge. | *So juicy*. Solid additions to the setting and a cool look at a time period that was previously unexplored.
---
Factions | More interesting than 3's black and white groups, but ultimately pretty stupid. Minutemen were soulless, Railroad was crazy, Institute didn't even try to make sense. At least the Brotherhood was pretty consistently portrayed. | For the most part, great. Each faction was not just coherent with its own lore, but actually felt like they were living in the same world together. Not just fighting, but trading, evolving, seeing members leave for other factions, and showing a lot of the differing types of people who lived in each group. Even the raiders were incredibly well humanized, unlike how 4 treats them more like naturally occurring wasteland creatures than actual people.
---
World | Cramped and full of missed opportunities. Glowing Sea was great, and it was nice to get a little more color, but that's about it. | Beautiful and interesting to explore. Biome diversity is the best Bethesda's ever had, art direction is a similar improvement, and chock full of cool locations that usually reward you for exploring them.
---
Enemies | Functional roster of baddies to shoot. Mostly the same sort of critters we've seen before, but in fairness, they all had to be updated for the new engine. | By far the largest number of opponents to fight, both old and new, in any Fallout game. The cryptids were particularly inspired, adding unique flavor.
---
Gear | A respectable loadout of weapons and armor, once again establishing a good baseline. | Once again taking the baseline from FO4 and running with it. So many weapons, so many outfits. And tweaking the gameplay system to allow you to express yourself with whatever outfit you like, rather than being heavily encouraged to bury it under the same armor as all your other characters, was a great choice.
---
Building | Settlements were a cool idea, but didn't really jive with the rest of the game's design. Still, it was neat and (in isolation) well implemented. | Baked into the rest of the game's systems much better, so your CAMP is truly important to your journey. Build anywhere, instead of just pre-set locations. Build up cool bases to show off to friends and strangers, instead of just building to the level of "good enough" because you know you're the only one who will ever see it.
---
Progression | It felt like you were good at everything at the start of FO4, and only got even better with levels. It was easy. Certainly not helped by how it handed you power armor and a minigun and had you kill a deathclaw at level 1. I didn't hate the removal of skills as much as I thought I would, but perks were often boring. | The perk card system is something else I expected to hate, but it turned out to be the most compelling progression I think the series has had. Every level was giving me an interesting choice on how to progress, and I felt each new improvement much more than I did in 4. I was forced to specialize more, rather than being handed the power to do everything. That's also nicely supported by the fact that my teammates could prop me up in the things I wasn't good at, while I specialized in things they weren't good at.
---
Playing With Friends | You can't. | You can.
---
I could go on (and I'd be happy to get into more detail on any of these points), but I think you get the picture. There are more categories I could get into that cover FO4's strengths better: quests and NPCs specifically. But of all the categories I just went through, Story is the only one I'd say 4 is the clear victor in. Every other category is pretty substantially improved in 76, IMO. Saying it comes up short "point for point" paints you as being unwilling to listen to people whose priorities in gaming differ from yours.
---
His on ps4...
---
and to add to this, none of these are actually new, they existed before the patch, mostly what they have done is added some more details for them to be added to the atom store, so essentially 0 time taken away from bug fixing.
---
They should use MongoDB. It's webscale.
---
So ... it applies that bonus to what item?  All items for 1 hour?
---
You win bubba. You're too smart for me. Cant waste anymore of my limited brain power on this conversation. 
---
"SOMEONE NEED ME TO KICK THEIR ASS?"
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
Thanks for letting me know, that was another success :)
---
Tried to tank you at the train station, but you were out of you body, lol
---
Ok so not Fireproof yet, but that's currently on PC and will be on console soon.
---
I dont think Bethesda cares if fo76 turns into the Bill o'Reilly of games. People will love to hate it. Will play just to find something to hate. Will buy atom shop stuff just to hate it. In the end its lose/lose. Aww sorry man, you win. They lose..... but not really.
---
Nah you can go sink hours in like I did and figure it iut yourself.
---
Its not hard by any means. Read the perks cards, test and evaluate.
---
Well...
---
The reload animation of the lever action is fixed and it reloads really fast now, not sure if intentional or not though. Not sure about other stuff though
---
Sure thing
---
Afraid not brother, we got raider / griefed so we had to put it for next week... 
---
Damn :( I did actually got it to work by going back to Charleston and going into the termimal room. If you ever want to try and get back on your old character I'd reccomend trying that.
---
Hallelujah someone thinking logically instead of whining on the internet.
---
doesn't really help much with fast firing weapons like laser gatling or plasma gatling though. just eats thru durability so quick
---
i just hate it because it's already a chore to maintain ammo, and now there's durability to consider too, and you don't even have any weapon repair kits to use on the field.
---
Ok gotcha 
---
Hmmmm 
---
The second video is intresting but remove the first one the second one shows it better. It might be an issue with server lag man. It looks like it registered the damage on your end them pop back to the original amount as if the server did not register the hit.
---
Pro tip. Never aim at the enemy directly. Try to aim slightly behind them at their feet. Only the strongest enemies survive that. Especially good at Feed the People and of course Whitesprings.
---
This
---
Do I want a balanced game before they rush more unbalanced content in? Yes. 
---
Mine would load after a bit, it would show one screenshot and then switch to another and then load me in the game
---
Sure. Sounds great!
---
Okay (:
---
Are you saying that... there are people who *don’t* walk around over encumbered all the time?
---
Who ARE these people??
---
Witchcraft! WITCHCRAFT I SAY!
---
Wow another person who got it right, took the time to explore, research and test.
---
Bang on this is how you do it.
---
Hope you have some bear arms!!!
---
I know how you feel I play ark lmao but I'm upset that this game's PvP isn't like that. In that game when you run in to trolls like that you lose EVERYTHING, not just the mats to rebuild but your WHOLE STASH! A game like that shows ppls true colors, are you the guy who likes to see ppl suffer or try to help someone who may be acting friendly only to get an advantage and when there's that to lose the sting is even worse. Just imagine the hell you could cause with a full imprinted deathclaw ;)
---
How do you get normal wall mounts?
---
I assume automatic laser rifles still break after 1 clip?
---
Really? I had my tesla rifle set to automatic, but it never helps. Maybe it has to do with how much luck you actually have too. Mine is 9, what is yours at?
---
There's a mod for that if you're on pc.
---
Yeah I gave up on my 50 Cal machine gun. It just consumes way too much ammo. 
---
This is amazing, I'm on xbox but would definitely check out a YouTube video, stream, etc. If u are up for it
---
I still don't understand the hate towards youtubers and glitchers/bug users, I can understand disappointment sure, but why not try and make some money off youtube for this kind of stuff. 
---
Let's not forget how the backend is setup and a lot of the content was copy pasted and not professionally tested, we can't just throw all the blame on youtubers and reviewers. Let's be honest here, the game is not fully developed or tested in an any expected professional manner. Let's be honest, we should expect more from software developers, but we don't right now, our desires to be entertained right now trumps our desires to be treated respectfully.
---
A lot of the game assets/code was reused without the testing it deserved and the server load dumped to an additional party for a commercial product … aaaaand a company profited off it. I still enjoy the game, I still play, but I understand where these people are coming from and I understand it's also an age where people are trying everything to make a quick buck off the internet .. both the game I play and the critics of it are trying to make a profit off me but I get to choose where my energy goes.
---
We, as a community, should rather strive to be more like the Enclave; sophisticated, reliable and models of integrity. ^(This message is sponsored by Poseidon Energy.)
---
Unfortunately it's too late. Myself and many others have allready put this game to rest. What we need now is juicy dlc to try pull people back into it
---
Ha i'm a bit old fashioned i dont post content like that 
---
You got a happy number in your comment ID! 
---
 The happy number is 208, and your comment ID was edrn208.
---
 Here's a link to what happy numbers are: [Happy Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_number)
---
 (I'm a bot by the way)
---
I've heard that the two shot Tesla rifles are bugged. I have one sitting in stash for when they are fixed. 
---
&gt; EVERY OTHER WEAPON TYPE IN THE GAME except rifles.
---
Gamma Guns don't get my Light as a feather perk or Pistol perks applied :P
---
The patch notes would never contain account actions, no development company does that. Mass account actions are always their own post. As for dupping the patch shows they determined what the current dupping method was and fixed it.
---
I wanted to get rid of a bounty really bad the other day, so I found some 100+ guy on the map and just ran up and let him smack me. He didn’t take my junk, just did me the favor and continued about his day.
---
Sounds like a terrible idea in my opinion. Steel can be mined/earned ABSURDLY quickly (lode baring/mines/Breach and Clear) and those materials you listed are useful and should be something to farm for. Plus, we would have even less reason to visit places for looting these materials if we could simply craft them with the most abundant material in the game
---
They have said they do not have the tools to mess with  player inventories.
---
Just look at this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yw30h/lost_items_gone_forever/) which says its an email from bethesda. 
---
And this [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a6c1rp/lost_thousands_of_caps_worth_of_mods_and/).
---
Pretty obvious they can’t or they would be doing so.  My guess is there is no individual coding to items they could use to determine what is or isn’t duped. Hopefully I’m wrong because at this point even stopping future dupes will likely not be enough to repair the damage.  Really they just need to nerf the shit out of explosive weapons so they aren’t god tier anymore.
---
If you are on console, the reason you are crashing is most likely due to all the dupers lagging the servers out. They have one week before they lose their toy.  So it's going to be tough for console users for a bit :/
---
Yeah that sucks. Hunting rifles tho. Lever action is great but I feel like I've been using them because hunting rifles weren't feasible
---
Would you be so kind as to enlighten me to where the terminal room is? It's been so long since I was on my old character (':
---
But why can do I have more carry weight when out of PA than when I’m in PA (Excluding Excavator). My carry weight is 230 out of PA and 215 in it. 
---
Not totally against the idea as long as i can play those songs for others in my camp via jukebox and pick what song i play.
---
Yes! This would be amazing. I wish we could name them.
---
Lol for reals. Especially with a stash limit. I tried hauling my junk with the pack rat perk, but died and regretted it. I got my stuff back, but it was a crazy battle. No longer carrying all my junk.
---
I’ve found it after level 50 at the medical wing of the enclave bunker.
---
Thanks for the inputs.
---
In the little bit of play time I've done today (cause crashes) I got a furious hunting rifle and it's not good. Idk why I expected a legendary version to do more damage though
---
Man, you know this isn't a PvP game. It has PvP aspects to do with it, but look on YouTube. You see many videos of people making videos on PvP, you see many subreddits for PvP. No. Why? Because it's not the funnest PvP system. 
---
Why should people need to have a very specific Loadout of perks and armor just so they don't get 1 shot in PvP in what you're saying is a PvP game. If you truly enjoyed PvP for the fun and the challenge, not just to beat others. You'd agree with me, because it would make everybody at a closer level playing field with some only slightly more advantaged than others. Where ability would actually come into account instead grinding to get the right gear and hoping you get the 1st 2 shots in. Where you would have ALOT more people participating.
---
Mine seems fine. My other with the charging barrel freezes the game on the second or third shot. 
---
I vote for jar of sticky tar, since they always drop one ;)
---
The Fix it Good perk is also a life savior, at level 3 it repairs armor and PA to %200 durability AT NO EXTRA COST!
---
2nd mode is unnecessary. They need PVP and non PVP. 
---
We get it. Level 25+ Armor need ballistic. Didnt need to tell us like 3 fucking times lmao
---
it does now
---
So here we are, doing Bethesda's game designers' job for free (oh, wait, we actually paid for that!) and still are humbly gratefull that they kindly listened to us? Noiiice.
---
Maybe they fixed it at some point! I'll have to get mine out and try it again.
---
Found the t51b jetpack plan at the BoS Watoga vendor myself.
---
What's the reason for ballistics fibre for level 25+ armour? I don't get it.
---
Since the servers are broken into 24 players at a time to have PVP and PVE server options. It should not be an issue to have a setting using the current Pacfist or not option to assign the server choice.
---
I would be very surprised if anyone would disagree to pvp / pve servers.
---
That's the train station one right?
---
yep seems im missing psychotats and also buffout and i check enclave everytime i visit.
---
Morgantown airport*
---
Found four there on the roof, by the downed helicopter 
---
You must be very lucky. I have 150+ hrs and only found one TSE cryolator
---
I built mine in a bayou there. It's beautiful but unfortunately my neighbors appear to be cave crickets and gulpers.

Speak for yourself, they heal 400 each and 50% hunger. 
---
No animation either. Mutations OP.
---
can someone "eli5"? what the hell is that supposed to mean?
---
Think about this everyday. Been rebuying my new skills and saving level ups like some kind of junkie.
---
 Every 10 levels past 50 should allow a full respec.
---
I can tell you 100% you dont have to buy any god damn ultracite explosive vents, ultra light marine limbs, and ivory pistol grips.
---
Yeah I think they just had a few numbers screwed up. The fusion core processor being .8 an hr seemed like a really weird number so I wouldn't be surprised if they just forgot a 0 in the Bobby pin weight.
---
250ish here, found 4 two shots, 2 explosives but never looted a tse.  15 luck here, it supposedly only effects item durability and not loot types.  I think its likely their rng system is screwy I have heard people getting multiple of similar drops so...lucky seed is lucky I guess.
---
Bastardos!
---
Perfect. How much do you want for it?
---
I'm on Xbox right now, building a church at whitesprings with atom shop door and floors
---
r/fo76bazaar is the place to trade and buy things, maybe you can find it there
---
&gt;  To make it even weirder with water purifiers, as I understand it spreads your production out across every purifier in your camp.
---
Really? At least each purifier can hold up to 5... there's always 10 waiting for me in my two purifiers when I return to camp. I started selling it cuz i had over 100
---
So no fix to energy weapons. Can barely go 60 shots without breaking and the damage is mediocre. 
---
That works for me gt endlessthreat
---
Well thank you, sir, that was quite helpful. Please let me know if you come across any other known certaintys.
---
Assuming they did it right that won't be an issue.  Any player with a massive inventory is kinda boned.  The pocketed armor bug is fixed(I think).  So they aren't moving fast.
---
"Explain Like I'm 5."
---
So I’ve been doing it wrong for two months. I am a fool. What perks buff Tesla. 
---
Pvp melee meta? Im not sure. Ive pvp'd daily since launch and if my rifleman build can maintain range I win from melee, which is most of the time. Very much depends on terrain also.
---
TSE's also never much effected my pvp, cause being invisble and at range I suppose. I honoustly dont understand how I have gotten into fun and very diverse pvp since launch day without ever being bothered by hostiles using TSE when I see so many friends using them. Even at the workshop claim area,  a cqc area where im at my weakest as rifleman, no one ever appeared to use  the TSE against me effectively. I fully believe all the claims about how these weapons can hurt the game, but just want to share my surprise that in way over 100 pvp encounters on PC it hasnt been an issue for me. Maybe many of my opponents in pvp had the weapons but didnt use them well, I dunno, but I am often, though not always, dissappointed how most players just try to run towards me or my camp while shooting, with no cover, no tactic, no thinking, like its super mario 3 on nintendo. They can have a golden 10 star legendary weapon but if it isnt delivered with a brain it wont help much))
---
Hmmm, now that I think about it, we all, us and sierra bravos, have to die *somehow*. For the sake of the lore. Either that or us dwellers maybe go back underground and choose to stay there forever? I am curious where the story will take us! 
---
I'm against it, because it's impossible to delete all of the dupes without collateral damage.
---
What if one of the weapons I have is duped, but I never knew it. I've never bought a duped weapon, but perhaps I came across one in a vendor or through some other means and unwittingly obtained a dupe. Many players could have a similar scenario, because from their point of view, there's no way to tell the difference.
---
However, something should still be done. I agree 100% on that. So do something like outclass them, raise the level of weapon drops and rebalance the game toward those higher level drops. Everyone gets to keep their weapon for now, but they'll eventually need to change it to remain relevant.
---
No, it's the super duper mart one. Watoga station vendor may also sell them, but it's a separate bot from the BoS one I found mine at.
---
How much glowing one xp do you actually need? Feel like I've been getting 680 xp on. That seemed excessive. Seeing as they're a 1 or 2 shot at higher levels. They said they did this before but I really never noticed. 
---
thanks
---
They put a bandaid on a slit wrist. Settle down.
---
I've been there a few times, I know where the magazine spawns. I'll check it again, and whenever I'm by there. Thank you, dude.
---
This. I put 180 hours into it. I liked the game. But it's not good right now. I'm holding out hope but as it stands I'm losing faith in BGS and I'm seriously considering not touching their products anymore. I'll miss out on some good games I'm sure but as has been said before, vote with your wallet. This game came out November, there has been a total of 3 patches beyond the day 1 patch. Bet your ass though that the atomic shop regularly received new content at very high prices. They left the game in a shit state before the holidays and the damage is done. I don't think the game will die because of the fallout name, but that playerbase is going to get real thin.
---
Exactly, I didn't say it had to be easy to get more points, but at least open up the option for it.
---
Lots of nice areas in the savage divide that are both near water and central to the map. I have mine just between harpers ferry and white springs it makes traveling a lot cheaper. It’s also next to a silo so I can launch nukes easier.
---
PS4. Coreyshu75. Looking for same trophy
---
Or just block them and fast travel.
---
No from a lore point of view i would say we the vault dwellers from 76 after following the overseers path. Learning of the threat and unlocking the use of the nukes. All ends in her death as we group up and down her.
---
The flee thing is just a game system bit for bad groups or if too many low levels have scaled her above the groups dps out put for the timer.
---
**Repairing**: Component quantities required to repair mid to high level armor and weapons have been reduced up to 20%. ***DevNote***: - Repair costs scale with level, and there's room to reduce costs at higher levels.
---
Long story short the dev here is saying that the higher level you go now the more it is going to require in resources to repair, plain and simple, however it's within their power to modify it to plateau or diminish in scale if the powers that be allow it. However now though an additional resource is required, ballistic fiber which definitely offsets any reduced 20% or otherwise in costs as ballistic fiber is incredibly rare and very costly.  
---
They fixed Hardened Mass too didn’t they? But not Mods, that just blows my mind.
---
Yeah, but see that's the major problem for me. I know ARK can be super griefy, but people play it knowing that and it's the exact reason I don't play. Fallout 76 isn't meant to be like. I just feel sorry for the people who can't participate in the main game aspects because Bethesda implemented a shitty griefing system.
---
You're pet deathclaw would look totally bad-ass.... till he's 1 shot by someone with a TSE weapon.
---
Oh, I didnt realize you were just contradicting yourself.
---
I only read the "There is little to no data implying people are actually buying them" and just figured I'd show you some data of people actually buying them.
---
Next I hope they fix the invisible grenades bug so I can play my first character
---
Yeah, I got a nice Lever Action for my VATs build (Instigating, 50% VATs crit, 25% less action points per shot) and can't wait for the patch on console. Also need a freaking silencer/suppressor. Have crafted and broken down at least 40 levers
---
The Flatwood monster can take control of anything that can attack and have it attack it's assailants. Hence the purple glow. 
---
It's really bad when you encounter it in the Cranberry Bog during a Blast Zone, and it starts controlling the scorched beast, the robots. 
---
How does a game that’s been out so long and released for so much money have this many bugs? Like wow. 
---
&gt; ~~alterior~~ ulterior
---
Yeah i know right, hopefully the updates will fix this 
---
As I mentioned in another comment this idea was propagated by the responses of Bethesda support reps. While their team may have no control over our server side character info, Bethesda most certainly does. Whether they can identify duped weapons/items or not is another question all together. Hope this helps!
---
PS4, but for what it means I live overencumbered and scrap every hunting rifle I get my hands on. Still don't have any .50 receivers, but I gave in and bought the mod from a vendor in Watoga. Seems like the mod is really common in those two vendors.
---
Something I don't get. Why nerf legendaries? If it's something people are doing. They are playing the game. They are enjoying it. Why take it away? In a game that seems to want to have a MTX store, the more people playing the better. The game goes on sale for less and less I heard today $9 or something. Removing content isn't a wise decision. There are so few good places to farm. But I can't say for sure if they did nerf or not. Just what a few people have said.
---
Wait seriously? I've been bulking this whole time and assumed it was lowering the weight. Ffs, now I have to go and see which items are actually adding weight instead of diminishing it. Thanks for the info, though. I'm not a new player but I didn't know this.
---
If they can’t tell/trace which are duped to wipe them or don’t want to because of people potentially buying dupes without knowing (though I don’t get that concern, I literally don’t trade with anyone I don’t know exactly cause I don’t want to risk getting a dupe...you take the risk you may also pay the price), then they should at least delete all commonly duped items (bobble heads, mags, weapons etc) down to set numbers to at least reduce the damage done.  What normal person is running around with more than say 20 of a bobble head type or magazine or more than a few of the same weapon.  If they can cross-character check within an account when doing the deletes even better.
---
I’m sick of not being able to feel safe trading cause of friggin cheaters and because I absolutely refuse to stoop to their level and risk using a duped weapon.
---
Nah being a raider is more fun 
---
They don't have the ability to do this.  The only action they might take is banning players with stacks of items that are exceedingly obvious.  Like a mule with a stack of 50 TSE handmades on it.  The items are not uniquely marked, they could add that feature now to mark them going forward if they wanted to invest the time and resources, but it's too late to positively discern which existing items are "real" versus duplicated.  Rockstar had the exact same problem and had to add a unique identifier to vehicles in order to implement a relatively successful anti-dupe function.
---
I didnt see it but did they add more storage space to the stash
---
It’s great at low levels. At high levels everything is such a damage sponge the ammo gets way too expensive to sustain, and explosions throwing bodies around make them annoying to loot, plus some people complain about explosions causing performance issues.
---
I’ve got an Instigating one, I use it every now and then, but ehh. 
---
I take no chances. When I down someone I instantly pistol whip their ass.

Weapon weight reduction gained from Legendary armor no longer applies. My weapons weigh exactly the same, no matter if I'm wearing the armor that gives the effect or not. It worked before the patch today. 
---
&gt;So glad they are still working on the game.
---
I mean... It's not even been out for 2 months yet. Do people really think they're going to dump their biggest release in years because the internet was mean to them?
---
There is an issue with either Animal Friend or Wasteland Whisperer (unsure which) not properly making creatures tame.  They still show up red instead of white and agro on players when they pass close to camps instead of being passive unless attacked.
---
Examples of broken "pets" include Deathclaws, Mega Sloths, and Yao Guai for sure every time myself or a friend has tamed them.
---
Respec is fine for me. If you want to completely change your character, make an alt. I did and I love it
---
However crafting .50 is very resource efficient compared to .308. Even without ammo manufacture and super duper perks.
---
I've only been attacked here one time. Do you have generators outside? I find that draws them in.
---
Get Power patcher and fix it good, swap them in when you have to repair=&gt; double durability for 1/3rd of the repair cost, +bonus dr while the armor is overrepaired
---
It depends on the mods really. I use the automatic so commando for me. If you use the semi-auto, charging, or shotgun, I believe rifleman works on all three of those. For some reason I feel like the arcs automatically aim for the enemies vital points far better than the player. I just know that ever since I got marsupial and started jumping and shooting at the ground in short bursts either between or behind the enemy, it seems to be much more effective. I also have three levels of adrenaline which certainly helps with crowds. I have adrenal reaction too, so if the circumstances are just right I do over 200 damage per shot automatic and I don't even shoot at the enemies. One guy at the scorchbeast queen actually asked how I was melting the enemies so fast. It's still not as OP as TSE, but it does the trick. 😎
---
My legendary armor with that effect no longer works at all. Weapons weigh the same no matter if I have it equipped or not. 
---
Also so much for people forgetting we are all from the same vault. Our duty is to work together to reclaim the wasteland and stop the world ending threat of the hive-mind and its influence.
---
This is why i want PVE servers.
---
Farm whitesprings this weekend before they nerf the hell out of it Monday 
---
Xbox user here. That's photos you take in the game, I love when I get to see the photos on the loading screen, it makes me think of the fun memories in making. But no in all seriousness, I don't like glitch out to see them, they replace the normally fallout loading screen sometimes I think it's intentional 
---
I'm still looking for marine and robot armor - no drops OR vendors. :(
---
Yeah it's a good idea.
---
I'm not saying for myself, I would want to disengage from PvP, quite the opposite. I want to use PvP more, but I want it be fixed. Because this- sometimes I win, sometimes I loose, depends end who got the 1st shot, is never fun for me. I wouldn't care if I lost everytime, as long as it felt like a fun battle. Like I actually have time to hide behind things, use tactics. Right I feel like PvP is just about as fun and challenging as a game of scissors paper rock.
---
They fixed one. Another way we found, it's getting fixed.
---
The Good With Salt luck perk helps immensely with keeping flux from spoiling.
---
This is fantastic, thank you!
---
I was doing something similar myself so can add a couple things :
---
Two recipes your definitely missing are Cramburger (not sure where I found that) and Megasloth Mushroom Soup (learnt when you collect the mushroom from a Megasloth). Two that I have seen mentioned online but I haven't found in game are Chitlins Con Carne and Owlet Nuggets.
---
As others said Ginseng can be found in Whitesprings and Dabney Homestead Workshop in The Mire. I think there were 2 at the Ingram Mansion - the 1 on the left as you approach and then there is 1 directly to the right of the house, between the house and the cliff face.
---
Try Uncanny Caverns for Cave Crickets
---
There is a house/shop in Helvetia that has a heap of honey and honeycomb.
---
The kitchen at Bolton Greens has 3 recipes laying around, not sure if they refresh though. Also the Raider camps in Savage Divide quite often have one, although that might be easier for higher levels.
---
Just out of curiosity - did you make the Iguana soup? I was wondering if it was supposed to be made with Iguana bits not Squirrel bits. And if you remember where you found the Mud cookies and Tato salad surprise I'd love to know!!!
---
This confirms that you were all QA testers for the game. But instead of being paid, you paid them.
---
what?
---
If they fixed the damage ratio, I would totally be jumping on the PvP server alot of the time.
---
Frigging barbed walking cane mods are like a plague upon the world. Worthless shite
---
&gt; You 100% saw it
---
Nope. You seem to be the only one.
---
Yeah, I had one but decided to get rid of it in favor of my double tesla instead. You csn definitely see the extra arcs with the two shot, but it only does 2 more damage than standard. 😐
---
There is no hardened .50 in the files.
---
However refined/hasty give a damage boost to match hardened .308 while also a minor buff to accuracy or fire rate. Critical .50 has higher base damage than cretical .308 with the same large boost to sneak attack, so it is slightly better as well.
---
I'm guessing severe .50 (damage + crit) would be ideal but I've not seen that in the datamined lists either.
---
So thats why people keep doing it, i only ever see whitesprings and the lower right of the map being nuked, never knew why till now.
---
This is good information, but I was not moving my base just because some asshats destroyed it.  Then again, I was not rebuilding while they were around either.
---
Yeah, grab a friend let them get downed and revive them. If you have no friends, use pvp. But they will be patching the ability to revive players you kill in pvp, I think. 
---
There's a cave with several.
---
Seems to have been slown down with a few changes. But rumors float that it is still currently possible just slower. Due to it relying on the server save when someone crashing.
---
This mean i can finally get handmade rifle plans?
---
they said in the patch notes thread that they are putting known recipes in a future patch so at least confirmed to be fixed
---
Lol - that escalated quickly
---
Hmm ok.
---
Hello, I am a granmar nazi. And I am here to inform you are using "Fix" incorrectly. The appropiate word to use is "Change" since "Fix" implies Power Chassises not displaying what armor is on it is a bug or a glitch when in reality it's designed to be that way. You should say "They should change Power Chassises so they say what armor is on the Chassis."
---
~~^I ^am ^not ^a ^bot. ^I'm ^some ^random ^guy ^who's ^bored ^and ^nothing ^better ^to ^do ^than ^be ^a ^grammar ^nazi~~
---
Yeah. It’s quite possible Bethesda Austin got a raw deal, but thanking them for *continuing* to patch, like they’re modders working on a passion project?  Come on, guys. 
---
Yeah I prefer the psychobuff over the psychotats so yeah def. certain cause I was pissed.
---
Ya thanks for making your game you charged me $60 for, 10% more playable.
---
I'm hoping some day they add the ability to just add legendary effects to weapons, even if it still ends up being a grind to do.
---
No problem! I'm a solo player so I will always make a post about starting one up. Yeah I disappeared for a bit after we finished it up lol
---
Idk about that one. I know ones that have related perk cards only stack so much. Like one that will reduce ammo weight only stacks to a point and becomes useless if you have bandolier equipped
---
Also, you're totally right about the fireproof improvements. I'll need to check that out incase I come across some griefers
---
lmao it's like you've never played a newly released mmorpg
---
&gt;There was a post yesterday about killing all the scorched leaders that spawn under SB, forces them to land. Tried it last night, seems legit.
---
Intresting. I'd thought everyone kills them as they pester you with damage and spot you.
---
It is....well can be its in the patxh notes recently released.
---
And yet, when you mention it like this, this sub will downvote you to eternity because if it's not blatant Bethesda supporting Positivity, it's obviously because you hate the game.
---
ha u joke but yes pls, it would b a nice change of pace and alot more challenging, as of now a legendary enemy is just a norm but with more health and some buffs, booring id love 2 randomly come aross a supper mutant with some op axe than one shots me if i get hit or maybe a ghoul with a two shot flamer flamer! eeeepic yes pls i cant kill it? i must not b strong enough yet, or maybe i should use a diff method on this enemy? ass loong as there not spam blasting aoe auto locked stealth breaking mothras ill b happy .
---
Yeah... Exactly mainly cause serobi is a duper and I like to fuck with dupers need proof? check this out:

Also on destroying tinker's base. Honest mistake on my part thought one of my guys started shooting turns out it was a random person shooting at me (didn't learn this till after the fact).
---
It’s on small trees in the toxic valley. Green thumb also affects it.
---
Some of the .50 receivers like refined match hardened .308 for base damage AND get the accuracy buff. Hasty is similar but gets fire rate. They are slightly better.
---
Critical .50 has a higher base damage than critical .308 with the same crit bonus so its a slight improvement as well.
---
Gotcha.  Im a week in and half the time im not sure if the game is bugged or i am just missing something.  Seems to be a little buggy but pretty good so far.
---
I played Everquest when it was owned by Verant and quit a year after Sony bought it out cause the made the game unbalanced
---
So when I use med x, psycho, buffout it just uses the effect of the last drug I used? I wasted so many drugs...
---
Well, I have 3 armor pieces that gives me weapon weight reduction. But even with all of them off, the weapons weight don't change at all. 
---

**That's hoe mafia works**

&gt;When this horrible looking bug will be fixed, I will be able to finaly say developers care about their overall game state
---
lol wut
---
You'd think a simulation would be able to progress pass reclamation day &gt;:)
---
I must do this with flamingos...now that I finally found the plan for them! 
---
Its buggy but enjoyable not my fav fallout but one I can play with freinds and that alone gives it huge point's. GL!
---
I find it good to swap servers after blocking them. Then dropping it down again in a spot then back in its normal spot to repair all damage. Again huge fan of the pvp and pve server idea.
---
What system you on. Always looking for more friends
---
I'll try to break it down for you being you're most likely a Glitcher (A.K.A. cheater) yourself. A server is set up to process a certain amount of information. When this information spikes by, let's day duping a few hundred thousand bobble heads, the server becomes unstable and crashes with everyone on it. Now by these YouTubers promoting and encouraging horseshit for a profit they screw over others who just want to enjoy the game with out cheating. If this were a free to play most of us non-cheaters would just weather the storm but we all paid for this game, including Cheaters (I'm not using that fucking term Glitchers).
---
Despite Bethesda's lack of quality control of their product, it doesn't excuse these greedy back door peddlers. So because Bethesda released a dumpster fire of a game you're saying it gives these guys the right to not only pour more gasoline themselves but supply free gas cans to their followers? Use your brain dude.
---
free flux you say? on pc?
---
I was disconnected twice in one hour and I've just given up. I've only ever had three other server not responding in all my other playtime....and I've been playing since beta so....I'm not happy today. 
---
Tonight is the worst it has ever been in my experience with 76.  Seriously, Bethesda.
---
Aha! You’ve just proven you *can* do glass, Bethesda! In that case I shall be expecting an alternative to all those broken window wall pieces in the future. 
---
How the hell can people get 150 turrets? My camp had like 6 and the budget is maxed out
---
Healing factor and carnivore are at my disposal so I don't need the health regen from them and can eat the ionized meat I've hoarded for purpose of hunger.
---
Now if it granted the ability to mutate and sprout out wings... that's a different story. Mursupial+Bird Bones can't even compete with having wings.
---
I agree.  I'd much rather they fix their damn server disconnects before pushing new policies like this.  Tonight was the worst it has ever been in my time with 76.
---
Well, it's basically impossible to fix dupes completely if you keep reversing all changes in a character's profile when he's getting disconnected. I don't know how it's done in details, but I can imagine that you drop a weapon, someone pick it up, you're getting disconnected hence refunded -- voila, two weapons exist. And since they're still making these "refunds" after disconnects (I already got disconnected few times so I know that it still works that way), dupers are not fixed.
---
Cant watch that currently at work could you give me a run down.
---
Who hurt you?
---
I thought about that also, that it might of been a freak accident, but they were looking at the bag. If I don't need something I would drop it at overseer's camp or Flatwoods. Still they really weren't worth taking if they did.
---
Wrong. Dupers can, and do, use bobblehead stacking to get absolutely insane damage, and even without that TSE weapons can kill people in seconds even through slap damage. It's a rampant problem. 
---
Nothing but server disconnects every 30-40 min. Three times now in the last hour and a half after the PC patch. How hard is it to get this sorted out Bethesda?! 👎🏼
---
I've been holding onto a decent legendary lever action for over a month now just waiting for this change to come in so I can replace my hunting rifle.

Deathclaw Island

Its pretty broken, less so during the day, but still pretty broken.  My sneak build has full agility, sneak perks, and armor that makes me harder to detect.  I've walked dirctly in front of the scorchbeasts in glassed caverns without breaking stealth.
---
Damn Im so lost again...so lost hate this place! Still lost where the f do I go? Theres no marker. Oh there! There there there there there there there!

Whike this reply is hilarious, I just thought I should mention that it doesn't trail off at all below the knees. It is white at the knees (like fur) and then black the rest of the way down (like leather) to look like Santa's boots.

I’d love to watch these fights! I’d love to bet and be apart of a crowd!

Pretty happy about the lever action reload animation fix
---
Stand at the main spawn into whitesprings and someone will always come blast you with something explosive.
---
No man’s sky 2.0? Or to soon?
---
This would be a cool idea, I always figured they would code the flare gun in this game to act as such. 
---
Fair enough,I can’t see the imgur images but anyways.
---
If it’s just an honest mistake I can see the annoyance from your point of view.
---
So many questions... so few answers...
---
Ask away my friend 
---
I wonder if it's lighter using the shotgun perk still.
---
Fallout has always been about taking the time to build yourself up and be super strong. 
---
Unfortunately if you are new to the mmo genre, this has always been the case. If people want to particpate at the highest levels then they to can go farm and timesink to compete.
---
Its one of the biggest arguments of fair play in all mmos.
---
The early birds get the worms and everyone else has to deal with it.

I don't get why people don't just load the playlist on YouTube and play it in the background. Not looking keep we have a host you'd be missing out on .

Literally the only issue is it would get quieter during dialogue etc.

Go listen to old world radio on YouTube. 
---
I feel like Beth isn't going to to bother licencing them, esp if they have to pay again to use songs they've already used in other games. 
---
Yes
---
Hey should I still not buy this game or is it okay for me to play it?
---
I'd agree with a grandma nazi here.
---
I have 3 armor pieces as well with it but im at work for the next 10 hours so I'll have to check on when i get off myself.
---
Not totally true. People could have earned the serum recipe from the SBQ and gathered materials to craft a bunch also from doing SBQ. Couple that with maxed out super duper and constant grinding and it is very possible (though rare or unlikely) that someone could craft up a hundred of a serum type or two
---
I haven't tried cause I'm not into this sort of stuff but I know 3 ways to force a disconnect which it apparently required so it's only a matter of time if they didn't really fix the method in code.
---
Duplicating creatures so far seems to have been fixed so maybe there is hope, they may have actually altered code this time.
---
Also I accidentally stumbled upon an XP bug now where I gained multiple levels consecutively, literally one after another, thankfully though I found a way to stop it. I really wish they would be more focused on testing in house.
---
Only if this bad boi gets a Machamp-like speedo.
---
I wonder, would his power armor paint give you blowholes on your back, or a speedo?
---
Lol that's the plan

Vendors are bugged. Their caps prematurely drops to zero if you exit their screen and go back in. I actually thought I depleted their caps but I was able to sell them more bulk despite being at 0.
---
Same here. Saw one tonight at the medical wing.
---
I found it but it didn't prompt anything ):
---
I miss English.
---
The flat woods monster is an alien?
---
I always wondered why they changed nights i do miss that darker night.
---
Unfortunately that’s probably not going to happen. They’ve taken way too long to do anything at this point.
---
meh
---
Yeah, I hate it. I wish my perk cards would stack with legendary armor effects. Would love to make a thousand pounds of scrap weigh 50 pounds. 
---
I stand corrected, the Ornate stash box is new, for some reason im sure i saw something similar, but comparing old data to new, the ornate container was added in this patch. Also two more Stash containers were added as well. Princess castle theme and Unstoppables theme

Cody. Osborne.

Yeah the whole decoding part left me confused and now I just hop into zones when they're around. 
---
The problem is that we don’t know if the weapons we bought were duped or not. In 136 hours I’ve looted one 3* legendary. I have 14 luck and usually get 1* leather armor even from 3* legendaries. I bought a TSE LAR off the market, and I’d love to trade it for an Instigating, AA, or Furious LAR, but I’ve also never seen a legendary LAR drop. 
---
That's how mafia works /s
---
That's the M79 grenade launcher, not the auto launcher. The auto one is pretty fun, I'd probably pick up ordinance express just to use it, but not when the gun weighs 20 lbs. 
---
Lol I'll never forget the first time I saw "Defend the munitions plant from a Scorched Beast attack" I looked at the corner of my screen. My wife read it out loud. We both said "you can have the damn factory".
---
Ill shoot you a message when I hop on
---
You on pacifist? Cause you should be 
---
Maybe the real BoS is the friends we made along the way.
---
I pity the tool!
---
Took you that long to be done? Most of us we're out after the duping craze, especially combined with new game modes that cater to them instead of fixing the game. When the only positive from the new patch was the bobby pin weight reduction, that shows how much Bethesda cared about us.
---
I have it on a One S and my roommate has it on the original XB1 and he crashes more than me and has much worse fps.
---
Lol cya 
---
Thanks mr todd
---
Cool. I didnt think the flat woods monster was special when I fought it, other than its dot laser beam, laser slap, and teleporting. But I've never heard of it controlling turrets
---
I can’t fucking find it

I’d like to hear the way around them

You couldn't solo your Massive **Multi**player game? That's a real drag.

Hey, message me their GT's and I can give them a fun time.

OH SHIT this is the most important fix in the patch and it wasn't even listed!

That was beautiful sir/madam

Its bugged, just stand near it get the scorched to shoot it until it breaks.

Lol. I’m pissed. I just lost 800 .308 rounds to the stupid feed the people event...

I hope at some point they add more quests and the ability to type in a chat to communicate

I'm having the sama issue.  I've got 2 pieces of wepon weight reduction amor, but they are in my stash now because of the bug.

It seems like 80% of the time it works as intended. not sure what triggers that bug though.

I don't know if they did, just a few people mentioned it. The OP here and another said they did 8 runs of Whitespring and got like 2 legendary items. I don't know as I'm not on PC so I guess I will get the hardcore farming done leading up to the console update. I did the same when they "fixed" being able to store fusion cores on the chassis. Farmed a bunch of fusion cores and stored them on the chassis which still held them so at least they didn't program it to completely wipe them. I'm just about down to the 3 where it will become less heavy to just carry them without the chassis. And now fusion cores no longer recharge when you log out. I liked that "bug" but I understand it being fixed. It makes fusion core workshops more active. And I understand the chassis one being fixed even though I used it. But if they have nerfed Whitespring that's gonna take the fun out of the game for a bunch of people who like to farm there. But even if they did I also understand it, they want people to launch the nuke and farm the glowing ghouls. People already do that. And they get better loot. It's balanced because you don't get the best \*\*\* loot from just farming Whitespring, but you do have a chance to get something good from the quantity of loot dropped.
---
I don't see why you have to get all conceited in this. I was simply saying it could do a lot more than just be a food item from a dragon that only drops food and bones. Many players have carnivore and healing factor, they're not hard to get at all so there's no room in there for arrogance from me.
---
Sidenote: I have exactly 3 Endurance xD wish there were more points to put into it haha, it has some really nifty perks tbh.
---
But resist picking up stuff. Hundred pounds later I am walking to vendors to sell
---
Yeah... you're not done. I bet you'll be back.
---
Imagine if you made one your pet?! You could breed them oh wish that were a thing. 
---
" . Your character is (was) more capable than it should have been. " u say this when the devs, tolerated the tse shotguns and with that u can 5shot the scorched queen...
---
Oh no, you must have missed the part where we can’t scam full power cores by changing servers.
---
Feel like players are really scared of ambushes. Would be cool tho. When player vendors cones out I could see offering my rescuers a discount or free items from my shop. 
---
I use a single. 50 cal when fighting the scorchbeast queen and it doesnt break (I repair it with 2 star repair perk before I go into battle)
---
This apologist stuff is crap.  People knowingly exploited the game in a way that (again knowingly) subverts the server stability, ruining the game playability and balance for everyone else.  
---
I've been hearing "exploit early, exploit often" since AC1.  My opinion hasn't changed.
---
Screw 'em.
---
Someone gave me chest and arms for marine and chest and legs for trapper. Or vice versa. Either way, a physical plan does exist. Nothing for robot yet though
---
With all of this games faults. 10 caps is what pushed you over the edge?
---
this fature still not changed...
---
Yea some of us don’t enjoy conversing with smart ass children. 
---
There are lots of things they can do, like take a hard look at users that have excessive amounts of items, like people with 1k+ stim packs etc.
---
Also, I have mentioned this before. All they have to do is fix the dupe glitch, but make it seem like it still works. Except it also records the players doing this.
---
Let that baby simmer for about a month, then BAN everyone exploiting it.
---
Do that every once in awhile and people will get the idea that they are gambling by trying exploits.
---
Hell if they were really crazy they could add honey-pot exploits just to find dick weed dupers and ban them. That might be a little excessive but as someone who likes this game cheaters really piss me off.
---
Well we havent got a betting system yet because we dont have regular fighters yet, but we will! 
---
Sure but i would never harm another unless it was to defend another from them. 
---
Meanwhile roleplaying it as normal in Fallout game just does not make sense. But i understand the want for pvp as some really enjoy killing other people and their bases. I prefer to have a pve / roleplay option for us trying to go from what we know.
---
We are all from the same vault and are the best and brightest. We have our mission to worm together to reclaim the wastelands and end the threat of the hive mind.
---
Yup
---
So does that sound like an issue with a multiplayer based game or more of a personal one?
---
God this whole thing sounds like a blast, I’d love be a part of the process.
---
That was for the  M79 Grenade Launcher.
---
From the patch notes:
---
&gt; **Weapons:** M79 Grenade Launcher is now considered an explosive weapon in perks instead of being incorrectly considered a shotgun. 
---
I am not a bug user or cheater I prefer MMOs in general and really enjoy a more or less level playing field.
---
All I'm saying is a company made a profit off of bad code and reused assets not fully developed and not professionally tested … so in order to accept that you should also accept that people exist and are going to try and make a profit off them and taking advantage of their mistakes and/or abuses.  
---
Create a fake region for them to log in exclusively with other cheaters, or turn all their dupped items into an item called "chicken confetti" or some ridiculous crap like this. That way they still get to play the game they paid for, but will either be put only with other cheaters or see their cheats come to dust in their inventory.
---
They didn't have to. Like many game companies they could have ignored us and just done whatever the hell they wanted. As sad as it is, a company actually listening to their customers like that is rare. 
---
I had a 3 star radscorpion and 2 diseased radscorpions give me company.
---
Fixed for the combat rifle at least.
---
Well hopefully depending onnnexts weeks update we wont be griefed and we'll make participations regular and public again. Hopefully i'll oost next week! 
---
But bounties take from your personal caps lol so you better be close friends with the person to do that
---
What is the point of slap damage being a percentage of damage done? If they made slap damage do 1 (or 0) damage per hit, would that solve that part of the problem?
---
All three things they said they fixed happened to me in 20 minutes on PC. Got stuck in pip boy. Went back to menu to load in and got infinite loading screened. Then crashed 5 minutes later.
---
Like I commented on the patch notes, I really appreciate these folks listening to their community and working hard to make the game better despite the poor reception. It's a hard job, especially if the corporate guys and majority of consumers or reviewer/influencers aren't happy with the game reception at launch. Working hard for the community which I would imagine is relatively small? Hell yeah guys. 
---
basically this game is just a joke.
---
Sorry, but how many patches now? 
---
Seriously. This sort of thing is ridiculous. 
---
I personally got bored with this game a few weeks back, and this is the first time ive been back to take a look at stuff, and while its good they are fixing stuff, its just, IMO there is WAAAY to much that this game needs fixing that will ever be addressed. It just took me 90+ hours to realise. 
---
Hopefully, when that patch hits.
---
I like it 
---
Now I need to find a lever action rifle.
---
&gt; When the only positive from the new patch was the bobby pin weight reduction, that shows how much Bethesda cared about us.
---
-2/10 for effort.
---
If they add blind folds you'll never have to see any of those glitches
---
Bloody Mess
---
Because i am a bloody mess...
---
Same, made me stop using mine for a bit. Upside being i got to get ammo for it lol. 
---
Or maybe even "known" and "unknown".
---
Crazy right.
---
I think me and my friend were in that cave, the glassed caverns, where we were pincer attacked by two Scorchbeasts.
---
Hey man, that freed up 2lbs in my inventory, priceless!
---
Hoe Mafia
---
where is the rpg part? is a sandbox gambling lootgame, when u have a pretty low storage capacity.. so wtf.
---
If everything else was as good as whitesprings then yeah nerf things to make it equal. As long as it's equal. Fusion cores tho I never had a problem with. Never ursed the generator or recharger thing and never had a problem. 
---
With batteries included or power user equipped I never really go through them and have maybe 20 at any given time. 
---
Reducing their spawns could suck big time but we'll have to see. Though checking power armors and prewar generators every time you see one works for me. With batteries included they weight .3 pounds.
---
They keep reducing rewards and stuff claiming it wasn't working as intended. It's a pain in the ass when they change everything... Showing nothing worked as intended at launch
---
Honestly not sure why mods can be broken down at all. I dont get why anyone would want to. If you dont want a mod sell it. 
---
 Sweet thanks y'all, I've done the responders and BoS but haven't touched enclave yet.
---
You aspire to be an old art teacher?
---
Really? I check the medical vendor every time I log in and I’ve never seen it. I’ve seen paychobuff, but not psychotats 
---
where did karen take the kids
---
that level of nerd, and also working for bethesda. 
---
To answer your last question: You dont need to bulk ballistic fiber because you can sell that to vendors as is (same for a few other items).
---
It makes sense that it would provide a weight reduction from a qol perspective. 
---
From a RL perspective it doesnt, but thats why its a game and ammo you can turn perks on to magically make certain things weigh 90% less
---
At least we only have to remember to bulk two things, and not 10.
---
What gets me is how dupers are actually making irl money from duping, not a caps only market. Making more money than Bethesda in their own game I'd imagine.
---
 I'll try my hand at it but will probably do the same, it's just the actual getting to the "launch a Nuke" part of the story
---
You straight up tip the guts out with your hand instead of falling to the floor to eat. Then add the meat to your inventory after grabbing
---
well there is your problem. Using the internet is basically checking the box that says "You agree to be, chat with, and take abuse from angry children who always know more than you, and nothing at the same time, and who have or will fuck your mother."
---
Okay thank you. Now I feel better asking around to see if anyone has one haha 
---
*quicksave intensifies*
---
I know, right?  How many PA you got?  One for go, one excavator for cleanup, what else you want?
---
Oh, I forget that my level of sarcasm doesn't translate well into text. I apologize. 😆
---
Youre missing every single rare outfit
---
Yay, another XP nerf. Let me continue not playing since they're really gonna try to make me grind out my 3rd character even harder.
---
Gonna miss topping up my fusion core between sessions....
---
Believe me, plenty of people 'like you' were in the beta, Bethesda just didn't give a shit to listen.
---
......Mayhaps......are you a lost soul in need?
---
Sorry you cant play a game without using unintended duplication glitches. 
---
There's ginseng in the flower house of whitespring
---
And some people just want to watch the world burn. 
---
War, war never changes 
---
He he 
---
Toss a grenade at whatever they are killing.   
---
Nothing like killing a three star legendary only to have the body blasted to who knows where by someone chuckling grenades and being unable to loot. 
---
Not sure why the downvotes, over half of these patch notes are things that shouldn’t have made it past beta or even 1 month after launch to be generous. No news of new DLC in sight. 
---
And they still didn’t even mention energy weapons, did they? 
---
There's some exploit having to do with setting it straight on the ground and not on a foundation then storing it or something. I'll try to find the post that i saw taking about it
---
It would stop people stacking bobbleheads to make dmg output to be able to 2 shot pacified players.
---
But not to stop griefing on camps
---
And the PvP still would be a game of scissors, paper, I shot you 1st
---
They should have listened last year before it launched with no testing. 
---
All hail the mighty Mothman. Now my power armor can finally reflect my true allegiance.
---
Yeah, it totally just does not fit. I saw someone say that it makes it feel like a commercial for the video game - and that is definitely the vibe I get.
---
I thought blocking only lasted until the end of your play session? 
---
[I made a video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/TT9B0q3JuYE)
---
Would be amazing if they updated 4 with the fix too 
---
Excavator should get the only Mistress of Mistery paint job, prove me wrong.
---
Agreed.  Fix those two, and start adding more C.A.M.P budget and placeable decorations.
---
Looks decent
---
Like bad sport servers in gtao. I like this idea!
---
Im not sure if it's as useful as it is in game for you
---
Wolves. Lol. That's a nice euphemism for ahole.
---
I love my lever action TS... Cant wait for the animation patch going to be so much smoother
---
Yes, eventually you just can't take anymore bull.
---
Green thumb lol
---
I'd pay 50 caps maybe. If you had hundreds then I'd buy em probably. It's just watoga has like 5 power armor suits and generators which all could have fusion cores. A fast travel there would be no more than 50 ish caps from anywhere. 
---
If laser gattling we're more durable and powerful then I'd probably be in the market for some 
---
This patch really upgraded the performance even on my little old potato. The mouse/looking moves so smoothly it gets disorienting at times
---
I could live stream the uninstall.
---
XD
---
Yeah I really wish they'd fix em. I would combo energy weapons with melee in the previous games. 
---
ooooh hahah, i understand now 😂
---
Ran into a pile inside Tarangra Town’s tree. 
---
Andromeda wasn’t an Online Service™ though, was it?
---
Lots of positives in this patch tbh. Basically nerfed explosives in PvP with the explosive resistance added to the fireproof perk haha, maybe now my gun won't kill me either?
---
Never happening, they don't monitor inventory
---
Thanks for increasing the fusion core generators. It's tough to grind when you only have 30 min a night to play. (Toddlers and self employed) great changes! 
---
I play the total opposite to you. I like playing as a sniper. I like the stealth of it and the approach it brings to every encounter. You look at every situation completely differently to a heavy weapons guy, or a Melee guy. And the cherry on top, getting a headshot from long range and everybody near them being non the wiser brings a satisfaction other builds cant give me. Also bounty hunting wanted people on the server is always fun lol.
---
\&gt; Trading a...balanced...PVE
---
Balanced PVE - \*\*\*not gonna happen until there is no such thing as "TSE".\*\*\*
---
Or, they come up with some drastic balance changes.
---
Yep glassed caverns should be several. Nice place to farm stuff.
---
Mine is due to the Speed Demon Mutation. But it has seemed a bit faster lately on the water.
---
I loved your last post! Bookmarking this one too.
---
I guess people downvote the truth. OP is clearly lying.
---
How can someone be killed with slap damage? I have an insane TSE gauss rifle that deals 1400 DMG and I've shot at players lvl 20 or below and it does absolutely nothing to them.
---
Sure thing Todd. We'll buy all your stuff. Just lemme take a look at your prices... 
---
The bigger issue is how frequent we're able to stay in our Power Armor due to the abundance of available fusion core.
---
Today's patch balances it out a bit more, but I would think their philosophy with Power Armor would be more decision-making based on the dangerous situation in rather than being able to leave it on at all times.
---
Once thats balanced out, The cannibal perk gets an indirect buff
---
No clue:(
---
Nah some nice person probably just offloaded it there for newbies
---
Fuck em for not testing this game 
---
That would suck any tension or sense of danger out if the game. What level even are you 
---
Someone kind put it in there . Like me.
---
Doubtfu ;_;
---
Yes. :(
---
Happened to me too, thought I was the only one (and it happens twice on the Scorched Earth event so that's even freaking worse!)
---
Can you use it to listen to people talking far away?
---
Lit
---
Irl it's +15% damage...to yourself!
---
&gt; The BETA has been over for almost 2 months.
---
ROFL
---
&gt;street cred
---
that's why you play the game lol
---
That's another direction I thought of too haha my buddy gave me a hardened sniper rifle and it's my best weapon right now. But how does it work with harder enemies and groups?
---
Bad bot
---
Perhaps I'll see you around in the wastes some time.
---
Yeah they have lost at least 40 bucks from me because I won't buy a PA skin for suits I don't wear. I mean it's bad enough I need to collect PA and they take 50 lbs of space in my stash but I'm definitely not going to spend real money on something I just won't use in game. 
---
I think the reason we don't have paint for the Excavator armor is because it's new and they haven't made whatever game programmer stuff they have to to make it work. 
---
Thank you so much! This will make a huge impact on the quality of gaming for me. Patches like this are the reason I bought the game even though I was warned about all the bugs. Keep up the good work!
---
Get a sentinel set homy. Thats my first pro tip
---
That or chemist cause I make distillate lol. But I felt green thumb was better
---
The first workshop you find you can drop a black titanium harvester. 
---
Not too bad. Limb dmg is good for are attacks. 
---
Not worth the perk cards or weight of 40mm ammo to me tho. Some builds might love it tho. 
---
Just found the plan tonight. It was in welch, near the weapon bench in the right part of the city, random plan drop location. Forgot i had it till i saw that post. Will craft it tomorrow maybe.
---
Whats going on with you people?  Are you playing the same game as me?  What economy?  Besides trading on discord and going to the scorcbeast queen, I don't see anyone ever lol.  Even if you are on the same platform as me, I can be near certain I'll never see you.  So what the heck is the big fuss about?  I just don't care if you have an auto double exploding super shot two kill mega nuke weapon.    I'm not saying I'm "against" it, I'm just saying, why do we care? lol  Okay you care for some reason, that's fine, I just don't care.  I see this post is 60% upvoted, so I'm guessing others don't care too xD  
---
In other news, ever nuked glowing enemy at whitespring is dropping a legendary 1 star weapon right now. 
---
Ok, here it is.
---

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Cool they're patching it so that the current player base will enjoy it more. Nothing they do is going to fix the issue that the majority of people have with Bethesda rn.
---
Yerp 
---
This game isn’t some holy future lmao,
---
they won’t ever do this again after the shit they got. They better stick to single player 
---
yes, exactly.  each chem overwrites currently active.
---
This is a HUGE TSE PVE buff. Most people who play this game PVE, since it's a PVE game. The PVP base is tiny, and it's a tacked on feature.
---
Same =.= 
---
Oh I love that one. God having to put down all Power armors to find the one your working on is a pain.
---
Dammit. I would think that the regular headlamp would just be the unmodded version. 
---
But emptying a quad means you've fired 20 shots... I'll test it tonight.
---
They've reduced the spawn of fusion cores in fusion generators in the world I think. They've increased the workshop fusion core manufacturing. I never had an issue with fusion cores either as it was always recharged when I logged in if I logged out wearing PA. I also had Power User so it reduced chassis weight I think. I never spent points in the fusion core perks and I hardly ever use PA any more anyway now except for Excavator for carry weight. I was just mentioning it as it's nice to get a heads up from PC earlier update to take advantage of things that might be changing while it lasts. I did the same when they reduced Whitespring mob XP in December. I ground out a bunch of levels before that update. When they make things give less XP and less loot I just lose motivation. Farming Whitespring is something I do if I need a few levels. Getting some legendary drops is nice. It's chill. It's casual. Nothing especially epic, but some nice 1 star items, a lot of crap. Maybe the rare 3 star item which is usually nothing special either. Nuked Whitespring is stressful for me. I don't like competing with people for mobs. I just see it playing out in my head. I go and solo the silo, and then people come and one shot stuff, and I don't need that frustration and anxiety. I just want to solo farm. So I hope they haven't nerfed this.
---
If you build it right. Your character needs to be really into sneak with your perks and all. You need all the riflemen perks, and a good rifle. You also need to get really good with your shot placement. But if you do, then you'll be killing anything you see in a single shot, regardless of their level.
---
In one shot? I dunno as I haven't witnessed it myself.
---
But other than that you can if you pelt them enough.  Normally people start doing it when they notice you are partway dead
---
It was good for those of us who haven’t duped a TSE handmade rifle and are still trying to kill shit with basic weapons or poorly rolled legendaries. 
---
Power armor pieces unequipping when getting into power armor is happening now for me at least. I didn't have this happen before 
---
perhaps, you play PC? 
---
So let the game be broken and add more content... You sound like the people begging mod authors to update.
---
But how much time does it take to dissapear? Cause I throw away a lot of materials or loot and would be nice to help others too ^^
---
YOU may be willing to accept and emphasize with these cheaters but I sure as hell don't have to. I hope they all get banned including those YouTubers and if I can somehow contribute to their downfall, count me in.
---
Misery loves company. Lets start a club! 
---
I got 10 harpoons the other day. I don’t use harpoons. 
---
Super curios if Tank Killer and Long Shot apply!
---
Even after following someone’s step by step instructions on how to translate the codes given into the actual codes, I still can’t figure out how THEY figured out that’s how it’s done. We searched all over the different terminals trying to find instructions that hinted at how the deciphering is done and couldn’t find anything. 
---
Sure its easy to think that when u neglect the things they actually fix and only focus on what is still (and maybe wasnt even promised to be fix by this patch) broken or what may have become broken (natural course of development unfortunately).
---
Tbh you were probably better off selling them anyway. I don’t roll with more than 40 at any given time and always sell my excess (I also keep some stashed for emergencies) but I rarely break them nowadays. 
---
Well you're really gonna want to take a look at those so try to get them to load
---
Play with friends, most potential amount of fun possible. Other than that, torment the females.
---
I’m level 79 and I killed a 150 and a 130 10 times this morning. They were killing me too but I was making more money lol. It’s fucked up but hilarious. 
---
I picked up a Tesla rifle plan from Phoenix the other night and I seem to be having a good time with it. Fair amount of damage and the arcing is actually really useful. But I hardcore do agree, energy weapons on a whole are hot garbage in the games current state. I can't speak for Gauss Rifles, but just about everything in that category is trash, which sucks because I absolutely adore energy weapons.
---
Good choice wearing excavator. You'll get twice the yield.
---
I have Speed Demon, I just figured it was because of that. But I have noticed my hunger and thirst drains much faster now. 
---
Level 45 Instigating Explosive Dragon :0
---
Why thank them? They don’t deserve it at all, they made the game what it should had released as. Stop enabling them. 
---
You're right and I agree. The fact Destiny 2 was better than their last FPS MMO is how it should be and Activation made sure their most current Online game was better than their last online games.
---
In that vein, Fallout 76 is the best Online Fallout Bethesda has ever made. The is no previous Online Fallout game that is better than Fallout 76.
---
I feel the same way. I used to have a lot more water saved. I think I take a lot more drugs now though…
---
No
---
Yeah it was a pretty cool little reference
---
Gatling plasma shreds scorchbeasts.  And you can get about 5 kills per 100% condition.
---
What the fuck are you even trying to say on the title? 
---
Lol someone doesnt play other mmos
---
That's nice, I use to tp to newcomers and put bags in the ground. But like this more. Do that loot on stash dissapear after some minutes if anyone takes it?
---
Now we just need a patch to punish the supers. Ban seems reasonable 
---
Sure do. Kalel777. I know. I know. Sad that I am so unoriginal that I use the same name, but I've never really aspired to be anything. Not even an art teacher from high school.
---
This power armor skin only has this single picture so far, no additional ingame screenshots either.
---
In the future i will try adding some additional pictures if they are available.
---
I can consider making ingame screenshots of the power armour myself as long as the textures are available. It would take some extra effort though, since i'd have to mod them in. Let me know if there is a lot of demand for this.
---
Explore &amp; do what is fun for you
---
thats an issue client side my friend. my game looks gorgeous, with the occasional, superlong Ghoul neck
---
so tru. found this out a few days ago and after a couple dozen  attempts of server hopping i got all the plans including chest
---
Indeed, as do I.
---
That sounds like a bug to me :)
---
Laser turret has better range one deals with most of the shooting baddies. 
---
That sounds cool as hell!...maybe not at the time.
---
Yes tank killer works with SMGs and i would assume long shot as well.
---
No idea, but ive seen things in other containers that dont normally show up in those types of containers, like weapons in medkits, etc. so it may persist for some time
---
its bugged? i thought i just could never find the damn place they wanted me to find
---
You sound like a very immature child
---
Glad your not responsible for the development of every mmo since all allow this.
---
Try interacting with other players? Like, c'mon, don't make me explain the concept of the game lol
---
I was just curious if it was me, that’s why I asked if anyone else is having the same problems
---
Yeah they got me too with that one. Also don’t buy the vault boy headlamp, it’s horrible 
---
happens to me all the time. people blame dupers for everything when it's clearly the servers that are just shit.
---
That isn't super surprising, but still disappointing when I hear it.
---
Same on xbox
---
Damn, nice. That solves the major drawback from Fallout 4!
---
Op post vid I need to hear the magic 
---
Im glad that the mindless farming at Whitesprings is gone... but now i'm bummed that there's only 1 good spot to drop nukes. F
---
I must be very lucky.  Just killed my first two tonight.  They were some crazy battles too.  got a few legendaries(nothing great) and a bunch of plans from both.  Ultracite armor plans, prime receivers, and the radiation shower.
---
They know already.
---
I chase them. 
---
mothman one looks kind of cool!
---
Exactly. For some reason there are some mods like that. Also, do not buy an auto grenade launcher “standard magazine.” You actually can’t even mod that gun’s magazine.
---
Still need to test my troubleshooters gamma gun. Wonder if it even does damage. 
---
Oh yeah especially when we mistaken a feature for a bug and then Bethesda changes something that makes our whole play style useless..I could have been very well benefitting the recharge bug but I never paid much attention. It's possible they kept recharging and I mistook that for them lasting for ages 
---
Would you happen to have a recommended build?
---
Which is fine, I guess my comment was more aimed at the title of the thread, very glass half empty
---
They intend to add player vending soon. If they don't fix it by then, you will know exactly what I'm talking about. As for my like ratio, I knew this would be controversial and it's actually more than I expected. Regardless, I stand by its purpose. Deleting dupes, if possible, would be a positive for the game. I've yet to hear an argument that convinced me otherwise.
---
Yours if you want it, Im on PC
---
it weighs like 6.3 tons jesus
---
Yes but you are not everyone and if they did do that, there would be a mass exodus of people who DONT follow FO76 reddit, who don’t follow fallout Twitter, who don’t keep up with this nonsense. Congrats, you just destroyed the fragile player base of the game.
---
I’ve met plenty of people with incredibly high quantities of things obtained not by duping. Hell I could bump to 1000 stims easily if I craft out all my blood packs and dilute and I don’t even farm hard. That number would have to be way higher to actually prove anything. 
---
Letting duping go on for another month to set a trap that no one that data mines the game notices seems like a terrible idea since a) another month is a lot items out in the market being bought with honest caps b) people aren’t as dumb as you’d like to pretend and that’d be incredibly easy to sniff out c) is really underestimating just how many players have done or do the glitch 
---
Like it or not this game is probably not popular enough to go on a harsh ban hammer run. The negative press on the game is already astounding and it’d just add more fuel to the fire. 
---
People in your group can build at your camp but they cannot destroy or remove anything.
---
I’m having a persistent crash to desktop issue whenever I get hit by or have any kind of collision with ghouls In cranberry bog and white spring.... help! 
---
I’ve tried running the game scan to fix the files, I’ve uninstalled and re downloaded the game, and I can’t seem to find a fix for this.
---
Literally every time a ghoul touches me, I CTD. I’ve lost countless items and hundreds of pounds of junk to this bug and I’m guessing I’m not the only one. 
---
I’m down. Will add you
---
My daughter and I run around in mothman cult regalia. May you be bathed in the glow of His love
---
I regret not getting the blackbird skin :(
---
If FO76 is the future, you may as well let the franchise die
---
Like seriously did you just say FO76 is he future of Fallout? Are you fucking insane or just dumb as fuck? 
---
World full 
---
For sure need spots that have several close together spawns. Everywhere else is technically farmable but two mobs and then several minutes between areas with decent spawns sucks 
---
I don't want to PVP, and the monster mash lot table is really good apparently. PVP events should give PVP loot like assassin's gear, just like other games.
---
Yea my "dupers" comment was just a shitty attempt at humor.  I have no clue if it actually affects it or not.
---
Im mainly just curious if the servers are acting up for anyone else on console as it's never been this bad for me and suddenly tonight I can't stay connected for more than around a half hour and the game having serious issues for everyone in the servers I was able to get responses
---
Not exactly. I'm not fully done with it yet. 
---
Just wander about and explore and have fun discovering the world. Much more fun than chasing quests. I just do quests as I come upon them organically and I’m having a blast!
---
Alrighty
---
I'm going to expand on the general "tell power armor frames apart" request.
---
Let's assume for the moment that displaying the full frame contents in inventory windows is a significant technical challenge for whatever reason.  Likewise renaming items.
---
One thing the engine appears to already support it putting icons after the names of items in the inventory screens.  Favorites get hearts, items from the Atom Shop (or with Atom Shop paint jobs) get an atom symbol or something, legendaries get stars, etc.  And items can have multiple little icons.
---
What if players could tag items with icons themselves?  Or at least tag power armor frames?  Not an unlimited number of icons, obviously; probably just one user-defined icon that can be selected from a set of predetermined, not-otherwise-used icons.
---
Ideally it would be set directly from the Pip-Boy interface, but crafting it as a free mod would also be reasonable.
---
It would take some UI work and art design, but it would let people distinguish their power armor by icon while possibly being simpler to implement than some of the other possibilities.
---
And all of these idiots want to thank them on top of the 60 dollars they had stolen. 
---
I had this happen to me too and it was the only time another player has killed me. Not really sure why I became wanted but 🤷🏽‍♀️ I was out on a road in the middle of nowhere. 
---
Same :) I think they should keep the regular servers too—a mix of PvE/PvP—but also have the option for separate and ONLY servers.
---
I’d rather have a speedo
---
Is that on nexus mods?
---
And how do bethesda treat mods in 76? Is it possible that there could be consequences from using one? 
---
Also console can only save 50 photos. 
---
Oh no. I can’t find your GT?!?!
---
This would be an absolutely great addition in my opinion.  It would give Power Armor more character and feel overall unique.
---
Same goes with Colonel Royez from Fallout New Vegas.  His Scorched Sierra Power Armor was awesome.  I believe the state animal for West Virginia is the Black Bear so it would make some sense to see it return.  The paint job was also nice.
---
Yea it's been horrendous tonight on Ps4 for me.  Never seen it this bad
---
I disagree and agree lol. There should NOT be more places like the club house because that’s not what the game is for. I agree however that it could be fixed and that higher levels can be annoying. With this update people won’t be able to count on the glowies because of their new xp and this will hopefully lead to people going elsewhere. 
---
Yea, the +explosive dmg doesn't appear to apply either but it may who knows
---
Bethesda has made a few uh
---
"Design Choices" that i just assumed were bugs because of how terrible they are like letting my x-o1 stealth field mod be turned into literal steel walls for my camp without telling me so wouldn't be supprised if they were afraid of PVP gamma gun stuff or people running around with a whole 5 Rifles on them.
---
Couldn't tell you, every server i joined hard locked with "server not responding" one of which caused me to lose all my junk.... this is disappointing to say the least.
---
I think they need to pass the flag and tools to modders now if this is the best they can do on a "stability patch" :/
---
I wonder if you were in the battle I just left fifteen minutes ago. I was the idiot running around in a hazmat suit with a heated power fist and like five different Gatling guns.
---
I haven't seen a single ultracite or high level recipe in spite of having two characters. :C 
---
Was wondering is you sold yet and if not I’ll pay 1k caps for the explosive
---
The ability to name them would be helpful
---
Why is this a good thing? Did I miss something?
---
BETHESDA PLEASE HELP!
---
I’m having a persistent crash to desktop issue whenever I get hit by or have any kind of collision with ghouls In cranberry bog and white spring.... help!
---
Literally every time a ghoul touches me, I CTD. I’ve lost countless items and hundreds of pounds of junk to this bug and I’m guessing I’m not the only one. Also, after the first CTD I’ll frequently just be dropped from servers and DC/d even though my connection and NAT settings allow for a seamless connection. 
---
Yeah, they came out today, and seems to be more or less complete, good job for basic minimum competency. That said? Having an idea of A) what's happening, and significantly more fucking important B) How large the fucking file is, ahead of time, is useful information it would cost them literally _nothing_ to provide the night before. 
---
I don't understand why you're getting downvoted. I put way too much time into farming when the game first launch and as a result I have thrown away or gifted about half a dozen explosive weapons because they weren't level 50 or they were on a weapon I didn't like to use. The only TSE guns I've kept are my assault rifle and shotgun. That brings the total to 8, which I feel is probably an average or slightly above average number. There are only so many modifiers you can get on a gun and once you get a feel for which events are worth doing you get quite a few legendaries in each session. 
---
Where exactly did you find those two placed?
---
They're everywhere and hard to break. The update isn't a game changer just a boon for us forgetting to drop the hundreds we've accumulated farming whitesprings 
---
Go to the train station in morgan town I think for the responders.. run I think north into the airport where you do the quest to resupply the caches and that old chick talks about people and needs and such, past the 2 tents into the shipping container with the weapons workbench and a dead responder, take the key off his body and open the safe next to him, each server hop you can get between 0-81(so far) bobby pins.
---
Even if you don't need em they sell for a cap a piece and it's free loot.
---
Fusion cores seem to be harder for me to find 
---
Holy hell. I thought I had a lot of recipes because I haven't found any new ones in awhile but I don't have Jack shit. 
---
I kind of laughed at the ballistic fiber thing. People have been saying ‘why do I need ballistic fiber to repair an armor that didn’t need it to craft?!’ And Bethesda’s response was ‘fine! Now you need it to craft the armor! Happy?!’
---
Nah. Would kill pvp entirely . It adds suspense to the game that at any moment someone could swoop in and rekt you and your house . 
---
I don't go out of my way to pvp, and have only fought like twice tops  but I'd hate it if was gone completely.  
---
You’re right, there isn’t much need for that many. Once or twice lately I’ve almost run out before having a chance to top up from my stash supply, but it’s very rare that I get close to using up the 10 that I left home with.
---
Me? Ok whatever you say I'm the immature child yet I'm not the one being like "im going to break your neck like a chicken bone" and don't forget the classic "I'mma track your IP" unless your talking about Tinkerbell in which case disregard. 
---
Have only seen rumors so far.  Im not sure what % the dense mod gives. 
---
didnt see stash size increase. Its still at 600
---
Same.. getting drills still. If there's like a dozen fighters they always kill the small 3 star legendaries before I knew they spawned .then I'm.left with the queen which I feel has the same spawn chance as any other enemy so you're just as likely to get nothing as you are a standard ghoul 
---
God..... God help us all.
---
nowhere, I placed them so I could take a look (not ingame, not into hacking or anything, plus I think the game has defenses against placing ATX items outside of approved cells)
---
Lol fake since those notes are found on a bunker during a quest 
---
10/10 would go to that joint 
---
To true. People here are praising Bethesda for making fixes that should be expected to already be in a game. They’re on the right track, but this should be expected by a huge company like Bethesda 
---
Yup, everything. 
---
Not surprised. Its actually pretty common(in my experience) for a patch to cause new/old issues, or for issues that were stated to be fixed, to not actually be fixed.
---
I’m speaking in general, not just Bethesda games.
---
I didnt understand why anyone got excited about the “150” bug fixes. I full expect that at least half of them wont actually be fixed or will cause new issues.
---
If thats real that is priceless and I love it defiantly would suck but tickles my giggle d***.
---
I’ve dropped 4 times without my typical reasons. I even loaded in to a disconnected world
---
Enough 
---
They may have fixed one way, who knows how may exploits there are
---
No. Most players do not follow fo76. They don’t follow fallout twitter. They don’t follow fallout specific social media... they would just log in and suddenly see the things they traded for/grinder for suddenly gone and would probably quit. FO76 is on thin ice as it is already...
---
There is also another part of armor called dense that nerfs it even more 
---
Haven't played since the update. After the first time they said they fixed it, I got a huge bump.in performance. Feel.like that went away as soon as other exploits were doing 
---
Energy weapons in general*
---
Since 1894!
---
Until we get proof the dupe bug is done, I'm holding my thanks
---
There is a strange bug that causes several bullets of my equipped weapon to be removed when i forrage berrys etc.. 
---
Would be nice to see this fixed too!
---
I came to this sub to make this exact post. With all the [very] necessary patches ... throw some new songs in. My absolutely zero knowledge of programming leads me to believe it wouldn’t be a huge ordeal. 
---
504
---
Got arms for robot somewhere, but still missing chest and legs.  Got all the light trapper, but no heavy or sturdy (if those exist).
---
I noticed that. Forgot. Only my helmet however. Anytime I get it I need to equip my helmet too. 
---
I don't really need the xp from the crafting at this point, but I just go through Fort Defiance and collect straight jackets. They're worth 200 each and you usually get I think 17 total, if you get them all. 😊
---
Usually is there until someone takes it or the server crashes.
---
What is that even like? I don't have luck in real life so I guess it's going somewhere. 
---
Fallout 4 had the plasma flamer which could also get bleeding legendary effect if you lucked out. It was a very evil weapon.
---
99% sure it is, it looks exactly like the "G" in Garrahan in the top left
---
Have you thought about taking off thru hiker and using Evasive to increase your dam Res? I have been toying with my melee build and i dont understand how you have 500+ damage. I have a similar build to yours but i have a 20 str because of my Enclave Under armor and 2 leg pieces with a +1 STR each. 
---
working as intended
---
Haven’t seen a hard lock yet. Just long load times. Not really lag however. 
---
And you are not everyone. In fact, most of you here are nowhere close to the average player. The average player doesn’t follow FO76 social media. They don’t follow any of this nonsense. They would just see that they grind the shit to get their new gun and suddenly it is gone. With all the other nonsense surrounding Fallout, people WILL quit.
---
there’s nothing wrong with that, as long as u have something, you’re never going nowhere. ill add you next time i’m on? keep a look out for luficr. or add me on discord? luficr#5883
---
I mean, I get that you care.  I'm in the camp that thinks it's not possible, especially at the rate they are able to keep up with fixes and they just barely stopped the duping to begin with.  I don't think they have any sort of logging to see who traded with who or what is said in voice chat or any of that.   SO I think the 30+ posts a day about deleting duped items is more annoying than anything else lol.  That said, I still don't really see the problem as so great.  This isn't the kind of game where I'm going to get kicked out of a scorchbeast group because I don't have the right equipment.  I'm going to show up and do as I damn well please anyway.  It's a sandbox game.  I'm like level 120+ now and I'm just wandering around by myself looking for some T-51b armor to apply my new hotrod skin to and there isn't a single TSE shotgun wielding character to be seen in the last 3 hours xD   Literally only at queen and whitesprings maybe do I see other players regularly.  
---
TLDR:  I don't think its possible personally,  I don't think its as big a deal as we are making it out to be, and I never see other players around except one or two hotspots.
---
I don’t have everything but I do have all turrets. I just feel they should track and shoot better. I’ve set them up so it should be really hard for anything to approach my camp. 
---
This is just lag, the game is catching up with what you just did. Nothing is actually removed, its been around since the beta. 
---
Begun, the clone war has. 
---
Ive got a set of x01 for sale with all best stuff jetpack optimized breacers calibrated shocks bright lamp and targeting hud for 5000 think of the time i could have saved you
---
Are you sure it was the overseer's stash (brown/tan stash)? The one at the overseer's camp only holds 20 weight max. Not sure if this is true for all of them.
---
Any chance it was your own stash (blue stashes)? 
---
15,000 atoms for an egg poster
---
I’ve done my waiting, 125 years of it!!!
---
Thanks for the feedback! I’ll get to wandering!
---
The stims were a throwaway idea, you can’t/won’t grind 1000 bobble heads just to make point, right?
---
Not that we don't trust ya, just us hoarder players are a bit skeptical about handing over everything I guess lmao
---
Bethesda: “We’re gonna ban all dupers....”
---
Community: “Hooray”
---
Bethesda: “And remove all duplicated guns and items from peoples inventories”
---
Community: “Now wait a second”
---
I feel like the lucky seed thing is accurate. The one I found the radium rifle in had two 3* melee drops and my friend found a Tse shotgun in the same lobby. That was from farming ghouls. If it helps I try to lower their health to half, let it refill, I check them by using the transfer button because maybe one out of my five or six were from just pulling the weapon and checking it in the pip boy. I've also started to stay away from whitesprings. Not saying that's a bad farm. I found 3 their so there has to be something to it. It really does fall on rng i or good seed I suppose. 
---
Pretty common issue many are complaining about, especially on the official forums.
---
If your not a PC user you don't have the patch yet.
---
Well, it's been most of the day already and no new methods of duping have popped up. Looks like it might be gone for good. But unfortunately, it doesn't seem like bethesda is going to do anything to punish those who did it, so sadly you guys on consoles might have to just deal with the unbearable servers until you get the patch. Having 12 identical tse rifles isn't enough yet, they need to get 600 before the patch drops
---
Do you have strength-increasing legendaries or deep-pocketed armor? They don't work in power armor so your base could be higher than what PA gives. 
---
A real gourmand.... really appreciate the amount of time and research went into this. Thank you!
---
I would love this. 
---
I'm getting more frequent crashes to desktop today, seemingly random (one while selling to the harper's ferry vendor, after about 5 minutes in-game, and the next maybe 15 minutes later at the end of a scorchedbeast queen fight).
---
I'll keep a lookout. I don't actually use Discord. I know. I know. I... wait I already used that joke... 😆
---
Does anyone know if plans for weapons (ie Handmade) are now available at upper levels? I know there was a (no doubt accidental) upper limit to a heap of weapons plans...
---
But yes, a huge list of fixes and for that I am thankful!
---
It had a touch of multiplayer that was actually pretty decent, afaik it hasn't been dropped, but isn't exactly regularly updated. 
---
Personally I've noticed that quite a large part of the group that would be so-called "isolationists" in this analogy, clinging to the past, are actually not clinging to the actual past, but the *middle* in the history of Fallout; **New Vegas**, which isn't actually the original Fallout, at all. Furthermore, a lot of those people who see New Vegas as being the "true Fallout" actually started *with* New Vegas, and *then* went and played Fallout and Fallout 2, and, there's something to be said about an experience being colored by your earlier experiences.
---
Then there are quite a lot of those of us, who played Fallout back in 1997, and to whom *each* new iteration, starting with Fallout 2 and including every single game since, has been a step away from what Fallout originally was. Yes, *even* Fallout 2 changed the original Fallout. However, those steps are expected and not at all necessarily a bad thing. Each game has been a new take on the world.
---
It's a little bit like certain fans of a band hating on that band when it comes to the newer albums, and pining for new albums that are exactly the same as the original ones. Or, in this analogy, an album from the middle of the career of that band.
---
I mainly use it for farming legendary items as I’m nearly level 80 and still using basic weapons, which means things like scorchbeasts take a good 10-20 minutes to knock down. Don’t get me started on the queen. I usually just tag her and wait for the TSE crew to bring her down (hoping the server doesn’t disconnect when she’s below 1/4 HP). 
---
I disagree that that’s not what the game is for. It is a looter-shooter in essence, due to the somewhat watered down nature of the rpg elements, so before we have any real end-game content, this is the best we’ll get so expanding on it and improving it seems like a good idea in my books. 
---
Yes.
---
That effect also triggers the Team Medic perk as well, interestingly enough.
---
nothing beats an evening of 76 after a long day of classes..
---
Have you even tested this yet... Tse shotgun still one taps you fool. L2test. 
---
Toon predates wow though afaik
---
Damn, that sucks dude.  And that maybe.  It was on ps4, and I did see a guy running around in a spacesuit with a gatlin gun, lol.  I was in X01 American skin armor using a combat shotty and explosive revolver.
---
omg, haha well i will probably be on later tonight :) i’ll fosho add ya
---
Nah we say that but we just say dont cheat xD thats a service thats avalaible thats all. We all have everything anyway lol
---
My chest-piece is +1 strength but other than that no. 
---
Well sort of alone in the frequency at which you're receiving performance issues, I am finding many more lock up/freezes than I normally did, several times now the game just halts, then continues right before I take action like it's purposely fuckin with me. Also load screens now are quite comical, as the UI thinks it's done, but it's not, so I get to see the last 40-60% of the world load in and build itself which is interesting in and of itself but I'd prefer my in game selfies.
---
It costs less to repair, which is better. I think a bigger up front cost once off is better than it costing a lot of ballistic fiber every time to repair it. 
---
&gt; It adds suspense to the game that at any moment someone could swoop in and rekt you and your house .
---
And how would that go away on a pvp server?
---
If anything, it should increase it.
---
I agree with your perspective to an extent. I will not play Fallout 76 ever again. I don't think it is a good game, nor do I believe it could become a good game unless you rebuilt 90% of it from the ground up... and no company does that. I believe that the idea of Fallout 76 was destined for failure as it merely took Fallout 4, ripped out and threw away the best parts. They then made it a multiplayer game that lacks the elements that make Fallout so loved by its fanbase. That being said there is no point for continual complaining about it. For those of us who dislike it, we can speak with our wallets as that is the only language that will get through to the major stockholders in the company. For those of you who do like it, enjoy.
---
You have to realize how little I care that you don't believe me.. 
---
Pointing towards the fair grounds?
---
Thanks!  I knew I was missing the Chilins recipe and had forgotten I had read about the Owlet Nuggets, but for that one I was wondering if it was even in game.  It's called "Owlet" and if that refers to an in game owl we don't have those.  I saw it on another site that said they scraped game files to get their list so I wasn't sure if it was real.  I didn't know about the Cramburger.  And, I've killed a few megasloths, but not gotten a mushroom.  Do you need to be doing an event to get it?
---
I went into Uncanny Caverns several times as well as Lucky Hole a bunch of times and there's one in Cranberry Bog that I tried today.
---
Yes, I made the Iguana Soup and I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be called Squirrel Soup lol.
---
I don't know where I got those last two, but I know Mud Cookies was one of the more recent ones I found and my last 4 came from Cranberry Bog on the northwestern to central northern area.  Check all the military camps, the farm and the moonshiner's shack.  Granny's Tea came from Max's Farm.
---
Somebody else mentioned the golf course for ginseng and I did remember seeing it there after that.  I'll get the exact location tomorrow and update what I posted.
---
I’m hoping the Gauss wasn’t previously affected by rifleman, because that means I’ll be bringing mine out of retirement. Might make it viable again. 
---
You get some of the highest damage output and armor penetration, the weight is a trade off. I doubt they'll change that. 
---
You'll have to make your own friends
---
Lol for not caring you seem pretty upset
---
How? 
---
People haven’t realize this is a “service game” and Bethesda planning forthe playerbase to play it for years to come  with updates and dlc 
---
Yes, I know. I still don't believe it. They are just lazy.
---
I'm going to need a better argument than 
---
\&gt; about like 2 or 3 clips  
---
DO SOME SCIENCE, MAN.
---
Party Girl and Lead Belly for sure
---
Yeh never seen it drop either apart from the quest item u mention.
---
Let me say it again. That's -2 
---
I guess i should have paid more attention thank u!
---
But that requires going outside into the sunlight and fresh air. Impossible.
---
This is no secret. Why only pm?
---
You just need five pieces of sentinel and Assasin modifier
---
That way 40% reduction from player and
---
75% damage reduction while standing and not moving. Be careful staggering though. 
---
After the patch you can also slot the “fire protection” perk card for further explosive damage reduction and also there is a mod for the armor that can reduce explosive damage also. 
---
Dude it does wierd things to everything around it lol https://youtu.be/yJpXGnJbSD0
---
Is there a mod to get 3 lights? Or is this another lie?
---
Have you played Fallout games before? I recommend playing how you play those: explore everything! Enjoy the storytelling Bethesda excels at through world design. Read every terminal and note, pick up and listen to every holotape. Pick up weapons and armor and scrap the extras to learn new mods to make yours better! Do events and dailies and challenges in addition to the main quests. 
---
Join up with other players - it’s really fun to team up! It can be great to step away and play solo at times too, just so you don’t miss things. There’s a lot of variety. :) Just try a bit of everything!
---
Bulk acid already gives 15, it inadvertently gave more than what it used to make. That's the reason for the fix, people were bulking acid and breaking it down to farm acid.

You’re mad someone on the internet didn’t believe you
---
Where’s Gary? And did that vault dweller ever find his son?
---
You were in a server where there are something like 10 guys in power armor and TSE gatling guns? And someone just loop launched nukes for Queens? If Yes my drops sucked too but my question is how can they organize that way. I want to farm SBQ that way too!
---
I got 3 levels last night not even going for the full nuke time. Gonna miss that. I think I was getting 1100ish xp per glowing ghoul with xp buffs on and inspirational maxxed out
---
Cool. I really have to get to sleep. Gym by 4:30 am and all that... 😭 c u around.
---
They could make each legendary a “unique” item that will only allow one in your inventory at a time. That will take care of the weapons and armour... the items will be a bit more difficult. But you could just make a tool that scans for anyone that has absurd amounts of any item and then removes 85-90% of them from their inventory.
---
I think I can make a 50cal receiver for you. Free of charge if you have the supplies. Should be on tomorrow night.
---
I meant in the game. Ain't nobody got time for that going outside shit 
---
Exactly,  especially since people now see they can make real money from this
---
This. It basically has mind control, but it works on everything.
---
Thanks. Yeah I'm currently getting Armorer 2 and 3 to apply it to my Heavy BoS Combat Armor chest.
---
I think maybe it was cards such as the tank killer perk? 
---
Yes. 
---
Bad management, not bad devs. I can tell you that if the devs had any control over it, they would have held back release. They are just as aware of all the bugs and issues the game has as anybody else is, and they actually care about the games they make. Management on the other hand, is what only cares about money.
---
When it comes to game development you cant think of a company, especially a AAA studio of a single, shared mind. Management makes the decisions on the games and the devs try to make it the best they can. The developers are the ones who care about the community, and their fanbase, and what they make. Unfortunately, it's such a competitive industry so the thought of quitting a company to make a statement is daunting.
---
The weapons over lvl will be dupe free and not tainted by the super DUPERS
---
Just think it's strange that every single weapon category has a perk that reduces weight except for the rifles
---
The issue however is a rather large amount of deaths don't give you the bleed out call for help option, making the life saving affix or "mysterious savior" perk not do nothing.
---
Can we say this for guns as well? 700 atoms for **1 gun???**
---
Because than its only pvpers and you are expecting to be attacked, and it would be far more common running intk ppl geared specifically for it . As opposed to more random chance encounters while you are roaming.  It would ruin the feeling of the game.
---
For real. This game was like a slap in the face on release. It still doesn’t entertain me at all. I’m glad they’re fixing it but I mean, it’s their job. 
---
[PS4][Shaggy009] Is anyone else having issies wkth VATS and twoshot? I am nkt able to hit any 95% shot with my handmade.
---
That's what I'm talking about. But how do I make friends when my dog ate my mic?
---
Okey dokie bud. I'm not going to have 60 comments back and forth about dumb shit from someone equally as ignorant. I'm reporting you for selling elder paint and you better hope you don't have a comment with your ign. 
---
Not to be pedantic but that is easy to replace.  If it was a 3* armor chest piece though...
---
Yes definitely. Having an option would be nice
---
That's fine for when we're out and about and want to check, but we still need some indicator at the vendors.
---
PvP only servers will devolve into a deathmatch with zero point doing anything else. 
---
There needs to be a balanced mix somehow. The people shouting "NO PVP!" need to be accomodated for, but also need to realise that PvP exists and also needs catered for.
---
Not sure what they can do to pacify the snowflakes without making them fodder for PvP predators.. Im somewhere in the middle. I like co-op PVE but I want the added threat of other players... so perhaps a faction based PvP is really my only hope for this game (personally)
---
Having all of them except empath is pretty fucking sweet imo
---
Pretty sure you put those there lol but good try
---
Idk how but somehow I got one shot from “slap damage” in power armor, with 400 hp some perks or something are broken af 
---
When player vendors hit dupers will be unloading all their inventory for whatever they can get. Serums, 3* legendaries, 1,000 stackable bobbleheads, every plan in the game, all available to anybody with few caps. These profiteers will be richer than ever, selling cash for real money on eBay by the boat load. All your legit effort will be eclipsed by a flood of ill gotten gains, duper and consumer alike. Even more so than it is now. You might not care but plenty do, 60% right?
---
Yes. Mutations are end game buffs.
---
ah, well i bid you goodnight then. hopefully i catch you on tomorrow :) 
---
SBQ is supposed to be like a 'raid boss', and like I said, across the board damages need to be fixed, as it seems the only 'factor' for damage that mattered when things were originally balanced was 'over all damage per second'.  Also: perfect storm sets things on fire, it doesn't gib a small horde every few shots, it actually eats alot of ammo, rather quickly.  TSE however can be glitched out with the right steps to let one instakill the SBQ denying every one else the ability to loot her or contribute to the fight
---
Is that how slap damage works? A flat 90% damage reduction? I thought it was even more reduction then that tbh 
---
Seems like something that someone would do who is mad. You can do what you want but you apparently can’t stop yourself from getting mad at someone on the internet not believing your lies lol
---
Yeah more people need to realise this. The anti-PvP players want a nice peaceful Appalachia when in reality there are no threats once you max out your levels etc. This is where other players come in, or should come in.
---
It needs something.
---
It says "an issue" so I think there was something in the game that could have triggered the cards not working. Probably only affected a small number of people 
---
I have them all. With class freak. No regrets. 
---
Why are you carrying 1k weight of things?  Do you have alot of food/drink or what, cause honestly I find Thru Hiker better than Travelling Pharmacy for that reason
---
Log in. 
---
Something isn't right. 
---
Chest pa armor missing
---
Freak out. 
---
Found in inventory. 
---
Reequipping
---
F9 is my recommendation Baconwich...
---
You are not alone. I used to get a lag when entering the whitesprings and be teleported back to the door. Now the games seems to load all areas faster, but the more assets in the area the more I lag teleport. All of a sudden I am facing a different direction. 
---
Also the servers seemed ok right after the patch, but after playing all day I am up to 3-5 disconnects an hour and about to quit.
---
Guessing it's the basic 50% of an anti-armor legendary?
---
Agreed. If I could get rid of just one, that would be the one.
---
Also military grade duct tape scraps for adhesive and ballistic fiber
---
Platform?
---
No idea what he used but I was one shot with slap damage while in power armor with about 400 hp a few days ago, no idea what he used but it didn’t even seem to be explosive. And it literally was one hit I was dead before I even knew I was shot at 
---
It has been tested earlier today. Check the search bar
---
If someone buys a TSE shotgun, they should know it’s duped and should be punished accordingly. 
---
Thanks.
---
Booted 30 seconds after joining server but my bobby pins weigh nothing
---
Ive never duped, btw. Still dont rly know how.
---
You are a troll. And a bad one at that.  Good job selling stuff not even in the game yet. Prove it that I'm lying? I'm sorry you dupe items, you buy duped items, you have piss poor rng and you are trash. See how well you do now that they've patched duping. Have fun buddy. 
---
I did couldn't find actual results.
---
The mic probably still works. Just plug in the dogs tail and talk into its mouth.
---
Alrigjt I'll try to find the post 
---
What are you talking about, this makes them even better for PVE - something most players do.
---
Expect spiking prices, especially with no more duping.
---
Whoops, learn something new every day.

Also holy fuck get a life. All you do is play fallout.. Wtf is wrong with you buddy? Not getting laid enough? 
---
I have pictures, will upload them in about an hour. Was hundreds of Lbs, proof. And was Overseer's stash for sure.
---
They count as energy weapon ammo, even 1 rank in the relevant perk saves 0.8 wt per core

As long as they keep listening and following what they said they would do.

Logged in tonight and crashed at a vendor within a minute.  Relogged and tried a Bots On Parade event and crashed with 5 seconds left on the timer.
---
I think I'm going to reinstall the game in case there is a corrupt file but I'm not very impressed given that stability was a specific part of the patch notes.
---
NEVER MIND I’LL FIND...
---
*pans to audience of vault boys*
---
I always seem to have a surplus in stimpaks, lol, though the Pharmacist one could be useful for blast zones. I do have scrapper, though I wish they had made that one give more of the difficult to get materials like it did in previous games.
---
Amazing, time to respec a little lol. 
---
decide or settle on (a specific price, date, course of action, etc.).
---
I've done the exact same thing right next to my door lol, only it's level 3 locked... I live up on a cliff right next to Solomon's Pond and close enough to the Whitesprings, so I don't suppose a whole lot of people besides the higher levels would actually find my base.
---
Well, with maxed class freak and a teammate with empath, you both come out ahead. Never mind the Strange with Numbers bonus.
---
I think most people would be upset at losing their items they bought with caps. However I also think most people in this sub would support removing the dupes. 
---
Lol. K
---
What is your Bethesda/fallout76 username?
---
Indirectly buffed. Most people PVE.
---
Melee could prob do it with thier 3x sneak attack. It takes time to build it up but some builds can 2 shot the SBQ
---
Who's getting banned? 
---
... plus one upvote if that pun at the end was on purpose.
---
I don't know if it works but try using the spotlight. I heard it helps with getting them to track and fire better.
---
IF YOU HAVE MORE THEN A FEW COPIES OF A GUN OR ARMOR UR AUTO BANNED
---
Bro settle the fuck down on the caps and explain yourself?.
---
Imo energy and plasma weapons should deal higher dps than ballistics, since most ballistic weapons can be silenced to take advantage of sneak criticals.
---
Sneaky snipers vs raw firepower. 
---
Are you aware your Caps Lock was on? 
---
Weird flex but okay
---
WHY ARE YOU YELLING!
---
Same

I’m seeing people asking for duped items to be deleted, but how could Bethesda reliably go about this without fucking over legitimate players? I mean, some cases it’ll be obvious, where somebody has 25,000 TSE weapons or something, but in other cases, it becomes more vague, more complicated. 
---
The easiest solution would be to just wipe all of the servers and force everyone back to zero, but, again, I’m not sure how severe the consequences (as far as PR and player base goes) would be.
---
so I was browsing hentai sites looking for material when I hear it "one more thing" I fall out of my officially licensed DXRacer Chair knocking over my nachos and mountain dew spilling it all down my chins and shirt and onto my kill la kill body pillow "one more thing" I gasp for air not knowing when it will come I hold onto the my sticky waifu pillow"one more thing" I scream but its drowned out "one more thing" it now seems like its coming from all directions "one more thing" the lights flicker and dim to near black "one more thing"  I can feel its eyes staring at me "one more thing" I attempt to cover my face with my fedora but it doesn't fit "one more thing" the lights cut out "one more thing" I try to get up but I cant stand up on my own "one more thing" I start to cry this is the end of me "ONE MORE THING" I accept it the end "

Although wow has just two factions so you could very easily just get to a friendly or neutral town and wait the 5 minutes in safety so it’s still pretty easy to unflag safely after griefing 
---
That sound a little too over powered.
---
Don't exploit game bugs, don't get banned? Hm, seems simple really. Let us know how that refund goes for you.
---
Oh great, the caps lock bug has not been fixed.
---
Well, IF that is true it's  a good thing. Dupers are trash and should be banned
---
I've seen 1 cap = 1% charge as a common trade
---
I have not not heard of any bans from Bethesda. But if they are banning dupers bloody good on them. Fuck dupers you lads are scum of the earth and don't deserve this amazing game.
---
I'M NOT YELLING!
---
[guy on the couch](https://youtu.be/65vTMIMWaL8) 
---
Haha really? What happens if you're crafting guns to scrap? Do you get insta banned for that too? 
---
That’s impressive only because I haven’t seen an energy weapon cause any real damage. 
---
It was never gone :/ 
---
Lol damn man why’re you so insecure about getting called out over a lie on the internet? Get over it. At this point you’re trolling yourself with how upset you’re getting over your own lie. Also you’re terrible at making assumptions. Do yourself a favor and come back from fantasy land instead of making up things so you feel better about yourself. 
---
Yeah, I was agreeing, a pvp server still sounds like a terrific idea.
---
Another player on the Fallout Discord mentioned the possibility of just deleting all TSE code from the game and re-adding it. Idk anything about code but it could be a solution. Problem is TSEs are far from the only things duped.
---
The fact that they scan your PC is totally inappropriate. 
---
Thanks a lot dude - just laughed and spat coffee all over my desk and keyboard :D
---
Source? 
---
Some can be loyal like a pet dog. But if you attempt to control them, mistreat them in any way, then they will bite, and you won't like it. I personally am very gentle and kind. But I can be vicious if anyone crosses me.
---
It would be interesting to see how player tactics/BASE builds evolve in a pvp  only severs. Obviously in order to pull off pvp only serves and have them actually work properly they would have to implement some sort of match making to keep things interesting and not have low levels being mauled by level 100’s
---
The game felt unplayable almost until I got that perk. Of course, I'm a non-PA guy because I'm not a wuss.
---
I wish I had the atoms to get it at the time the Blackbird was out, I had around 1650 - 1700 and it honestly is the rarest PA paint in the game, more likely than not
---
Like honestly how can any piece of shit duper defend themselves from a ban?.
---
Source? I haven't heard anything yet
---
If someone role plays as a raider and enjoys it fine good for them, still means we should respond appropriately by banding together and hunting them down like we would a real raider/serial killer or whatever 
---
Exactly no chance of that happening unfortunately. Just gonna have to find a mod for it
---
Uh
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
CAPS LOCK ENGAGE!
---
Also, get fukked dupers
---
Next shows in 20mins ladies!
---
Same thing has been happening to me 
---
Isolate a small and select server cluster.  Make other servers and new servers.  Offer people the option to transfer to the new cluster but they would either restart or lost all items and start at vault 76.  
---
If duping is fixed, the dupers aren't going to give up their 92,000 TSE Handmades and whatnot, and will stay with the stubborn and other dupers on the old cluster.  
---
Losing my two shot, bashing, feather-weight pipe bolt action would be worth it to be able to trust trading with others again.
---
Doesn't seem very core to the game.  If they wanted it to be core, it wouldn't be slap damage.  It's just a half-assed tweener system to keep the people who want to kill confused enough to buy the game, yet not scare away the ~95% of the population that doesn't want it.
---
From my experience, no one actually wants a real fight in 76.  It's inevitably when I'm alone someone 100+ levels higher than me will appear with a friend or two because they're too afraid to go alone.
---
I've played and enjoyed plenty of core PvP games in the past.  This game isn't one of them.  If you're playing this for core PvP, I don't know how you haven't realized you aren't getting it yet.
---
HIS CAPS LOCK IS THE ONLY SOURCE YOU NEED
---
REEEEEEEE!
---
I wonder how many of Todd's millions have quit 🤣
---
Phoenix in watoga may sell it if you are lucky, of if you are on ps4 i can craft you one
---
I'm getting frank horrigan "time to die" vibes lol
---
Makes sense. Fuck Bethesda for banning people who exploited the game and made it ridiculously simple &amp; easy for themselves. Shame on you, Bethesda. 
---
I just started having an issue tonight where placing objects in my CAMP is glitched.  I was starting a new location for my CAMP and moving some objects around when the game kind of froze and did not respond.  I tried a combination of buttons to get a response.  Eventually it responded, but ever since then crafting has been glitched.
---
When I go to place any object, it stays stuck in one elevation and I am not able to change it.  For example, I want to place my stash box on the ground, but it defaults to about 10 feet in the air and no amount of looking up/down/around changes the position.  Every other object is at this height as well when I go to place as a new crafted object or a stored object.  I tried every button and combination of buttons I could think of on the controller, but it doesn't help.
---
I also tried restarting my xbox and re-deploying my camp.  Still no luck.  Hopefully this works itself out by the time I try tomorrow.  Very weird, but also very frustrating if I can no longer place objects in my CAMP.  It's clunky enough trying to build with a controller, much less a bugged crafting system.  Going to make it very difficult to plant crops or put down floors if I cant place things lower than 10 feet up.
---
Just killed her. Wasn’t my nuke, but I joined the group. About 10ish players, mostly 50+. Downed her in maybe 15 minutes. I was using a zealot’s 50cal I’d just found (am full heavy weapon spec) and hadn’t even upgraded yet; also just got Adrenal Reaction early so my damage was a lot more than I’m used to. 
---
I kept pulling aggro on the queen, most other players were rocking some form of explosive weapons; either Aggro is totally random, or her explosive resistance is so high my Zealot damage was more than their TSE.
---
I don’t understand how, I’m melee and have what I thought was a good weapon and there’s barely any more damage perks I could get yet somehow people still have melee weapons with like 2k and I’m lucky to get up to 500 damage 
---
as the god emperor said, fake news
---
I know right.   Remember NV?   At least it was worth the restart.  
---
I dump stuff in overseers cache boxes all the time, it’s the best way to help struggling new players and keeps my cache at a manageable level.
---
https://i.imgur.com/uN7oGcs.png
---
I don’t know. They killed it before it was even done. Definitely not entirely online though. 
---
You only hear about it from sensitive beings that moan about it on reddit. Same as all other things, you dont see any reddit posts about "Hey, sorry for repost, but no-one griefed me today WTF". You only hear the negative falsely exaggerating its occurrence.
---
I'll play the game again when the launcher can run more than 40 fps
---
As a console player for FO76, I'd be happy if they simply added a counting numeral at the end for each new chassis you collect etc. E.g. Power Chassis 1, Power Chassis 2, Power Chassis 3, etc. Seems simple enough and it'd be easy for me to remember which chassis is which based on the number. 
---
u/bethesdagamestudios_ are you ever going to fix the scopes of guns (red dot scope types) that don't display when using cloaking or stealth boy PA torsos? I hate guessing where I'm aiming 
---
Okey dokie buddy. You are the one that had to dig through my stuff to blackmail someone you will never meet in their life over an argument that I had that you were never a part of with someone equally as dense as you. Okey dokie buddy. I have to go to bed and get up for work in the morning like an actual adult. 
---
Yall are like victims of abuse with a little Stockholm thrown in.
---
Gota get that prewar money.
---
I think the are a few around white springs
---
Super funny to run into you in-game so soon after you responded to my post.  Happy hunting out there and good luck with the lag.
---
got to a point where i lack only empath and twisted muscles, and now i'll just buy a twisted serum and i'll be complete
---
Don't understand :\
---
Anyone here want a free mutuation? Ive got marcupial and chameleon, crafted a good few and will give some away free. New to the whole reddit thing so either reply here or add my ps4 name gregmcd25 and dm me there saying who you are 👍
---
Just accept your new title as Raider King xXsnip3rassa$$in420shadowXx
---
and generators seemingly work without them
---
This game could have been excellent.  
---
I simply extract new data from the atom store, so its entirely possible that the item data/textures for some of them was already in the client.
---
 Literally made a reddit account to give my 2 cents because the Ultracite gatling laser is my white whale right now and I also would at least like to be hinted the right way for the Plans. Im on xbox (if that matters) and in my 268 levels in the game I have only come across 2 of the guns. First time from a level 80 scorchbeast and oddly enough the second time was today off of a level 50 scorch beast. I have killed ALOT of normal scorchbeasts so much so that I believe i have every prime receiver in the game since killing the queen I dont get prime plans anymore. Ive probably killed the Queen less than 20 times and have received alot of primes from just killing the normal 50,65 and 80 scorchbeasts. With all that said the one result i get from google leading to gamepedia saying alot of event quests in the cranberry bog can give the plans but Ive been doing most of these events with no success. Ive been looking for at least 3 weeks for the plans so if anyone who can create the gun please inform us how you got it. 
---
"omggggg!!! I got banned for that sweet 4-shot-explosive-radioactive-selfrepairing-totally-legal-shotgun billy gave me! mom!!!"
---
At this point you cant issue bans because of trading. Alot of players who bought duped items could be caught in the crossfire from just possessing a duped weapon even if they dont know it was duped. At this point the exploits should be patched as the come in but the damage thats been dome cant be fixed. And i also doubt that bethesda would allocate the time and resources into tracing back all these items to the original dupers. 
---
100% confirmed guys, dupers drop your invo quick 
---
I would like to see that too!
---
If a fusion core is at 53% charge, it sells for 53 caps. A fully charged fusion core would be 100 caps
---
Save game. Kill everyone. Drag their corpses and build a pile of bodies. Why am I doing this. I don't know.
---
I wish we had better NPCs or even robot communities that you could attack as raiders. Then others could get a notification for defending them or rebuilding after an attack. 
---
Idk, like watoga but with civilian bots or a super mutant communities. I just don't like to go after individuals for just a little of scrap. Would be nice if you had to choose a faction and have events directing you towards specific raids. 
---
How many of Todd's millions? 🤣
---
Their*
---
This is an  ignorant comment. Even though it didnt sell as fallout 4 doesnt mean hardly anyone plays it. All three platforms still have sizable player bases 
---
Some of them are easy to pass over depending on your play style, some are pretty much must have for everyone, such as speed demon and marsupial 
---
&gt; I can tell you that if the devs had any control over it, they would have held back release.
---
Source?
---
very lol
---
Yeah thats what I meant, the models/textures/materials have been in there from the beginning, some had asset data to go with it (Ornate didnt altho I thought it did). But most likely didnt have the atom store bindings, which they do now
---
... and he couldn't just fast travel to your camp again?
---
I know how you feel! I avoid significantly higher level players now because of a similar experience.
---
Grab your self carnivore first, then go ham
---
What a shitty thing to do, he must think you're a turd and got pretty pissed. 
---
I sold 100+ before the patch as well. It’s probably for the best. 
---
I agree, Fallout core fans have alot of really narrow minded anti-social players who absolutely hated the fact that this is Fallout 4 lite with multiplayer, instead of being a Single player Fallout 5 game made by Obsidian in the original retro tactic style RPG gameplay.
---
Entitlement: the post.
---
HOW DARE YOU BAN ME FOR CHEATING IN AN ONLINE GAME?!?!?
---
It’s funny seen u talking about weapons, weapons and weapons... what about caps ? What about the millions of caps that ware fabricated, making it now worthless. Let’s say  the dups are removed (and no other dups are found): When new people start to play are thy expected to farm 30k (overpriced) caps to buy non dup weapons ? (with 1.4k caps a day). We all know how hard is to came by naturally to the good weapons. I don’t have a single idea how much I need to farm to get what I want it the game....
---
My suggestion to fix the economy is to create a new tear of weapons : from lvl 50 - 65. This would make the current less valuable.  This would lead to an increase in the mob lvl cap. To fix the caps: they should implement a system of a special currency earned by doing “daily” events  and not tradable. With that currency u could purchase the top tier weapons. This would make the best weapons accessible as long as u play. Then people would not have to go outside of the game and buy weapons if they don’t want to.  They would know how much time it’s required to play to get what they want. 
---
 if u don’t want to farm, and have the caps, then buy it from someone who farmed the currency and is willing to sell it. 
---
Who's worried? The Europeans? 
---
One does not simply take away weapons from Americans.
---
Additionally, if you have the explosive legendary is that a 15% increase to gun damage and the explosive damage for a total of 30%?
---
If you haven't got it in the next 40 min I got it for you. It'll be that long before I can get back on.
---
Are people (dupers) actually being banned? I haven't seen any posts on this.
---
TOTALLY AGREE! Bethesda, solve it please! Also in excavator advenisting is a blue color version.
---
you sure youre not confusing it for the hunters long coat?..
---
Pay them no mind they are just farming clicks from the 76 hate train.
---
Now they have updated the fireproof perk with the new update to include damage from explosives (TSE shotgun + close range = you exploding) you could remove the 3 points from your Batteries Included perk into Endurance.
---
Unless you are carrying a lot of laser weapon ammo or fusion cores.
---
You do realize that these players are high leveled and that bounties actually help you more than than they hurt you. You loose fewer caps if you die from pvp and you also antagonize players to fight you and you wind up gaining hundreds of caps from leas than an hour of playtime. Id pay to have a permanent bounty on my head 
---
Don’t get me started. 
---
I can make a T60 suit from a boxful of spoons, some basketballs and a few beer bottles. 
---
I'm pretty sure the only way to get the plans is to server hop the civil war re-inacter encounter.
---
Awesome.  I am on a PS4 bought on day one.  Still runs great.
---
That's actually a pretty good idea.
---
This is a separate issue than duping. Duping aids the problem but thats not the root of the issue 
---
That’s why there was a level 100 achievement.  Yikes....
---
Hey, I usually hate on this game on Reddit, but credit where it's due.
---
I've been playing online since the days of telnet MUDs...UO, SWG, how old are you?  An exploit is an exploit you can't pick and choose definitions to absolve yourself of cheating.
---
By using a second character, which in this game is completely independent of the first you are doing a work around to bypass the limited storage mechanic.  This is cheating whether you choose to accept it or not, its still technically an exploit.
---
People doing this don't like the limited storage mechanic.  So they work around it.
---
People duping don't like the poor odds of getting good legendary weapons.  So they work around it.
---
Whats the difference here?  Just because something is commonly done or accepted doesn't mean it doesn't meet the definition of exploit.
---
3 points in agility is most of your special?  I get that they suck at low level, but you are talking like your character is over 50 and you can't bother to put 3 points into enforcer?  That and a 7 lb pump is all you need.  
---
But by all means, stand aorund on a steep mountain side and complain that it won't land.
---
Not going for honorable mention as 'dick of the year', but you have all the tools to deal with them if you take the time to listen and learn.  A lot of us have been at the mercy of scorchbeasts and we adapted.  You can too.
---
Okay thank you, I'll let you know if I can find some/ somebody else helps me out
---
What do you need?
---
I'm pretty sure the fruithat was available for a 1 day limited time at some point, so i'm afraid you missed it.
---
Let's hope they will revisit some of these timed deals later.
---
Lol no. Hard to believe Bethesda would suddenly begin a ban wave, but not yet and also without a single mention of it, following several attempts at fixing dupes 
---
I was doing it as a joke, like those ubiquitous 'I make $30/hr from home!' things. xD
---
Like you said, it's a bit misleading but fundamentally you can get 1800 for one hour's work. :P
---
Had a great combo before I got greedy and tried for healing factor, ended up with twisted muscles her mentality and empathy.... Fuck it 
---
Really? I went weeks without it happening and I don't think I did anything out of the ordinary. 
---
Agreed. I want to live on cuthroat island. 
---
Got my bags packed and ready to leave care bear blvd.
---
Kinda hard to do when OP gives him free views and advertisements. 
---
When did I ever dig through your stuff? I only replied to a comment you made lol also before I said leave fantasy land. I didn’t say to go further into it. I can respond to your other random comments and accusations but I would rather not since we seem to be approaching close to your 60 comment limit and you seem to be getting increasingly upset as your lies and stories get worse.
---
The 10-12 mutants will drop about 50 308 rounds and 50 gunpowder. Lots of different scrap with ~6 benches to scrap at.
---
Only thing missing in this location is ballistic fiber. 
---
"character profile has been corrupted"
---
console?
---
Side note, Do you have speed demon mutation? I feel like I am moving quicker and without me mentioning a friend said he felt the same. He isn't really lagging, but he doesn't have the mutation.
---
Bethesda already replied to a comment about this. They are aware of this sugestion.
---
....what the fuck is wrong with you kid lol
---
Lol no it’s pretty funny tho I found out about it today weird bug 
---
Yeah. It's not like they just dropped a patch fixing like over 100 things. Get it together, Bethesda. 
---
My bad xb1 i edited the post
---
Damnit! Now I need some blinds...
---
yes, a great list. would enjoy it if my game wouldnt crash tonthe desktop every 10min since this patch.
---
BoS Shielded is achieved by buying and unlocking each plan from Pheonix. 
---
That’s just a skill and know how issue, you can solo it with a powerfist. The Queen has Explosive resistance.
---
I got lots of ammo for it. Time to swop out and start farming  shotgun ammo with my rifle.
---
Poor mole men won't know what hit them this weekend.
---
Have you server hopped a lot recently or just joined the game and someone elses camp was in the place where your camp was? I don't know if that is exactly how it works but it's possible.
---
I'll send you a message on xbox when I get on.  That way you can reply back if you still need it.
---
I know, I gotta try it out now lol
---
I made an automatic scattered beta wave laser rifle that destroyed enemies, but broke after about 40ish shots fired...
---
Most events give 30-40 caps, plus depending on what you kill 50-70ish caps from bodies per event. Im guessing hes doing 10-20ish events  a day, which is about what I do. I also have alts I stock with .1 weight high value items i craft with rubber plastic and glass and sell for 30 caps each to 4 merchants each on 4 alts.
---
Just leveled a toon from 3-15 at Whitesprings for max charisma and ooh boy I wish we had some variety
---
Tesla rifle is a rifle, which we shouldn't really have to figure out on our own. Would be nice to have some cue to use martial artist with the gattling gun.
---
Maybe make it a tdm like event. Most kills means winning team all get a random legendary. Make participation mean you lose no iunk upon death to encourage users to jump in if they see the event nearby 
---
GT MadDogMolina 
---
I think the hate at this point is what people call a dead horse to those people we fucking get it you hate the game you hate fallout? Anything else? Like really Anything else you got to say preferably a original Thought? No? Just he same shit repeated 10000s times I thought so can you go please enjoy something you like then? 
---
you'd definitely see people trying to hide their bases, rather than set up right in the middle of the golf course 
---
They do
---
this is not working for me. I have 3 levels of fireproof and dense armor mod, and Im still able to hurt myself w/ explosive weapon area effect.
---
Anti-TSE armored statues in power armor that can chew down any one trying to use one of those weapons. Am very ok with this.
---
Yep, Grenadier and Explosive Expert
---
Get the armor, forget the mods, only put them on endgame armor, they’re too valuable
---
Will check it out thanks. I refuse to run whitesprings, over it
---
So I've tried level 3 with Dense and it doesn't seem to mitigate explosive damage at all. Using a TSE shotgun.
---
Supposedly that’s fixed in the new patch, it’s in the notes.
---
I don't think so.  Definitely not nearly as much as my peak in the past few weeks. I dont think so about the camp.
---
You are probably correct.
---
blehhh stop trying to convince me I just don't care LOL   
---
I'm picturing a LOT of women walking around with some serious head tilting.
---
This might explain why I can never stay for over an hour holding a workshop, without a crash to happen in between. 
---
No, no mutations at all.  From my end it feels like I'm trudging through molasses, but every half second or so it goes back to regular speed for a quarter second. Really frustrating, kind of feels unplayable
---
I mean you could always use a Gauss Rifle for a sniper build. That's how I adapted to the lack of legendary hunting rifles (Also the fact that their damage  is quite low for higher levels/endgame stuff).
---
I wouldn't mind this for my Rifle/Heavy weapon/power armor build.
---
Your entire Reddit history is you selling keychains from your site...
---
I think the point is being missed here. My point was that any allocation that requires you to have special perks to take one specific enemy is not equivalent to having an ability that everyone has access to regardless of their build. Yes, I exaggerated a bit using the word “most”. I’m also a more casual player whose highest character is 40. And even with the perks mentioned, switching out perks in the middle of combat isn’t the most ideal.
---
Absolutely on point.
---
I feel like this would make it too easy. I like that you have to go farm these materials. Gives me something to do and I enjoy it
---
really anything you can spare please
---
Both of my characters are heavily mutated.
---
Marsupial and speed demon on their own are great. Herbivore or carnivore too.
---
Note i play solo so i don't have the full strength of them going on.
---
The server feels more responsive, though I got two crashes to desktop in the first half hour which isn't normal. Once every couple days is more common.
---
Its a really good patch from the looks of it. So many important and old issues fixed (Lever action animation, the end of a era). Important cards changes etc. Love what I am seeing but we will have to see how far these updates are going to carry the game. Even a bone can seem like a feast if you are hungry enough if you catch my drift. Not even a hour after the patchnotes got released people were already yelling about all the other stuff they want. We have to stay realistic about some wishes. The craziest I saw was having more than 1 camp. Like really....
---
They should have a timer if they don't engage in any combat in like one minute or something then they respawn. Or put their spawn point somewhere a few feet above the ground so they get dropped in.
---
Yeah, there would have to be BASE items added for camouflaging. That is until everyone unlocks concrete and rocket sentries, then there would be fortified castles everywhere.
---
It’s disappointing the devs overlooked this feature. FO76 could have been a rather brutal and intense survival simulator.. Especially if stimpacks had cool downs and dying dropped all the players gear.
---
Just Google the code 
---
Or even if we could set a chassis as a favorite, at least you could mark one for quicker deployment
---
Never seen QOP before. Quality of Play? 
---
What code? 
---
What’s duping?
---
Do you need the number for a crisis counselor?
---
What's entitling about expecting to get the product that you paid for.
---
If you bought an expensive microwave that sometimes heats the food, but at other times doesn't. And doesn't have features like defrost like it was advertised. Would it be entitled to be upset?
---
On launch, it was a hot mess. Updates are barely coming quick enough. They promised it as a live service with constant new content (Christmas passed, not even a mission to get a hat) and many features that were showcased before launch are not in the game.
---
I think they atleast have the right to be upset with the product. 
---
PS4, Xbox One, or PC?
---
I run a 15/6/3/4/14/8/6 build that is very flexible with Heavy Weapons, Shotguns, Explosives, or Melee, including Power Armor. I built up as a HW/explosive/PA perk loadout first, and then started adding melee perks and now shotgun perks as I get into the higher levels. I do not run them all at once- explosives stay equipped, but it’ll be HW OR Melee OR shotguns. But I’m on PC with Perk Loadout Manager so I can swap decks with a couple keypresses and about 1.5 seconds.
---
Everyone should be over it now that they nerfed glowing xp and the whitespring robots 
---
Ahhhh I’m on Xbox rip, thanks for the offer tho 
---
if they played the game more than 10 hours they would be aware of the ~~suggestion~~ problem 
---
PC
---
Nah it's meant to be like one of those prop guns with the banner that says "bang!" Except you're doing it to yourself
---
I hope they fixed the issue of the game crashing 50% of the time when I take out or put anything in the stash box
---
Yeah that was the point I was making earlier. I was making fun of myself for hanging on to them in the early game. 
---
Well that's good.  Only a week to go
---
Also don't forget sentinel armor. -15% dmg whilst standing still as well as -8% player dmg.
---
I got my jetpack. No need for this thread anymore.
---
I'm a little disappointed with the white spring experience nerf, but I get it. And I almost never used my vampire weapon to heal while not hitting anything, so I guess that's fine too.
---
Yes, unless you use the Mistress regalia, but then you can wear other armor, sooooo
---
Almost like they have priorities. You know, fixing game breaking bugs
---
You are still burning out players each time you kill them in less than a second...
---
You wont get to do this for long if the player base drop to much because some £¢@±££± dumbass dev thinks weapons with that much damage are ok...
---
Ha, a week. Teaming had been bugged since beta on all platforms. My friends don't even bother trying any more we just use psn chat and keep lone wanderer up.
---
You mean level 3 locks ? 
---
At most players bases who lock them lol,
---
Top of the world has a few and most places I have gone to they range from 1-3 
---
Ehhh m79 got nerfed hard and only has one blast before a long reload... Would be better with Quad on it but I like those perks
---
It’s only worth the perks you choose. Chose wisely.
---
[https://nukacrypt.com/solved](https://nukacrypt.com/solved)
---
I'd like to be able to put deep pockets on Scout Armor, Then I might actually wear it
---
Can't wait for Fireproof on console. Hehe that explosive tickles.
---
Because no lie that a quality bug from quality coding. 
---
They've been bugged. Just sell something and it will display the correct amount
---
Most of us are. 
---
I’m happy it’s getting fixed. I almost wish I had held onto the game rather than sell it...
---
There’s no water source nearby so I don’t think it’s purifiers and there would need to be a TON of invisible wires to make up 40% of the budget. I’ll submit a ticket Incase it is a glitch (which I hope it is, or else that means I’m Seriously blind)
---
I tricked some lower levels into taking a jump they wouldn't survive by jumping myself (with bird bones and goat legs) and surviving. I picked them up afterwards and they thought it was funny. I still play with them 100 levels later. 
---
Mined fixed after a clean install
---
Copying items in your inventory, duplicating them. 
---
Involves causing the server to forcibly disconnect you and corrupt your save so it rolls it back to a previous save.  Effectively doubling whatever items he wanted to duplicate.
---
Same here. I'm currently in the process of trying to remove that one but RNG has not been on my side. Even so, I just killed the SBQ the other day with Empath on, so I suppose that's a sign that I don't *need* to get rid of it right away, but it was definitely tougher than usual. I've gotta either convince my teammates to run Empath or keep on rolling the dice to try and remove it.
---
Waaaaah!!!! 😖😖😖😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢
---
As long as you are okay with waiting for the payout lol
---
Bethesda, you can't go bankrupt soon enough.
---
You have to realize that there is no scenario where anything but the exploit getting patched happens right? Because of player trading you cant delete items or rebalance them to make them useless because of the amount of players youll piss off who paid thousands of caps to get these items from players. And you cant ban the dupers because the amount of times these weapons change hands means theres no way to successfully track down these players. Best case bethesda patches these exploits as they are discovered. We have a very similar situation to
---
GTA V rn. Rockstar patched the exploits as soon as they could but rarely did anything about the people abusing them. Thats just how a game with player bases ranging in the hundreds of thousands to millions works. 
---
My friends have 9-5 office jobs with weekends off, I however chose a career that does not, I like to play MMORPG's like Warframe, Neverwinter, Destiny, and FO76, so people like me have to fucking play solo sometimes. Sort yourself out. 
---
I been there. I'm where to go to put it in. I'm stuck in the enclave bunker
---
I want to say I'm mostly thankful that they fixed the ghost objects in the CAMPS even though I didn't see it listed in the notes.  I was finally able to scrap the 18 industrial water purifiers that have been eating up 10% of my CAMP budget.
---
I have a full set of deep pocketed scout armour I wear all the time. Just buy the mods from the enclave when you server hop for that jet pack 
---
They really don’t fit in that one either, they just aren’t as noticeably misaligned- there’s no gap. But if you look, the door doesn’t actually go in the frame. If you look at the latch side, you can actually see that the pin and deadbolt mechanisms are modeled onto the door, because the door isn’t inside the frame. 
---
Yes i dupe but  i give shit to ppl and sell for in game caps at low af prices  so everyone can stand a chance lol but sure im a bad for it lol now i do agree that ppl who have sold things on ebay should be banned yes but i myself have made no  money irl off this game so there for im not worried i got millions of pounds of duped shit that over the last few months i have sold for caps at nothing more the a few k in caps not a big deal right or i just give shit and any of you here that have bought a gun or armor piece from another play thats has a duped inventory are just as at fault cuz u buy from dupers but u sit here to crucify them to make urself seem like u matter idc i loved duping and selling and giving 100k  stims and bullets and guns to ppl idc i dont regret any of it  lol so pls before you tlk shit  take a min  an think huh that guy that gave me all that shit he mighta  got banned that sucks not all dupers are  bad not all of us have done for our own gain at all my entire  organization has the saame beleif instead  of charging out the ass for a gun  we sell for 1.5k caps and boom theres your god tier roll enjoy   lol
---
Does it stack with incisor? 
---
The part you might be missing is that scorchbeasts aren't meant for you to just stroll by one and decide you are going to bash its skull in at your leisure.  It is the apex predator of the game.  Sure swapping cards mid battle sucks, but most builds have a select number of cards for this purpose.  
---
If you get attacked out of the blue by an apex predator, you try to survive it not make it in to a necklace.  If you want to always be prepared you can carry a lev 5 pump action that is purly a stock weapon and a hundred shells and keep one point in agility and one enforcer card to solve your issue.  
---
As a rifleman I am forced to run a single rifle and a lightweight melee for trash that eats my .308 not to mention takes too long to kill with the long reload and bolt cycling.  I can't carry anything else due to rifles being obnoxiously heavy as well as having to actually wear my armor instead of getting the whole suit for 10lbs.
---
If I could solve my builds glaring issue with a single SPECIAL allocation and perk card, you bet your fucking ass I would be all over it.
---
For some reason the game duped everything in my camp that was touching the border of my camp. It's all still where I put it but there are now there also stored copied which it let me place. Not sure if the extras cost  anything on the camp budget, it not it could be bad. I got a second brass lion which is neat.
---
GAMERS RISE UP! WE WILL RULE THE WORLD. Do you HEAR ME STACY? YOU WILL REGRET NOT GOING TO PROM WITH ME AND TAKING CHAD INSTEAD! \*tips fedora\* GANGWEED!!!!
---
Well, it's a 15% increase to ballistic impact and 15% increase to added explosive damage.
---
Heh, I was wondering if hiding in someone else's house would trick people into getting a bounty..
---
Developers want players smashing eachothers things. There are perks for it. Its part of the game. Thats not greifing.
---
Why would they do any of these suggestions? Bounty is good enough. 
---
This changes everything.
---
Dude an M240B weighs like 16ish pounds? That’s a 7.62 machine gun in case you didn’t know.
---
Think of them like Spriggans from ES Skyrim, except they teleport instead of going invisible, and don't have their mind control limited to animal.
---
I think so?
---
That is one of the best spoken voice lines in the game. It's just got one of those cadences.
---
You don't bro once ya a nuke key from a cargo bot. Go to a nuke site and go to the end of it then lut the card in and enter the correct code and then launch a nuke 20 mins tops. :)
---
I'm not too surprised many haven't been quick to bring it up lol. 
---
I did notice this about your character. I'm concerned.
---
I broke down mods during my aluminium drought. I was using a lot for some reason and I couldn't find enough of it.
---
Because you said 5-10 legit dropped TSE in game. 0.5% of 1000-2000 is 5-10
---
If you use the full regalia, it’s already at 100% armor piercing. With just the 50... folks have done the math on Incisor plus the legendary 50%, after 2/3 incisor it’s almost not worth going to 3/3- you get a really minor damage boost.
---
I've gotten a grand total of 4, couple were crappy pipe pistols though. Vendored those, hope they got into someone's hands that could use them
---
Lol if you think Bethesda could do any of that you've never played any of their games before.
---
Not at all, clearly you have no idea what Stockholm syndrome is.
---
Bethesda have themselves admitted to having no way to monitor/edit inventories or detect and identify items. They can't even tell if an item has been duped, let alone catch someone in the act, verify they have duped items and ban them.
---
How an online game can launch without any of these features is utterly beyond me but here we are. Downvote all you want, but it doesn't change the truth. And the amount of work that would need to be done to implement these kinds of systems is monumental, so it's not going to happen any time soon if ever.
---
Uuum.. i feel like you started a conversation and I'm reading the end of it?.
---
What are you talking about bro?.
---
I've gotten zero TSEs on my own. Maybe 5 regular explosives. Dozen or two, two shots tho. Traded for my tses 
---
That's out of hundreds of drops . They are super rare in the wild 
---
perks for more damage the lower your HP, the perk for more damage the more your rads, nerd rage (keep rads at 80% of your HP so its always active), weapon perk for more dmg the lower your hp, chems, bobbleheads, etc
---
Alright I'll try thay
---
I mean look at the state the game came out in lol
---
Add Tyler Country Dirt Track to the list. Trying to defend it but molerats are stuck in the ground. 
---
Ideally you would run in a squad with everyone running all mutations. That is easier said than done though. I usually run solo so empath is pretty inconvenient for me lol.
---
My friend is also experiencing a lot of crashing lately. I get heavy lag while switching servers, or leaving the game. 
---
Wat?
---
I agree
---
It would be fucking hilarious if they were pointing toward an open field that had a single brahmin. 
---
Re-read what I wrote.
---
I didn't say anything about items being deleted from the game (that ship has sailed), I said players should be banned. So any items traded to legit players would remain.
---
Also if you re-read I said about high item counts, I said they should take a hard look at them. As in evaluate if they are cheating, then ban them. Not assume they are cheating. Although the grenade XP glitch is a good example of this. People with 10k+ grenades. There is a certain number of specific items that are impossible to get by playing the game normally.
---
Lastly, this game has pretty much had continuous dupe glitches since launch, so another week? Another 2 weeks? I really don't see the issue since the damage has already been done and is completely irreversible, short of a server wipe.
---
Since it can't be fixed why not punish the people that knowingly exploited these glitches?
---
Variety is the spice of life, after all. 
---
I mean I hope you didnt think I was literally saying you are their hostage.
---
You fucking are dipshit.
---
Duping // server stability effects all.
---
Selling things for cheap from your dupe lot // fucked over our player market.
---
Did anyone else hear a toddler screaming while reading this?
---
Consoles have to wait few more days before the most recent update I think.
---
Exactly what I came here to comment haha well done
---
lol
---
I would like to take you up on that offer. Are you able to craft only for t-45?
---
I only have 10 in my stash box
---
Do you still have the T60 PA? And is it level 50?
---
Hahaha no. I just wanted to see if anyone else had decent rng or is all of my luck just being funneled into this game. 
---
Yeah. Just letting us name it would change a whole lot. 
---
I have one TSE. Got it off the queen just a few days ago. Level 160 with 350+ hours played. I could purchase one if it was under 8k but I'm melee so I really don't need a second gun. 
---
They do not.
---
yup, i've a had tse gatling, a tse lever rifle, a tse radium rifle and a tse minigun. 
---
I seem to have legendary 3\* creatures follow me. Was at monongah power plant, stopped off at the town, a 3\* ghoul pops up to get me, head over the harpers ferry, 3\* ghoul there, turn around to a 1\* ghoul, same as going up to the raider train station at the top of the world, pleasant valley seems to always have a 1\* + legendary waiting for me.
---
Welcome to the console experience friend 
---
Ah, PC here.
---
It's been suggested so many times its just copypasta for both parties. 
---
I gave two to my friends, and then one to a random. I still have my most recent two. 
---
I just want to point out that you're 100% wrong about the private servers, they will be moddable and Bethesda will NOT do anything to control them, I don't know where you're getting this information but it's false.
---
If that gets implemented you should not be allowed to enter a or use anything in a claimed workshop or claim one yourself. This just will not work because its a part of the game. Also not having it work in that kind of way will just add another layer of loopholes people can abuse or get frustrated by when concerning griefers and pvp(workshops)
---
Troll post. AFAIK no one was banned, for duping or otherwise.
---
That’s awesome. Now if only I had an explosive legendary shotgun....hahaha
---
Nah it wasn't so organized. Just some fella firing off a nuke. Only bothered killing the one tonight and got off once it was established fruitless.
---
Wait, wha... are you complaining about Bethesda listening to feedback?
---
&gt;the void beyond the skybox
---
hipster album of the year
---
It can be a real, lonely experience sometimes. Don't have friends to play with really, so kind of have to be in the mood to play. Have only experienced "warning shots" from other players, and the occassional angry face. Other than that, no issues.....yet. 
---
If I got one in a trade and it was gone I'd chalk it up to a shitty person that can't just play the game and duped weapons. That person also technically duped me too so. I also understand self responsibility though, so there's that too.
---
How much cloth did this take, and how much did the frame rate drop after this?
---
Wtf? I dont dupe at all.
---
It pretty much is the end of a really long convo, someone was saying every Tse weapon is duped, I said no. It's more like 80-90% and then 60 some odd comments later I am a lier, I buy guns from fo76 bazaar and I better not be seen there again. 
---
Its not just Raider underarmor, BOS Knight, Officer and Fatigue underarmor also reduce Power Armor resistance. I am pretty sure there are more underarmor that have the same bug. I have only found the vault suit underarmor to work as intended, and is what my Power Armor build has been using until the fix the others.
---
Pretty sure businesses know this, and know what they’re doing (mostly).  The last thing they care about is the customer.  They only care they do what is the cheapest way forward for the biggest profit, and utilizing whatever psychological tactics help.  Business 101.  Least of all, do they care about Reddit posts from nobodies on the internet (especially ones that have already purcha$ed the game, and even more so, preordered.)
---
Didn't read any of it but its past your bedtime to be coming up with your duping fanfiction that will never happen.
---
Did you just call his character chubby?
---
Crashing during rather light queen battle and freezing near Charleston. Can't be in the Order of Mysteries if I can't vistit Riverside Manor. Please fix this. 
---
Yeah, i had a few good hours - back to normal now, as people come back into the game, i suppose. 
---
One character just froze, again. After 3.5 minutes of not even being able to ALT-F4, I had to use taskkill. Again. Loaded into someone else, watched a loading screen for a solid minute, saw terrain, freeze, game CTD. Again.
---
business as usual it seems
---
His argument for duping vs pocketed weight glitching at the end. LMAO. 
---
I'm level 291. Many hours. 1 tse drop. A 44 with perception. Changed my entire character build for it.
---
The world is nice and diverse.
---
Plenty of different weapons and armour.
---
Interesting creatures.
---
Actually interesting characters and stories being told (even if they're all dead)
---
C.A.M.P.s are a serious improvement over the settlement mechanic and are nicely integrated into the game.
---
Crafting system works very well, mostly, and is simple but effective.
---
Voice acting is great.
---
We also praise when they fix an important issue, and fix it well. Hell, they fixed the damn Lever-Action rifle reload. Finally.
---
See that's crazy, if you don't mind me asking how many hours have you put in? I'm sitting at 150something hours, I know my friends have had 0 drops at 200+hours (thus the reason I gave them one of my TSE) but they also mainly focused on the missions while I just kinda got sidetracked and wound up in places I shouldn't have been for a good 80% of my first 50 levels. 
---
I heard the voice ....
---
Fallout 3 came out in 2008, and Broken Steel came out in 2010. By Comparison, Fallout 4 came out in 2015 and Far Harbor came out in 2016. It's not an unfair assumption to make that cutting off Fallout 4, which was more successful than 3, a year earlier, is because they were diverting resources and manpower to this clusterfuck. Every day they continue to do so means TES VI and Fallout 5, if they ever see the light of day, get less work done on them. What could Bethesda have done instead if they hadn't gone chasing after this idiocy? What joy was taken away from me and other Fallout 4 players because of this doomed experiment?
---
As for your contention to "tell it to Bethesda," well they come here, tool. If your thread tags tell the truth, fairly frequently.
---
I'll be on tomorrow during the day, can help nuke during day if youre on. Acct name is : natEburK
---
Never happen, they just don't care. There have been multiple instances of people showing information to Bethesda about dupers, and Bethesda tells them to "ignore players you don't want to play with'.  
---
As much as people want a fair environment, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter if the people running the game don't care.
---
I got a TSE combat shotgun in a trade...I got explosives Dragon, Cryolator and Gauss Rifles off drops, not TSE though.
---
Based on the posts I see from PC users, this new update has dramatically increased the frequency of DC and server crashes. I guess we'll see of the same happens on console when it hits
---
Could be because a lot of support teams have policies about not telling other users about actions to other accounts. 
---
It very well could be all they are allowed to say.
---
Dropped about 15 frames...each one is 2 cloth and I’d say it about 3400 and some cloth because this was before the stash upgrade and wanted to get ride of a lot of cloth, like from the pre war money and since they aren’t all mine I could hit them. And I did a lot you can get a 10,000 cap bounty and I learned that courts don’t show the same on all screens. On my screen I had a 12,000 cap bounty whilst my friend said I only had a 9,000 and some bounty needless to say it was a weird day
---
When I first got my TSE radium rifle I changed my build, shortly after I found a Tse lmg, then two shotguns (same server so maybe lucky seed rng?) and now I have my gauss rifle that I bought recently for something like 1k caps because it didn't fit this guy's build. I think it's crazy, I'm sure rng has something to do with it. Lvl 120 and 150something hours in. 
---
I’ve never had more than one. What are your strategies for getting multiples?
---
My only real gripe on this game is the weight limit *sigh* I'm overencumbered 95% of the time. 
---
Mine are not duped.... its part of the reason i am annoyed they are massed duped. Mind you i would willingly give mine up to see all dupes removed.
---
I did the same thing brother. Hung my head in shame for a solid Vault-Tec minute. 
---
Samesies ..and froze in Charlestown as soon as I fast traveled there...AND got disconnected during a very tame queen battle. 
---
Yes it is. They have not taken a stance. Its unlikely they will take action as all the mods are interface or cosmetic. That said, there is no guarantee that will hold forever.
---
I can’t imagine crashing or disconnecting any more frequently than I already have been over the past week or so. Not looking forward to the patch. 
---
Don’t worry In 4 days they gonna release update n fix that 
---
More like a single ghoul
---
45, 51, and 60
---
In reality there really pointing to a aluminum harvester 
---
Shit sorry man I misheard you.
---
Adam, can we have Greg's arm back?
---
I don't know what it is but almost every time someone asks I have passive on. I swing my super sledge. Nothing happens. I say, "Oops. One second".  I swing again and it makes the ch-ching sound and someone says some variant of "Thanks" before their microphone fades out. Only Fallout 76. What a bizarre game play mechanic. 
---
That's what I was thinking, rank two incisor and then rank one of the swing speed carry weight perk
---
Hello there
---
And it gives more resources when mining ores and increased carry weight. You can increase other armour carry weight yes but at level 97 I haven't found that mod for my X01.
---
I've spent many... Well ingame hours using the increased carry weight looting Whitesprings and Fissure Prime because my X01 is encumbered.
---
So...... Really. It isn't beginner only armour. Even if it is so is Leather Armour but it gets paint schemes. 
---
I put my base in the lake, not aton of traffic but I've had a few people stop by. I'm trying to set up a shop.
---
Fuck that ho idea 
---
That's insane
---
Some of us refuse to trade cause of you duper’s because we don’t want duped shit, we’re not cheaters, so stop your BS assumptions that everyone else is guilty too for buying from you crackhead dupers.
---
I hope this isn’t false cause you all deserve to be banned.  You’ve ruined trading for good honest people who don’t want duped stuff.
---
I have become the very thing I swore to destroy 
---
About 20mins ago I found 3 in one run, one 3star
---
That's alot of shit talk for someone who spends time playing a game written by them. If their skills are so bad then don't play and go troll somewhere else.
---
Indeed it is
---
I've only killed a couple of Megasloths so it was either the one that sometimes spawns under Treetops in the Mire, or one I had to kill for the "Someone to Talk To" quest with the vox interpreter. 
---
Cranberry Bog makes sense - I didn't explore as much over there cause I was scared of the Scorchbeasts lol. But now I've killed a couple by myself I'll go back and take a good look, cheers :)
---
Nope, I tried posting to encourage Bethesda to delay the patch on console until they figure out what it broke on PC, but it got buried by folks who were apparently satisfied by lighter bobby pins.  *shrug*
---
Resources and being centrally located to the areas you fast travel the most.
---
Wouldn't it just be easier to add a plan for each of those items? I know itd be a pain in the ass to find such plans but itd worth it (much like the homemade rifle) once theyre found.
---
I'm saying this is pointless and you immediately called me a liar. Are you getting upset? I'm not. You just dropped a link the a comment in this same post... You are insanely dense. How are they lies or stories? You are being a troll and wasting time tip toeing around the facts. Call me a lier all you want but you wouldn't be shit without dupers and can't get off the tit. How am I upset?? You have consistently proven my point and ran yourself around in circles. You need something to do buddy. Go to bed. 
---
Good luck on getting all that plastic 
---
Thanks for actively making this sub worse. That's not what their comment said at all.
---
Feel like most of my time now is dropping in to grind. Before the "fixed" the spawns a moth or so ago I used to get like a legendary per ghoul in whitesprings. I can do the whole golf club now and get none. Wendingo used to drop like 4 legendaries each. 
---
I get dozens of legendaries they're just all shit. Save for my two shot collection. Not sure, at work now. I can check later though at least 200 hours tho
---
I go through maybe 60 1 star armors for every 3 star. Feels like TSE is a super rare combo considering the sheer number of armor pieces it can roll. 
---
Sold my two shot lever action and it took me weeks to find another. 
---
Any weapon over 2k damage will one shot you still. Adrenaline tested with full Sentinel/Assassins + padded. 45% + 40 + 75 + 50% That is how much explosive resistance I have and I still die to any weapon over 2k.
---
That’s what I want in the future as well. I just started getting really into the game like a week ago and I have really high hopes for the future
---
At this point I think even explosives are hard to come by. I've seen one myself that wasn't Tse. 
---
Keep in mind with class freak most negative effects are nerfed
---
I presume that answers the question "where is most of my carry weight going to" before this patch.
---
I got it the week it came out but just got really into it recently. I put my camp by a rusty anchor on the lake so that's what I want to name my shop.
---
so you basically turn them into Popeye
---
I'm hoping their trade increase to 25k means they're confident duping is over
---
Philanthropistical
---
Cool, now I want to be a Chef
---
Damn rip the legendary era 😨
---
I am playing new low level characters, I do not need or want free stuff that completely blows off the already easy progression curve. Wish trade was actually a thing in the game but all the bugs and bad interface makes that impossible, and the fact no one has an idea on how to price things.
---
Just drop your junk do not waste your time going out of your way. When I see a paper bag I pick out whatever I like that I do not consider game breaking, but I actually want to forage the wastes slowly and peak under every rock.
---
Goodnight buddy, have fun complaining over the internet. 
---
You got em!
---
I couldn’t afford repairing good armor that required it which is why I craft my own trapper deep pocketed. If trapper requires ballistic fiber to craft and repair now when it didn’t, that is whack 
---
Stop it banning people for an exploit in a broken game is not ok.  They are cheaters but all they did was what was allowed to them.  Worst case scenario reset their accounts and let them start over but they paid money for the game and should be allowed to play it.  Honestly Beth should just remove all Legendaries and start over compensate everyone with a crafting token to make two 3* legendaries of their choice or something but otherwise full wipe of current equipment that isnt craftable.  Then next content patch make all Legendaries craftable via breaking down the specific trait multiple times and learning it.  Maybe certain abilities have less breakdown requirements will other more over powered ones have more.  This reinvigorates the market for real and allows people to trash weapons they dont use to eventually craft the type they do.  Limit crafted legendaries to 2* or basically one less of whatever the future max is and make the crafting mats expensive enough to be a hinderance maybe even a component that needs to be purchased from enclave for like 10k caps.

Just because I don’t feel like making a full response again you’re doing things people who get upset usually do. You throw things out make insults and create random narratives when you have nothing else. Im not going to get into specifics because your comments speak for themselves. I don’t feel like getting into a personal battle over a lie you told on the internet. Who cares move on.
---
Oh I'm sure it is, that's the reason these two people had to get off by complaining over the internet, the option to farm the bazaar is over and now they have to earn it. 
---
Yes. Paired with Class Freak and Escape Artist 
---
Mind blown.
---
Don’t think you know what a complaint is lol
---
There’s a shack full of safes somewhere near Tyler county dirt track my wife stumbled upon. Had at least a few level 3 safes. 
---
You shouldn't have to thank them for doing something they should have done at the beginning. I like fallout 76 but they truly ignored everyone 
---
Ok for the benefit of anyone finding this thread - 1Alrawn1 is \*right\*.  I leveled up a new character to 15, and took it to Watoga Stn.  I logged in and out, rejoining the same server by joining a friend.  The trader's inventory changed with each login.  I was able to buy Handmade plans on logins #3, 7 and 9, in less than half an hour.
---
I think I got unlucky before, and possibly wasn't looking at the right traders each time, and also I think the availability of Handmade plans might not be all the way up to L40.  I tried several times at L14 and they weren't there till I ticked over to L15 too.
---
I see from the Inside the Vault blog that plan availability is on Bethesda's radar so perhaps this will get resolved before too long.
---
I think turrets should be made from weapons we have/find. There would be a huge/frame that's upgradable/has higher ranks for more health, but the weapon comes from us for it's damage.
---
That way it Powers up as we do and fits the lore of building a makeshift turret ourselves from salvaged parts. It would also give all the variability of different roles (long range use rifles, short range use shotguns, rocket launcher for big dmg, cryolator to slow them in a high damage area, etc).
---
Spare some flux?
---
Wish I could of seen it. 
---
So people are still duping after the patch?
---
Only one person can tell us.
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer 
---
&gt; I’m a grammar nazi and my comment is filled with grammatically incorrect sentences and phrasing
---
People in glass houses, dude...
---
See. There it is again. Calling me a lier. I'm definetly not upset over you refusing to provide proof, I'm not even upset that this was a huge waste of my time. You need a reality check if you think that "you are doing things that people usually do when they get upset" you called me a liar first remember? You won't give a real response because you are wrong. Like I said before. Goodnight buddy. 
---
I dont mind loosing the caps. My account being whiped however i do mind.
---
Yes, he played the in game version of Fallout 76.
---
I found a 3-star just outside of the Station on my first visit post-patch.  I think you have bad luck.
---
Are you sure it wasn't psychcobuff? I thought paychotats and med-x recipes weren't in the game. 
---
&gt;Fallout has always been about taking the time to build yourself up and be super strong.
---
No, that might be what it's "always been about" to you. I can assure you it's not that to everyone, nor is it meant to be, nor should it be.
---
i remember hearing that the pip-boy won’t tell you if your addicted to something. try using an addictol and see if it fixes it 
---
Yeah, not true. Had two myself just vending crap.
---
It's like a Quality of Life mutation. It's convenience. It's not optimal in my opinion. You can heal up using food or whatever, but you're losing stats from chems even if you use Class Freak.
---
Are you on Pc? Cause console update is next week.
---
I try to ignore the dupes, but I would like fresh start servers. In fact I think they should make a variety of servers like pvp always, pve only, match my level range, full, and empty.
---
Calling someone a liar just to be a troll isn't complaining? I think you are just upset they patched the duping. Go lol your ass back to Facebook. 
---
it would be stupidly simple and take about an hour to design, test it after lunch, have it checked into code repository by the end of the week.
---
You’re comparison is a bit wonky to be fair.
---
In general, games tend to have bugs, they’ve been a part of the industry for quite a long time.  It’s rather standard, as sad as that be, for a game to come with bugs especially online games. However, games can be updated.  They can be fixed after you’ve taken them home and are all nice and cozy.
---
For things like microwaves, it’s not the norm to take it home and it be broken or have issues with it.  The company who creates it can’t update it while it’s at your home.
---
Yes the game was a bit of a mess at launch, but in comparison to similar games like Conan and Ark, it’s launch was beautiful.  
---
Yeah I like being within walking distance of a vendor and I’m somewhat within walking distance of a lot of copper which I use a ton. I do find myself being too far from a lot of places I want to fast travel to, but I have a steady flow of caps coming so I’m not complaining too much. 
---
I heard that only alcohol addiction shows in the stats. Chuck down an Addictol and see if it helps.
---
I also just found a 3 star legendary in watoga, found a 2shot rifle on em
---
Yeah i know i tried explaining that to someone else that weve basically already jad this before when they said it "doesnt fit fallout"
---
Yes I called you a liar because you lied over rng which is so stupid to lie over. If you’re not upset just stop responding to show how not upset you are.
---
I hope to buy some wares from you soon my friend. 
---
&gt; I did read, you’ve just been berating people who don’t play like you
---
Incorrect. I mocked people who shoot themselves in the foot, then get upset when people suggest they don't shoot themselves in the foot
---
Add me on PSN: r_castro33
---
Take an upvote...and get out.
---
Well, also the damage output is ridiculously low compared to meta ballistic TSE, which it seems EVERY other player has now
---
I have a few extra hazmat suits and some purified water
---
Yes I am.
---
Aren't there perks that make it cheaper to make PA? Also there are a few great places for farming springs and screws. Sugar Grove for instance.
---
That would also be cool, like the putt dlc in fo3 where you could make ammo fdom steel there
---
The patch isn't out for consoles yet!
---
Not everyone is like this. It is unfortunate that some are. Personally I have an explosive shotgun and farm whitesprings a lot. However If others are around I try to let everyone tag all the enemies before I shoot them. Either that or I switch to a less powerful weapon.
---
&gt;What is the point of slap damage being a percentage of damage done?
---
The point is that the design team has zero idea what to do with this game in an online pvp setting. Which boggles the mind because it's not like they couldn't have looked to a dozen other existing examples on how to solve these common problems, but eeeeeeveryone thinks they're the special snowflake.
---
when people use tse shotguns on the mobs even after I tag them their bodies bug out and I cant loot them.
---
I just picked up the plan from taking over beckley, I already learned it. You can have it if you want, gt O918. O is the letter)
---
I like it, no more eating pounds of food to heal
---

---
If the improper system benefits people who exploit it, then those people are victims of the system, and we will only change if we all recognize that. 
---
Well i never saw the appeal of rick and morty if that makes you feel any better so it didnt even cross my mind when i said it
---
TSE Laser with scattershot is actually not half bad. Thing is it breaks even faster than minutes, seconds :(
---
If ash piles weren't bugged I'd suggest everyone just use Tesla rifles and Tesla coils in whitesprings
---
Pacify has no effect on what other people can do to YOU.
---
It just makes you helpless by preventing you from being able to damage other people.
---
Naive design decision or trolling political statement? You decide!
---
I agree it seems to be nerfed after the latest patch (PC).  If you're on a console you're not going to see it until next week.
---
Really? Shit, it makes me even more disheartened about so many issues and bugs
---
xou are addicted to alcohol. 🤡
---
Looks like console
---
I was playing with a friend and a few of his buddies joined. I dropped a bag with a few stimpaks inside my portapotty and one of his friends went inside to get them and my friend closed the door on him... he was over weight by a good amount apparently and couldnt fast travel out lmao. He was about to leave and rejoin before we opened it. 
---
obviously, but to say we love them for being bad to us is stupid. Obviously no one likes that they released an unfinished game, but it is very VERY rare for a game company to ACTUALLY listen to their customers and fix what they are asking, and not just release a patch with minimal effort and fixes. 
---
I don't think so - I think we just happened upon them trying to move stock to a lv2 alt, and we distracted them long enough to *almost* get nuked - because if the alt had been killed, it would have dropped *all* of its junk, which we would have immediately stolen.
---
That explains it 
---
A reason is they have higher budget as far as I'm aware so you can set up a cool fortress. And you can save the blueprint for later.
---
They didnt intentionally make screws springs and gears scarce though, the only difference from FO4 is now theres a repair and craft mechanic in the game that now eat them.up at huge rates
---
Yeah I asked them to switch or not use it, no response. 
---
PC.
---
Let's you hoarde stimpacks for when u need em. U can buff them with a perk too 
---
Thanks. I farm the forts pretty regular, not defiance though. Ill find it.
---
I'm pretty sure the Gatling gun says it has a pretty high fire rate (400). But that thing seems to last pretty long for me whereas my Gatling plasma (96) lasts for only a few kills. Unless those numbers are just random and don't actually count as the actual value...

Does the fact that junk extractors exist already stop you from scavenging for the resources they produce?

---
Sorry its been dropped but yeah it was 
---
No that would be called trolling. You just did it with your made up assumption again lol. I don’t feel the need to try to attack you personally I just called out a stupid lie and if you feel offended you’re not handling it very well.
---
Workshop blueprints have higher budgets as well?
---
Well a full set of marine armor with buttressed mod gives 193 DR while a set of heavy combat armor with BoS mod gives 226 DR. If you're looking for a balanced armor to give both DR and ER I think BoS Heavy Combat is the way to go. If you want pure DR he doesn't have all the stats in for heavy metal with polished mod, but that would be the highest by far and I'm guessing it would be over 300 somewhere. The ER would be much lower though so if you go up against lasers you'd feel it.
---
Beauty. Will finish up and join shortly

That could also work well

"MoNeYgRab"
---
I know its not 100% exactly what he was saying maybe read the subtext? He was basically complaining that they were making fixes to issues that do benefit people, but is not intentional. like the vampire weapon fix. 
---
What in the fuck is this..? Can’t I just get some Brotherhood flags, Nuka Girl standees or something lore inspired? Christ almighty. This is worse than Fortnite.
---
I saw power armor frames getting left behind when players fast traveled. But not as many.
---
I had more disconnects than usual after the patch, I froze just as much too. SBQ seems much harder to kill now, last one we tried to kill got stuck in one place in the sky and never came down.
---
But the loading screens are a bit better I'll say that much. Also, yay for not being able to accidentally scrap Hardened Mass. 
---
Whoops sorry that’s spring pricing.
---
great when youre exploring, and questing,and so on
---
has a little downside when youre on long fights like the queen, but you can negate most of it anyway
---
Cheaters are victims. I guess I shouldn't be surprised to read such BS in this victim culture we live in... But wow. 
---
They are. Im happy I got an Explosive Dragon and Gauss, which is what I wanted. But they werent TSE or Instigating Explosive. So I gave them to my teammates who have put them to good use.
---
Okay I'm not losing my mind then. Seeing the same load behaviour. On the "second" load screen when it comes back, the 76 vault door icon spins at warp 9 for a few seconds, too, before the fade-in.
---
Haven't met the Stair Phantom yet.
---
Like the budget you can use to build stuff, so you can set up more defenses. I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure I can build a lot more turrets and stuff at workshops. Whatever you build at the workshop you can blueprint. It makes it easier to put stuff down if do it regularly so it saves time. I haven't made a blueprint yet but I know it's an option.
---
They need to let you keep a base and load into it like a camp. If taken too bad or only load servers with your workshop available. Might force people to actually raid  and force you to actually care about your workshop. It's not worth my time claiming them in the first place
---
Idk whats going on with the CAMP spawn points. I was able to move my camp around to change the spawn point for myself but it wont work for my friends and they end up spawning inside my ground floor stuck until i move it. Then once i logged out of the world I made the CAMP in my spawn point stopped working and keep spawning at my original spot down the hill from my camp while my friends still spawn in my floor and moving it doesnt work this time around for my personal spawn point. 
---
I would love the idea of a town. Definitely would love to make my own diamond city with other players. 
---
Lol they released it today :) it’s probably just me tho
---
welcome to my world
---
That made me lol louder than intended.
---
Dang thanks for the response.
---
Not that I know of. You can still get handmade (and other weapons), by doing the Patrol Duty event at the prison. I know because I got it at level 70 something after doing it about 30 times.
---
This is an amazing idea. I'd totally help settle a town. 
---
As soon as I see someone with a bounty I will spend hundreds of caps in fast travel to get those 5 caps
---
My dude here keeping the facts. I’m amazed people still play this game 
---
Yeah. Seriously
---
I managed to get it after maybe 8 or 9 attempts around lvl 18-20 - but now I'm after Lever Action! Got a higher level character that has one (not the plan though) and love it!
---
Have i played fallout before?  
---
I have thousands of hours in the fallout series, nothing has really felt tedious until this kast one with the everlasting grind for springs, gears, screws ect...  
---
The only thing that was close was FO4 before they added shipments of materials
---
Im on xbox one x, so I didn't even get the patch yet, and I've crashed 5 times now in about 2 hours tonight. I rarely crashed more than once per session prior. 
---
... because they're all fucking bugfixes. No QOL... any other Dallout game and the mosding community would've fixed all this shit in a day or two.
---
None of us should be thanking then for deigning to do their fucking job.
---
You liar!
---
I'd have put in effort if Bethesda would have as well. I did most of the content in the game, and spent quite a few hours in total. Overall, I'm just pissed that the game has gone so far downhill as a result of the publisher not caring about the player base
---
That doesn't really explain it the patch probably did not get rid of already duped items
---
I got the you need to repair your install but then running the checker fixes nothing. Idc that much tho 
---
Ok just be away they take 10 stable flux each
---
Bro why are you even worrying about that??? THE WINDOWS ARE CLEAR 
---
&gt;Also, what features were advertised that aren’t in the game?
---
&gt;&gt; sixteen times the detail
---
 go to Whitespings stand in the non-lootable flowers and enjoy the literal 2-D "screens" Flowers that they used. 
---
&gt;“We wanted every aspect to be better,” he explained, “From the graphics to how the controls work; the gunplay, enemy AI, overlapping quests. In Fallout 4 we tried so many new things and redid so many things we had before, we took our lessons in how you strike that balance going into Fallout 76. We improved the hit detection for Fallout 76, it feels much better but you won’t notice unless you go back to Fallout 4 and compare those two games. There are a lot of things we redid for Fallout 76 that I don’t know if the people will notice.”
---
I remember them saying teammates were ganna be able to build on top of each other pretty much, but yet. My two teammates are good distance away because we actually cant.
---
Holy crap what a baby
---
Game is disconnecting and crashing significantly more often, and I'm on xbox one x so I haven't even gotten the patch yet. Many posts about the same thing on this sub. Any word on what's going on over there?
---
How does Escape Artist actually work? Like, if someone is shooting at you and you crouch you just lose them?
---
Mind if I cross post to /r/vault_tec_corporation?
---
Feel like vendors are more reliable seeing as nobody else can get to them before you.. obviously keep in mind they don't say excavator on them 
---
I pick up the first legendary pipe wrench I find and use that.  Don’t blame the gun, blame the assholes.
---
Not at all 
---
Oh and thanks for the silver 
---
Yeah you're right. The comparison between game and microwave is quite different but the concept and reasoning behind my argument in reply to the person is the same. If you buy a product, you expect it to work, if it doesn't, you are entitled to be upset.
---
My only argument to what you're saying is ARK was a dated game from a private company that was doing something overly ambitious at its time. Bethesda is a AAA title that was porting over a previous game, to multiplayer, that isn't anything innovative and is filled with bugs from the previous that they didn't even bother to fix while porting over.
---
I think you should never expect games to ready at launch these days, but there is a level that is unacceptable. And the only way to redeem that is the care and effort taken after launch, and this case lack there of.
---
Yeah,that was worth waiting 1 month for
---
As I recall the ‘something new’ is intended for later this month.
---
nope this is happening for me to after patch. mostly freezes and ctds
---
Games still a shit hole. So glad amazon canceled my preorder, it’s like they knew.
---
Once you leave that server anything you built will be gone unless you rejoin the server. If you rejoin you will need to reclaim it. Also if you are in a squad and disconnect from the server your workshop owned will be transfered to a teammate
---
There's always several mods and plans at the pleasant valley resort.
---
Theroom behind the level 3 lock in the watoga transit hub often has power armor plans and mods. They're often taken before I arrive though 
---
Isn't that basically what GTA V does? Puts trolls in servers with other trolls?
---
Maybe so
---
What's your rng like? If Noone can give a legit answer or response to my question why even speak up? 
---
Maybe both
---
7 game sessions on xb and 5 on pc/ps isn't a real beta. Anyways, it was testing server load. The amount of bugs the game was released with absolutely justified a significantly longer beta.
---
And so what if it was BGS? That's not an excuse to release it in the state it was.
---
I’m in power armour, and the HUD is plainly wired into the pipboy, so technically for me the radio is coming through my helmet?
---
That said I’ve not noticed my radio getting louder, so maybe it’s purely when you scope out of power armour?
---
How did you get the new textures into Fallout 76? Ive been [porting them into Fallout 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aepwg0/datamine_upcoming_atom_shop_power_armor_paint/) but they are bit off due to texture differences.
---
Ive given up on ever using my 3Star Gatling Plasma. breaks after one core even with all the durability perks. 
---
Common sense? A basic understanding of humanity?
---
How about play the game and make your own impression? 
---
It's a deep, dark place, look in deep dark mines.
---
Yeah but the a-holes are always gonna use the most overpowered weapon in the game. I’m blaming both, the a-holes with the audacity to use it in a nuke zone and ruin the fun, and Bethesda’s GAWD AWFUL balancing (hence the shotgun), giving the a-holes the power to ruin everyone’s fun.
---
What does it do
---
This ‘story’ does not ring true at all. The perps would have just relogged straight away and done business on another server.
---
I have no violet or cobalt. But i can give you 5 crimson, florescent, and and the other one. Whise name escapes me at the moment. 
---
You got taken out while fighting for a resource point.
---
Fair game bro.
---
um... that argument makes absolutely zero sense, so ur saying 2d "screens" flowers means it does not have 16x the detail? How about the fact its a larger world than F4, the terrain is of much higher detail, cells are packed with a lot more entities, etc. etc. 
---
The fact is they did not lie about the amount of detail, just because there are some 2d billboarded items, every single game uses this as a method for speeding up rendering of insignificant objects. What were u expecting, that every single object is modelled down to the molecule or something?
---
I don’t see them claiming 16x more detail anyway in there, friend?  
---
Doesn’t really seem like there’s really anything that they claimed to have and didn’t?
---
The patch did not get rid of duped items, nor is it even active on consoles yet....
---
I have. Over 150 hours. I just want to hear some things from the community I might of missed and hear some cool encounters. That type of stuff
---
All of this should have been in the game already... Looks like at this rate itll be actually ready to play by next year
---
FYI : if buggedthesda say in patch notes that "X" was fixed ,it doesn't really mean that "X" was fixed.
---
My Gf bought it, thinking you can choose each color variant on whatever armor. Turns out she wanted color that is awayble only for T-45 RIP.
---
When you have to cherry pick one specific thing out of thousands as a reason all those thousands are bad, you know maybe you should take a step back and examine why that is
---
She notoriously gives junk/worthless drops all the time 
---
Actually, that perk change is amazing for TSE wielders.  They aren't going to kill the people using them anymore for the cost of two perk cards.  Seriously, I blow myself up 10 times more often than I die from creatures/mobs.
---
This is a pvp as an after thought game as it stands.  Time to kill is ridiculously low and the key to winning a duel is to shoot second/get your opponent (or his team mate) to shoot first.
---
I was thinking the same thing about his last sentence. People can bitch and moan on the internet all they want they still have jobs to do, and even if people didnt say shit they would still be rolling out fixes. This game is a business and job for a lot of people and work isn't just going to stop, and when are people going to finally catch on that this is how big ass online games are made and launch. They start with a frame and build on and around it, fuck it's been this way for almost 20 years now. Online games release with bugs and shitty netcode and they fix it, it's how it always is with every online game.
---
I mean have you played Diablo? You hardly have unlimited storage there.
---
Im aware. I have the mods I want, but have never found the plans. :(
---
Wha... Fck, srsly?
---
Your dad: "I'm not gonna beat you today"
---
You: "Oh, thank you, thank you so much for that!"
---
Me: "Not abusing your relatives is actually normal..."
---
You again: "What?! Are you complaining about not getting beaten today?"
---
Now you can go minus me to the ground with your twisted logic.
---
This is Bethesda’s first online game like this. 
---
This game had issues at launch, but you seem to be over exaggerating how bad it was.  I had a week off of work and lived on the game for 3 days straight.  As unhealthy as it was, it gave me a good feel for the game and while it could have been better for a launch, it certainly wasn’t some hellish experience that they should be shamed for releasing.
---
Yeah but now he's out there destroying my house. Still fair game or just being petty because I managed to actually kill him once... So 1-3 not good for him? 
---
Or of course there's the "but their raiders" Yeah. They are. But it makes me mad that up until now I've had nothing but good encounters. Even in PvP
---
Yeah I can actually play the game my own way instead of the shit explosion shotgun meta 
---
Yellowcake, but yeah, that sounds good! Are you sure you dont want anything in return?? ((also I wont be able to claim it until tomorrow night sadly))
---
Yep same for me, I made from sneak sniper, sneak melee, now we have legendary sniper rifles, well time to farm those levels and get my perks back for sneak sniper.
---
i just got this plan from grafton/greg and it didn't teach me combat dense...wtf
---
Honestly I have no idea, I was mainly just making a joke.  I haven't noticed it at all, though.  It would be cool if it was only out of power armor though.
---
Not really understanding why they cant just implement a basic cut and dry respec option that refunds all your points like so many other games have.
---
It doesn't need to be tied to premium currency. This is already a premium game, a feature other games have done for free really shouldn't be sonething we pay Bethesda extra for when they can't even properly launch the game itself.
---
Current implementation of respecs is obtuse. Theres no good reason for it to be this tedious.
---
If it has to cost something, make it a *reasonable* number of caps instead of say, the ludicrous amounts that serums cost.
---
Maybe lock the option to level 50 if you guys really want to twist everyone's arm about it. 
---
that happened
---
Constantly earlier this morning
---
Oh look more dev deep throating in this sub 
---
Some folks still think it's going F2P, soooooo
---
Yeah
---
With them fixing all the exploits, which they said was the reason. It’s been a lot worse since the patch, I get constant server disconnects. 
---
Ultracite, X-01, Excavator, T-60 with BoS Paladin paint job, T-51b with Nuka Cola paint job, T-45 because it was feeling left out that I’ll paint with something at some point.
---
Car henge up north on the map, the story about the Flatwoods monster turning people's base defences hostile to everyone around, the excitement of running a nuke silo solo. Don't forget all the bitter bitter people, a good ending montage with the credit roll in front of all the people complaining.

Followed some people this morning didn’t have enough fusion cores got raped and ran outta cores got smacked around and used.  I ended up slow walking out of the zone while the queen ignored everyone else and followed me to the edge.  I under estimated her 10/10 would do again.no loot was awarded and I feel dumber for having attempted such a act with only a few cores and a couple stim packs.

Got it from an event around level 140\~ish about a week ago. I don't know if that helps.

I was fooling around in Whitesprings today and there were some lower levels. I got a bunch of ghouls to follow me and brought them over so the lower levels could get some hits but they'd focus on me.
---
I'm standing there using my weakest gun to just keep the ghouls focused and I actually had to get on my mic and tell them to get some hits in. Told them to turn on pacifist and just spray the mob while it was surrounding me then I pulled out my bigger weapon and dropped them all. 
---
Got disconnected a couple of times and always seemed that find low levels I could give some easier XP to.
---
Look at it this way. You put up with this much of the game. The thing that triggered you was an arsehole, not really the game itself.
---
My bet is that any mention of interactive npcs (especially human ones) and related quests/new world space, you'll quietly saunter back.
---
I could be totally wrong and in the end what does it matter either way? Do as you will dude but maybe give it a few days and see how you feel. You may just accept it was a shit circumstance and get over it and get back to enjoying the game.
---
Only reason I use energy weapons is because fusion cells are easy as fuck to find. Also I craft them too with my copious amounts of plastic and copper. So the low damage isn't so bad with the burn damage mod when I'm wandering lower level areas.
---
&gt;Game systems work best and are more interesting when they accommodate everyone.
---
So, you are for a split for pve and pvp servers?
---
Oh whew I thought you were on PC. Take the upvote for fucking their base up 
---
Maybe he's using the sledge because he has no ammo hehe. I don't know. Some people do just want to have a little pvp at workshops. I took Grafton Steel one time that was claimed by someone else because I wanted to test my armor defenses. Super Mutants spawn in with me and started attacking his workshop at the same time as me. They destroyed his Fusion Generator. I can see how he would think it was me, and think I was an asshole for doing it. I didn't though. I just wanted to take it and let him come and  hit me a few times, and I would hit him a few times just to see the damage values. But yeah. Some people just want to Pvp. Some people just want to see what their damage is like or how good a new piece of armor works etc. Or test a new perk. Whatever. I personally didn't want that and I left after he killed me (I just hit him with a few normal knife attacks not power attacks). I think he left the server or something. He didn't reclaim the workshop. I didn't go back either. I felt bad about it as I wanted him to take it back, but whatever. It's just a game. There are plenty more workshops to take and plenty servers to hop to if you want to.
---
Man am I glad they fixed the unscrappable and unplaceable items in CAMP stash bug.
---
I had nearly thirty industrial water purifiers taking up a significant chunk of my storage. All cleared now!
---
Unless they're dumb as shit or we're in the middle of a step that takes a while. Idk how it works but if you're taking your whole inventory out like that I'm guessing thats why they stayed on the same server. 
---
but
---
I'm surprised picking it up at once didn't crash the server. Along with a nuke
---
That said, he did post an image showing a giant bag of duped shit in a nuked zone. 
---
Flamer is odd as well, pretty much turns into a explosive mini gun
---
What are invisible grenades about?
---
Deposit your doubles of plans and recipes. I always leave them for people when i see them heading to an area. If your high enough level leave what you can for a beginner 
---
Explain the montage?
---
I sold my legendary modded tesla rifle today bc i disconnect from server within 30sec to 5 min after equipping it. After the disconnecting within 40 min today I just let it go. Didn't disconnect 1x for the next 4 hours. Nvm the other bugs w energy weapons. It's frustrating for sure (esp since they were always the build i was going for), but I'm really trying to stick with it (why? Honestly bc my buddies left ESO for FO76 and we all cant find a decent alternative to either - though not for lack of trying).
---
I still like FO76, it's just... soo frustrating and lacks continued end-game playability IMO. But I wouldn't have bought any beta game if it werent for my buddies so i imagine some of my issues are fallout 76 specific and some generalized to new releases.
---
Sorry that was a bit of a tangent. But i agree energy weapon issues are devastating.
---
Yo dude u almost like robocop
---
Fallout 4.
---
I’ll be your friend.
---
Yet to check the notes, they touch scaling at all?
---
lol, in reallity you have 250-400hps, so even 150 melee will kill you from sneak. (with egouth armor piercing)
---
Like them being shady at a moonshiner spot. Kinda fitting don't ya think 
---
So, you are for a split for pve and pvp and pvpve servers?
---
Since, you can still pvpve?
---
This isn't politics. It's video games. Get over it.
---
Just a wait and see at the moment gotta make sure its gone. But i am sure they dupers will find a way since its abusing the server save deal from crashing that has a good reason to be in the game.
---
Also seen a thread of a duper bitching about been banned. Sooo maybe they have some way of knocking them out now.
---
Now we just need PvP servers! And maybe when you die you drop ALL your stuff (not just your junk). Would add so much suspense to the game. This, in addition to a fix to auto chat that allows players to hear proximity chat along with their group would make this game really fun to play and may even attract streamers like Summit1g that enjoy sneaky PvP plays which are impossible in the current system.
---
Dota character, queen of pain. In all likelihood, L and P are pretty close on qwerty keyboards, so it was probably just a typo.
---
This is the precise reason people keep bringing it up. How are you going to be so obtuse about this, holy fuck dude.
---
Fine. Look, I'll do the science for you. Give me a second.
---
They are just concerned
---
You only need to tag the enemy to get the loot+exp, i do like when I find guys with tse shotguns, just a single shot from my Tesla rifle and I get a bunch of xp
---
There still isn’t much to do in the game. After killing the queen 100+ times, it gets pretty
---
Old. And they nerfed white springs . 
---
Ah. I see. Good thinking. 
---
Cause that's not how the world works?
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm all for whatever is fun for the most players, realism be damned. 
---
How you act speaks highly of you and I'd act in a similar fashion. I'm just saying I hope you can understand why people might do what they did - because they're people and people can be that way, even when all "logic and reason" (I use that term loosely) would expect you to perhaps do otherwise.
---
Why are you white knighting for a multi-million dollar game publisher? 
---
I can’t see it but did they fix the laser weapons durability? After like 3 clips my weapons are on the verge of breaking, idk if there’s a perk for it but i have gunsmith maxed out so i dont understand  
---
You got it!
---
There is still a huge amount of weight issues in the game, 20lbs guns are stupid. 
---
It's not possible to get rid of non-stackable uitems without support.
---
It is ahaha 
---
How does it not just blow up in your face?
---
Didn't expect that it already exists.
---
I really hope we'll get the option to plan additional things in the future as to what we got now. I.e Cranberries and Sugar Cains/Reeds I guess in this game.
---
I just hit 39 Hours and I've found my second explosive legendary.
---
&gt; **Strangler Bloom:**
---
&gt; This leads me to wonder if something like someone cleansing the river or doing the Heart of the Swamp Event is what actually causes them to spawn.
---
It's been observed that if the event is available, the Strangler Blooms are spawned, but you should farm them in the Dyer river before starting or going to the event area.  Hasn't failed for me.
---
Yeah sure, thanks Bethesda for doing what you're supposed to do...
---
Off the top of my head
---
Features.
---
- Vendor stations
---
- Cut camp content (items etc)
---
- Cut Storylines (Mothman side story)
---
- Live Service game features (Live Service means holiday events, limited time events. Even Spiderman released something extra for Christmas)
---
- Increased detail (The weather systems are great, but besides that. It's fallout 4)
---
And that's even taking into account the amount of fallout 4 assets that either haven't been ported over or will at a later date be released as "new content" or sold in the atomic store.
---
I'm sure if I was to go back through even the limited amount of publicity they dropped just before release, I'd find even more. But those were just things I specifically remember because they were things I was actually excited about and then when I played the game thought. "Hey, what happened to that thing they said"
---
I agree, I loved this game anyway but it's shaping up to be even better. If they'd just let us do something about ammo and fusion cores. That would be awesome. The lever action reload thing is groundbreaking though. Truly beyond happy with that 
---
Yeah. Again, my only real complaint is now my entire camp is a pile of rubble. So... Just miffed.
---
not if they had already put all their items into a box they leave and their items stay
---
I have been enjoying it. Playing with a friend and doing the true West Virginian experience of "Hold my beer and watch this" (We are actually in WV) has been more fun than anything else. Sure we are out of main quests, we make our own. 
---
They haven’t even gotten started. 
---
They’ve said they’ll continue developing on user feedback for a long time, not merely bugfix. 
---
They’re still eating through issues. When stuff stabilizes and matures, I’m expecting to see content expansion.
---
Indeed in World of Warcraft the type of players you would find differed alot from RP,PVP and PVE servers. 
---
A simple option to allow us to choose whether we wish to engage in any form of pvp would be great. While i understand that some players love to destroy camps and kill players. I also know that some of us just want to focus on the PVE side of things. Pacifist mode does not solve that issue though.
---
I think this may be universal... they show up everywhere. The only place I can’t specifically remember ever finding crickets is in the forest.
---
Fuck your parents made a mistake
---
AGREED completely, although one thing I might suggest to keep the options open would be PVE only servers, PVP only servers, AND PVP/PVE like we have now.  The PVP only servers would basically become Rust, which as stupid as it is really does appeal to violent assholes, the PVE only servers would be strictly monster-killing for those of us who don't want to have to deal with hyperactive Adderall junkies, and the servers like what we already have could be for people who like it the way it is.  
---
What I'd truly want is a solo version of the game with no other humans at all, but unless there's eventually a way to do that with private servers, I'm not holding my breath.  But then I'm not holding it for PVE servers either, even that's clearly what a lot of us want.  
---
One day I will be the robocop 
---
😁
---
Did you actually expect a support guy to ban that player right away just because you gave them a picture of their inventory?
---
Cluck cluck cluck cluck
---
And then everybody clapped
---
Perfect for heading into her cavern too
---
I got second hand embarrassment from this post. 
---
There should be 18 holotapes to collect in order to complete the mission. I’ve collected all of them, but yet not completed.
---
There’s been talk about collecting  in a specific order to complete the mission, but which, I don’t know... however this should be a known bug.
---
You're telling me the locations that are saturated with one resource is a random design choice? Likely not. They know what they're doing when they put resource-rich areas on the map that are otherwise scarcely found. 
---
For each resource you listed, there are 2-3 locations that they can be found in abundance. If you don't know where they are, just search the sub. If you do know and it's not enough for your needs, you have a mismatch between sustainment and play style. Maybe you should change the play style rather than expect the whole game to change. I'd love to have a heavy explosives build, but I also know it's a bother to maintain the resources for it and the other drawbacks associated with it. That's not a mistake. That's by design
---
Where did they say we would have player ran vendor stations?  Where are your sources for them claiming to have all of these things?  I’m sorry, but this is the internet and I’m surely not going to just take your word for it.  I could say they claimed we could have flaming rhinos as mounts, but it wouldn’t mean anything without sources.
---
That's a poor argument to make.
---
Because the guys doing the programming aren't millionaires. And I'm fine with giving shit where it's due, but just generalized blanket bitching because it's the current fad isn't helpful or enjoyable to be around. We should be clearly telling them what's good and what isn't, not insulting them for our own enjoyment. Nobody is going to want to make cool shit for a toxic player base.
---
Not in game.....yet unfortunately.
---
I paid $200
---
Why would the robot change matter for legendary farming?
---
The Respec issue really only seems like a problem when you're needing to Respec everything. It works fine for me now as I only find myself needing to move on or two slots around. 
---
Would be nice if they added a whole character Respec somehow. Would likely be at a high cost though 
---
Thanks for posting this. I agree - I honestly am impressed that Bethesda, for all their faults, is fixing so much shit on such a regular basis. Their dev team must be working overtime. 
---
Assassins armor and blocker perk
---
tldr; I PAID MONEY FOR A GAME BUT I BROKE THE RULES OF SAID GAME AND THEY PUNISHED ME FOR IT SO NOW I HAVE TO GO BACK TO PLAYING FORTNITE INSTEAD OF RUINING A GAME THAT I HATE TO PLAY ANYWAYS
---
And I'm sitting here thinking "Who /crafts/ armour?"
---
It does appear on a Levelled List, so it seems it might be possible for it to drop. However, that levelled list doesn't appear to be referenced by anything else, so maybe it cannot drop. I've seen posts of people saying they have seen it. If it does exist, I'd like to see proof.
---
I’m on XBox One and was showing my husband (PC gamer) that the people who say the game is unplayable are wrong. I then proceeded to disconnect twice and crash 3 times. He declared it unplayable. 
---
ouch
---
I dont see many mods that have aluminum. Usually its lead, steel or rubber. 
---
Yeah when i see defend scorchbeast  I just swap servers, bcose they never land = not killable.
---
Curious they shouldn't be able to see your discord without prior invite.
---
I wonder if a cryolator would be useful to slow a melee character down. I don't have any experience with that weapon though. I got an Assassin's one at one point with +10% damage to players but I think I dropped it in a bag or sold it to as vendor. Didn't even test it. I think that was a mistake but yeah.
---
Yeah but no ones ever posted proof only one person with a edited broke image can't remember where the post was. I'm betting it's just not obtainable rn otherwise someone would atleast have a screenshot or be demanding something ludicrous for it or duping the crap out of it.
---
Just having cropped photos of people saying the game is unplayable, broken etc in the background while you list off everyone who contributed to the video and to the ideas at the end. I hope that helped explain it. 
---
I'm pretty sure Beth cannot identify dupers. It's not like they hear an alarm every time an item is duped, or a cheater bears a red flag on his back.
---
I regret not taking video but I server hopped when I got the loot. Since I only started playing earlier this week, I wasn't sure if he could seek vengeance for me taking his loot. Even though he killed himself, I was unclear on the game's rules and didn't want to risk losing that sizeable treasure.  I knew I wouldn't be able to outrun him and didn't want to risk an actual fight with a lvl 1 baseball bat vs his gear, so I re-logged.
---
Yeah the same thing happened with GTA Online, everyone bitching about modders and their infinite money but as soon as they got money they stayed quiet and then bitched when rockstar removed modded money. Grinded 12M on that game before money was dropped on me and I didn't play to spend it, came back with 200k.
---
Thanks man ❤️
---
We caught them in the middle of a big transfer. Between them desperately trying to defend their base, keep us away from their drop bags, and kill us, they didn't see the nuke on their heads until it was too late. If they'd stayed in the nuke zone, all of them would have been killed, and all of their junk dropped. Which may have been what happened, judging by the 37 ton bag we found.
---
Lvl 143 psn 👉 ignoremeow down for queen anytime. Just msg/add
---
Grafton Day? 
---
discord shows when you are in a game but i dont think it goes beyond that do you have similar names for your bethesda account and your discord?
---
THERE WILL BE NO ECONOMY IN THIS GAME. You are NOT getting a global auction house. Player Vending will NEVER lead you to some cap billionare dream. Its going to be server specific. You will still have to add people to your friends list to bring them in from online. Barely anything changes. This isn't a classic MMO. Stop treating it like one. 
---
We just got SERIOUS explosive resistance with Fireproof perk. PvP isn't unbalanced just because of explosive. Its bigger problems than that. You don't need niche items to essentially 1 shot people. You can literally be invincible while standing still with the right armor. Legendary effects are plain SILLY across the board. You're not getting e-sports level balance here, even with time put in. Don't get too excited.
---
PvE? Please have the extra person tagging the SBQ actually be effective. I couldn't care less if someone standing next to me is better or equal, I just want them to contribute. My enjoyment of the game is effected in no way whatsoever.
---
Would you SERIOUSLY wipe thousands of players main weapons on some principle shit? They didn't get duped for a day or week. Its been months. Get off your high horse and rethink what you think "fairness" is. Justice boners aren't worth that logistically.
---
what
---
you'd be surprised to know the ration between players who use reddit and those who don't
---
Ya exactly. You just want the devs to be the "good guys" and the management the "bad guys" so you have something to point to as a positive. Even if you have to make it up.
---
This sub is the perfect example of fanboys lol.
---
Might be an idea! But I haven't seen one in a while.... Would be awesome if the frozen for 2 hour glitch worked against him... Petty griefing on the mind XD
---
Yea, he couldn’t of had any of my info since I never talked to him, so he shouldn’t of been able to send an invite in the first place. Very curious.
---
Once you hit level 50 you are the same as a level 1000.
---
6 wbu?
---
Completely different names. Ones like twice as long as the other.
---
&gt; I've always believed that TSE were meant to be super-rare items mainly for use against the queen. 
---
Queen is immune to explosives
---
What for?
---
it would fit, but it breaks the play cycle. The current play cycle is explore, craft, farm. What you're suggesting is to reduce the farm component and increase the craft component. If you shrink the play cycle down more than it already is, the game will become monotonous. 
---
And making uneducated assumptions about programming prowess isn't? What exactly is the end game plan of talking shit and being toxic? Is the goal to shame their programmers into doing better?
---
I can only do basic c programming and I could write in a unique id attribute to track items. So his statement was either just to be shitty or he really doesn't know anything about coding, in which case his point is moot as he isn't qualified to pass judgement.
---
Bitching because that's what's currently 'cool' to do… shit just gets old.
---
Always needing steel. Other than that im good. 
---
Thought it would be like that off the bat. Sucks when you want to be close to your friends. Since ya know maybe you had some really cool plans.
---
Someone tried taking Grafton from me earlier today...I was stealthed on a rock watching. Armor Piercing Explosive Handmade melted him before he knew what happened. 
---
He came back a few minutes later but I let him have it. Didn’t really care to fight over a workshop that will probably be gone within an hour with the next server crash. 
---
I've seen that before, finding only harpoons cause someone was using a harpoon gun in the previous battle, but that's just the shared inventory showing, the true loot inventory was still loading and you just need to wait.
---
Just went through the silo for the first time and the machine ate my Nuke keycard. ruined my first time :/ 
---
Molotov cocktails.  Drop it at chokepoints and you tag each mob.  
---
I mean, is your ign Grushnak? Because you have reddit spammed to hell and back with it for trades, and google is a thing...
---
They will most likely increase the item levels to 55 60 ect so just live and let live
---
Must've been the wind.
---
Cannibal
---
I'd just leave it @ " **It's annoying that getting DC'd"  :)**
---
Scorched are already annoying, but its a good idea
---
This is an undocumented _feature_ of all bethesda rpgs since oblivion, how can they?
---
What do you mean "what for"? As in "why collect straight jackets"? 
---
They sell for big caps.  Valued at 200 in the item's details; vendors will pay you 40-ish per jacket, if you have 3 CHR and Hard Bargain 3.
---
When does it come out on console?
---
So you’ve had nothing but good encounters. One instance of pvp and you rant like the world is ending. You see how that doesn’t make sense right?
---
You took a resource point. Someone fought you for it. Once the fighting starts it doesn’t always stop easily. 
---
Yes, it is completely fair game.
---
If it helps harpers ferry see it a lot at vendor.
---
I have a camp set up on a lead vein, and just collect as many tin cans as I can as they contain both steel and lead. I'm breaking into the ammo business
---
So much this! If ever single pellet in a shotgun gets it, why not the tesla rifle? I was so excited when I found mine and then sad when it lost the chain effect.
---
Finally!! After all these months of waiting! 
---
Sweet thanks 
---
Weird, I’ve taken unclaimed workshops with stuff built in them. 
---
I'm at 150 hours myself, never had any explosive legendaries. Only 3 2 shot weapons, and only 4 3* ever. Ive spent a lot of time farming legendaries, and know to check multiple * legendaries that don't have an "explosive" prefix too. RNGesus hates me.
---
Dude, thank you. That is a great idea. Better keep pacifist mode on though lol.
---
Graham has them for about 700 caps
---
Yep 
---
I just collect grenades and sell them good profit 
---
You PS4 by anychance?
---
I’m a little bummed that glowing ones are getting a exp nerf... but, with that being said I understand that changes like this will probably only help fo76 in the long run. I’m really looking forward to the first leaks/announcements on dlc for this game and hopefully the community can get some information soon!
---
Sure my IGN is Grushnak, I do plenty of trading. But how’s this dude gunna link the two.
---
I know even if only the first gets the explosive effect fine but atleast dont take my 🌩
---
I have Graham on xbox atm you could get it from him gt martinez2kid 
---
I want it too. If you find a spare Tool Chest plan on PC look me up. IGN: jchamlin
---
If they made it a workshop like the ammo one, sure. However reading that whole chain of you and that guy going back and forth.. You need to understand that you need to have a rare resource, even tho I honestly don't get how anyone runs out of those mats to begin with. Steel is just too common to convert into springs and u get a ton of it from just playing the game. And the point isn't to collect everything, it's to know which items you need. Have extra perk cards to repair armor and wpns to 200%, run the slower degrading perks, run luck of the draw, heck adjust what weapons you're using most of the time based on what's needed for repairs. Just collecting stuff after being just online for a certain amount of time is plain boring. What's the point of rare junk if everything can be acquired with 100% certainty from just being online. 
---
An auto, I believe.
---
ITS THE DUPERS
---
Oh wait.
---
Junk nodes have a 1 in 8 chance to give you a screw - or something like that. It's purposefully slow to procure screws that way. Resource nodes in general are a new game mechanic to fallout and they were deliberately set up in the way they are. You're basically asking for the game to be easier, and it's already an easy game. 
---
Yeah, I know. I tried. The dudes didn’t allow anyone to tag or anything. They just killed as many as they could as fast as they could, no waiting.
---
If my base spot is taken I don’t usually hop servers, I just take a low profile workshop and use it as a base. 
---
You didn’t read the post
---
Actually it took them 4 years
---
This is the closest thing we can acquire.   
---

---
You can learn the recipe by scrapping them.  Of course, they are a rare spawn, took me some grinding to find enough to learn it.  You can also learn the BoS paint for this helmet by scrapping other Combat Armor pieces.
---
They could only do a full wipe... they might not even be able to do that.  If they could they never would.  There would be a freaken uproar.
---
I see big picture so whatever I wouldnt care but the majority would be pissed.
---
Enemies have different inventories for alive and dead, which is why you'll see scorched with, say, a machete but when you kill them, they're carrying a pitchfork. Certain enemies (Mostly Super Mutants) have grenades on them. If you kill one and get to its corpse before their inventory has changed over, and then grab the frags, those frags will still be in your inventory, but not for your use, so they don't get shown (Hence 'invisible'). You still have the weight of them factored into your carry capacity though, and at .5 each, it quickly adds up. And because they're not in your list, you can't equip them or drop them.
---
Juicehead said it's like 35%
---
This is underutilized IMO. Passive mode on to avoid unintended PvP and just tag everything with fire, then let the A holes mop them up wasting ammo and degrading their weapons. Then you waltz among the bodies picking up loot! 
---
You’re cool, do that. I approve and appreciate your courtesy and patience.
---
You have to do it in game. Settings doesn't show it from the main menu.
---
^(Honestly, I think part of the problem is more how perk cards work than anything.  If 'combat' perks and 'utility' perks pulled from separate pools there wouldn't need to be as much respecing or the like (or if the 'damage with x weapon type' perks were more meaningful for the ranged options))
---
But how glorious would it be to see a string of exploding lightning bolts shoot everywhere. 
---
they cant track duped items so they cant delete them
---
Screenshots of trade menus and complaint tickets sent to Beth.
---
It's a substantially long process, but the username is there, the duped items are there,  and it's up to the dupe douche to justify their 200 TSE's and 5000 nuka quantums.
---
If they can't CONVINCE a Dev that they gained their wares legitimately, then BAM, clear their stash, clear their inventory, clear their learned mods and leave them with a scorched pistol, 100 rounds and some wood armour.
---
No ban needed, so they can play still, with nothing but shit stuff for a few hours.
---
Happy to hear ways to improve on my daft idea too :)
---
Lvl 231. 
---
Never ever seen a tse drop.
---
Friend felt sorry for me so he gave me a few.
---
Oh it would be magnificent zeus himself would evny my bolt of exploding death.
---
I don't know which is worse, Bethesda or this sub
---
If your on pc we have perk manager just a simple interface addon that is insanely hard to live without now. Just look on nexus and go to most downloaded for 76 should be the first on the list.
---
I tried repeatedly between 28 &amp; 44 (call it persistence/stubbornness/stupidity...) with no luck.
---
Ended up creating new char and hitting Harper's Ferry as soon as I got to lvl 15.  Picked up 2 plans within about 20 minutes while server hoping for the Marine wetsuit/armour plans.
---
I guess the point of a rant is to get it out? But I could be wrong. And it wasn't really a resource war. At this point he killed me and friends, didn't even use the munitions factory, and then levelled my house. He met me at my camp before he attacked the munitions and went back to destroy it for.... Resources you say?
---
And yes I'm a bit butt hurt and salty. Again, just needed a good rant. Like the world is ending. 
---
I wonder if I have some of these ... how do people find out they have them?
---
Did you guys break the build budget again? I now have no power because I scrapped my other Benny’s to build a fusion generator only for my budget to not have counted the deletion of my other gennies.
---
I’ll be back in 6 months or so when you get around to fixing shit you keep breaking.
---
&gt; obviously, but to say we love them for being bad to us is stupid.
---
So you accused me of not knowing what Stockholm was while you literally dont know what it means? Ok. Not like that was important anyways. I was kinda going for you guys being held hostage because this is the only fallout you will get.
---
&gt; Obviously no one likes that they released an unfinished game, but it is very VERY rare for a game company to ACTUALLY listen to their customers and fix what they are asking, and not just release a patch with minimal effort and fixes.
---
It's really not, that's just the story you want to push, so you can find anything positive about this crap. This is an online service game. Every game company, literally, would be fixing balance issues and bugs. It's also the middle of January. This game came out in November. All of these problems were known in October. The are literally trying to save their own ass, they dont care about you.
---
This is incredibly interesting actually.
---
Yepp, here is one :)
---
*winkfuchtel*
---
thanks for Admitting i'm right tho big of you
---
I got mine to 2.5k caps by farming white spring and hid in uncanny caverns posted my location in commutinys as well as my GT and it was fun 
---
I stopped using my AA-exp shotty at whitespring altogether. Now I'm rushing in with GhoulSlayer &amp; Swing speed dagger - fun and fair.
---
Shotty is now only for solo stuff and Fissure Prime.
---
Yeah that is true lol when I first started around November on the grand opening, I already saw people level 50 and up . I was scarred they would kill me lol now I’m a level 100ish and every time I see a new player , I would trade with them and give them all my plans that I learn already to help them out . I know this sounds stupid but who knows if it’s a new player to the game or a duper 🤷🏻‍♀️ 
---
So your fun is griefing others?, cool...
---
I am sure someone from the community with TSE items will make sure to let you know how it feels soon.
---
I have as well - uncontested and plenty built around it 
---
Its weird. Last night nearly every location I went to had a 3 or 2 star legendary boss to fight. Normally I get 1 or 2 per session no more.
---
Nah it’s fairly rare for someone to come and wreck your base, at least in my experience. 
---
I would love to see plans and recipes you know **GRAYED OUT** in any list you view them in (vendor, dropped bag, trade window).  That would help immensely.  You could still pick up the recipes if a friend needed them, but you'd 100% know you don't need them.
---
RIP mountains of cash I spent on every pocketed and deep pocketed mod 10x over.  Only to find out last week I was missing combat armor chest deep pocketed after buying tons and tons of those plans.
---
Appreciate the info.
---
I've run into more good people than bad so far, let's hope it keeps up.
---
Never got fixed properly.
---
You are literally neglecting the points I made.
---
Do I expect games to be perfect at launch. NO. Never said I did. Did I say I hate this game. NO. I love it, because I love fallout. Am I upset that Bethesda has sold me fallout 4 assets once again. YES, of course I am otherwise I'd be an idiot. Would I buy it again. YES. Because I love their game formula and I'm a sucker.
---
They did some great new things with this game. Making interesting environments and biomes, new weapons, new stuff. But to neglect the fact that they didn't need to create this game from scratch, that they ported over alot of things (including bugs) from the previous game, that there were many game breaking bugs in the beginning, that there were things massively ruining the game (exploits) and they choose to take 2-4 weeks fix them (and didn't even fix it properly so it was another 2-4 weeks), that because this is their first online game (for some reason ESO doesn't count) that means they get a free pass and forget you payed the price of an expensive AAA title?
---
I think people slamming this title unfairly because you're entitled and it's not exactly what you wanted is very wrong and has very dangerous impact on the company, but so is defending and accepting the mistakes they make because you're a fan. That only creates stigma that it's ok for them to treat the customers and product in a certain way.
---
I love this game, I've already somehow sunk more than 100 hours into it. I will continue to play it.
---
But I will also acknowledge it's flaws because that's important too.  There must always be a balance
---
It shouldn't have released in the state that it did. Keep thanking a company that lied to you and sold you a broken product. 
---
[Here ya go.](https://youtu.be/aqMYBJqC8y4)
---
It doesn't kill 4 scorched. It kills **three** before the gun loses a fourth of its fucking condition. Its somehow worse than my exaggeration.
---
Hopefully by now you realize these guns are a dumpster fire of a weapon.
---
Now they just need to make the weapons more appealing and we shall see lasers everywhere!.
---
Would be better if they listed the armor on it though, like if it's a full set (I like to match, sue me) and then put like 'peicemeal power armor' for mix/matched sets, would reduce the needed metadate for the names (custom names would cause issues when you've got hundreds of thousands, if not millions of items getting that treatment) and this would make for a good 'middle ground' solution imo
---
Fuck this goddamned bot. Title is descriptive enough
---
I like that 90% of the people you run in to wave at you and just continue on their way or play with you
---
Maybe the wirea to long or clipping something?
---
yep what I was thinking wanted the duping to be totally fixed before they release the 4 and 5 star gear.  We might not see those for a while till they feel duping is finally gone for good.
---
Actually you need less Balistic Fiber, they raised the starting level cap when fiber is needed by 5 levels, then reduced mat costs across the board by roughly 20%
---
CAPS ISNT NECESSARILY YELLING. ITS JUST A BIGGER FONT TO USE. IT DOES MAKE SOME FEEL MORE IMPORTANT THOUGH.
---
There absolutely are, but most people wouldn’t budget for them until late game as the use cases are pretty limited
---
Red wire should only mean something is in its way between the two points. If thats not the case scrap it and build another and see if it presists.
---
If that keeps going on submit a ticket to support.
---
Ikr? Troll post.
---
I am probably one of the few that have the aquaman perk just to go dumpster diving in lakes lol
---
It's 100% workable for like a week, after which point the dupers will simply use a mule account to trade items piecemeal.
---
Unless Bethesda **actively monitors inventories and stashes during every play session**, which has yet to be even proven possible, then people will find a way around the safety measures. 
---
The fact that they've done absolutely nothing for months is quite telling. No developer or publisher in their right mind would allow cheating of this magnitude, especially considering they've already banned people for other kinds of cheats (that they can actually detect) such as .dll injectors.
---
I have a Bloodied 2-star auto that does +50% limb damage, so in this case, it's worth it &gt;.&gt;
---
IN general, if you have the weight to spare, try it just to try it on something low risk to see how it works. It really spams out grenades at an alarming weight.
---
Word to the wise: start by aiming too far. You will easily annihilate yourself if you shoot the ground too close.
---
I made 3 nuke trips to white springs to see what it was all about. Every time I went there were a whole bunch of players levels 5-40 there kiting mobs to the robots.
---
The robots essentially did all the work while the cheaters gained the experience and levelled up super fast. They also did this with Legendaries as well. 
---
&gt;  know this sounds stupid but who knows if it’s a new player to the game or a duper 🤷🏻‍♀️ 
---
Well thats the idea of only allowing new characters created after version (BLAH)  on the new servers.  No one can join with a character that has any legacy dupes or anything at all it would basically be back to the beta days of everyone starting fresh
---
The only real way would be if more exploits come out and they start again or save game editing becomes a thing
---
Their work isn't thankless if you're thanking them. They aren't saints for fixing a game that was marketed as something else entirely. These type of posts are really frustrating. You do understand that right now their game is bad because it was rushed out and Bethesda flat out lied to many of their consumers. They used the good name of the fallout series as a cash grab and them fixing the game isn't something that should be praised every time they fix 1 of the 10000 bugs. Especially when they keep adding more like with the nuke bug. Its something that should be expected in triple A games. The only reason they are fixing it is they don't want their name to be further dragged in the mud. I don't think the players who had spent 100+ hours on their character for it to be wiped are thanking Bethesda for fixing anything. The fact that was possible to begin with shows how rushed out this was. 
---
To make matters worse you're saying thanks for "listening to us"?
---
Who asked for this 
---
- Power Armor: The Power Armor light has been made brighter.
---
- Crafting: Lowered chance of Power Generators of spawning fusion cores.
---
- Weapons: Legendary Hunting Rifles will now drop as loot.
---
- Mirelurk Eggs: Harvesting Mirelurk Eggs will not result in two separate eggs.
---
Meanwhile to craft 5 (Base stat without perks. 9 max with perks since its unaffected by chemist) flamer shots at the chemist station it takes nearly 20 pieces of scrap (10 acid, 5 oil, and 2 steel) making the flamer essentially unusable. Even though it has its own perk (friendly fire) which might actually be interesting. Since flamer ammo is rare to find without server hopping getting your hands on it is really hard. If you've ever shot a flamer you'd understand how quickly you go through 5 shots. This has been an issue since launch and Bethesda still hasn't addressed it. 
---
I'm not going to deny the fact Bethesda has changed a lot of things since the game was initially released in the abysmal state it was and still is. Just their still very tone death when it comes to actually listening to what players want. Flat out banning players for using QOL mods like Better Inventory or Quick Swap Perks. Both great mods that I'd personally highly recommend and I don't understand why they aren't just implemented to the game to begin with considering how quickly modders made them on release. Being able to quick swap perks and understanding how much items weigh together makes the game so much better. They should be working with these modders making them addons like WoW has rather than banning players who use them. 
---
People need to stop thanking Bethesda till we get the game that we were actually promised. If Bethesda starts to think that the game's current state right now is acceptable on any terms what can we expect from Starfield or the new Elder Scrolls? More "atom shop" content? I totally want to pay 4 dollars to essentially paint my mini gun black while I'm killing the scorched queen for the 1000th time or blasting the 1000000th ghoul. I know tons of players who've put a bit over 200 hours into 76 and have just stopped playing. Not even playing for the social aspect of the game. My friends list is a ghost town right now. 200 hours for a person who plays video games all the time is like a couple weeks at best. Those 200 hours weren't even memorable for most. You want more of that in Bethesda games? While fallout 4 wasn't the best fallout it at least had lots of memorable moments. After the first nuke in 76 the rest just get boring and become a grind.
---
Bethesda needs to implement actual PvP like they promised in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le5mUm6uUrM
---
Bethesda needs to add actual quests instead of fetch quests. 
---
Bethesda needs to actually listen to their players. Instead of doing things like this.
---
Bethesda doesn't need to be thanked.
---
Go ahead and down vote me Bethesda bots.
---
Ikr? Imagine what theyve got cooked up that they are not showing you.
---
Lol are you a piece of shit irl too or too chicken shit to say that to anybody in your daily life???
---
Sounds like a good way to get people to flag themselves. Build a base at Whitespring?
---
Ungrateful? You know the game costs money right?
---
Wow, seriously?  I like wacky but this is simply wack.  That Playskool PA skin is rude as hell.
---
Go do “Parol Duty” at the prison a few times.  Did it twice at level 60ish.  Took all of 30 minutes to get the handmade plan
---
I'd say it's shitty players like you that dismiss claims about griefing that cause people to stop playing this game. I'm sickened by your actions as it stands.
---
There's currently no way to earn or grind to get those weapons.
---
In FO4 you could do exactly that, grind to your perfect build.
---
If they would let us LOCK weapons in our inventory (so they couldn't be scrapped, sold, dropped, or traded) and we could SCRAP unlocked legendary weapons with a 5% chance to pull a legendary effect off.  I'd definitely take the high road and grind for it.  I don't mind working towards my build.
---
But with a 1 in 1,000,000 chance of getting a TSE anything, or a Super Sledge Bloody / Swing Speed / +1 strength....no thanks.  That's why the black market exists.
---
Just a FYI if they allowed that, it would severely screw over dupers and people selling items for real money.  Why go to the black market when you can just make your own?
---
Company puts out broken game. Player abuse broken mechanics. You want multi billion dollar company to abuse the system to punish people who abused their broken code. 
---
Amazing. The next logical step forward is to take Mr Todd on a date.
---
Characters that attempt to load into a game with massively excessive inventories should not be able to and greeted with a message asking them to contact Bethesda support.
---
I can understand from both sides on the 'fuel' bit, I'm playing a chef character, nothing says 'chef gun' imo than a flamer (cook that mirelurk you bastards) and getting only 5 (or 8 with ammo craft perk) ammo for it for 10 oil and 10 acid is a bit absurd with how fast the ammo is used up on it.
---
Honestly, instead of them 'increasing' the fuel gained by this, I'd much rather them make Fuel work like fusion/plasma cores, after all, since you need steel to make the 'fuel' your basically making a small tank of it, and then the 'capacity' mods for flamers could work by decreasing the rate at which your 'fuel tank' is consumed (better/more efficient hoses/valves, meaning less waste or w/e I guess)
---
Also fun tip just in case you don't know already, if you're worried about it getting destroyed and it costing a lot to repair, you can just store it and when you place it again it'll be intact 👍
---
That's not entitlement, don't use words you don't understand. 
---
Red wire means it's either too far away or it's going through something.
---
Trapper is rare, and....it's actually getting closer to being on par with BoS combat armor now for me (a hardened Trapper Chest grants 45 all res, totals out to 135 total res value) 
---
Question OP: do you run a custom.ini?
---
Everyone has suffered because of these duping fools.
---
Our servers crash, lag is commonplace, vendors are loaded with shit, etc.
---
So what's the difference if we ALL have to be knocked down a peg?
---
I don't have anything I can't afford to lose in-game, and if I did, i personally don't mind if it can guarantee me some stability and extended play time without servers shitting the bed.
---
Indeed, this post
---
How much you willing to pay
---
I am 120 
---
a kind stranger gave me a tse bolt action pipe rifle at the whitesprings golf course when i was around level 70. is it duped? idk its not an over powered gun compared to a tse shotgun or a minigun but its my ugly baby and It gets the work dome
---
Why does them using fo4 assets matter at all?  I really don’t understand?  And there was 1 or 2 game breaking bugs I believe, not many? And they got fixed in the first patch or two? 
---
And duping (as I cant really think of any other major exploit you could be talking about) is an incredibly difficult thing to get rid of in games.  Look at GTA for example.  It’s not something they can just hotfix in five minutes and then laugh about how easy it was.   And please don’t forget the timing of the release either,  they released right around some major holidays and are entitled to have their holiday time just as much as we are.
---
I’m down to admit the game has flaws, never said it didn’t.  I’ve actually said launch had its issues iirc.   But over exaggerating and making claims like “they advertised this and didn’t put it in, they lied to us and aren’t giving me what I paid for” is plain sad. 
---
1000 caps?
---
&gt;I don’t see them claiming 16x more detail anyway in there, friend?
---
You don't see Tod Howarwd Claiming 16X more detail in Fallout  76?
---
I take it you didn't watch the E3 Presentation for this game?
---
Here you go 
---

---
If you think the graphics problems this game has is fine that's ok, I'm not bothered by buildings literally not loading in Whitesping, Harpers Ferry having buildings that are literally 8-bit polygons until you server hop and they load in. 
---
i don't play FO for the graphics but you'd have to be high to think this is 16x FO4 
---
Atomic shop
---
Just saying
---
Apparently it was...who knows. Must have been bad feng shui, being on an upper floor. Moved it a floor lower and it worked. Because of course!
---
Yeah, there should be a max to the number of caps you lose for 1 PVP death.
---
I trade heavily and can afford it, but most people just playing the game and hitting the vendors can't.
---
You must be lucky. I've played 200 hours and found no TSE, no explosive and one two-shot (single action revolver). 
---
Thanks for using the right format in your title. 
---
Yeah, the big dif here though is that this is buggy due to 'first time with this studio making an online game' and using an engine designed for single player titles.  (bsg =/= bsw =/= zenimax) where as Andromeda was just....laughable at best
---
Those eyes man, those fuckin' eyes!
---
You provide the materials done. Got 29 intelligence
---
Player vendor stations was in the no clip documentary.
---
Along with them discussing the Mothman storyline. Where he would originally stalk you, and you'd meet at different stages till you fight him.
---
The documentary as well as the trailers showed many more camp assets
---
The launch, Todd Howard's exact words were "16 times the detail"
---
No clip documentary. Talks about the new cranberry bog as parts as a large cranberry Forrest with man eating plant enemies.
---
and here i am chasing a 3* super mutant through the woods while he screams run away then he drops a 1* hunters wooden arm 
---
Nice, it was probably all duped anyways.  Glad you took it from him...lol
---
I did it close to the games release. I tend to just attract the ghouls to the stairs where turrets can't get them 
---
You're absolutely wrong. Certain guns don't have special animations for the number of shells, and in those cases you're right. But that's not how all guns function and some guns reload each bullet individually. Like I said, I have quad weapons that do this and they reloaded each bullet you shot, not just the original amount. I also have a double flamer and quad cryolator that has the same reload animation but my pump action quad takes forever to load.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/acyanc/my_first_legendary_explosive_weapon_drop_yes_quad/ here's someone else who is experiencing the same thing since you can't seem to wrap your head around it and voted me down for some unknown reason. The ammo capacity is directly related to the reload animation and that's what we're talking about. You, for some reason brought up something else totally unrelated and convinced yourself that they're similar.
---
Bro I was making a mild reference to apartheid. Truth and reconciliation, Nelson Mandela and the like.  No need to get all triggered. personally I think all stash boxes should be brought down to 600 manually, deleting all excess weight from duping and stash box glitching. But banning people for exploiting a game that could widely be considered in beta still is a little overboard. This game is supposed to continue for 10+ years. The first months of online games need to bring out the exploits. It makes the game better in the long run. 
---
I dine hans the materials sorry
---
I love my ultracite laser. The green bean alone does it for me.
---
But I would use an anti-armor automatic Tesla’s rifle at whitesprings (pacifist on) and would try not to kill enemies with it just cause of this. Good way to burn excess cells. Just wish the mag was bigger than 15. 
---
Holy crap.
---
2k then
---
Please don’t be silly and expect me to watch a 30min video to find a small quote that’s in there.
---
And “16x detail” certainly doesn’t translate to “graphics will be 16x better”  
---
Hey I'll be using my lasers more now, most things actually have quite low energy resistance so it works like having a higher damage output tbh....
---
Now why can't I get an instigating, two shot, 6 crank laser musket to turn into my One Hit Wonderbus again
---
It has been like this since release but it still accomplishes the goal for the most part. If you die from slap damage from another player then you probably should have.
---
I feel like battlefield is different in 2 ways - 1. The developer really, REALLY dropped the ball with the community. Bad. By telling people not to buy the game. And 2. They really changed the core gameplay to make it feel somewhat more like CoD, a trend that started with BF1. Granted, if you like that style then that’s awesome. I just feel like 76, while having no NPCs, is Fallout at its core while Battlefield V is battlefield in name-only. Glad to see someone enjoying it at least :(
---
Sorry I don’t have 2k thanks though 
---
Lure Weeds grow at the edge of ponds/ rivers, I see them in The Forest a lot
---
Make deathclaws the apex predator again.  Screw scorchbeasts.  They're just dicks.
---
Stupid is as stupid does. Good point. 
---
Provide your sources man.  Again, continuing to claim this and that doesn’t mean shit if you don’t provide your sources.  And for the love of god don’t give me a link to a long ass video expecting me to find your source for you. 
---
The raider vendor at pleasent valley ski resort also sells it
---
You’re fine at the munitions plant. I’ve had it happen several times, and I just hole up inside. It’s like having 3 really big, really annoying guards. No one wants to fuck with your base with 3 Scorchbeasts on them. 
---
Dont worry, I may run into a lot of legendaries, and my fair share of RadStag behavior running away ones. But yeah always shit loot, too many damn Death Tambos for me, i dont even melee.
---
No. They think they shipped a product early, for a bunch of reasons that make sense long term, but force you to take an early popularity hit. 
---
They did it understanding it, and shouldered the years-long) effort needed to ride it out. 
---
I don’t think they’re emotionally attached to our gratitude, just to our enjoying the game and continuing to want to be a part of it. 
---
I had some jackass beat on me for a good 15 minutes while I had pacifist mode on. I baited him inside the bus in front of Whitesprings and he ended up destroying it, damaging all the nearby robots, and aggroing them on himself.
---
It's fun to sat and watch him break his weapons on you while robots kill him.
---
I find a lot of my wires do not connect directly from point to point when involving the through the wall conduits and some of the other connectors.   I know this sounds confusing so I'll try to explain further.    For some reason I often cannot get the wires to connect directly on the contact point, nothing but red.   If I drag the line near the connection point by just moving the wire in the vicinity (small circular motions around the connector) of the connection I can get the connection to go green even though on screen the end is no where near the actual connection point.     Often I see the quick flash of green and have to narrow down the exact spot the wire snaps to the connector.   
---
Sounds weird but it works.
---
Considering how much damage potential it has for using a 'basic' ammo type, I've no problems with the small mag capacity, but that's me
---
Whoa Black Betty, Armor Lamps
---
Here's my base by the way. Premium location for making Cranberry Relish.
---
Don't steal my spot ok!
---
[https://streamable.com/xsj1x](https://streamable.com/xsj1x)
---
Agree!
---
The first time I saw that come down I was like "oh boy, here comes some sweet lootz".
---
Opened it up, 1 med-x, 1 dog food, and toilet paper (money).
---
Apparently they think I should eat the dog food, take the med-x, and when I get the runs there's 30 pre-war dollars to wipe my butt with.....lol
---
On a side note I've been running no food perks except Good Doggy and no water perks except for having 3 of the 2 slot purifiers at my base.  Never going back to any other food.  Dog food and purified water FTW :)
---
I DID AN OOPSIE AND TODD HOWARD BURST INTO MY ROOM ALL OILED UP AND CHOPPED MY PEE PEE OFF AND CALLED ME A NAUGHTY BOY THEN HE LEANED IN AND WHISPERED IN MY EAR IT JUST WORKS
---
You inspired me. 
---
Same here, I’ve had a lot of great interactions, and I’m sure I’ll have more. Just really hate to see this type of behavior allowed.
---
Or a new mini workstation that specifically can be used to craft screws or springs.
---
Your first comment generalized everybody who wants mores stash as having poor impulse control.
---
“Exactly this. The people who are balling their eyes out because of a stash size of 600 will run into the same issues because they never learned how to deal with it when it was smaller.”
---
I listed completely different reasons for why people like me want it increased.
---
Instead of actually addressing those reasons you instead ask a loaded question to which no matter what I answer, you’ll just say I’ll want more once I have it.
---
A convenient way to totally ignore everything I said.
---
Again, I don’t need to know whatever magic number is “right” for the game’s stash limit to know the current one is too small for many of us. 
---
If I can’t even store half the weapon and armor options for my build, without perks, the game has too little storage. Period.
---
Without those perks I’d need to make a new character with the exact same build just to enjoy a few other applicable guns.
---
And that’s not getting into player shops, they’ll need more storage for that reason as well.
---
350/200 on my person. Maxed out with stash box at 600/600. The thing is, I was able to get really lucky with some crazy legendary weapons and armor early enough in the game where I'm just holding them when my time comes. They take up so much space. I'm only Level 22 btw. 
---
Idk man, I dont speak German or use discord so probably not much help. But looking at google and your transcript, there's a twitter account by your ign that has the name he said in the opening, haute
---
Just two words
---
Stash
---
Dupe
---
It worked with 2 BPRs yesterday. I love this game xD
---
See my post below.  That's what we get in FO76.
---
Duped items cant be traced.
---
But most dupers aren't very smart, they carry 5000 items around with them. It's fairly obvious that these idiots just get the banhammer.
---
The sneaky ones, well they're few and far between, they stash items. But guess what, they'll get lazy.
---
We just removed an entire marketplace of duped stuff, they'll be loving it, sellong their wares at crazy prices,  "damn, I'm killing it this week".
---
Nek minnit, they're carrying 2000 nuka quantums and 400 shotguns...
---
Rinse, repeat step one.
---
Nah it was never gone, Every time I move my camp I have a double of everything. Have to salvage one before I can build lol. 
---
I don't think we should say that they would have delayed it, because we don't know. In my opinion, at least, I can honestly say the map and enemies are top notch. They really out did themselves on these 2 parts. But that's where they probably put all their resources. Not bugtesting, not adding more quests, not adding NPC'S and a lot of other things.
---
It sits on a sweet spot between the hunting rifle's long reload and, say, a non-automatic handmade's rate of fire.  I've never used it with a scope, but I've used both a hunting rifle and a lever action with a reflex sight and the lever action has a better feel.
---
r/FO76:
---
&gt;Force trading isn't a real glitch! There's not proof!!
---
Bethesda:
---
&gt;Trade: Fixed an issue where players could view another player’s inventory before they can respond to a trade invite.
---
&gt;Trade: We no longer let trades occur before the requested player has consented to trade.
---
You can’t currently :(
---
same with me, its awful. its like every scope i use is 100x zoom. no difference between short and long scope besides cross hair. surprised there aren't any other posts about this
---
Really aren't that rare found plenty ar camp mc'clintock but ty for the info but I'm sure they aren't going to leave the marine recon helmet out for long considering the assests or already there just not obtainable rn. 
---
There's a lot that needs changing, I'm getting tired of getting crippled then from explosive rounds then  basically dying. And it doesn't help that explosive heavy weapons get almost a 200% damage boost 
---
I can’t even do barely any daily quests. Only was able to do Heart of the Enemy and the Campden Park dailies once, any time I go back it’s never worked again. :(
---
How did we all know? The guy I bought my TSE from only had the one TSE in his inventory, no super large number of anything else except ammo and I had more ammo than he did, that's why I bought the gun! 
---
Now maybe he was just a very considerate duper who RPd someone legitimate but from screenshots I have seen the dupers tend to have hundreds of extra items. But who knows maybe the gun was duped. There is literally no way of knowing.
---
Quite honestly I wouldn't mind seeing a reduction in the two shot AND explosive legendary tags, maybe one or the other, mostly because TSE is Meh. I'm actually sorry I sold my 1 shot explosive. It was a better gun. My TSE is so inaccurate I've blown myself up when trying to snipe over a hill. 
---
No need to avoid the event like a disease. There's a very easy security-step: before you insert the first item, you switch the category from "All inventory" to the the one, which only shows the ingredients (don't know the english name for it). So on console, just press the right shoulder twice (maybe 3x, not sure). that's it. be safe.
---
Yea but bethesda still cant ban without more proof. And ive rarely come across people who have crazy high amounts of items and the ones i have were from me killing them and taking their junk. Should i be banned if i fairly loot 1000 springs off of a player just because i have an outrageous amount of an item? There are just alot of circumstances where players could be banned despite being innocent. Also the sheer man power needed to carry out the bans you are taking about is impossible 
---
Yeah I know what you mean, but after awhile of doing the same type of playing the game you want to change how you play and it gets very tedious and time consuming.
---
There's a weird group of people here that are on some weird vindictive justice high. It's feverish bullshit at this point. 
---
I don't get gaming social media anymore.
---
You totally need it to point to a shitter.
---
If you ask for a Source don't bitch when people provide you one because you are lazy

16x the Detail  translates to saying literal 2-D Flowers lmao what a world.
---
Next time follow them and sit close to them and jump in front of their bullets so they can suicide themselves point blank with their own explosion. Asking nice only goes so far.
---
Right?  I still want to see more than the same skins on every player,  over and over.  Something more accessible than the atomic shop would be primo.  Most of all, I'd like the ability to build and add creative parts to the raider style PA, similar to the way Fo4: Automatron treated robot building and design.
---
If you see the server not responding, check for dupers somewhere (2 people alone in the middle of nowhere).  I don't know how it's done, but it involves something that lags the server like crazy.
---
It's a personal mission of mine to go find some dupers and steal their stuff.
---
I ALMOST accomplished it the other day.  Saw the message "server not responding" and started looking.  Saw one super high level and one low level player at the shack near Vault 76.........hmmmm, why would 2 players be hanging out at a dumb shack with no loot and 3 enemies?  Went over there, sure enough I heard them talking about how if they do this too much it will crash the server.  Got spotted before I could get close enough.
---
I will find you, and I will steal your duped loots, and I will laugh my balls off after.
---
At least Bethesda makes sense. They want to make money. I dont understand circlejerking them for doing what should have been done from the beginning.
---
There is something kinda like this already. Normal Scorched in the Petrified Corpse poses. You get close they start moving.
---
Yeah I feel u. My small shifting has now locked me with "essential" cards I won't swap out but I can feel that hurting me 
---
[There was million posts about it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=feed%20people&amp;restrict_sr=1)
---
Excellent point. It goes like the old addage:
---
You make something idiotproof, there's always a better idiot...
---
I tried blocking shots, as I’ve heard that tip before. Doesn’t work in reality though, atleast not with these dudes. They would sit back, fire once/twice and then collect. No time to get in their face. I would have to be invisible and and really quick. The dude did kill himself right before the crash, which may have been on purpose? He shot a car, point blank. 
---
I'm level 39 and can't help myself but to do the event 'Leader of the Pack' every time I see it.  3 legendary pieces guaranteed, none of which I'll likely ever use.  They're barely worth more than basics from a vendor, so I drop them in the church cache in Flatwoods.  I hope people are finding them and getting a headstart on the the low levels.
---
None of them are friendly for me, but they never attack and i can fast travel around them.
---
A 30min video for 4 words is not a source.  It’s not my job to find your source for you.  
---
And if you honestly think that just because it has 2-D flowers, it negates all the rest of the good and detail they put in the game, then I don’t really see how it’s worth arguing with you as I personally find that utterly ridiculous. 
---
Tried this, didn’t work. He shot once and killed the whole mob. Didn’t get a chance to get in front.
---
I’ve lived in WV for most of my life. In a few different settings as well, City, country, middle of nowhere. For me, the game really captures the feel of the state. It just “feels” like I’ve been there. Given I haven’t visited a lot of the places in the game, and my home city (Parkersburg) isn’t in the game. The sounds are spot on. The different owls, frogs, ect. That was the thing I told a lot of people who knew I was playing it and weren’t necessarily gamers, but curious. That the game captured the ambiance perfectly. 
---
Now their is a million and one, which is why I made the post. You shouldn't have to research all the possible bugs you can encounter in a game.
---
Or people who bought guns before duping became so wide spread. Or people who bought in good faith. Not everyone bought from the level 7 with 10 of each TSE and 100k serums.
---
But hey, fuckem, right?
---
Kind of funny we spend so much time on faces and hairstyles.  Then cover them with helmets, masks and power armor. 
---
I think I noticed it reloading faster whilst in combat. I think they've broken it a little...
---
Was that a thing?
---
Around 19 I think
---
They have 2 options block for session and straight up block! I'm quick to block trolls, the pvp trolls that steal bags are the problem! One guy literally got on mic and goes "I stole your bag boyyy, sorry kid I took it all" with a Jersey shore ancient LOL yeah boyyyy!!!! I thought it was hilarious but what a little shit head! Some people get really upset when their junk gets stolen. 
---
So what? Not like they are doing anything about it, too busy pouring out overpriced cash shop items to care.
---
&gt;It’s not my job to find your source for you.
---
Holy fuck **You are the one who asked me for a source and i was nice enough to give you one instead of telling you it's not my job to find your source for you**
---
Utterly Ridiculous fanboy
---
Grammar Nazi, yet you can't be bothered to use proper spelling, capitalisation, or punctuation? That's brilliant! 😂
---
Unique PA is all I ever wanted. A WV themed armor would be great.  If I had the freedom to customize my current PA, I'd probably put a bear skull on it along with a bear skin cowl over the shoulder and a torn WV state flag around the waistline.
---
All very good counter points.
---
I'd be pissed too if I was banned cos I farmed *enough* screws and springs to finish my excavator armour.
---
Manpower is a great point. Unfortunately, the sheer amount of these fools outweighs the staff requirement to oversee such an undertaking.
---
*Damn, I thought I'd found the formula for world peace...* haha
---
No? Bro game breaking bugs aren't alright. 
---
Which sounds great if they do. So long as they have actually fixed duping. 
---
The robots are super weak I doubt it. 
---
They toke a lot of the freedom we use to have with fallout 4 with having most of the perks at all the time and yes I love the older games and the way they are played but with this respecing system they know the game will change often and make most builds absolutely in some patches. Like my sniper build does as much damage as some guy running up to a deathclaw and one shotting it .
---
Been like that since the beta. 
---
i mean its yet to be decided if they ACTUALLY accomplished anything,but yes it is incredible that they are even making the effort to make it look like they are.
---
I didn't get a pack at 30...
---
Thrn we should really sugest to Bethesda to nerf explosive shotguns to onlg do 1 explosion damage shared equally between all pallets. I don't think every pallet having s separated full damage explosion was intended. Bethesda just needs to lower the damage of the explosion by the number of pallets a shotgun shoots.
---
Yea its unfortunate that the game economy has been completely ruined and that alot of players are significantly more advantaged but the damage has been done and it cant be fixed anymore so we might as well let bethesda focus on bug fixes and bringing us new content to enjoy. 
---
Well and good stopping them. But you're part of the problem if you're using duped things
---
How am I supposed to know if something is duped?
---
You were unpaid beta testers who instead had to pay them $60. Then they used your data to fix the game. Honestly, if you wanna thank them after that, you're a lost,  confused soul and I pity you. 
---
Again, since you apparently can’t read properly, a 30min video is not a source for a 4 word quote. .  So yes, you did finally provide a “source” with the second link and I don’t believe I stated you didn’t?
---
Seems like you’re just set on being a salty lil child and anyone who disagrees with you is obviously just a fanboy.  How pathetic. 
---
&gt; How about the fact its a larger world than F4, the terrain is of much higher detail, cells are packed with a lot more entities, etc. etc.
---
Wow it's almost like my post wasn't about all the things I love about the game.
---
BethesdaDefenseForce lmao 
---
I don't have a million items either but I have items I traded for that Im 99% sure are duped. Back before duping wasn't wide known, just a explosive shotgun would go 60k caps plus. Unless you paid that for one, I wouldn't be upset. 
---
I know what you mean with accuracy, I prefer bloody explosive 
---
First thing you always do in a Bethesda game is to horde rare materials for crafting.
---
Unless the legendaries are three star or TSE you should just sell them. You have plenty of time to find stuff. Being overencumbered already at such a low level kinda sucks, its only going to get worse. 
---
You have a really bad way of looking at it. Y'all are saying people are wrong for saying the game suck if they have not played it, but they are also wrong if they played it to a high level? That's just stupid
---
I've been seeing between 220 and 270 XP on my level 305 character... So think half 
---
I really hope you don't give people advice on this account. Don't think you really understand the weight you should give certain things you find offensive.
---
Get over yourself.
---
I just did a quick Google and found out the one I posted is in Fallout 4 as well (didn't play much of FO4). I thought it was a new model for the one OP posted!
---
I hope you're right in that the other one becomes obtainable at some point, it's a nice looking helmet. 
---
yeah BUT..... the LAR isn't exactly a pea-shooter, 20 rounds at a time will do some serious work.
---
*and if it's too tedious to reload for that long, just bust out a black-powder rifle!*
---
Nothing yet very glad the focus is on bug fixing though. Just hoping they take their time with vaults so they are not buggy as hell on release.
---
Place the roof on after attaching the wire, (or next floor) solves it every time.
---
Alternatively, place a horizontal power connector below the power connector and connect them together, feeding off the secondary connection
---
Same issue with Water Purifier taking up my budge space and unable to scrap or delete it.  Still no fixes.  Is there a way to report bugs?  
---
Their “red” status doesn’t change but they stop attacking you.
---
I have the lone wonder perk card that grants you more XP when you are alone and not in a group . 
---
Idk if your on pc and have that perk card . 
---
But if you do , are you getting them XP? 
---
I'm not convinced stacking bobbleheads works. I've tried stacking them as that post specified (just threw on 2x strength, 3x int, and 2x energy weapons) and it doesn't work. Bobblehead refresh works, but I don't think the stacking does. 
---
Seems like it's bogus to me
---
Here. Mostly in the evening hours.
---
IGN: Xschtief 
---
Figured it out thanks, now to be able survive down there. Thanks though
---
but your opinion isnt the only one that matter so whether or not you'd be upset is irrelevant 
---
Boo you queen of filth

So blazing it is no longer a valid strategy?

---
Another thread I read yesterday had some excellent ideas.
---
Spawning location dependant "bosses" and particular mobs. Ie: Grafton gets a nuke, so the Grafton monster is 40ft tall and irradiates AND poisons everything within hitting distance, etc.
---
We as a community provide LOTS of ideas and such, and Bethasda could satisfy a lot of our hungers for content with some of them.
---
I look forward to the next 12 months of 76, let's hope it goes well :)
---
Please pardon the dumb question... but anyone got a link to what was/is being fixed in this patch?
---
Yeah, you gonna review the game, you need to spend real time in the game, not a couple hours either. Play it for 10 days or something. Asking people their thoughts and opinions isnt really you reviewing it. 
---
Seems all Scorch beasts are
---
Ladies and gentlemen, we got em.
---
It’s moving points around that’s the big problem.  If you want to have a heavy build and a sniper build, buying the cards for the spec is a one time deal even though it costs a lot of points.  But to change specials you have to get like 25 levels to change points from perception to strength, or however your build is.  A respec becomes a week long process every time.  Not exactly fun.  
---
I don't even pick them up and have actually dropped a few.  How is anyone able to stash them when they weigh 3? each?
---
Ok homie if you want detailed response here it goes - entirely separated servers. 
---
Exactly. That whole post warning about stacking bobbleheads was alarmist bullshit. It's stupid we demand proof for force trading (which they actually PATCHED today) but we go without any real corroboration that stack bobbleheads is real.
---
Because as it stands you can be very easily and readily 1-shot by people, it's not really fair. It's like... okay, imagine pvp as a home invasion. 
---
You have two options in this home invasion, you can either sit still and watch someone steal from you / sit still and let them beat you to death, or you can stand up and hit punch them only for them to suddenly pull out a gun and shoot you in the face. 
---
You had a gun too, but you weren't able to pull it out since you had to wait for them to pull out their gun. 
---
To punish them the game puts a bounty on them oooonly... they can just have a friend come up, kill them, and hand back over their stuff. The only people that win in this shit are the aggressors. 
---
The change notes are so detailed. That's what I wanted to see. I've put off the game until it was updated. It's looking damn good. 
---
I need to figure out how to make the bright parts make less of that horizontal blur/glowy stuff that looks like you're looking at lights through wet eyes. Like any bright light source does this horizontal blur thing, it messes with my eyes. 
---
I love it when a plan comes together.
---
&gt; To make matters worse you're saying thanks for "listening to us"? Who asked for this   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; Weapons: Legendary Hunting Rifles will now drop as loot 
---
Pretty much everyone who uses a semi-auto build asked for this. A ton of people made entire threads about this issue. Like... many, many threads.
---
&gt; you actually believe this 
---
I know it, Ive looked at the data, the spacing between each vertex is twice as small as F4, while at the same time each "block" of terrain is twice as dense. Coupled with the fact that the terrain is now rendered using tessellation, this gives alot more triangle density where required, thus u much higher detailed terrain.  (Again when comparing to the older games, not other games outside of the Bethesda world)
---
So you dont have to believe me, these are just pure facts. As was the rest of my post. You simply stated they lied about the detail, and im telling you they are not lying, just because you can't visually tell, doesnt make it less true.
---
A great many of them are scorched: mindless drones muttering and echoing the same hive-mind inspired drivel, barely even aware of their own existance.
---
I agree, more bosses more dungeons higher star legendary enemies and continued support will keep the games longevity. I honestly get why players dupe though. The sheer amount of frustration from rng legendary drops probably would have pushed me to do it if i hadnt had enough caps to buy TSE weapons from players. If enemies werent as bulletspongy and if i disnt participate in pvp i honestly wouldnt care if i couldnt one shot everything. But that combined with players having them too just makes them a high lvl necessity if you want to enjoy the game for londg periods of time and that sucks
---
I loaded in and had 6 Artillery, 3 Industrial Purifiers, 74 corn, 60 tatos, and 22 mutfruit.  None of that was stored before the patch.  I was way over budget even after scrapping everything stored.  Server hop seemed to fix it.
---
Yeah. With my character it puts the price from 31 caps per costume to 50. So only need to sell 4 to a vendor instead of 6. so for the vendor route I do daily I only need to make 24 outfits where if I didn't use the mentats I'd have to make 36 outfits and still not make quite as much. 50 per outfit is good being a rounf number where at 31 caps per outfit you can only sell 6 and the vendor would still have some caps left.
---
You can get the plan for lever rifles at any lower level vendor (I got mine at Camden Park) 
---
Console bans, most people have dynamic IPs that can be flushed by power cycling a modem or calling their ISP
---
No one has recently mentioned the plan for the witch hat.  I found both costumes and  hat plans on her Body.  Yes it took me 2 days of server hoping 2 hours each but both plans exist
---
i would lol
---
This does indeed work: I got the plans from that event at level 97 earlier this week, on my fourth try. (Just run from spawn point to the front door; if that doesn't trigger an event, or if it triggers the Prison Break event instead of the Patrol Duty event, just quit out and try another server.)
---
The bugs should have been fixed by now either way.  But the game just sucks and desperately needs gameplay improvements more than anything.
---
And you sound like a prickly with that "you sound like' comment.  Remember this place is for constructive conversation not gatekeeping and putting people with other opinions down.  I'm surprised at the negativity lately.
---
Yes, it completely heals you in 5-10 seconds once combat ends (minus any rads you have).
---
If you ever do the crouch to see if you're in Caution or Danger...........your healing factor will not activate if there's even 1 enemy nearby that's in caution or danger status.  So you can tell you haven't cleared everything while you're sprinting....lol
---
Make sure you have class freak and starched genes.............but yes, healing factor rocks.
---
I do agree that this sub can at times be overly protective of fo76 but I think that's largely in response to how negative r/Fallout has become. For the most part genuine criticism of this game has been largely well-received here, in my experience, provided you support your critiques with evidence, be it actual data or anecdotal.
---
Thanks for the post! 
---
Cranberries can also be found in those weird groves all around cranberry bog, and there are many.  
---
In the forest area, river Bank, there is a house where where some enemies spawn, more notable mention may be dead kid under a desk holding a toy car. Near this house are several planters, one for ash rose and one for ginseng. I only know this because friend built his camp nearby
---
Thanks
---
Thank heavens!
---
See guys they are listening!  Bobby pins got a weight reduction as well :)
---
I don't really have time to keep doing these back and forths, so I'll try to just be quick points.
---
It does matter it uses assets from fallout 4. They didn't hide it, but you can't blame people for being unhappy when they expected more. If there's less money needed to be put into original development, there is an expectation that your money is put somewhere ie. A lot more new content.
---
Yes duping is a major problem (but also multiple duping glitches, xp glitches, dmg glitches, crashing glitches, game erasing glitches [ the mire glitch]) . How quick were GTA to react though, it's an online service, they need to work quick. GTA immediately brought down hammer bans to stop people.
---
They chose to release their product before Christmas (even if it was ready) to make money, so don't try to give me a moral sob story. Business is Business. They clearly we're not feeling the Christmas spirit when released all their atom shop items.
---
Again. You can have your opinions. But other people can have theirs. You got what you wanted. Great. So did I. Did I hope for more, yeah a little.
---
But, you saying "oh you're exaggerating". I'm not. Facts are facts.
---
- The release and response was more of a disaster than an average for a triple AAA title.
---
- The were multiple features (I use it as an umbrella term) discussed in interviews, trailers, documentaries, that were not in the game. You can believe me or not. Your parogative, I've listed sources and facts.
---
- Since the release there has been a whole line of bad business practice issues so it shows they ain't no angels
---
And at the end of the day, it all shows. Reviews are horrible. Sales are horrible and imagine refunds numbers would be too.
---
Again, I enjoy this game. I accept the good and bad.
---
But you shouldn't have to use a bloody TSE laser gun, the base weapon is nearly half as effective as a similar weight and level ballistic weapon
---
Nice patch, but not enough for me to pick up the game again. Cya next month
---
I had this happen to me. My gun completely disappeared out of my hands midfight with the SBQ. Didnt break, it's nowhere to be found. It hasnt come back after relogs either.
---
I read that it utilizes the Rifle perk cards. Havent confirmed / tested it myself.. But might be worth keeping in mind!
---
Thanks, will keep an eye out!
---
Exploding ammo is spectacularly overpowered, game-breakingly so. They need to bite the ~~shotgun shell~~ bullet and hit this **hard** with the nerf bat.
---
Getting tons of CTD's (PC), check your window application error logs and see if it's app crashes, or something else..
---
I understand that letting go is important but your argument misses the entire points as to why many fans were very disappointed with 4 and why 76 is considered an abject failure. 
---
I'm getting this "laggy jerkfest" too.  1080ti / 7700k - It only seems to happen in certain areas for me.  It REALLY breaks the immersion.  It's almost like dropped frames or something...  I'm gonna do some digging.  Update my 1080ti drivers and I'll report back.  
---
Elder Maxson is the only true leader of the BoS. 
---
I may be in the minority here, but I still think the best possible solution is to have two different kinds of servers. 
---
One would be very passive PvP, if your in pasifist mode no one can hurt your CAMP nor you.
---
The other would be open PvP, no pacifist mode and anything goes. 
---
There really isn't a way in the games current state to please many people with the PvP system.
---
Just for the fun of it. I love building crazy things that’ll leave the next owner scratching their heads
---
I don't use mics bud but i keep my camp open and help all low levels especially a fellow Aussie.
---
HeroJoker1992 
---
When I get an accidental bounty, I find some radiation barrels and lower my max health. (Never tried killing myself though I don't think it works) With a tiny bit of HP, any player should feel save bopping you for a few free caps.
---
I'll add you - I'm dinski :)
---
i have 2 accounts and store all crap on other account so nothing id a waste to collect 
---
I went up to a random level 25 and dropped these for him. I hope he enjoyed it as much as you did!
---
There shouldn't be gutsys. Watoga spawn level 8 Handy's and eyebots as well as protections. If u have actual gutsys that I'd say that's a bug. 
---
They all appear as red regardless tho 
---
Yes, I've seen someone who has the PLAN for it.  Not just the MOD, the PLAN to make them (as in you could make T-45 jetpacks forever).  T-50 and T-60 too.  Haven't seen a PLAN for X01 or Ultracite jetpacks though.
---
Check out FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar reddits.  You might have to pay caps for one, or someone might make it for free if you give them mats (it takes flux).
---
Welcome i normally have a few lads around. We spend alot of time hunting griefers and farming resources to supply low levels while we wait for new content.
---
Cool. We play on a PvE server. I claim the Charleston landfill and Poseidon Energy workshops. You want those junk extractors and the fusion core processor. Tough shit, they're taken, and your only option of contesting them is out. Some other asshole is sitting on Thunder Mountain, and another group has taken Monongah. No fusion cores for you (or anyone else).
---
This game needs some PvP to remain fair. 
---
What I'd like to propose is what WoW does. 
---
1. You're either flagged for PvP, or you're not.  
---
2. If you're not flagged, other players can't harm you, and you can't harm them.  
---
3. If you *are* flagged, any player can attack you at any time.  
---
4. Players can turn their PvP flag ON at any time, but turning it back OFF takes five minutes.  
---
5. Certain actions will automatically flag you for PvP: taking a workshop, buffing a player who is already flagged for PvP, grouping up with a PvP flagged player, or becoming Wanted.  
---
6. You cannot unflag yourself while you're Wanted.  
---
7. While your PvP flag is ON, you gain slightly more caps and XP. Gotta balance risk and reward.
---
That's how I'd set up PvP in this game.
---
They doesn't fixed that completely - yesterday I have that problem twice. Whats worse, they still didn't fixed mod scrapping in camp problem - just lost 5 mods, 2x calibrated shocks included...
---
Good work. It looks great!
---
...Cool!!
---
What are the rules of this... Fight club?
---
I enjoy the 2SE (well I preferred my 1SE) for clearing out mobs from places I wish to loot because it is easy. Why shouldn't it be when I'm 30 levels above the mobs?
---
But I prefer Anti Armour and would love a Furious for Queen battles.
---
. 
---
If you got a nuke keycard we can get a whitesprings nuke in 15 mins. GT-Xwolfpackleader 
---
Welcome?
---
it usually slips me a mickey when i spend 30ish caps going places, then events suddenly disapearing when i get there, multiply that by the amount of patience one could have.
---
like a damn hide and seek game
---
Yes, the servers seem _much_ less stable in 1.0.4 than they were in 1.0.3
---
I've gone from maybe one disconnect a day to 1-2 an hour, it removes much of the gameplay loop.  What is the point in doing anything but mindless grinding if you could lose progress at any minute.
---
yes I have a keycard
---
Possibly due to dupers. I had a massive performance increase after they "addressed" the issue last time. Two days later it was just as bad. Soon as dupers found another way 
---
I’ll add you
---
That's a good point. Screw it. I'll just end up scrapping them. Thanks! I play alone so I have to rely on Reddit and YouTube to find these things out. 
---
Thanks for a thanksless job? Give me a break.
---
They released the game broken and nearly unplayable, for 60 bucks!
---
You buy a badly restored, broken car and weeks after that, the guys that sold you the car, start repairing it after you complaint, because you payed the full price for a brand new car.
---
After they noticed, that no one wants to buy their badly restored and mostly broken cars, they drastically reduce the price and leaving you out, without any compensation. 
---
4-5 lvl 8 robots are weak yea 20-30 are not and they aren’t just lvl 8 are they?

[Bugs] Observed Issues List - Including Multiple Player Caused Server Crash Reports - 12-30-2018 
---
http://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ab9i2i/bugs_observed_issues_list_including_multiple/
---
In it I'm suggesting there is both a player "seed" RNG and I think also a server RNG
---
I have a couple friends that have a habit of frequently loot atleast a dozen 2 shot weapons per white springs run, with a record of half of them being TSE's..
---
Working on setting up some controlled tests, but I really think there is a seed...
---
My last WhiteSprings I got a dozen anti-armor weapons in 90 minutes, accounting for more than half of the total weapons I looted, and had 13 nocturnal armor drops.
---
I totally understand that and why the sub seems to be the way it is, but even backing up claims with some solid data/arguments generally results in just more downvotes. 
---
I'm not even overtly negative on the game, just dissatisfied with how the trailer promised we'd be able to rebuild Appalachia as if there was going to be some kind of permanence of players actions on the worlds...instead it feels like nothing we do matters in the long run due to a lack of server identity from the random connect/server function. 
---
I would love PvP... If the combat wasn't completely and utterly terrible between players.
---
Oh wow, who will TSE the other first? Exciting /s
---
Question: Do we have a particular uniform, if we decide to join?
---
Should we purchase a particular Tattoo or Avatar to display our allegiance?
---
Soooo, to prove a point to a guy on the internet who's too stubborn to believe anything otherwise but too lazy to do the research. You want me to go and download the videos, edit it all to make you a nice little investigative journalism piece on "The flaws of Fallout 76", which you'd probably discard as irrelevant anyway.
---
Nah, I'm good. I've spend enough time talking to brick walls.
---
Believe what you want. It's your life. Take care 
---
Balance issues are not whats in question here, there is nothing really that out of balance that isn't a bug. So the only issue is bugs. Yeah they were known, but did they know how to fix them? They know, and we know, and we know they know the engine they use is not very good. If you wanted a game that was going to have next to no bugs that were fixed right away you dont go to Bethesda. They do listen to us and they are fixing what we want. We wanted more stash space, they didn't have to and most companies would just say "Its part of the challenge" but they increased it for us. Other companies fix bugs that are game breaking when they want. Bethesda im sure has difficulty with it since they use such a shitty engine. if you have played 3 NV or 4 you knew what you were getting into, especially considering this is the first online multiplayer game. Are you really upset when they basically told us it would have a ton of bugs with an engine that is quite terrible? They fix one things and probably break something else on accident so they have to wait to release the fix of one thing until they fix what they broke with the other fix.
---
Its a stupid thing and Bethesda is quite stupid for using such a shitty engine for their first online game, but its who they are. I hate the issues but i knew shit was going to be annoying going in. I also knew they would fix shit ASAP. If you tell me you know it would take them less time to fix it then stop complaining and get to it. If you or someone you know, knows how to fix their shitty engine multiplayer game then do it and stop complaining on reddit. Otherwise let them do what they can with the shitt shit you knew they had and you wanted. Also if the game is so broken and shitty then people should stop playing. You want the game to be better? Support them and stop shitting on them for doing what they can. 
---
Also i know what Stockholm syndrome is, you "fall in love" with someone who kidnapped you or some shit. AKA loving someone for doing something bad to you. 
---
So much this I am tired of people saying that the duping ruined the games economy or is ruining their gameplay because they feel underpowered.  I finally got a TSE tonight and honestly its cool but I was doing fine with my Tesla Rifle and Hunting Rifle.  But my sudden acquisition of a so called OP weapon has 0 bearing on anyone around me I am not suddenly 1 shotting glowing ones and I cant rip the queen a new one in 4 shots.  The only thing it really did was help me clear the silo to launch a nuke which benefited everyone else on the server more than me because I ended up quitting after testing my gun.  This game has no economy, there is no proper trade system without outside sources like reddit.  It sucks people cheated but they didnt harm the game if anything the probably gave a little hope to people who farmed 1,000 legendaries and best they got was a 2* pipe.  The only proper fix is to boost the current acquisition rates on naturally occurring weapons and stop dropping bullshit no one wants ever for any reason.

I mean, I’d either like the website with the text information or a video with a time stamp yes?  But if you want to overreact and exaggerate things, be my guest. 
---
I can confirm this.  I've gotten 2 serum recipes from the queen in about 30 kills.  But I've been super lucky, my friend has almost that many kills and hasn't gotten a single serum recipe yet.
---
DrBeardfaceMD from the Sunny Coast. I'm on most nights. Shootin' nukes and slappin' scorchqueens ✌
---
The Scorchedbeast doesn't even feel dangerous. 
---
It feels annoying. 
---
I'm never in fear for my junk when I get attacked, just annoyed that I'm gonna have to relog and waste a stimpack or two in the process.
---
There's a lot of other enemies that make me feel in danger like high level hoards of ghouls or Mole Miners and such, the Scorchedbeast isn't one of them.
---
PS: Never actually bothered to check how you spell "Scorchedbeast" so it might look ridiculous in my comments.
---
Hawaiin?
---
As long as you don't craft weapons or armor it seems to be fine. Crafting cloth vault boys repeatedly and deleting them works well.
---
However, I just mass produced fusion cores.  There didn't appear to be any graphical stuttering when crafting. Sitting on about 18,000 now after converting all that flux.
---
They should make nights back to how they were now that they have made headlamps brighter, the darker nights were great.
---
(Accidentally hit submit) I'm not the only one seeing this, observational bias aside there seems to be people to swing very very high consistently and very very low, and **Luck**(stat) has zero to do with it.
---
Woah, it's not like i do it everyday Haha, didn't expect someone to get mad over this post, it's all in good fun but hey just for you I'll never pvp again, I'll just forget about that part of the game entirely lol 
---
To the game been low level i thought you were very new sorry lol.
---
Asked a few others from the group i am in to add ya. They can lend a hand as well. As i said we spend alot of time helping others.
---
Can craft it on Xbox 
---
In later news a hauke von stagen was murdered this afternoon. Lol. Who knows.
---
Always grouped, always
---
Hopefully the next DLC and changes will make the "best" stuff no longer the best and thus the duping damage is subverted.
---
Yeah he used a little bit of slang spellings that the translator didn't catch and made it sound weird when the translator missed it, e.g. "ick" for "ich". 
---
To sum it up he thought you were also German, you did something at some farm he thought was rude, and I think he's trying to creep you out a bit (saying it's not hard to find you on discord essentially). 
---
But then the ending he seems to not be mad anymore, like it was just fun for him to find you and be talking. I don't think he's trying to be super mean.
---
In my experience you probably linked or mentioned a discord somewhere in your posts, here or elsewhere. Try searching your username + discord and see if you get anything. 
---
Yes, anyone who is in your team can build at your base.
---
Warning, be careful who you team with :)
---
I've been around since the start of beta ;)
---
Watoga can be good on some days. You can walk around the town and see a lot of Legendary no star and 3 star robots spawn. Super easy if you've done the quest line in Watoga.
---
I mean, it's goodish, but they are still kind of doing the bare minimum of "listening". There are still a bunch of issues that need addressing.
---
Ok cool what can I get you? 
---
Well fuck. Thanks I never considered checking the Effects.
---
Explains why the chems seemed to act differently it depended on what I took last. 
---
First off. Thanks Bethesda for taking care of what we asked for. That's awesome, however...
---
One thing me and my friends noticed for the first time is the spot lights don't work unless you IT them (Unplug and plug them back in).
---
Also, This wanted guy somehow found me and my base and destroyed it with his friend after they had gotten in a spat with my friends. I wasn't even playing at the time and had nothing to do with the fight between my friends and him. Nevertheless he showed up at my CAMP with his friend and wrecked everything. 
---
It was super fucking creepy. Look out my door to a guy in a mascot outfit then all of my shit explodes and he's chasing me around with a power fist. Funny thing is neither the creepy guy at my door nor the dude that came through with the explosive what ever the fuck that wrecked my base showed up on the map. They didn't show up for me or any of my friends even after logging out and logging back in. They also didn't get wanted signs after the whole ordeal.
---
Is that even feasible at this point?
---
Neck yourself, champ ;)
---
You cant hold more than 25k caps so what was the trade like 3 toons all with 20k caps trading look amongst each other.  
---
Ooopsssssssss wrong card I guess hahahaha I just looked at it 
---
Thank u
---
Yesterday after maintenance it was so nice to play with zero disconnects for a several hours. Today it seems to be worse than ever, keeps disconnecting once in five minutes :/ 
---
I'm on PC.
---
Don't listen to the babies cry. If that style of play is fun to you, keep at it. 
---
It is very fun, I ended up letting a fresh spawn kill me down the road from vault so he got a nice chunk of change to start the game.
---
holy crap, a beehive? i lived in ignorance
---
You can also put a lock on the door and leave it open. When a victim closes it they lock themselves in. 
---
Sorry bud i do get annoyed at griefing due to we tend to have to deal with alot of lads going after low levels. Normally by wrecking their bases and forcing them to try and defend themseleves. We do our best via the text chat mode to watch global chat and camp the griefers until they leave them be.
---
Its a fault of the game for not having pvp and pve servers and placing everyone into one server type.
---
[deleted]
---
That would be my guess. It’s almost always suits chasing deadlines and bottom lines that shut up games. And the gaming industry is really bad about it in particular.
---
I'm level 305 and have had ZERO TSE's, and a total of Three explosive (non-TSE's), two of them being black powder pistols...
---
That said I know a couple people who consistently loot a few TSE's per WhiteSprings run, and so many two shot weapons they just dump them on the ground...
---
I really think there is an RNG Seed (been done by other MMO's in the past) linked to character or account creation, and a server side RNG adjustment..  
---
" YOU HAVE LITERALLY SHOT YOURSELVES IN THE FOOT BY BANNING THE DUPING COMMUNITY  " Hahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhaha
---
Well still happy to help sorry about that lol.
---
Thanks for fixing your game almost 3 months after launch!
---
So now as a non cheater I'm a minority? That's a very negative mindset you have there. I'm pretty sure the dupers and exploiters are the minority.
---
Or am I reading it wrong?
---
Been playable since launch but keep griping. 
---
It's fine (':
---
They’re super viable. Probably the most effective weapon class against the scorchbeast queen in my experience 
---
Crafting guns to scrap? Am I missing something here?
---
The reasons actually don't make sense long term. If they had released a more complete game, it would attract more players to play longer. With how the game is currently, I know a ton of people who won't go near it with a ten foot pole because of the bad press surrounding it, and rightfully so. 
---
My stash of Dogfood has always hung around 15. I'm down to 6 now. Maybe I'm finding them less because I'm looting less or something? 
---
Whats with dupe fanfiction tonight? How did you even come up with this topic that you decided to answer yourself.
---
They can't track dupes as there is no unique ID, it is well known. Stop your fanfiction please its so cringy. 
---
Trying to confirm it, but agree 100%, there is a Character RNG seed (IMHO) and a server off set of some kind, on Server A I'll see a guy loot multiple TSE's in WhiteSprings and on the next server hop he loots a dozen weightless armor pieces.
---
&gt; since you apparently can’t read properly
---
&gt;Seems like you’re just set on being a salty lil child and anyone who disagrees with you is obviously just a fanboy. How pathetic.
---
u mad and you could literally google for a source like Forbes instead of demanding someone do it for you and than watch a 30min video because you are ignorant of things Todd said lol
---
https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2018/11/21/it-sure-is-interesting-to-rewatch-that-fallout-76-todd-howard-e3-reveal-now/#4840f62c5715
---
Forbes most be a salty lil child too guy who is reduced to throwing insults because people don't like his game.
---
"Yeah I bought a duped weapon but honestly who hasn't".....some dickhead justifying his duped items......I haven't ran into anything of this sort I haven't even met anyone with a explosive anything.....im a normal fallout guy I guess... why would I purposely put myself at an advantage just to ruin what could be a great experience/game...what's the point ...look at me I can own everything and anyone..seems sad IMO   
---
In the same boat at level 305
---
Nah, you're bad and should feel bad.
---
Explosive .50 cal melts the queen
---
"Thanks for listening to us"? You mean thanks for fixing your game that you released in an unacceptable state? Thanks for doing what you promised you would and doing what you are obligated to do? Okay..
---
&gt; Performance: Several improvements have been made to in-game performance.
---
&gt; Stability: The Fallout 76 game client and servers have received additional stability improvements.
---
I'm pretty sure they've said this before in previous patch notes, I doubt anything is different in terms of performance or stability after this patch.
---
GalaxyMan2015, tho i dont tend to group anyways (got no friends who play the game). I am in aus and do play generally every night for a few hours. I am level 61.
---
Yup that's how it went down
---
Does anyone know a guy for firecaps? I'm trying to get in on that Grape Mentats gravy train.
---
Only speculation so far. Fact is we don't know how in depth the logging/tracking of each player action is. If audit logs show data that they can 100% know the player is duping an item, yes. If not, nope.
---
The arguments between people on both sides are a waste of time. The only one who knows is Bethesda.
---
Still no ultrawide HUD fix. Game HUD elements still look awful.
---
But their water production is still broken.
---
I've always been confused, is that "lever action" glitch when you're trying to shoot and then zoom out, and for some reason it forces you to stay zoomed? 
---
I'm aware of Destiny, but I'm not sure if this game was designed with raising the level cap in mind. If it wasn't for supers damaging the economy, there wouldn't even need to be a change to the cap at all.
---
I only carry about 20. If I ever run low I can find more. In desperate times I can buy. I hardly ever break them these days.
---
They’re not. But there’s worse things. Like fixing them while spending another year of development using not real-user-feedback priorities. 
---
Except I can never get that event to start. It’s always prison break for me, or nothing at all 
---
I obviously can't give a specific time, but they did say new content would be announced only when it was near completion. What classifies as "near completion" you ask? that depends on how they're going to release it, if they want to release one vault at a time, we could see new content as early as this month or next as one of them is almost complete. if they want to release all three at once, it will likely be a bit longer than that, but I would hope by March at the latest.
---
How about us filthy casuals
---
I just log out when I see people by my camp. 
---
50 cal or gatling, 308 Lmg not so much
---
It really is annoying.  The same when the daily quest glitches and you can't complete it.  It would be better if the quest reset to the first stage or you could just pick it up again if it hasn't been completed.
---
I can certainly expect people not to be upset for expecting more for no reason.  If they had claimed not to use any FO4 assets then sure, but as far as I know they didn’t and expecting otherwise would be personal fault.
---
The glitches you mentioned were all fixed relatively quickly (within a week or so) minus the gun dmg glitch (if you’re talking about explosive) and as for the mire glitch I haven’t heard about and will look into it before commenting about it. 
---
I believe GTAs dupes were easier to track and deal with banning every person in fo76 with a duped item would lead to disaster due to the trading system.  Not everyone with a duped item would necessarily be a duper and wouldn’t deserve a ban. 
---
And I’m not giving you a sob story, no matter when they released a game the workers are entitled to holiday time and expecting them to work through just to fix some issues in the game is rather entitled. 
---
Atom shop items are designed by people who likely have nothing to do with coding so honestly I don’t see how that’s relevant, especially since they likely have a stockpile of already made content to release overtime. 
---
The release was far better than you’re making it out to be, especially for an online game of its type. 
---
I won’t comment on “missing features” as you’ve yet to actually provide a source, rather just telling me “they said this and said this” 
---
And I’ll definitely agree to the bad business as the canvas bag and such were disappointing to say the least. 
---
I just wanna name my guns again :[
---
not sure what level they are but I've solo'd the entire stockpile of robots before and took practically no damage, they also drop nothing 
---
Yup. And I thought Bethesda said they'd be more vocal with the community. Yet I've not seem them post anything but patch notes.
---
Pretty sure dupers and exploiters are at least 50% lol
---
I spent 90% of my NV time stopped story wise before you decide what path to take for your ending. I didn't stop so I could be friends with everyone, I stopped because literally every choice felt lackluster and fizzled. Broad themes never culminated well. Legion philosophy and reasoning became dull and uninteresting once you met Caesar and heard him speak. The dam finale was so dull. 
---
Just, meh. Not every ending needs to be perfect, hell they can all be kinda negative. Just give me a reason to care enough about these factions to WANT to help someone.
---
You assume player vendors will be any more than machines that sell ammo and healing items.  I have consistently had maxed out my cap limit there is 0 value to caps after a certain point because the game has fuck all worth buying.  I craft all my ammo and farm all my meds.  My weapons are easy to fix and hitting vendor caps every day is stupid easy.  What is some random dude going to sell to me that I cant get myself, maybe some random legendary he found.  But it will most likely be some middle tier garbage he doesnt want not something that will actually benefit me.  And for sure shit will be too overpriced for lowbies who dont have all the vendor spots unlocked and cant afford all the travel.  So what player economy exactly is going to be hurt by anything.  
---
The "dupers" are the new "synths"
---
I'll say thanks when they introduce ultrawide support with HUD element scaling.
---
Lmao you’ve been insulting me this entire time friend, please don’t try to take the high road now.  That’s beyond pathetic.  Continue to be salty and rage like a child as you wish, hope you feel better after getting it out kiddo.
---
I meant non-cheaters who legitimately acquired duped items in a trade. 
---
Holy shit, finally.
---
Pc. Pretty bad crashes today. Server disconnects out of no where, at least before I was doing "something" to inspire the crash, now its random. Fixes are nice though.
---
there's been so many posts today about this duping situation like it hasn't been here since the beta 
---
It's well known, huh? Where's that source at?
---
U online rn? 
---
God if we could only get Bethesda to actually give raiders some gods blasted love...
---
Our power armor gets no paints (and we mod authors have freaking offered them textures) and even alternative versions of the PA..
---
Our armor gets no extra textures...
---
I love the idea of making a raider community, if for no other reason then make Bethesda pay attention and give us some AtomStore / in game attention
---
You'd prefer a legendary hunting rifle to a legendary Gauss rifle? To each their own I suppose. Still Bethesda shouldn't need to be thanked as it should have been there in the first place. The current build of the game has bugs that weren't even in the last one. I got on for 10 minutes to get the numbers of the flamer cost and found out a new issue. Why am I all of a sudden able to invite players to parties that are in parties already just to get an Error message saying I can't invite them to a party because they're in a party. Why is it I can't invite someone to my party if they're in a party to begin with? Let alone the error message. 
---
&gt;So you dont have to believe me
---
I never said I don't believe you? I said Todd overpromised things
---
&gt; “From the graphics to how the controls work; the gunplay, enemy AI, 
---
You aren't even talking about what i am, I'm obviously not talking about all the good graphics in the game i'm talking about things like the horrible Pop-In guy, density sure makes things look 16X better.
---
&gt;just because you can't visually tell,
---
Lmao they weren't lying about hugely better graphics just because you can't tell.
---
How do you write something like this and not consider you might just might be taking this a little strangely 
---
Do people actually pay for items from other players? Most people I've run into charge 0 caps for almost everything. Personally if I dont actually use an item I'll just fast travel near a group of players and just drop the stuff in front of them. That's how I found my only TSE weapon, in a bag with a few thousand rounds of ammo for it.
---
This post was a waste of time.
---
Actually your 100% incorrect, I personally know a few people who have been banned...
---
When changing from non automatic rifles to the .50 cal and lmg you're trading high point damage for a higher dps. Heavy guns like these are noticeably better when fighting high health enemies like the scorch queen but you'll use far more ammo than you're used to.
---
You can mitigate this by employing a variety of heavy weapons. Using all kinds of machine guns available (.50 cal, 308 lmg, minigun/gatling gun, etc) as well as the less conventional harpoon gun or fatman. Don't forget about the gatling laser and plasma ad both also count as heavy weapons.
---
If you find yourself tight on ammo consider carrying a melee weapon like a grog axe or super sledge. This way you're not burning ammo on low health adds. You're going to have high strength to accommodate all the heavy weapons perks so melee can serve as a solid backup. 
---
HOPE THIS HELPED!

Makes very good sense long term. The bunch of people you know (and their consumer dollars) are not more desirable than putting real user feedback into their priority/design room in 2018 as opposed to 2020. 
---
Reminder: your people wouldn’t be paying them money in 2018 if the game was released polished in 2020. And as long as they keep iterating aggressively between now and then, the people you know won’t care an iota in 2020 what the state of the game in its 2018 release form was. 
---
Releasing early makes a shit ton of sense. Not all users are early adopters, is all. 
---
The plans for them are fairly common at Welch station, in my experience.
---
I'm going to share an idea as to why there is no PVE/PVP server differentiation that I've been thinking of since launch.
---
No matter what you think of the practice or it's merits, Todd Howard himself has talked about how he likes the EA "Games as a Service" model. This game monetization model has three goals:
---
1. Slowly release content over a longer period of time instead of front loading it all at the initial release, putting the pricetag for said content on DLCs or the original game with microtransactions serving as **a way to keep the player base spending during extended periods of "between content" release cycle**s. 
---
2. In order for 1 to happen, you have to have people playing your game....After all, "Games as a Service" relies on people using the service, so if no one is playing, it fails. Even in F2P models, this is important because if not enough people are playing, it's likely to cause people to leave the game altogether. **No matter what, keeping your player base playing for the term of the content is the most important, even if they're not buying microtransactions.**
---
3. Taking one and two into account and learning from the other games that have tried this model (specifically Battlefield 1 which had maps and queue types that were locked to you if you didn't buy the DLC at first), it is important to **keep as much of the player base together as together as possible, and dividing up the player base by splitting them into "has DLC map pack" and "doesn't have DLC map pack" decreases the number of people playing.**
---
Because of these, especially the last one in this case, there will likely never be PVP/PVE dedicated servers for quite some time after the initial release of 76 because this would split the player base pretty firmly down the middle. The idea being that if there is always someone playing, it'll be a lot less likely to drive players off because either PVE or PVP servers just being empty due to one side disliking changes to the game the most is going to happen when you lump these two types of players together. This is why the only way we'll see PVP content in the future, like actual PVP content and not the slap system, is going to be restricted to instances/zones that are based in normal servers (entering vaults or other content expansion areas to also enter a PVP arena, for example). It'll likely be this way until Bethesda feels like it's not in their interests to keep releasing content for the game, upon which, they'll let us make our own servers and the next fallout game will likely be done. 
---
It's a kinda shitty fix for it, but that's how corporations work, considering what they have to compete with when it comes to F2P games with more extensive and intrusive microtransactions (like the ["Wilson Lootbox"](https://youtu.be/PTLFNlu2N_M) which I think is far far worse than the cosmetics of the Atom shop) that likely net more income from said transactions...well it makes some sense. Bethesda hasn't gone full EA and we shouldn't act like they have, but they've taken a step closer to it...so we're going to have to keep our eyes out on what happens. As soon as level progression or something similar becomes available for atoms, that's a red flag, thankfully we haven't hit that yet.
---
That's their job. I'd be impressed if they had released a full game at the start, instead of rushing out a broken product which they're desperately trying to fix so they don't lose what whales are left who spend money on atom points.
---
And ARK has PVE servers. Just saying.
---
You can creatively still raid on a PVE but most require the owner to not have logged in for X time, generally a week, a month in some cases. 
---
And use the lowest charge core first, please:(
---
Are you not strong enough because low level or lack of equipment or was this hyperbole.  Id be happy to talk you through expanding into the harder content without the need for game breaking equipment, and if you are on Xbox I could even craft you a few items to help you along the way.
---
And it's even more unbearable if you have a TS one. Tried to use it in two SBQ fights yesterday and I didn't even use a single ultracite core. Two weapon repairs in less than one clip of ammo is pretty ridiculous as it is...
---
I have yet to find a single plan I don’t already have behind a lock and every time I’ve been to venture (once a day since I started during the beta) I’ve picked that lock and never found the stash. My luck is shite
---
Getting a ton of instability, I went from 90 FPS 100% of the time to barley 58 with this update and non-stop crashing, had a dozen application crashes in about an 45 minute period  
---
Yep.
---
Can't scrap legendaries. I would sell them or drop em. Don't forget to put on a charisma perk before sale if you have it. I only get 16 caps cuz I don't spec for charisma.
---
below are images of the armor i am currently wearing and their mods. they are not 100% matching the DR in the tables, though the ER is matching. i also included the underarmor i am wearing as well as all the perks i have equipped when i took the screenshots. i have no other buffs on that would affect any resist. i have also added a table in the event the image links dont work (first time linking from imgur) .
---
If anyone has any possible thoughts as to why the DR is higher than shown in the tables, as well as the difference between the 2 sturdy limb pieces (right leg, left arm) and 2 heavy limb pieces (left leg, right arm), i am willing to listen to any thoughts.

There’s also a lot of mutfruit near the entrance of the west tek building 
---
Gist of it: first get max rank of Starched Genes and preferably max rank of Class Freak. Go to a high radiation area that has a rad shower close by. I got all of mine at Emmet Disposal Site inside the main building. With Genes off, get mutated, then put Genes on if you want to keep it. Use rad shower nearby to clear rads. Then server hop. Repeat the process.
---
Some notes:
---
Max Class Freak is not required but it will make getting an undesirable mutation less of a burden.
---
You can clear a mutation with Genes off, but if you have multiple mutations going, it’s random which one you lose. So you play roulette if you’re trying to only get certain ones and have to get lucky pretty much.
---
Also don’t use the rad shower to clear just one mutation as you’ll end up wiping a few at once. Use Radaway to clear them one at a time.
---
You have to server hop after every mutation regardless if you keep it or not.
---
I have nearly all the mutations but stopped pressing my luck once I got marsupial. Avoided empathy too.
---
&gt;horde ALL materials for crafting.
---
FTFY ;)
---
now i cant stop wondering if this is even possible
---
The reality of the jetpack is that it is a quickly discarded toy. Go down the mutation route instead.
---
Dude you are way too upset about this, you're the one who started insulting me first "Friend"
---
why would I be salty and rage over this?
---
You do understand i'm forgetting about this conversation as soon as i turn on my PS4 in 5mins to play FO76
---
I guess you aren't going to be able to do the same
---
Gat gun is where it is at right now for heavy guns.  The others are fun,  but the gat wrecks shit better.
---
They have by running out of things to do.
---
So is your comment, so...? 
---
Just ignore and move on. Downvote if needed.
---
How a bout a good pip-boy menu?
---
Correct. As much as I enjoyed the game, it should never have been released in the state it's in. The fact people are praising Bethesda for fixing what should have been fixed in the first place is odd. 
---
I'd not be surprised if FO76 shuts down in a year or so, even the whales will get bored of spending 18 quid for a power armor skin, and once they stop making atomic store sales, they'll drop this game fast.
---
Wow how many years have many many games allowed cross character trading and loot stashing dude. You dont seem like you understand the history of online games as much as you say you do.
---
Are you trying to make stable flux?
---
I added you (:
---
Detail doesnt always mean fancy pretty graphics. detail means being able to push things further, more objects, in this case, the amount each cell is able to store. The amount of ground cover (ie. the instanced grass). the view distance even, the sky, etc.
---
So by saying 16x the detail, doesnt have to mean, now every flower in the game is a full renderable 3d mesh, and every strand of hair on the back of a super mutant (do they have hairy backs?) is individually rendered. It means larger map, more objects squeezed into locations, this includes static, animated, instanced, AI driven objects, a longer view distance, static GI, improved PBR lighting, improvements to the volumetric lighting, etc. etc.
---
So yeah I'll stand by "they weren't lying about better graphics just because you can't tell." coz you are certainly proof of that statement.
---
It's like 30% less xp. I hear you though. I thought it was a feature and didn't think anything of it till I read the patch notes today. Like if I drop a nuke on a golf course I deserve alot of xp imo. 
---
Are you a furry or something? Wolves...please.
---
What're people giving away? Don't ever see that. Most guns sold I see are around 1k tse or not 
---
I've been wanting this since the game was announced. I couldn't possibly have any less interest in Pvp. 
---
It was marketed as a PVE co-op with opt in PVP. what's opt in about receiving slap damage of 200 times your health?
---
I get bounties and workshops and the like but I shouldn't have to run a PVP survivability build to enjoy my co-op PVE game. 
---
Yeah, it could have. A shame, really.
---
Please tell me how I insulted you?  I believe the most insulting thing I said before you decided to call me lazy and then proceed to cursed, was that it was silly to expect me to watch a 30min video for a 4man quote.  You may want to read these messages and make sure you’ve been replying to the right person.  You say “why would you be salty and rage over this” and that’s exactly what I’d like to know?  But if you want to curse and be a rude lil child and then completely act like you’ve done nothing, then be my guest.  Have fun playing the game man! 
---
If you're on PS4 you can have some. I have a lot leftover and I leveled enough to complete my core build.  I'll grab the other cards as I level naturally.
---
Addiction withdrawal effects don't seem to show up under effects. Take an addictol and see if that helps.
---
Duped tse culling?
---
It's an okay play but not worth $60 much less $25 from my experience.
---
And my experience is seeing players with marsupial and bird bones mutations with a shotgun with negative range stats that grants it infinite range.  So they can jump high, float in midair so basically fly, then shotgun explosive two shot players from afar because they can fly, and have an infinite range close range explosive weapon.
---
Please rename this game Bethesda 76, because it is not a Fallout game.

&gt;. It means larger map, more objects squeezed into locations, this includes static, animated, instanced, AI driven objects, a longer view distance, static GI, improved PBR lighting, improvements to the volumetric lighting, etc. etc.
---
Again
---
I never said this game didn't have this; I quoted what Todd said this game has that it clearly doesn't Detail being one of those things because even with better Detail doesn't mean I can't complain about where the Detail is bad in the game.
---
Having systematic weather systems in the game that you can "see across the map" when I play the game I don't have that because the game doesn't always render that far and instead I have horrible pop-in until I reopen the game depending on how bad the Server is acting up.
---
You are obviously having some kind of Language barrier or something
---
I had the same issue,your addicted to something that’s not showing use adictol to fix it.
---
Pop a disease cure &amp; some radaway just to be sure plus a drink &amp; bit of food.
---
Pretty sure those aren't the same people, buddy. 
---
I would agree if this was a full beta leading up to an official release in 2020, but because the game has already released in an official form, it'll be considered an old game at that point and will not get nearly as many sales as they could have if they polished the original final release. 
---
For example, No Man's Sky dropped off shortly after release due to similar issues, and even though they fixed nearly all of the problems, they still aren't making the sales numbers they could have originally gotten if the game released in the state that was promised. 
---
All of that, plus it's nearly impossible to sell people a 2 year old game at $60. The only game for xbox/Playstation/PC that I know of that can hold up that well is GTA, but even then you're pushing it because it's often available on sale different times during the year. 
---
Super easy anti grief? ALT F4. Maybe not the most fun for you but also robs griefers of their fun. 
---
Mothman is bush league. Interloper thrall 4 lyfe.
---
Just seen the patch notes for the latest fix, although it mentions quest bug fixes there is no mention of this quest yet 🤨
---
Second only to an idea some years ago to capture (the then alive) Bin Laden, give him a sex change operation and send him back to Afghanistan. 
---
giantpunda. More of a solo player though but open to chat and trade. Offload some plans I have extras of. Maybe scum a fast travel from time to time :)
---
Go west!
---
Noticed this when I tried to bash a radroach :-D
---
If they haven't explicitly given permission to use their game footage in videos DMCA notices can be filed against videos that actively show players breaking the EULA agreement. Video tutorials and full game-play footage are not actually covered by fair use either but most companies usually look the other way and take the free press. It's becoming more common that game developers DMCA content showing cheating/exploits and it's not abusing any system, it's their legal right.
---
That's what makes the idea of reduced damage so good. It gives you control. Imagine if you didn't have the reduction? You wouldn't play the game at all because you'd constantly be trolled without mercy 
---
I am just happy for them to use it; it kinda sucks the bridge only exists when I am playing. It would of been awesome if it was a permanent fixture.
---
I have two, tried both kinds. I’m sure they will get to it eventually.
---
Not only do I support this, but I'd be THRILLED if we could get teh CAMP area reshaped to a square or a rectangle instead of a circle. All the parts are right-angled, let us use the space properly. This'd allow for nice neighbors to set up all in a row.  
---
And it'd be \*awesome\*.
---
Hmm, that sounds like the connection point isn't in the same place as the point which makes it change to being drawn connected. Weird.
---
What ere seeing is the video game industry transitioning from the old model to the new. 
---
It’s a welcome transition - it stings a bit come launch day (both to consumer and to the studio) but ultimately its best for us all. 
---
Even if titles stale out fast as you say. 
---
Gattling uses a lot less ammo. Would love TSE one but I've found 3 regular two shots and they're not bad against the queen. 
---
Yeah I think it had to do with that, because every time I placed the generator, it appeared up one floor from where I put it.
---
There's no fucking excuses for constant server crashes, admittedly it has gotten a lot better, but it shouldn't happen at all. The Red Dead servers are perfect. Why aren't Fallouts?!
---
&gt; Not everyone realizes what they are.
---
Yeah, right.
---
My waving santas are always in tandem, so prolly not
---
This is on XB1 but I give away everything that I'm not going to use, I don't really need the caps. I've personally run into everything from food, to stimpaks, to TSE weapons just lying on the ground. 
---
&gt; TSE however can be glitched out with the right steps to let one instakill the SBQ
---
I've never seen or head about that happening, so how about you provide some proof of that before you claim it as fact, or are we going back to the myth of randoms being able to steal your things in trade?
---
Mrs Robinson, you're trying to seduce me. Aren't you?
---
Lol here we go, dont agree with you, so it must be a language issue, no language is not the issue here. You keep throwing comments about graphics into each of ur responses, so I respond to them, because that is what I know, I am a graphics programmer, when it comes to the other aspects of the game, I am not experienced enough to speak on them
---
1. First time you said in response to my terrain statement
---
I backed it up with facts
---
2. Next you stated 
---
&gt;Lmao they weren't lying about hugely better graphics just because you can't tell.  
---
&gt;How do you write something like this and not consider you might just might be taking this a little strangely
---
And I clarified what I meant.
---
So yeah I was always responding to things you directly stated.
---
Yeah bud just listen to the holotape. Fun thinking but it's all sorta fleshed out as this scientists project, is it not? Setup is clearly self built.
---
There's a digital scale in the game ? 
---
Well I just saw two level 68 assaultrons, 2 lvl 50 Sentry bots and a bunch of random butlers etc. On xbox1 so if you are soloing the entire area of robots you must be too good to play anymore and should probably quit. 
---
How often is the crashing/ DC? Say over an hour period? Any idea or nah
---
Gone as in everything is removed once I leave the server? Nobody will see what I made once I leave?
---
I want to play stealth in my PA, you play stealth in what you want, k ?
---
Create a new character, hand you legendaries to your friend, get him to go to Vault 76 - pass them to you. Now you have a Bank Character. 
---
Thank World of Warcraft.
---
You can sneak past the scorchbeast in sneak mode by hugging the ridge to the left going in/to the right going out. I f***ing hate that thing.
---
The company itself seems to have broken their employees, not just their game...
---
Like do they even proofread these things?  3 seperate entries for the same thing:
---
&gt;Crafting: Level 25 armor and above now requires ballistic fiber to craft.
---
&gt;Crafting: Ballistic Fiber becomes required for armor at level 25 instead of previously at level 20.
---
&gt;Crafting: Ballistic Fiber also is now required for repairing armor at level 25 and above instead of previously at level 20
---
Please if you aren't treating your employees with respect and subjecting them to these crazy dead lines, don't expect quality when you try to force quantity out of them.  Just look at this, quantity over quality at it's...  Do I say best or worst?
---
I wanted to enjoy this game so much, but you can only be forced to deal with so much before you just put it down and move on to being a cowboy in 1899 just trying to have some god damn faith!
---
I never waste my time setting it zero in trade. I usually just dump stuff in places I'll know people will find it. Too many people cancel the trade too often. Dropping it and hoping they find it is my style haha 
---
I think it's not even 20%
---
I run when I can but I was too close to a fissure. :x I always forget server hopping is a thing. 
---
Ah, well that's much less pessimistic then ;-)
---
Why does everyone assume people's TSEs are duped? I had a post about a bug that git down voted to hell because I have a TSE I found... Not everyone is doing or buying from super for end game gear some of us have over 300hours played
---
Well it is now.  On PC.  Legendary Hunting Rifles now drop.
---
I had less of this and more  infinite "searching for world" after trying to server hop
---
Not very hard to do in this game, you would have to build specifically to not be OP
---
It’s probably around 20% if i’m being serious. I think that’s still a lot though. 
---
This is a corporation not your friend. They make "cool shit" for you because you paid them money to do so. If they deliver not just a bad product, but a *laughably* bad product then you have every right to give them shit.
---
Just edited my original comment-- v-sync may have fixed it.  I probably lost that setting on a driver update, but it wasn't giving me trouble until this update.  Now it's all as smooth as silk.  At least on-screen.  Server issues still exist.
---
Now that duping is gone, can you fix the part where having high amounts of items in your inventory made the servers unstable in the first place? Because I don't trust you to have caught all the people with 1000 legendary items at once and I don't think there will never be a dupe exploit again.
---
My friends who play PC only said it was noticably worse since the patch, 3 friends all having the same experience. I have seen more than a few posts confirming that others in the community are noticing this as well. 
---
He might be referring to the people who did a lot of griefing would be sent into servers with others of the same.  I don't know how well it worked, last time I played there was still a lot of cheaters/griefers in random servers
---
it's also worth noting that heavy machinegun perks are under the strength category, so you'll need at least 9 strength to max out all three cards. I'd have a look at a build planner first and make sure you can spec for them and still keep rifles as a fallback in case you just don't like how they work, it really sucks to realize at level 50+ that your build isn't great and then have to respec one point at a time or roll a new character
---
I've never sold a weapon. I have given away plenty. Mostly to newbs just out the Vault. There isn't any need to trade with a person.
---
Sure I *have* traded for my TSE but realistically I was doing fine without it. Hell I killed myself a lot less without it.
---
While there are maybe some items I would like to complete my character like an X01 jetpack the game pretty much provides everything you could need. There is no need for an economy and it isn't like Diablo where you need or want specific matching OP items. 
---
I want a mothman light. As in I chopped off his head and am using it as a lamp shade. 
---
That's wierd, I get ~375 at level 40.
---
Don't bother with horde events either
---
Had to change that habit because of the stash limit in FO76 lol...
---
&gt; Balance issues are not whats in question here, there is nothing really that out of balance that isn't a bug.
---
That literally only makes it worse.
---
&gt; Yeah they were known, but did they know how to fix them?
---
What? Do you think they had some coding revelation in the last two months? Did all the devs go back to school for a couple months? Naw they just didnt want to spend money or time before launch. 
---
&gt; They know, and we know, and we know they know the engine they use is not very good. If you wanted a game that was going to have next to no bugs that were fixed right away you dont go to Bethesda.
---
Well that's for sure. No one should be buying Bethesda games. At least we agree there. 
---
&gt; They do listen to us and they are fixing what we want. We wanted more stash space, they didn't have to and most companies would just say "Its part of the challenge" but they increased it for us.
---
Holy shiiit you actually are a lunatic fanboy. They literally did HAVE to fix the stash size, because players were quitting. I cant believe you think they are doing it out of the goodness of their hearts. This is insane. And again, literally everyone told them it was a problem BEFORE launch. So no, they dont care about us. They dont listen. They only care about money, or the lack of money they are making. 
---
&gt; Bethesda im sure has difficulty with it since they use such a shitty engine.
---
Do you think other companys pull an engine out of their backsides? No, they fix them, before they put out a game on it. Every engine needs fixing. Every company is using an engine from decades ago, that would be broken if they hadn't out any work into it. Like Bethesda creation engine. 
---
&gt; if you have played 3 NV or 4 you knew what you were getting into, especially considering this is the first online multiplayer game. Are you really upset when they basically told us it would have a ton of bugs with an engine that is quite terrible? They fix one things and probably break something else on accident so they have to wait to release the fix of one thing until they fix what they broke with the other fix.
---
So you didnt actually play those games did you? Onoy NV was bad enough to be anywhere on the same level as 76. And most of this stupid comment falls back on your misunderstanding of how engines work. 
---
&gt; I also knew they would fix shit ASAP.
---
Its january. Even wildcard fixes ark bugs faster then that. You are brainwashed if you consider this ASAP. I'm almost speechless.
---
&gt; If you or someone you know, knows how to fix their shitty engine multiplayer game then do it and stop complaining on reddit.
---
I'm not even complaining anymore. I'm ridiculing you. You can say the game is fun all you want, but once you start praising them, I'm gonna call you out as the idiot you are.
---
&gt; Also if the game is so broken and shitty then people should stop playing. You want the game to be better? Support them and stop shitting on them for doing what they can.
---
People did stop playing. In droves. And this isnt an AA support group, it's a business. The only support that matters is money.
---
&gt; Also i know what Stockholm syndrome is, you "fall in love" with someone who kidnapped you or some shit. AKA loving someone for doing something bad to you.
---
First sentence there is close enough. The second one is stupid.
---
Cause they're hard as fuck to find. I purchased mine for under 2k each. Mine are probably duped. I've played for hundreds of hours as well and never found one.  Wasn't thinking you duped it but you left that info out. It's so common not sure why anyone would not have assumed that 
---
Yeah mine def not duped...I’d have a backup in that case lol
---
4. The hand water pump animation is insufferable!  It's easier to walk up to a pond/stream and collect.  Unless they fix it so it doesn't rely on the animation to finish before it loads the item into inventory, the hand pump is purely decorative.
---
Every time you play hit an amusement park and grab them toys and you won't have to worry about screws. 
---
Quite happy about the fixes except I won't be able to take pictures anymore with the bugged Scorched that do not attack you.(was a enjoyable part of gameplay for me at this point)
---
I haven't had it happen to me personally, but I've heard it's pretty common. I thought it had been patched though
---
I'm having the same issue with VATS and my two-shot lever action rifle.  I'm on PC, so I don't think it's platform dependent.
---
That’s pretty extreme.  The ones at hundreds of thousands of pounds are the ones that should be raising flags.
---
What is the weight limit ?
---
Non-relevant anecdote, but the German part made me remember it. Was putzing around the Enclave bunker and walked past someone in the Enclave Officer outfit. You know the one, pretty damn third reich esque, makes you feel a little awk about this whole Enclave thing.
---
To tease him a bit I opened my mic and said in a really high nasally voice "guttentag mein fuhrer!". 
---
Motherfucker started speaking fluent german to me in seconds. Clearly engaging the idea WAY PAST my self giggle greeting. I don't know German at all. Kinda started just meandering away after replying "...si". I broke socially. Brain could just NOT COMPUTE where to take that interaction next, LOL.
---
Probably the strangest moment I've had in this game with another person, haha
---
Please check the OP and share your system specs.
---
THAT's the bulldoze? 
---
I thought we were going to be able to clear spots in forests and whatnot so we could actually choose where we wanted to build.
---
Now I'm even more disappointed in bethesda than before.
---
Your right thank you for listening to us Bethesda.
---
Let's just hope dupers don't find another way round.
---
I would suggest an amnesty would be the best thing to start with, have a "bin" added that items can be put in, but not taken out, bin appears outside 76, its published all over the steps that will be taken....
---
1. Amnesty - to get rid of 90% of your duped items will allow you to stay in game. (1 week)
---
2. Bounty - all players not agreeing or taking part in said amnesty have for 2 weeks a perminate 500 cap bounty placed on there heads, every time they log in the whole server hunts them down, and repeat - this can of course be stopped if they drop there items in the bin outside 76!
---
3. Amnesty and bounty didnt work - week 4 - they are moved to cheaters servers and can only come back when they make use of the bin!
---
Sorry, I meant your ownership will be gone. If the server resets everything everyone built will be gone but as far as I know that is random
---
109%!Disagree, build dependent.
---
**Helmet**. 
---
Ranged Build - Recon is helpful, or life signs, but perception is hard to argue with.  
---
Melee Build - life signs is mega helpful for running down NPCs, especially at night in the rain.  
---
**Torso**  
---
All - Motion assist is cheap to make and +2 STR Is good for everyone. Emergency protocols frees up perk cards
---
Melee Build - Tesla coils or reactive plates is x1,000,000 times better than a jet pack, without question, with default for all be going fallback choices.
---
Ranged Build - Reactive plates is solid, for ranged builds, when dealing with hordes or being swarmed, especially if your a TSE looser ;). It also conserves ammo and wear on weapons as the roaches and low level mobs will die quickly and high level Supermutants will kill themselves on your armor. Emergency protocols is solid, as is Core assembly for AP regen.
---
**Arms** 
---
Can't disagree, mainly because Bethesda has yet to implement any of the better choices we mod authors provided for fallout 4
---
**Legs**
---
Debatable, Calibrated shocks are wonderful for all, but the AP regen upgrades, especially paired with the core assembly can mean near endless AP for Sprinting, VATS use, scope work or just bloody power attacks. 
---
4. Long shot perk doesn't show any change in range for equipped weapon.
---
So you want all legendaries wiped cause "MIGHT BE DUPED!"
---
You realize that if thousands of players lose hundreds of hours of grind for that one weapon they wanted, the game will literally get such negative press that the game will be dead?
---
There's already a lot of negativity around the game, it can't survive any more without losing it's ability to gain players.
---
I have a mule that has all my semi good legendary weapons on it that I can’t fit in my stash but aren’t good enough to use. Do I deserve to be banned?
---
Do they stay in your home on login/logout? I havn't gotten that perk yet because I wasn't sure how it was going to work.
---
Well spoken, made some good points 
---
I walk around with 600 pounds worth of weapons and junk when I’m getting ready to sell to the traders. It ain’t so bad when you have speed demon. Plus marathoner, and action boy perks. 
---
I actually spend a lot of time overencumbered. 
---
 And now I could potentially  get banned for it? Doesn’t seem fair
---
First it was the YouTuber show in off my (well almost all) of my robot farming.  Now my stake house too?  
---
Adding rn 
---
I've bought plans I needed from people who do a lot of Workshops. Otherwise it might takedozens if hours to stumble on one.
---
I'd love to become a magazine or bobble vendor. Made a few hundred caps selling a bunch I had to to people with specific builds. You don't HAVE to but I like trading. Gives me something to do. 
---
If the economy is changed with scarcity and other changes, I could trading being a lot more useful 
---
&gt;Prototype2001-5 points· 2 days ago  
---
&gt;I've duped 512k 3 star TSE shotties, gave away few hundred at a time to a few people and this was back in October. I think 500,000 weapons should be enough? Or should i do a couple more iterations and get me few million?

Admitted duper gets massive upvotes immediately? ok
---
Keep bragging about your wannabe hacking life, dork. You are nothing more than a script kiddie.
---
He said over 150 hours. That's a pretty good amount to judge the game. Plenty to do a bunch of stuff and finish the end game mission. It is only just a little less than I've got.
---
My favorite release ever has been titanfall 2. 
---
Free DLC. Only cosmetic microtransactions and no loot boxes(which is something fo76 did right as well). 
---
The most polished game on release I have possibly ever played, at least since updates have been a thing. They still support the game. There are still a lot of people entertained by it. I've stopped playing call of duty and switched over to titanfall entirely after black ops 3.
---
If a company can pull something like that off and win over disgruntled gamers, they can easily steal the profits from big players, which shows that these new ways of doing things aren't always that great. 
---
Fortnite is the only success that has really thrived through the new business strategy you're describing. Nobody else has pulled it off well enough to gain noteriety. You could say Destiny, but that game wasn't nearly as buggy as this, and it plays much more like an MMO with boss fights and such than fo76 does. 
---
Interesting. I never knew they had pve servers. I was always interested in the game but didn't want play something that felt like chore (bases being in danger when offline)
---
Quite the stretch.
---
Support can't restore anything so they have no clue what your character has.
---
If you corrupt your character by doing too many maps at once the official solution, from support, is create a new character.
---
I have my doubts anyone with duped gear will be punished in any way
---
I'm sitting here searching for reddit posts that compiled tons of info from like 3 weeks ago. Reddit isn't always.... intuitive. Honestly would love a page that brings that wealth of info to a resource page that isn't just some ad hungry wiki. 
---
Hard to get a centralized outside site going these days, but I think OP is making the right sorta effort.
---
"Crafting: “Hardened Mass” will no longer be scrapped when “Scrap All Junk” is selected."
---
Found out about this f*** up the hard way recently. It really pissed me off that I have put in so much work and the the game decides to scrap them with "scrap all junk". It shouldn't be difficult to go through the list of required crafting items and make sure that it doesn't scrape all the wrong items.
---
So jealousy. Cool bro.
---
Drop all your stuff. Check weight. Hope server doesn’t disconnect.
---
All of them 
---
Sorry mate, wrong path
---
Noticed it also and Not sure it's a bug, allot of the community wanted a "page down", this could be their way of a page down or "wrap" feature

Got it in Patrol Day today @ lvl 31

That's the plan with the floor bord trap all over the floor to they can't jump out but the trap floor over a Clif sounds fun unless there in power armour 
---
It's just the shape of a model, it's not a functional object at all.
---
Nah brah, GFY.
---
Yeah it's absolutely disappointing how glaringly weak the Alien Blaster is even if you use the normal alien cells and not the fusion cell mod. They should at least make it do more damage than a plasma pistol I think so it's worth using.

FALLOUT 76: INSIDE THE VAULT – DECEMBER 4, 2018
---
As we approach the end of 2018, we have a few more details to share with you about our current patch schedule. In addition, we are excited to announce that, starting in early 2019, we plan to release a variety of in-game events that will take place over the course of a week. These events will be different every time, and will often provide a small buff or create an interesting twist on normal gameplay.
---
Ungrateful for what? Not putting up with their complete bullshit and disregard of integrity?
---
Best update ever!
---
You actually want bethesda to start censoring videos that show bugs that can benefit the player. Legal right or not, that's quite the slippery slope. To even mention that people technically don't have the right to even make videos for any game brings me to the question - why do you want to bend over backwards for a company in defense of their bad game design. It makes no sense, and the actual solution is simple from the beginning. No lawyers or DMCA take downs needed.
---
Any sane developer would have have fixed something like this as soon as possible and temporarily disabled whatever feature caused the bug to begin with. But this is bethesda, where DMCA take downs are a more preferable option.
---
Not at present, and I shall certainly not ask anyone to purchase microtransactions, ever, even if we do decide on something. We may settle or something available for free in the base game, but for now, the service is most important. At most, it would be great if you could get hold of the metallic letter plans so that you could advertise the service on your camp.
---
Is the new Patch good ? How is the Performance ? Is it better ? 
---
i have over 100 but only because i have so much room to carry stuff now, if i ever need room i drop all but 30, thats more then enough
---
i only ever open lvl 2 and 3 locks hoping for a plan i havent learned yet(ive learned a crapton) lvl 0 and 1 locks just arent worth the time anymore
---
It's a stretch to think they will restore order, I agree.  Nothing can be done if they can't differentiate the real items from the duped.   I'm going to hope for the best though.
---
Cut it out with this stupid witch hunt bullshit..
---
I have spent days over 200% enjoying the hell out of walking around the wasteland and finding new things and getting tons of random encounters..
---
I also have "mules" which are a staple of MMO's..
---
Try thinking outside the box and stop regurgitating the same nonsense being spouted over and over..
---
One great suggestion was looking for over 10,000 of a bobble head, or more than 1,000 of a collectible mag, or more than 10 of a legendary item identical in every way that it stacks..
---
Farming sugar grove would have reduced this time by 90%
---
Not all legendaries. Just the dupes. 
---
Weapons, armor, stuff, PA frames, it all has a chance to just disappear on a crash/disconnect.  
---
But we cannot mention these things, the threads or comments will be downvoted.
---
I think he means 200% of their weight limit
---
Posts like this show how little a good chunk of the fallout community knows / understands about MMO's and their decades (am I really that old) of tradition.
---
really? Thanks!
---
Preach.. 
---
In the same boat..
---
How many have you found?  If it's just one compare that to how many you've seen or heard about being abused.A good deal of the ones being circulated were duped. It's perfectly reasonable to guess you got it through a trade. 
---
That's the thing do enough damage to someone not fighting back and you can kill them. If they have TSE weapons and stacks of bobble heads activated they can and will one shot you. It has happen to me and I have seen it done to my wife who plays with me. Yet I have been called a liar and had abuse sent my way when posting about it. Reddit is great at making new friends and finding help or advice but there are a lot of toxic people on here too.
---
That's not much to go off of.  I would appreciate something less cryptic at this point like the name of the location since I'm trying to figure out if it's something I missed or some place I've been but don't recall this detail.  Was this Lucky Hole mine?  I've seen those faces several times, I just don't remember them being so many arrayed together.  Maybe my light was just too dim at the time...
---
119 bounty hunter only target griefers and dupers (that might have been ended).
---
I salute your work from one hunter to another.
---
Treasure maps and distant thunder, but it's very grindy and soul crushing 
---
Why did they lower xp from killing bloated glowing ones? Those things are damn near impossible to kill unless you're a high level and they do enormous damage, and now they reward players the same way killing the scorchbeast queen rewarded players: the middle finger.
---
NOOOOOOOO, pls no patch on PS4, this is unplayable!!!! 
---
Some Dinki Di is the best for post-apocalyptic cuisine.
---
Definetly would love this. I'm lvl 30 mostly keep to myself although i do enjoy positive interaction with other players , teaming up,trading , etc . I also have had high level characters fast travel around me or run into me and kill me in two shots me not standing a chance caught off guard, then take my stuff and leave. It's very very agravating because it has happend to me multiple times. Could we just rule people like that out and give them their own server ? 
---
TBH I think 0.01 is a much more reasonable number than 0.1 or 0.001.
---
I definitely didn’t say that anywhere in my post. Let’s save calling Mr. Blowsy stupid until after a readover. Cuz I said high leveled players can hate the game, but their opinion is useless if they continue to play the game. Let me also reiterate to you that I understand a vast majority view Fallout 76 as a shitshow, I know a lot of people who bought it, played it, then got rid of it. Not played it, hated it, then continued to burn money on it. Just cuz I love it doesn’t mean everyone else does. 
---
I wonder if they'll patch mods and bleached dogwood not to scrap like they did with hardened mass?
---
Again, what is the weight limit ?
---
Xbox one
---
Omega 4615
---
Early warnings quest is bugged where it wants me to craft 5 upgraded motors when I already have them crafted and in my inventory 
---
Any and all people joining all events should be auto teamed. People who are at the start of the Queen are auto teamed so why not late comers?
---
Heck maybe all rad zones should auto team people. And it isn't just a TSE inspired request. I've gotten bounties on random who walk into my established field of fire with non TSEs.
---
When the guy is crouched down with an M2 unleashing 250 rounds of .50 BMG API-T *DON'T WALK IN FRONT OF THEM!!! *
---
I personally have three and my friend has two. It's not hard to believe people have morals about buying items. Some people are trying to explain bugs and inform people about them. But as soon as someone mentions TSE downvoted. Stop blaming stuff on dupers and blame the game. That's the problem.
---
I absolutely hate it when dupers brick servers with that crafting method making servers unplayable but other than that are duped items really that big of deal? People on this reddit are scared of their TSE items potentially being wiped but these are the legit players who bought items from dupers, the very players they are trying to alienate from the game. Make up your fucking mind guys 
---
Are you on PC?.
---
The limit of being overencomboured 
---
Nope on Xbox.
---
Agrinding I shall go, then 😊
---
What tab is the garage door even under? Having trouble finding it.
---
My camp is near sunnytop and I've been getting attacked by scorchbeasts a lot recently 
---
Spewin i was gonna say add me i hunt assholes that prey on others. But yes as i said in the main post we need PVP and PVE servers.
---
Nah brah. You can put all the strength, intel, whatever, points into perks you want - it's going to be more effective to stick with rifles. Unless you have a mountain of mats to put into ammo and repairs, and want to use nothing but that gun, and want to use power armor, and have an effective legendary effect.  
---
Heavy guns seem more to be a "I want to use heavy guns" thing rather than a "I want to be effective" thing.
---
Did I miss this in the patch notes? Or did they leave stuff out again...?
---
Thanks. If only I could save this
---
" You are the reason the gaming industry will continue to release games in a pre-alpha state  " 
---
Pretty sure most Steam users are the bigger part of that problem there.
---
&gt; Also, splitters absolutely break the weapons faster.
---
I was very sad when I realized this the hard way. Automatic laser rifle with beam splitter breaks before you even run out the full clip. That's just flat-out not fun.
---
I don't think those legit players can say with the hand on the heart that they didn't know those items they were buying were not legit.
---
It was rather alarming. And I did feel sad. I mean, who really wants to die while taking a crap, especially in an outhouse that looks like it was made from splinters 
---
I have twoshot laser rifle, it breaks faster than virginity of modern girls. It is at my mule for 3week already. 
---
&gt;Crafting: Set minimum component cost of workshop buildings requiring steel, wood or plastic to 2.
---
I don't understand this. Is this an increase or decrease?
---
&gt;[PC] Infinite Load: Fixed an infinite load screen that could occur when attempting to join a server on PC.
---
So far as I'm seeing, load in is much faster, but it seems like it's still off. Instead, the environment loads, but the actors and enemies have a delayed load in. I've loaded into zones only to see a static ghoul. I blast it, only to have players finally render in in front of me. I'd honestly prefer a little bit delayed of load in if it meant I could immediately interact with the world rather than marsupial jumping onto a car and waiting for the server to catch up.
---
Not sure if this is fixed. I've seen scorch one handing miniguns sideways near fissure site prime.
---
&gt;Ammo Vending Machines: Fixed an issue where some Ammo Vending Machines were only selling repair components.
---
I'm not trying to be snarky, but I don't know anyone that uses these currently. I feel like this one will be underappreciated.
---
&gt;Weapons: M79 Grenade Launcher is now considered an explosive weapon in perks instead of being incorrectly considered a shotgun.
---
I'm confused, I thought this was already fixed. Was the last patch not successful?
---
&gt;Strange in Numbers: Strange in Numbers effects now scale properly with multiple teammates (with and without mutations).
---
I think this is still bugged. It suppresses positive mutation effects if a team mates leaves party or is disconnected. In big events, like fighting the SBQ this is a huge liability. I still don't use the perk card because it's obvious it needs more work.
---
&gt;Trade: Changed caps limit for player-to-player trades from 5000 to 25000.
---
This has introduced a new problem where team mates that scroll too far in order to set price to 0 scrolls it back to the maximum value. Also, can we just make it so we can type in the amount? I know console players wouldn't have that option, but it seems like an easy enough thing to implement. There's still plenty of trading menu things that need to be implemented, like support for item for item trades, or purchasing things at X:1 value like buying 3000 rounds for 1000 caps. I know this is probably in the works, but currently players are having to use work arounds and given that less than half the player base uses the intended microphones (or that chat works unreliably), it's sometimes hard to sort out the coordinating instructions to enable trade natively in the game. We need to take trading out of discord chat and reddit messages and make it something that can function solely within the game.
---
&gt;Atomic Shop: Fixed an issue where some Atomic Shop content was missing sound effects.
---
&gt;Atomic Shop: “Waving Santa” sound effect will now only play when in “on” state.
---
For the love of GOD lower the music on this. It's bad enough it loads in late and I keep accidentally clicking it when "social" shifts down a row. 
---
I've reset my mutations twice because herd mentality still unshares cards randomly, even if base charisma is sufficient to share the card. 
---
Mostly agree. If a player purchased 5+ items that they didn't know were duped, they should not be banned IMO.
---
Couldnt agree more. ☺
---
Literally have smoked dope twice in my life, hated it both times, and stopped entirely. 
---
Proof positive Bethesda is making the community better by cracking down on duping.
---
I got mine through a mate who got it as a 2nd drop. I would still happily hand it over to see them all deleted.
---
Regardless of legitimacy they need to be dealt with. By balancing , deletion or another means.
---
Which there's no way to tell the difference between...
---
*AAA games
---
I feel like they aren’t going to allow multiple prefixes, as they are pretty powerful effects. Pretty sure Explosive should’ve been a prefix given how powerful it is. 
---
That is just the weight where you lose AP when running and can't fast travel.
---
Ya it's a glitch happens to me all the time. I just unzoom and it's works
---
Ah, Gotcha
---
What are the signs that you look for? I’d like to do my part in waylaying duper’s when I get the chance. 
---
repair cost scaling with level sounds stupid as hell, im almost lvl 200 so repairing would cost what 15+ items each category or something?
---
would the perk cards offset it decently enough? currently if i need to repair body armor with the perk card it only costs 1 of each item, but ofcourse ALL legendary armors seem to only be light or sturdy variants instead of heavy versions! so they are quite cheap
---
(im on ps4 so i wont see these changes for a short time)
---
Oh god yeah. Especially after thinking "wow, a Power Armour Chassis, what a shitty reward for completing the entire Brotherhood quest line" and scrapping it.
---
You people are possibly doing the best thing: enjoying the game without a single care about this bs and fake YouTube drama. That's how I enjoyed 4 abd that's how I wanted to enjoy 76 too, but oh well.
---
What do you mean by griefers? 
---
Thank you for this work. 
---
You say that like you know it to be true.
---
tHanKs fOr LiSTenInG. We are soooo thankful for that pile of hot garbage.
---
Next Time do it right from the get go.
---
How do we know it’s duped though? I have a friend who is level 330 and he had hundreds of every flux and bulk mat and tons of legendary weapons and armor on an alt mule that is thousands of pounds overencumbered. He got it all from queen farming. He’s never duped anything.
---
So you hope that duplicated weapons can be tracked and deleted, and you wanted to express that you don't care about anyone that was a recipient of those weapons.   
---
Thank you for your contribution.
---
I was AFC last night for two minutes, came back to some idiot hacking at me, I called out “stop being a bloody idiot “ gave him a angry and thumbs down emote and then fast travelled to my camp, no harm no fowl, but sheesh stop being total fuckwits!!
---
This community shares the stupid mentality of "HE HAS UNFAIRLY GAINED OP ITEMS BAN HIM" But please don't take away the items I bought from him I'm legit!!
---
That's cause your world revolves entirely around New Vegas. 
---
Why'd you have to use the word Decades man.... Now i'm in a midlife crises 
---
It's the Ol one two punch. Game is broken plus dupers exploiting broken game equals an even more broken game.
---
 You can have TSE weapons just fine. There's no problem with that. It's them being overpowered coupled with duping.
---
I find T60 pretty consistently in the Sons of Dane Compound by the Ammo Dump. 
---
Look into the Nuka Cola Plant. I saw some T-60 parts but didn't bother to pick them up as it required lvl 40 and I was level 20 at the time.
---
It's actually there. It's in the pic where they are acting like a band. It's on the far right side.
---
I don't know you, and I don't care to know you.
---
Sunshine oil is right in Flatwoods in Delbert's trailer.
---
You can learn mods from scrapping armour you've made, right? or does that only work for weapons?
---
Mainly trolls they camp low level people or will wreck peoples bases on the server. Just gotta get them fast though because normally when you go for them they leave server. If they are not able to block you in time you can follow them.
---
This is in response to the 30+ comments I've seen today from people saying "all dupes shouldn't be deleted" and that it isn't fair because they didn't do the duping, but they bought one that possibly could be. 
---
Well, you could try putting everything in your inventory into your stash or a container, and see if you still have any weight showing in your inventory?
---
This is clearly a reallt trolly post but in the off chance you just don't get it...
---
Yes Bethesda screwed up... And failed to do a better beta
---
Yes the made some fantastic PR blunders...
---
Yes they've dropped the ball on the promised transparent communication...
---
**But you know what they have done?**
---
Actually worked hard to fix stuff, in a reasonably timely matter, especially compared to other games and their update / patch history..
---
There are still tons to be fixed, FFS there are bugs from Fallout 4 we mod authors have had fixes for, for over 2 years that crept into this..... But they are actually listening and working on fixing this, rather than rolling under the **TrollTrain**(patient pending)  and throwing their hands up and walking away from it..
---
They have a long way to go, but they've also worked pretty hard at fixing some of the glaring issues they overlooked... 
---
If you don't love the game, or just have a hard on for trolling. Bethesda, more power to you, but go back to your echo chamber on Discord or another sub Reddit and let those of us enjoying the game, flaws and all, in peace.
---
I want a Mingo army!
---
I think the people that have been doing the dupes on TSE weapons are panic duping before the update 
---
I’m sure they’ll fix it at some point, but pipe guns are surprisingly powerful. Pipe bolt action has essentially identical stats to a hunting rifle. And before the last patch, you could actually get legendary pipe bolt actions, whereas you could get a legendary hunting rifle. 
---
The reason they are surprisingly powerful, is because if you put a stock on them, they simultaneously benefit from rifle and pistol based perks. Instead of the stock replacing its default pistol type, it just seems to add Rifle to its type list. So that’s all 3 pistol perks, all 3 rifle perks, and tank killer. Plus you can use the perk that lowers pistol weight to lower your pipe rifle weights. 
---
I’ve been wanting to make a build using a Pipe Revolver Rifle using those perks, since it’s the only revolver I can think of that can take a silencer. 
---
Of course, aesthetically, the pipe weapons look pretty awful. Every time I take one out, I want to take a screwdriver or hacksaw to the screws and other bits and bobs randomly sticking off stuff. 
---
I'm getting odd loading screens too. It's the area I'm going to load in to but it looks likes it's missing colors, print screen doesn't work so no pic. Also stuff just isn't loading in. There should be a Port-A-Diner [here](https://imgur.com/PBw1Jig) but it never loads in even after switch servers and a restart. At first I crawled inside hoping it would load in and I could get the pie but it never did. :(
---
Do optimized braces work?  
---
Jetpack is a QOL thing - one person might enjoy being able to jump over things or on top of things that others might need to go around.  
---
Does intel still add to XP gain?  
---
Calibrated is another QOL thing, some people might enjoy the AP or speed more.  
---
Like you said, it's your favorite combo. Not necessarily the "best."
---
War. War never changes.
---
I made 2 jokes about this comment
---
1. If you'r fingers fall off you will not be posting such comments
---
2. Sure, this blindfold will help for me not to see comments like yours.
---
I’ve got some stuff from duper’s and honestly? I don’t care if the couple weapons get taken away. The weapons I have are something to make the game easier (though not by much cause I end up shooting myself more than the enemies) and cooler but I wouldn’t rage quit and stop playing if it all disappeared. I’d just start grinding for shit again. I didn’t start playing for the guns and I’m not Gunna quit playing if they get taken away.
---
It's such a strange thing. There is no indication that they will be removed. Speculative complaints and anti-complaints! Ah well. Voices are never to be silenced...
---
I crashed a few times today on Xbox One, but I just tossed it up to the dupers going nuts before the patch fixes their money maker.
---
Tbh though, the amount of plastic you needed to scrap and bulk was pretty out there. Wasn't worth the effort really. 
---
Sorry man, I'm in the middle of one now too.. 
---
Well that sucks, Why do adults work. I can never have the perfect experience now
---
At the end of the day, I don't want these companies to go under, I want them to get better so yes I will praise them for doing the right thing even if it is just fixing their shit. If all we do is punish them for their screw ups and not praise them for fixing their mistakes the company will either go under or stop caring. 
---
I just have found using them to be difficult. About midway through fallout 4 I just found myself to uncomfortable with the sights and “feel” of them. It appears to be off center and wrong to me. Of course as soon as you add a scope that’s completely different but I guess my preference is prohibiting me from using them 
---
Didnt they say when they first announced the game that this is sort of what will happen in the end, as well as servers that you can "reserve" for you and your team?
---
Just discovered that r/FalloutRaiders  already exists thanks to the reply of r/TobiasWidower.
---
Right here. This is the problem. IT SHOULDN’T HAVE TO BE FIXED TO THE DEGREE IT NEEDED TO BE IN THE FIRST PLACE. The more people that just blindly accept that this is the norm, the more we will see it become the norm
---
You need a regular rad-x and some purified water. At ur chem station.
---
Quit crying got level up. It's a resource area quit bitchin
---
This and i just want to add none of were thrilled with release. But should we want our only Fallout game for the next 10 odd years to go under because of it?.
---
You turn normal Rad-x into diluted x2 at a chem station. I don't think you need to learn a recipe.
---
I can craft you one if you're on xb1
---
Straight up lying to your customers and not giving a flying fuck about what the condition of your product as soon as you put it up for sale. Sounds like a company that deserves to go under to me.
---
It won’t take you from Danger to Hidden, but it will make you lose Caution faster. If you can find Chameleon armor, it works much better with Healing Factor. I just found that out tonight. 
---
Did I say I preferred one over the other? I was just stating that this change is something that many have asked for. 
---
Tyler dirt track! Seriously in the forest, far edge of the map, no where near fissures. And it's been happening all over the forest these past few days. I didnt think they could even spawn in that zone. Did something break?
---
I'm "server not responding" the same as always.
---
On a side note for the love a little baby Jesus can you not make me not stand up when the server goes to not responding. You're making my stealth character not very stealthy.
---
Yeah, so you make your camp at nice location and some griefer just puts his camp at your doorstep with walls and guns pointed at you and you have no chance... Such features are beautifull, but in games, they are hard to implement because of such players who don't want to build or create something beautifull, they just use anonymity of internet and virtual worlds to destroy others creations, exploit system and bring hate and rage because they just can....
---
Delete all duped weapons and see what happens next fissure prime nuke.
---
-Spoiler-
---
Timer runs out and the cunt flies off before mutating
---
It’s a world of personality disorders.
---
&gt; , then continued to burn money on it
---
How is playing the game and trying to get your moneys worth out of it in playtime continued burning?  I think the game i a 2/10 and have over 100 hours
---
Andromeda was still a single player , classic bioware type experience. 
---
I've been an avid ME fan since one. Even as they ramped up the shootery-ness through 2 &amp;3. 
---
Andromeda was just so far below the bar of quality I came to expect from a ME game. 
---
F076 however is no more buggy than any other Bethesda release, I know what to expect, and didn't have a snap trade in causing bug for me like NV did. 
---
The major difference though was Andromeda was another ME game. Bethesda was wandering into new territory with the online service FO game. 
---
tedious childish gibberish. 
---
Choose your perk cards wisely. 
---
Scary ...
---
So every car company that's recalled a car should go under?
---
Wow!  Talk about high standards.
---
No indication indeed. Time will tell.
---
First - It is realy unlikely that my PC sucks, my PC is pretty decent and runs all new games perfectly at 40-60 FPS. Especialy graphics card (GTX 1060), which I bought few months ago. Second - no, I dont think this is my fault game has broken visual render. And third - game surely, looks gorgeous at sertain places, but other ones look horrible as hell.
---
I mean...kinda totally depends on what weapons you are talking about and what perks you have. Don't go and expect an unmodded weapon with no damage boosting perks to do much damage at all
---
New YouTube Headlines are gonna be: Bethesda Ruins Fallout 76 with patch removing duplication. 
---
Show us what you have.....
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
Thanks..im not even sure what perks to choose
---
You're on the right track, use the new bright lights and really look.
---
If the only options are go under or get better, in anything I will always choose get better, whether it is people, companies or governments. Yes they did some shitty things and saying something then is the right thing to do, but so is saying something when they do the right thing.
---
Not to mention 76 is no more buggy than any other Bethesda release 
---
People were only mildly irritated with bugs in New Vegas and Skyrim..... Some of which destroyed dozens of hours of game play either through causing you to forever lose every companion you had (NV) or full on corruption of save files (Skyrim)
---
Thanks 
---
Funny that was the general review I saw of Fallout 76
---
Yep. Lost my Furious Explosive combat rifle into the void. Not duped, not bought, looted from a kill. Occurred after DC'ing during an event.
---
Have you not seen the trend from nearly every Dev studio to work their employees to the bone and push out product that is rushed due to bean counters and stock holder pressure?
---
I'm not being an apologist, but Bethesda is in no way alone in these mistakes, spent a few minutes on google and you'll find some great and depressing articles on how bad it is to work in the video game Industry for a major game studio... 
---
Was I disappointed and a little disillusioned?
---
You better believe it, especially because I'm one of the fools that bought the PA edition from the Bethesda store (which is not part of Bethesda FFS... But it is part of Bethesda.. )
---
But the game was not even a fraction as flawed as talked about in most major publications, and the majority of the YouTube/Twitch streams / reviews were complete click bait nonsense...
---
im in
---
Yes but they are less common to learn
---
Decide what weapons you want to use
---
Melee or range
---
Ballistic vs engery vs plasma
---
Long range vs mid range vs close range
---
Pistol vs rifle vs shotgun vs heavy gun
---
Why were you non-plussed about no new content?
---
They were pretty Crystal clear about the next few updates and which ones will contain what. 
---
High standards to expect something I payed to work, and when it doesn’t I get treated properly as a customer? I know, so outlandish!
---
People who activate the final part of a certain quest and then run away can cause aggro gutsies to descend on unsuspecting visitors.
---
I hate that, too. I have to ration space for materials so each type has to stay at a certain number so my stash isn't constantly full. I go too far over, guess I need to sell the damn springs/gears/ballistic fiber. 
---
I see your point, I'm biased because I have such a great time.
---
I'm probably 200 hours in so far, no end in sight. I'm only pissed when I'm in a great zone and my game crashes... Today I downed 6 Legendary bloaties in a Nuke Zone and before I could loot, poof. Crash.
---
Ack! Eh oh well, probably a stupid 1* whatever anyway. Proceeds to reload and continue for hours. 
---
At this point I don't care, I love this game so much, and will stomach all the bullshit issues so long as I can keep playing and grinding away.
---
Unless this fix is related to something else they fixed, it got missed.
---
You're lucky OP. I go through there quite a bit and it's sometimes full of level 20-ish SM due to spawn mechanics, and there's often no legendary there.  
---
Yeah I saw that, but when were they put in? The week or two after launch? Last few weeks? How do you know how many hours you have in this game anyway? 
---
&gt; Go down the mutation route instead.
---
I run both.  It's nice.
---
Depends on where. I defended someone's workshop near Flatwoods against 2x10 lvl 52 Mayor Gutsy's, the ones that shoot you with armor-piercing bullets. Normally I'd whip out my explosive weapon(s) but I couldn't as it could have damaged the player's stuff there. Had to melee them down one by one.
---
I have a lvl 15 dual barrel shotgun ghoul slayer with explosive.  Picked it up from I can't remember what the event was.  It comes in handy when needed but I don't bring that out unless it's just the wife &amp; I are taking on something big. Or the other night where we fought a 61 Hermit Crab followed by a 70ish Deathclaw &amp; then a 80 SB. 
---
We join in at Whitesprings and use whatever melee we have or pick up on the way. 
---
Complete clickbait nonsense...my God. If you didn’t want to sound like an apologist, you sure do now.
---
So a dev is working their employees to the bone and they still produce a garbage product? Sounds like the perfect company to hope that they go under.
---
Ahhhhhh, I've seen them there but figured it was a spawn bug. Bastards... lol 
---
I've been above that sense beta. 200% is like hobbyist hoarder level. Dupers probably make up like .01% of the people at that weight limit. 
---
I often scrap worthless mods that I won't use
---
If that was real it would be "I.O.U 1 star wooden leg".
---
Thanks that was insightful
---
nah, if I'm cruising Whitesprings and your 15 rockets start staggering my screen, I'm shooting them down. Tryna listen to the radio in peace) 
---
Ok I'll give it a go thanks
---
They don't tell people if they're on to them, that tends to make people more careful ;-)
---
Flawed premise...
---
If they didn't care, they would not be working on patches or fixing stability issues, from day 1..
---
(IMHO) They had closed BETA without any real experienced "outside the box" thinkers trying to break the game and min-max / exploit the hell out of it... Should have, could have.. But that is water under the bridge..
---
I had half a dozen issues reported in my first couple days of the BETA, including an net gain endless XP cycle, but I knew what to look for, as a vet of MMO's..
---
If they keep fixing and improving I'll be happy, and I'll keep enjoying the wasteland, and the community building..
---
And hell, guess what?
---
Since they had such a rough patch here...
---
Maybe, just maybe, it means they'll learn something from this expensive blunder, and the next game will gain from it...
---
And I'd rather have that, then a shuttered studio, due to trolls like you.
---
when you scrap all junk does it scrap your bulk items? because i don't like that
---
Well, then we'll simply make a Hulk.
---
Thanks for mention that.
---
You have to take the stats out of the workbench, not from the craftet ones, as they can roll higher stats with rising intelligence. That's why your stats are different.  
---
So ie you go to workbench --&gt; heavy --&gt; metall --&gt; 'mouseover' on lvl 50 --&gt; write down stats.  
---
if you want to have the effects of the mods you gonna craft/ use an armor to modify and 'mouseover' on the mods and have to calculate the difference yourself. As they also can roll higher I assume.  
---
I'll take a note in the post.  
---
Using any mods?
---
Fair. 
---
I’ll offer this though: 
---
Fortnite is a simple game, appealing to one primary audience who enjoy it in largely the same way. 
---
Fallout/Elder Scrolls games simultaneously appeal to many audiences that enjoy entirely different things about them. There’s people who take in the scenery and collect flowers, people who min-max the combat mechanics, people who explore every bit of plot line possible, people who build houses/camps/settlements etc. there’s even people who will enjoy new things the titles past and present don’t have but future ones will (which is where F76, that offers a different genre, comes in). 
---
Where I’m getting at is that in such a complex game system, with so many inter-depending mechanics and subsystems that various audiences form a connection with and find meaning in spending their time on, converting from an old model “we know what’s good for you, let us design a game and present it to you with a big ta-daaa!!” to a new model of “we’ve decided to include you in the design process early on, and retain major development deep into the product cycle, based heavily on feedback you provide, even as you, the user, are playing it” is a model that, in my view, has the potential to take an already deep, complex system evolved over 6 major creation engine titles and make it a whole new flavor of awesome. 
---
Where do you find this stuff at? That outfit looks like itd go great with the cultists mask
---
&gt; the gat wrecks shit better.
---
true dat
---
I’d rather have a studio that doesn’t have the nerve to release this type of shite in the first place. It’s okay though, can’t blame the sheep for defending their Shepard
---
I more or less soloed it with a two shot .50 cal machine gun in ~15 minutes. Maybe shes bugged and explosive weapons are just slaps for her now.
---
Yeah they can take the most extreme cases, but they have to be careful to not ban innocent people.. 
---
Not just the mentor, but also the womentor and the childrentor 
---
I now have the Ghoulish Perk (radiation heals), no Stims needed, just Radaway and Rad-X.  
---
Actually, I was in a Nuke Zone today at White Springs (PS4, level 70) but joined a bit late.  At one point the glowing ones came out and I was the only one near the country club.  Had to take the mob down all down by myself, sweating to death in my T-60 Power Armour, swinging my supersledge for all it's worth.  No good drops, though, just lots of XP.  Went up two levels for about an hour's worth of game play until I ran out of Radaway.
---
Spent the rest of the night hunting down Radaway and junk items (springs) to repair my weapons...  
---
Love it, where do you get the neon letters from?
---
Lol...
---
Not at all, the point is Bethesda is not alone in making mistakes, and providing some examples of it doesn't make me an apologists, it's called perspective..
---
And the transmentor and gaytor
---
unless its a rarer mat i feel selling is better.
---
Cool im in and i can craft you good weapons and armor if you want. Im probably going to be playing some 10 hours from this comment. And i will play all of saturday aswell.
---
Eh, if you have the recipe and traveling pharmacy, 100 serumis just an easy way to carry instant caps.
---
Tesla Rifle is very durable its the only energy weapon that doesnt suffer from the fracked durability.
---
&gt; putting everything in your inventory into your stash
---
Hahahahhaahhaahhahhaahhahhhahhaahahaahahhaahhahahaha
---
 Your method is actually the exact reason i took an acid pool for my base, and consistently hit lode bearing or beach and clear, ore for days, smelting it down gives xp, materials, and gold and silver scrap to sell. 
---
make sure you have perk cards that go well with what kind of weapons you wanna stick with. 
---
I won't be dropping anything, I'll be selling to vendors if nobody wants it or scrapping. I don't think you read my last paragraph, it's not for someone in your position with multiple play-throughs. I assume by "junk" you mean actual junk, and that goes on my stoop along with the crops and ammo for passers by. 
---
I think you and I play very similarly, but some people in different circumstances simply don't get the time to "actually forage the wastes...etc".
---
r/accidentalwarhammer
---
The bees and honey haven't been spawning since I moved my camp to have them within it. I think you need to leave them outside of the circle of your camp then the bees and honey will spawn but I'm not sure. Maybe I will test it with my other character to be sure.
---
Damn thanks il pm you right away
---
Yeah think i might have chooesen wrong then...
---
what kind of weapons do you prefer? i could help you out
---
A park. With a few shitty attractions. And scorched. And my previous C.A.M.P., but now I'm happy I changed :[ 
---
Are you stupid? Ammosmith + Superduper and you can have all the ammo you need for fairly low mats. I used TSE .50 cal and with those 2 perks alone and around 200 steel, which you can get in minutes, and a couple gunpowder you can get close to 1k rounds let alone if you actually farm for like an hour which you could easily get close to 10k rounds or pretty close to it which will last you a few days normally and thats if you are only using that weapon. Almost eveyone uses gunsmith 5 for 50% slower breaking and i just swap perks to repair to 200% and that lasts almost all day (around 12 hours of playing) without breaking once. On top of that you can use the perk for a chance to greatly repair your weapon every shot you take. Heavy weapons and melee are the only 2 ver "effective" builds for SBQ. If anything rifles cost more than heavy guns because the only decent rifle outside of gauss is the handmade and 5.56 ammo is expensive and its runs through it fast.
---
love how the argument from the trolls went from "bethesda arent doing jackshit and ur defending them, ur the problem" to "bethesda are fixing shit and ur defending them, ur the problem". Nothing but an immature post from a edgy pre-teen.
---
Trapper has built-in rad resistance and its arms and legs (with buttressed) are the highest RR in the game (particularly if you found a specimen with a legendary +25RR effect). 
---
It’s torso has nerfed rad resistance and you’ll want to couple your rad trapper limbs to a marine armor torso for best RR. 
---
The DR/ER on them are not shabby either. 
---
The other two advantages (of both trapper and marine) are the material-cheap repairs and the no-exotics crafting of the lowest tier, allowing you to craft (a relative) lot and scrap them to learn the plans. 
---
Visit the grafton high school sports hall for heaps of rubber and collect all the cigarettes you can for asbestos ;)
---
Met 3 of these asses tonight. Just went from one of our workshops to another to another destroying them. (We had three on a fairly empty server)
---
They used mini nukes and grenades and then blocked us or something so we couldn't see them on the map. We killed them over and over but they just would not stop. 
---
I get that people are bored but jesus how annoying. 
---
PSN: Grendalzzz
---
I usually use my friends list to server hop so at some point I'll probably pop by to say hello:) also feel free to pop me a message on PSN if you need help with anything I'm always happy to help!
---
No, you calling multiple game breaking bugs clickbait nonsense makes you an apologist. And I never said Bethesda was alone. And I’ve never heard of a company pulling this type of crap, at least one that’s still in business.
---
I agree, but having spent an insane amount of time playing the game over the last couple months due to an injury, and literally not vendoring a single bobble head, legendary etc item for nearly 300 levels I think it's reasonable to say it would be impossible to have 100,000 Bobbleheads or 1,000 of some of the mags...
---
At one point I had more than 3,000 legendary armor pieces in on mules inventory and less than 5 of them "stacked"
---
Shotgun, pistol, revolver and hunting rifle and sniper rifle. Prefer my sword and hammer aswell sometimes
---
Tesla Rifle can also arc across entire groups of enemies its nice for ghouls and scorched.
---
Not all superheroes wear capes. The fallout 76 shills can bitch and downvote all they like but the overruling factor in all of this is that fallout 76 bombed. From what could have been a good game which shows some potential.. the reality is much different. And nothing hurts bethesda more than people not forking out money for a sup par product. 
---
Hopefully this whole saga is a lesson to other developers who think they can churn out shit and get away with it.
---
You are delusional if you think this. The majority are just playing the game normally.
---
This is what it's all about brother.  Without conflict, action games get really damn boring.
---
John Denver was a boring musician. Fans like to describe it as a euphemism , "Pastoral". 
---
Charlie Rich knew it. 
---
Luck of the draw not working on tier 2 is still bugged, aka not working at all. 
---
I think it's more like less than 1%. Even people on this forum are a minority. Most people are just casual gamers.
---
Indeed hopefully it will die down abit when vaults release. Until then we get very heavy handed with them especially with low level players. Rather not see people turned off 76 because some asshat made their life a living hell and we don't have a pvp/pve server choice.
---
I too did this, my best guess is that it changed the display correctly but doesn't actually change the amount of damage when your using it.
---
I play around 6am-11am est unless I'm off work then I'm on at night, not sure when you're on usually but add me Lurchie330 I can always help out with supplies and what not
---
Same for me but I thought it was a bug. Lever action just keeps getting better.
---
ah well shotgun and melee are all under strength, even with 15 strength u can’t have both max shotgunner and max melee. you’d have to go with one. 
---
i’d recommend sticking with one gun type, and a melee weapon for when u don’t wanna waste ammo on lesser foes. 
---
it seems your problem is trying to do several builds at once. 
---
The raider excuse is lame the raiders are focusing on survival by taking goods from others not scorched earth. There would be nothing for them. They usually form their own damn groups.. just listen to some of their holotapes you’ll get the idea. The current raider role play is piss poor at best.
---
I feel the same way, I'm 85 and never get any good drops.
---
You may have to wait a bit before you can use it as it's a 25. The other larger ones are 15-25 also. The smaller stuff I have is like 5-20.
---
I'll be on tonight anyway, about 2100 UK time.
---
Wich one do u think is the better 1
---
They could also be lying too.
---
I don’t know what people were complaining about before, but it was probably valid. You’re a fucking idiot for defending this type of business practice, where you sell half a product, basically as a server test, just so that you can slowly fix it overtime and have the basement dwelling morons that are your fans call it “listening”
---
really? it lets me shoot them
---
There's things that aren't shown on the map. 
---
Also, there's random events happening here and there under certain conditions.
---
I'm level 84 and still haven't gone to certains spots because I had other things to do first in game, and haven't fully explored some others. 
---
And in a few weeks I guess we'll have our lovely faction mode &lt;3
---
What level are you ? Maybe get ammo Smith perk.
---
Get your flux on!
---
You dont think the hundreds of "I suddenly lost my weapon, what bug is this???" would hurt the game from random people who doesnt know that their weapon was duped?
---
I will agree with this. It's a nice painted picture.
---
Then I remember it's in the US. 
---
No offence to individual Americans, but as a Canadian I haven't and won't step foot in your country for a long time. 
---
Too bad too. The US has some of the most stunning and iconic nature and landscape in North America. 
---

---
Drop stuff buddy or use a bank alt.
---
My mistake, I meant time, not money. 
---
You already made the mistake of buying it, at least that’s what it sounds like to me. Why waste more time on it? There’s plenty of other games out there, fuck playing 76 if you don’t like it. I think you’re in the minority. Not many people will say ‘eh I hate this game but imma keep playing it because I bought it.’ 
---
Last time I accepted a team invite at the queen event, it was a level 15 player who wanted the teleport-to-teammate. I now only accept team invites from someone that I can actually see near me.

---
I manage at around 180/240lbs prior to looting whatever junk I need, with a selection of 6 weapons. 
---
Owning a workshop puts you in pvp pacifist or not.
---
Oh so that's what happened. In that case it feels intended, not that i approve.
---
I'm assuming something is wrong with how they spawn. There has been multiple times that Ill just be wandering around and poof theres 3-4 of them flying over my head. They don't do shit for damage but 1 of them constantly screeching is annoying enough let alone 4 making it so i cant see a fucking thing.
---
This is one of the most useless change they could have done.
---
I don't understand why you would need more than 10 Bobby Pins on you. There's no point to hoard it at all.
---
Yeah stacking legendary weapons is a huge giveaway that it was duped, because there is allmost no way of doing that no matter how you play (extremely rare)  
---
No legitimate player will have 5 stacked of a good weapon or 1000 of the same bubblehead. 
---
So glad that they are still going strong with the fixes in this game.
---
Well, I did like the fusion core refill...
---
Well I drop a minimum of 3 nukes a day so itis 100 just clearing the silo 4-8 tech data at 25 each but that depends on events in that area. Then taking all the workshops which is weird as I have gotten anywhere from 15 caps to 900 caps for taking one. Not entirely sure what that trigger is but I don't complain when it is over 100. 
---
Basically all I do right now is events and check for plans. 
---
Fall into a unltracite pit
---
Shhh, you said something bad about something they bought
---
You craft a ton of guns and scrap them for the chance to learn new mods
---
One bug that happens to me from time to time is when I fast travel and it's loading in the sound cuts out completely and the screen is black but the hud is still there. Happens regularly jumping to Harper's Ferry.
---
Yeah, powering up poisedion crashed my game right when I was about to make the final repairs. 
---
I’ve got a double shot Gauss I’d be willing to part with.
---
Fireproof+Explosive Legendaries=Amazing 
---
I have 4 different TSE weapons:
---
- Lever action rifle that I changed at the very begin of the game for the prime receiver of the pump shotgun, a very rare plan dropped from the queen on the first week after the Beta. A fair trade
---
- Gatling gun that I changed for a antiarmor+explosive shotgun. A fair trade
---
-Western revolver that I bought for 14.000 caps, ALL the caps that I saved fron playing everyday for 2 months. A fair trade
---
- Gauss rifle dropped to me by a legendary ghoul in the middle of nowhere, just travelling and enjoying going around the map clearing locations (I hate farming a spot)
---
Now tellme that any of my weapons should be removed. I don't know if the first 3 are dupped or not, probably yes cause now I see them on the f76 market for 3-5kcaps.
---
To add
---
Manage yourself
---
▪Excavator armor plus shocks is a bonus 200 
---
weight. Or any PA with shocks for 100.
---
▪Stash 600
---
▪ Perks like Junk Rat very key perks for a heavy user like yourself.
---
▪ Strength increases weight limit each point.
---
I don't know if anyone has suggested this, but maybe we could name them. 
---
300-400 over? What the fuck game are you playing? Damn 
---
I absolutely love Fallout 76. I think the game is great. The map is well-designed and I’m excited to see what happens with the story. I am level 67 and I have easily gotten my money’s worth out of it. I’m just sick of the hate train that makes its rounds far too often. 
---
Did a couple last night, was fine.. Not saying people dont have issues, but it's not everyone..
---
i personally would go with shotguns, and just have an offhand melee weapon to get lower levels. if you have a good melee weapon you can go without the perks for them. but if you prefer melee, you can do all the one handed or two handed perks, and still be able to do the rifle perks under perception. or pistol, under agility. but i recommend the first two (shotguns &amp;melee offhand, or melee and rifle) 
---
i have two characters, one is shotgun with offhand melee, the other is melee with rifles. they’re pretty reliable. once u get your perks worked out though, you’ll be doing some good damage. 
---
So we almost have a working skeleton of a game. Now we only need content
---
Kill level 1 scorch people.
---
They drop a hand full rounds of ammo and if you have the ammo search perk you get more.
---
I will also like to add.
---
▪ Bulk your junk.
---
▪ Keep only 500 of any given junk type you should not need more than that. Bulk the rest and sell it to vendors.
---
▪ Don't pick up missles or Nukes and don't keep ammo you don't use.
---
Are you kidding?
---
There are Wikipedia articles on the history of duping in MMO's.. None of this is new or exclusive to Bethesda.
---
UO, EQ, WoW (I Beta'ed and played nearly every MMO released in the English language until WoW) etc etc all had as rocky, if not rockier launches, the WoW servers for example could barely stay up the first few weeks, with massive latency / lag issues and constant server rollbacks..
---
Bethesda didn't spend enough time learning from others mistakes, without question...
---
But back to the "clickbait".. The majority of them were nonsense, many being factually inaccurate in almost their entirety..
---
Just like the "there is no encryption" nonsense that got passed around Reddit, YouTube and even "reputable" gaming news sites for FFS... Was complete and utterly false.
---
It's worth crafting your own so you can then scrap a bunch of it, thus learning mods which you can apply to the legendary versions you find in your adventures. 
---
does it make u feel better to try insult randoms on the internet? dont worry when u grow up u'll learn there are better things u can do with ur life.
---
What weapon?
---
As I said, it is possible, but only with insane grinding and then only infrequently..
---
But if all they did was flag those account to be inspected they would likely catch a huge chunk of the dupers..
---
Yea. 3650 to be exact.I waste like 20 to 30 on a 3 star lock and im a hoarder.
---
all fun and game till it does that while ur wearing only the top half. then you just look like a walking trashcan. 
---
That's just the shared inventory showing, the true inventory was still loading.
---
I regularly dump everything and build a loadout from scratch with just what I actually need. I usually take 3-4 weapons including a melee, a few throwables, food and water, and a hand full of the important chems. I can sometimes be out the door under 120lbs if I know I'm just going on a quick run.
---
don’t carry so much 
---
Agreed! It's nice to see them performing the tasks we would like to see them performing. I am satisfied by their efforts, and would like to encourage them to continue to do so through this praise. You and I are of one mind on this topic! 
---
Take only what you need, you dont need 1000 bobby pins, or 500 stimpaks. or 200 legendary weapons you may never ever use. Im generally always around 180/230 weight, and about 450/600 stash, and I do have about 10 weapons stored there now, mainly quest rewards and a couple of legendaries and a shit tonne of outfits. I only collect the resources I need to repair armor/weapons, and build up my C.A.M.P and basically just leave everything else
---
Hiker is an amazing perk to use as well it reduces all food and water weight to almost nothing.
---
Well that's justified! One time there was a lvl 18 that placed it outside during a nukeparty... I wanted to smash it so bad, i think in the end we where four three-digit people just staring him down in his home while he threw emote after emote.
---
I think next time things will be different.
---
&gt; They aren't saints for fixing a game that was marketed as something else entirely. 
---
What was it marketed as? This seems to me to be exactly the game I expected it to be given everything we were presented with before launch. 
---
no problem, if u still need some help shoot me a message. i could even get the perk stats for my character you can look at if you want
---
Items in your stash DO NOT benefit from your perk cards therefore it is more efficient to store things like heavy weapons and Chen’s in your inventory because there are perks that reduce weight by 90% fusion cores also weigh a lot without batteries included and explosive weight is ridiculous, it entirely depends on the build you are using, it is better to use the weight reduction perk cards than rank 3/4 in strong back, you should only really be carrying 3-4 weapons tops and power armour is waaaaay lighter than regular armour anyway, also SCRAP AND BULK that can save a lot of weight for materials that you have a lot of. If none of these tips help I don’t know what else you can do. 
---
My username is "Matiasmatizer" for anyone that wants to add me and play
---
Shoot me your PSN. I'll add you. 
---
I've got a water and junk farm. Useful at lower levels. 
---
I've got an alt near your level so we can trip around, answer questions etc. 
---
They nees to fix the whole fucking game not just some parts because I can't walk for 5 minutes without encountering a bug.
---
i was in the middle of buttfuck nowhere, near vault 76, alright gotta piss. should be safe i’m level 190, no scorchbeasts are gonna wreck my shit. 
---
i’m gone 5 minutes and come back to a level 80 scorchbeast tearing me a new one. like what the actual fuck are you doing here fam?? 
---
Just disband all criticism as clickbait, I’m sure that will prolong your enjoyment of this buggy mess that was sold for $60 at launch. And I haven’t mentioned their damn PR department, which is the absolute worst part of this. But go ahead, go back to your swamp of a game, convince yourself that you made a wise purchase because the game will be updated slowly over time to what it should have been
---
It's supposed to be rough in the beginning and Legendaries are supposed to be rare..
---
Seen that it's now modified by your rifle perks, I'd say ballistic.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
There is a bug or exploit that lets you stack up damage. With this people are reaching damages in the tens of thousands. That will let them kill people with just "slap" damage.
---
Hello and thanks.
---
My username is "Matiasmatizer"
---
There are perk cards to fix that
---
Be on in 5
---
Please tell me you have pictures.
---
Thanks bro will do so
---
Are you not using class freak perk?
---
Don't look at them as griefers, look at them as Raiders. Welcome to the wasteland. 
---
Not at all....
---
Just the majority, just like you and this thread..
---
Click bait trolling at its finest.
---
The renovations are done. They just need a state inspector to sign off on them being up to code. Time for another trip to Charleston. 
---
How much food &amp; water &amp; chems do you carry?
---
You playing right now?
---
i don’t but it happened to this youtuber i am gonna link the video. 
---
https://youtu.be/BH57FSOM_2w
---
Try to get a 'good' low level melee weapon like the fire axe ( i still use it at lvl 30 tbh xd its good for one shotting low level melee enemies)  
---
And tag search for lead, you need alot and then you can craft ammo
---
Class Freak, and lose/gain until you kill off egg head, empath (not helped by class freak), and herd mentality.
---
I'm max in all gladiator perks and other melee damage perks. I wanted mid range though.
---
Chems i sell don't use them. But food and water crazy amounts but hiker takes almost all their weight away.
---
I've never not enjoyed the game. It's always been fun. If it's getting even better, then I continue to be pleased by that. It's been a bit buggy, but not so much as to prevent me from enjoying it. I'll keep on enjoying it. That's all that I really ask of a game. 
---
Lmao, just proving my previous comment to be accurate. Bye
---
This. Fallout is not like other instant gratification fps OP is probably used to.
---
Its about the journey not the destination.
---
&gt; You shouldn't have to thank them for doing something they should have done at the beginning.
---
No, but it's polite to do so.
---
Boring troll.
---
That's annoying, I'll try without the martial artist perk
---
Sure fact you've resorted to personal attacks means you've not only failed but tipped your hand completely..
---
Go back to your cave..
---
Drop everything you have in your inventory including weapons and armor, which should put you at 0. However, if you still have weight, then there are invisible things in your inventory. This is helpful anyway to recognize how much certain things weigh, but I have yet to have a character affected by this.
---
NOTE: please be careful when you drop your stuff to prevent the loss of quest items and your stuff in general. I recommend using your stash or first dropping something worthless like wood or steel scrap to create the bag, then transfer everything into the bag.
---
OMG I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL!! I've got a few 3* legendaries but they're not real popular among the community here. So all I can do is just wait until someone offers me one I suppose. 
---
&gt; nearly unplayable
---
I've played it every day since launch. There's been bugs, but nothing which has prevented me from enjoying it. 
---
You need the plans to craft regular rad-x and there are no plans for any of the diluted stuff you can just craft it anyway, there is actually a better version of rad x you find in a quest in the mire tho...
---
I would get it, but I just bought a two shot gauss today for 500 caps. 
---
No power armour or heavy guns. I don't know why but I detest how clunky they both are. And I don't mind between ballistic and energy. What are the benefits of a pistol? It just seems like less damage and range but I'm sure there are advantages.
---
I have an Automatic Laser, It lasts a good while.  But I have maxed out the Weapon Artisan perk  so I can repair it to 200%.  I also have the Gunsmith perk maxed out (slows breakage).  
---
I find that it's great for robots and it now lasts long enough to go through an area like Watoga, if fully repaired, before breaking. 
---
Bethesda pls import this into 4
---
&gt; Keep only 500 of any given junk type you should not need more than that. Bulk the rest and sell it to vendors.
---
you must mean 50....
---
no mags at all for leveractions
---
Nope, but I'll be playing tomorrow from 3pm to 6pm ish and then from 9pm to 2 am cst.
---
I live in mexico city, I think the time is the same as in Florida but just for reference its 2:23 rn
---
Man good to know you know the inner workings of Bethesda. Does Todd get his own office? 
---
Bethesda is arguably one of the more reasonable when it comes to micro transactions.
---
Games featuring loot crates are significantly worse. Essentially illegal gambling.
---
And as for being thankful for bug fixes? Yes. I should just be super angry and passive aggresively gay bash people like you are because they are fixing issues in a game I enjoy. 
---
Not just fixing issues, but clearly prioritizing fixes largely requested by the community. 
---
Uh huh.
---
I regret not going slower in the beginning TBH, am 300+ with great (I refuse to use TSE's) gear and throttle myself now to make it more enjoyable..
---
He's talking about grenade launchers, grenades, mines and so on. The rest of the explosive weapons are also 100% negated with this perk and dense mods.
---
No that's a general weapons bug. The lever action glitch was the animation would load 5 rounds regardless of how many were actually needed to reload.
---
Best gun I had until lvl 57 done damage of 160 ish , best melee was 180 ish .
---
Bought my first TSE from here with perk cards does 965 DMG.
---
allowed me to go up against anything in the game and now I grind whitesprings launch two nukes per day and always always do Uranium fever events and i swimming in legendaries.
---
I dump a stupid amount of armour and guns and melee weapons  ranging from 1* to 3* in the sack next to the tinker table at whitesprings or overseers chest in fallwoods.
---
So I feel your pain but everything changed once I had one decent gun.
---
* Fell like sticking a gun sale advert down here for a laugh 😉
---
Well now I'm going to have nightmares tonight, so thanks for that.
---
Spawn regularly on PA frames for me.
---
1. Fixes that shouldn’t have needed to be made in the first place.
---
2. Micro transactions that used to be in game content.
---
In case you didn’t understand that, I’ll put it in your terms,
---
1. Baaaahhh
---
2. Baaaaaaaahhhh
---
I have the perks Bear Arms, Martial Artist, Travelling Pharmacy, Sturdy Frame, Strong Back, Thru Hiker, Portable Power equipped. I had to drink dirty water to get below 20% health, equipped Radicool for +5 strength, equipped Solar Powered for +1 (only have rank 1 so far, other priorities), equipped Party Girl (only have rank 1 so far) and drank some alcohol for +4, took some Rad-X to suppress my Healing Factor and took some Bufftats for +3, equipped my Black Diamond for +1, and I have Motion-Assist servos and Calibrated Shocks on my Excavator for 210, and then I was able to fast travel. 
---
I have I think 8 of them. If you choose the right combo for your build and use the perks properly they are amazing. 
---
bro out here lookin like someone stuck two toothpicks in a marshmallow. 
---
Thats taking it a tad low but sure if you find yourself not using much.
---
 Baffles me how this hasn’t been the case since the start since it is essentially what this whole game’s plot revolves around 
---
CwAP CwAP 
---
Ok, I don't know da bell reference... Please enlighten
---
CwAP CwAP
---
I use the level action all the time and have not come across that one yet. Most people are referring to reloading and how even if you only need to reload one bullet, the full animation would play to reload all five rounds rather than something like the pump action shotgun. Now that it's been "fixed" however, the gun might be needing a Nerf whenever the great balance patch comes around as it was still very usable before and has a super snappy reload even for all five rounds now (could just be my imagination though).
---
Did you just ask a stranger to show you his weapon?
---
You're for the watching 😶
---
You can't fit 500 of each widely used junk in the stash....
---
Oh you must be a cleanprincegaming fan. 
---
The guy thinks he's the Messiah of gamers 
---
"WE DONT NEED TO ACCEPT THIS! STOP PRE ORDERING! THE INDUSTRY WILL GET THE MESSAGE"
---
No. No they will not. The gaming industry is huge, and is beholden to the cult of the new. You actually think your outrage will accomplish anything? It won't. 
---
Less finished games are the new norm. Just accept it. It's never going to change. 
---
I swear the game throws them at you when you are doing ace, i.e. have that rare junk maxed out.
---
Hate micro transactions TBH, I think it's a slippery slope, and would rather not see them..
---
But....
---
Considering Silent Hill (FFS) is even going to have micro transactions I'm not sure it's completely avoidable now, sans a revolution.
---
Oh sorry, ps4
---
You'd think they wouldn't need all those notepads with all those computers lying around but what do I know?
---
Nah, he’s in the thick of things, making things JUST WORK
---
I know which ones are. The problem is that I don't know which ones are which.
---
*cries in quad lever action*
---
Both groups of these people can exist simultaneously. 
---
Lmao
---
Hasnt ever been fixed. It seems this patch made it occur without having to do much beyond some similar things.
---
What this guy writes. I am lvl 230 now. Had rifle build up to around lvl 160. Respecc to heavy around that point because i wanted to try something else.
---
I have 15 str, 14 luck, 15 int and 5 in P for granadier and glowing perk, 1 in End and 5 in charisma. I wreck the Queen with TS gatling and 50 cal as well as the adds with explosive 50 cal. TSE 5 cal is nice but i was doing fine with normal explosive too.
---
Ammo was an issue at the start. Now i do farm the penetentiary once in a while and craft with ammosmith and super duper.
---
Running with gatling and 50 cal makes ammo not a problem really. Also have prime receiver as an option but not needed for current content imo.
---
Bonus: I can swap to full melee in seconds and smack the face of anything. Just wished i had a perk swap Addon 😂.
---
Happy hunting
---
You only get good stuff if you decrypt the nuke codes yourself.
---
Honestly, I keep mine low since I can sell off all the crap to vendors before they run out of money. Why sell 200 caps worth off one weapon you don't use when you can sell 8? Clears out your inventory faster. 
---
Not making it up because he literally messaged me afterwards gloating not to mess with an “elite” player with a TSE 50 cal machine gun.
---
Can we start banning people for throwing a fucking fit against someone who is just trying to share their opinion? Maybe you should stop assuming people are making shit up first buddy. 
---
You a lucky boi... or girl.
---
Serious note you finished the BoS main quest.
---
Interesting. Is that confirmed?
---
This same tired argument? Try again
---
A hidden fix is that the Lever Action reload wasn't being affected by Speed Demon mutation, now it is.
---
They can't even do anything involving player accounts, so how would they be able to tell if an item is duped or not?
---
Yes, because all usernames represent who they are a fan of on YT
---
Also, who?
---
Get recipe, eat serum every hour. Problem fixed.
---
Can't help you personally, but the Scorched occasionally drop 10mm pistols. If you're below level 20, Poseidon is a good place to farm lower leveled  (5 to 10) Scorched for scrapping those pistols to learn the mod. Alternatively, the Vendors in Watoga and Harper's Ferry have plenty of weapon mods and plans for said mods, so if you're higher level you can seek them out.
---
I do have one but don't use it its lower level. Forgot to try it out to watch it do a full reload since the change.
---
Fixes that shouldn't have been needed in the first place?
---
Name one game that launched with zero bugs.
---
Which micro transactions used to be fo76 in game content? 
---
You call me a sheep? You think you're some original, thinks for themselves, righteous crusader because you think games should be more polished at launch ?
---
And troll while doing it?
---
You're nothing. You're a parrot. You're the sheep. A naive, naive sheep. 
---
You blindly believe some BS that people fed you about changing the industry, voting with your wallet, blah blah blah. 
---
Won't happen. Ever. Sorry sheep. You fell for the BS. 
---
True true.
---
In the Challenges page there is a challenge to play 76 hours of Fallout 76. Once you have that it flips to 7600 hours but it keeps a running tally. 
---
Remember, not everyone glitches through the ceiling of the silo, walks a tightrope skipping 3/4ths of the event and then uses nothing but min-maxed TSE or Bloodied builds to kill to Queen, some of us like enjoying the game..
---
Because that's the only way to do the Queen 23 times in one day, coming from a level 300+ who's killed her "a few times"
---
I've experimented with them, but they don't proc that often on semi-auto rifles.  My Luck tree is pretty tied up with essentials, but I have some flexibility in Int and Ag.  With Gunsmith 3 and White Knight 2, I'll have to fix a piece of armor maybe once a week, and a gun once every other day if I engage in a blast zone on a daily basis.  I swap in Fix It Good and Weapon Artisan when repairing so gear is at 200% condition, and I usually wait until they get to 50% before repairing.  Given how rarely I have to fix armor at level 100+, I may drop down to White Knight 1 and Add Thru-Hiker 1 to lighten my food and drink weight.
---
On your person using Junk Rat. Your stash is very limited in space.
---
Unless you work for Bethesda then you will never know.
---
Thats why whenever I see *fix for X post I just lol and roll the eyes.
---
Unless you know the inner workings of the source code its mere speculation.
---
Ah thanks. No idea why I had it 
---
Not really. They’ve fixed the method but done nothing to deter the players from doing other bs.
---
And afaik its the only one in game.
---
Yeah that griefer's CAMP would immediately meet my Fatman (you don't want to meet him he's really mean spirited). If he really pisses me a good old Orbital Strike.
---
I would say it's his CAMP that has "no chance".
---
Ya, one the smoothest multiplayer survial games on release I ever played, and that isn't factoring in the massive amount of content comparatively. I am far from saying it didn't need some love, but if you are a fan of the genre, your kidding yourself if you think this was anything close to the unplayable mess others make it out to be. There is an area between blind fan boy and beliveing the game was trash on release. 
---
I was very pleased with the update.  Server stability seems to be much better now, too.
---
It has nothing to do with your name. 
---
And everything to do with your naive crusade to fix the industry. 
---
Keep it old school...
---
I always end up regretting resorting to a guide or google
---
and its made a world of difference having the ability to super fast reload a single round. so good. 
---
That's too inconvenient and i don't have perks to spare for that, really no need to keep 500....
---
LOL
---
Hmmm. Water &amp; lead, you say.. That may be a good enough reason to relocate.  Now to find the waterfall. 
---
I don't know if offline base protection in PVE servers were from mods or from the base game itself but after having had bases raided to pieces by people able to spend much more time than I was online harvesting stupid amounts of resources I really enjoyed the PVE.
---
I like the Fallout style of your base despawning though. 
---
Quad double barrel is kinda awesome tho. And only reloads 2 for 8.
---
I was banned from WoW a couple of times.
---
Trust me though, I deserved it.
---
Oh yes that place. Im lvl 186 but i guess that does not matter
---
Got a scatter gammer wave rifle last night. Pew pew pew for 1 and a half clip, weapon broke. Sad face. By the way, I haven't modded or made any every weapons, what's the difference between beta and gamma wave weapons? U looted both and both are at 75 dmg.
---
Name one other triple A game with the type of bugs this game had at launch. 
---
Pretty sure hairstyles and tattoos used to be just in the game, crazy I know. 
---
And no, I don’t blindly believe shit like Bethesda fan boys. I wouldn’t do that, it’s just not smart.
---
Pfffffft, just write off valid criticism as blah blah blah, genius stuff.
---
This is how you get god like skills in any game, especially this one. Deliberately make things 10x harder, then when you take the handicap off my goodness my Guinness!
---
Also makes it extremly satisfying.
---
Seen the new fireproof perk? 
---
Yeah I think a friend gave me some of that but Incase I run out and don’t get to that quest  right now I want to have a bunch made.
---
Indeed there is just depending on your play. Again i am giving the OP the best advice i can for what i call the Bethesda Horder Syndrome. I personally keep my junk alot higher than that because i spend alot of time building weapons , armor and meds for others to help them out.
---
Nope, is that new with the update? Care to explain?
---
Naive crusade, jeeeesuuuuuuuus. I had no idea people were contempt with this kind of garbage. I am so glad this games were so low, it just restores my faith in the gaming community that at least most are not as brain dead as Bethesda apologists.
---
Dont do whitespring, play like normal people do. Easy solve.
---
But but but THEY ARE DOING NOTHING
---
Hate to break it to you, but even having it installed on your PC, without it being active, even on another drive will get you banned, so just owning the software would have resulting in the OP being banned..
---
Bethesda and a couple mod author friends currently banned because Cheat Engine is useful in modding and more than a couple authors have it installed..
---
Can you give me an example of a scenario where you would need 500 junk in your inventory ?
---
Naive crusade, jeeeesuuuuuuuus. I had no idea people were contempt with this kind of garbage. I am so glad this games numbers were so low, it just restores a little bit of faith in the gaming community that at least most are not as brain dead as Bethesda apologists.
---
Using the perk allowd you to withstand almost all blowback damage from TSE weapons.
---
Bro youre doing it wrong, Im telling you.
---
I don't get why you would want this...? It's so easy to avoid PVP if you don't want to get involved in it. I turned pacifist on and I've had 0 problems since. People can slap me around but I regenerate and reallllly if they want to get it on I have a full inventory of problems for 'em.
---
Didn't they do that on Titanfall?
---
Why is no one making a big deal out of the lever action fix??? That alone was huge!!
---
Also, ya know, no more duping and other fuckery. Thats cool too. 
---
I've told friends to wait a couple months to buy the game...and so far I'm standing by that.
---
That and/or neon signage.
---
I'm already liking this ~~cult~~ service we're building here.... 
---
Here's an example of another company that was rushed to put out the game, but this time was not content that it was nowhere near finished! Not to the level of No Man's Sky though lmao
---
&gt; You already made the mistake of buying it, at least that’s what it sounds like to me. Why waste more time on it? 
---
I don't buy a lot of games, I make an effort to try something in its entirety before judging it.  Not everything is as bad as it seems at face value, in 76's case it is much worse.  I'm not in the minority, I honestly don't think anyone genuinely likes this game but they have hard coded buyer's remorse that wants to shield their mind's from thinking they made a bad decision buying it.  I accepted it was a bad decision a long time ago to buy it, but I have insomnia so it gives me something to do late at night.  Haven't played in about 3 weeks still
---
See my old post I think it gave it way more flavor

---
Didn't i just do that?. Outside of the need to have a heavy supply. Some might be bulking for their daily vendor runs, some might be like the users over at settlement sub that like to rebuild and see what they can do. Or if your like myself you keep a healthy supply just to help others.
---
OP,
---
It is possible to get them on the phone and resolve this, or by email, it sucks, and a knee jerk over reaction, but they are getting hit on both ends, and it's not shocking. 
---
You'll likely have to invest some time however... So you'll have to decide what it's worth..
---
Well they could dupe bobbleheads and kill you insanely fast with slap damage, even if you don't hit back or have pacifist mode active. Or just kill SBQ before you're fast-travelled to the event. So it affects both, PvP and PvE.

what is the content of the game? farming legendaries based on rng what is gambling. can u store them in the 600kg limited stash? no. can u sell them to vendors? no becuase 200cp limit/fraction. can u sell thewm others? no becuase mosty of the drop is junk and no auction house to sell them. can u use them as resource? no. just no. this is just a badly designed game by peoples who never played online game.
---
 i really don't care with ur downvote its just mark of ur stupidity. and thats why does not matter.
---
It's a great suggestion. I don't think anyone has said that before. 
---
I know people waiting to hear back after more than 2 weeks.. Not just that simple.
---
Hmmm i don't really see it, but to each his own i guess.Cool.
---
Ikr?! I loled so hard at the op
---
verry nice list, thanks !
---
&gt;wait until they get to 50% before repairing
---
Excellent point, especially for lower level players I reckon.
---
I used to repair almost every time I got to a bench, but it killed my resources, so now I wait as long as I can mentally handle haha
---
I asked the same question when I seen it lol. 
---
Scorchedbeast fissures, if you dare.
---
Indeed met people who almost never touch their 600 stash weight. Then you have true horders that will even take the slow walk over throwing stuff out.
---
You just don't understand the art, man.
---
Phoenix vendor in Watoga. Around 10.000 caps without perks or charisma.
---
I've only killed 2 players so far. One broke into my munitions factory and I rewarded him with a vats headshot crit with my gauss rifle. The other was during Monster Mash.
---
Ouch 10k, thanks
---
There are plenty of legitimate traders with absolute hordes of inventory, far exceeding normal player levels.  Trading reddits, dicords and the like have people selling bulk items for caps and there are undoubtedly many who have probably traded for extremely large volumes from dupers, either with or without knowing they were duped.  You can't just punish everyone blindly for having inflated inventory levels.
---
Hell yes...
---
Raider Power Armor for the win...
---
Daggers and fun weapons only...
---
No TSE's and never max out the perk load out..
---
Then people wonder how you just killed 15 glowing ghouls, with a dagger, in as many seconds as it took them to run to the door..
---
Yeah, I read about that too. 
---
How does that situation prove that they can't burn all of the dupes?  
---
Accidental data loss of a paying customer is unacceptable in ANY industry and a show of poor control within the systems they have running. Did it actually happen? was the customer compensated? Is there any record of this? Stop. You don't know and neither do I..

Haha no cult business here. We don't worship or believe any deity  as a group. We simply provide a service. It's pure capitalism, my friend : the trye way to bring down the commies!
---
[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ad6bxr/bethesda_please_fix_this_gamebreaking_damage) how they do it. I tested it with a friend. My dragon was a 1shot slap dmg kill. Handmade 2-3 shots.
---
Iirc the armour mod is "dense" or something.
---
I've just accepted I don't need those plans I haven't found yet. Sure others may not feel that way.
---
Not saying you shouldn't be able to play as a trader if you want to, and I get that was part of Bethesda's design plan, player controlled people filling in for NPCs but I've never had a retail job IRL there is zero chance I'll have one in fantasy make believe life.
---
Will PC traders give me a better price because of my Perk cards? 
---
Thanks Maple slipped my mind.
---
&gt;  I'm not bold enough to try without any Starched Genes, which he/she warned would remove everything at once.
---
Bit late on the reply here, but no. With 0 starched genes enabled, you will not lose ALL mutations in the shower. They will still go one at a time, but you will keep losing mutations if you stay in the shower. I just jump in and jump back out, rinse/repeat until a mutation disappears. 
---
I have

Speed Demon
---
Twisted Muscles 
---
Marsupial
---
I'm a Melee build. I love being Faster, Stronger, and being able to Jump higher. 
---
If you choose the right mutations, and equip the right  perks, you can be way OP. 
---
Lol sometimes you can feel like a freaking GOD! lol xD
---
I got mine in a trade. But I believe they are 12k with no perks
---
yes!
---
your life must be so fulfilled to come and spew your toxins here.
---
sad really
---
Ya, we met your kind yesterday when I had a friend buy the game and his first impression was a group of griefers calling us cheaters because of our level difference. Great work.
---
you could just block them and server hop once
---
It's something to do with doors. Currently you can intentionally dupe your camp budget however many times you want by building a door, opening said door, then placing another door, then opening that one, etc. Goes up by 1 dupe count per door.
---
My theory is that when you have maybe 2 doors in an area they can "assign" themselves as the anchor for that room or something. Doors are VERY easily switched to have front or back orientation. Unless you're paying attention there's a good chance you put your door on backwards, wanted it to go the other way, etc. Probably causes overlap, thus that room gets duped.
---
Played with it once to make a field of vault boy statues outside the whitespring golf club. 2k vault boys were.... interesting.
---
I see exactly what you are saying, but I don't actually use a lot of vats. I've had a few glitches where i get stuck in it and can't attack, that's why i ended up going with dodgy in the first place because my action bar was literally doing nothing for me. Hopefully this next patch will fix it. what would you suggest i trade that perk out for?
---
I also suggest investing in a good 3* GamaGun..
---
I'll let you figure out why
---
" I've almost died a few times with the mode enabled when some of the higher level players get bored waiting for the next wave of ghouls  "
---
lure them to golf club, where the lots of car parking. and burn him alive. 
---
Love this spot! I just relocated my camp there yesterday for the deposit.
---
No. If hundreds of support requests cripple a three billion dollar company, they've got much bigger problems than Fallout 76.
---
No, no safe zone.
---
I've been running around there in a Nuke Zone, but it turned into hoards of players chasing the few spawned monsters...
---
Why I was happy to get a 3 star marine chest with 20% weapon weight reduction. Too bad it has worse armor/energy stats than my scout armor chest...need to get deep pocket for it. My scout armor has deep pocket so ends up only saving me a net 2 lbs lol.
---
My lord yes yes yes yes yes!.
---
Hell i would roll and level two lads for this style.
---
PvP server style when i am in the mood and my PVE lad when i want to chillax 
---
It's slightly southwest of the Carson Family Bunker in the Mire.  I had to finagle my camp a bit to get both the lead and water in and couldn't go too far west due to the crashed plane. The lrad deposit is just on the edge of my camp and I could only for two large purifiers in the water. 
---
Acting tough with non native speakers, typing from a phone. I suppose you, on the other hand, must be quite the educated one, ah?
---
I don't like this trend of charging full price for what a publisher knows is basically an Early Access beta-level release.
---
But I'm sure this isn't what the devs who do the actual work would prefer, either. Y'all tackled a \*whole\* lot of issues in this first major correction; far more than I was expecting. And to be able to move it up early, which helps both players (a strong positive after the bad reaction to the non-announcement) and Beth (as more time to get real-world testing in before dealing with the draconian console patch management process).
---
Well done! This is a hugely noticeable improvement in the game experience.
---
just a hobby programmer, but wouldn't it be possible to have the renaming functions of items client-side? there'd be no reason for any items to have consistent names (i.e. when dropped the name does not need to be retained for when another player picks it up). it's, after all, just to allow you to sort and manage your inventory/stash: so the name value might as well be stored locally.
---
You can still like fallout and hate this game. That's all I have to say to you.
---
What build are you using? Empath also makes you take, what was it 33% more damage or something? If your using a melee build than owning all the mutations will heavily effect your strength therefore making your melee weapons do less damage and reducing your carry weight by 5 each point. I prefer the mutations that give you extra mobility, like marsupial, speed demon, bird bones etc.
---
Yup. TSE is not an end game weapon. It is a "I couldn't be bothered with these mobs 30 levels below me" weapon.
---
And you know EVERYONE needs to fight the queen to finish the story mode so if it was meant to be an anti queen weapon then it is right EVERYONE has one. 
---
No that’d be the opposite. If my life was so fulfilled that I only had this to bitch about, then that would be something to be happy about.
---
You were sooo close to a good insult. Go on, give it another shot.
---
It's not just support requests, it's people quitting and leaving bad review, because a casual playing suddenly losing his only good weapon or whatever might make them just leave..
---
Same here. Never used to crash but now it happens frequently in nuke zones :(
---
Hell yea

Expert would be a 2 star card that affects weapons just like basic scraper 
---
Master scrapper is a separate card that is 4 star and lets you scrap in the field without a work bench. 
---
Yes you could equip all 7 card 
---
* Scrapper for more basic materials (from weapons only)
---
* Expert for more rare materials  (from weapons only)
---
* Master for field scraping with out a work bench
---
or you could just put on the Master scrapper and 
---
* pick 2 loose screws and not a .5 lbs toy car.  
---
* pick up 5 steal not a nitrogen cylinder at 2lbs
---
What platform? Mild specifics on what you lost? Have an alt sitting on some "Christmas giveaway" weapons (read:mass duped) I got from strangers a while back. Might have something that feels like your ol' reliable.
---
I just take all my clothes off and say take my bounty through the mic ^^
---
Hahahahaha. You think this is about Bethesda?
---
You're a naive pansy. It's about American consumerism. You think one game with not great sales numbers is going to accomplish jack shit?  No.
---
You think you're "we can demand better" sentiment will accomplish anything? 
---
No. 
---
It doesn't work that way. 
---
If it did, planned obsolescence wouldn't still be a thing child. 
---
Making the circuit around Watoga has to be the most lucrative in terms of time spent vs reward, especially since players pop in and out of there so often for vending and farming and constantly respawn robots.  I always do a daily loop and pick up at least 1 legendary of some quality.  If you finish Mayor For A Day, it does feel completely unfair and I find myself sparing the non-legendary bots to just go about their duty.  It's like slaughtering cattle.  I just want to grab a couple choice steaks and leave the rest in peace.  Other players are happy to mow them down.
---
Today I was exploring the far southern area around Vault 96 and Spruce Knob and there were a lot of legendaries, at least one per location and several 3 stars.  I got a lvl 45 3 star pitchfork with instigating, 50% limb damage and +1 Str.  I really wished it was a sledge or super sledge so I could sell it to someone.  I just left it in the blue suitcase at Watoga Station.
---
While vendoring at Harper's Ferry, I got three legendary super mutants, one a 3 star that dropped some random two star raider arm.  I don't know why 3 star legendaries don't always drop 3 star items.  The legendary loot tables seem kinda dumb, given how rare a 3 star enemy is.
---
yeah greg over at bethesda, who runs fallout 76 all alone, should stop focusing on the atom shop and go to bug fixes. tsk. greg really needs to pull his shit together.
---
Which one are you? 
---
Muuuch better, though I will say it’s lacking originality. You’re about 6 comments late on the troll/basement stuff.  
---
Queeeen. Scorbeast fucking flying queen.
---
have fun with that most of the pvp servers would just end up under populated 
---
They have reportedly said there is no unique item code and they don't monitor them anyway. 
---
lol I'd give you a discount. Just cause I'm sure nobody would remember to equip it ha
---
Depends how it's handled. Do I get to role-play as a cashier or do I get to be the merch buyer, going out and trying to find good loot to stock or unique goods that could be sold on my behalf.

---
Good point!
---
argh! again, going "these are long patch notes", noooo
---
sorry i just can't believe there are so many that feel these patch notes are long. every damn time, too.
---
but yeah great on bethesda to include so many things that people have raised concerns about. that's not something you see in many other games, even if they have long patch notes.
---
Something you clearly cannot grasp.
---
It's a video game, not real life. I get it, we put many hours into it but I wouldn't mind of everything were deleted so all people had to start over from scratch. It's not good feeling forced or tied to something that bad, I know. It's like those WoW players, if blizzard where to restart every server I'm sure people would kill themselves. How can some folks be so extremely afraid of changes?
---
I don't think casual players are on the FO76 item trading subreddit.
---
Is this to do with blocking people? I think if someone blocks you, they don't show on your map. Annoying if someone is trolling.
---
That's what I was thinking too and by locking character to the Server type it would prevent cross contamination like in WOW
---
Just added you my dude
---
I dropped some stuff at the White Springs Train Station tonight (PS4).  I try to drop stuff that I don't need at train stations, usually in the suitcases, etc, as both they and the Overseerer's Stash are frequented quite often.  But this time I was in a hurry and just dropped a bag.  Of course, lots of people do this so it could be anyone... (grin)
---
S W O L E
---
Nope it’s not just one game, and Jesus Christ you might have the most pathetic outlook on the industry I have ever heard.
---
And it just might work, if we would just trim the hedges of the people that want to so desperately believe that they made the right purchase, even when it’s staring them in the face that the thing they bought is garbage and the person/developer that made it thinks of you as nothing but mindless fodder that will eat up whatever they put on your plate.

---
With a world population of 20 per server I think it would work out fine and even possible result in the smaller PVP community having Well known people or gangs. 
---
Thanks! 
---
also, getting the trapper plans are so easy, meaning before this patch, you could re-craft whatever level of trappers armor you wanted for dirt cheap (like 8 rubber, 6 leather, and something something). compare to repairing it for nearly double the amount of mats, with ballistic fiber required...
---
yeah, crafting all day long made a lot of sense.
---
"It's a studio known for releasing broken games, so them charging 60$ for an incredibly broken multiplayer only game with the lowest amount of content out of any game they released in the recent decade, and cosmetic 'micro'transactions worth the price of an entire story DLC. We should've expected that, don't know why people are surprised." 
---
Maybe cause being THAT incompetent and greedy, is fucking amazing. And the fact it's Bethesda excuses literally nothing.
---
For max damage?     
---
     
---
You'll probably want the mag with the best armour penetration on (ie superior) and the automatic receiver with the highest base per shot damage.     
---
    
---
Everything else can be kept as standard to keep weight down - the lower the gun weight the less AP it costs to use in VATs.    
---
Add a scope if you find the accuracy value on the gun is too low to make VATS hits consistently.     
---
Same
---
Thank you, I figured out this whole time I had lever action confused with bolt. Lol
---
"Fixed an issue where bashing an enemy with the Railway Rifle or Crossbow would add the projectile to the enemy's inventory." lol classic
---
I would definitely want to be able to switch and choose between PvP and PvE servers.
---
But if they fixed PvP damage (like setting a max damage per a shot so everyone is not just 1 shotting.) Then I would totally eat this up.
---
Some really great ideas to there.
---
11 Luck on my shotgunner.
---
You'll remember the Grand Canyon far longer than your thirst for a faded black power armor paint.
---
Hope you had a nice trip! Can't wait to get out there again myself.
---
Yep, my bathroom is at the bottom of that waterfall :) I moved there when they fixed it so you couldn't lose your camp. I put mine on the edge of the rocks and built out and down so it's more of a treehouse with a water purifier in the stream at the bottom. I'll have to get some pics to my pc (I play on PS4) so I can show it off, this is the second post I've seen today of this same spot.
---
Thanks for posting this info by the way, its helping me come up with an unarmed build. Curious though on why no perception bonus listed? Does that get nullified from something?
---
[PC] since the newest patch (10th Jan) the game crashes on the please stand by screen when launched. This happens everytime, and can no longer play.
---
i think it's not possible to compare a singleplayer game with a multiplayer game. singleplayer games are nearly always "dumped pretty quick." look at any of biowares releases: it's not like they kept receiving regular updates for very long.
---
so, mass effect andromeda is a really poor example here. there are some examples that are better: mostly, on top of my mind, it's gaming companies beneath NCsoft suffering to this (their latest victim being the fps Ghost in the Shell that went f2p on steam and then abruptly was shut down).
---
i think we'd have to look at other games under zenimax that are online to really get some idea. does elder scrolls online still receive updates? etc.
---
Shoot the wings off scorchbeasts and scrap them. 
---
Yeah that seems like just so much work. Like the game would just become your life
---
Same! First time in The Mire I was scared shitless moving tree to tree. Now it's a peaceful night stroll in the swamp.

On a side note you have already declared yourself Brotherhood,  So as an enemy of the rightful government of  USA and representative of the Enclave I would have to kill you Sir.
---
wow, should have asked for a refund and purchased 2 months later, its worth $11.47.  
---
You don't get it because you don't care how many people it would piss off
---
I blame it on consoles and their weak hardware for limitations like this.
---
I think I added this to the suggestion megathread a while ago, but I don't know what Beth thinks of it (or if any of them even ever saw it). Probably wouldn't hurt if you posted the idea again, I think there's a new current thread up, and the Bethesda reddit community folks are probably going to be pretty active here for a bit seeing how the patch went (so good chance it gets seen).
---
I'm not going to post it again myself, I pepper them enough as it is and Beth seeing more people requesting the same thing helps more.
---
Grenades are a bit heavier than straight jackets, I think. Makes the jackets more worthwhile.
---
yep. there's been an inproportionate amount of hate leveled at fallout 76. there are a lot of valid concerns, but there are also a lot of people piggy-backing on the hate-train to spout of regurgitated repeated lines that quite frankly make no sense (i.e. the ever-so-famous "but there are no NPCs!").
---
He’s just lying lol
---
Ghoul god!:)

They can track the mules pretty easily though... Low level characters with huge inventories.

Go to the Whitespring vendors and find the robot selling recipes.

Wow I did not know weight effected ap so that's why heavy weapons don't do would will with vats 
---
This bug **was NOT fixed** by January 10 patch.
---
I'm grateful for the fixes. Still have quite a bit to go with weapon balance, laser weapon issues, power armor chassis identification and the like,  but they are making progress! 
---
English isn't my first language, and I'm pretty sure grammar knowledge is not related to computational brain power. It's just a measure of the time you've spent writing and speaking it.
---
I appreciate your agreement but you could have resorted to something less obvious than a grammar joke.
---
&gt; The scatter attachment should have it's damage/accuracy increased when the appropriate shotgun perks are equipped.
---
It should not cause the weapon to degrade five times as fast either.
---
Add me: r_castro33

Just picked up a ton of loot on whitesprings today. Be willing to dump some off for freeeee
---
My experience with Harper's Ferry is that if there is one 3 start, there usually are more 1/2/3\*. But most often there are none.
---
We're well past all this type of stuff. https://imgur.com/a/AJWHCml

Yes, I've noticed shorter loading times, but they couldn't eliminate infinite loading zones completely - it's less frequent now, but still experienced 2 yesterday.

It's a fair reward for the munitions/Caps he spent... Whatever the items he uses he is limited by his weight.

The robco research center has an event where you have to kill a bunch of army robots too, I got two legendaries there yesterday, but be careful, goddamn corporals guns are naaaaaaasty

Server shutdown?! Did you see this? I'm all for grouping up btw.

No see, that's where you're not getting it.

It's the way it is. I may not like it, but it's the way it is, and the way it will continue to be. 
---
I'm not American. I'm Canadian. We don't have have this nearly as an unhealthy relationship with our big companies. Even Canadian institutions like Tim Hortons  are wary of pissing off Canadians. 
---
However, the US is the major game market, and the US consumer as a whole has no such power. The cult of the new dominates. For every one of you, there's 3000 who just want the new thing. 
---
Games. Phones. Cars. Appliances. Other entertainment. 
---
You see, for me? I don't need to justify purchases. Money doesn't dominate my life. I'll make more tomorrow. 
---
This idea that everyone who doesn't agree with you is justifying their bad purchase is bunk, and only applies to shallow fucks who think money and possessions matter.
---
Check your perks and what weapons you have. I used a modded hunting rifle with the only damage boosts being perks and adrenaline mutation and would one shot most if headshot. Mutants always take 2
---
Still have graham?
---
I used bows and arrows in Skyrim. If my stealth sniper needed his melee I'd messed up.

Um what?

I had three spawn on me at once at the uranium mine today, that seemed kind of... odd.

I've noticed a bug with vendors since the patch - when you go to select the number of items to sell, for example if I wanted to sell 2 of my 51 Purified Water, if I don't slowly tap my way down to 2 the scroller just goes in circles - it'll run right down to 0 and then pop back up to 51. Continuous cycle, same if I hold the mouse down on the decrease arrow. Hopefully that makes sense, I don't have FRAPS or anything to make GIF of the issue.
---
Do you still have him like can I join you to trade wit him
---
Bwhahahaha shhhhh dont tell everyone xD
---
Look like plasma grenades are back on the menu
---
1. They would have to get rid of the safe zone for nukes too. 
---
2. I don't think a character should be locked into pvp, but there should be a lengthy cooldown on switching back and forth. Maybe 24 hours.
---
;) we are already friends in game good sir we shall not be harming one another.
---
Oh no this was a few hours ago when this happened
---
Still down to play after whatever is happening now?
---
I’ve seen the show. Good for you finding a home. I’ve had mine a long time 
---
Yes, I do get a touch nervous when I'm at 75% condition, but my weapons only seem to take a beating during a nuke run.  I remember first starting out and being at Morgantown airport with a broken 10mm, a broken hunting rifle and scrounging melee weapons to try and finish the event there.  I overcompensated for a while with rank 5 gunsmith and rank 3 white knight (scorchbeasts used to tear my armor up), but my gear seems to be much more durable now.  Maybe I'm just dealing better damage, my gear is better, the mutations help, or a combination of everything.  Either way, I'm happy not to be wasting so much time and resources on constantly fixing things.
---
I have had the very same thing happen on two different characters, I'm not exactly sure what's triggering it though.
---
YAY!
---
For pvp they should get rid of the explosive weapons tbh. I love mine but if you want to make it fun, people 1 or 2 shotting each other would be boring.
---
Without the lock it kinda kills snipers because of the slap damage system in place. I understand that getting one shot would suck so they would have to figure that out and maybe even give helmets some DR. 
---
There are so many QoL changes we really *need* that probably won't happen for another few months
---
There's a thread on here that has a huge list and there isn't much on it I think shouldn't be in the game, if anything honestly.
---
Ever since the invisible grenade weight bug I never pick up frag grenades. My weight always seems too much than it actually should be
---
what console?
---
What kind of world is it where pipe weapons are better than energy weapons?
---
*You leave the vault and start looking for a weapon. Dozens of laser rifles are lying around everywhere, but you leave that trash alone. Fast forward 50+ levels, you're a wasteland warrior and your only worry is that the Brotherhood of Steel is going to come and confiscate your pipe weapons. They have no interest in lasers.*
---
You say that, what about new players? Or those who play only to relax, low levels who don't have such weapons or possibilities?
---
The one that's built inside the train and continuing out one end, seemingly mostly out of scrap metal, with the skeletons in lab coats? Outside of Abandoned Bog Town? There are other trains and other suspended rails and loops elsewhere on the map, but this contraption doesn't show up anywhere else.
---
Isn't it one of the guns that are locked in a level range? there was a great post on here a few days ago saying what guns spawn at vendors at what level.
---
Oh and by the way? 
---
You're doing the same thing. You go bashing the game and those who defend it to try to feel smart. To try to feel like you made a bad purchase but you're too smart and can recognize it. 
---
So you need to spout it off to other people to prove to yourself that you didn't get taken. You're aware. 
---
I found having a stash of mini nukes and missiles to be a massive waste of stash space. I think mini nukes take up something like 6 each? The materials for them are considerably lighter, therefore makes sense to just craft some if you need them.
---
How many fusion cores are you stockpiling, or plasma cores if you're using a plasma weapon - both of those consume a fair bit of weight. 
---
If only there were people who Bethesda could pay to play the game and provide feedback. Maybe some sort of assurance of quality person.
---
But of course, it's easier to have people pay to do your QA work for you.
---
I always found it hilarious the Danse was using a laser rifle. I mean really. He could have face punched his enemy for more damage. I had a 2 shot battle rifle and eventually a handmade that did Way more damage and what was I? Some half dead frozen housewife that was packing better armour and weapons than a Paladin. Hmmmm.... 
---
I'm confused why that means they should be locked.  If you make a character for pvp that is a sniper, it doesn't mean you have to use it for pve too.
---
That was one of the most annoying things!
---
What in sam hell is this lol...
---
As a high level (L188) character that uses primarily heavy (Gatling/50-cal) and commando (CR and handmade), and has access to prime receivers, one of my functional high-output backups is the plasma gun. 
---
I have a bloodied version (and am almost always &lt;=20% health) **on a flamer conversion**. In F4 this was the single highest damage indefinite one-lick-of-the-flame-kill crowd control weapon, like an explosive minigun only proximity safe. The plasma flamer had three times the regular flamer damage, and three times the range. In F76 it takes more effort to make it one-hit-kill. A prime receiver adds raw damage but takes away the burning damage of the alternate beta/gamma receiver (remembering burning from successive hits doesn’t stack, but added damage from prime receiver hits does). My gun’s damage displayed adds up to about 130 per hit. It wouldn’t break through the SBQ but it’s great for crowds. 
---
It has two problems that make it a very seldom weapon: 
---
1. It’s bugged to use rifleman when it should use commando (or heavy). 
---
2. It doesn’t burn through CND as bad as an automatic laser with a beam splitter does, it’ll get through 300 rounds odd before breaking, but still. A Gatling or 50 Cal get through around 2,000. 
---
Also (but this is choice, not game fault) my mutation stack includes grounded for the 100ER, which presumably reduces the half of the plasma damage that isn’t ballistic. 
---
I don't think people are forgetting about it. 
---
People are just learning to manage their inventory in this light survival game. 
---
Survival games. Inventory management is a thing.
---
I really have been wanting to get a TSE Gatling so i can swap between the 2 like that. Right now i have a 3\* explosive gatling that is decent but not that great without the 2 shot in taking down SB/SBQ. 
---
Since they added the other legendary rifles today I'm thinking of holding off on buying a TSE gatling for now. I know it'd still be better overall but I've been heavy since around lvl60-70 and I'm starting to get bored but I'm not wanting to start a new character just yet. If I do end up going some form of a rifle build I do also have a TSE Gauss which is stupidly OP for everything that isnt the SBQ especially if i can find another that is instigating. 
---
I may also invest in fireproof and that chest mod now as well. I'm getting tired of people walking in front of me and making me kill myself.
---
Databases are databases. Nosql, sql, they all have design patterns. 
---
That's like saying you have to be the engineer who designed a car engine to be able to give input on how to improve performance. Same Laws of physics apply to all databases, just like do all car engines.
---
I don't know much about coding but the devs could just make every single item in the game have seperate ID codes or just random numbers attached to them hidden in the game code and the only way to get the same item with the same ID code/number whatever is to dupe... Apologies if someone has already mentioned this.
---
russians....
---
I thought there were two doorway panels in that set, one for metal doors and one for wood doors.
---
My lord this should not be possible at all... its like the test hall from Skyrim.
---
What we’re doing is not QA. As I mentioned in the write up, QA people sit all day with bug tracking software and reproduce the same bug again and again. You’d find their work tedious. They don’t enjoy the game as you and I do. 
---
Yes, there are bugs. 
---
Guess what. Bethesda didn’t turn on their bug tracking software the day they released the title. It’s been on for a while and a lot of the issues have been in in since before launch, though perhaps not prioritized as it is now based on how bad it stings users. 
---
They could either ship now and fix what matters most in aggressive iteration, or give you a polished game in 2020. 
---
I’m happy with their choice. 
---
Adrenaline easily. Even though it takes 5 points at max, +60% damage is nothing to scoff at, especially when it is easier to trigger while playing solo. I would even go as far as to only have rank 1 of action boy to get all 5 ranks of Adrenaline. If you dont want Adrenaline the next best imo would be Moving Target b/c you will likely be sprinting to close the gap since you dont use VATS.
---
Once a character is made on a PvP server it can’t play on a Pve server. Because it would be to easy to gather resources and materials on PVE and jump on to the PVP with a un fair advantage. It’s a paid service for most MMO to limit this effect.
---
The thought you put into this is astounding. 
---
Thanks for the replies, guys, I’ll check those areas out. 😊
---
Yeah I understand that. I just want to hear the community’s thoughts and stuff. Not the annoying “give me my refund”. I think I have had a decent go at the game and tbh the good out weighs the bad
---
I've had a camp at a farm up North with several hives on a shed inside my camp. 
---
They spawned no problem.
---
yes, and its in ONLINE GAME
---
"we should be thanking them for doing a job they should have done before release! WELL DONE BETHESDA, THANKS FOR NOT GIVING A SHIT UNTIL YOU HAD TO!"
---
What is duping?
---
I wasn't at a high enough level to try taming it, but I just stumbled across a random crab at the spawn point between Abbie's bunker and Thunder Mountain.
---
Could allways be worse!
---
It’s called Dabney Homestead, to the south east of Harper’s Ferry.
---
I think Glassed Cavern is the best source aside from jumping around the map to farm all the fissure sites.
---
Using Excavator arms on power armor will give you better yields, and swapping in Super Duper perk when refining the ore at a chem bench helps, too.  Super Duper also works with flux creation.
---
Duping means duplicating in game items by exploiting a glitch. 
---
This definitely needs to be looked at reaaaallly fast lol.
---
I mean, they can still trade with people ingame.. 
---
One of my buddies also had a weird glitch were 3 spawned inside of eachother so everything was 3x the damage but as he killed them their bodies dropped outside the main SB. 
---
Ye lol I'm such an idiot for not knowing about a perk that isn't even released on my current gaming platform. Oh woe is me
---
So what and how was he duplicating items? I've never experienced this glitch by accident and I'm genuinely curious
---
Thank you thought imma looking forward to this update now for this perk. Gonna have to rework my build
---
Yeah thats pretty much what i suggested, only it would also take a bit of time to craft them so its not super op
---
It’s not possible to do it on accident. It’s intentional which is what makes it exploitative. 
---
No problem it makes them pretty insane.
---
Yeah. See I largely support this idea
---
Except when you see guys greifing low lvl players 50+ levels below them. 
---
This is a big problem I’ve definitely noticed with the Gatling plans and laser, it feels like it’s only 10 minutes before either break then I have to go back to my normal Gatling gun for quite awhile which I don’t have nearly as much ammo for because the other two break so much
---
No I thought people would agree because I saw some horseshit on the front page thanking Bethesda for doing the bare bones. Clearly I’m in the minority, but that’s just fine, because this is also a minority. Enjoy your game
---
Ok I see your point there.
---
That is no solution, just a workaround.. also when you have claimed workshops and just can't leave because of that... Better solution would be, that you can only build camp close to players who you have on your friend list or actually in party. Also possible would be to change some workshops so they can be claimed by say 8 players at once where everybody have separate build budget and can build his own building...
---
Well that’s right but duper’s did damage the economy most sensible players continued on properly and other didn’t and exploited the game your forgetting trading which is a part of the game too bethesda shouldn’t  put in trading too would be just another thing the community would whinge about unfortunately true hardcore fallout fans would continue to play and survive and grind while the random duper’s and idiots who took advantage of the glitch are the same people puting  it on YouTube and then giving the game
---
 Negative reviews who complain about no end game content ect upping the level caps once all the douch bags who are happy to ruin the game I love
---
And enjoy are gone will make the game fun again can’t wait 
---
The proper pronoun is whatever contrived and socially irrelevant and nonsensical pronoun the robot wishes to force on you, sillies. You know, because that robot can be non-binary if it wants. (Good luck with that, right? xD Sooo many levels this little blurb works on. xD)
---
Okay, i’m on xbox and wasn’t having any bugs with mine except when trying to attach it straight to another fence. what i found to work is to put it up against the edge of a wall and then build off of that. not sure if PC will be different 
---
Still playing??
---
No, I’m not that fucking stupid. But I think “block the player” is a trash solve. Even if it was “we take this very seriously and we will look into it further, blah blah”, at least it pretends like they’re actually going to look into it.
---
I understand for privacy and legal reasons that they can’t disclose what actions they take on someone’s account.
---
Spikes and heads. Heads on spikes. Heads on walls. Piles of heads.
---
I hope you never reproduce.
---
afaik Beth already know about it for a long time, they cant delete this room, they just banning ppl who enter, but it didnt stop them
---
Oh. Well I guess he deserved the ban, then. If it's a glitch you have to hunt for. Poor guy. Wish he had just put a little more time into hunting or begging off people online. I hope he finds something equally cool and immersive
---
Awe your just weak and have asthma. Game know it. Lol
---
The beta was too short so that justifies cheating? What a weird way to justify behaving like an impatient child that can’t even properly play an easy game like this without exploiting lmao. 
---
I’m aware. Approaching it from a “we will look into it, thanks for the heads up”, I feel, would be a much better approach than “oh just block that player so you don’t encounter them again”. Blocking players doesn’t solve the issue of people duping.
---
I don't have item that was duplicated 
---
But they want a player driven economy to exist. They just don't want it flooded with illegitimate weapons 
---
They cannot stop the method used to enter?.
---
Its about time
---
Some interesting things I've noticed from the first one. Vault 96 jumpsuit plans, just more confirmation about the DLC. Psychotats recipe does not exist, which is a huge bummer for bloodied builds. Jet recipe exists, wonder how it will work if it is eventually implemented. Grape Mentats recipe does exist (not surprising but it is the one chem recipe I cant seem to find in the Enclave bunker)
---
As for this place existing, it makes sense for testing purposes. But there should be no way to access it after any build goes live.
---
lies
---
Low levels have a pvp buff that I hear is pretty good... If you are in your CAMP then you have the home advantage stand your ground or leave... I've got tons of hours in the game and PvP has never been a problem.
---
Any damage to a camp if fixed for free when you move it.
---
This is the wasteland people are not always gonna be nice.
---
Unreal news bloody scummy dupers. 
---
Congratulations, you played yourself
---
While I agree with you, I am actually having alot of success with a plasma rifle flamer. It does seem to use all the cards I thought it would, melts just about anything I point at, and while have less than amazing durability, it's also super light weight compared to ballistic rifles, enough to easy have two or even three inplace if a single modded sniper rifle. The energy ammo reduction works with fusion cores as a bonus too. 
---
Infact, my only problem with the build so far other than still looking for legendary versions is ammo. Even with ammo crafter, super duper and sitting on a copper extractor, I still spend a silly amount more game time farming matts for ammo vs my heavy Gunner character. That wouldn't be so bad if he was stronger than my heavy Gunner, but with healing teammates being not needed at the moment, I m not sure I can say he is.
---
Why do you play it if you dislike it so much? 
---
My friend and I legit duped for our first time. I didn't know what was happening. But then he said, after I asked a few hundred times, that he wanted to try duplicating. He ended up only duplicating like 200 5.56 rounds and crashed the whole server. I was playing with him, and two other friends. They got kicked even though they were half way across the map. 
---
I usually just drop them so other players can have them, I hardly use power armor so I just keep 1 or 2 on me.
---
I mean, thanks for more detailed patch notes I guess. They’re a good read and it seems a lot of improvements were made.  
---
This is good.  
---
I think many people feel that a “thank you” is giving Bethesda a pass for fixing issues that should not have taken this long to address. Many feel that a patch won’t fix the fundamentally broken design philosophy. Forget about bugs for a moment. 
---
*”We always start with the world”*
---
They created a gorgeous world with spectacular set pieces and easter eggs and teddy bears in cute scenarios. And then they struggled to figure out what kind of fun shit the player could do in that world. 
---
The world came first and the player second, when it should be the opposite. 
---
*”What can the player do?”* was asked too late in the development cycle. 
---
Most often, the things posted on r/fo76 are a wishlist of ideas that will likely never make in the game, which is sad because this community has made a better game on paper than what we were given. So “thank you” community. 
---
Ohhh or OR give us some circular walls. I wanna make towers. :(
---
...did you get out of your PA and then try to craft/repair it at the station while your PA is still out?
---
I crashed yesterday, right after the update. 2 guys launched a nuke from Alpha on the fissure, and I crashed to desktop during the fight against the SBQ. I don't know if it's only me or the server.

speak badly of or tell lies about (someone) so as to damage their reputation.

well why im not surprised?
---
There's nothing wrong with appreciating the work of others. Even when that work fixes a problem or mistake on their part.
---
Some people will be supportive of that work. For others, like yourself, there's nothing Bethesda can do short of going back in time. You think that's the only way to send a message. No understanding. No forgiveness. Just be mad. Bad mouth the company and people who support their product. 
---
I appreciate that Bethesda continues to patch a game I've enjoyed. A game I've enjoyed with fairly few bugs and issues. 
---
These ideas are always the same
---
&gt;And failed to do a better beta
---
You cannot tell me that when looking at how the beta was setup, you honestly believe that that was just a mistake and they didn't just treat it as a marketing tool intentionally. There are well reported major bugs they carried over from Fo4 and older..
---
&gt;Actually worked hard to fix stuff, in a reasonably timely matter 
---
You seem to have incredibly low standards. They probably worked hard, yes, the 12 people bethesda left on the project. Online games have way higher upkeep than singleplayer offline sandboxes and as a company you gotta pay respect to that. So far bethesda hasn't.
---
If you have a gamebreaking bug in a competitive online game, you apply hotfixes within days, not 8 weeks.
---
&gt; especially compared to other games and their update / patch history.. 
---
Like for example? Path of Exile or Warframe that hotfix exploits within days? Is being one the biggest companies in the industry and charging 60 bucks for your game detrimental here? Do they have to swim through their money to reach their desks like scrooge mcduck?
---
&gt; If you don't love the game, or just have a hard on for trolling. 
---
Yes, that's the point of critique and the reason people complain, they don't care. /s
---
No matter how low your standards are, as someone who probably also likes the game you should be excited for improvement and anything that encourages improvement.
---
Clearly he’s board with the game.   
---
I found it upstairs at the Dolly Sods Wilderness location in the mire, west of the dam :) 
---
Sounds like scare tactics and without proof I won't believe it. Nevertheless I'm down for restarting servers completely, it's just a video game
---
It's hard to avoid clippingnissues like that in some surfaces in an open world game. There's so many surfaces, there's going to be some issues. 
---
Feel free to trade in the game if it's so bad.
---
The rooms aren't exactly easy to get into, it's not like you walk upto a door and select open. So i don't see why it needs to be announced, having it out in public means people are more likely to be curious about getting into these rooms, as opposed to those who are outright exploiting the game.
---
If these people are continuing to use alt accounts, then they're just ploughing more money into Bethesda's pockets. 
---
So are the weak comments that don’t put any effort in explaining why they are or why they are not good. Glad my post is so identical must mean I have an understanding of what players want.
---
If they haven't, they should! It's a really nice suggestion! 
---
Out of all the legendaries I've found, a chest piece that reduces detection equivalent to 1 point in the sneak skill, a chameleon leg and a high-capacity (4 shots) crossbow are the perfect anti-everything tools I've been lucky enough to find.
---
Does it work in the opposite direction too? Tihs would pretty cool when trading with friends... press right one time to set the price to 0 for an item.
---
afaik, to enter  you need cheat engine so...
---
I found both the head and outfit at the Dolly Sods Wilderness location, west of the dam in the Mire. Happy hunting! 
---
I don't want them banned, I want their inventories wiped so they have nothing and have to start from nothing.
---
I think it'll come eventually. It was just holiday season after launch, so that's going to be the focus. 
---
Now that that has passed I expect we'll see some other varieties of decor.
---
All of those people should be capable of understanding what they’re getting into when they choose to purchase a game. 
---
I think i do.
---
Armor and gear are unequipped when in power armor.
---
I looked at it, but its deleted.
---
They aren't "rare", people are just getting them faster and easier than they would.
---
reminds me of that old western show "bounty hunter" or some such name.
---
Dude had straight up like .308 rounds in his belt but would work this mare's leg carbine like a machinegun. Thing was two and a half feet long and he dumps 12 rounds out of it, loads 4 and dumps 12 more rounds lol
---
It's a game, it's okay if people like me think Todd Howard oversold them, there's so many things wrong with Fallout76 it's okay if I feel upset about it, i'm not saying I don't like the game,  you obviously like the game and care about it too, i'd much prefer talking about how much the game gets right but I rarely do that because I have so much to complain about. 
---
Don't duped items share the same ID? I really don't get why they can't just delete them. They probably don't want to piss people off, but I say just get rid of the lot of them.

I find that a single point into the batteries included perk takes care of most of my energy ammo issues.
---
2mm EC is the only energy ammo I ever carry besides 2 fusion cores anyways.
---
Yeah but it’s growing fast. There’s always a bunch of people in there trading and chatting. There’s a new clan system now too. It’s pretty sweet. I don’t know what I’d do without that and the work loaout mod. 
---
Yeah, even revisiting what you said. Maybe on PvP servers, everyone starts new and that character is only for PvP servers. So you can play either, but they are seperate characters.
---
I still think a max dmg would be good because I think eventually people find glitches for duping or stuff once again, and you'll have people stacking magazines or finding some kind of exploit. The easy fix is just to have a max dmg cap per shot on other players..... Although I then start to see a problem with maybe weapons with a higher rate of fire having an advantage.
---
You know there's a better you somewhere inside that toxic heap you call head. Search it.
---
Holy moly idk what I would do if I ran into this
---
I get you, but the fun factor [can](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aeq4b4/when_someone_brings_a_musical_band_to_play_in_the/) still be high!
---
TSE guns that have largely avoided duping like a TSE plasma, TSE crossbow, TSE railway and their bloodied explosive counterparts, leather coat, traveling leather coat, tattered field coat, responders fireman, BOS paladin PA paint. Essentially any cosmetic that’s like 1/200 and is probably sitting on someone not using Reddit or LFG
---
White Knight perk card.
---
Same. Cant even play no matter how hard I try trying to walk to a quest location, make it a little ways, disconnect, reconnect, and spawn clear back at the location I had walked away from. Im stuck in purgatory in front of Hawks Refuge.
---
Why would I care about “game economy?”    If I want to make money, I’ll go do that in the real world.   
---
Whitesprings isn’t bad if you just pass through once. Grinding it would be mind numbingly boring but passing through once a session is worth it IMO. 
---
Upvote for the langoleers reference.
---
As someone who regularly runs around at over 700 weight in game.. I know. I know. Some people run a 'leaner' inventory than me.

&gt; Vault 96 jumpsuit plans
---
I could swear I can craft this thing.
---
No one is going to stockpile that many. Takes too much flux.
---
They were exploiting and it's been corrected.  A lot of exploiting has been corrected and good riddance.
---
Molag Bal doesn’t deserve that punishment. 
---
Happened to me too. My game crashed like 4 times since BETA release and after this patch it crashed 4 times in an hour. What the hell?
---
However, the next 2 hours happened with 0 crashes. So... I guess it's ok.
---
Lol that’s not cheating. I wouldn’t even call it exploiting. I guess you could say they’re cheating themselves by power leveling instead of just enjoying the game. 
---
Agreed 100%
---
I'm not projecting that much, only what I perceived from your comment. The new patch is out and someone in the comments is only minutes after saying "but they didn't do that and this" sounds a little bit like bitchin'. 
---
And you know what? I agree with you on the subject. But this is not the place for it. If you think it should be higher on the priority list of the devs make a post about it. Make an compelling argument, not too long, just to make a point. You know the average attention span of a redditor. 
---
If I see that post I will very likely upvote, so that Beth understands the many user want them to work faster on this issue. And it gets added to the master list.
---
(My panties are fine by the way, if they really went to the 4th dimension they may get the physics Nobel prize. And according to the rising agressivenes levels in your replies I'm signing off of this thread. See ya.)
---
you sure?
---
You're the kind of guy that doesn't say "thanks" to the waiters, right?
---
Yeah, you need a power armor frame placed on the ground, to work off of, you also need plans to make armor and stuff, but that is the same as anything else.
---
I've started to play it after the december patch, because I'm really tempted to play it, just for the story and trading/playing the economy game. As I said, in an other thread. Playing is fun. But it's not fun to crash and/or disconnect repeatedly. Playing in a broken economy, where the game was praised with player interaction and trading.   
---
My experience that really hit me like a train:
---
While I was walking at summerville dam, I encountered a guy, which tried to sell me duped items. thousand of all type of ammos, serums, stimpacks, weapons, two shot/explosives, top notch.. he also said, when I don't have any caps, I can pay with paypal. I was like wtf? I shot the guy into his face and I dealt 0 damage to him.
---
The frequent DCs I received are also a turn off for me... I did the creepy quest at... don't know the name, near the little shack and while I Did the quest I got two times a DC in 10 minutes.  
---
Playing is fun, but there are major breaks in this game, that stop fun. I hope that they learn a lesson from that, because when the next DLC comes for Fallout 76...
---
somethings still off about it's accuracy to me.
---
In third person it feels like it sends the round to the target after the recoil hits, so it's basically drawing a line from the tip of the muzzle to the target.
---
Always feel like i'm aiming right at that charging ghoul just for the shot to go behind him. Like there's a convergence distance between my eye, the rifle and the target.
---
Please!
---
I understand the survival aspect but I can barely keep 10 weapons in my stash. I am not able to tell myself "oh I'll keep this one for later".
---
I have a pic of the email. How do I post it?
---
I'm currently camped on a lead node by Cliffwatch just north of Whitesprings.  It's on the edge of a cliff, which is nice for jumping off, but no running water.  So I may need to go scout out your spot when I get home from work this morning.  
---
That's actually good, it means for those 5 levels, it doesn't require Ballistic Fiber anymore.  Ballistic Fiber has always been a requirement they just moved it back by 5 levels.
---
Added you my PSN is Grendalzzz
---
Creating a new tier of weapons isn't enough though, if the lvl 50 weapons still one-shot 90+% of everything in the game. 
---
I have one, and it doesn't fit my build. I've been waiting to sell it, but my stash is full (again), and I could use the room. What would you be willing to pay?
---
expect PS4 servers to tank a bit. Since they announced that PS4 will be a week from PC, people will be duping non-stop to get the most out of the current method before the update drops
---
They’d be able to trade with friends, or are you suggesting they can’t be with friends?
---
Just ban them.
---
Are Blueprints still unreliable?
---
Ive found leaving the area till the mission fails then rejoined the area saves your waves killed progress but it respawns the stuck npcs.
---
i've been killed by dudes that didn't even render in the slightest while farming over at the glassed mine.
---
I've got 2.5k caps 
---
Working together sounds like communism!
---
I have atoms I'm holding on to for when they start kicking raider gear/decor our way. 
---
why was this never a mod for PA helmets lol.
---
Mods are not officially supported. Use are your own risk.  People have been banned for using them.
---
There’s breaking the game, and there’s exploiting repeatedly. Different things entirely.
---
Troll calling it.
---
Sorry for the god awful formatting. Apparently I dont know how to use reddit. 
---
Yeah yeah no, people have been confirmed banned for Cheat Engine but not UI mods. As yet.
---
USMC friend of mine on PSN suggested they introduce a rifle weight perk and call it "Light infantry", the most powerful of all oxymorons.
---
Haha, my raider character too.
---
Upload it to IMGUR and then post a link. Edit your main post if you can.
---
buying the game again is nothing compared to the profit the dupers get from selling the items.
---
I'm down
---
Once they've finished the major bug patches I'm hoping they'll move on to nameable stuff. Be good for the chassis as well as weapons. It's good that the developers of the game are fixing the game. The corporate heads tho I still dislike. 
---
Make your own story.
---
It's what I've always done on Fallout games. It's always been the most fun. 
---
Some people don't look so in depth at in game play choices, but it works for me.
---
In FO4 my characters always had different motivations for things. Different reasons to build up settlements. Reasons for not building them at all. A compulsive urge to collect hats, often recklessly....
---
It works well in 76. 
---
One of my characters is a water farmer. She's old and a rifle toting Western fan. She ain't giving up what's hers. Early on she had her home camp destroyed by some high level super mutants. It drove her to addiction. Which she eventually over came.
---
Except when she sees super mutants now. She loses the rifle , goes back to the drugs and goes into berserk melee mode. 
---
She got spunk.
---
Roleplaying a character isn't for everyone. It's easy for me because of D&amp;D, but it can be really great fun.
---
Just. Let. Me. Change. The. Damn. Jukebox. Music. From. Classical.
---
the Uranium Fever event also spawns usually 3-5 legendary mole miners in my experience
---
Yeah, 50 is the cap (pun intended) for everything else, why can’t it also apply to caps? 
---
I do my vendor trades daily, but 120 something caps per death is a bit excessive. 
---
Depends I guess I was one earlier and two people invited me. I’m very iffy of people so I kinda just didn’t think anything of it. Idk I was in a blast zone so maybe that’s why but still I’ve been playing since the beta and I’ve never gotten an invite before. I mostly just get random people who run up to me wave or just stare at me :/
---
I think they should thank us for not making so much noise about how the release date should have been this weekend.
---
I feel like making legendary mods craftable would be a good idea. Make them expensive. Expensive as needing specific drops.  And to add mods to a legendary, you need some of those ultra rare drops like mothman wing fragment or something like that.
---
And duping needs to be fixed before anything good can really be implemented.
---
There are a few really bad mutations, most are neutral or slightly beneficial, and some that are awesome.
---
Egghead, empath, heard mentality, and depending on your build twisted muscles have huge downsides that just aren't really worth the upsides if you aren't built around a super specific playstyle.
---
The only mutation with no downside to speak of is chameleon, otherwise you have to consider each one and whether it's good for your build, just having all of them for the sake of having them makes your character janky as all get out if you aren't built from the ground up around having all of them.
---
Log out and go to another server is the only way right now and block the griefers. 
---
Theres more than just Vault 96 suits. All of the vaults, have craftable suits for when they are open, dont need no dev room to figure that one out.
---
I vote the blatant cheaters get permanent ‘Wanted’ status. 
---
It would be fun. For me.
---
Sure your not thinking of the 76 one?.
---
Perfect. Its the frame part that i have missed
---
Best way is as soon as it happens, server hop, otherwise no.
---
It a hard compulsion to break after previous Fallout games. Totally understandable. 
---
If you can craft any of those weapons. Scrap em. It's easier to re craft them from junk, which takes up less inv space.
---
We need proof
---
Stupid question but how do you get your camp unit on top of your building like that?
---
That's a very fair assessment, which I'm sure we all can relate to. Mostly I feel I'm that person who's waving at you, but now I'm looking to establish with a group.
---
There is still so much to fix. For example they barely touched the graphical issues and the physics spasms. I still have the sun shining through the ground and enemies expanding into infinity.
---
Yeah with the number of bugs in FO76 I'm certain the entire player base has duped items unintentionally. I know I've duped acid before I knew it was a thing. I've duped diluted stimpacks without trying having given them all to my team mate for 0 caps and then still having them in my inventory. I also seemed to never need to pick up purified water, although someone pointed out this was possibly from completing events.
---
I get that's different from duping a trillion TSE shotguns but is it really? Exploiting exploits is an exploit.
---
As for posting the image, host it in Imgur. Com and post the link in a post. 
---
This is in much better detail and pretty much how i imagined it but one problem arises, what if half you friends play pvp characters wile the other half pve? This should be a interchangable option becuase im not leveling a new character just to play both sides.
---
That's just depressing, the fact that you can't avoid it unless you can actually see it happening and react fast enough. I get that the game needs the "drama", as Todd Howard puts it but at least let players opt out if they're not looking for a Rust clone. I just want to play alone, mind my own business and build my base. :/
---
That is bullshit.
---
For defense. Build a defense tower and protect your valuables/resources in it. Or devise some elaborate maze through available buildings. 
---
Or just aesthetics. I think the best way to Camp is to camp often and just document each build with photo and/or video   
---
Discover every map point and all the non mapped special locations.
---
Collect all the magazines/bobbleheads/costumes. 
---
Currently I'm trying to get every recipe. 
---
Have you checked the challenges? There's ones for catching every disease or taking pics at certain locations. This has kept me going when I get bored. 
---
I think it's good cos it encourages you to ration the space out. Tbh I would've preferred having a limit of like 100 per resources or something instead, so you always have a reason to be scavenging.
---
Well strangley u find that there are no reports on Reddit about it, so decide to let everyone know (maybe, just maybe ppl werent aware, and so now uve given ppl an incentive to go look it up, why not just upload instructions on how to do it while ur at it.)
---
If it were me, I would not have posted this on reddit, only reason I can think of you doing this is for karma. Instead report it to Bethesda with links of proof and leave it to them (yes they are most likely aware, yes they are banning ppl, but if you can provide more info on how people are doing it, then maybe they can implement a way to stop it).
---
Fyi, grape mentats exist, lol - I can craft those and Berry currently
---
I got it from an event drop
---
Yeah except you can't. Sure you can do all that while being railroaded or afterwards but there is one route to the end game and it involves joining certain factions
---
What happened on WoW or any other game when your friends are on a different server. Re-roll or pay transfer. Simple 
---
I sure do love this here idea.
---
Nope, nevermind, it's just a regular vault-tec suit.
---
Rotate it around and wiggle. That’s the best advice I can give. Also, try placing the gate first and be mindful of how deep into the ground it placed. I noticed they like to clip down for whatever reason. 
---
Its not like they have more than one team in the studio , that have different things to do
---
I've got 2.5k caps and a few 3* legendaries. Would all of that work? 
---
 Once a character is made on a PvP server it can’t play on a Pve server. Because it would be to easy to gather resources and materials on PVE and jump on to the PVP with a un fair advantage. It’s a paid service for most MMO to limit this effect 
---
Yeah; we are all waiting on this image now. Would love to see the specific wording etc. 
---
Just put the new metal armor paint scheme on it. 
---
Also, higher scaling raider armor would be nice, I'd outright prefer to have each suit have a different use.
---
Say, T-51 has good ballistic, T-45 has better energy, T-60 is balanced, X-01 has better rad&gt;T-60 but slightly less energy for more physical, etc.
---
It seems to be a common thread. Min/Maxers get bored quickly.
---
I assume you've done all the quests, side stuff, locations etc?
---

Have they fixed the antibiotics crafting bug?
---
Posted to r/gaming bc I’m lazy 
---
Yeah, had a similar experience with an AP explosive Gatling laser...very, very limited explosive proc for it (if any). Then I put a prime receiver on it.
---
Now it no longer shoots lasers, just ultracite “bullets” that explode. Kinda sorta an improvement? 
---
*Fixed an issue where a player made good use of a perk card. Devnote: go git TSE casul* 
---
Same! Picture the scene with me, Peter Pantsless, in Flatwoods the other day after accidentally shooting someone else's stairs while defending their vacant camp from Molerats: "Please! This isn't a trap! Just shoot me! I have no armour! Honestly, I just want rid of the bounty somewhere convenient! Please! Anyonnnneee?"
---
Have you ever seen the movie *Traitor* with Don Cheadle?
---
I don't care about the people it would piss  off. For every one of them, there are a half- dozen people who are more pissed off about entire teams of assholes who one- shot kill everything at events preventing others from gaining legendary items and XP. And if you are telling me it isn't because of duping, then you are being dishonest.
---
its not for karma
---
Beth already know how ppl entering, using CE teleport method
---
it cannot be patched that easily
---
i think community must aware about such things, people must open their eyes, i am the messenger who revealing the truth for everyone, and also i think its intersting topic to discuss
---
You make it seem like anyone actually takes workshops in this game. I've server hopped Poseidon for at least an hour today and out of 50 hops I would find it taken maybe 2 times at most 3 if the time of day is correct. If you want those workshops so badly on pve servers just change worlds chances are very high they wont be taken.
---
I'd love to see this feature implemented by Bethesda.

There’s definitely more of them bothering me these days, I had 3 attack me when I fast travelled to Lewisburg station, 1 that attacked and crashed my game because I was in the trade screen with the vendor at Sutton station, 1 that attacked when I was doing a bots on parade event at Berkeley Springs, I had 2 come at me at white springs golf club out of knowhere and I’ve seen someone else post that they had SB trouble at Sunnytop station. No idea what’s going on, but I don’t go to Lewisburg station to check his items anymore because there’s always at least 2 SB turn up and they soak up so much ammo with little reward just to find the vendor didn’t have the item you wanted anyway :(
---
"Decks" you mean, and I believe it's been suggested

This ability should be available, judgement free, irl ... 😈
---
Id rather start with a duplicate of my character on the other server so i have 2, just the dup has no points spent and no gear, just lvls, quest progression, and any plans unlocked 
---
I hear you regardning people walking or landning in front of me. If I am unloading with my TSE 50 cal when that happens I am insta dead. I prefer not using my TSE when playing with randoms.
---
Imo the normal two shot 50 cal/Gatling with or without prime receiver is overall great for SBQ. And TSE is basically just for cheesing the pleb monsters anyway.
---
I have lasers, plasmas and other heavy weapons but only the 2 mentioned can deliver whats needed, for now. It Will change though I am sure.
---
More high end content needed although I am still having fun but that is mainly due to a great team and overall great community.

you’re gonna have to come to me cause i cannot move at all. mine is luficr adding you now

Long term junk farm camp + Lucky break thingy perk cards 
---
Right, I don't really know for your current level of around 16, but once you hit 20/25 I know some great spots in the southeast of the map, the red cranberry bog area, where you can easily find a large number of different weapons for almost any playstyle, place is called abandoned bog town, it's along the north end of the highway, and as long as you're the first one to pass through in about an hour you should find many weapons around your level just sitting around. If you are on xbox I would gladly assist you in your journey, I could even pass off some things that you might find very useful. A big thing is to find some people to play with, they make the game so much easier and more enjoyable.
---
One other tip, there is a master of the pack event that spawns north west of the starter vault, and you can find several low level legendries by killing the special wolves that spawn.
---
i am near red rocket, i am loading in to u now

Gatling gun is very weird...400/500 fire rate between normal/speedy receivers but it fires slower than a .50 cal. Martial artist speeds it up nicely tho.

Wow. That is such total bullshit and anyone who has ever fought the queen knows it.  In just about any queen battle where her health depletes quickly, you see can see explosions from TSE weapons going off all around her as her health depletes.  What you have just said is just such utter nonsense. 
---
I’m on Xbox but after the P.C patch I spent last night crashing constantly like others have said, goodness only knows what’s going to happen when Xbox gets its update next week, I love some of the issues that are being addressed but with every patch I have more and more trouble staying connected to the game :(
---
Okay I dont really get that at all, there is absolutely zero good that can come out of it, so I can only assume ur one who just wants to shit on the game in any way u possibly can.
---
There are ways to explore the parts of the game that are locked away without 1. Getting banned and 2. Without ruining it for everyone else (ie. keep that shit out of the live client).
---
hold up, imma post that shit real quick on imgur ill hyu with a link 
---
Professional software engineer and developer here!
---
&gt; wouldn't it be possible to have the renaming functions of items client-side? 
---
Yes. In fact, as you point out, there's no need to have those shared with others, so this would be a pretty elegant solution. Not even a risk of seeing your previously custom-named objects on others, since players don't see them as discrete objects until they're dropped.
---
No need even to have a property on the object or a database linking UUIDs (Unique Universal Identifiers) with names. Easy peasy.
---
Explosives never seem to work for some reason.
---
It does some damage, if you use it definitely use demolition expert
---
Type writers, fishing rods desk fans pocket watches all have gears.
---
The best places Ive found so far are the charleston herald building has a lot of typewriters and fans, and the atlas observatory in savage divide.
---
On the bright side at least we don’t lose our builds. Sure we might need to gather a bit but it’s not like other games where what you built is utterly gone. I like to rebuild it while they’re still there and then log out. Shows how little it matters. 
---
Didn’t you hear? Wasteland Whisperer was affecting scorched enemies. Players have been screaming their heads off for weeks about this absolute travesty that made it in to the final release of this game. Finally, some balance is being restored to the tse wasteland 
---
Wendigo cave. PC platform. Can't even fully explore the cave before crashing. What is going on? I crashing once every 20 minutes while sneaking around inside.
---
just ban the duppers.. oh wait they r the 50% of game community...
---
I wondered if someone tried to nuke the queen? First nuke to spawn and second , launched within a minute, on the queen?
---
The replies to my comment are so loaded with bullshit that I am truly dumbfounded. You simply don't know what the hell you are talking about.  No one has to fight the queen to finish the story mode.  To finish the story mode, you launch a nuke at a target of your choosing.  Killing the queen is not even a story quest. It is an event quest and it even says so on the map while it is going on. 
---
I like this idea. Every other mmo has done exactly this and it's worked. Bethesda just wants to try to be special but instead of going towards they are going back. Most of their fanbase doesnt want pvp and that is why they play their single player games. If the casuals want to beat each other like cavemen then give them a server to do just that and let the rest of us enjoy the game.
---
news can be good or bad, accept it and move on you you dont like bad news - dont read them
---
Not a single mod for me.
---
I generally only keep those quantities in my stash. 
---
Wouldn't be surprised if it was duping if you're on console.
---
Patch is supposed to fix duping. So console dupers will be hard at it until it drops.
---
Dont use the MIVR  mod its need alot of work, you can blow yourself up for no reason 50% of the time.
---
This is why I spent shitload of time to find a place with all the amenities I want and literally 0 traffic. Have not seen one person there who wasn't invited for a trade. And not even once I got a "we cannot place your camp" message.
---
On PC. Yeah crashed a few more times than usual today. 
---
Also killed a scorch beast queen with never ending inventory loading and stuck on loading screens. 
---
I love this game but my patience is wearing thin!!!
---
Thanks :)
---
This is best explanation of this that I've ever seen (probably for good reason as not to spread how it works before it's fixed)
---
Same thing happened to me I was severing hopping a random of my friends list joined and it was just me and him it was kinda depressing 
---
all duped items must be removed from the game. those all have the same stats like durability, legendary effects. i can make a script in 5 min what can clean up the palyers inventory from duped items.
---
it *did* make a difference, I disconnect much more frequently than before now. :)
---
Except sometimes others have tbe exact same thing in mind and there is nothing there so finding an untouched area migh take awhile
---
when u buy tse weapon for 300-1000cp u know its duped.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/MvDJhfM
---
RRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGGHHHHHH!
---
Sometimes an area is so nice on its own I’ll just plop down two tents off to the side and out my sleeping bags and crafting stuff inside. Still feels kind of like a shelter but looks more like a proper camp in the wilderness. Throw out some lanterns and a camp fire 10/10. 
---
so if i understand correctly - everything in game is just shortcuts, shortcuts with a path to that room right?
---
when you looting smthing or receiving reward - game taking an item from dev room and "dupin" it to player
---
I have more than double that and I got it through legitimate means. 
---
Legendary items aside, unless they're in the thousands, I tend to assume that it was legitimately gotten.
---
People have posted about this a few times, apparently it works.
---
PC and just 15 minutes ago. I’m guessing he was just worried as he got a bounty on him and didn’t want to risk losing his stuff. But why go to MSS and stick it in a Chem box?
---
Excellent
---
Only buff of low levels is below level 5 where you are immune to pvp damage or something like that, but your camp is not, also there were ways if you shoot car next to low level player, explosion could kill him.. Well I don't say to not implement this, I only say what should be dealt with first before implementing this..  
---
My opinion of placing camps so far away from each other is just this, so players can spawn battle fortress next to someone else to have upper hand, not just stability issues...
---
Yes, it was worse for me last night. Most annoying, that I got DC'ed and rolled few minutes back twice while doing my vendor trail.
---
Do the right thing and destroy it.
---
Now try finding a moderate among the maze of vault boys.
---
i destroyed most of it that wasn’t even half. at least i’m not sellin it, im helping out the youth
---
Has anyone completed the Early Warnings quest post-patch and still not received it as a quest reward?
---
Do what I do. 
---
Get rid of all your junk, spawn at either Phoenix at Watoga or the TotW railway naked, and go have a coffee. 
---
Bount will be gone by the time you’re back. 
---
Define blatant cheaters - you talking dupers or people playing in a different play style to you?
---
Literally unplayable. /s
---
Lol well thanks but what I meant was your post was a much needed change from the usual hate or complaints on this subreddit lol. Keep up the good fight for justice!
---
lol so basically 
---
&gt; and also i think its intersting topic to discuss 
---
Was a crock of shit then, coz im trying to discuss with you, and ur basically telling me to buzz off, unless of course discussion means, not discussing the ethical side of posting this, or the ethical side of hacking into those areas in a live client, etc. etc.
---
Shit, that's good!
---
Go on, take the upvote. 
---
Well, I'm trying to make room in my inventory, so more legendary gear would hurt rather than help. I'm really only hunting for armor and plans at the moment.
---
But...if you took the materials, then you're using duped materials!
---
OH LMAO, tHANKS. i’m giving back to the fellow youth
---
May I have the Xbox code please?
---
Not true.
---
Bethesda straight up said that mods are not yet officially supported and to use them at your own risk.
---
But there are players who did not use Cheat Engine or other such things and were banned when only using 3rd party mods.
---
Bethesda has not yet responded to their claims.
---
Juicehead literally put out a news segment update about it here about 1-2 days ago.  You can view that here:  
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgggTaZ6RMc&amp;t=511s
---
Bethesda even in their announcement said, that if those players had been banned for mods, they needed to contact support. So that by itself confirms players were banned for using mods and yet, there's been no replies from Bethesda on the issues of those players nor have their bans been lifted.
---
Just warning you it HAS happened.
---
The counter to this is often Mr. Howard's statement that they support mods and their modding community, so it is OK to use them.  While that IS true, he is referring to mods they officially support and endorse the use of, WHEN they come to the game.
---
It's been weeks since launch and the mods and their creations ever grow and yet not a peep from Bethesda if we can actually use them safely in their game has been confirmed.
---
The only official statement we got was they were not officially supported and can break things.  That's a hands off statement that means nothing.
---
This means that mods are not officially supported and you are using them at your own risk.
---
Well, after 100+ hours, i'm still waiting a simple explosive affix for any weapon. I'm not even talking about TSE.
---
i don't get how you drop that much TSE but you're lucky AF !
---
"I destroyed most of the stolen iPhones. At least I'm not making money off them. Helping out the kids".
---
You're not on the right side of this issue.
---
I thought they meant item level not player level. I thought before it took the same to repair a level 1 leather armour piece as a level 50 piece 
---
Or he was seeding the location for newer players
---
Or just dumping excess adhesive (chuckle).
---
i got it, you are troll
---
Got a hanging deathclaw on my profile) 
---
complain on someone else’s post? i don’t care fam.
---
It would be NICE to color format them or something for the vegetarian and carnivore perks.
---
Great job. Seriously.
---
If you read all the threads on this, the only confirmed bans have been Cheat Engine. I’d rather play on multi-monitor than not play, so I’m fine with the risk and will just buy it again, worst case.
---
Not sure, but I check regularly after each patch in editor and still no change there..
---
The calibers in FO are guidelines at best. How can 5mm from a mini gun to 22 points of damage but from a gattling do 300?
---
This happened today I traded my friend bobble heads for 50 caps halfway through trading he's already bought 2 bobble heads then I crash I log back in and still have the meele bobble heads he took but the game still took my caps
---
Hmmm are you sure? I think low levels have a damage buff when fighting high levels. Otherwise it would be a slaughter.
---
You seem to be missinformed.
---
I don’t know what else you’d call it...indefinite suspension?
---
Yes, for me it's also lightning-fast now. Samsung m.2 SSD.
---
Once instead of fast travel it just showed me a black screen, and I was still at my previous location at the map - had to do the fast travel again, lol. Never happened before the patch.
---
No, he's not getting it. Once you place a frame, you cannot PUT the pieces that are too high level for you on the frame. It simply doesn't work. 
---
However, you can store those armor pieces in your stash box. I do that too on a new character, slowly assemble next-tier power armor parts. It's probably common. Does take a lot of space tho.
---
My god thats rich, coming from the obvious troll in the room, Im merely wanting to have a discussion about it as u said u think its an interesting topic to discuss, and yet ur doing everything u can to avoid discussing, makes me think u were only interested in a quick karma hit, or to try sew dissent into the community, hence who is the bigger troll here? certainly is not me.
---
People actually thanking devs for fixing a game that was complete bunk on release hahaha. It should be a given. You don't feel grateful getting your car fixed if it was broken on purchase.
---
You're getting deluded by game developers. Wake up and realise how much bullshit it is this happened in the first place.
---
Blah blah blah like your tldr post
---
Best use of rock-out pose so far
---
I mean, it could still be. They said they fixed duping a couple other times and people found other ways/Figured out the added step.
---
You don't have to do nuke zones.  Nothing is required.  Plans/loot from the "Endgame" are all tradeable.  Nothing forces you anywhere.
---
you can edit your post and include this link: https://i.redd.it/19peo5lunr921.jpg to the image.
---
so you just confirmed you are troll, but not so big as me huh?
---
Yeah I also got rolled back too which was annoying, I even had finally decided to drop all my useless notes/holotapes after carefully sorting through them, then bam, they're all back and I don't wanna go through them again lol.
---
Don't waste mods on lvl 30 version. You can collect them now but save them for you end game set. Feel free to use any duplicates you get though.
---
Wasn’t this picture the same one posted to a Facebook fallout group a while ago today, but just cropped? Not original. 
---
Just stating what's going on bro.  You do, you.
---
Very nice, look of it blends in perfectly with the area. Would not have guessed it was a player camp as I approached it.
---
Also ouch at the 10k caps letters. I need to stop buying random crap like pawned legendaries to screw around with and save, the daily sales limit is annoying as hell.
---
well u accused me of being one, so im just saying if anyone is a troll its u, and \*if\* i am supposedly one, then ur the bigger one, does that make sense? or should I spell it out for you. Tho i grow weary of this conversation, obviously u dont give a shit about the community or the game, so I will take my leave.
---
Yeah, I suppose that's true. But I had just spent all of my resources on completing the base so I was SOL. :(
---
The game was running so much smoother last night, shorter load times when fast traveling too. 
---
Good job with the patch!
---
I play daily from 745 am cst to 10 am cst.
---
extended hours Monday and Tuesdays 
---
You're on PC, right?
---
Good day sir!
---
I've had their caps refill on occasion too so it isn't all bad, unfortunately that's no as common.
---
All duped items should be deleted.
---
So....if I go and buy the car, and it turns out that let's say transmission isn't working properly and it takes the dealer almost 2 months to fix it, I should be THANKING them every time they make some progress on it? Fuck right off.
---
Thank them for what? For releasing unplayable game, screwing people over at every turn ( canvass bags, nuka rum, whatever the fuck else ) and not attempting to even rectify the situation until they were staring at the lawsuit? Yes, let me go and kiss  Todd Howards feet right now. 
---
I hope that whenever Todd Howard goes in front of investors/shareholders or whatever they got going on over there, that they pull the plug on this dumpster fire. 
---
Then, and only then will I thank them for putting this shit show out of it's misery.
---
Yeh I make the majority of my caps on here selling guns/ammo or anything people will pay for lol
---
Yeah I've sold/dumped so many .... though in fairness I've never needed to carry more than 10 anyway .
---
Check your inventory again - there are a couple of bugs with this IIRC, one of them being it will consume a motor for the parts when you craft them. I believe folks have reported the best thing to do is craft and turn in one at a time? Is that possible?
---
Don't you dare speak ill of bobby pin weight change. This is my new accepted currency for trades now.
---
Thanks for fixing the scrapping Mods at the same time as Hardened Mass.....ah no not yet.  Okay I'll thank you later for not seeming to take a scatter gun approach to which things you fix.  Thanks.
---
This is supposedly a long term project. We can hope that as add-in come out Faction choices will add up. 
---
In my mind ( and maybe wrongly ) this is the prologue ... now just enjoying my spare time as I wait for The Rest of The Story.
---
I agree this is how they will clear out the dupes. New areas with higher level Mobs and more difficult events. Introduce higher level weapons and 4 star legendaries while continuing to hunt down duping exploits. 
---
what platform are you on?
---
Those are different weapons though.
---
Yeah, I get the real world implications of firing the same round in different devices but I'm not looking for the same damage as a pipe revolver or combat rifle. Just something that's at least better than the .38 receivers. It's not even better than like half the .38 receivers.
---
Maybe they are sick and tired of selfush prick dupers and dupe supporters damaging the game
---
A few people seem to use Moonshine Shack to trade stuff to their alts. It only works if you already have a friend on the server and can join their party, so you get the same server your stuff is on. You leave the vault and run right to the shack and pick the stuff up. I don't think adhesive is a popular duping item though.
---
Wow very nice! 
---
My most favourite part of this sub reddit was always seeing the camps people built. It was always good to see original ideas and cool concepts. These days all we hear and see is creative builders bases being blown up be griefers. It's a real pity.
---
....except for turret bases at the back if the golf course, feel free to blow them up.
---
People crouching do not show on the map. 
---
I spend an inordinate amount of time crouched ... as do others. 
---
I think I had hundreds of hours sneaking around in FO4.
---
I thought it only affected the durability of dropper loot?
---
Yup.  250 hardly seems suspicious.  
---
I feel ya. Just remember that as much as it sucks to rebuild sometimes, you’ll never be as pathetic as the kid that kicks over other people’s sandcastles for fun. The creators keep moving forward and the destroyers just kind of fade away because in the end nobody really likes them. Or not since the anonymity brings out the worst in some otherwise normal people lol. 
---
I’m on PC if you need any supplies. I just donated like 3-500 of random materials to some rando newbie because I legit just don’t have room and I’m happy with my camp for a whole lol. 
---
Luck of the character plays no part in the items that will drop, only the durability.
---
I’ve DCd two days in a row trying to do Heart of the Enemy for my first time. It sucks. 
---
You could walk around a bit. I think Northish and find the Breaking Bad Easter Egg ...
---
It spawned a new queen for us, so we fought two at one time. But the second queen didn't have an event associated with her
---
Yes thats that I thought too.
---
I really hope that they will drop the hammer, hard.
---
Perk share working again for me on Jan 10 patch. Patch has no mention of the issue, anyone still having the bug?
---
Ok so a lot of YouTubers are talking out there ass agein then. Wow YouTube been so unreliable latly 
---
If you’re a Bethesda employee giving me specific advice, blink twice. Otherwise, I’m cool.
---
No, you're right. We shouldn't celebrate the fix of a years-long bug or something that is a pet peeve for some people.
---
Let's not take the victories where we can but instead only wait for the big ones before begrudgingly acknowledging that things are f-fractionally better. B-baka!
---
It's really annoying to farm that mod... In general PA armor mods are too hard to find. They should be listed more often in the various vendors... And if you think X-01 is hard try getting mods for the Excavator Power Armor!
---
Same here (on PC). :(
---
That really should not surprise you
---
Ohhh, that's funny. I would think that nuke should kill the first one:)
---
I've heard that the SBQ has an 80% resistance to explosions.
---
This!
---
Well youtube used to be my go to information for games now I use Reddit as I not only get a quick reply but really great advice too
---
PC: Found a Gov't Aid Drop that was locked (0-level, but still...)
---
Picking it gave me the "you've been caught, owner is hostile" message.
---
Also, lawl at the plan inside.... yeesh
---
[https://imgur.com/a/uHv99Tf](https://imgur.com/a/uHv99Tf)
---
might be better to farm random event for the skeleton costume plan. afterwards you just need to craft them and sell them at \~50\~60 caps to vendors.
---
I am never sure, I am level over 100 now, it's long time since level 5 and also something might change recently, but still I don't know anything about damage buff never saw that or ever heard of. I know only that below level 5 you are immune to player damage and pacifist mode is enabled for you, though don't know if you can disable it (don't think so though).  
---
Also for this same reason it is not possible to launche nukes on forest area, because it is starting point for low level players (not only level 1 - 5, but also later levels have less chances against level 50+ equipped with power armors and explosive weapons)
---
Well I never really relied on Youtube, but my understanding is that it has pretty much just boiled down to a bunch of click bait videos, with only very few reliable sources left, so yeah Reddit is probably a better choice, altho u get ur fair share of dicks on here, but also a lot more helpful nice people
---
There are more obvious ulterior motives with Youtube. Karma is hardly something worth farming for upvotes.
---
This game on PS4 is barely playable... I keep getting blue screen errors and when I don't I get server disconnections.
---
It's literally unplayable for me :-(
---
Oh I had that two days ago had to delete the post it was that bad. 
---
Scaly skin finally works. Yay.
---
I don't know why, but my dumbass didn't realize this was fake until you hit the million mark.
---
Lol, I have a small adhesive farm and I throw the stuff away all the time.
---
Caution bursting range exceeds throwing range. 
---
Even if I were, I couldn't tell you.
---
Goood riddance!
---
I don't think I've used anywhere near 172 in 200+ hours of playing.
---
Probably best you have caps instead of them honestly.
---
Level 40's? - a lot are weildable at 45 but can't pretend I've ever seen one using one sub about mid 50's? 
---
The scaling caps has never bothered me as caps are so easy to farm once you have 7 vendors. The flexibility of perks swapping makes things so easy generally.
---
It used too, but was fixed in a previous patch she became immune to nukes
---
For anyone wanting the real story: https://segmentnext.com/2019/01/09/bethesda-is-now-going-after-youtubers/
---
You sound like someone after a more guided experience. Have you tried meditating at the Palace?
---
Seems more like a mule/hoarder than a duper but it is just my guess :).
---
Yeah, I'm on PC but I don't think more supplies would help, I'm shit at organizing, mys stash is overflowing with junk. LOL!
---
If anyone does want to play, my name on the Bethesda launcher is (appropriately) Notrealfallout.
---
I don’t see it 
---
In PVP damage scales depending on your level.... Low levels have a buff vs high levels.
---
How does it break barbarian
---
Any super sledge mods? 
---
Just watch out for SB spawns. I usually end up fighting them in pairs there ... because I was there to use those repair benches!
---
I'd gladly share some pics of my bases. Was really proud of the previous one before it got bugged out and I had to construct my current base instead. 
---
Yeah a duper would have 1000000x that amount.
---
Punctuation is hard.
---
So I just noticed in the patch notes that apparently the Gauss wasnt getting use out of the rifle perks but now they work for it so maybe I'll try it out and get a stealth torso for the X-01 and put the jetpack on as a favorite to just swap when i need it. I think I'll try a build around the gauss and the new legendary rifles since I'm getting bored and if it doesnt work out I still have all my heavy weapons stuff that barely weighs anything with 60% wep weight reduced armor pieces I'd just need to swap a few perk points around.
---
Yeah from some of the items datamined from this patch and stuff in game already i feel like there is still alot to be released which is a good thing but at this point I feel like there just isnt much to the story at all as if this is only "chapter 1" of a longer story.... hopfully...
---
Yeah, help keeping people occupied with grinding cause what else is there to do? 
---
They should really focus theyr efforts on pve content otherwise that game will die out pretty soon.
---
Very nice, I used to be right by there in the river, great spot! 
---
Just the other night I couldn't find a single other player on the map... It was an all-nighter before I noticed
---
Always a pain to lose a good build but then fun to make a new one :P
---
Amen, at the very least there should be more variety from each instance of the vendor. If I had a dollar for every motion assist servo plan I've seen I could probably afford everything in the atom shop.
---
To be honest once I found out I could scrap junk my stash has been perfect some advice drop anything below your level (except things that you really like or remind you of a adventure for example I keep a level 1 miners pick cause it belongs to the overseers ex husband 😭😢 I was sad that day) drop any chems you don’t use (I just use radaway and stimpacks so I literally got so much weight of my stash) and lastly start crafting things and once you think you can stop cause you have everything you want just bet items that will repair your armor and weapons drop any junk that you never use 
---
any thoughts on better matchmaking on servers? As a lowly level 26 it's kinda hard to beat lvl 60+ monsters because there are a couple of 150 people running around on the other side of the map. The monsters seem to scale up very rapidly if there are high-level players in the map but not near you. 
---
Give in, embrace the weight, mold yourself around it, find enlightenment in travelling the slow winding roads of peace and tranquility. 
---
I quit fighting the weight limit a long time ago, mostly, sort of, Now I fight the super encumbered weight limit that is at 4x you normal weight limit, and I've been carrying an unperked amount of over 3000 weight since I was about level 50, and I have found the game so much more enjoyable for it, I pass through areas most people will simply fast travel past, and get to see the world go by at a leisurely pace.
---
That does not mean I don't make extensive use of brute force economy of motion to get where I'm going in good time and stay a step ahead, My team mates who aren't encumbered don't exactly leave me behind easily just because I move through the world efficiently and know where I am going well in advance so I don't have to stop constantly for things like food, water, or other slow downs.
---
ADVICE TIME
---
1. move to the cranberry bog, take up one of three major areas, either in the vicinity of watoga, old mold quarry, or the ranger office. why these spots you may ask. Tarberries, cooking tarberries into juice gives you an extremely efficient stamina regenerator for being on the move, I have 9 patches in close proximity to my home, and with green thumb + super duper start the day with around 30 juices at the ready, twice that if I make some before logging out and then when logging in, put these on your hotbar and you can run for days without stopping.
---
2. get starched genes, marsupial, and speed demon, these things make navigating the world so much easier you won't be able to live without them.
---
3. learn the many small time savers, when you need to get something in inventory don't stop and do it all at once, run till your stamina stops, then move closer to it in inventory, then start moving again when your stamina is back to not waste time you can be moving. Use the quick version of the pip-boy, it saves time, lets you see your surroundings while in menu, and doesn't show other players when you are in your menus, and when you don't have other things to get stamina back with the crouch while aiming down sites in first person allowing you to regenerate stamina without stopping, it doesn't seem like much but trust me, every second gained counts.
---
4. learn the best material dense areas, and hit them at the start of each day while travelling your normal routes, I live near bog town so I can raid the typewriter room for springs, screws, gears, and lead every day, and have never ran into major issues acquiring them because I keep a reliable stash.
---
5. Keep only valuables that are hard to replace in your stash, I keep only like 30 steel and wood in there and the rest one me, who cares if someone wants to rob me of 800 steel, i'll just go get 800 more.
---
6. Ge a set of excavator armor, yeah the 100 carry weight is awesome, but even when you have calibrated shocks for other armor keep it on you so you can harvest 4x from resource nodes in the world, ores are not junk, and don't drop when you die, so keeping 800 lead ore on you and only converting as you need can save a lot of hassle down the road, trust me. Also keep ore supplies of lead, iron, gold, and nuclear, the first two because you need them in large amounts and the latter two because they can really help in a pinch. 
---
7. don't stop doing basic inventory management like keeping supplies of low value scrap in check, cloth, leather, and glass will keep magically filling your inventory if you don't purge them like bacteria.

8. Make use of the option having more gives you. I carry a lot of weapons. I carry for reference, 2 50cal, 2 broadsiders, daisy cutter, bunker buster, 5 super sledges, 3 sledge hammers, an auto grenade launcher, 2 handmades, 2 assault rifles, two lever rifles, some revovers, a combat rifle, 4 dragons, 2 BP rifles, 3 bp pistols, 3 machetes, 2 gatling guns, a 10mm smg, 2 10mm pistols, 4 gatling plasmas, a plasma rifle, tesla rifle, grog's axe, fire axe, power fist, double barrel, combat shotty, minigun, hundred or so grenades, mines, and a couple other odds and ends. I got more hammers than most people have weapons, and can out last and outshoot a whole horde without any sort of worry about weapons breaking. Make use of your ability to leverage your supplies to spend huge lengths of time on exploration missions without having to stop for repairs constantly, I can loop around the whole map, visit every vendor, workshop, and still have working weapons when I get back to my base.
---
9. Have fun, that is the most important advice anyone can give you.
---
I had a hard time getting Adhesive during the early game.. But now I had 500 of the stuff and was forced to dump some of it.. I tried putting in in a location that some new players will find it. My point is, 250 adhesive is not really that much, so it's feasible that a player just did it to free up stash space. 
---
Please dont commit the same error that thousands of players committed in PUBG which is thinking that because they are releasing bug fixes or even skins they are not working on the hacks issue as well. 
---
Real life is not like Fallout Shelter where you have 10 workers and you go sendign them to fix stuff and you have to wait until they finish to put them work in the armory. Bethesda has an specific team for hacks issues the problem here is how efficient they are so please let them at least fix bugs while they look for a solution.
---
PC was totally stable, running smooth and shorter load times when fast traveling last night. No issues at all. 
---
I was checking bunkers out in cranberry bog yesterday and was attacked by a 3* hermit crab. Almost had it dead and 2 more turned up that were 3* as well killed the first one and started to work on other 2 with nades the a bloody legendary alpha deathclaw turned up. Was like fuck this and legged it lol
---
Im still not even sure if I understood that correctly. 
---
So it was a queen drop while:
---
- having a special quest with 8 people max 
---
- you made it Solo
---
- you didn’t?
---
You see.... still confused
---
Nope not from my tries at least, I believe the only 2 mods for the super sledge is heated coils and the concrete block that I've only seen on the legendary All Rise.
---
Well they had it coming, posting a vid of yourself in a public domain using exploits, what did they expect? 
---
With luck? Till everyone who exploited their way to the top is gone.
---
i killed him while he was in his stash, who knows what else he had or on his buddy. 😔 i am burdened by the weight tho 
---
Right but if the player who duped or whaled is just doing pve, that is not a huge problem to me.
---
Honestly, if the guy even has two or three of the exact same weapon stacked, they're not legit.
---
How an Enclave and Responder would actually react. Quite like it 
---
💅 damn u right
---
Does, does that kill you? I always thought it just removes visibility and shakes the camera too much.
---
Not far enough I fear...
---
Damn are those keyboards annoying especially when you're used to QWERTY. The frenchies just had to change the layout, didn't they?
---
This is only a good sign, I mean they will speak publicly about it, they are youtubers. But how many may have been banned who haven't spoken about it
---
Are you sure? I mean this is not game like eso or swtor where you have to get such buff. Fallout damage system works differently than those games, though I do not participate in PvP, so whatever, I won't be arguing about this.
---
Well I'm from Belgium so I'm used to it. But I admit I don't understand why they did that.
---
Such realism. 
---
ASM in Watoga has close to 10.
---
Guards are all robots for lead/steel/circuits. 
---
Yeah, I get they had to add all of their És and Às but at least don't change the actual character layout
---
Umm U/TheArgentOne , I know this is off topic but... there's a cloning machine at r/DankMemesFromSite19 and I am Bright number 4, now there are 4 (or more) 963s. Just wanted to notify you. Best regards, Parallel Bright.
---
But, what about Workshops? Would they work in PVE?
---
Hmmm, immune to nukes, but killable by a guy with deathclaw gauntlet. Sounds legit ;)
---
I got a TSE minigun I unloaded on multiple non hostile players and I would have to shoot 2,500 bullets just to get them halfway.
---
Try painting the armor. Frames will have paint name on them after that.
---
I'm even 105 and yet i still figure "that dude is probably bait with a friend who is teamed but hidden who will whip out a tse and kill me for my caps."
---
Is this a bit... humiliating? This is not "I was wrong, here are my apologies." It is absolutely their mistake that I politely and in detail tried to explain to the support three weeks ago. And since then — not a single response.
---
And, of course, I find it a bit cynical to demand to write an essay from a person with a hand tremor, for whom English is not native.
---
Poseidon is one of the less taken workshops. Try with Charleston Landfill or the farm above it.
---
I attacked a  wanted player who was at there camp and my teammate started shredding up their camp so I took my teammate out because it was a dick move but he was just trina  get wanted lol
---
This is the same unverified “ESO team” story posted a couple of days ago.
---
That or the witch costume. Whichever they get first. Farmed the random event for days and only got the witch plan after a long time
---
yeah I'm pretty sure... Many a griefer ended on the wrong side of a lvl 10 shotgun.
---
I have like a thousand adhesive earned legit by living in cranberry bog, there's these red plans that give 4 adhesive when harvested, and double with green thumb, in verdant season with green thumb each plant gives 16! adhesives, which if you harvest let's say 10, is 160 adhesives, and if you know where to look you can easily gain more than that in 10 minutes.
---
War. War never ends
---
Mini nuke doesn’t have any burst dps against the queen, especially when compared to melee or ultracite weapons. Against the queen, you need to me able to sustain a minimum 2000 dps for 5 minutes to take her down
---
I tried to find some other means of communication: now it is only tickets through the support site and email from which the blocking notification has come. There is no answer to emails and tickets are deleted or closed "as a duplicate" without any comment.
---
If you know any other way to communicate with them, I will definitely try to use it.
---
You on PC? Just starting to wonder if the patch might have changed that
---
I don't use my power armor ever except in nuke zones. 
---
If anything, this game has less railroading than Fallout 4 and definitely less than Fallout 3. 
---
You could just literally just run around exploring and killing stuff forever. 
---
For aluminum I would head to the Top of the World.   All the ski poles are aluminum and there are quite a few of them.
---
This sounds like witch hunt and crying wolf
---
That's not a duper.
---
It's just a legit mule of any random hoarder.
---
Dupers don't dupe common components, they dupe top arms, armours, plans….
---
So hard to understand?
---
It’s a nice boost for a level 14 that’s for sure.
---
why u all mad, point is i got all this junk anyone wants? 
---
idc who i killed. duper, mule, stupid player? who gives a shit? i certainly don’t. 
---
Platform, If you are on xbox I would love to get a jetpack, materials provided myself of course.
---
Watoga rooftops with a couple server hops is an easy T60 game.
---
This is... much worse than I thought. If you can get a ban just because the Cheat Engine is installed, then I have no idea how to play this game at all. Use a virtual machine, maybe? But even this can be considered cheating — what if I have Wireshark running at host system?
---
You need caps to fast travel to vendors to sell to, js. Unless you’re on a team with very advantageous camp placement, plus vault 76? 
---
Not factoring in buying any bulk or plans. 
---
If you run in to it dose it fall over that would be satisfying to see them fall like Dominos
---
I'm on Xbox, gamertag is "Frostye Freeze"
---
Cry me a river
---
I'm still getting a damage bug with my guass rifle were i will do a large amount of damage then most of it will be instantly healed my the enemy.  This is the same bug that was fixed right? 
---
Haven't check since yesterdays patch
---
That patch hasn't hit consoles yet.
---
Issue isn’t slap damage it’s the bobble heads and magazine exploits 
---
I've contacted a dev. After login today I'm now also stuck in a invisible PA which seems to not even drain fusion cores. Can't jump in a new one or exit mine.     
---
      
---
Thanks for the advices. I'm sure they had helped if my inventory wasn't that much overloaded. With this method I could get rid of 100+ item ids.
---
&gt;Weapons: Fixed an issue that would sometimes cause plasma weapons, flamers and flamer mods, and weapons with explosive bullet mods to not do damage to other players and creatures.
---
that's honestly all I needed
---
Yup but it let's you use up more common ammo.
---
At level 70+ I've hardly found any .38. It's mostly . 45 now. 
---
Kinda love this and yes all their accounts were banned not just the one doing the glitch LOL
---
Queen Scorchbeast? You had one job...
---
I’ve known dupers to super junk, it’s not uncommon. 
---
But again why should we thank them for something that should have been in the base game to start with? Why should we thank them for finally giving us something that was already in fallout 4?
---
Oh I am so hoping you are right. 
---
i did use both fatman and mirv on separate occasions, fatman- about 16 missiles and mirv with 6 or 7 - no negligible damage. (without explosive perks)
---
When SPECIAL values hit fractional values some perks break and no longer function at all.
---
Fractional stats result in it not working, or did. Say you have HM with Class Freak, it ends up being -.25 to STR, which results in 0 DR from Barbarian. Same with Egghead-&gt; -.75 STR.
---
then what about flatwoods monster lava lamp. i mean in using his helmet as a lava lamp
---
Don't get me wrong, in some situations it's been pretty helpful with sniping, but yeah for the most part it feels incredibly awkward 
---
You need to get the Excavator power armor, it come with the plans for the station.  
---
[https://twinfinite.net/2018/11/fallout-76-excavator-power-armor-how-get/](https://twinfinite.net/2018/11/fallout-76-excavator-power-armor-how-get/)
---
I think weight in TES/Fallout games have never really been actual weight. To me the numbers always made more sense when I think of the stat as a combo between weight, and size/bulk. Which explains why at least some items that are technically light sometimes have a higher encumberance number.
---
But even with that in mind we can still carry dozens of rifles and 50 grenades along with everything else so it still doesn't make sense. Not to mention relative weights are all over the place, and things like long barrels on most weapons have LESS weight than short barrels.
---
Additionally the reason we need to carry a large police station's worth of arms and armor around is because we get so little materials from scrapping stuff, along with not getting even a single screw or spring from an entire rifle or minigun.
---
The whole thing needs a good readjustment.
---
What was his account name?  If he was banned it won’t matter.  Or keep pretending this was real 
---
Congratulations you defeated the final boss battle. You have won the game.
---
I don’t know where I can find the patch notes, can anyone link them for me?
---
It works but you have to shoot at an angle... The fatman doesn't fly straight it has a curve.
---
Ah thank you for a very detailed reply. 
---
I have all rifle perks saved from prevoius build but i Will stick to heavy a bit lounger before respecc again. Time consuming now with new XP gain and my somewhat high level.
---
I Will push my rifle friend to take my two shot gauss though and try it out. He uses Classic rifles only atm.
---
Exactly my issue last night, I thought I was going mad. Ended up turning it all off and going to bed lol. 
---
Update: after cleaning all my mutations, i could get all of them, so looks like i had them, but were not visible
---
Fake.  No account names,  no real emails, no proof. No reason to redact the YouTube names either if they originally posted themselves.  Stop with this fake shit.
---
Great I was so sick and tired of having to re-equip my grenades every time I logged in.
---
To be fair, consoles (especially PS4) seem to suffer more game crashes and server disconnects than PC. I am on PC and it annoys me, so some bitching is permitted..  
---
hahahahahha i was launching these fuckers with a MIRV attachment the other day. nothing pisses off other players like me dropping mininukes in their face for 30 minutes straight.
---
 @ other guy saying "dont use the mirv" no. just follow the same common sense as you learned in FO4 : aim upwards, and stand on top of something.
---
Fixed it :P
---
Exactly my thoughts...
---
hop
---
It took me a while to realize there was a pacifist mode
---
Doubtful.  Post their names.  Post screenshots of the map.  And their names.  
---
Considering there's been probably more than 10 posts about it since the update as people don't seem to scroll through or search for posts... yes 
---
This and the team invites not working.
---
Have you ever head of material penetration in ballistics ? Look it up.
---
SERVER NOT RESPONDING. CONTROLS HAVE BEEN TEMPORARILY DISABLED
---
Happened to me in the Bog. Must’ve been like whack-a-mole for that scorch beast. 
---
Yeah, it's completely absurd but that's the mentality of these fools.
---
I run an insanely low health build and usually find armor that has the add +3 to all special except end when low on health. 
---
My mod is better than your mod:

i read somewhere luck of the draw has a chance per pellet
---
Thru-Hiker Rank 3 - keep food and water on you. Dog food works great with Good Doggy and it is everywhere. It doesnt drop if you die. 
---
Traveling Pharmacy Rank 3 - keep chems and stims on you or sell. They dont drop if you die. 
---
Mini-Nukes weigh 6 lbs - unless you use a Fatman all the time drop them. You can make them later very easily if you want. 
---
Missiles weigh 2 lbs - same as Mini-Nuke. 
---
Fusion Cores weigh 3 lbs - Batteries included perk rank 3 - if you feel the need to stockpile them. The dont drop if you die. 
---
Junk goes in stash - 50 of some, 100 for most ... 200 for the hard to get. 
---
Bulk aluminum, lead and steel it helps. 
---
If you have ammo you are not using then drop it. You do not need to save fuel if you are not using a Flamer. 
---
I have a hundred or so costumes, 5 Power Armor Frames and 7 - 8 (various types) weapons in my stash following the above. 
---
I can repair everything cheaply (because I use the repair perks). I have surplus. I hover between 560 - 600 and only ‘manage it’ for 30 seconds or so every few days to ensure I have stock to repair. 
---
Just my take.
---
So it actually do stuff? Whenever I attack it just disappears. 
---
Still explodes for some reason when you shoot it in a angle off a bridge.
---
You can turn on the Minutemen you don't have to help them.
---
You do need to help the BoS as far as I can tell to access the Institute but the flaming wreck of the Prydwin shows you don't have to stay loyal. Like I said, guided. In FO76 you have to do as they say. 
---
There is plenty to do in FO76 and I've been having a blast doing it. I'd found the Whitesprings bunker long before I accessed it in story mode. Quite literally I play FO games as literally a Lone Wanderer moving all over the map before following the storyline.
---
But anyway I was just saying how I felt. If you felt differently then that's cool I suppose. 
---
u/LadyDevann
---
Hey bro any chance they could check this out and hopefully get a hotfix.
---
If I’m over encumbered from a new weapon I immediately scrap my gauss. Makes life easier. 
---
If I get good service then I will, shouldn't be any different in regards to videogames.
---
You can’t gain 1800 caps per hour, as Vendor limit makes excess irrelevant.
---
I KNEW IT  I posted her saying that after being killed by three different people using TSE weapons while I was in pacifist mode and it exsploded with toxic replays calling me a lair.
---
Some people did replay with nice comments but it was too much in the end and I had to delete it.
---
Thank you for testing it out and letting us know.
---
This every last exploiter needs to lose their accounts.
---
If this thing is on the production servers Bethesda really has a weird way of doing things.
---
I found a newbies camp. It only had 2 stash boxes and a sleeping bag and a cooking station inside, with a few walls and a turret on the roof. How do I get this persons attention to give them some stuff? I know I'll give the wall a hit with a sledgehammer. That will be like ringing the doorbell right? So I drop a bunch of stuff in a bag, some chems, stimpacks, water, etc. hit the wall. Nothing. I wait. Maybe I need to destroy something to get their attention. Take out shotgun and destroy a wall. Nothing. I wait and someone around my level maybe higher but doesn't make a difference shows up to kill me. Oh well maybe they get the little bag I left and feel bad for killing me. The end.
---
Fake until you give real proof.  So many scam posts and comments tonight.  Anyone can write e fake email, with no pictures, no videos, no account names.
---
I think it has to be the same type of bobblehead. 
---
Same on Xbox One since I have the game...
---
Those people are dicks. Me and the group i play with all have various types of TSE weapons but when it comes to nuke farming we all switch to normal or non explosive tesla rifles so everyone has a chance to hit enemies. 
---
Every now and then there will be people outside our group who come up and try to use TSE weapons and we warn them in chat not to use them or emote to them trying to get them to stop.. if they dont we turn off pacifist.. 4-8 people with TSE weapons aiming at 1 dude hes gonna die regardless of him attacking us back or not. 
---
It's the fertilizer thing
---
That's a change included in the next update at the end of the month. They put it in this patches' notes by accident.
---
It's the fertilizer resource under resources.
---
I lost two items today, they randomly dropped from my inventory to the ground.  I was able to recover one of them by retracing my steps.  I was just about to post this.
---
None of my items are duped.  
---
so.... never? well, for me at least
---
Good god, I dont' even want to think about it. I still keep the Explosive Instigating &lt;something&gt; Single action revolver in my stash in the hopes that they one day fix the thing to be usable.
---
With the reload time it currently has it needs to do something like 2 times the damage it does now.
---
Under resources, called fertilizer producer.
---
It's one cow and a wheelbarrow.  Dunno why they call it differently in the plan.
---
I didn't know :(
---
Aaaahh thank you fine lads of the internet :D
---
Ammo mods are standard:
---
.45 is x+0.16 dmg and 0.08 for the dual version.
---
.38 is x-0.125 and -0.25 for the dual version.
---
&gt;It's a larger calibre round than the standar .38 round so I'm expecting a moderate upgrade in damage
---
Bigger bullet doesn't mean more damage. Kinetic energy is mass x speed x speed. Ping pong balls are bigger than marbles, but I'd rather get hit by one shot from a sling than by a smaller marble.
---
&gt;but it almost looks the same as the standard .38 receivers.
---
It does not, you just showed that having a dual .45 boosts the damage of a pistol as much as having a dual damage mod.
---
You’re not really supposed to have everything you could ever need on hand at all times. That’s part of the design. I have 6 sets of power armor, extra plans/recipes that I randomly clear out seeding Flatwoods church and then cosmetics that are rare and still have room for junk. I have a few situational weapons stashed and my order of Mystery stuff stashed and I always have around ~100 space left over in case I hit the jackpot on flux ingredients. 
---
You and what army?
---
Well the MIRV fatman is not a safe weapon (I blow myself up all the time) but there is a safe distance to shoot it.
---
How about don't hoard mods you aren't gonna use yourself? I agree though, mods should not be scrappable. Can't understand on what planet would you ever need to scrap ANY mod for that puny 2 Steel Scrap.
---
With everyone begging for it, I'm sure it will come back but for twice as much.  Look out $30 dollar skins here we come!
---
I take a workshop for the plans and walk away.  I never even set up any sort of farming stuff since they nerfed component farming.
---
If it comes under attack, I'll wait until it's over taken  and take it back from whatever took it.
---
If another player, however, is the one taking it, he can have it.  Thye aren't worth the effort to fight other people. 
---
Most of the servers I have been on in the last month or so, since the nerf, every single workshhop is open.  Nobody takes them anymore unless they are after something specific.
---
Outpost Alpha in the Cranberry Bog 
---
Third Floor of Fort Defiance. 
---
Watoga at the crashed Vertibird. (Rooftops tend toward T-45 and T-51).
---
Left Legs and Helms are the higher chance finds. Level 50 right legs tend to be a low chance spawn in the frame. 
---
Thank you for the reply! Can you make a screensot or in some way capture how it looks in your game?
---
You can apply mods without the flux etc. In case you didn't know.
---
Lol agreed.
---
So are laser rifles!
---
You've never heard of trading? I won't use mods for T-45, T-51b and T-60, but someone will. They just fixed scrapping Hardened Mass, so I understand why they didn't do with the mods, the problem is known for some time...
---
Well it has been confirmed that BGS will be the only ones hosting them. They also said that they needed a year to get them going. I think it'll either be exactly like fallout 4's built in limited modding system that I never bothered with, or it'll be Creation Club 2.0. that was kind of a worst case scenario prediction tho. 
---
Plus, even if it is the best case scenario, you'd probably still have to rent one of their servers or something like in EA's Battlefield games. 
---
Keep in mind, in my current fallout 4 save I have like a hundred and fifty mods installed. Like a third of those mods require the script extender and that just won't be a thing that will ever exist within 76. 
---
So in other words, even if 76 gets free mods, you'll still probably have to rent a server and the mods will probably be as limited as Fallout 4's in game mod system. That doesn't cut it for me. 
---
I run nuke zones with no PA or Hazmat. You are very mistaken. If you feel like abusing other bugs there's even a way to take no rads that involves dying in the nuke zone or fast traveling - I'm not sure which because I don't have to do it....
---
I understand you are disadvantaged by a bugfix. You are wholly incorrect about the need for a hazmat suit or PA if you insist on not wearing either of those options.
---
Yah it’s it’s there reward for there citizens arrest they totally deserve it
---
Increase reload and move speed but makes food and water go down faster
---
I don't understand how it'll help me or you didn't understand my problem...
---
Correction:
---
Not sure about Psychotats, but Grape Mentats recipe most certainly does exist, I've pick up two in my adventures, from events as I recall.
---
Exactly my point. Pve servers wouldn't affect workshops as much as the OP makes it seem like.
---
That reminds me I had just started a new character and build my first camp. Started working with my gun and armour when some random comes in and starts hitting me while on the work bench .
---
I laughed got out put my junk away while he/ she is still hitting me. Got my baseball bat out and beat the crap out of him/her.
---
Then took his/her junk, broke it down and stored it. He/she came back when I was out side trying to get revenge... My gun turrets made short work of that.
---
Sunnytop Station is a known SB hunting ground. 
---
They hunt that area quite a bit. They have since BETA. Nothing new there.
---
If you're playing on pc you can download a mod to stop your mods being auto scrapped. 
---
You get reduced accuracy with 2 shot weapons
---
That's what I was thinking. Maybe we will see some fake YT videos where a person is talking about how they got the hammer, even though they never even played the game before.
---
Fallout: Second Life
---
It helps because then you apply them to your items as soon as you get them and don't lose them.
---
Charging Barrels mod: Increased the Gatling Laser’s damage bonus from the Charging Barrels mod.
---
Literally copied and pasted that from the patch notes.
---
So not only do you bother to reply to a month old comment, but you also say I'm wrong? Seriously?! The mod was garbage in fallout 4, and it's not like the update fixed a bug regarding the mod, they simply buffed the damage. They buffed the damage, and below you responded to someone else at the same time, saying basically the same thing. Since the mod was trash before, I wasn't wrong, and if they buffed it, that means it's not complete trash anymore. Overall, the gatling laser is still underpowered, along with the minigun as well. Were you drunk writing these comments...?
---
I’m just reporting everyone who keeps copy pasting these fake emails and screenshots 
---
It look exactly the same as your screenshots but for the one which have "2 different color sides", as far as I remember, only saw it in the mire.
---
Does the perk for receiving more scrap parts from breaking down weapons give you the chance to get screws?
---
If you like abusing bugs there's one that lets you walk around with no PA at all. I'm sure you can find out how to do it - I don't need it.
---
One alternative for you is RadShield. Don't want to nerf your mutations? Diluted Rad-X. Run out too fast? Get BioCommMesh. Have friends? Rad Sponge and Ghoulish.
---
Even with 2300 rad resist _outside of a Hazmat Suit or PA_ you still take 8-14 rads which is easily chewed through by Rad Sponge.
---
I only wear PA in the nuke zone for two reasons:
---
- Stabilized for Big Guns
---
- Bloodied is easier to manage
---
Same I actually don’t have anymore food on my character so I need to go out and find a good place to get food 
---
I've painted mine, the frames don't get any other identification except the little Atomic Shop icon for those paint jobs. Figured this would at least be an easy way to separate my Ultracite and excavator from the rest. The icon disappears when you put them in your stash, tho, and will only reappear when you put them in your inventory, place them on the ground, and collect them again. So, basically useless unless you want to carry all your PA all the time. I hate having to sort through half a dozen chassis to find the right one before going into a nuke zone. 
---
First off, there really isn't any proof of this glitch but if you really are worried, just don't accept trades from random people and you'll be fine.
---
Whole armies and nations at a standstill, waiting for one damn courrier to make up his / her goddamn mind. Love it
---
You can fight in nuke zones without PA.
---
You just haven't sorted out how yet. We'll welcome you when you do.
---
The thing is you don’t have to accept trading, they can just double click and then view your stuff....not sure if they just steal things or if they just view it
---
I'd say down a drink for a disconnect, a shot for everytime a legendary enemy doesn't drop legendary loot, and just regular sipping because who waits for some game to tell them to drink anyway?
---
Lol seriously though, a 76 drinking game could be pretty fun.
---
   
---
the game becomes boring at the end when all you have to do is gather materials, make bullets, collect legendaries, repeat for 30 days I'm the same 
---
and what I explore every day, I take out the daily tapas. the daily missions are so stupid 
---
Lever action only has a minimum level I’m pretty sure. You can find it anytime past that level with no cap 
---
Oh, so you never had 640 corn in your C.A.M.P. inventory because the game is a mess? :D
---
I dont understand how y'all cant stay in a server 
---
Yeah, thanks for getting a game that's been out for 2 months to an almost playable state. Keep up the good work.
---
Bullshit. A 200% condition MIGHT last you one scorchbeast.
---
Xbox one here. Thanks for the lookout yo. 
---
God damn yes
---
its not real, dont worry about it; plus in the update coming to console next week the bug where you can see someones inventory before they accept the trade will be fixed (they can only see your inventory not take things for 0 caps)
---
I really hope they do not.  Those guns are meant to be powerful and rare.  The problem is the duper's.  As someone who has not gotten one, that would punish me when I finally get one.
---
This gets fixed in the patch PC just received
---
* **Trade**: Fixed an issue where players could view another player’s inventory before they can respond to a trade invite.
---
* **Trade**: We no longer let trades occur before the requested player has consented to trade.

The game becomes boring when you are a mindless drone who just farms and grinds
---
The idea of mods is that you don't craft them (therefore you don't need any mats for it) and can apply it to your weapon/armor. But it's not useful, when you got valuable mods for trading, which you can't apply to your items.
---
I have a deathclaw in my camp as well. The workaround I have was to pacify him and log out while he’s still pacified. This will lock him forever in pacified mode (white name), so the good thing is that he wouldn’t aggro on other players anymore. But the bad thing is that he doesn’t aggro on anything at all now. I had a radrat bullying him to almost half health, and all he did was stand there doing nothing =/ 
---
A way to work around that issue is to attach the mod to the part and store chassis in your stash. Just trade the part, rather than the mod. If you have a rare paint on it's only a bonus when it comes to trading
---
Well still, like I said, there's no real proof of this existing, multiple people have done multiple tests and couldn't replicate this 'stealing glitch'.
---
If I had to guess how this rumor started. While someone was at the vendor they accidentally sold their shit without knowing because the menus can be a glitchy fuck fest sometimes. I would know, sold my underarmor like that and only realized my fuck up too little too late. And somebody just happened to be there wanting to trade so they thought that player stole their shit.
---
No one was thanking Bethesda. We were thanking the devs who keep working on it and the people at Bethesda who go through reddit and helps the devs figure out what the players want fixed
---
You do know punctuation exists, right.
---
Also, **FUCK EMOJIS**
---
But yeah, I'm the sane. I never run out of stash limit after the increase to 600. Only time I did was when I'd forgotten to scrap the 10 assault rifles I had been hoarding for mods.
---
I might try this next time I move camp. I love building extravagant stuff and I have a short attention span. Right now I'm on the flattest spot in the world (this one bit of the Whitespring golf course), which I adore. And there's no goddamn weeds poking through my floor... and you can actually find the carrots in my perfect tidy garden.
---
Thank you for offering options other than let me place all my junk in my house! 
---
Great ideas!
---
You can not look in someone elses stash. Don’t know where you‘ve seen these adhesives. Brown bag?
---
Keyboards layout usually is based on your language most used letters the middle row is usually the most used row so you have an efficient resting point while your typing
---
Yeah my bad I saw the other post after mine, doh.
---
Please, for goodness sake, drop a scrap item first. If it drops then you can transfer your mods into the bag. I had exactly the same mentality as you and knew about the scrapping of mods from stash, dropped my x01 jetpack that took me 6 days of server hopping and it glitched into the floor, never to be seen again. I hunted round to see if there were any other bags dropped that it could of went into but nothing. Learn from other people's mistakes my friend :)
---
Two Shot weapons have always had reduced accuracy.
---
The smell ... 
---
I had about 200 radaway and spent and 5 minutes giving tons of it to some friends.
---
Unfortunately the rewards are capped at level 35 so you won’t get top level legendaries there.
---
&gt;I know it's risky (server disconnection), but will it prevent the game from scrapping them?
---
Honestly after the patch you're more likely to disconnect and lose them than scrap them on accident, I wouldn't do that.
---
Why are you holding onto mods you're not using anyways?
---
On the other hand, I must have gone through it 4 or 5 times, sometimes logging as much as 240 hours half-way through my playthrough, and pretty much always siding with myself
---
Alright, but did you take any of the steps I suggested?
---
First I'm hearing of it but thanks for the info.
---
I am with you on this topic. But the crappy game economy, the useless PvP system and the partly ruined endgame PvE are Bethesdas fault... and their fault alone. I still can't believe a AAA company made those idiotic mistakes.
---
And especially the monster mash, I don’t see many people talking about it. That and the super mutant fev place always drop the best stuff for me.
---
Nice catch!  Guess they forgot to mention this in the patch notes.  Wonder what else got left out?  Maybe they brought back the [missing radio tracks](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/284066/tumbling-tumbleweeds-removed-from-the-radio-since-the-last-patch) as well?
---
76 is the AK47 of games
---
Yup. You can be placed in 'bad sport' matchmaking. You also get a Dunce cap that cannot be removed until you leave 'bad sport'. 
---
Exactly.  I always have pacifist mode on due to tse and its power and I'm really not a pvp person.  If people are being one shot while pacifist is on then it's way more then duping.  It sounds like a flaw in the design of pacifist mode.  I'm not defending duping or cheating but I feel like there should never be forced pvp and with an option to stop pvp not working, well we have more issues then just duping and cheating going on here.
---
Please. A method for us to see what plans we know before we become walking vendors ourselves from buying so many duplicates (I've already started). Makes me feel like a khajit telemarketer tracking people down to see me wares....if they have the coin...
---
Okay buddy. I don't really care what some random person on the internet thinks. 
---
Damn I need to learn stash management from you ! Again I'm comparing with stash management from fallout 4 (basically inexistent) where I could keep and experiment everything but I guess Fallout 76 is a different experience and that stash management is implied by the survival aspect of the game
---
If you thought of this one (https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/208) it doesn't work for crafting...
---
I built my camp on a pond that has Beehives, so I can get honey.
---

---
Same here, though I got the Excavator pretty early on thanks to friends who gave me a tonne of materials. They've stopped playing since, so when I decided to upgrade my armour at level 50 I had to do it all myself, and finding the screws and springs was a damn nightmare! Thanks to doing it though I'm pretty clued up on the value of different junk items now.
---
The one thing that was a nightmare was after setting up endless workshops to mine black titanium I realised I could've saved a tonne of time just killing mole miners :|
---
According to OP this is an old screenshot pre-patch. 
---
&gt;which thanks to today's patch fixing, they're not going to be able to recover.
---
Uh, no?  I guess I was assuming you would be a heavy build also, but not lying.
---
Thank you, I'm glad to finally beat the true endgame.
---
Maybe it's just me but I keep loosing server connection more than ever after patch. Loading times appear to be shorter though.
---
Regarding new things? Name of my character on map instead of login name, please :/
---
If by any chance there would be 2ppl with same name trying to play on one map, game should not allow one of them to join that server.
---
Good for the first 100 hours(depending on your play style) a bit grindy and boring if you don't have any friends playing after that.
---
Dude, check both sides. Positive and negative revs. Check streams, Oxhorn channel on youtube for example, and make up your own mind.
---
I'm going to have friends playing, think I'd be able to enjoy this game for a while?
---
Don't post their names - report them to Bethesda with this screenshot attached - they will get banned.
---
It's not that hard to do while farming whitesprings. 2 days ago i did a flora run since i had enough other items to make 22 stable flux. With super duper on i ended up getting like 32-34 stable from just 1 run at whitesprings. I played some more and was able to get enough to craft another 10 before the servers died from the meat piles. I could do 2-3 runs at whitesprings and have enough to craft 100 serums.
---
Usually crafting is less than a minute, I'll risk dropping it if I'll be 100% sure that it prevents them to be scrapped. As for trading, I offering them few times a day, looks like they're not desired.
---
I hope you reported all of them and sent this screenshot with the report...
---
I'm just asking for reddits opinion... this isnt gonna 100% decide my final decision
---
Not much for exploiting. As far as ghoulish and rad sponge go, I have experimented with them and found them pretty garbage as they don't do much, if anything, against environmental rads, only rad attacks. Im surprised to hear that you take so much rad damage id you have 2300 resist. The suit only offers 1000. Then some other coding must lay behind the suit. 
---
Didnt know about diluted rad-x. Will try with rhis.
---
It was released unfinished, but they're making good progress. There's a lot of good game in there, and a big beautiful world to explore. If you enjoyed Fallout 4 but wished you could share the experience with friends, then you'll probably really get a lot of enjoyment out of Fallout 76. Even if you don't have friends that you normally play with, it really isn't that hard to find friends to play with in the game.
---
Now just if they were worth using once you get a explosive affix weapon.
---
Not sure, I just find by the time I've evenplaced the collectors I've wasted my time. Might try blueprinting. 
---
Since you only get 50 points to spend, and the max is 15 for SPECIAL, it’s not going to take 100 levels to respect the character. Are best you what? Need to move around 10-20 points? 
---
They gotta fix the legendary armor effects and two shot explosive guns first.
---
You should all make them point to a portaloo with the door opened, and when people sit inside and lock the door they become trapped XD
---
Seeing at the T45/T51b/T60 mods and plans aren't as rare as X0-1 I can believe it. I server hopped for 2 hours and got all the mods I wanted for my T-51b Nuka Cola set, including a jet pack.
---
There was a conversation? Do you have a link? ;)
---
Well, it's some idea, but the most mods I store for trading are PA ones, which weight many times less than PA part they're applied to. Not to mention cost of crafting and fact, I don't have 40 INT to craft really durable parts...
---
Not much for exploits, but clearly a broken hazmat suit offering full protection..... Was probably unintended and exploitable.... Those ethics are problematic together.
---
Ghoulish and Rad Sponge absolutely work, so I don't know how you could have messed that sample up. I can cure a teammate of all rads by just drinking dirty water - in the nuke zone they're even more effective.
---
The hazmat suit and PA definitely has some hidden flag and/or multiplier. With that, you'll need to find a way to _mitigate_ rads - or exploit a bug  (in a broken hazmat suit or otherwise) to avoid rads entirely.
---
I enjoyed about 40hours of it. thats about it though and i prolly would have had similar fun in other games. 
---
I enjoyed about 40hours of it. thats about it though and i prolly would have had similar fun in other games. But I played with a friend the whole 40h
---
Fallout 76 is not a successor to Fallout 4. It's multiplayer loot and shoot spinoff. If you enjoy that kind of thing and can overlook some bugs and mechanical shortcomings, I'd say it's worth the 10€.
---
I wear a combat helmet with a gas mask it looks very similar to the marine helmet
---
Nothing a splash of Chanel 5 won’t cure 😊
---
Thanks for the advice.
---
Praise be!
---
So first drop some scraps and then add to that bag mod i want to save, right?
---
&gt;Which is true, yes quad / double weapons consume 4x / 2x the amount of ammo than the base gun does.
---
No they consume one shell per trigger pull.
---
&gt; The animation does not reflect the amount of ammo reloaded, 
---
That is exactly how much it does.
---
People been calling for golf course camps to be obliterated in sight, but in reality it's only the turret camps near the club that need to be leveled. The helpful camps need to be treated the opposite. Respected with gifts left behind imho
---
Except it reloads 5 every time even if it only needs 1 shell
---
wat? ESO is made by Zeni max.  
---
Fallout is made by beth.
---
I've been crashing a lot lately as well.  Sadly, it's exhibiting the same behavior that all previous Bethesda games have; basically the game crashes more often the longer you play it (with the same character, but that probably doesn't matter here).  I want to place blame on the servers not being able to track everything, but it doesn't really explain the client crashes unless the client can't handle all the info being thrown at it either.  Honestly, I'd rather not pretend to understand their coding and would rather not know what it looked like.
---
I'll hold my happiness until my stash is doubled.
---
Do you have any idea how much stuff I've scrapped or dropped?? I didn't bother selling obviously.
---
I definitely reset the whole thing several times and tried starting with the gate.  It was giving me some nonstop BS about not having ground to place on and no components to lock to, even though it was as flat and barren of a ground as you can find in Fo76.  I mean, it was remarkably flat, which is why I built on that site.  I even tried fast traveling and relogging to clear the previous plants I had set up there (sometimes moving a crop keeps the old plant location as used space) with no luck.
---
Maybe not enough people care about fencing in a garden and this particular broken bit has flown under the radar.  I'm not going to lose sleep about not having a fence around a tato patch.  I have a missile turret and spotlight watching them, so if one gets destroyed it's not a big deal.
---
But then you run the risk of losing players that have legitimately got tse weapons. I'm not spending another 300 hours grinding in the hopes I'll get another, I'll just move on to a different he and I'm sure many others would too. The best solution is to release the 4 and 5 * weapons to make them effectively worthless
---
Pics for comparison, i was off a bit lol

That's right, then you should be good.
---
I have a similar setup as you, and I had a lighting glitch after the update, but it wasn't as bad as in your screenshot. It was as if shadow distance was at a "very low" setting.
---
I could definetly see this being a thing, similar to the way Pokémon games work. Not the in game seed part for the Pokémon side of things, that would apply more to player in game I.d. Ie if you had an in game id ending in an even number you would find a specific Pokémon during a specific time frame. Munchlax had to be the most commonly know rng effected by this, even number there were four specific trees he would stand by odd numbers it was four others. 
---
Music to my ears!!
---
 "this was the first time I noticed a 1 hour blanket mutation suppression from the new serum"
---
It's a 1 hour suppression of the NEGATIVE effects of the mutation (from the serum), not suppression of all mutation effects.  
---
A friend of mine had his Marsupial mutation turn into herbivore today. Luckily he'd found the plans for marsupial on a SBQ the other day, so he just cured it and re-did marsupial.
---
What's your total defense outside of power armor? Mines over 500 balistic/energy. 
---
The trade stealing wasn't real, right? It was only a glitch that allowed people to look in your inventory?
---
Thank you. I think trying to work around the limitations of an online game and using already established assets might be something Bethesda could actually do. 
---
There's no way for people to clutter up camps without adding to server stresses, so I thought these may be good work arounds.
---
For disagreeing with you? lol
---
I picked up a bag of duped Aids (No pun intended) 
---
Will I be banned?
---
I posted the image of the email.
---
Whats your total balistic/energy defense outside of power armor? Mine over 500/500
---
PWM isn’t useless, cloth is one of my most needed resources.
---
ACKTUALLY it was never a problem and you suck for wanting to store excess supplies! /s
---
Ok, most ppl here like the game and support it, however everyone agrees that there are several serious issues that shouldnt be there to begin with. 
---
If you're ok with buying a game that is a work in progress, and you like the fallout universe, you will like this one.
---
Just take your time with it, dont rush. Avoid farming or grind until you're level 60 or so.
---
Explore and milk as much as you can. Eventually you'll run into bugs and glitches. Some are workable, some are really annoying. Hopefully they will solve them.
---
Around level 80 you'll run out if things to do. 
---
Thats when pvp, events, treasure maps, base building and farming will become your main activities and the game becomes dull. Hopefully, new content will be released soon. 
---
All melee. I take like 0 damage from the ghouls at whitesprings
---
I dont know your platform but I play on xbox. Occasionally when I check my stats only a few of my mutations show up. I freaked out the first time but they were all there and working, just not displaying. Occasionally they come back on the stats page on their own or if I relog in. 
---
Skeleton, irornclad and foreprooof all maxed with 1 in sunkissed is my endurance special for 12 poidnts
---
I thought you could name items in FO4, why wouldn’t you in Fallout 76 
---
Holy jeez. This sounds good. Thanks for your input.
---
According to the mod description "Prevents the user from accidentally scrapping mods while crafting or repairing gear if the mod is being used as a crafting component.". Maybe the last patch broke it. 
---
No just had 3 point in fireproof and decided to no spend more perks to try 1 and 2
---
Yes. Wouldn't affect me at all. But it would suck for those who legitimately saved and bought something, even if it might be better in the long run.
---
Still wouldn't catch everything, since I'm sure I've read on here they were duping and selling plans and serums too.
---
Except for
---
&gt;	Crafting: Level 25 armor and above now requires ballistic fiber to craft.
---
This is the opposite of what we asked for. Rip high level armor. 
---
They're less accurate by nature BUT vats really really should reflect this 
---
Yes!!!!
---
Got a two shot double laser rifle, seems to break faster than a normal laser rifle lol.
---
If i find one i plan to use it on myself to see
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
Unless you can take on 2 scorchbeasts at once I'd recommend avoiding taking that place.
---
Getting that defense mission can make things quite a pain in the ass.
---
It's not bad, at all Honestly. I couldn't be bothered to put more than 50 hours into 4 but I've sank nearly 160 into this one and haven't touched the main story all that much. Yes it's a bit grundy but once you find your groove and some weapons you enjoy enough to where you don't feel the need to grind anymore exploring and just finding your own thing to do is fun. That being said they definetly need to add some dlc content soon. From what I understand they've patched the biggest exploits and that was the biggest downside of all. 
---
I'm doing melee and rifles, with max strength, armor penetration and damage reduction. My ski sword ignores 50% and does close to 200. I've got a couple of rifles that do in the 120's, along with the black powder rifle and dragon in the mid to high 200 range.  
---
Try relogging. I had the same thing happen to me, but I had the space back after I disconnected and came back.
---
I have a 3 star 2 shot with 33% vats accuracy and faster movement while aimed. It's my baby
---
Lolz I thought everyone runs varying unburdened 
---
Well, you can nuke those toy cars and it does nothing to them. 
---
come on, we all know everyone can build a high tech armor that makes you almost invincible with 50 clipboards, some duct tape, broken light bulbs and decades old desk fans
---
"They would have to re-tool the game in order to do that"
---
No, not really. The most polished aspect of Fallout76 on release day was the micro-transaction store. The perk card pack mechanic always felt like it was designed to be behind a paywall and the data-mined info about lootboxes (sorry Lunchboxes) having the "atom store" prefix added all point to a game that is already more than half way to being "Free to Play"  and indeed looks like it may have been the plan early in development. 
---
A few nerfs here, throw a few buffs behind a paywall there and bingo ... It's free to play ready made.
---
Good news is that with the new update, we'll need fewer components to repair our armor! Goodbye ballistic fiber farming!
---
If you take your time and don't rush through the game you'll likely have a lot of fun for awhile. If you race to the "end game" you'll be disappointed. 
---
They got a list and if they worked on one thing at a time there wouldn't be a Fallout 76. It a recomendation and a hope for the future. Not a must have it now post. 
---
A lot of the time  don't have time or patience to read the notes. I'm in a post apocalyptic world, and I'm picking up every magazine and note I can find. I don't have a TV and the radio keeps playing the same songs. I need those notes, like basket guys needs all the baskets.
---
Yeah you can. You just cant enter it.
---
It's been said a few times now. Maybe not for this patch, but for the last couple that fixed things. 
---
I disagree. That is all. 
---
Recharge all your fusion cores. The logout login recharge is gone.
---
Good. They're cheaters and hackers, so they should be banned. 
---
Played since BETA, it keeps getting better and better - so at least that's a thing that's happening.
---
Had two shot lever with better vats. Itstill missed at 95 percent shots constantly. Such sorrow 😭
---
Yeah, me too. The times I *do* get disconnected are so rare, I might as well not play this drinking game. Here's a better one instead:
---
Go to Watoga. Go to the crashed Vertlbird near the AMS Headquarters. Take a shot for everytime you server-hop and the Power Armor spawn there doesn't have Level 50 T-51 armor, Take 2 if the Power Armor Chassis is empty, Take 3 if not even the Chassis spawns, and down the bottle if T-51 armor *does* spawn but it's Level 30
---
Now that's you die of alcohol poisoning
---
&gt; Unless you can take on 2 scorchbeasts at once I'd recommend avoiding taking that place.
---
[I could, but it's more a case of staying sane.](http://i.imgur.com/GjbgU0z.gif) ;)
---
I play on PC.  I quit to desktop and reloaded the game just in case the new mutation was conflicting with previous ones, but herbivore was still gone.  It's pretty easy to tell just by looking at soup values and seeing the effect on the hunger bar.
---
I work in a hardware store irl, you’d be surprised.
---
Even better, let's just deliver any junk items you need directly into your inventory at the press of a button from camp.
---
I think till the stash limit is fixed, you seriously have to consider what mats to keep and ditch.
---
Nevertheless, bulk bulk bulk.
---
I have not touched Andromeda but I actually enjoyed ME3 multiplayer quite a lot. More than the SP campaign in fact and I really enjoyed ME1+2.   
---
Maybe something is bugged with mutations in general then. Because I've had mine for a while now and only the past two weeks or so have I had the phantom disappearance issue. 
---
Hope you can figure it out
---
I have 3 legit explosive weapons, 1 of that is TSE, all within maybe 3 weeks of casual farming (and I work and have hobbies mind you).
---
Thank you, one more location to farm for those who need it ;)
---
I want those vault dweller bodies on spikes so that people wil skip my camp.
---
The only way you have one let alone two different TSEs is through cheating
---
I can't imagine them doing anything of the sort like wiping inventories or removing items unless they had a VERY cut and dry case.
---
It wouldn't be fair to people caught in the crossfire.
---
They'll fix the exploits and that will be that.
---
I've found the best area to gather firecaps is in the area around Slocum Joe's, just north of the Overseer's camp. 
---
There are also a few found in the basement of the Vault-Tec Agricultural Research Center (though for some reason, I've found that Green Thumb perk doesn't seem to work with these ones?)
---
Right.  Or looted a Super Mutant with 20 frag grenades on them that don't appear when you pick them up.
---
Maybe if I had any inkling that Bethesda gives one fuck.
---
Thank for help, hopefully Bethesda fix this in the next patch...
---
Do you actually go back and read them though? I never have. 
---
Hopewell Cave (or something like that) spawns 3 start Deathclaw time to time. 
---
Also just an Fyi, you don’t have to remove starched genes to drink the serum and gain the mutation.
---
lol complaining that the exploiters secondary accounts got banned too... 
---
"well yeah i know i cheated on irarsehole69  but on imdouche420 i never duped thats not fair"
---
Isn’t twitch a tool used to make YouTube vids? Lolz
---
On the contrary, i went from playing hard sniper to  level 25, realized there was no way to mitigate rifle weight, so i built more towards shotguns, then i grabbed a standard gatling at level 40 and started killing things in literally 5-6 shots of 5mm, which crafts in stacks of 100 (140-180 with ammosmith) used those last 10 levels to get bear arms. Now i walk around with 4 flavors of gatling gun, a mutants lmg to burn .308 ammo, the pyrolyzer for running a team medic, daisycutter and bunker buster and a 3 star bloodied gatling plasma. My weight usually hovers around 220, with deep pocketed gear and strong back my carry is at 340 no power armor. 370 with grilled radstag and psychobuff. 
---
Bit of a stupid thing 2 do though. Banning dupers has been happening all December. 
---
I have gotten good utility/trading gear though. Armor is one thing but several pieces of gear that increase sneaking is a whole other level of power
---
I say this because I was wrong about it being hard to hit a flying SB with it.  I went out to an army base (without repairing the AA missiles obviously) with a new weapon and checked condition after.  It was no where near as low as when I tried it last.
---
All heavy gunner perks, stabilized, bloidy mess, gunsmith, and it was actually a leg +30% vs scorched.  Pretty sure I didn't even pop psycho.
---
I guess the worst thing they could do would be to see if you have loads of junk and see if it was worth a bounty for killing you and stealing it all
---
Thats highly debatable. I agree that duping for example is a bad practice and players should be warned and punished bc they're affecting other players.
---
However, its the players fault that the game allows these exploits? Its not exactly a crime is it?
---
Bethesda released a game with serious issues, gamers exploited these issues, and now Bethesda is banning them?
---
Wouldnt be fairer just to track and eliminate duped items? Or warn the players that duped items should be scrapped or they would be punished?
---
These people actually brought attention to a problem existing in the game.
---
Banning people for exploiting a broken mechanic of your game is not a solution, is alienating a great chunk of your fan base.
---
I’ve read several times that they can’t take anything, but they can see what you have and what your gear is to know if they can goat you into pvp, easily kill you and take your junk.
---
Have you expirienced anyhthing similar to my screenshots? It is better can be seen in mire region, this glitch realy likes this zone. 
---
I like it, but I dont think Bethesda would agree. You could easily exploit it, and or dupe to farm and sell.
---
Why does someone hunting a bounty have total advantage and then just disappears from the map afterwards? They are going out of their way to initiate pvp, yet they are completely invulnerable due to slap mechanics and then invisible due to some other genius pvp mechanic. Look at Red Dead Online pvp. That's fun. This isn't fun. This is lame. No wonder people exploit the pvp flagging mechanics and prey on noobs and idiots to steal their junk and caps, since even consensual pvp is so awkward and near impossible.
---
I worked on many pirate servers mmo as a dev.
---
(Rf online, lineage 2, ultima, mu etc..)
---
Except for RF online they never had inventory control/game master tool coded.
---
Basically the only ones that are interested in messing with player inventories/giving game masters god’s powers are private servers.
---
Companies don’t give a F.
---
In most of hacked game servers, I Had to code my own, basically database parsers.
---
Considering the amount of data I have no idea what they are using.
---
Most of the time it works like this: 
---
you login, server parse Sql DB to check your stats/inventory. Then that data is injected in server’s Ram while you are playing and modifications are made in Ram. When you logout, the new data is written in SQL, or remains in RAM until a stored procedure is activated.
---
Just to brag, gimme access and I code a tool for you Bethesda... do not say it can’t be made..
---
And a procedure to delete all the dupes is...easy.
---
&gt; light survival game. Survival games. Inventory management is a thing.
---
If you want to appeal to the genre, guess what: light survival crafting games almost ALWAYS have near-infinite *player home* storage. Minecraft, Ark, 7 Days to Die, etc.
---
Those games would be a nightmare if you could only set down one or two storage containers at your base. There is nothing wrong with *personal* storage but a tiny limit to player home storage really messes with some people's enjoyment. Some people just dont have fun deleting things they know they might need later.

Couldn’t find pink on this list? 
---
No, though in the mire at one point it looked like my shadow distance was halved.
---
Its because you do reduced damage until both parties engage in PVP. 
---
It's so griefers cant harrass people not wanting to  PVP or low level players.
---
I think you get the recipe when you complete the "Ounce of Prevention" quest in the main questline.
---
Yes. i have no GPU OC programms running and tried resetting control panel to defaults. Nothing changed.
---
Yeah everyone who use the carry weight glitch needs to get banned as well
---
The cap is 40 and 3 legendaries. I've never seen more than 3 and i do it many times every day.
---
well i have yet to run into a graphical glitch like that, or like any yet. I have a good setup. as someone mentioned somewhere in the comments, if ur drivers are not working right, thats when u get those colours.  If it was server side issue, everyone would be getting those same graphic glitches, not just you. If i were you i would look up a guide of how to optimize ur PC and to do that, CPU/GPU wise and see if u can correct that. maybe you tinkered with the 3D settings for some game and derped those around.
---
I’m having a lot of fun. I paid full price and given that I have now spent more than 200 hours playing it has been more than worth it for me.
---
Why didn't you just try and buy one? Surely you gathered enough caps during your attempts 
---
If you read the TOS its likely that they spell out that using cheats and exploits can get you banned.  Not many people read those anymore, but it's almost certainly there.
---
Civil asset forfeiture irl cops do it all the time. XD
---
read the Notes in "Features"...
---
What’s an appropriate amount of TSE on 1 specific toon? 1, 100, 1000?
---
Maybe capping TSE amounts is the only way.
---
I know right ..but I have a actuall pink bat now ..and pink shows up in the mod list but it's not unlocked yet? Is is super rare then I'm guessing ? 
---
Is this to challenge the commies terracotta army?
---
Let 👏 me 👏 be 👏 ~~MadMax~~ 👏 a 👏 raider
---
I just have to say this but after uploading I should have made the title. Preparing for the future. 
---
Found a single shot explosive shotgun, 2 shot Tesla rifle, TSE Gatling gun, 2 shot laser and a single shot explosive laser, level 135.
---
Good they are getting what they deserve
---
Or those people that don't kill the scorchbeast and leave it to terrorize Watoga...
---
Is there a way to have a filter to not see posts like this anymore? I swear it’s like 50 per day smh.
---
Look at my post history, I did try with no dice.
---
No problem, glad to help!
---
Yes he does! Having played a ton of ESO I’m now firmly of the belief that Molag Bal is a complete asshole and that all his earthly followers should be hunted down and exterminated. 
---
Indeed, this shit is super annoying. Is there a way to have a filter to not see posts like this anymore? I swear it’s like 50 per day smh.
---
Ok, reduced accuracy.  But how much?   I miss a LOT, would be nice if the percentage shown was correct not just apparently an arbitrary number 
---
Yeah, those things don't exactly hang on trees, and the plans seem to be as rare as the handmade ones. I had to buy (with caps) both.
---
I would also like the opportunity to avail myself of your services. 
---
What are the crafting requirements, so I don’t waste anybody’s time by not having the requirements before ‘booking an appointment’ (lol)
---
ToS. End of story. No debate. It's not a great chunk of the player base, it's a tiny fraction of those who play that were cheating.
---
What does that even mean? Lol
---
Yeah sometimes I will read one, or replay an old holotape. There was actually a bug at one time when holotapes wouldn't automatically play when picked up so I probably have a few I haven't heard too. I think it's cool because when you play like I do, and skip a lot of stuff, like reading all those entries in computer terminals, and don't finish a lot of quests, there's always stuff to do. I have a new character and I want to read a lot more and pay more attention with her. It would also be nice to get some more context for lot of the ones I quickly picked up without reading.
---
Well, they did. Start getting used to it.
---
Bog town is pretty good.
---
Whitespring and its limitless supply of trash 1 star are a no go for a long time,if you want quality.  If you want fast caps tho...
---
“I wouldn’t have robbed your house if you just locked the door, this is all your fault. I’m innocent. I was just trying to bring attention to how you should lock your door!”
---
Or feral ghouls that are covered in a small amount of vegetation. I don't understand why some ferals look so clean.
---
I was more worried about it being digital though ?
---
I would bet some of these dupers/cheaters would be gone if Bethesda would give them a  refund. Two wrongs may not make a right but it does poke a finger in Bethesda's eye.
---
Maybe instead of blaming the dupers for exploiting a broken game that should't have been released yet, blame Bethesda for being stupid and greedy.
---
After they said they won't refund a digital download, I admit my outlook and play style changed from having fun to ruining fun. My actions are a consequence to Bethesda's actions not the cause.
---
Will do. But what do you think of Eric moving away? What about shotzee the dachshund? Can you believe Eric would hit him with that buddah statue?
---
Even though he's wanted?
---
They can see your inventory with this glitch but they can't take anything. It's fixed in the most recent patch. 
---
All these caps ruin the game - stash, special, caps. The game would be better without the limits
---
Nice...i think i chose my perks wrong
---
I had an advantage until I shot him. Even though I had the element of surprise he still one-shot me. So not sure what you're on about.
---
What it means is I’ve had a bone to pick with you cultist since a couple of you came by causin a fuss round my house hear?
---
I just bought it because I'm at level 82 and I don't want to create an alt.
---
I've gotten in the practice of only picking up chems that I use and aid items that I really need after seeing I was hoarding all kinds of chems for no reason and had crazy amount of rad-x/radaway. 
---
Sticking with a set number and selling any extras I do happen to end up with has been helping quite a bit. 
---
It's happened twice now.
---
Accidentally scrapped my favorite heavy weapon. First it was a minigun, this time it was my 50 caliber.
---
Thankfully I know where to go to find another one, but I couldn't support this suggestion any more than I do already.
---
If it's a favorited item, scrapping shouldn't be available.
---
Ow!  My ears!
---
180 hours but it’s not good? Your opinion is invalid 
---
they are fixing the fusion core recharge on server swap ... another shit to farm for now :(
---
The problem is the word exploiting, if someone accidentally duped a item, that's the game fault, if the same person actively tries to replicate said "accident" for their personal advantage then it is punishable (and should).
---
assassin / sentinel full set  +  stimpack spamming.
---
Got bored after like 70 hours. Nothing to do at end game 
---
He may have had an anti explosive build so he wasn't getting any explosive damage from your handmade
---
Absolutely! I brought this up somewhere else. Let me find ALL of the Teddy Bears and use them as ingredients to make a shelf to display them or a Teddy Bear covered bed.
---
Yay!!
---
Reinstalled graphics drivers?
---
I haven't gotten through all of season 6 yet but I thought he should've moved away sooner ahahaha.
---
Hell yes! Now take down all the sellers on Ebay.
---
same here had two just yesterday
---
Rad-X can suppress your mutations for a period of time. They will show again when it wears off.
---
Dense armor (+fireproof on PC after the newest patch) pretty much negates explosive damage. 
---
Or sentinel/assassins. 
---
Yeah, I definitely appreciate several of the changes. I hope stability is improved.
---
I hope they do something about group xp soon so people don't have to intentionally do a small amount of damage then run around asking, "Did you hit it? Did you hit it?" I'd much rather blow everything up on sight instead of dragging out every encounter concerned about whether or not everyone gets a piece of the pie.
---
Assassin's legendary armor -8% damage from players could get up to -40% (arms, legs, chest).
---
Auto-stim legendary effect and perk plus improved stimpack effect perks.  Super stimpack is twice as effective.
---
There are plenty of defensive perks that don't work in power armor too.
---
Just because you can do something doesn't mean you have to.  It says in the code of conduct that if you find an exploit you will report it and not take advantage of it.  If you see someone's car running that doesn't give you the right to jump in and go for a ride.
---
Getting defensive like that, as well as insults, just proves my point
---
Player A: “bad thing happened to me”
---
Player B: “I’ve never seen it, do you have any evidence?”
---
Player A: “you’re an asshole”
---
If that’s how you want to respond to a call of evidence about an issue that has not been confirmed, then you are going to do nothing but encourage more dismissal 
---
PC, 9700k, 1080Ti, 16GB, Win10
---
APocalypsse
---
\-Loading screen freezes, alt tab to desktop, can't maximise game again
---
\-Crash to desktop after \~10 minutes of gameplay
---
These have never happened before the latest patch.
---
Yeah you bit off more than you could chew apparently. Doesn't change the fact you had the advantage and he was just better than you I guess. If things are equal you would have won. Somehow he tipped the balance in his favor with perks, chems and armor.
---
No worries. There is a Fissure site between there and Pumpkin House. For some reason they love Sunnytop Station. I’ve been stuck inside before.
---
Are you actually saying that a weapon breaking after using a single piece of ammo is justified? If so, you are one of the dumbest people I have encountered on this sub. If not, my bad for the misunderstanding.
---
Always have pacifist mode on in nuke zones. People have been doing the "step in front of you while you're shooting things" for ages. 
---
If only there were an option to not do damage to other players! Bethesda we demand you add pacifist mode! 
---
If u don't have pacifist on in a nuke zone you're playing yourself bud 
---
Something like it from 357 to 260 something. Though that was the bloated ones. The regular ones should be less exp .. not sure by how much though as I've only played many 10 mins since the update, lol.
---
Updated, yes.
---
Understandable. I do get it. I've skipped a lot myself. I'm just curious if based on what people say lags the servers, if this is an issue. 24 people accessing inventories and stashes with hundreds of uniquely named notes. It has to have some impact on the game in some way. 
---
I also think a lot of the visual effects in nuke zones, and the ridiculous amount of spawns of robots and ghouls at white springs plays a huge part as well. I'd rather we had 3 or 4 stronger enemies than 8 and 9 less strong ones that drag performance down. 
---
I’ll double check when I log in tonight but I’m pretty sure.
---
If a person is wanted the agreement phase goes out the window. 
---
Gone worse for me too. Never before have game crashed mid session. Game was crashing on quitting, but not middle of playing. Yesterday I crashed 4 times and 4 queens I did yesterday- 2 had dc, 1 had crash, 1 I was able to complete. I have disconnected so little on queen before, I don't even remember disconnecting.
---
All the budget was restored from the wires that were blocking my space up. So I think so
---
Threw away 100 of various resources. Mostly because my stash box is almost full.
---
I'd have shot you.... Literally just assuming we both had pacifist on 
---
I have build my camp up in an transmission tower close to the Whitesprings station. Most people just walk past and don't even seem to spot my camp.
---
The change to the flame damage resistance card plus dense mod for armor completely nullifies explosive damage. You probably only did the base ballistic damage to him. If he had sentinel gear and wasn’t moving he would take even less damage.
---
The bouncer is a douchebag. Keeps mistaking me for a duper I guess. 
---
Oh yeah, I absolutely hate the iron sights on them. I can barely tolerate the reflex sights, which are really just a couple screws through a circle, but still better than an iron sight that isn’t very clear which are the indicators you need to use. 
---
But yeah, once you add an actual scope, they are pretty much identical to non pipe versions. My pipe bolt action doesn’t feel different than a hunting rifle, but don’t you dare take my scope away or I will cry tears of frustration. 
---
I do, in fact.  
---
My next step is to try rolling back to defaults to test whether some of that had been broken, but I didn't have time to test last night.
---
Let me stick my Christmas lights on everything, so I can spread that Christmas cheer.
---
TSEs just became pve weapons, bring out that Assassin gear boys and girls.
---
Stash and caps yes
---
 special no the whole point of the game is to shape your character to how you would like removing special by letting you max out everything wouldn't require you to make compromise in the later game and everyone would be stuplily op 
---
I mean not zero but level 3 let's you stand still getting hit for quite a long time before dying otherwise whitesprings would be a huge pain in the ass 
---
It would be cool if you had a little scrap book you could put all the notes in and put on a shelf or something. So it wouldn't be making the server call for them every time you skip through your inventory. Only when you open the scrapbook to put them in and read.
---
Looking to get full level 50 T-60, but every time I find a set with legs it's level 40. And I have a calibrated mod for at least one leg. Such BS.
---
I think we could keep them together, but just make PvP "zones".
---
I would like the idea of factions who have their own safe zones, and if a member from another faction carelessly wanders into the wrong area...dead!
---
Haha, yeah. I assumed you just meant it’s really effective. But thanks for clarifying.
---
&lt;3
---
&gt; Bigger bullet doesn't mean more damage. Kinetic energy is mass x speed x speed. Ping pong balls are bigger than marbles, but I'd rather get hit by one shot from a sling than by a much smaller marble. 
---
My god... I don't think I've seen a clearer example of a false equivalence on Reddit in a very long time.
---
Let's reframe your example. What would hurt relatively more - being hit with a small marble or a larger marble?
---
Not so easy to hand wave away, huh?
---
Look you can argue semantics all you want but in context of this situation (gun firing .38 vs same gun chambered for a heavier round), it's going to hit harder. Thing is it doesn't even hit harder in like half the cases. It's the same or, in the case of the .38 hardened receiver, it's lower.
---
If those numbers you gave are in-game ones, the one I'm questioning is the .45 examples you gave. Seems off given how little difference it makes. It's not even remotely in a similar class to equivalent weapons of the same calibre. As mentioned elsewhere, I'm not expecting the same performance with this mod over a stock .45 weapon but I'd expect to be a lot closer than what it currently is, which isn't better than a lot of .38 receivers.
---
Fuck that. A game that wants you to craft you should be able to do so whenever you want. 
---
**Wonderful feature of FO76: Crafting. Craft your camp,  mod your weapons and create power armour. But don’t forget, you can’t store store enough junk so you can’t always craft in demand. **
---
**Dont use all that look you gathered while playing - you’ll have to ditch it to save space. Instead take time from actually playing the game to find all the components you need. You’ll enjoy it better that way!**
---
**/s**
---
Jesus Christ. Yet more people defending a lacking feature and trying to shift blame to the player. 
---
Any other game which had features removed (compared to previous games) would be slated. 
---
Won't let me see the comment 😂
---
That’s an interesting idea, but I’m not sure I’d want to do that. I want him to be able to defend himself, especially against creatures that my turrets might miss.
---
Put on pasifism mode!
---
If everyone is OP, then no one is OP.
---
I'm really happy that they aren't just abandoning it.
---
Indeed. Going to have to keep an eye on this. I'm always making changes to my camp. 
---
I respect their opinions. But that won't change my love to fallout 76 !
---
I collect notes to read at my camp simply because of the fonts they use. I straight up can’t read half of the notes in this game because the text / background combo clashes half the time, or the writing is tiny. 
---
I want lore and little looks into the lives of these people and I can’t actually read what’s been written
---
Next week, Monday maybe?
---
Hopefully in time this game gets the No Man's Sky treatment. That would be great for both Bethesda and the community.
---
it happened to me too, i just went a bit further away so i could see him and i just sniped him down
---
surely you would like to a 1 v 1 camp battle at least once? 2 cool camps going at it while their owners are off somewhere.
---
That character was actually in power armor and you experienced a visual bug that makes their limbs look stretched out a bit while also not being in PA.
---
Not sure about attacking you without moving unless you mean they were shooting at you. You might have had an instance of not seeing their weapon too?
---
Aw poor little duper got punished for his/her exploits.
---
More common is relative. Right now, .38 ammo isn't that hard to come by for me. .45 ain't too hard either but still.
---
So wait, you want a source on the devs, the people not in charge, not being the ones that chose to release it early. As opposed to the management/owners, who are in charge, being the ones that made that decision? That's what you're asking for? It's just so lacking in common sense that I wanted to be sure. 
---
It was alright, I felt like it missed quite a bit but it is really hard to tell. I have a two shot fat man, but it didn't seem to work as well as my auto grenade launcher that does more damage the more you hit. Since I had to invest in the explosive carry weight perk just to carry the mini nukes it wasn't worthwhile in my opinion.
---
Try watoga station after scorchbeast queen dies.  People come back to the station and vendor stuff.   Got mine there but I'm pretty sure I was above level 40.
---
I suspect that Tormentor and Tank killer weren't operating properly 
---
I had a similar issue. The issue is the gate snaps a tad high. You can lower the price fence but to be honest I just skip the gate altogether now. Players can hop over fences but move can not.
---
So people are being banned from a game that they paid for because Bethesda has been sitting on their hands about patching a glitch. Makes no sense. This could’ve been stopped a long time ago but somehow it’s the players fault? Glitches have been a part of video games forever. I doubt many dupers are aware of the Mario Bros infinite lives glitch or the Konami code. That was cheating but no one got lambasted for it. I get that they weren’t mmos but pawning off the responsibility on consumers instead of fixing the glitch is negligent. No one is to blame for this except Bethesda. Have fun taking down a nuke zone or scorchbeast without a tse. Maybe if they made it easier to get one ppl wouldn’t be duping. I’d have been bored with the game a long time ago if I hadn’t bought a tse because at a higher level you can’t put up a fight against anything. Either buff weapons or nerd high level enemies and I’ll stop using a duped tse. Until then I’m going to enjoy it because it has made the game exponentially more fun. Bethesda is handling this shit terribly. 
---
Server hoped that around 7 times, not single time it spawned legendary monster. On 8th time game crashed, so I stopped trying.
---
Your post is long enough, you have no trouble typing.  I have trouble believing you are too proud to write an essay, but still able to blame you disability. Never let mine get in the way, and certainly never use it as an excuse, ever.
---
Sorry I didn't see your comment, the requirements are 5 violet and cobalt flux, 17 adhesive, 17 aluminum, 14 asbestos, and 9 nuclear material. I'm on right now if you want me to build it now.
---
It could be a combination of things, some builds can be incredibly tanky. I've been doing a low-health power armor build, and it was pretty much immortal in PvE. First item is Emergency Protocols on power armor chest, which is a flat 50% damage reduction. Then Dodgy, 30% reduction. Then Blocker (against melee only) for 45% damage reduction. Then Suppressor (doesn't work in PvP, allegedly), another 30% reduction. And that's on top of power armor DR. My health basically doesn't move at all in 98% of the PvE fights. And I do very respectable damage due to Bloodied weapons with Adrenal Reaction mutation, Nerd Rage, etc. 
---
If he were out of power armor, it could be similar, except Serendipity (45% chance to dodge 100% of the damage) replaces Emergency Protocols, and so on. 
---
There's also other useful prefixes, like Assassin's or Sentinel's.
---
For healing to full, it's Nuka Cola Quantum, especially with appropriate perk, which triples the effect. Normal Nuka Cola Quantum heals for 200HP, and 100AP. The perk triples that. So it heals from empty to full with single use. How do people have so much Nuka Quantum? Often duping, I saw people drop literally thousands Nuka Quantums. 
---
level 87 and plays without pacifist mode?!?!
---
Who needs to sneak when PA+stimpak lets you facetank anything?
---
I never understood why they had a weight to begin with.
---
If you want to scrap for mods wait till you get super duper it will help a lot. Did this myself later in the game since mats won't be a real issue and I'm not a fan of hunting for those last few plans.
---
My solution is to dump it all on a mule that I moved to my base. I never play on it, so the only time I use it is to put stuff in a container then switch back and forth. Its a hassle, but I have 5k carry weight on that baby
---
Can’t wait to see the new dupe glitches coming out 
---
You are missing the 100% extra explosive damage if you want to use the best shotguns:)
---
Flatwoods is also a good spot for Snaptail Reeds and Bloodleafs. They grow all along the stream next to town.
---
There is no pun there. 
---
Unlucky dude. I randomly found it just browsing the vendor and saw it. Back then there were no confirmations where you could buy the plan from.
---
I don’t see what your talking about legit criticism does not get down voted I never see that there are always ppl talking about bugs or discussing problems within the game or makeing suggestions to help the game those are the top post tbh 
---
Pile of bodies, pile of heads
---
I have 300 hours played and found some two-shots (5-6) some explosives (6-7) but nerver a TSE.  
---
i finally got it yesterday on my first time completing Power Up Poseidon. Im level 41. There was a group of five or so strangers working together so we were done in 20 minutes. Pretty great. 
---
Shhh... don't let r/fallout catch you praising Bethesda for anything...
---
Yeah, I tripped out hard first time I saw that. Doing first silo run with slender man was... interesting. I failed of course not realising he was in actuality in power armour and my power fist was not enough to beat the dungeon
---
While using the "White Knight" perk, the material cost is the same as pre-patch.
---
Oh I knew how unlucky I was, but on the other hand I acquired every other T-60 plan in the book and even the T-51b jet pack. So it wasn't all in vain.
---
well its vault tech so probably either direction will kill you 
---
That’s because you don’t have a tse. Way more fun with one. 
---
I'm sure that the guy had no weapon
---
76 had a much larger team and a lot more money, coming from a previously respected AAA studio.  It is easily the most disappointing game of 2018, if not all of the 2010s
---
Recently I read a guide about flux farming, now I have about 50 extra pounds of stable flux taking up space in my stash =(( I didn't quite thought this through. 
---
What point are you trying to make? Bethesda cleaning up 76 and banning cheaters that nobody likes?
---
Man this update keeps on giving! Well done bethesda!
---
I dont know what their beef is, its a great game. I can play for hours straight and still not feel like I’ve done enough
---
Mass Effect Andromeda easily takes that pie for me. 
---
Gears drop from deathclaws and a low level one always spawns on deathclaw island.  Wendigos drop screws and always spawn at the bottom of wendigo cave.  There is a ledge in the cave that if you can make it up to you can get to the end of the cave without fighting through all the mirelurks.
---
No its not. Youre playing wrong.
---
I carry 15 weapons, 3 sets of PA, countless aid items, and have 20 bulk junk of all kinds in stash. Things that dint bulk are kept at 200.
---
Use the tools they give you and you have all the space you need.
---
Did I mention to 30 fusion cores I lug around?
---
I havent been over encumbered (outside of when in PA) in weeks.
---
How you ask?
---
Use the perks. Stack armor that lowers weapon weight. Mutations. 
---
Think deeper, look harder.
---
Creepy bug indeed
---
Chems sell to vendors really well 4-6 caps per chem with hard bargain one
---
You never wanna keep weapons in your stash. What good are they there? Send them to an alt or carry them by reducing their weights with legendary armor/perks.
---
Screw that!
---
It takes no effort to not mess w/folks camps. These guys intentionally destroyed someone’s camp because they didn’t care. The risk to reward was minimal.
---
I wish the bounty system was better setup so that when asshats make a jerk play, the consequences are significant. 50% caps and mats, gone. Escalated to 75% each subsequent bounty.
---
Let’s see folks how quickly folks antagonize lowbies, when 1/2 or 3/4 of caps and mats go POOF.
---
No offense but banning players for the carry weight glitch is extremely extremely bad idea considering thier current optics 
---
I think both sides are right - I don't think we need infinite storage but some quality of life upgrades and a bit more space would be nice 
---
like a scrap function on the stash box that lets us auto recycle anything in the box 
---
but I could see a solid 1000 stash limit being big enough for a few builds worth of materials but small enough to keep the feel of a survival style game
---
T51b jetpack is actually more lucrative than T60 bro. You can sell crafting service for 1k caps (or more)  if they bring mats. 
---
You're not very bright, are you? You completely missed the point that size wasn't the only factor, other factors, like density, matter.
---
So does muzzle velocity, in case of fire arms ammunition is comes from pressure, so the amount of powder, the burn rate of said powder, the length of the barrel, etc...
---
&gt;Look you can argue semantics all you want but in context of this situation (gun firing .38 vs same gun chambered for a heavier round), it's going to hit harder.
---
It certainly won't, depends on the weapon and ammo, not just calibre.
---
&gt;If those numbers you gave are in-game ones, the one I'm questioning is the .45 examples you gave.
---
Check the game files yourself, it takes 30 seconds.
---
&gt;it's not even remotely in a similar class to equivalent weapons of the same calibre.
---
Comparing apples and oranges now, aren't ya? .45 does more dmg than .38 on the same weapon.
---
Andromeda is also terrible, but much more of a playable game and had substantially more effort put into its development.  The inclusion of NPCs and dialog options alone is evidence of that
---
1. The bashing is deserved. You have a game so over hyped, so over talked and promising so much and you end up with possibly the worst Besthesda title ever. I mean, from a technological, gameplay, origionality, pr, etc. So many issuse and lies.
---
2. You should alao just say you watched Angry Joes video. No need to try and overreach and make it sound as if everyone is hating it. (Although most are)
---
3. It's "Disappointing" not "worst" , im sorry but its ironic how you throw stuff around calling others idiots...
---
4. Atlas just like fo76 was a huge DISSAPOITNMENT. Fo76 was on a far larger scale coming ftom beloved Besthesda. The company that had built up so much good rep and put out quality and again back to 1., so much bullshit thrown around with a shit product on release. For fuck sakes, the transaction store worked better than the dam game.
---
5. No one was hyped for the Culling 2, therefore it was never a dissapointment.
---
Why do i waste my time. So simple to under the video. Dont let salt blind you. Besthesda fucked up and let its fan base down, it lied to them and didn't deliver on what it said it would. As someone who has been around since the first Fallout and early Besthesda games, they fucked up and i refuse to defend any of their bullshit.
---
They don't want you to keep items and swap builds around them. They want you to exp different characters for each build, so it's not gonna happen. 600 is very good to store anything related to a single build. The problem may be power armour different sets, fortunately I don't use it as a glass cannon sniper build. I just have 4/5 weapons, one armor set equipped and 500kg of junk, not ever worrying about crafting/repairs. The remaining 100kg are to store sellable legendaries
---
So they cheated and were banned? well I'm assuming they would then ban other people found cheating
---
Or identify them by the pieces on them, I’d be fine with it saying raider power armor or t51 power armor, if it’s mixed it could say incomplete or something 
---
You people seriously comparing cheating in a videogame with robbery?
---
Them hating Fallout 76 so much shouldn't affect how you feel about it. If it does, that's kind of a you problem. People are going to have their opinions. They may even have terrible logic and reasoning behind those opinions but it's their opinion all the same. Just move on and focus on those that are more fair with their assessment.
---
There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Fallout 76 should be on a worst top list for the year. Maybe not the worst as you've indicated and that has been the opinion of a number of Youtubers I've seen. However, it's pretty close to the top if not the first. To think otherwise is to delude yourself of the games plethora of flaws (and this is coming from someone who likes the game).
---
I understand where you are coming from but Atlas was the same. Fallout 76 was not luring people with false promises it just said this is what it is, Atlas was pure lies when people compared it to their trailer. I understand some disappointment but if I made platformers for a long time and made one game that was a okay puzzle game , people shouldn’t get mad when they were expecting another platformer  and it was clearly said what it was.
---
I do notice one really nice change "level 25 armour and above now requires ballistic fibre to craft"... Hmm, poop
---
Really? Huh good to know, thanks for telling me.
---
Show me on this doll where the TSE touched you.
---
OK fine, the queen isn't an end game mission, I forgot it is only optional.
---
I remember the plasma rifle and Enclave armor was great equipment for the end of Fallout 3.
---
Bbbbb but canvas bags and rum guys.
---
Like and subscribe for the love of god please!!!!!!!
---
Someone tested luck on drops and plans here on reddit. he got much more 3 star legendarys and plans with low luck. 
---
You only spend 20 mins with the inventory mini-game per play session? Wow, I have to up my game!
---
What do you mean "send them to an alt" ( sorry french here)?
---
Nah this dude is fucking weird, asking nurses what the weirdest thing they’ve ever found is after shaving a patient. 
---
Or asking for people’s stories masturbating at work. 
---
Your parents failed you, freak. 
---
I've had no change in DCs, once in the few hours I was playing last night.
---
I'm getting some hellacious new herky jerky lag though.  Still troubleshooting to make sure it's not one of my .ini tweaks, but it's bad.
---
Did you mean Armingo
---
Then you blue screen and lose them anyway.
---
Beat game 2018.
---
If your on xbox i can give you 140 screws
---
What is your GPU? I'm just almost certain it's your hardware since I've never seen this
---
&gt; Fallout 76 was not luring people with false promises it just said this is what it is,
---
They claimed it was 16x superior graphically to fallout 4, when in fact it is basically identical and straight up uses 90% of the same assets.  They said to expect bugs, not to expect the game crashing multiple times a day.  They didn't say there would be no story (lore is not a story, holotapes are lore,) but it should have been obvious from them saying no NPCs.  Fallout 76 is a barely functioning sandbox with practically no content, and the only draw to play is the grind and perk system.  The AI is easily the worst of any game I have played in my entire life for enemies as well
---
Lol what a whining lil bitch... Sounds like ricegum trying to get out of his bullshit. "I only did it a little bit, booo."
---
Lost my PA chassis when I dc'd yesterday, luckily nothing was in it. But today I dropped 1500 shotgun shells on the ground for my friend and they vanished into thin air.
---
Won't give a refund but will gladly ban people for exploiting a glitch they don't want to fix. Hypocritical perhaps? How many exploiters, dupers, cheaters wouldn't, if they got a refund? More than a few I imagine.
---
To expound.
---
Ammo: weightless
---
MIRV .8lbs
---
Fusion cores .3
---
Rifles 6lbs
---
Pistols 1lb maybe
---
Armor? Doesnt matter because it buffs carry weight amd reduces weapon weight by 20%. Also its 50% lighter.
---
Think man! Pull back and look at the big picture. Study the tools before you and put them to work.
---
I carry like 7 rifles dude.
---
i dont know what you are doing wrong, because i don't get any of theese issues.. not saying they can't fix it and should improve it, I am just curious how people manage it.. I just get the once in a while crash..
---
Please be our Robin Hood
---
It's cool that their listening, but many many issues have been in since FO4. Feel like I dodged a bullet with 76, but I'll pick it up on sale after it's been fixed
---
People have posted this thread several times. They said it would increase, just be patient while they fix issues surrounding server stability. 
---
I really hope this is going to shut dupers down.
---
Great News !
---
Where do you draw the line then? Abusing a glitch is abusing the glitch, dupers are one thing but carry weight glitches also affect servers stability as well, I say perma ban for dupers, and a week or 3 days for carry weight
---
Yeah let’s thank them for turning the game in to what it should have been at launch.
---
Server felt the same and im pretty sure duping still exist.  
---
Starting getting controller disconnected messages, server not responding,  go to map and sure enough, a high and low level off on edge of the map and couple mins later.  Bam.  Disconnected.  
---
I think that's partly the point. You're level 170. Without this XP grind, it'll take a lot of new players wayyyy more time to get to they point. And as far as levels mattering or not, I think it comes down to the convenience of having all of the perk cards you'd like. I'm level 70 and still have dozens of cards on my wish list.
---
Did you dupe or do you have dozens of the same duped item to make it appear that you’ve duped?  If so, you shouldn’t be surprised if action like that may happen. If you have duped items, even if you obtained them in a legit manner like trading or someone giving them to you, or finding them, you shouldn’t be surprised or upset if they get wiped. It’s happened in other games, it’s within the realm of reason ability and possibility. 
---
Make a second character. Either trade the stuff to a friend to give to the alt or drop it in a box in a friends world and go to that box to pick it up. When you want that item do the same thing in reverse. Its called muling. Like pack mule or donkey who carries stuff.
---
I would disagree. I love the uncertainty of any interaction between players but also enjoy the safety of not choosing to participate if I don't want to at any given moment. I think a dedicated pvp server makes sense for those who want more pvp, but don't take some of the very reasons I like the game by making the other servers only pve.
---
this sub is just as dogmatic dude, you are in a cult if you can't see that.  
---
It's gotten so bad to the point where every hour or two of playtime I'm forced to stop at a station or put my C.A.M.P down and sort through my stash/inventory for a considerable amount of time.
---
I genuinely think upping the number to 1000 would really improve the overall experience and stop me from being scared to pick up new gear due to storage limitations.
---
I find getting materials after having my excavator armor easier then before I had them 
---
I run the tier 3 junk reduction perk (15 str +2 from armor) and now just walk around picking up any items I see then scrapping and stuffing unneeded items into containers around train stations (had a lol moment when a noob walked in and found one as I was standing there with a live mic) and I went from barely enough springs to 250+ 
---
also big big helps get the power patcher perk (keep it on always) and fix it good perk slotted when you repair the armor drops your needed materials by around 10% because of repair time 
---
Thanks !
---
Hmm haven’t even considered that... I will look into it and see if I can move anything around to accommodate that. I guess I can prep it as best as I can prior to actually picking up an explosive shotgun
---
Only increased steel and wood sadly
---
I built mine at 25 and rebuilt it at 45 - springs and screws aren't bad if you know where to go for them.  But I'm a pack rat and hoarder too, and I planned in advance.  Black titanium courtesy of Gorge junkyard.  No perks to reduce mat cost - perks are far too important for other things early on in the game.
---
Yea, nobody is forgetting about it lmao. 
---
The stash limit is fine as long as your not hoarding crap. 
---
Don’t use missile/grenade launchers? Don’t keep picking up missiles/40mm grenades. They are unsellable anyway. 
---
Do you really need 20 fusion cores? 
---
Plant food at camp. No longer need to clutter your stash with instamash. 
---
Couple rejuvenating (time heals avatar) armor pieces, healing salve equals less stimpacks. 
---
Not getting anymore blueprints when you scrap a combat rifle? STOP PICKING THEM UP. Their weight to cap value ratio is too low anyways. 
---
Hoarding plans? Read/learn or give them away. 
---
Like heavy armor? Pick the lightweight armor perk. 
---
Like having 3+ PAs? Light weight PA perk is right up your alley. 
---
Are you really going to use 30 buffouts? 
---
Chems are light, easy to find, don’t drop em, sell em. 
---
How much spoiled food you got? 
---
You really gunna keep that legendary 1 Star level 20 Gatling laser gun? 
---
In summary, inventory/stash space is fine for a shared world game. Now inventory MANAGEMENT seems a little lacking for most folks. 
---
You should take into account mutations such as Marsupial and Speed Demon, the downsides are really negligible. Glow Sights and Demo Expert are also good.
---
I just need a sort by total weight and total weight by category. If they are going to put hard limits on total weight, make it easy for me to see what is consuming the limit.
---
It doesn’t seem like you understand the series at all.
---
Just make sure you have a friend in that world so you can join and not have to try and server hop and find it.
---
You need miner miracles quest from garrahan.
---
When it’s done, you get plans for both excavator PA and PA repair station.
---
You can only repair PA, T45 T51.. in a PA station.
---
I don't know if you're trolling or just super ignorant.
---
I dont agree with this at all they didnt hack the game they created 300 items and dropped a few things in a bin.  Sure its an exploit but Beth is at fault just as much as anyone using it.  Reset their accounts let them decide if they dont want to play but bannig them is not right to me.
---
That is going to change now that the cores will be harder to come by. Also, the munitions factory is still taken over quite a bit.
---
I have an explosive laser gatling. One problem is, that the damage is not increased with the Explosive perk card. I wish they would fix this, then I could do a lot more damage with it.
---
I hope this is the next fix.
---
After the patch I haven’t noticed any changes. I crashed 4 times yesterday, which is more than I ever had in one day. Maybe cause I’m still low level I wouldn’t notice. Either way I am sure improvements will continue.
---
That doesn't make the TOS moral or right. 
---
I am against affecting others enjoyment, but I am also against terms and conditions allowing shoddy commercial product to be shipped.
---
A guy called Ralph Nadier called out the US auto industry for this type of thing in the 1960s and effected change. The practice of selling defective interactive entertainment products and hiding behind AUP or TOS will be challenged.
---
Well, there is some bad in there too though. 
---
I’m not for sure if I have the fluxes, I think I have Violet but probably not Cobalt. If you could craft one for me I’ll give you the materials later on today and 500 Caps.
---
What can you do? ;)
---
I bet that Angry is number one in many top 10 worst youtubers list too. 
---
Don't mind these people. The game is fun and it's the only thing that matters(as long as there is enough players).
---
I'd rather they split our one stash into multiple smaller stashes, with their own weight and content limits. Frigdes, med cabinets, scrap and misc pile, cosmetic clothing dressers, notes and quest items and holotapes archive. Then our regular stash box for weapons, armor, ammo and PAs.
---
But that could create confusion for new players if they can't find their meds when they haven't built a med cabinet yet.
---
"We fixed the infinite loading screens and crashes to desktop: we heard not everyone was able to experience this awesome feature, now even more people can enjoy this!"
---
Seriously. I truly appreciate yesterday's patch and the fact that Bethesda seems to listen to us players, but the crashes are waaay more often since yesterday. I'm playing since November, my games crashed maybe two times in the last months - after the patch yesterday it crashed three times in two hours playtime.
---
Reading a patchlog would not assure me in any way. I would wait with praises antil I played the actual game after its patched.
---
This. My mutation neuters chems so I make a killing selling them. I keep 1 med x for emergencies (and a psycho for pvp)
---
Of course I'm lacking it, I was used to FO4 inventory ! But back then, even though I had a sniper build but I was having fun with a Gatling laser gun from time to time but in FO76 no !
---
that's because the fanbase has incompatible groups in it.  some are fans of rpgs, some are fans of open world action titles.  NV is a superior RPG with choice and consequence, branching questlines, skill checks and other RPG mechanics.  FO4 is an open world action game without any of the above except with major exception to Far Harbor.  The issue with this fanbase in general is that here are two generally incompatible genres sharing the same IP and each side is constantly butthurt over the other's preference but Bethesda has clearly sided with the concept of Action RPG Loot and Shoot.
---
U got it buddy
---
THIS GAME FUCKING SUCKS, I WANT A GOD DAMN REFUND
---
Wait...you lose Nick?! Spoilers man. 
---
[Dupers right now.](https://media.giphy.com/media/LRVnPYqM8DLag/giphy.gif)
---
Finding them is just as rare as finding the guns they dupe for me. Never managed to find dupers.when i think the signs are correct i always end up on some random camp.
---
What are the different chassis for? I mean fo4 you had one power chassis and you just had to fit armor to it.
---
i just played from 6:30am to 7:30am with 3 disconnects then i get logged by the train tunnel west and half the world is missing had to disconnect myself. and yes nms was a shitshow the difference here is bethe$da is a $hit$how with hundreds of employees. well back at it i need 54 battered clipboards so i can fix my X-01 power armor left leg
---
No issues for me. Was afraid having to load every round missing would ruin my Quad lever rifle, but i was plesantly surprised that bathesda even made loading single rounds faster! So loading 10-15 rounds doesnt take forever like i was afraid it would!
---
It doesn't - just server hop.  I would do 1 round of the triad - radio array/center and Sugar Grove for screws and springs.  Most days did not need to server hop even.  I usually check to see if there's people nearby/there when I log on first.  You're far more likely to find a gutted Camp McClintock.
---
Honestly surprised they indefinitely banned for a glitch in their game. They could have easily fixed it and given a week ban with a warning of perm ban on next offense. Guess they want those repeat sales :/
---
Is it easier to find and buy? 
---
I stuck an Excavator helmet on T45 Because it was so much brighter and I couldn’t find it in @ most trainyards.
---
Please advise 
---
Anyone ever find out what’s going on with these? 
---
I've never been a fan if banning for item duplication. Should just delete the characters and let people decide if they want to keep playing. Especially if they dont give refunds for buggy games.
---
They arent hackers there was no code broken they created 300 items and drop some stuff in a bin.  This is an exploit not a hack.
---
I had the same thing happen to me. The guy just stood there letting me shoot him and his health stayed just above death after 30+ shots from my TSE shotgun doing 2000+ damage. Something other than TSE is broken here.
---
Give up on the game, firstly its bugthesda were talking about and secondly, its just a bad game.
---
Still find that more believable than making a wall out of 4 scrapped pencils.
---
Dude you shouldve walked in front of THEM whilst they were shooting their TSE. Shooting things too close to the shooter almost instankills themselves due to the explosions.
---
Class freak rank3 
---
You'll reconsider that when you realize that using simply a hazmat suit (which allows for 0 armor under/over), you can effectively remain permanently hidden/caution even from a scorchbeast that directly lands on your face less than a meter from you.
---
are you blind? there is a video in first post
---
also just added another one YT video that was deleted yesterday, its a real proof
---
its about to get nerfed so congrats on wasting your time
---
I thought there was a block option, but I am not sure. Changing servers seems to be the easiest option.
---
/u/LoneVaultWanderer how about if we are going to have a box at home smaller than our backback - how about an inventory system that lets us quickly find the heaviest (in terms of overall % at least) etc so we can get mobile again.
---
I'm walking around with 3x as much shit then I have at camp. And its a nuclear wasteland, there's plenty of room at camp right, let us just dump our shit down at home please. I'll even make another box or 10. Just stop making me limp around everywhere. And then crashing the fucking server right as soon as my bag drops. That's infuriating walking a whole weekend collecting steel and shit to make ammo and then I die because some idiot level 200 spawns in and out and everything spawns and then does me in or something else equally scripted.
---
If my bad hung around it wouldn't be so bad but the servers and the client are so goddam unreliable... urh. I wanted to play this game but honestly it's become more an operation in walking/crawling and frustration than fun.
---
Are you hidden from their map when they're wanted? If so I'd just suggest leaving the area. That is if you can't leave the server for whatever reason 
---
No. It's a glitch, you fuck
---
Well that sucks. May as well of not bought the game. Bethesda should of atleast refunded your friend, afterall your friend would not be banned if bethesda decided to remove the duping glitch earlier or not have it in the game at all... although I am against duping, it's not right.
---
I had to go farm some cobalt to build mines too actually. I'm still on the server I got it from though, so you could join and get the flux right now.
---
If you're on PC, Block them first before you hop servers.  Not Block for Session, do the full Block, it should stop you from being on the same server again.  Do not entertain/retaliate, you're only humoring them and they're getting exactly what they want by causing you to turn on PvP.
---
You are, but they can see my workshops and just wait there.
---
Didn't they just say they fixed that? U on consoles?
---
Thanks but I'm PS4.
---
Thank God I can finally see in my power armor now
---
No. Just....no.
---
I tried to build on this area but couldn't but any floors down on the bridge, how did you manage this? 
---
I understand your point and agree with the graphics and the lore being very misleading. However, I’m still wrapped around why they would consider fo76 a worse disappoint than Atlas which was so hyped up by many and turned out to be completely different, it might be their opinion on which game was more fitting, but I still  feel everyone is trying to just appease viewers.
---
I'd recommend changing life-giver for rejuvenated and either ghoulish or cola nut
---
also vats increases your fusion core drain rate quite significantly 
---
Lastly going more than 1 point in adrenaline isn't really worthwhile so you may want to take born survivor or gun fu
---
Fake. No proof.
---
That's because they slowed down the progression system to make up for the fact that it has no actual content.  There is a reason finding decent plans is nearly impossible
---
Damn...guess I shouldn't have dumped those fusion cores lol...
---
 **Armor:** Fusion Cores will no longer replenish to full charge upon joining another world. 
---
So they ban TWO duper’s who posted glitch exploits on YouTube. 
---
That’s not banning duper’s. That’s banning people teaching people. Still a good thing. But you tubers expose their gamer tags on their channel. 
---
Easier to deal with since they know your GT/PSNID or whatever they call pc. 
---
One youtuber posts a glitch video that ends up with a thousand views. What they gunna do about them huh? 
---
It’s a start, but they sure got a looong way to go with duper’s. 
---
&gt; Youre playing wrong
---
What a sad comment to see in a Fallout forum.
---
Honestly this could just be an edited email (You can do anything with Inspect Element) we will have to wait for more reports on this to see if it's actually happening or not. GJ to Bethesda if it's the latter though. 
---
\[PC\] Since the patch on the 10th January, my reflex sights have been really \[zoomed in\]([https://imgur.com/a/ybg81st](https://imgur.com/a/ybg81st)). Don't have any scoped weapons to test, but iron sights work perfectly. Tried with both the Gauss Rifle and Hunting Rifle.
---
I missed all the perfect polished games from Bethesda like fallout 4 and eso. They really set the bar high on those releases. /s
---
I’m not saying you’re wrong about 76 but the hate storm surrounding has started a culling of the the same bugs and complaints. I think a lot of people and you tubers have severely overstated how buggy the game actually is and have ruined the game for those of us who like it and now can’t convince friends to join us based on biased YouTube reviews.
---
Be your own reviewer everyone, watch streams of actual live gameplay. Decided for yourself.
---
And atlas? Hot garbage, but I don’t need every 12 yo YouTube sensation to tell me that. 
---
Oh no. I have only gotten one good legendary drop at level 123. Adding more kinds of weapons I don't want will make the ones I would like even more improbable.
---

---
Eh, I think a TOS saying if you exploit or cheat in a game your account can be banned is just a standard industry practice.  Nobody wants their game broken or exploited in a way that negatively impacts it.  Just because you CAN doesn't mean you SHOULD. 
---
well i went to log back on and the game crashed to desktop great patch should be a patch for the patch sometime today I remember the good old days when moders fixed bethesda's crap
---
I just keep 100 of each, and pitch the others to friends.
---
What is in the patch notes that is nerfed in reference to this build? A little more info would be nice rather than bring a dick about it...
---
Sure it isn't still loading? I have to wait up to 10 minutes for loot to generate if a lot of players participated 
---
By "Stability", do you mean to say that stash size/limit has an effect on whether or not a crash happens? I have to say the number 1 reason I freeze/disconnect is when I am transferring to an from my stash box.
---
I bought three copies, one for me, two for friends, my friends never played it more than one night, one of whom would not stop bitching about how boring it was begging us to play something else
---
now im the only one who still logs on 
---
I won’t be on until later on today, sometime in the afternoon.
---
You are saying that F, J, and K are among the most used letters in English?
---
This is wrong. The QWERTY key layout was specifically designed to slow typing down so typewriters would not jam up. 
---
It's PC, and was taken after the patch.
---
Who wouldn't want some trench warfare? lol
---
The terms of service are clear about this and the consequences and everyone who plays has agreed to them.
---
&gt; nderstand your point and agree with the graphics and the lore being very misleading. 
---
How is it not misleading to say the graphical detail is 16 times higher when it has the same exact assets and looks substantially worse than 4 in many areas because the LoD issues.  Atlas was also $30, 76 is a full priced game I paid $60 for
---
1 fix on a reload animation + recipe changes.
---
Sure... great.
---
Still no infinite stash and game balance is still f*ed up by the fact we can have level 1s and level 100s on the same map at the same time.
---
Good priorites
---
Also carry extra 1-2 until you get used to the new rate, it is easy to catch you off guard now..  I really wished they had fixed the server crashes before this, twice I was caught with a fusion core at &lt;10% when logging in to a fire fight after a server crash.
---
You honestly think you are helping Bethesda ?
---
Sometimes PA doesn't load so people look like they have Wendigo bodies
---
Not a bad solution but to make it a survival aspect would be cool
---
For example if you are +100 carry weight then your limbs start to break and then you gradually lose health as you walk with broken legs (but if a super has duped stimpaks then this wouldn’t be as effective as your suggestion. 
---
I'd be so happy for some Raider PA paintjobs...
---
My favorite PA is a full Raider set that I found in the wild.  Had a voice recording attached, and remains one of my favorite little random events in the whole game.
---
No worries, send me a message if I'm online when you get on.
---
And I am sertain it is a realy rare bug only a few players have. 
---
He made the active choice to do something that is against the TOS, why shouldn't he be banned?
---
I dont farm items, I farm mobs that drop items.  Its way more fun, and it takes about the same time if you server hop.  
---
Do a little research 
---
What about radaways weight? Is it fixed?
---
I've been server hopping on my alt at Harper's Ferry at levels 25-27 and every fn time that bot has broadsider...so It's not just levels 35-39. I've probably done it 30-40 times and it was broadsider every time but once it had an assaultron blade plan. 
---
Nice!
---
nah you only get banned for using graphics mods in this game
---
that quote doesn't mean what you think it means.  they are saying that because it is very hot in the mojave desert. you can of course twist that to mean the overworld has less dopamine rushes than FO4's endless swarm of mutants around every corner, and that the general overworld would be better served using Fallout 1 fast travel and quest hubs, but it certainly does not mean what you think it means.
---
Yeah we need to beat Fortnite in this building in game competition.
---
Ehhh last I checked energy weps still break after literally minutes. Some in less.
---
No it’s not, the t60 has more paints right now because of people cheating to get the dev room
---
Is the only fix currently scrapping all of your camp and starting a fresh build?  
---
Patrol duty got my on my third attempt
---
&gt;because we actually cant.

[Todd Howard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEKB7pi1mbc)
---
Still waiting for server wipe or a new clean slate server. PVP is broken where everyone has a weapon that one shots and the only reason why I enjoyed the game was to spar with other players.
---
I have noticed that when killing scorchbeasts on a team, you cannot just “tag” it. The others have to shoot it enough to really Agro to a point it attacks you. Just in my experience. Maybe tag has something to do with a % of health and not just one bullet 
---
Yea I can give some steel if you need it
---
Depending on your latency, it can take time to populate containers, also, you need to do at least one successful shot on a target to qualify for loot.
---
Considering using more than 15 maps at a time fucks your game and your inventory for random junk vs duping actual items you can use. Yes I seriously doubt they dupe maps, what would be the point, they don’t sell worth a fuck and take more time to farm than to dupe. 
---
“ They even dupe bobbleheads.....”
---
Yes they do because they are an uncommon item that many give 20% damage increases. You say it like me bobbleheads are junk..... have you ever played a Fallout game? Bobbleheads are just as iconic as the vault boy and you infer that they are worthless.
---
Daily or event?
---
You know what that means!
---
Time to play the above game but switching out T-51 with T-60!
---
Wish you had a pic lol sounds great though
---
That's not how any of this works.

All other mobs activate loot after one tap. Should be the same for SBQ. The event sometimes doesn’t start if you enter late and you have to walk to the market to start it. This only grants you caps and flux after the kill. The actual queen can sometimes be laggy when she drop and can take some time for loot to load. 
---
I guess there is a possibility that since she has so much health and dr the minimum amount of damage to “tag” her could be higher than normal mobs. I always get loot and I do a ton of damage to her. Test it out, it might work better for you.
---
My first shack was built entirely out of pencils, after I extracted the lead to make bullets to defend it!
---
I thought it sold the plans up to 44? I'm 27 now and all it ever has is broadsider...am I completely wasting my time trying to get the handmade plans at 27?
---
I attached it, let me try again.  I looked like I was wearing child sized armor.
---
I wonder how they determine who has dupped, if it's really just as simple as "they have 1000s of really rare things". I did hear about YTers who were open about dupping getting banned.
---
Is there a block on the PS4 for all time, or maybe via PSN?  I know reading in some discussions here all the consoles behave a bit differently.
---
I want a refund because they waited too long to do this, its too late, they've saturated the market, the damage is done, ban them idc, what I want is my money back.
---
Same. No one seems to care where my house is. Only thing bothering me are a few molerats and trash level scortched. 
---
If I did start to get repeatedly attacked by players I'd just leave.
---
None of this applies to workshops of course. That's free game. Shit happens.
---
Yup it breaks twice as fast because degradation is calculated on hit. Put a beam splitter on it and it’ll break in about two magazines. Ask me how I know.... :(
---
According to the patch notes, this is a recognized bug and is being fixed on Pc now and consoles in a few days.
---
I wanna do stuff like that when they finally let me leave free shit around.
---
Gotta milk all that click revenue!
---
god im gonna get downvoted to hell for this but y'know this community blows anyways but this shit honestly is just toxic as fuck to me more then anything 'oh man look at all this time this dude spent on shit and he lost it lmao' fuck him, right
---
"its a video game mechanic!! its the wasteland!! PvP is a feature!!!"
---
its just garbage
---
Sacrifices to the holy Atom must be made. 
---
No worries man, I completely empathize with you on that. It irritates me a bit as well.
---
I never saw it as an exploit as breaking it does not unequip it like other things. Still wearing it and still getting the protection made sense to me. It was never an intend to exploit. And i stand by ghoulish in particular being garbage. Hearing the same from other people. Rad sponge works if you're grouped. Im not sure why your rhetoric has all of these underlying aggressive tones. 
---
Reddit has clear rules against doing that sort of thing. I can vouch for this story, me being the one that launched the nuke at their castle.
---
Never seen an X-01 calibrated shock either...got the jetpack and the stealth boy, but never seen a shock.
---
So you choose to only play a massive multiplayer online game with a few select friends with different schedules than you instead of the thousands of other players online when you are? Lol okay, all sorted out.
---
but at least there was choice and consequence period and every side quest was handcrafted and not radiant kill x at y location.  that is the appeal.
---
you will find that most complaints and critiques of New Vegas are shared among even the greatest admirers of the game like myself.  Do not strawman NV fans into thinking we think it is flawless as we are its biggest critics.  But it provides the absolute core experience of Fallout unlike anything Bethesda has ever made because, as I pointed out above, the IP is split between two largely incompatible genres.
---
Agreed, they took time to make this game (maybe not enough time) but wanted players to get the full experiance without gamebreaking glitches being exploited. So many details went into this game, one roadside mutant camp had 2 different kinds of meat held together with bobby pins to make it look like an animal!
---
Thanks for the input! I haven't even considered mutations just because I have no idea how they work or done much research into them, looking at those 2 though I can see how they help a lot, especially Speed Demon. Appreciate it!
---
Try to buy it from someone on r/fo76bazaar. You wil probably get it quicker there because it's an sub focused on trading.
---
it means cheating
---
Get carnivore and say goodbuy to hunger.
---
which is exactly why they need to just go copy the idea, gamers are fucking stupid, im sure we would hear "why is beth stealing mods from us" even though the QOL would go up greatly. 
---
Yeah maybe if there were passive and combat perks, so I didn't have to keep swapping shit otu.
---
Praise the Lord and pass the banhammer!
---
I have to use the excavator pa at all times or i will be overweight
---
I never heard of any costumes that force a hat on.
---
Yeah, nah. Maybe not a hard cap of 100 'cause I know someone who doesen't dupe and is 200 over their weight around about (low level player) with a full stash... maybe 500 would be acceptable. 
---
Im sure there are some players out there that play completly legit and are way above their weight. Not against this in anyway, I think it's a good idea.
---
Dunno much about coding but you also could just add specific number IDs to all items in the game and no certain item has the same ID. The numbers are hidden behind the games code of course, but basically the only way to get the same ID of an item is to dupe... That's *A* solution if your trying to find a way to detect duping.
---
Absolutely, and almost every time I'm not sure I already had it.
---
Excavator armor in lucky hole mine changed my life for getting lead
---
I like how it's made me adapt and get over my in-game hoarding mentality.
---
Though I wouldn't mind it being raised a bit, like to 1k.
---
Great now everyone will be in my hideaway spot.....
---
Alright thanks man
---
it would only be 'scary' if you're a cheating piece of shit.
---
someone get this guys IGN and get him banned asap
---
Yeah...I was hoping for a stash bump as well...another 200 lbs would be lovely.
---
I'd like to see more of the items we had available in 4. The files are there. They just need to spend some time converting them.
---
Also, I would happily rebuy the slocum's joe pack (provided it wasn't mental fucking pricing) to be able to turn my camp into a coffee shop once player vending came out. 
---
Found that last night myself, more of a slight inconvenience. Id rather that than the other issues!!
---
Stash space never been low. 400 was already enough. 
---
Hopefully the desire for killing you for your junk in a nuke zone is reduced now since hardened mass is no longer junk. Pacifist mode on in a nuke zone, and protect your junk by going in without the good stuff on you.
---
Yet DemonAsylum still not banned...   
---
Should be a map marker indicating its a "town" of players, easier for trading etc.
---
Can confirm, had the same bug yesterday
---
Prepare your Anus
---
Segfault...
---
Works on the queens ranged attack and orbital strikes too
---
Same lots of just really sudden crashes.
---
1. Witch hunting is real and there are real, important reasons we don’t do it. Just because he is banned doesn’t mean he still doesn’t use that PSN, Live account, ID, etc for other games and services. Asking for information that can be used for a witch hunt is just poor form. Really poor form... Even if it weren’t against the rules, it’s just a repugnant thing to do from an ethical standpoint.      
---
2. Multiple people have posted links to the image of the email and an article. Their comments are older than yours. The article has comments from the YouTubers that got banned, themselves. Did you even bother to read the small handful of comments on this post before commenting? There is not much more you can ask for for proof without posting too private of information (see point 1, plus the site-wide rules against witch hunting). 
---
It's so much more scrap than he could have ever possibly used in practical terms. Why in the world was he carrying around so much on him in the first place? My personal rule of thumb is that withe the exception of a few things like springs, which you can never have enough of, I'll just drop or sell anything above 150 units of any type of scrap. Past that point and it's just more trouble than it's worth. 
---
We are clearly having two different conversations. 
---
I am considering the morality of selling defective product hiding behind TOS. Cheating is an associated, but other, issue.
---
Just because an industry does something doesn't make it right or sustainable, as consumer activism driven legislation has proven through history.  
---
If you are not interested in consumer policy and economic history, and want to focus on spamming or whatever, lets stop now.
---
I get an average of 2 crashes in a 4-hour session on PS4, often right after I've just killed a bunch of enemies to clear out an area.
---
I would say that if you don't want a bounty, become a true Pacifist.  I won't kill you even if you gave me caps and junk and more.  Anyone with a bounty is prime meat for a block, cause I just don't do PvP period in this game.
---
There is no such thing as an accidental bounty - if you get one it tells me you're simply not Pacifist.
---
you're stupid.
---
Of all the things we do in this game, the one I find really stretches my imagination is the idea of repurposing wood. Metal, plastic, sure. I once saw a show where a man made fuel to run an engine from decaying pigs.
---
But unless you're doing some particle board, and from the look of our walls, we aren't, wood doesn't make sense. I'd love to see them remove it from scraping and what you get when doing junk. More so since you can gather your wood. he he he. 
---
You can also just park your power armor at an empty station in the world and do the repairs there..that's what I've been doing.
---
I don’t think that’s true. 
---
You have to remove the higher level pieces off the chassis into your inventory, then you can jump in and claim the frame/chassis. 
---
Exit out of the frame and then you can put the high level pieces back on. 
---
You won’t be able to jump back into it because it’s too high of a level, but now if you wait 60 seconds it will recall back into your inventory. This way it only takes up 10 lbs. and not take up the wait if each individual piece. 
---
Then you can store that frame with pieces attached in your storage box where it will be safe. 
---
Also, you don’t unlock plans for scrapping power armor pieces, just material. So better to sell if you get extra. 
---
Nice. The sound is the best part of the tambo. Glad it matches now.
---
And .01 percent read it if even that. Dont use that as a defence. Permanent ban for something that they refused to acknowledge for how long? Then dont bother to do anything else about any other "breaches" of the service. It's kinda dumb, I have never duped cause I haven't cared too, was still getting killed by people with explosive guns long before the glitches became widespread. It changed nothing, and let people get weapons that their luck told them otherwise.
---
what... every game no matter how branching it is is going to have an end-state.  There will always be a battle for Hoover Dam, sure, but there are dozens of decisions that precede that.  That is the appeal.  In Fo76 there are zero decisions in the main quest whatsoever and the biggest decision is when you will decide to spec into melee, the only weapon that is consistently OP without being TSE
---
I do the same, bullet sponges get my tse gatling to the face, everything else gets my suppressed handmade non legendary lol
---
Exploiting a glitch that shouldn't have been there in the first place.
---
Never blame the creators of course*
---
Will not allow refunds but will ban players for glitching, glitches they don't want to fix and have been around since FO 4. Bethesda is a hypocrite, thief, and flat out liars. 
---
Welcome to the list of never buying from again. Have a seat next to EA and make yourself comfy. Enjoy the loot boxes in the new Skyrim.
---
ASD? If you check check your previous post, see how many times they were used. Also agree on the issue on spreading the letters to avoid the hammers of typewriters jamming 
---
What a well thought out retort.  You are whats wrong with communication on the internet.
---
If he was, then he deserved it 
---
This game should be in top 10 controversal games of 2018 but not top 10 worst games. Angry Joe gave it a 3/10 score and debated to actually give it a 2/10 score. That is like puting it below a 1$ indi game with tetris graphics that has 1 hour worth of content. I unsubscribed from Angry Joe after seing his review becsuse that score and hatred was undeserved. It made me change my opinion about him, he now seemes obvious that he is a pure singleplayer fanboy and wanted to punish Bethesda for making a multiplayer survival game. I saw more reviews from him and he even rated Red Dead Redemption 2 purely on the singleplayer part saying he didn't played the multiplayer part of it because he hates and can't stand multiplayers.
---
[i had this bug myself not long ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fo76Memes/comments/adgvo4/and_from_the_vault_76_came_the_cheesy_one/)
---
lol Atlas
---
You can’t just put an extractor anywhere. Like you can your camp. You can’t keep a workshop indefinitely. You may or be able to get a workshop at all. You are still scavenging with a node you have to go to and build around. 
---
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME NOODLES... MA'AAA'AAM?
---
you are unhinged
---
Same i keep about 10 of each bulk material and 100 of it cannot be bulked. I like to make sure i have everything. Obviously the more rare stuff i have more space for, Utracite scrap, ballistic fiber, screws.
---
tesla rifle is technically a heavy weapon so that might have something to do with it. 
---
If they do put to 1000 then you will be right back here in a month talking about how it should be 1500 because there just isnt enough room
---
I'm level 20 and my best weapon is a sledgehammer with 74 in dmg or something so no, I'm not a cheater
---
Indeed, that's why it's important to report people with insane inventories.    
---
Until next patch you can check their inventory on console by offering a trade and pressing the right stick twice quickly.     
---
A screenshot of their first inventory tab (where the username is shown instead of 'weapon' 'armor' etc.) with duped items should be enought I guess.
---
That's only like 2 to 3 pounds.
---
I need all of those healing items so my visiting nurse (complete with outfit and hat) can leave "get better bags" all over the place.
---
No, go ahead and use them
---
It’s an event trying to collect all weapon plans personally the handmade plans dropped on the third clear just server hop until it pops up. 
---
Sounds like: "I saw you write that, along with 1bajillion other players on here... but we may or may not do shit about it."
---
Hide behind your brotherhood flair... I see you raider 
---
I think its time for a change of occupation. 
---
If you don’t let the legendaries respawn health than your loot will always be crap. TSE is the worst weapon for legendaries.

Alright right on I'll have to check that out, what location does it occur in

Nuka-Girl spacesuit 
---
Everytime my camp gets packed away, i move it elsewhere and it has a duplicated blueprint of the building. Will i get banned, depsite this not being my fault?
---
&gt; You're not very bright, are you? You completely missed the point that size wasn't the only factor, other factors, like density, matter. So does muzzle velocity, in case of fire arms ammunition is comes from pressure, so the amount of powder, the burn rate of said powder, the length of the barrel, etc... 
---
What did I tell you about semantics? And you think I'm not the bright one... \* sigh \* Moron.
---
Yes, I studied physics. I know how that shit works. Most of this isn't relevant because we're not comparing shooting a .38 vs throwing a .45 round or whatever many other specific cases you can think up. 
---
In the specific context of the same weapon chambered with two different rounds, all other things **mostly** being equal, more mass = more energy = more ouchy.
---
I bolded "mostly" because given how anally retentive you are, you'd probably bring up some semantic issue of same grain count or something bone-headed that's not relevant to the current context like that.
---
Do I really need to dumb it down for you and spell out every specific condition?
---
&gt; Comparing apples and oranges now, aren't ya? .45 does more dmg than .38 on the same weapon in Fo76. 
---
If comparing weapons using the exact same round isn't comparing apples with apples, I don't know what is.
---
Maybe you wanna give that one a re-do?
---
I've been waiting for the lever-action patch since launch! But while it may be fixed *numerically*, it's not actually perfect.
---
When you top off the mag tube you eject what would be your sixth round (5 in tube + 1 in the chamber). So while the weapon *does* contain five rounds, it can *actually* hold 6. Or, if it can only hold 5 (as in 4+1), you would need to load four rounds, chamber a round, then load the fifth, if reloading from empty.
---
Have a full set of t60 need left arm for t 51
---
I seem to be getting a burst of “server controls disabled”, usually 5-6 and then a disconnect back to the main menu.  Not sure if it is server or network based but looking at the trace routes and response times I think the timeout limits on the servers might be a bit too tight.
---
I'll add you if u don't mind,willing to pay caps and provide materials for ur efforts,be in later today, cheers
---
what is your threshold of legitimacy. 
---
I carry over 3000 weight in items around all the time legitimately, would you ruin my gameplay just to get back at someone else. To make a threshold high enough to effect dupers without breaking gameplay for legitimate players inherently won't effect dupers, they can freely create a hundred mule characters to store things so no one profile goes over their carry limit, or are you going to put a limit on how many characters you can create. Does only having max three characters, none of which can hold more than X weight sound like a good thing, just hack out player options so you can't play the game a certain way just to make a tiny number of people turn to slightly different methods to do the same thing.
---
People should just not purposely exploit the game to attempt to get an upper hand on other players. 
---
Everyone who plays the game is negatively affected by **any** and all duping, from the guy duping hundreds of TSE’s to the guy who thought he could “just do it to make a few more stimpacks” 
---
It still unbalances the game
---
This. There needs to be ways to build more home storage. Make extra stash boxes cost more. I'm thinking of ark. Your basic stash box was small and cheap. You want to store more, learn the plans, gather more supplies, and build it.
---
With the weight reduction perks carrying around your junk makes.more sense than storing it
---
So there’s this thing called a stash...
---
Well, that won't work if the duper just dupes and stacks "Grognak the Barbarian #9" and increases their carry weight to \*insert huge number here\*
---
I never in my life can imagine having that much caps in fallout 76
---
They can still grief if they find your camp.  The slap system absolutely should be extended to CAMP objects.
---
Yeah pretty much agree with you. I trust steam reviews and my own 2 hour before a refund for my opinions (or whatever launcher etc, you get what i mean). As for fo76, i haven't bothered buying it on my pc but ive had hang outs where id have to say i have about 20 hours of expereince. Yes, fuck Atlas.
---
While im not one of the ones that is calling it shit storm of a buggy game, it has still been a broken and boring expereince. And again, being the fanboy after this company, its a bullet to the chest when it comes to the standards ive built up from their previous releases. Shit just a few hours ago i started a new run on Original fallout (diffrent devs but still a company as a whole) (I died from an encounter of mole rats and forgot to save, didn't focus charater traits on physical traits).
---
I have seen them fixing things but I think im still far off from owning it and wanting to put hours in for myself rather than just going over to a friends place and running around in co op.
---
Finally. Fuck them.
---
Good thing youre not in charge then 
---
Its a good start but doesn't explain why Bethesda took so long to act on this problem because large aspects of the game's economy have been ruined from this and aren't easily fixable without punishing honest players.
---
There is a new addition to the fire resistant perk, check it out. Also dense mod for the chest.
---
Easy don’t do exploits, problem solved they are banning bargain bin yourubers not the prominent ones 
---
I hope this is true...please let it be true!!! lol
---
What do you mean focus on spamming?  That seems fairly rude and judgmental of you. I figured we WERE having a conversation.
---
Every game has bugs, every game has issues, every game has potential exploits.  It's just how programming works.  There is NO perfect program out there.  To protect themselves, companies have Terms of Service allowing them to protect their product from those that would exploit those bugs and issue to give them a leg up, an unfair advantage, or what have you.
---
Just because that protection for the company is there doesn't mean they are "hiding" behind the TOS.  Is Microsoft hiding behind their TOS just so they can later update Windows?  Is Apple doing the same for MacOS or iOS?
---
No, those companies are protecting themselves which they have every right, moral or otherwise, to do.  No company has EVER released a perfect product that didn't need any updates, any fixes, any recalls, etc.  Consumer Policy is definitely there to help protect us against the worst of the worst, but is Bethesda banning people who willingly exploited a game, knowingly going against the ToS, really the hill you want to die on?  It's a game.  It isn't a car, a life saving piece of software, medical equipment, etc etc.  You run around and shoot ghouls with a gun that has exploding ammo or hit them with a sledgehammer that has a rocket attached to the back.  I think it makes little sense to worry about this when there are, I'm sure, MUCH bigger and more important battles to pick.
---
I would say that this video presents a STRONG counterargument against your position. You don't risk losing weapons, armour, chems and such when you die. 
---
It does ?
---
https://youtu.be/S02BHmWPZNs
---
This is what you signed up for
---
I mean if it didn't crash the servers would it matter? This game basically plays single player and short of any hacking it's basically impossible to kill another player unless they shoot back. I think a perma ban is dumb, honestly a warning makes about a million times more sense  
---
Which is exactly why I think the issue is more complex. Just because an easy fix exists doesn't mean it's the property way to go about doing something. While they *could* just add the "needs to be manually scrapped" tag to every mod in the game, that would leave the door open for them to either A) miss a mod or two in the initial sweep, or B) forget to do it when adding new mods as future content. A proper, more robust solution would be to change the way that "scrap all" works in the first place, to handle junk and mods differently from the get-go, which eliminates the two potential issues I've mentioned. It should - and I'm sorry for saying this- *just work.*
---
Lol. "Whoa whoa whoa I want those cheaters banned all (i.e. me) cheaters banned"!
---
I've gotten something similar to that too on occasion. Seems very world-based though. Log back in and then I'm fine.
---
I guess they still have a very long way to go in terms of resolving the stability issue.
---
To your own credit you identified the behavior of that item as different. Intended or not you're facing that behavior as being altered to be similar to other items. Rationalizing to me is unnecessary.
---
Rad Sponge does indeed work if you're grouped. Says such on the card. If you are not grouped you can just as easily use chems.
---
I am unsure why you've chosen to identify something as rhetoric but unable to make a personal reflection. There's no aggression here - literally just facts with a highly opinionated stance that a bug was squashed. If you don't agree you should not infer them as insults even if this is an emotional subject for you.
---
Holy delusion batman. Yes. You ARE the QA.
---
^
---
I crafted Trapper earlier on, especially when I first got pocketed capabilities. Though I run a PA build, I still have mostly crafted pocketed robot setup underneath now, except for one legendary autostim combat arm I picked up in Whitesprings or the Mire.
---
Agreed. That guy spent his lifetime on this trash gathering, but it's his trash, he was collecting in. Put your goddamn hands away from it.
---
Im not saying he shoulden't of been banned, im saying he wasted his money on a game that now he can't play?  I edited my original post aswell...
---
You understand this is pretty clearly fake right?
---
If you have Rank 3 Class Freak, the -4 int from Marsupial becomes -1, with the ability to jump really high and +20 carry weight, that's a great deal, makes the game more fun. 
---
I'm a hoarder, I can't help it. I just feel like if I was truly trying to survive that I'd want to keep every scrap and screw because I might not know when the next one comes around.
---
Obviously I've had to work on my stash management and have gotten rid of things that I normally wouldn't, but it's a bummer. In every game like this, I'm often the "warehouse" among my friends. It's weird to not have that role.
---
Your comment makes no sense. What are you trying to say?
---
Fireproof perk now adds explosive resistance.That and the dense mod, you can stick your TSE where the sun don't shine.
---
 It what it says, it is worded poorly but they said they didnt at all on the alt. 
---
I tried it yesterday after the patch, didn't work with melee bobbleheads but was 100% working with explosive bobbleheads..  if you really don't believe it I can show you me 1 shotting a SBQ with an explosive shotgun that does 200k damage.. also managed to bug the curator perk card so it gave me 4 hours of effects..
---
Yeah.  People choosing this hill to die on baffle me.  Like...it's a game.  I'm sorry it's not perfect?  That doesn't mean you should exploit the game and break the TOS that you agreed to.
---
&gt;But to change specials you have to get like 25 levels to change points from perception to strength, 
---
Well, maybe 14 levels.
---
Energy weapons will still be un-usable
---
Overloading a character for the purpose of BYPASSING the stash limit is an exploit.   There is no argument against that, you are justifying your cheating by saying it's been done in the past.  There really isn't anyway for a Dev to stop this without restricting legitimate transactions.
---
Good.
---
Somebody lvl 130+ was standing on the roof of Whitespring Golf Club a couple days ago with something like a 240 bounty. I fast traveled in to see what's going on and saw the above. Gun drawn, he gives me the 'come closer' emote. Ah no, I'm fine down here, thanks!
---
&gt;The AI is easily the worst of any game I have played in my entire life for enemies as well
---
It's smarter AI than FO4, Enemies run away if they can't hit you and AI Scorchbeasts have a really interesting searching for you while you are hidden pattern that i'm fairly sure Skyrim dragons didn't have.
---
&gt;only draw to play is the grind and perk system.
---
I love the Perk Card System, way better than FO4s IMO, sure I'm in my menu a lot but I'm one of those players anyways 
---
Re watch all the the hype and talks about this game. Tod and devs talked on so much about how beautiful this game was suppose to be. If you seriously have issues with finding any of it, ill be glad to link.
---
I was helping some new players yesterday, we were doing the main quests, when we were in Flatwoods these 3 guys, 2 in PA, showed up, the third guy had the glitch, I tried to distract them to let my guys get out of there, they attacked my camp.
---
oh sure its the creators that made them dupe. sure bugs and glitches happen and the creators should fix them, but abusing them is the players decision. 
---
You just described Early Access. However you sound the type to attack anyone calling 76 early access.
---
I dont pay for a plate of nothing for the restaurant to then guess what I feel like having on my plate that night. 
---
Lucky, my last bounty I got was 30 caps total took 3 days of begging to get someone to put me down

What do you think of this?

Defective cars and millions of lines of code are 2 totally separate cases. It's very understandable when creating these online worlds that there will be unforeseen consequences. You can really only drive a car. Not really applicable. It's like saying one person can drive from the back seat, while the next person can drive from the trunk. Its completely up to you! Then I'd say you'd have a case.
---
**WRONG**! and it really bothers me that so many people assume this.
---
I'm at level 82 and currently have 4 TSE weapons, I have traded off 2 others and lost a really nice one from a game glitch, one was given to me by a much higher level player I met and chatted with (I'm certain he's not a duper either), so 6 of them were acquired legitimately through grinding the Events &amp; Blast Zones which I've done a lot of since level 40.
---
I have never used any exploits in the game even though I had the pocketed armor to do it with, with one unavoidable exception, The CAMP duplication Glitch haunted me for weeks, and the only way to fix my Water Purifier when it happened was to scrap all the duplicated items, but I would promptly distribute the spoils into containers around the starting areas, which was needed to free up stash space.
---
To date, I would estimate that I have killed around 600 Legendary enemies from which I have received around 400 Legendary Items (sometimes they glitch and disappear, or just don't have the loot on them) I have done this by hunting for and Cherry Picking Legendary enemies as a Stealth/Sniper build Character, so please, **Don't assume that just because you haven't gotten any good weapons yet that all who have done so by cheating.**
---
I found out that the the sludge lung disease also makes you extra over-encumbered (snail), but the AP bar doesn't reflect the hit
---
I literally just found this spot last night! im still low level though so dont fancy setting up camp here just yet!
---
Its a event 
---
I mean, I can understand that viewpoint, but alternatively if he hadn't of broken the ToS he could have still been playing.  He didn't waste his money so to speak, he gave it to Bethesda and then fucked himself over.  
---
I saw someone say that it wasn't being affected by Speed Demon before but is now. That might account for the snappy reload.
---
7 vendors with 200 caps pool per 24 hrs, easy.
---
It’s going to be( I hope) ESO all over again. 1 year of almost passable nonsense and then massive updates to content and bug fixing. ESO became everything I want for 76 but we’re still a ways off. I just don’t want to see critical game reviews kill this game before it has a chance to become great. That’s why I’ll continue to play and support the devs along the way, even if I’m the last online player in Appalachia.
---
Can I grab it from you tonight after work? That would be such a lifesaver! FisherFan is my gamer tag. 
---
Jesus, you guys running a junkyeard?
---
Many people have, not very effective, takes about 5% of health
---
Fixed in yesteday's patch for me.
---
&gt; It's smarter AI than FO4, Enemies run away if they can't hit you and AI Scorchbeasts have a really interesting searching for you while you are hidden pattern that i'm fairly sure Skyrim dragons didn't have.
---
Are you being serious?  9/10 times when I walk into a room all the AI is just standing there not moving until I shoot them, then they start falling down on themselves trying to get to you and missing completely.  The Scorchbeast AI is so insanely bad that even most people who say the game is good admit that scorchbeasts are totally messed up, I can send you literally hundreds of videos showing this
---
&gt;I love the Perk Card System, way better than FO4s IMO, sure I'm in my menu a lot but I'm one of those players anyways
---
Yeah the perk system is about the only thing that kept me engaged
---
What's the location of it or where it's around
---
I farm the behemouth in the lake SE of whitesprings. If you jump servers enough times you eventually get a legendary. Got a Prime Plan from him once.
---
Release the game without such bugs n glitches and you wouldn't have the problem in the first place
---
Why do they put this room on live servers? Isnt it enough to have this on their in-studio builds of the game? Seems very dangerous to have, and as we see now it is exploitable.
---
There was a post about Vim! PA paint plans a little while back. I guess the plan came from this dev room.
---
"They didn't give me a refund so I demand that they allow me to cheat!" - this guy
---
Happily though, this was fixed in yesterday's patch for me.
---
He had Power Armor Fists+Whatever mods on his arms
---
I've completed that quest. It's not always the same camp so the example given that you got from Googling doesn't always apply.
---
If you haven't already done so, go to the quest in the pipboy and hit whatever key shows you that quest on the map. It should indicate which camp you need to hit.
---
[Update based off of your recommendations...](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f623d89&amp;d=sd2so2sp2su2sb2pc2p02cu2s12ih2as2a00lt2lr2ic4a72lv2ek1ib1a30&amp;w=&amp;n=Final%20Shotgun%20PA)
---
What do you think of this, I will have to maybe tweak it more at some point to accommodate starched genes when I decide to go that route.
---
Yup!
---
Take a screenshot in game? If you're on PS4 you can share via message, save to your phone via message app, then there you go. Not sure the method for Xbox. 
---
Your mother should have swallowed you
---
I love the assaultrons helmet because it moves
---
I don’t agree with anything you’ve said and I genuinely feel like any toxicity you felt from this post is easily outweighed by the stupidity of carrying around that much junk if you actually care about it.
---
Either idiot, duper or doesn't need that sh#t. After level 70 most of the junk pretty much loses its value.
---
No no no lol these guys can leave. are you worried about your account?
---
Oh it’s animated ? That sounds sweet 
---
Do you have mutations? Apparently having decimals breaks the perk. So if you lose 0.25 STR from a mutation, it breaks the perk. I'll check when I get on, really curious.
---
A tiny fraction causing this uproar and servers crashing? Give me a break.
---
&gt;Yes, I studied physics
---
Start again then, because if you think a 5.56 upper on an AR-15 does less damage than a 9mm one, you're wrong.
---
&gt;all other things mostly being equal, 
---
And that's precisely where you're wrong. They are *not* equal, you only assume they are.
---
&gt;the exact same round
---
See above. It's not the same round, only the same calibre. And a flint lock musket shooting a .50 ball won't match a Barrett shooting .50 any time soon.
---
A student of physics should know better than to make assumptions and look at the actual data.
---
Kiting to the guards is a time-honored MMORPG tradition, going back to Everquest.
---
In addition, I'm not saying that 76 isn't a shitshow.  It absolutely is and THAT is definitely wrong.  We were absolutely sold an incomplete product and they deserve every bit of backlash they get for that.
---
However, that doesn't give someone the right to break a ToS that they agreed to because they don't like the game.
---
Oh my god... 
---
Thank you so much. This was driving me nuts.
---
Same story here. I build right behind the clubhouse but I have zero turrets set up and I have a nice big deck that allows you to murder ghouls without them touching you and with marsupial you can shoot both floors of the clubhouse from the comfort of my home. I have a full suite of crafting stations, a purifier, and a ground water pump to make boiled water
---
Sure thing.  You're the second person to ask for that.  I'm just about to the point that I'm going to get mutated so I'll do that.
---
It opens when you sheath your weapon and closes when you pull it out. 
---
It was worth it for small batches if you needed acid in a pinch and were running out. Instead of going scavenging for 20 minutes, you could just sit at a bench for 5 minutes to build up a decent stack to do whatever you needed with it (usually smelting).
---
They're pretty much in the same area (as well as others around The Forest) that I describe for Starlight Berries)
---
Nothing is good enough. 
---
You sir deserve all the karma possible
---
Over 3000? How can you cope being unable to sprint or fast travel? I would be going nuts.
---
I have an 2\* instigating (2x when full HP) Grognak Axe with plus 40% power swing damage lvl 50 238 base damage with no meds. (power swings do 666 damage) With incisor perk I can 1 hit pretty much everything except scorched beast by far my favorite weapon. And I follow up with an executioners Super Sledge 50% extra damage when under 40% HP
---
Yes melees are OP however 
---
However I've yet to find a 2 shot gun I'm level 81 and farmed hundreds of legendary enemies.
---
That’s cool I think il try that out 
---
2 months pass from launch and you already want all the mods? People that play wow from years and still play to get that weapon they want!
---
GOOD! They profited by encouraging many players to exploit and ruin the game. They got what they deserve. I hope they go after those idiots on their comment section as well 
---
You're still a beautiful prince in my eye. Just not Enclave enough.
---
The weird thing about Cranberry Bog is sometimes regular cranberries are in certain places and other times it's all diseased cranberries.  I can't figure it out.  Anyway, I was trying to make the list using the locations most accessible to the lowest level players.
---
Nobody here cares or can help you. 
---
I love this, because I do this! There’s no reason everyone can’t participate in killing the biggest baddest beasty. We’re at the point of end game where end game builds make up for lower tier damage. I killed SBQ with a level 32 there last night. It’s good to see other people doing the same.
---
Welcome to end game brother, Ad Victoriam 
---
If I am required to eat and drink as part of the survival aspect of the game's mechanics, I don't have a problem with a maximum carry weight as part of that same mechanic. 
---
Can you give me a specific location?  I've never seen them.
---
I think you are right on this. It sounds like repair costs scale with item level now. Also they made crafting certain armor pieces require ballistic fiber. Before everyone complained why is ballistic fiber required to repair armor if it is not required to build it, hoping Bethesda would remove the requirement instead Bethesda added it to crafting it. I am sure a dev giggled when they made that change.
---
It was definitely most certainly a toxic thing to say that the community sucks, but understand me-- All complaints and issues I've stressed when it comes to how players take advantage of situations at the expense of other players? I have been met with criticism to the idea. Which baffles the mind. Fun is fun. PvP is fun. But taking that much from people comes at their expense, and it is completely and utterly their expense. I just can't in any rational mind support that or think that's fair or don't think that's kind of dick, you know?
---
And it really isn't as simple as, 'don't carry all that weight' -- That sort of reasoning is why we have alts with tens of thousands of pounds of weight. (even without duping in mind) that has led to some of the same issues that we had with the carry weight bug.
---
I’m just thinking from the dev’s perspective, do you think they wanted all this feedback? 
---
Healing Factor and Speed Demon are deffo good in any build. Rest is based on what you're speccing in
---
I totally meant to put a E instead of a W
---
Yep. 100% intended. Definitely wasn't an accident
---
I'm with you on that!  I wish we could plant starlight berries and pumpkins.  Pumpkins especially seem like a no brainer.
---
yes
---
i will send this man to nirvana myself if i have too
---
That is true, but what about the others that got away with duping? In the end it's all just a game. Unless he is causing serious server crashes than he probably shoulden't of deserved to be banned. If he got banned for duping, than what about the other 1/8th or even a 1/4 of the community? Maybe a bit less but either way. I haven't read the full post but so far I think we need more context onwhat he actually did to be justified whether he should of been banned or not.
---
Anyone who workshops carrying 800+ adhesive is just asking for a bad time.
---
*laughs in poor*
---
I, like you, think they are doing great and dont deserve all the shit they had from angry kids. 
---
Most likely just lucky. I find it takes around 10 armour scraps of same kind to get a mod. And the more mods I already have - the less chance, it seems
---
76 *has* NPC's you just don't like them. If they put in the human NPC's that people keep whining about, despite the fact that they made it very clear up front that they wouldn't exist in this game, people would just kill them and cause others to whine. If they made it so they couldn't be killed people would whine. The only difference between a human NPC and a terminal is the shape of the NPC that's feeding text to you. 
---
Unstable isotope, electrically charged, plague walker to add the other guys comment 
---
For me it has been worse than ever after patch.
---
Go out and come back.
---
"...have barely done any duping or mass crafting recently..." 
---
Dude, please define "barely done" and "recently" because this sounds an awful lot like "yeah, we've been duping and mass crafting even after being banned, but I don't know why they're all pissy about it 'cause we took the weekend off!"
---
which they have something for that automatically checks if you're using it and reports to Bethesda, who then ban you.
---
I have here a sneaker that's tattered and worn
---
It's all full of holes and the laces are torn
---
A gift from my mother the day I was born
---
I love it because it's trash
---
Oh, I love trash!
---
Anything dirty or dingy or dusty
---
Anything ragged or rotten or rusty
---
Yes, I love trash
---
I have here some newspaper thirteen months old
---
I wrapped fish inside it; it's smelly and cold
---
But I wouldn't trade it for a big pot o' gold!
---
If you're looking for an argument about that, you're on the wrong board.
---
FIINAAAALLYYYY
---
I would love it if you could place your camp into the bounds of your friends camp. So you got double the space where you both can build. But i could see how that wouldnt work
---
What? I think the game is plenty beautiful. The world is one of its best features. 
---
i definitly do! i have all the mutations except empath and i am using the perk to reduce the downsides.  so this breaks it?   0.25 str malus is definitly something i could have,  herd mentality + solo + reduced downsides.  so if this is true, the perks ARE worthless for me.  well s\*\*\*
---
Or you know, they could be texture mods on the person's client.
---
It’s not like this is the future of fallout either; I wrote an article about this over the summer, it’s here to keep us fans at bay until the next game. 
---
Let's start the dupe police!!!! 
---
We could rock the full cop gear and stop players to inspect their inventories. 
---
&gt;which they said was the reason
---
can you cite that? not calling you out or anything, but for weeks now dupers have been blamed for this, but I haven't seen any evidence or source for the info. Obviously dupers need to be stopped/punished, Im just wondering where the link between the two came about.
---
Is that the response to every problem that people have in this game? 
---
Nice build! Where do you get the nuka fridge plans?
---
A slightly annoying issue is some slider boxes now will go to max if you go below 0.  It is really rough if you are use to spamming left trigger to 0 out.  I give away alot of scrap, but now I just confuse the low-bies by selling them 25k Settlement plans.
---
Doesn't really mean anything until there are much more reports. The people on this sub want to beleive anything that would make this game more positive.
---
&gt;It's not the same round, only the same calibre. 
---
Omg... you think that the .45 ammo that used for a combat rifle in the game isn't the same ammo that is also used in the upgraded .45 pipe rifle...?
---
I have no words buddy. Your statement speaks for itself.
---
&gt; And a flint lock musket shooting a .50 ball won't match a Barrett shooting .50 any time soon. 
---
Oh hey look, our old friend false equivalence has come visited us again.
---
Idiot. smh
---
Losing junk isn’t the end of the world and it’s not even necessary to have to be able to enjoy the game. Out of anything you could criticize the game for this one seems extremely mild if it’s even a problem at all.
---
I’m not, at all. 
---
Melee will never harm me unless I stagger, ever. Bleeds do more then melee
---
This is a 'grow with it' game like ESO is, I couldn't believe everyone who said it was gonna get abandoned and taken as a loss to the company lol
---
I just CTDed for the first time since I played this game instead of disconnecting, I think it has something to do with the update.
---
Not a programmer.
---
When players are trading, ones inventory becomes transparent to view by another. I think PA frames included. Could this be a roadblock for mentioned solutions?
---
Ya getting stuck in your power armor sucks...nice RP work around though.
---
I don't think you can have multiple max rank cards. So if you have Rank 3, Rank 2 and Rank 1 you won't be offered any and won't get any dropped from card packs every 5 levels. That way you have the flexibility to swap out the cards when a particular rank is needed.
---
If you're in PA they're just an annoyance.  Yesterday I fast traveled to what I thought was a Horde Event near the General's Steakhouse, but it put me out in the open standing up and not in stealth right in the middle of the pit to enter Glassed Caverns (luckily in PA).  I ran all the way to The Mire killing 3 scorchbeasts, a ton of scorched humans, two deathclaws and a couple anglers.  It was madness.  They just kept coming and coming and coming.  I thought I'd never get away.  I had 3 guns break on me (gatling plasma, The Dragin and minigun which I had just looted, at which point I stopped trying to kill stuff and just kept running lol.
---
I'm pretty sure I read that reading someone's inventory without them accepting a trade was fixed in the last patch.
---
Almost all online game TOS include this provision and for good reason. It is a good provision that protects consumers. This isn’t even close to comparable the US auto industry and trying to make that comparison is unreasonable. Players agreed to a TOS that says in order to have continued access to an online game, they agree not to knowingly use exploits. They then use exploits that damage the player experience. We get it. You hate Bethesda and 76, but being a duper apologist to try and push your agenda is just nonsense. 
---
&gt; 76 has NPC's you just don't like them.
---
No it doesn't, Grahm is the closest thing.  A vending bot is not a character, it is a list of stuff.  There is no dialog with anything in this game, literally at all
---
The story is we came out of a vault and are piecing together wtf happened to everyone. The terminals and holos are absolutely part of the story. 
---
I wonder what the bounty would be for launching a Mini Nuke in the middle lol.
---
I have phantom weight and I didnt succumb to being a cheating bitch.
---
Its possible he was wearing assassin's gear and thus gets reduces damage from players.
---
yes this is the plan from that room
---
If it's a known bug, they won't ban you. There is also 4 days to contact them and explain what actually happened.
---
I've seen this several times with a moderate-level player palling around with a high lever player, trying to bait you into PvP. This game started pretty troll-free from my experience, but it's getting worse as time goes on. 
---
Yeah I had an issue a few weeks back where when I moved mine I would have a weird amount of certain items.  Like 6 nuka cola machines, 100+ corn, 3 water purifiers and so on.  I would notice when my budget was maxed and just had to go through and delete all the extra ones.
---
Console patch isn't out, and they only patched ways to exploit so far.
---
Also, it was supposedly tweaked a bit to put all the letters to need to spell "typewriter" in the top row, as a sales gimmick. Or so I've heard.
---
We need to be able to trade gold perk cards. I got two in one pack. Had never noticed they were special until then
---
Yes 😔
---
holy cow. you are right.  i just removed the class freak card (reduced negative effects from mutations)   and i went up in armor.    heartbreaking ;\_;     well at least now i can be sure the perks are worthless and slot something else.   that was a tremendous help, thank you.
---
Finally they're taking action
---
Oh BS. I have a lvl 100+ and a lvl 45 and I’ve never seen a TSE drop. 
---
Dudes making bank and exposing the shitty game industry for a living. Sound pretty jeleous .
---
I'm glad that at least some are getting punished but that's not the reaction most have. Most have already duped to their hearts content and quit the game due to boredom. Nevertheless, fuck'em.
---
Unless they changed something in-game, I'm guessing that RNGsus was on your side. I broke down a few armour pieces today and got nothing.
---
Right. Why is there only a few reports of this, when everyone was acting like there was at least one duper per server. This doesn't mean anything. For all we know this account was broadcasting to the world how to dupe and his username.
---
I'm theory... We could then build war camps, full of armor and turrets, and declare war on the camp next door.....I'm in
---
&gt; The story is we came out of a vault and are piecing together wtf happened to everyone. 
---
That's not a story, that is a premise.  You are listening to someone else's story to fill in backstory for the world, that is lore.
---
Thank you for confirming! I just changed my build last night from PA to non-PA, and I definitely felt squishier than I should have been with the barbarian perk. Looks like another bug!
---
Having picked up 1 tse, 3 2shots, and 3 explosive without any serious farming I can believe that
---
So, youtubers think they're the only people in the universe, gotcha. 
---
Laughing that this comment is downvoted. 
---
Most of the people here will agree with you. I love the game and if you see how it has improved over the past 2 months, it's a great sign.
---
Yes it is buggy. I personally think they should have started BETA way sooner since this was their first online game and done it 24/7 to flush out more problems, but that's all in the past. It can only get better from here and I can't wait to see what new content comes out once they get the game stable enough to do some DLCs
---
Hopefully this will deter people from duping so I can actually play more than an hour without getting disconnected. Easily the most frustrating thing about this game is the constant disconnects.
---
That's where my camp is, it's getting tough having it load in though as is becoming prime retail estate.  Once I saw 3 camps all along the cliff,  almost felt like a fancy neighbourhood.  
---
Somebody started the drinking game
---
It's literally a story. You're using your opinion to make your own definitions. I have personally really enjoyed the story and piecing together the lives of these people. 
---
Ad hominem. Your previous posts, and this one includes a lot of  attacks towards me as a person and my ethos, rather than just sticking to a logos argument. I am fully able to reflect and fully within my rights to rationalize when i disagree with your assessments. But I havent questioned you as a person. That rhetorical strategy solely lies with you.
---
Mine is just the main building(s) with everything attached to it. Turrets, stash etc. Frustrating to have to dismantle everything and scrap all the duped parts, just to be under the budget again.
---
Have  1 tse, 3 2shots, and 3 explosive, luck 5, 159 hours  
---
Combat armor has a helmet that will match the style.
---
I keep a cop hat, patrol glasses, and slave collar on, it matches my outfit pretty well
---
Doesn’t work. It looses the paint as soon as you drop it
---
It may take a few years, but people eventually get bored of hating on a game.
---
I didnt agree to anything I am not a lawyer able to navigate through that bullshit and at no point do I put pen to paper suggesting I did.  The fact is they didnt crack some deep sunken code they actually did something that was perfectly acceptable in the game that happened to cause unintended side affects.  They paid for the game they should be allowed to play it end of story.  Release a single player patch and they can never go online again whatever but saying the 60 dollars they spent is now gone because of some bullshit bethesda knew about and didnt fix is fucking wrong.
---
Sure and you can change server or block em. That's solved for ya.
---
My bounty was not accidental.  I took out the turrets of a base that some inconsiderate person put up at Whitesprings.
---
We could trade
---
I assume it is a known bug, as most people have this happen to them a lot.
---
Disconnects for me have been about the same rate as pre-patch. Certainly nowhere near as bad as 5 an hour.
---
76 is above Atlas because Joe didnt expect a triple A developer to pull a Unity style asset flip. Bethesda should have more money and more sense for that shit. 
---
Same story as far as I know
---
Yeah, that's broken. You shouldn't be completely impervious to any type of attack. Thanks for letting me know though, hopefully myself and the rest of the TSE community can bring this invincibility to Bethesda's attention and get it fixed.
---
Yep, saw that too.  if you use the bumpers to jump intervals at a time it still stops at 0 but the triggers yeah just keep wrapping around.
---
Don't you know this sub is only for ~~randsom demands~~ requests? You're not actually supposed to give any credit to the company that made, and is continuously improving, the game we're all enjoying. /s
---
Basically you are doing the same as those people, who you find hilarious.
---
why aren't the patch notes posted directly to here?
---
the Bethesda website is ass that doesn't work. 
---
&gt; It's literally a story. You're using your opinion to make your own definitions. I have personally really enjoyed the story and piecing together the lives of these people.
---
No I'm not.  A story requires plot.  Listening to the holotapes is you listening to someone else's story, you don't even have to get them in order and there is no consequence to doing the main quest either way because you aren't a part of the Overseer's story.
---
Im still on my level 35 Gauss (am level 55) because I haven't found another or a plan. 😣
---
Yep.  Fortunately they are able to tell difference in using an exploit and just a game glitch that does this.
---
Or pay homage to its older counterparts that had a 100% Crit chance and give it *exceptional* critical damage for use in VATS heavy builds.
---
I mean, in the end he broke the ToS which is a ban. It sucks, but we all agreed to it when we purchased the game and made an account. I doubt even 1/100th of the community has duped.  It's an issue that has been brought into the light, but you have to remember that those of us on reddit are a HUGE minority compared to people who actually play the game and reddit is a big echo chamber.
---
This made my morning, thank you.
---
Hey man whatever makes you feel like a big boy where it matters the least
---
:)
---
I was able to get a selfie with one a couple weeks ago.
---
When mining resources I believe you get double, but that's just from having the arms. The full set gives you 100 carry weight. 
---
What's the TSE community lol
---
No they are comparing blaming exploiters on Bethesda is logically similar to blaming robberies on someone who didn’t take all actions available to secure their home.   
---
**They are comparing blaming to blaming**, not exploiting to robberies; but you know that. It just doesn’t fit your agenda, so you decide to knowingly misinterpret it so it does fit your agenda. 
---
Exactly. ESO had a pretty terrible launch too, but now it is one of the best MMOs out there
---
Because hes suggesting 20 other people were crouched the entire time
---
If you can’t understand that it’s wrong to try to shift the blame from someone who abuses exploits to the game they are in, you deserve the downvotes. Try and reflect on why that is wrong. And no, I’m not gonna help you, this is a you problem.
---
"Thanks for doing your job, better late than never" Never heard of anyone saying that without being sarcastic.
---
Ah good, i didn't know if the game sends code out about items getting duped. A bit different to the bs the dupers use, but didn't know. Glad it is getring sorted though the duping, as it has become somewhat of a joke.
---
I'm not quite that high but I am at ~1,100 and I've just gotten used to the penalties for being overweight. Honestly it kind of nice not fast traveling, I'm forced to traverse the wasteland and see the world that Bethesda has created. And the AP penalty/no sprinting just adds a new layer of difficulty to combat.
---
They are trying to dupe them ultricite bullets and stable flux  and nukacolas probably 
---
If it is that's stupid 
---
has 200lbs of junk... only 15 ballistic fiber
---
Although i did see two vendors carrying it yesterday, so im betting it was changed a bit
---
When I have a shitty day at work I help people who are lower levels &amp; leave them things in their bags when they die. It makes up for the jerk players who destroy other people's stuff.
---
explosive affix legendary weapons are supposed to be being nerfed and probably no longer be affected by demo expert
---
The lowest you'll be able to find is Raider power armor, that goes as low as level 15.  There are some spawns in the Forest, but anywhere else and you start to see a bigger level gap.
---
Raider power armor starts at level 15, and there is USUALLY a full or nearly full set locked in a truck trailer at gorge junkyard north of the overseer's camp. It takes a level 3 lockpick to get to it.
---
Beth ban this dude. Using duped mats just as guilty. Bet you wont cucks
---

Was it really that many?  If we assume just 2mins per hop that's over 36 hours continuous playing.  You have the patience of a saint. 
---
No I don't want every single mod, I just wanted the T-60 Jet Pack. After literal hundreds of attempts, I just started to buy every T-60 plan I didn't have whether I wanted it or not to at least have something worthwhile if I fail in the end.
---
Nah, there is no reason to be jeleous to these "dudes". I have no interest in their business and as we see, they are pretty easy to corrupt. Only thing that they expose is that they can be bought.
---
Yeah, but don't worry about it brah, I don't grind really but I'll just drop by some of these suggested stations when I'm on and it will turn up.  Thanks for the offer, see you in the wastes!
---
Its an apocalypse game, what would you do? Make a nice house, TV, console, bed, gear up, kill threats. Seems complete to me
---
Yes they shoulde't of been banned... Without further context of what this duper actually did, like crashing the servers or generally ust helping people out even, bethesda should not be allowed to perm ban someone especially when they spent their own money on the game. It's silly... It's just a game.
---
Wasn't it in the notes, doubt it.
---
very very weird
---
Maybe even server wide events where there's one or two really nice items hidden in a small-ish area. So every gets the quest notification and have to try and get this item before anyone else does.
---
 I'd imagine having PVP auto enabled in the area would really spice up things, and satisfy those of us who want more fleshed out PVP. 
---
With 2 shot explosives, you are also getting aoe. That adds up quickly
---
Well said couldn't agree more if they didn't care they wouldn't be listening to all the complaints and fixing most of them. 
---
I at level 65 and I know there were a couple there lower than I was and the closest level to me was 40ish away. I have to admit, with all the lagging, and problems this game has it is fun as shit with meeting and playing with people.
---
See you in the World.
---
Already doing that - but would like a more permanent solution too.
---
I still don't like ESO much because it's not really Elder Scrolls, but this is actually feels like Fallout
---
Fallout 76 has a lot of subtle features missing, in the name of lag, that were seen in previous games. Ive noticed that limbs no-longer dismember, you can not move world objects with the player view and 99% of dropped items deploy in the worldspace as a paperbag container.
---
This is not cosmetic but these features, for the amount of capacity they use, are not really worth including.
---
I've also noticed that unlike the other fallout games, the ways the worldspace and enemies render is very different, besides the fact the worldspace now contains more LOD data (short medium and long distance layers for in-game scenery). I really admire how bethesda has made such a high density worldspace, so much larger than previous, still running smooth with 30 people. Just remember all the times fallout 3 and new vegas used to crash and remember fo76's world is like 4 times bigger with 30x more people.
---
Fallout has recently had an influx of players who have been exploiting the game by deliberately over-working the connected server via client, crashing the server, to duplicate items. This kind of pathetic behaviour that boots 29 people of a crashed server so one player can cheat, would only be more possible with features like naming weapons.
---
Flamingo.... I have no idea what a Armingo is.
---
We not only have to test the game for them and list the bugs for them but also be there bosses: "Thanks for doing YOUR JOB"
---
Pre patch or post patch
---
&gt;quick on/off switch.
---
thats one of the biggest ways to exploit the system, they should just enable pvp 24/7 for people that want it... on character creation.. .boom done, if they wanna pvp they should pvp the way it was meant to be, none of this switch/slap damage bullshit. 
---
A few discords, Facebook groups, and reddit chats of TSE users. 
---
If it was single player then sure exploit away.  Since it's not though it's obvious exploits aren't allowed.
---
thanks, any idea where?
---
Yeah it's called an offline game.
---
Hell yes! And then next the most egregious seller of them all, the Atom store.
---
any ideas how soon you can get lockpick 3?
---
I remember and you also had to do a lot more damage before you got the experience it wasn’t a one shot tag
---
What platform are you on? 
---
No, suggesting that there were others just maybe not 20. 
---
But if you believe something (the game is a disaster) then that is all you see and believe no matter the contradictory evidence. 
---
Could other people have been there? Yes
---
20? Most likely not.  
---
Army of mingos
---
Red herring.
---
None of this is restoring your hazmat suit to the desired function. You're changing the subject to respond as a victim because you think it offers you leverage by appealing to some rights of Reddit.
---
Play the game. Mitigate the rad damage.
---
Now if we can only get you to stop commenting it would be a win for everybody. 
---
In what way were they griefing you?  Kept taking your workshops?  Or kept doing slap damage?  if the former there is nothing to be done,  if the latter then they are harming themselves more with repair costs,  though I guess you may have had to eat something to heal. 
---
Excellent patch additions! But I still think that a weapon status bar (for the damage the weapon has) could be implemented oh and also an option the keep the food and thirst bars always on!
---
Yeah it really was! I had a notepad to record everything, I even wrote down how long each hop was taking and got the same average you got at 2 minutes. When I passed 400 I began to realize how much time I've lost and started buying any rare T-60 mod I could find to try to salvage my time.
---
I grab at least two workshops every time I play to get plans.
---
So since launch - like easily 50+ workshop claims.
---
I have been attacked exactly once. Two days ago to be precise at Abandoned Bog Town.  I was oneshot by someone with an explosive weapon.
---
All other times it was a PvE experience (defend vs mobs).
---
So from my experience - very little would change.
---
looks good but may want to change gunsmith/high intelligence for something else since with weapon artisan guns last a fairly long time without the need of repairs
---

---
Totally agree with you on this. 
---
I can just imagine your character just bitching to themselves while putting it together, then you go "oh wait that wall doesn't go over there."
---
Whatever your reasons, you ventured into PvP.  Its not worth it IMO - just ignore those people and let them be.  A true Pacifist would do just that.  The whole problem with PvP is that it allows people to impose on others...  even if I'm not crazy about those bases, I'm not cool with people that try to impose on others.
---
So for you cynical entitled ingrates implying that I am some kind of kissass.
---
Yup. You betcha. 
---
I am as much of a fanboy cocksucker as you are a pusillanimous twit. 
---
Yes. It is better to do the job right the first time. But the situation is what it is and there is nothing wrong giving credit where credit is due. The most recent changelog is proof that a good portion of what is wrong is getting communicated back to those able to do something about it.
---
I will continue to suck that dick and swallow as long as it gets results.
---
Did this patch not fix duping?
---
Its not stupid from a business standpoint. If you could trade painted pieces, very few people would pay Atoms for them
---
Yup. TSE and any explosive damage type weapon is useless in PvP now. For TSE, this is great. For those of us who don’t use cheesy TSE and just like missile launchers, what the fuck Bethesda?
---
The best plan for workshops I could come with is to only use them for some easy X2, maybe a plan and some “stuff”, but only if I really need what the workshop offers.  Lock everything up tight, which means getting VERY creative in physically blocking access the the workshop proper with offset floors and a lot of walls and roofs so that you can’t get to the workshop machine to take it, you can only get wanted destroying something to get to it.  I see waaaaay back from the workshop, or fast travel and do other stuff, u til it gets attacked, then I travel back and see if it is a schedule defense event, or someone wants it.  If someone does want it, I just let them have it,  knowing they will get wanted before they can get to it.  However if you show up for a defend event and accept my invitation to team for the event, then when it is done, and I get the scrap/resources I need off the resource collectors, I will give you the workshop intact.  So far I have only had 1 or 2 folks who did not join me, and they both became wanted trying to get to the workshop contest zone.  Much fun this is to sit back and watch...
---
That being said, abusing a glitch is abusing a glitch regardless, sucks that you decided to use the glitch to negate the carry weight hopefully you didnt take it a step further and carry 100k items and cause instability. I'd like to see them ban people that have anything over 10k in their inventory (aside from ammo)
---
And hundreds of thousands of bobbleheads, since that wasn't fixed yet either
---
I see you ignored my response back to you and you're now trying to call out others. Why dont you stop bitching and get off reddit and go farm like we have and maybe you'll get a fancy 30% ghoul slayers gamma gun.
---
I’m sorry but I read this often and it simply isn’t an argument. I haven’t used any “phantom weight” to make the game playable. I’ve adjusted my gaming habits in line with the new system.  Anyone using the exploits to  “make the game playable” are cheating, and blaming the game for their lack of will power. 
---
&gt;Omg... you think that the .45 ammo that used for a combat rifle in the game isn't the same ammo that is also used in the upgraded .45 pipe rifle...?
---
...
---
There are no bullets. It's a game. It's pretend.
---
There are no bullets.
---
-_-
---
Sounds like more of a problem with an overpowered legendary affix than pvp interactions.
---
On PC. The patch will be released on next monday for consoles.
---
Lockpick 3 starts showing up in the late 30's early 40's I believe.
---
Well, I would think, at least hope, that it is also easy to look up the character database and search for characters who has item id's with a higher quantity than what is to be expected.
---
Slap damage mostly, although eventually they started taking my workshops and that's when I left.
---
I'll take #3 please make every 5 Dupes turn into a card pack!
---
They could just use the in game achievement system to track this too.
---
They just have to give us a choice because some of us want to have 1 2 and 3 star variants of cars available for builds.
---
I somehow doubt that they envisioned all the mass d-bags running around with infinite ammo, duped uber weapons, and unintendedly synergizing perks with a friend o r alt account to hold their caps while they farm rando's for hours.
---
If you can just give your caps to another account, you lose nothing at pvp and you can just spray your TSE auto shotty forever and lose nothing.  
---
Me, on the other hand, lose 125 caps everytime I die so pvp is a non-starter as I don't have another account to 'hold' all my risks and consequences for me.
---
This is why pvp isn't a viable model right now.
---
Not all online games need to be Fortnite, there's plenty to be said for online team based PvE.
---
Someone else mentioned the Gorge Junkyard set, and I am racking my brain to think of another spot but coming up empty.
---
Nuke, kill the queen, bitch that you got another explosive vent, rinse, repeat.
---
Or at least that’s what I’m doing
---
Vaders voice: "Most impressive"
---
I saw a goggle doc of all the camp files in the game awhile ago (helped me get camp plans a lot) and Mounted heads for everything were showed in the list. I’m sure we’ll get them at some point :)

they should be exiled to morrowind instead.
---
either the cliff racers get them, or they wipe out the cliff racers.
---
either way everyone wins. 
---
You need to get class freak in the luck section if you don't have it. That chem debuff also affects stim packs, radaway, and rad x
---
I guess i was lucky in getting my X-01 jetpack in 6 hours on PC then huh?
---
Wow had no idea that TSE can be a community, ROFL
---
Hooray! I was about to ask them to give us a perk that intimidated enemies when we bash the air. Fixing this is better though lol.
---
Spoiled meat still gives me diseases but raw meat does not. All meat still gives radiation that is not a part of the perk. The meat is double effective when eating to satisfy hunger. I love the perk, I try to stock up on iodonized meat when farming nuke zones. It is light weight and never spoils. The rad penalty is nothing 
---
Pacifist stops you from being able to hurt others by mistake.
---
It does not stop them from being able to hurt you, albeit with a damage reduction.   This sounds good on paper, but in practice if you stack buffs and have the right weapons you can be one-shot dead even with Pacifist mode turned on.
---
Perhaps this would not be such a problem if the game hadn't had multiple duping exploits.  But it did, and the kind of people that like to camp and grief are the ones who seem to all have the same legendary explosive weapons.
---
Watch your map for someone to take the junkyard and go see if they are high level and ask them. I had a dude do that for me when I was like 20-25, I asked him if he could open the door and if I could have the level 15 armor in there and he did.
---
Don't knowingly exploit bugs.  
---
It's not rocket science. No need for a wall of text.
---
Very true. ESO is an action MMO set in the Elder Scrolls world, not an Elder Scrolls game
---
What system are you on?
---
SO, I have been playing for a good while on the game, level 89 nothing insane. I got alot of notes and holo tapes and 580ish in my box and 300 on my person. I disconnected alot. As a test I made a new character went onto the same server, didn't disconnect once. I also then loaded the level 2 down, no disconnects. I then loaded its box down and the character full up box and 4000 pounds of random stuff...no disconnects.  
---
I'd like to theorize that the longer your character has played the worse the disconnects. I was with a group of 2 others and kept going back to the same server and they would crash I wouldn't on the new character. The server did eventually shut down entirely but I wonder if the code and server has issues with older characters. I'm not coding smart but I would think there would be a ID difference? 
---
I read your post and flat out do not believe you. Flat out.
---
than\* -.-
---
Share that with the perk in the strength tree which reduces junk wait by 90% and you're good to go.
---
Thank you! Ive been saying this for the past month
---
I do the same, play in 3rd with my Gatling as the Gatling reticle doesn't work in 1st person, but quickly swap to 1st if I'm inside a building or have ghouls in my face.
---
Lol
---
Do the Neon Letters still only light up if they are blue?

*Second online game*
---
There's a garage near Morgantown that sometimes has a set.  
---
Morgantown train yard and airport, and do the event collision coarse 
---
There is a big difference between voicing a valid complaint and wanting to be heard and going for personal attacks..
---
I disagreed with many of the OP's point, and as for having low standards...  
---
Not really, I've been told I have unrealistic standards in the past, but being a MOD author has given me some fresh perspective, and it's hard to avoid being a hypocrite without first recognizing some of the mistakes I've made on a micro scale and applying it to the macro.
---
Pardon the sports analogy, It's super easy to armchair quarterback, and I've been vey very guilty of it in the past... But once you're on the sidelines, looking from that perspective, it can and will change things....   
---
If I come acrossed as an apologist it's because I know how hard it can be to keep up with a small to medium sized mod, with a few tens of thousands of downloaders, and how easy it is to miss a typo here and a mistake there when editing a couple hundred thousand entries. Even a "quick fix" can often take longer as you try to fix one more thing and that change has unforeseen consequences. 
---
As for swimming through money, Scrooge McDuck style, to get to their desks, we'd need to see their books, and I'm not invested enough to dig that deep, but generally I've found things often cost more than we realize.
---
Don’t forget to pick up power patcher and fix it good!
---
The solution to workshops for a PvE server is to just make those zones open PvP, similar to contested areas in WoW.
---
Even if you are not flagged, if you go into an enemy city in WoW you are auto-flagged PvP and it persists for 5 minutes after you leave the zone.
---
You're not very good at comprehending what you read.  
---
They're not comparing cheating to robbing. They're saying that not locking your house doesn't mean anyone is free to rob you, just like not having fixed an exploit doesn't mean anyone is free to exploit it.  
---
It's not rocket science and almost as easy as copypasting replies around the thread.
---
It's actually not that bad, A lot of your reason for fast travelling back and forth gets negated by having what you need on your person at all times, the weapons, armor, ammo, and other stuff you hop around to repair, replace, and scavenge are all there, no worries, no problems. There are some downsides, but honestly aside from some minor event related issues there isn't a real need to jump all over the map all the time unless you want there to be.
---
&gt;"Thanks for doing YOUR JOB"
---
Exactly! When people do their job, you thank them, so as to motivate them to continue to do so. It costs nothing to be polite, and the dividends can be immense. :) 
---
I mean, how sad can someone be to be praising a patch that fixed a reload animation instead of game breaking AI and Enemy animations and broken mechanics and perks. Jesus people, it's time to stop.
---
I can't be cheating if I haven't played in a month lol. When Bethesda sends my money back I would leave. That's kind of the point. I paid for it, I should be able to comment. Right?
---
Don't hate us because we aren't fanboi's
---
Yea, no way am I posting the persons gamertag. 
---
LOL these problems can easily be solved with a can of whoopass. Open one.
---
Are the recent bannings enough of an inkling?
---
Uh, you have no proof that it's fake either, so stop reporting people.
---
Oh wow, I just checked lol
---
True aluminium is more common but still run out
---
Only takes one duper to crash a server. 1 out of 24 people per server.  Or you saying that almost everyone in FO76 is a exploiter? Or are you projecting what you do onto everyone else?
---
Could be, and very likely. But Bethesda's shenanigans are unfortunately real.
---
I think the people carrying thousands of pounds are the same people that dupe. There's a mile of difference between I want to carry my normal gear that normally only weighs 135 collectively and I want to carry hundreds of every item. I can't speak for others by I had over 300 in phantom weight at one point. To me that's unplayable given the gameplay mechanics
---
Doesn’t pacifist enabled deaths, make the other, wanted more?
---
I get that you can pvp with pacifist on or off, but if you didn’t start it wouldn’t 
---
That raise caps cost?
---
Regardless I get the death is still the same, but I wonder if your junk loss or mats are different then
---
Say, you initiate fight and die vs you’re the victim.
---
Not a fan of pvp I think it’s a waste of my time &amp; gaming experience.
---
I think that's a good idea.  I was killed launch day by a lvl 12 as I hit lvl 6 when I had no idea about PvP or any real time in the game.  I'd love to meet that arsewipe again now.   I'd take great delight in blowing their head off and destroying every last stick of their C.A.M.P. over and over. It would be worth every CAP.
---
Does this mean that, if for some reason, I have tonnes of wood and leather, and i decide to craft boards just solely for the XP part, I can get banned, and I have to explain to Bethesda why I did it? Isn't that a very inaccurate way...
---
By my estimate I would say you have about a 0.75% chance to receive a true quality drop from Legendary enemies, I have left a blast zone with over 30 Legendary items several times with all of them being crappy 1* armor, most often the wooden armor, I have also been trying to build a full set of Heavy Metal or Combat 3* armor for a while but to date only have a couple pieces each, so there is obviously a luck factor in the equation but you can't get the stuff from level 1 Ghouls  in Flatwoods.
---
Lets say you wasted money on a game just trying to have fun by duping, without crashing the servers or anything like that or being nasty or rude to anybody. Suddenly you get banned just for enjoying the game? 60 dollars down the drain. Im not shifting the blame to the game entireley, it's a bit of both sides fault. You can continue hating, but it's just a game. That you spend 60 dollars on. Nobody deserves a perm ban. I get it's against the rules and all, but jesus christ a refund atleast? More hate will surround around Bethesda if they got such a rep of banning their players. In the past fallout games you could dupe without worrying about anything.
---
I paid for it, so why can't I comment? Is Bethesda paying you to be a fanboi?
---
Banning the duper’s means all their items will get lost and help restore balance to the economy 
---
As great of an idea it is, I see two potential issues:
---
Most people who have large amounts of stuff create different characters called Mules. They basically just sit in one spot, and somebody will act as a middleman so you can retrieve things off it. A lot of people would care less if they die or are immobile
---
Dupers often dupe explosive bobbleheads and strength bobbleheads. There is a glitch in the game currently that allows you to stack bobbles and keep them forever, and would have tens of thousands of points of damage and carry weight. 
---
Maybe they (if they actually implement this well) create a very small cap (3 or 2) on how many characters you can have.
---
there are already limits inbuilt to dissuade you from exceeding certain limits, the thing is that cheaters are going to cheat around them, no matter how restrictive you make something the people with ill intent will get around it, and only those who play by the rules will end up suffering
---
Yeah, full-scale pvp actually sounds fun.    I wouldn't wanna do it all the time, but it certainly would appeal to a lot of people - and it could make endgame more interesting.
---
And then Capitalism since that's what forces them to have the atom shop to pay for the servers.....and make compromises, release a game ahead of scheduled... with minimal testing... and to cut staff to increase profits... to increase the value of the company... because if you don't you'll get fired.. since that's how literally every business runs.. Fundamentally how most of human society works currently....
---
you really have no understanding of economics do you?
---
I usually have a run through there picking them up but I still seem to not have enough
---
I'd suggest reaching out to one of the community managers with a ticket number and seeing if they can't assist, maybe tagging one of the known Actors here in this subreddit, or trolling Google for a phone number for Zenamax (spelling) 
---
Might have to add it to my junk run always need more aluminium
---
If it was quantity based and not weight based it would be better. But put a max stack size on things as well. Something like 9999 max stack ammo, 99 chems, 99 bobby pins, etc. 
---
Im on ps4 but thanks for offering
---
One disconnect and 5 CTDs last night.  The disconnect is "normal" but the CTDs are new for me.
---
Yeah thats the only "solution" i've figured so far.
---
You need the caps from four characters to get top end gear?!? That's either a huge exaggeration or you are terrible at negotiating...
---
I mean, I guess. If that's what you choose to do with your time.. it's a little sad but it's your time after all. Dismissing people that disagree with you as "fanbois" just makes you smaller and more impotent than you already are. 
---
First off this is referring to when phantom weight was an actual issue related to picking up grenades off super mutants, it wasn't hard to end up with 200+ of carry weight when your inventory is emptied out. There was nothing to adjust to until they had it fixed which they did now there's no carry weight glitch and the only real reason for an average player to use it vanished too
---
Mr Cutter, you are the hero the Wasteland needs! Thanks for taking the time to reply!
---
This happened to me three different times yesterday.
---
I dunno how I feel about bein a cop lol
---
Sorry that you got triggered.
---
You still can get duplicate cards from card packs, but after you have all ranks of that specific card all other duplicates just disappear.
---
Go to the prison and get close to the main entrance to trigger it.
---
If I were in your position, it would come down to simple math for me. "Having to hop servers, reclaim these workshops and set up again will take a certain amount of time and effort, and this will cost me X amount of fun. But having to deal with these lowlives on this server will cost me four times X amount of fun. Hopping servers is the better deal." 
---
IDK, wire shark is not in the same league as cheat engine, as it was designed primarily for tech support reasons, and well cheat engine has non-exploitive uses, but it's not it's original purpose..  
---
Perhaps they expected Bethesda actually fixing their game.
---
Yay!
---
Phew, that's a relief! I'm glad I'm not the only one! Turns out that's what it's meant to be.
---
I stand by my original statement that there is a lack of viable alternatives to the hazmat suit, which was, in my experience, the only viable alternative even though it was still miles behind PA. Even in my original post I agreed that the change made sense. It was simply a discussion about alternatives. I never called for it to be restored.
---
As for the rhetorical observations. It's not a red herring. It's simply stating the obvious fact that you continue to attack me as a person rather than just having a discussion. 
---
They're only blue
---
You do realize that this is not the norm. I've never heard of an MMO not being cross-platform.
---
Honestly they should get banned, they crash servers and ruin good honest peoples games, they are the definition of selfish 
---
Cool story kid.
---
Not sure either trade or workshops
---
They posted videos on youtube that showed their gamertags
---
Don't know Pokemon, but it sounds plausible 
---
Lmao. Ok but, playing through a story based around your character is also "listening to someone else's story". Or did you magically get transported into the world when you played other games? It sounds like you wanted it to be another typical Fallout game when they were extremely clear that it wasn't. Doesn't matter what you say, I like the story. I'm sorry you didn't. 
---
No he's right you're a troll. Or a tool. Or both. 
---
Alright hopefully it's not tied to a level cap, I've heard it's only available between 30-39 from vendor's and my character is level 50
---
&gt; A true Pacifist would do just that.
---
Yea, I am not a one of those.  Some level 80 dick was luring the ghouls out, and away from the levels 40's who were trying to level, and then attacking them if they got close to his base.  I knew what I was doing, and then made a joke post with a funny picture about how hard it was to convince people to kill me to take my bounty away.  
---
It gets views.  Plain and simple.
---
The hate boner for this game is strong.  Especially among those that have never played it.
---
The "community" has plenty of it's own boneheaded dumbassery too. This isn't even the first time fake ban crap has been posted and shared
---
&gt; No witchhunting. Do not ask users to go after other players in game and  do not accuse players of cheating. 
---
reading your comment made me want to drop a post, but then i read the side bar and im pretty sure that falls under "No witchhunting"
---
Stock up on Acid using the bulking exploit, if you foresee ever needing to use it. I needed it to convert Black Titanium ore to scrap.
---
I don't care what Todd thinks.  This game is proof that he's clearly out of sync with the playerbase on many things.
---
Considering each map only holds 24-28 people, splitting the playerbase is literally not an issue - at all.
---
How close are we talking?
---
I mean one would think weaponry works better at close range but that is not always the case.
---
Heavy weapons are much, much better at range. Swapping to a automatic rifle or pistol can greatly help when dealing with things swarming close. Or since you're a heavy, just get the super sledge from Mayor for a day and bonk the enemies that are close and switch back to your .50 cal when their cleared.
---
It lowers it enough that no one should be using vats with a two shot gun, ever 
---
ESO is not run by Bethesda.  Its Zenimax 
---
What story
---
Be very careful about this. Now that they are banning dupers it would be very easy for them to report you after you steal their shit. Then you would be banned unfairly. Ditch that duped shit right away for your own sake. 
---
&gt; Lmao. Ok but, playing through a story based around your character is also "listening to someone else's story". Or did you magically get transported into the world when you played other games?
---
That is literally THE ENTIRE POINT OF A ROLE PLAYING GAME.  You don't like a story, there is no story, you just have calcified buyer's remorse from everyone telling you the game sucks all the time and your mind trying to reject the criticism by making illogical conclusions.
---
5 pieced of power armor weigh way more than 10lbs unless they are on a frame, so the cheapest way for storage is to put them all on frames
---
People are unreliable 
---
It's highly recommended to have a set. If you put calibratet shocks on it, you can have +200 carry weight. You can also use it for mining, since it gives increased resources, can craft ammo fast this way. 
---
That would be a borderline impossibility seeing as how you’d have to look up each and every player then go into their inventory. With new players joining and those that no doubt walked away from the game a month ago, the sheer volume would be overwhelming. 
---
TBH-- i was using this until i discovered that it was easier to just kill them. 
---
What level are you?
---
Give me a break man. Once I died in Ultimate Online and not only lost literally everything on me, but I had my house key on me so I lost everything in my house too haha. And he killed my horse. This is literally child’s play. 
---
Haven't found that one yet, but heard about it, sounds very cool (and not looking up the location yet, still enjoying discovering things naturally)
---
Truly appreciate this! I was wondering where I could get 5 points from to use up Class Freak and Starched Genes. Makes sense to swap in Weapon Artisan for stronger repairs than having to use 5 points all the time for slower break rate. Also with the new patch requiring less materials to repair, this would be more beneficial. Thanks! Will be saving this build for sure!
---
My first login after the patch, disconnected from server.  Had some of those and CTDs as well.
---
The only improvement I'm seeing is that logging into servers or loading screens during fast travel is behaving a lot better and generally much quicker too.  So faster to recover from a disconnect and CTD, but overall stability is mostly hit or miss.  Less of that server not responding/controls locked though.
---
I found a plan yesterday at Watoga for treated marine wetsuit but it was called “marine under armor”.
---
It never came. 
---
Eh, I'm happy not being bitter and miserable. I'll just continue enjoying the game for what it is and being hopeful about future patches. You do you though. 
---
I mean it's not a bug. It's a current mechanic. When crafting it even tells you on the right side in the required materials tab that it's going to scrap your mod. Most people just spam the button and don't bother reading it
---
HELLO THERE!!
---
Two idiots, both arguing about who has the best reason for wanting the same end result...smh
---
&gt; LOL these problems can easily be solved with a can of whoopass. Open one.
---
Not interested.  That's why I play Fallout/Skyrim type games and not Call of Duty.  I am playing 76 despite it being a multiplayer game because I love the franchise - otherwise I'd skip it entirely.
---
I'm not alone in this sentiment.
---
I can tell you how it works with the vendor robots.
---
if you sell an item to a vendor and you have already 25k caps there will be a small 
---
info in the middle of the screen with something like "max caps" and your item is gone and the caps too.
---
Level 50
---
And the string holding all the pencils together broke and I had to start over!! 
---
oh ouch, my feelings, some random on the internet insulted me
---
yeh, that thing you said with the warp speed perfectly describes the issue.
---
I event went so far as to clean my mouse and mousepad to eliminate the possibility of dirt making the mouse go haywire.
---
But even when I walk up the stairs on auto walk without touching my mouse it happens. Worst thing is, that it’s not a major issue but bad enough to make you not want to play
---
&gt; they had exposed the weaknesses of the beast
---
&gt; the beast refused to acknowledge its many faults
---
&gt; the beast would silence those who would dare expose the faults if they did exist
---
&gt; the ancient ones stirred, a new era to return.
---
&gt; like the Reapers of Mass Effect their servers were finally getting the ad revenue of their former glory days.
---
&gt; CheatCC, Gamespy, Games Tracker, and Games Radar rose like a slumbering giant suddenly jarred from its sleep. 
---
&gt; The beast sought again to silence those responsible but the voices now came from behind a wall.
---
&gt; the beast plastered Cease and desists, but to no avail.
---
&gt; the old ones had returned  
---
Haha that's funny.  I had a idiot moment obviously.  Indeed the mighty Armingos 
---
Queue the pity gold...oh nvm
---
ha dont worry i wont shame you, everyone makes mistakes.
---
I don’t consider limb dmg and item naming cosmetic. It is  a capability in FO4, and from some of these responses, seems to be valid missing request.
---
Pardon my ignorance but I don’t understand how your response about lag and duping ties back to 
---
the thread of Named items..
---
Please advise
---
That is it!  Im not reddit savy enough to figure out how to post my pic.

You rolling on the floor laughing about there being a discord for TSE users
---
I'm now disappointed in him, I'd not watched him in quite a while, but when I did a couple years ago he seemed fine. Well, I sure hope he gets banned now.
---
I can sell you a set of painted power armor if you'd like, it would involve you paying me and I'd just drop you the set. If you're skeptical that's fine I understand 
---
That store is a rip off. It's like they have a monopoly or something.
---
Did you read the plans?
---
Thanks again!
---
I should blame the creator when someone shoves a piece of pointy metal in my gut or should i maybe blame the knife wielder?
---
I mean if god didn't want people to stab other people maybe he should have given us all knife-proof stomachs?
---
There is also a marine under armor as well
---
Were you wanted?
---
Also that sucks 
---
There's an issue in 3rd person where the actual reticle and the camera reticle done sync up for shit within a certain range regardless of the weapon. I've tested this out with damn near every weapon I can find. it also makes looting a hassle in that view as well. Easy way to test this is go up to a corpse in 3rd person try to loot it (a lot of times you have to be at a weird spot in relation to the body). Standing right by it and pointing the reticle at it then switch to 1st person and see where you are aimed at now usually it's off target considerably
---
I mean if they have to be that in the open about it then it won't really make that much of a difference.
---
Gotcha, still don't have confirmation of this yet though, correct? Thanks
---
[It's not the same location as mine, is it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a91emn/you_know_somethin_utivich_i_think_this_just_might/)
---
Started happening to me after yesterday's PC patch, almost never before that. It's either the new anti-dupe measures misbehaving or dupers just logging back into the game and breaking someone else on the server.
---
Sry u dont know what your doing either lol. It takes us about 8 mins per silo and 5 of those are the end waiting on bots it doesnt take long if u know where everythings at like the cores, plus they patched that other stuff long ago. Just another who assumes the worst cause they cant do something someone else can lol.
---
Glad you like it the idea was inspired by a Japanese animation called Full Metal Alchemist where the younger brother's soul is trapped in a suit of armour.
---
You need "energy" to propel the "ballistic" round, its fundamentally how gauss rifles work in both fiction and non fiction.  Its also known as a [Coil Gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coilgun) in non fiction. They introduce this bug by basing the weapon type on its ammo. which for 99% of the game probably isnt an issue. 
---
Why not just craft a few dozen of them really quick? Takes 30 seconds 
---
Can't think with logic on this one man, they're running a business strategy which generally runs in the face of that stuff when it comes to issues like these.
---
Yeah, amazing, isn't it ? Is there an ivory hilt mod community too ?
---
Do you guys really still want to picture Bethesda as the good guys?
---
South of the crashed plane site, there is a small one that I built on.

Just checked, the one at Berkeley Springs is ornamental and cannot be picked up.

shoudnt be an issue after the fix the weapon type to use rifle perks.

These Beth praise posts always seem like some marketer mock up caption. I mean he game is alright, but cmon now no need for a "i love you beth" thread every hour just to try and get a pity gold.
---
In liberty prime voice: DUPING IS NO ALTERNATIVE FOR DEMOCRACY
---
Well the wetsuit is under armor so it’s quite possible that the marine under armor mod would work.
---
I had this happen when I put out the foundations for building my house and then put up a few walls. Then I decided to move a few of the foundations but wasn't able to. Then I moved my whole camp to the same spot to get rid of everything so I could start fresh. That's when I got duplicates and the water purifier taking up budget you couldn't scrap.
---
For me the worst bug is that if you put a wall on a foundation and store that wall you can never move that foundation as it is locked in place by the stored wall. That's what drove me to wasting something like 120 caps and getting half an hours time of scrapping, ending up with a lot of scrap I just left in a bag and logged off since my stash was full and my camp was built.
---
Fallout 76 has very limited PvP... It's hardly there TBH... 
---
But whatever I guess special snowflakes like you is what makes greifers happy... Hell I've only chatted with you 5mn and I want to wreck your CAMP.
---
I go by xXxV@p3G0d69XxX
---
That's not much stuff for duper, just by taking every single junk you see you can easily reach that.
---
I went to Raleigh's to see if there were more motors and no. That's probably the best way to fix it, to always spawn a few motors at that location. 
---
Why the hell are you carrying around that much stuff man?
---
Click on mining nodes:) (the ones resource generators go on)  
---
Cslibrated shocks are sold by sole vendors.. Probably easier to find someone selling and buy them.. (I do sell one, not biased at all:p)
---
Killing yourself does not work, nor does dying to a creature.
---
Not anymore bro :)

Probably why no one was on the server, lol. It was having the issues. You just luckily were able to stay on it, lol.

They seem trustworthy, what with all the multiple bannings and admitted duping.
---
Give in, embrace the weight, mold yourself around it, find enlightenment in travelling the slow winding roads of peace and tranquility...
---
Posted this in another thread before, but it works here as well​
---
​
---
6. Ge a set of excavator armor, yeah the 100 carry weight is awesome, but even when you have calibrated shocks for other armor keep it on you so you can harvest 4x from resource nodes in the world, ores are not junk, and don't drop when you die, so keeping 800 lead ore on you and only converting as you need can save a lot of hassle down the road, trust me. Also keep ore supplies of lead, iron, gold, and nuclear, the first two because you need them in large amounts and the latter two because they can really help in a pinch.
---
8. Make use of the option having more gives you. I carry a lot of weapons. I got more hammers than most people have weapons, and can out last and outshoot a whole horde without any sort of worry about weapons breaking. Make use of your ability to leverage your supplies to spend huge lengths of time on exploration missions without having to stop for repairs constantly, I can loop around the whole map, visit every vendor, workshop, and still have working weapons when I get back to my base.
---
 Give in, embrace the weight, mold yourself around it, find enlightenment in travelling the slow winding roads of peace and tranquility, then bludgeon everything you see to death with your overstuffed backpack.
---
I agree. Although i never exploited in the game ,the duppers gave me what bethesda couldn't : some fun ! I have over 300 hours into the game since BETA and never got a TSE weapon, calibrated shocks or even jetpack.On Christmas day i logged in and saw many people crowded in whitespring but far from golfclub and i was curios about. I went there and it was some nice guy giving all mutations ,all TSE weapons and X-01 mods.I didn't think too much and grabbed myself everything i needed.Because of that i still log in to play for a couple of hours each day.
---
pretty sure that would work, but im also sure for a couple of days/weeks we would have an exploit where holding a heated super sledge lets incisor cut armor for grenades... or something equally stupid  since the engine is prone to fun stuff like that :P
---
That’s only for people pushing content, and selling for irl money.
---
Yep. 
---
I've been playing World of Warcraft for like 13 years without forced PvP.  
---
Man I was going to post a legitimate response for you but looking at your profile it's obvious you got some kind of emotional connection to this game and take any form of criticisms personally, even from others who have obviously played more and experienced more of the game. I'm sorry you feel hurt by this but I'm gonna tell ya man it'll be ok. One day private servers will drop, mod support will happen and once again the community will fix their mess.
---
If you play on playstation I wouldn't mind buying your wares 😉
---
This is an online game. You're not gonna get what you want from this type of game. You get a basic story, and then everyone runs around and kills each other. That's how this works. 
---
No buyer's remorse here. Have hundreds of hours in the game and have enjoyed every minute. It's been really fun running around with other people. I love building various camps and messing around with perks. I'm not gonna suddenly stop enjoying a game because someone told me I'm not enjoying it. That's ridiculous. 
---
I wish there were more multi-step quest chains for rare mods/plans instead of the RNG drop/vendor insanity.
---
THAT ASS HOLE
---
Yes, but you most likely didn't pick them in your first 50 levels.
---
Very true, but also I’d like it point out it let me run thru the entire nuke process so that’s why I was hella bummed about it 
---
Equipped with military grade fingers they will finger every piece of radiated filth in the wasteland to make america great again!

You got anything better than a twelve year-old’s insult?

 Have you tried reloading the game?

Next time use pre war money to make cloth. That Will hold them walls for sure! ;)

---
Sorry officer
---
Good for you, but i've seen 5 legendary mole miners spawn in that mission quite a few times.
---
 Yes to all of this. 
---
That actually was extremely useful! Thanks a lot !
---
there needs to be an easier way to remove/apply pacifist mode. and maybe some kind of indicator on your screen to remind you? even if it's just a little tick in the corner.
---
i put on pacifist mode for nuke sites to avoid nicking anyone and getting killed by a piece of shit who knows that i hit him by accident. I then forget i have pacifist mode on. one time i was going for the ammo factory, when someone with an 800 cap bounty showed up. they didn't see me, and went for the workshop, only wearing a hazmat suit. i pull out my anti armor fatman, let off the only nuke i have on him... and nothing happens. forgot to turn off pacifist mode -___-
---
No! The world will go back to what it was, and I’ll rock I tells ya! RICH!! Mwhahahahaha!!
---
You seem like you understand nuance.
---
Yes, the SQ scream gives damage. Another post on reddit, a while back, even suggested it was explosive damage because they were hiding in a building, the screams went through the door, impacting the wall next to the player, and the player was still receiving a lot of damage.
---
This definitely I've got all the mutations except Empathy (really won the lottery there after 5 days of rerolls), &amp; class freak basically negates 75% of the bad effects. I went from something like 3 strength to 16 with it &amp; teaming up.
---
Couldn’t you just enable the mic and drop the loot at their door?
---
I had a kind person do this exact thing when I moved to savage divide. Knocked on my door when he saw me crafting, I told him to grab as much water and plants as he needed. 
---
Luckily most of experienced so far have been nice but I still get asshats.
---
Cheaters make the event "monster mash" impossible to win since they just one shot. That means I won't be able to achieve the trophy
---
You gotta let out steam after a hard day of middle school somehow, I guess.
---
There’s something strangely satisfying with carrying lower level players through a queen run. Nevermind, I just like showing off my 50 cal lol 
---
I only killed 10 people but that was like 20 years ago!!!!!
---
Patch is only on PC right now.  There will likely be future glitches.
---
I had this bug even before the patch, only way to get it normal for me was by moving my entire camp. 
---
None of the vaults are, people have managed to get inside (myself included) and they're abandoned and ruined.
---
I wouldn't complain if it wasn't limited. 
---
Like literally when they are in my face and attacking in melee. I believe all the weapon have this problem when you aim in 3rd person I'm mean. I despise melee but yeah hitting them with All Rise is a good solution too.
---
Heres the thing, I do t think people need fine print in a TOS to know that if u cheat or exploit in an online multiplayer game that you will prob get banned. Seems kinda commen sense clause in my opinion 
---
At least i won't be rifle butting in the distance while mutants light my ass up
---
&gt;power armor light has been brighter

I can finally see more than two feet ahead of me in a power armor designed to excavate underground, in darkness.

Do you think that this is the right approach of a large company to a client who pays money, gets problems because of the imperfection of your algorithms and asking for a little respect in return?

Wait a second, so that's what I saw a week a go? I was in Herper's Ferry and suddently this thing fall from the skies, couldn't open it tho, I'm just starting Bunker Buster, can someone give me some spoilers on this?
---
&gt;!spoiler test!&lt;
---
Horse?? Ride a llama like a normal fucking person and maybe this won't be an issue next time. 
---
Ah you're right, I don't know where my -0.25 came from, a 75% reduction would make STR go from -4 to -1. Maybe it's even vs odd reductions!
---
Not really because many people purchased duped items too.
---
I'm sure some people honestly farmed and sold items, but when jetpacks and TSE are already owned by so many players who don't dupe themselves the economy is kind of screwed.
---
True but they're probably on the lookout for duping now
---
This comment is painful to me since this shouldn’t be a WOW THANKS BETH FOR THIS when in reality it’s just them fixing their broken game which should be expected.
---
I had the exact opposite of that happen I got out and my body stretched got a free 2nd frame out of it cause it duped it 
---
Yep, I've tried with couple other types of weapon it's the same result. I wonder if they are aware of this and if there would a solution to it.
---
This has been bugged for me since launch day
---
AWESOME!
---
(sorry about your friend, but glad this is being addressed)
---
So much same. It also doesn't help that this behavior was encouraged in previous Bethesda Fallout games. 
---
Found this out when i tried to power attack a ghould at white springs and ended throwing a grenade at the sentry bots, had to make a quick escape lol
---
One thing to note in those games, at least Mincraft and Ark, storage space is limited by the containers. You end up eating a lot of space in a base trying to keep everything. Also they don't link the storage so you also have to have a way to track where you put stuff.
---
I do wish FO76 did it like those games instead of the magic box.
---
Studios could learn a thing or two from Hello Games. 
---
Let's so, so for lore you just handwave over both games but somehow your handwave favors 76 which doesn't add anything to the lore but instead has to be justified in the lore in order to fit.
---
See you're making a mistake here. FO76 is a spinoff game, it makes sense from a game design perspective for all the different factions and enemies to have a presence in the game, but the lore justifications are reaching hard.
---
You think the factions in 76 are humanized? The only factions that have any real presence are raiders with Rose and enclave with modus. Every other faction is just notes and holotapes.
---
Gear in 76 is a distinct step backwards from 4. You're now forced to either server hop for a random chance at plans, find someone to trade with(shame we have no form of text chat, map advertising, or conveying our requests to other players beyond voip, real shame), or add visiting a particular vendor to your daily game chores. Daily chores that typically include farming for caps, farming for screws, farming for gears, farming for ballistic fiber, farming for gunpowder lead and steel for bullets if you use them etc. You now also need multiple of the same weapons and armor in order to break down, and once again randomly acquire mods. You can find mods in vendors but here we have another glaring problem: mods will be broken down for their component parts when crafting and building.
---
I don't see how you think building in 76 is better. We have fewer placeable items than we did in 4, granted you can buy some of them back from the atom store, and camp budget severely limits what you can do. Nonsensically not only do defensive items eat up a huge amount of your building budget, but they are at the same time nearly useless. It's also worth mentioning how much more expensive it is to build in 76 with things like gears springs et al being less common.
---
Progression is undeniably worse in 76. There is no clear route of progression, and thanks to how spawn weighting and other playersa affecting spawns, you could run into enemies triple your level or enemies 1/4th your level. The perk card system is a mess, between receiving duplicates from packs, to not being able to downgrade cards. And you better hope you planned your build well and picked the right stats and cards your first time through because respeccing is punishing. 1 special change OR 1 perk card per level? You're looking at a dozen additional levels or more if you need different specials to change weapon types. Really you're probably just better off starting a new character if you feel your build is messed up. 
---
Indeed! I hope this gets a lot of visibility and that Bethesda keeps swinging the banhammer often and hard. Dupers and mob-flamers of the game has been a true cancer so far. 
---
Well if you have an odd number of special points with a 75% reduction that would cause it to I’m thinking.
---
I had rank 1 and 2 of a card. Got an animated one from a pack and my non animated rank one disappeared
---
My game will also freeze and CTD after update, which it didnt do before. Let's hope it gets addressed in the next patch lol
---
There are multiple items with stove in the name under various headings in the build menu. Verify you are trying to place the correct one.
---
Stims are like one pound. I don't know if they fixed travelling pharmacy yet, but otherwise, stims are really heavy.
---
Level 120 here and played since beta. I've gotten a 1 shot explosive SMG (with armor piercing) and a 1 shot explosive gatling gun. The last 2 days I've gotten 3 two shot gattling guns. RNG is hating my melee/rifleman build.
---
&gt; This is an online game. You're not gonna get what you want from this type of game. You get a basic story, and then everyone runs around and kills each other. That's how this works.
---
Apparently you have never played an online rpg before, even from the same company we have ESO which has both characters, quests and a story.
---
I'm not sure what playstyle has to do with anything. Exploiting duplication bugs is cheating. 
---
Never heard of it
---
10 minutes? I wish...
---
do you have a source for this?
---
is the source your ass
---
No... They really aren't. Most players want to play the game as intended. 
---
It's particularly annoying if you spec into rifles because nothing reduces their carry weight, so you can't even carry backups around like you can if you specced into big guns with the bear arms perk.
---
With no level limit and only a finite amount of perks, eventually you’ll have every perk and probably at every rank. 
---
So there’s really no need for any buy back or swapping or trading. 
---
I think by level 52 you have access to all the different perks. Might be 55.
---
I freeze in Charleston. It's not a server issue. It's something they did with the last December patch. 
---
I'd be glad to help as I have Herbivore! I'll message you a detailed list of what is affected and what is not.
---
50% is definitly a good idea i will try.   herd mentality is a prime culprit i have my eyes on.     its not perfect but at least i might be able to get something out of it.
---
Yes. Says already learned.
---
I thought I was adapting but realized I just have a really narrow play style now. 
---
In previous Fallout games I used to hoard ammo and use any weapon I came across that I had ammo for as you would in a survival game, with the exception of melee, never been a fan. Same with armor, I’d hoard it and save up different types of armor for different situations. 
---
I liked that I’d come across a point in the game where my play style had to shift or I’d run out of ammo and have to run home to change my weapons or armor. Or build new weapons or make more ammo with my junk I’ve collected. 
---
Now I only use my X-01 PA, All Rise Supersledge, and Tesla rifle for basically every occasion and sell everything else because I don’t have any place to store it. 
---
Agree. I feel like there should be a separate storage container for armor &amp; weapons and another one for everything else
---
You must be new to multiplayer games.
---
&gt;Storyline isn't the core mechanic and you almost never have story options that completely diverge your endgame position away from that of everyone else unless it's faction based.
---
You're right, thankfully we have fallout 76's rich and engaging faction system to uh... No actually we have pvp to keep us coming back so we can er... Well at least there's always a nuked white springs to steamroll green ghouls at with 10+ other players.
---
wouldnt that only happen if they attacked each other
---
I mean Atlas is awful from everything I see but at least you can get a refund. Fallout 76? "People who downloaded the game aren't eligible for a refund"
---
Yes, I have gone to desktop and relaunched the game multiple times since the update yesterday. Even moved my camp multiple times and every time I move it, it gets a little worse. 
---
Yeeeeeah... The Daedric Prince of Slavery and Rape definitely deserves whatever ill we can throw at him. 
---
Huh? That makes no sense, lol.
---
The man is talking about being totally alone on the server, launching a nuke then the server kicking him.
---
So .. what? I'm lost.
---
This is h(j)uge! I won't expect that Bethasda is pulling all registers on finding everyone who duped, but it's the first announcement that duping in fact is a bannable offense!
---
They can lower the distance to what the rocket turrets distance is + blast radius... turrets dont shoot 150m thats for sure. 
---
Are you happy for publishers to sell defective products, as long as the defects are not not used by consumers ?
---
THAT would be a easy fix to stop people's ability to one shot people in passive mode after taking 1000 bobbleheads.  Cancel the stacking ability of them, you take a melee you get the effects, you take 10 melees you only get 1's worth of effects. Taking 1000 and getting said effects is lazy.
---
Bethesda has made statements that there will be new vaults opening in the future as they add more content to the game- they're just placeholders for now.
---
\*kill me fam
---
There sure are a bunch of dupers in this thread. Taste that salt.
---
If you don't see the difference between an actual MMO and the style of game that 76 is I don't know what to tell you. I have played almost every MMO since Ultima Online. You put unrealistic expectations on this game and were disappointed. It happens. 
---
Which is especially ironic, as Wireshark will most likely get a far greater unfair advantage than editing client-side memory in an online game.
---
However, I still do not even know what their defense triggered to. Maybe it's all about macroses, not CE at all…
---
Totally, non-capitalist countries have all the best games and servers eyeroll.jpg.

in a year the game might just be finished! woohoo!

I have a video that shows a low competition area that has a guaranteed spawn of 1-3 pieces of level 15 raider PA.  Hope this helps!

There's a cooking stove and a wood stove. I was trying to use the cooking stove.
---
How much did it cost?
---
Pic?
---
I like the format, but yeah high level mugging I can really do without.
---
I don’t consider my game time as amusement for others, and chose not to participate 
---
So that some asshat can feel better about their gaming experience.
---
you said you gone
---
lied?
---
:ooo
---
I HAVE A MIGHTY NEED TO BUY THAT DOOR NOW!
---
No, have pacifist have a stronger affect from 5 to 10/15. Basically you neither do damage nor receive it and your C.A.M.P cannot be attacked by players with a clear warning that all bets are off when they hit level 10/15.
---
This gives new players more time to actually acquire decent gear and weapons for PvP or you can fully opt in. Usually at low level you have a hard time with ammo unless you know how to farm for it early. 
---
I feel your pain. Bethesda, a once respected studio for me really shit the bed on this one, especially after not refunding. They ignore your support tickets. Not sure why you're getting downvotes. You have my axe!
---
Mine still does.
---
I hate that YouTube keeps suggesting videos that bash Fallout 76. I like the game. I don’t want to hear why others think I should hate it instead when most of them haven’t really played it and certainly haven’t played it after the recent patches.
---
Stupid CAMP budget isnt working still.
---
no. that won´t work either i guess. egghead gives a -3.  just because they hate me.     
---
be glad
---
If you payed $60 for it, you preordered it based on Bethesda's name, the Fallout IP, and BETA footage. You knew *exactly* what you were buying.
---
I'm not going to defend BGS putting out broken games.
---
But I'm not going to buy into the victim mentality of gaming consumers when it comes to preorders. 
---
Yea, thanks for trying to do your job
---
Hopefully they will ban everyone exploiting glitches, they a sizeable part of the problem.
---
Agreed, but I would rather have them go after bugs and then QOL improvements 
---
I use every mutation but empath birdbones and herd mentality and I have no issue with barbarian and evasive with class freak 3
---
I've moved it several times so far and the part in storage stays in storage. I don't get a blueprint for them to dismantle/replace nor do they show up as individual items. I have absolutely nothing showing up under my storage tab. 
---
Yeah, the idea of instantly going from a 1 strength sniper build to a 15 strength melee send silly. If you are completely changing your character, make a new one, or do the gradual shift respec. Grind out the 10 or 20 levels, it really doesn't take that long. And if you *really* can't stand the idea of being suboptimal for a few days, just save up the level-ups until you have enough to do it all at once. 
---
Besides, since you don't lose the perks you unequip (and there's a lot of perks shared across builds anyway), and most builds don't run around with a bunch of 1s in special, you're going to hit a point where swapping builds back and forth only takes 5 or 10 levels. Just keep a few levels banked, and swap on a whim.
---
Yeahhh stop and frisk, is a bullshit irl policy. Not needed post apoc.
---
No idea. I didn’t block them. Don’t know why or how they would have blocked me.  I had gone to get the kids in the bath and come back and this dude is looking at me through my door just staring and then boom his friend comes mashing through my CAMP. 
---
The sites I was using for finding power armors:
---
* https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/11/27/fallout-76-power-armour-locations-all-the-power-armor-locations/
---
* https://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-76-power-armor-location-guide/
---
I think most of the power armor pieces found at these locations vary among all types (raider, T45, T51b, T60) so they also have quite variable minimum level requirements, but locations that are raider camps (skull in a braided circle icon) are far more likely to have raider pieces that are far more likely to be the lowest minimum level (15).  Most raider camps are in Savage Divide, a higher level zone, but The Crosshair is lower level, to the extreme north on the border between the forest (greenness) and toxic valley (whiteness), just north of Clancy Manor, which is found along that northern road.
---
I don't really care if you retract your statement. The game needs work. It'll get there. I do wish they'd give refunds just so you guys would get over it and move on with your lives. 
---
&gt; If you don't see the difference between an actual MMO and the style of game that 76 is I don't know what to tell you. 
---
Oh I'll tell you the first difference myself
---
Content.  MMOs have that.  76 is basically nothing but leveling up and customizing your little plot.
---
Do you have 10k plus of said wood?
---
Definitely what he said with Healing Factor and Speed Demon. I’d add in Bird Bones for fall damage as it is fun just running around jumping all over the place. Healing Factor will instantly heal any fall damage which is reduced anyway with Bird Bones. Gives -4 STR though so I made sure to have max Class Freak perk first. That’s your call.
---
Personally I like the sense of loneliness, and I understand that real life people are meant to be companions. However, I do think perhaps you should be able to “tame” a Brahmin and use it like a pack mule for extra carry weight. But then you have the issue of people killing it in order to take the items stored on it.
---
Do they really have a choice?
---
Aww no shit?  I didn't realize.  Me and my friends were discussing making our settlements into a little town, but had yet to try it.
---
I agree -- just want to point out that video and the worst games video are separate videos he will put out to make more money as a professional complainer
---
I have a lot of gripes about the game but I still agree with you. 
---
I am not worried that we wont see the fixes we want, I am more worried that we won't see them soon enough to keep the game alive. 
---
Whether we like it or not, people move to new games fast. Even faster when a game isn't providing them with constant entertainment. Some people might drop off because their friends do and so on and so forth. 
---
I really do think Bethesda will give us the game we want, I just hope we can get some of these major game fixes in soon. 
---
Not for me personally, but for the game itself. 
---
I feel like a lot of people are hanging by a thread here to see how Bethesda is handling their updates. Some are more patient than others. 
---
The game needs its supporters right now. Hopefully we can get some major QOL changes in the next update. 
---
also the @fallout twitter
---
Literally everytime i go to whitesprings people just shoot at me with there tse shotguns and xo1 power armor  marsupial mutations and jetpacks. Because there so bored with the game they have to ruin the experience for other players,  i dont feel like wasting my stimpacks on idiots. Also its just about impossible to shoot any ghouls because these guys just one shot everything anyways.
---
I had this issue. Before the second patch I had the plans and could build it. After it said I needed to find the plans. So I purchased it and it key me read it and now I'm good. 
---
Are you on PC? Only ask because of the latest patch. Hoping it's not a new bug or an old one returned. 
---
OK, just let me know!
---
I love that!
---
We used to call them loot ninjas just some entitled jerk trying grab other folks stuff.
---
Was exactly the same thing for me. Sorry to hear moving your camp doesn't work. 
---
That's your opinion. I disagree. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
makes sense.   -75% is perfect to even out egghead.  if you had herd mentality on top it would be a different story.
---
I like ESO, but I would love a real ES online game. I know that we ain't getting one, but now that this engine has online writen in it, maybe there is a co-op in next ES? Probably not.
---
I am well aware that it might be bogus but i'll take it. Fuck dupers! Sorry for the bad language.
---
I don’t like your idea, but i like that your contributing to the dialogue, take this upvote as thanks!
---
Is the Mothman really.... *a man?...*
---
I get tons of random request .. but those asses are generally using you/me for a free fast travel and nothing more. Since 9/10 times they are across the map or even in stealth out of view of the map so you can't see them.
---
I ignore them all unless you're doing the same event or fighting in the same area I am in.
---
Nothing worse than being used cause some lazy ass doesn't wanna spend 20 caps.
---
Nice, I've been hopping there for about two weeks now a few hours a day looking for the same, minus some diversions when I see a quest to do, or someone in a silo and wait for their launch.
---
I've seen like 1000 motion assist servos. The first week I would hop both the train station and Phoenix too but stopped that this week.
---
It is the true end game, unfortunately I feel like once I get out I might stop playing tho... Cuz then what :(
---
He's in a freaking pvp zone and he forgot to stash his junk! hes just an idiot! dont be an idiot!
---
Not trying to start shit but why do so many people say this? I played Oblivion and Skyrim and ESO is probably my favourite. I know the gameplay itself is different but there's loads of lore and memorable characters like the previous entries.
---
I can't agree it's not a bug - the amount of resource mods give you are irrelevant and if it really told you "you're about to scrap your mod" it'll be ok, but it doesn't - it just tell you if you'll use scrapped or bulk material and the amount. There is not a word you're about to scrapp mod.
---
I like that they're patching but this last one created more bugs imo than before it. 
---
Rekt, get fucked dupers 
---
ESO is one of the best MMOs out there? Seriously? Imagine what it could have been if they didn't lose most of their player base in the first place.
---
What do you do with your legendary items? Everyone is to cautious to trade anymore because of these spam-traders.
---
Hardened mass is still junk. They just said they fixed the auto scrapping
---
There is a difference between opinion and verifiable fact, this is the latter
---
I'm aware of that, but 15+ people crouching every time I checked the map for at least 30 minutes? No sounds of distant battle as I fast traveled around? Also, everyone's recent list was empty by the time we noticed, excepting one person we knew who popped in, and then promptly left. I'm telling you man, we slipped through a crack between world's.
---
What I called "Jack's House" is what you call the Pumpkin House.  I figure that by the time people get the daily there for the first time they'll know they're there, but they might not know or have forgotten you can get them in The Forest.
---
Oh no, first I had to survive enough to get to 50. Then the extra 100 levels were for crafting :)
---
I dont see notes about the mission “early warnings” where the crafted motors disappears and can’t complete the mission?? So its not fixed yet im assuming. Sad life -_- 
---
....... Have you been living under a rock? It's only what has been discussed practically since the game came out as a major reason for server instability. 
---
Wow.
---
Everyone else has it. They are still dumb7.
---
No, no it is not. 
---
something i recently started doing: accept the invite and ask "hey are you looking to play together, just want group bonuses (herd mentality, inspirational) while playing solo, or just free fast travel?" usually theyll tell you what and ic youre cool with it, keep them in your group, if not, leave the team. it didnt occur to me until recently that sometimes people dont even want to play together, they just want a benefit of group play.
---
Lol. It's weird never hearing any sound software distant battle once you notice.
---
Ahhh. I have sturday trapper, not light or heavy
---
Everything.
---
I’d say keep a close watch.
---
Personally, I’d move someplace more discreet but you know locality value based on quest items best.
---
I just don’t want to keep spending my time and mats repairing stuff.
---
And the whole glowing one fix.
---
It's fucking annoying when people demand they fix everything then go "We didn't mean that, assholes!"
---
Alright dude. Whatever. Your opinions are fact and not totally subjective you win. Have a good one. 
---
It's fixed yeah but you do what any smart duper did before that patch came in. Just dump it all onto one character you are never going to use again and make sure he is left at Vault 76. That way you can always be fast travelled too. 
---
I don't condone this but nearly everything good I've attempted to buy funnily enough asks can I come to vault 76 and this is the reason why.
---
Well for me, I need to have some sort of conversation first. No sense wasting each other’s time if our play styles aren’t going to work together.
---
It kinda sucks but if you bash an enemy they stagger backwards. Fill them with lead while they do. It’s good for when you just need a bit more damage to finish them.
---
Note: bashing impacts durability a lot more than shooting.
---
Second idea: One Gun Army. Enemies shot have a chance for stagger and limb crippling. It’s a % chance, but you use the .50 so the rapid fire works for you here. 
---
Last: You have high strength. Get a weapon with high stagger and crippling chances, like a rocket baseball bat. Aim low when you swing. Let’s see them toesies! After they’re crippled, swap back to the .50 and give them 30+ reasons to not invade your personal space.
---
*THE* XxV@p3G0d69XxX?!
---
Yesss! The first couple times I logged into the game I was horribly surprised in the first gun fight. Nice they fixed it. 
---
Actually yes they could've just did what they wanted but instead they listened to the players.
---
Most people agree, majority just get points across in a dickish way instead of realising it takes times to smooth things out and they want it right now. Agree the game was a mess but it’s become way more stable and enjoyable with each patch and if I have to wait to enjoy it even more then so be it. 
---
Those power armor mods could have been end-game rare drops from *** mobs but unfortunately the most desired mods are acquired by playing hop-the-server.  Missed opportunity here big-time.
---
The regular ones shouldn't be less. They said specifically in the patch notes that the glowing ones were giving too much XP specifically.
---
Probably dupers trying to find a new way to dupe. Hopefully Bethesda can see who's causing lag and see what they're up to. I don't know what all they are capable of and I'd rather they keep that info to themselves. 
---
i sometimes do that not because im cheap ass but because i run empath and overweight. that +3 to strength really helps for that
---
I've had the same thoughts and have begun organizing a player faction for this purpose. 
---
No not totally, You all clearly don't understand satire either. 
---
800 adhesive and 7 springs? Not a dupe, this is just a wild idiot who thinks that Pack Rat entitles him to carry his entire Stash worth of junk. He was just a fool to initiate combat or get a bounty.
---
Disappointing I gave you the benefit of the doubt but you won't do the same. Fanboi's gonna be a fanboi. Accept what you are, don't try to use it for false ego boosting.
---
How sad can you be to complain on a post about people complaining? If you think that’s sad, you complaining about it is even sadder. 
---
There are "Bloated" glowing ones and regular glowing ones. By the looks of it both got hit with the exp nerf hammer.
---
I'm not talking about regular ghouls.
---
+1
---
I like stuff
---
It's not an opinion, I'm talking about what is available in game.  Opinion would be whether I find it enjoyable it or not
---
Definitely NOT Bethesda’s worst title. You ever play Rogue Warrior? Fallout tactics? Pirates of the Caribbean? Terrible awful games. 
---
They sad to the community if you don't like it don't buy it (wich is basicly what every sailsman does if you don't like pinneaple on a Pizza you wont gonne buy a Pizza with pinaples ) in my opinion it become more tactical than bf1 becouse of the higher TTK and no 3d spotting Spam but thats just my opinion and this thred is about fallout 76
---
Honestly as long as they're out, I don't really care either way. 
---
There's a way to do it, it's just foolish since Atom Store is Bethesda's cash generator. 
---
Duped stuff and caps are just data, but that Atom stuff is ***profit***. They made people write on the chalkboard 500 times that they were sorry for cheating in the only public corrective action they've taken so far, but you can bet that when they get their shit together they will go out of their way to hunt down and fuck over anybody who is walking around with skins they didn't pay for.
---
Best case it'll just vanish from your stuff eventually.
---
Maybe a bit off, but it still looks like the lever has better numbers in every category.  My understanding is that weapon levels are in increments of 10, so max for some is 45 and others 50.  Handmade rifle is also max 45.
---
The .308 has a decent choice of magazine options (including improved armor penetration and/or reload speed) where the lever has no options, so that might move it back ahead in my book.  I also use the recon scope on the .308, but could live without it.  Still, the lever is better that I thought it was.  I think the only ones i found were at lower levels so I didn't pay much attention.
---
Thanks sad I have to wait a week for next update I’m on console
---
My biggest regret in life is selling my quad single action. Sure, reloading took long enough to idle-disconnect if I didn't move around during the animation, but the physics-breaking nonsense of rotating the cylinder 1/6th turn and adding a bullet, 24 times was hilarious.
---
I did. But I know I am not the norm. Better armor/repairs have always made Beth games easier in my experience. 15 INT - and loving it.
---
Nope. Extensively researched this before taking Healing Factor serum to finish the mutation build I wanted. Already had Carnivore and it worked fine and I’ve kept it since.
---
Really? I haven't heard anything about making duplicates on it. Glitches, sure. The queen never going down, servers freezing, map respawn points disappearing. 
---
Yes, I do essentially live under a rock that's why I was posting on Reddit so early in the morning. This is my only outlet to anything involving people in the world. And when I look up fallout, I'm looking for help via their wiki page (what has gears, how the hell do you successfully kill a wendigo, etc) and not the news. The only news I get is from here, and this is the first "duping" thread I've ever seen
---
Right the robot's name. I didn't do that event so I missed the connection. Too busy looking for rare crafting materials lol. My bad.
---
But do you know what to day is?
---
New perk?
---
If it was a single player game it wouldnt be a big deal. But its a multiplayer game where 1 players actions have consequences for everyone else. Ive played games where duping items becomes prevelant. There have been nights when you cant even play the game because the servers are constantly crashing. It hasnt reached this state in fallout YET but if it doesnt get fixed soon it will. If you are causing problems for everyone else its unfair. They have paid for the game the same as you, so if you are intentionally ruining peoples experience you should be punished
---
I have my spots connected to a switch so I can just flip them off and back on again when I come back to camp.  It appears they are made from cheap, wireless routers.
---
You've obviously never seen toys from the '50s. Tonka trucks will outlive us all.
---
All fun and games until you fuck up my experience by crashing my server, killing me and my friends with fake weapons, preventing loot from spawning on bodies or stoppinge from being able to craft at workbenches. Don't pretend like this is *fun* for everyone, it's fun at the expense of other players. Get fucked r/fallout, take the mental gymnastics with you
---
"Disappointing" means he had expectations. Atlas was probably not that important to him anyways, so it makes sense to be less disappointing for him. 
---
But I absolutely agree that the game is getting too much shit. Yeah, it is nowhere great, but I really, REALLY enjoyed my 100 hours I put into it. 
---
Was it combat armor you were scrapping?
---
A couple sets like the combat armor, the mods seems to either be for limbs or chest. So when you scrap a combat armor leg, you can get both leg + arm mods.
---
Robot and trapper might be the same, but I havent really tested either.
---
Just to point out, it's been stated previously and on the announcement of the game that there would be no NPCs, so idk where those speculations would've come from. But I agree, they need to change that for DLCA, at least a secondary base with settlers protecting our camp. 
---
Thx!
---
ESO has added to and developed more the lore than Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim combined, to be honest. I love it.
---
Also Naryu and Razum-dar best characters ever.
---
Yeah yeah. You win you're super smart. I have better things to do than deal with someone that thinks making demands is a reasonable way to have a conversation. Have a good one. 
---
As the guy bellow pointed out. You tend to have to stack a lot of things together to get the damage that high and you also have to proc most perks that add multiplicative % for damage. The only downside to this build is that you have to solely use 2h melee weapons. If you want to shoot at range and actually do damage you need very good guns to do it. For example 2 shot explosive gun.
---
Means I can get around 2k damage with my axe and about 800 with my shotgun/handmade.
---
Self tapping sheet metal screws, &amp; pop rivets 👍
---
I dont know how to show u the pic on a reply ..I'm at work anyway have a good one saved in photomode and one on phone when i got it ..but trust me 100 percent  I have it or I owe u 25k in caps which u have this messege as proof to collect or I'll be bashed on here ..
---
Love this. There needs to be more ways of getting ballistic fibre 
---
“Cheaters”
---
Holy shit.
---
You are the type to call people “griefers" that try and take over occupied workshops
---
Sensitive infant! Remember and put the caps back on your Play-Doh tubs son.
---
They are always broken. You need to hook them up to their own button (they can all be wired back to one) and turn the the power off and back on. You pretty much need to do it everytime you log in. Need to be fixed up.
---
Typical PC troubleshooting, have you tired turning it on and off again :P
---
There is in game paints
---
True...
---
\^ This.
---
LOL- you can always tell in comments about stuff like this who has a real job and who is an asshat in their mom's basement with no grasp of business or rw economics.
---
No, it did give Ballistic Fiber from Power Armor Chassis/Frames in BETA and early on but the was changed.
---
... that’s what software is for. Literally that kind of mass automation is why we use computers. A well written algorithm could probably scrape that data from every character in the game in a couple hours. 
---
So you are advocating using a glitch to catch glitchers to report?
---
I dont understand how some players can have literally millions of duped items on their character but we can only stash 600lbs. If its actually a server stability issue why is it a weight limit and not an item number limit? Theres no way that 6 100lb items in a stash would have the same effect as 600 0lb notes in your stash
---
Exactly, until now they only repaired their broken game.
---
Got this game a few weeks ago for christmas. Loved it ever since, it's not perfect (bit of a cliche I know) and has it's fair share of pros and cons. But I am now level 57. I have been playing nonstop. 
---
I knew it wouldn't stay a secret forever...  Been squatting there for over a month. 
---
GAMERS RISE UP!!1!1! 😂😂😂
---
Again: breaking the rules is a choice, he made that choice and must now live with the consequences. How are you not getting this?
---
PC NewtGingrinch
---
I freeze in Charleston. It's ever single time. Complete lock up, unresponsive in taskmanager.
---
  I did beta and never had this issue all through beta. After the 2nd patch, this freezing issue started happening. It's not just Charleston either, it's anywhere the town. I can be at the Tea Pot Events or even take the Charleston landfill but on walking closer to the station or dried out lake bed area, the whole game freezes. In order to get unstuck, I have to alt, cont, del. to leave the game, then reload, and hope I can open the map and fast travel before your game immediately freezes me again. 
---
I can deal with the server disconnects and the people cheesing out the game, but having an giant area of the game inaccessible sucks the big one. 
---
I had my brother (who has no issue with this freezing) come and see what my character was doing when it froze. I fasttraveled to Charleston train station. Loaded in and started slowly walking to the entrance and instantly froze. He said my character began running (I had been walking) into the wall and didn't stop. Would run out of AP and huff and puff and then tried running again. I don't know what this is but I'm begging you to fix it or look into this. 350+ hours played so far. Please treat this seriously. 
---
Can you shoot while reloading?  As in pause the animation before it gets to full and start shooting again?
---
How many bugs you think the first content update will bring?
---
And the combat shotguns sell really well!
---
They wouldn't be manually looking, they'd just run a database search to find all accounts matching some criteria then possibly go through those results manually 
---
I was told once that it is becoming more the norm to essentially release a beta version and let people work out the glitches. Since they can her about problems in real time they can start working on patches. It's cheaper that way.
---
Maybe not the most honest way to do business but it did help me accept the fact the game kind of really sucked the beginning of November
---
I'm sorry, you are free to play any way you like and you might actually enjoy  traveling manually but fighting over encumbered instead of being able to freely run.. just why?
---
I'm willing to bet you,  just like I did, have a ton of stuff you will never use. The big savers are usually dropping missiles, mininukes,  gauss ammo and 40mm and grenades/mines. Next one is bulking it up. Sell or drop the junk you will never us like bone shards. Run with the combo of perks for -weight of junk, chems and food/water. 
---
On top of everything, people have been saying it, and from my own experience I believe it's at least partially true, people like that that carry around 1000 lbs of everything on them, just lag people around them when it comes to looting mobs. The endless cogwheels is what I'm talking about.
---
You also probably don't need half of the one starred weapons/armor that you're lugging with you.
---
Anyway, I guess you're enjoying playing like that but idk, being tied to a certain zone and wasting so much time on traveling around, I just don't see the point of it.
---
So that's why someone very anoyingly tried to move in front of me all the time during a Queen fight. I don't have any explosive weapon though.
---
With that look, I’d try a sentry bot helmet. Failing that, a metal helmet + gas mask and goggles(the one that is black) would match up nicely.
---
I have a black mining helmet(they come in random colors) that I love for this, cause I prefer the bright light replacement for the pip boy light. With gas mask, of course.
---
All gas masks I swap out for skull bandana + eyewear of some kind, if for some reason the PER penalty gets annoying. Usually Fashionable Glasses.

After 10.1.2019 patch, I have had more game crashes than ever before. Whether it be building in camp, questing all over the map or trading at vendors, I have had over 20 crashes in the last 12 hours of playing on and off throughout the day. 
---
Buddy in my team got random PA dupe that appeared when he logged in. 
---
White springs bunker is laggy AF, massive frame rate drops even if nobody else is there. 
---
Ghouls, scorch beasts and Scorch Beast queen all have random health regeneration when taking damage or just manoeuvring around during combat. 
---
Nvidia 980Ti, core i770K, 16gb ram
---
Putting PA mods in stash, still gets it scrapped?
---
Uh because they take 1 of every type of pure flux each?

---
Yeah I would say so, but you gotta remember when you server hop Phoenix you aren't gambling in just 1 power armor mod set but 3. I found the T-51b Jet Pack plan 700 tries before I got what I was aiming for.
---
if you're playing solo swap squad and strange for 3* lone wanderer or max suppressor
---
If people can't play the game fairly don't play the game.
---
Did you try messaging one of the mods?
---
Just because you don’t like the game doesn’t mean other people can’t like the game. Fun fact: not everyone has the same opinion!
---
Personally, I’m having fun. I have not experienced the game breaking issues you describe. If you don’t like the game don’t play it. Why do you care if other people like it? 
---
It's terrible. I don't even switch while camp building, i just do my best with wasd on my keryboard :(, that need a fix asap
---
I've had poor luck with the steak house. Every time I go there there is a ton of enemies to shoot but I never get a legendary one. its always about 12 super mutants and a crowned super mutant.
---
I have had luck going to west tec and watoga, between those two i normally get at least 2 3*'s
---
Both this game &amp; FO4 alt-tab fine for me, and force stop has as well the few times I've needed it. Problem may be more localized. 
---
There does, especially with them making higher leveled armor cost ballistic fiber to craft.
---
You signed the TOS, the moment you used an exploit you violated that contract giving zenimax the power to terminate your account as it is stated in one of the clauses 
---
Umm regarding the Ross quest wasn’t it made abundantly clear in the beginning that she was a Mr. Handy or whatever the “female” equivalent is? Perhaps I misremember. 
---
Lol some dude I was trading with gave me a black baseball bat with a mod called all star. I was also thinking of scrapping it but I don’t want to risk it. I wonder what other colors you can get.
---
So the other day I was grinding heavy on fo76 and decided to take a break to learn about how people have SO many items in their inventory. After a quick google I  discovered that people duplicate items and then resell it online. This was disheartening for me as here I am grinding it all out when I could've just been duping? I ended up buying a different game to take a break from Fallout. But I might be back this weekend lol. 
---
But I was enjoying my quad lever action 
---
Unsure. Ask again in 2 months.
---
Friday?
---
&gt; and quit the game due to boredom 
---
That works as well.
---
I think this would hurt the games model more then help it.  Would you want a feature in FO4 that just eliminated all traces of raiders from the game?   76 is giving the players an outlet to RP as raiders (or bounty hunters) if they want, and that is a fantastic concept. Also, how would workshops function? First come first serve? 
---
I extract the textures from the new power armor skin, and the prototype skin, then i simply rename the files from the new skin into the prototype skin, repackage them as a ba2 with baka file tool, and load them in through the ini like any mod.
---
Correction: Zenimax Online. 
---
Zenimax is the parent company of both Bethesda and Zenimax Online. But you are correct none the less. 
---
Still, not like the couldn't call up one of the people over there and ask for "things they've learned" like how their inventory management works for one thing. 
---
I have tried replacing the wires but this doesn't work. Will need to try a switch when I have the plans. 
---
That guy is just a dumbass that doesn't research all the facts. He's the Trump of youtube
---
&gt;The Scorchbeast AI is so insanely bad that even most people who say the game is good admit that scorchbeasts are totally messed up, I can send you literally hundreds of videos showing this
---
I agree, i'm not saying the AI isn't terrible at times, I also run with a loud party who attracts many enemies, it's more common to see that you do when you walk into a room if you are sneaky
---
Just like how they said they improved server stability, and within an hour of playing I get disconnected twice and kicked off once for maintenance. 
---
A permanban is completely acceptable, you signed the TOS and agreed to the terms and conditions set forth within the contract. 
---
Definitely a missed opportunity, would be a much better story to tell how I grinded quests and enemies instead of a vendor's shop inventory.. 
---
It's a good start but there are a lot of other bugs and issues they have left to fix and a lot more improvements to quality of life for the game
---
5 times in less than an hour this morning. Pretty frustrating. 
---
Will need to try a switch when I have the plans.
---
Yes it is worth it 
---
What most people fail to realize is that the Whitespring campers are only hurting themselves.  In between people coming there's a lot of dead periods waiting for the ghouls to respawn.
---
The 40s who are trying to level should kill what they can, then server hop immediately.  Its an almost guaranteed spawn if you server hop the golf club.  Kill, loot, heal, hop, repeat.  Don't bother checking what you loot or sorting inventory.  If you happen to come across one of those bases that's not locked up just use it to scrap and repair weapons to keep your cycle going (I use them to cook glowing meat and repair weapons).  Once you're done, then walk back to the Whitespring (cause you'll be 100% overencumbered) and figure out everything else.
---
They would just scroll dupe paintbrushes and jump back up.
---
I believe it scales off the number of players.  I've had more than 3 on multiple occasions.
---
Oh I forgot they have different plans for that, sorry. Look for Advanced Power Connectors plans.
---
Maybe they're watching and gathering evidence to take actual legal action against him
---
That would be fucking awesome 
---
One of my camps is currently straddling it, but I think ill be moving soon.  
---
You will get a better update, PC is testing it for you.
---
I'd love to see that mod list! 
---
this would be pretty cool, it could be like a big drill press or a lathe that you could place to build things out of steel. At the very least grafton steel should have some sort of machine to make these just like the munition factory. It would add much needed value to the workshop since currently there isnt much value there, especially at higher levels.
---
You know it :)
---
Ya theres like 6 or 8 colours all star is the top one next to pink and u can scrap it it's not rare .. I have them all and there easy to get by scrapping bats but pink is not even suppose to be in game yet I guess now that is rare ...
---
They should just make junk weightless in the box 
---
Don't project what others have said about another game on me. Selling broken games is selling broken games and it's bullshit. 
---
Pretty sure that restocks vendors for players, not that they buy them from vendors.
---
Would it be too much to ask for a better option than peacemaker, for those of us that care nothing for PvP?
---
If I want to PvP, there are much better options than FO76. Why are we forced into it?
---
Love this! It is funny do how the article seems to at least some degree think that it is strange/bad that alt accounts got the boot too but maybe it is just me being paranoid from overall "lets trash Bethesda" mob in digital media.
---
Yes I am a abused fanboy, sue me! ;)
---
It's an alternate reality to the elder scrolls universe. I'm not sure where the timeline branching point exists if it does or if it's just a parallel universe. Let's them get away with changing lore as needed to expand the game. 
---
Still, I really enjoy out, but got burned out a bit.  FO76 makes me want to play it though. Both games back and forth actually. So yeah... thanks Bethesda! 
---
Yeah, ban most of the players on a struggling game, great idea that.
---
The Crosshair.  It's a raider camp in the mountains almost directly north of Clancy Manor.  Just a couple scorched there and there's usually a partial suit of raider PA just sitting there in the camp.  Very easy to get.
---
Pet battles and Naxxramas ?
---
I know of a relatively reliable spot. [It's in a shack above the satellite crash. ](https://i.imgur.com/7R9HhuD.jpg) You're going to have to climb up a cliff but you should able to see the shack from the ground. 
---
Rare mods and plans really piss me off at this point. I've spent 10+ hours at this point searching for excavator calibrated shocks and the plan. A week ago a friend found one at 6am and messaged me. You better believe I hopped on and paid him handsomely for it. Today, another friend found me a second one! Of course less than an hour later I bought the very first one I ever saw, and put it in my damn box. AAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGH!
---
Also, I can craft the t-51 jetpack on PS4. Found that plan 2 days ago while I was trying to find excavator calibrated shocks.
---
Friend had to get me x01 calibrated shocks too. 
---
And last night I also finally got the brotherhood shielded lining. Like 150 technical data later. A friend who can still carry technical data as stacks of worthless paper has been coming over with me periodically and handing them to me 1 at a time. The rest has been me finding one, jumping to Venture, going back, finding another, going back to Venture, going back.....
---
I wasn't sure some of this crap existed for 160 levels.
---
The ivory hilt is a funny meme and all but that was kind of dumb. There is a purpose in a tse community. The right TSE users together can kill the Scorch Beast Queen in under 3 minutes. Are you having fun trying to start something with strangers on the internet though? I hope you are otherwise it's just sad.
---
Yeah, because that's totally what I'm doing 😂😂😂
---
Have fun throwing tantrums on Internet, manbaby!
---
I mean, I'm glad it's fixed, and now it's consistent with the single action revolver and pump shotgun, which is good, *but* the problem is blown a little out of proportion. The 5 bullet reload wasn't *that* long. From playing around with it a little, the full 5 bullet reload felt like it was faster than just 2 or 3 bullets of a single action revolver reload (and much quicker than a single round reload of a black powder anything). So it's definitely a nice fix, for qol, realism, consistency, etc., but going so far as saying the weapon was broken and unusable before? That's like some first world problems level hyperbole, imo.
---
Yes. You're going to get $20 of enjoyment out of it. The late game is busted as fuck right now but when you get there, just focus on Power Armor Space Marine RP until Bethesda fixes more bugs.
---
[I could always use more toilet paper.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/ae36du/sure_cant_wait_for_bethesda_to_increase_the_stash/)
---
I would go for bolstering as anything other than melee just for the extra defenses.  Unyielding is great for melee simply because STR directly relates to drastically scaling our damage.  Since none of the other stats cause a direct increase in damage like STR does for melee, I am not sure what the benefit would be.
---
That's what it really felt like too, eerie music and "everything". 
---
So frustrated right now. I just finished the motherlode quest as I was trying to get to the Med center for An Ounce of Prevention and the game kicked me off the server. Now the quest is gone! I do NOT want to start it all over but I am not sure what else to do. Any advice? 
---
Shhh... it's okay, my boy. Just let them flow. It's okay to cry sometimes.
---
I love the game, Just wish the main quest was a bit longer. 
---
That, and also how to never give up, never surrender. I'd say PEOPLE could learn a thing or two from Hello Games. 
---
About 1300 caps with Hard Bargain rank 3.
---
Make sure you add melee to that list. It's a hell of a lot more OP than TSE.
---
Yeah things are so sad....wiping a tear...
---
Vendors are reset every time you log in, that’s why server hopping for mods works. 
---
Good list, fishing was the first thing to come to mind for me as well.  All games have to start somewhere, and I hope Bethesda's intention is to continually expand this game into a full living and breathing world.
---
have my thump up for Uranos
---
Yes, ps4
---
At $20 I would buy multiple and give the extras to friends. Excellent price to pay for this game
---
How the hell does a laser explode?
---
Shouldn't be able to even have explosive lasers...give them another effect, like cauterizing.  Shoots through an enemies armor like it was butter and doesn't allow Regen or something...
---
Grumble grumble *angry old man rant
---
Players in your team can add new items in your camp, but can't delete anything. So yup, your buddy gave ya some stuff
---
I have the plans if you are on PS4 (advanced power connectors) 188 caps if you need 
---
I wondered this as well.  I’d love to revisit the earlier games. 
---
I like to have one of each billet firing gun type in my box, like for example if I move for too much .308, switch to my hunting rifle for a while and use that. Too much .44? Lever action, combat, or radium rifle. I never carry missiles or mini nukes though, they’re too damn heavy.
---
Is someone paying you to be a salty fuck shitting up the sub with your crusty months old complaints? Maybe get better at managai g your money and stop bitching about 60 bucks for fake internet points?
---
Taking people's workshops is part of the game...
---
It was definitely affected by Speed Demon before this patch. I've been using the lever action as my main since I got Speed Demon and it made the reload bug basically a non-issue.
---
I'd rather they first let us save loadouts/decks. Then they can worry about letting us do something with unwanted cards. 
---
Yes Bethesda is cashing out on their own greed with people that have exploited an accidental bug in a game. That omly makes sense for fuck wits like you.
---
Seems like you have a difficult time dealing with a coherent debate! 
---
Banmunition* ;)
---
Nah GTAO did the warning thing.. and it did nothing.
---
Yes. Log into your Bethesda.net account.
---
Maybe they're stacking bobbleheads to get super high int?
---
blueprints only use items you have in storage. if you were to place a blueprint of your house down then try and use a second blueprint of your house it would use your junk to craft anything you were missing from storage
---
Wish events were opt in. THIS IS SANJAY HERE gets pretty damned old! 
---
Traveling pharmacy has been working for me
---
I'm on Xbox, but thanks.
---
hoard less
---
&gt; most of the players
---
!= most dupers
---
Yea, on pc, on their launcher.
---
I like the game, like some of the improvements. Not a big fan of the silent nerfs.
---
Unless power armor works different, going past 20 Int does not increase anything.
---
However, if you want to for funsies, the easiest way is to comb vendors for Berry Mentats(+5), and sugar bombs(only the version that causes rads) to make Brain Bombs food (+3), and then 5 pieces of Unyielding (+15), and then wear a Vault Suit upgraded to at least the third tier(+2). That’s 40 Int. 
---
FWIW to save time is just buy some Berry Mentats or pick up two pieces of Unyielding to get 20 Int, then craft a PA chest to see if the DR is 560. If it is, boom test confirms it. I have personally tested this effect on weapons only, this is why I’m not giving you a definite answer on this.
---
Well perception effects vats accuracy, agility action points and luck effects criticals, just not sure it's enough to warrant not going with extra defense
---
I think it's only shown if you have placed it once in the world. Not in the stash for sure and perhaps not in the inventory either. Definately not the latter if you just took it from the stash.
---
I'm at level 130 something at this point, and in my opinion the absolute worst thing about the story has been how the entire thing comes to a screeching halt because you have to fuck around forever and do all that stupid shit for that robot. 
---
The whole thing reeks of the writers being like school kids trying to rig the font size on their book report to make it seem longer than it is. Waste of time.
---
Tipping it over after you lock it
---
Have everyone join the same person's server via friends list.  Then you can all play together, just be aware that the game even solo is a pretty low difficulty so with 8 people roflstomping through a zone together it's gonna feel like Mike Tyson fighting a toddler.
---
If in a team yep. I regularly spam my friends with lawn flamingos just because I can.
---
It's not about folks disagreeing, it's that you fail to understand the basic concept. It doesn't matter if you had fun with the game, you were abusing a known exploit in an always online multiplayer game. 
---
He doesn't deserve a refund for breaking the rules and being punished for it, that's like expecting a refund of a concert ticket after being caught doing something illegal and getting thrown out of the venue.
---
This. I don't get why people put youtubers on the pedestal of "champions of gaming justice". The only thing they give a flying fuck about is making money from clicks, and fo76 became the ultimate clickbait for them to abuse
---
I’m on the launcher and I see “buy now” on fallout 2, is there somewhere else I should be looking?
---
Over killed her in under 3 minutes with them 50+ times. Nothing you say will change that fact, you should just stop the sad internet trolling and go do something productive with you time kid.
---
\^\^ This \^\^
---
So glad I found your post just so I know I was not going insane. This describes exactly the issue I am having with my C.A.M.P running out of build capacity, thousands of Tatos and other crops that I did eventually delete manually (my arthritis was not happy) after dumping as many into my build as I could cram in first. Only had in my case crops duplication, other items in *stored* haven't duplicated.
---
So this is a *crafting table* 'bug'? Hoping this has been fixed with the **Jan 10th Patch**, will have to wait and see. There was nothing about this issue in the patch notes.
---
Are those console games ?
---
I enjoyed what I played, but without some new content I've put it to the side.
---
I have them, but bought them from a trader, I do not know how he obtained them, (TBH i dont care lmfao, roleplaying as a trader this was very important to me :\] ) but what information besides how to obtain them, do you need?
---
Can ya'll please prioritise Scorchbeasts? At this point its a complete waste of time and resources to fight them. 
---
Sometimes they dont land at all, they dont have any cooldown on breath attack so they spam it nonstop, you cant see anything because of the attack. The rewards are not great either. 
---
I want to love this awesome enemy but at this point they are more annoying than terrifying. Thanks for the communication and work always
---
Thanks that's helpful, I'll do some experiments.
---
&gt; Fallout 76 is exactly how they told it was going to be.
---
Lol. It was marketed as a living-breathing world with 16x the detail of Fallout 4 and turned out to be the exact opposite.
---
Or, here's an idea, knowing that there is pvp in the game, don't hang out in areas specifically designed for pvp with gods half acre of shit in your bag.    
---
At a certain point "it's shame on me", and this is well beyond that point.   Of course it's entirely possible that he was acting like a loot pinata, because I doubt someone that high level is that dumb.  
---
\*Duplicating
---
Oof. I'm gonna have a *blast* farming for this this weekend...
---
I'm also going to have to farm for the BoS paint jobs.
---
Camps don't seem to be well optimized right now. My camp alone causes 15 FPS drop for me.
---
I believe you get them, but you'll need to play them on a PC.
---
It's not throwing a tantrum you overgrown man child, it's an expectation of quality. If you cannot wrap your Mountain Dew addled mind around that then we have nothing to discuss 
---
Huh, I mean, if it’s as easy as the three of you say, I wonder why they haven’t done it? 
---
Speaking as a solo player, you will get your money’s worth, but encounter frustrations that may or may not be addressed in the near future.
---
I'll check it out, thanks.
---
Yeah, I'm on PC. That's what I tried to do, but it wouldn't let me craft it. I'll try again sometime today.
---
I'm pretty sure it wasn't due to the explosive part of the stuff.
---
Please ban all Fallout 76 YouTubers, dupers or not, they're all toxic trash that have ruined this game
---
Unyielding gear gives +3special when low health/piece. 3x5 gear pieces = 15 extra special points across the board. The add mutations, underarmor, chems and it would be easy to go well over 30 INT
---
Cool.
---
It certainly does take forever. I wouldn’t mind if I had other main missions to do, but the two others that I have require me to do the Rose missions anyway.
---
I believe it was meant to be a mystery, although the whole "no human NPCs" thing gave it away. But I was half-convinced she was human or ghoul because of her sentience and zany personality. When you meet her for the first time, she says something along the line of "not what you expected, right?" implying that the writers intended to throw off players at first by making her seem human.
---
Yeah it would be cool to have at a workshop like that, would definately be hotly contested too
---
Story is a bit odd, because in in this time you destroyed the base and another character launched a nuke, and it launched and landed this is a pretty significant amount of time.  Like everyone should have died multiple times at least in PvP, and they had wanted they could have done the dup glitch multiple times.   The timer is around 1-4 minutes on the glitch so it would have been finished well in advance.  In any case if it was dup glitchers they didn't pickup the stuff because it had no value to them, they could just recreate it in another 2 minutes.  
---
This happened with the most recent patch for me. I had to quit the Bethesda launcher. Like quit by right clicking on the task bar icon and choosing quit. Then I launched it from my launcher directory `D:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda.net Launcher`
---
Yes, even more than that.
---
the amount of items that dupers carry are in the hundreds of thousands. they all use the weight glitch to get around. the only way a regular person would be considered to have a dupers amount of an item is if you were thousands above your carry weight at all times for weeks while u collected them, which isnt likely the case.
---
IMO weight glitch is just as bad as duping but they literally go hand in hand so fuck anyone who does either
---
Does bulking now actually reduce weight? It didn’t seem to at first?
---
But can you make a Hulk?
---
lol, All I want is a refund. I can't blame others for taking matters into their own hands when Bethesda stole their money.
---
They are really old school point and click games, not on console and won't really work without a mouse and keyboard.  
---
I'm sorry for all the cognitive dissonance being downvoted into Oblivion is evidently causing you. If it's helpful at all I'd like to reassure you that you are completely, objectively, wholly wrong.  But it's just a video game as you said, so you will likely be fine even if you can't come to terms with this and continue to live in your own reality.
---
me too! That's why my main feedback (response to them in the Inside the vault call for feedback) is a positive feedback / sort of review as to why the game captures me and my friends after a long period of no really good games and lots of almosts that circled drain till all fun was gone in the realm of online gaming.
---
It used to be where certain chems (stimpaks, super stims, diluted stims) wouldn't be affected by Travelling Pharmacy. I was wondering if that was fixed or changed. I may be misunderstanding your reply, I do that a lot.
---
I've seen some videos, seemed horrenduous.
---
I’ll check it out! Thanks for the tip. I’ll carve your name onto a super mutant(I get bored sometimes).
---
Sounds cool!
---
I got the Tricentenial edition for $30, and regret **nothing**!
---
I'm level 26, have 30 hours in, and haven't made it out of the general starting area of the map yet. I've already gotten my money's worth.
---
They seem to be finding their way to the Whitespring Resort a lot more these days too.  Becoming as common as gulls now.
---
Actually have this problem somewhat as a first-person heavy weapon player
---
Nuka paint is only for t51. Saying "power armor" is vague and even if someone wanted to help you they wouldn't know if they could because we dont know what armor you have.
---
I say perma ban for ***ANYONE*** who own duped items or know people with duped items. Ban everyone who unknowingly used duped items. Ban everyone who unknowingly used a glitch. 
---
Make sure you're logged in with the same account you used on your console. I installed them all yesterday and play in PS4. It gave me an install option from r 1, 2 and tactics without buying.
---
Can try updating or even uninstalling and re-install get the launcher if still not working or... Support ticket.
---
That’s right you only hear her voice until you reach the top of the world. 
---
You must not frequent the ammo depot much lol.  Maybe one out of ten encounters there DONT turn into a blood bath for us. We also occasionally have run ins at Charleston Landfill, Georges Junkyard, and Sunshine Meadows.
---
Good point. I do hope they pursue this direction of fair gaming. 
---
Real question what is 20 worth to you? 
---
Have spare scratch?  Blowing dosh on hookers and powder? Throwing 400 on casual drinks with the bros? 
---
Or, do you need that 20 to keep your car in fuel,  don't have enough food to make it to your next paycheck?  It's your child in tatters for cloths? 
---
Just messing with you,  Yeah the games worth 20 of you like fallout 4. Hell, it's worth 60 because a movie ticket is 15 dollars for 2 hours.  You can at least 20 hours of fun with quests and exploring. 
---
Damn I wish his settings weren’t private so I could have added him and thanked him, gravity_wins if you’re out there thank you 
---
I think there is an important distinction to make here.
---
The Devs are doing their best and trying to make the game the best it can be, and they are doing a good job for the most part.
---
Bethesda, the publisher, is horrible. All of the major decisions with this game beyond the Devs control is whats put it in the horrible spot its in.
---
But like you said, as long as Bethesda doesnt abandon it, it can only get better as time goes on.
---
But the argument most people will have is that it shouldnt have needed this long and this many fixes in the first place.
---
Gotcha lol, I do the same thing. But the perk has been working fine for me since I got it back in late November. I play on PS4 if that makes a difference. 
---
You're not really getting it.  It's not a crime, it's a game.  They're cheating in a game, and no one wants to play with them.
---
“I have an army”
---
“We have a hulk”
---
Risky click?
---
I use PA a lot, and I’m already missing that.
---
Bobblehead display case
---
Sure, but none of those directly increase your damage output, they are incidental bonuses.  I love having extra AP for dodgy but if I didn't get a 5% damage boost per point of STR I wouldn't bother with unyielding for melee.  For any bloodied/adrenal build staying alive and in the sweet spot is the name of the game.  I would take anything that directly improves defenses as long as it doesn't drop my damage below where I need it for current content.
---
Crap, good catch. I probably forgot to put it on there because it doesn't get nullified and you keep the full bonus! I've edited to reflect. Thanks!
---
No region locking, which led to the chinese playerbase banding together as one huge clan (iirc peaked at 1500 members) and they basically terrorised anyone non-chinese
---
I know, was trying to get a point across to the console friend.
---
I'd just prefer if they made bulking actually worth doing
---
In that situation the likely hood of him getting the kills is low, but the Tesla would jump enemy to enemy tagging more giving the XP. I'd still go with that even if he lands the lucky K.O. on some it would be outweighed by the XP he would gain.
---
Well, it could because... science? xD
---
Why would I post from a second account? To deceive you? I dont care about your opinion nearly enough for that. There are multiple discords and such to find groups of tae users for the queen and other events. The fact that you suggested that means that you likely do it to prove your points because no one else will stand with you on them. This is getting pathetic.
---
My wife and I played every day since the second beta session.
---
We loved every minute and put up with the constant disconnects, bugs, and issues.
---
We kept thinking that none of the bugs we had were major, we were able to do quests and didn’t seem to lose any items. The disconnects and the hoops to jump through to get back together were irritating but we only suffered once or twice per long play session.
---
We now haven’t played together in close to a month.
---
The last time we played we couldn’t seem to go more then 15 minutes without a disconnect. 
---
Once was during our first silo run with a friend. My wife got booted right towards the end and when she reconnected it spawned her outside the silo so she opted to not try and catch up since we were so far along.
---
Then the disconnects continued for all three of us during the nuke session, my friend couldn’t even loot anything at one point. I lost several items I had looted during this window too.
---
Then we went to do her cold case quest and apparently it’s bugged at the mailbox and she can’t advance the mission at all.
---
We haven’t logged back in together since, I’ve tried playing by myself but other then getting some loot and selling to all the vendors till they are out of caps there’s next to nothing worthwhile for me to do.
---
We are going to try again after this latest patch to see if somehow her mission works but I don’t hold out much hope...
---
Thanks for avoiding it, I only ever find the corpses of those "unruly golfer feral ghouls" I'm supposed to kill 7 of.
---
 You can get a combat helmet and paint it BoS to match. The one with the non-functional light on it. 
---
Sorry i forgot my faschnacht mask!
---
I don't know if you're just not aware, but SBs don't have an 'interesting search for you pattern', they already know you're there whether you're hidden or stealthed or inside a building. They spawn and amble towards you in a way that might make it appear they just found you, but you literally cannot successfully hide/stealth from them. The only way is to basically outrun them or get them engaged with npcs enemies or other players and get enough distance to fast travel or change servers.
---
Couldn't agree more
---
That's great but if I haven't heard of it how would I go looking for it? This question appeared on my scroll and it was the first one I've ever seen. Jeez why am I being hung up to dry for asking a simple question? I've never once said I was absolute awesome super pro gamer up to date on fallout everything. I've said the exact opposite, really, if you look through my comments in here. I've gotten lost, frustrated, and admitted I am extremely new at gaming in general and need advice. 
---
You shouldn't make a person feel stupid for just asking a question. The breeds fear of knowledge and that's what makes everything terrible. Everyone deserves a legitimate question answered if they don't know something. And now I know because OP explained. And due to this thread, I also know they're taking care of it by eliminating users that purposefully do it. Which is great. Double wammy of info!
---
Gotta make lemons before you can make lemonade
---
Sweet Jesus!
---
Bahahaha - have to say that's quite a story and glad you shared it with us.  Lock up the unwelcomed guest in the porta potty!
---
Most of the videos I’ve watched make it seem like they have never even played a fallout game. They literally say anything for views right or wrong. And regurgitate the same shit from the last 20 videos. If it’s wrong and they get bashed they just release another click bait video apologizing about it for more views. 
---
It's great to have hope for a game.
---
Games don't run companies though, push out products or offer you poor costumer service. Their refund policies are non existent, because they're games.
---
Now, BDS and Zenimax. They are companies, they push out product, yada yada. To me, they are doing the absolute bare minimum and getting praised for it.
---
While I will thank the programmers, artist and staff for pumping out updates. I do not and will not condone many of the actions or lack there of that BGS/Zenimax has taken up to this point. 
---
I’ve done it twice now in 2 weeks, but it’s deffo glitchy
---
oh yea that totally explain why and how some mobs manage to get a prototype jetpack for the xo1 totally dude
---
To establish the TSE community dude.
---
I paid for the game and can't get a refund, might as well make a point of showing my unhappiness until Bethesda sends me a refund. 
---
I'm only the consequence of Bethesda's greed and stupidity, not the cause.
---
What system are you on. Why not add him as a friend?
---
Same here. Hung up during a queen fight this morning for 10 or 15s, but didn't drop. Lucky.
---
I feel its mostly cause people don't play early on versions of mmo's or sandboxes 
---
I've played a.... ok lets say unnatural amount of online sandboxes and while this game had some weird bugs it wasn't the worse (looks at ark and atlas)
---

I keep thinking the Mire should be the next place I drop a camp at.
---
Bloated is a sub-type. Like a chameleon deathclaw.
---
Oh, ok. It used to not work so I think I set it aside for some other perks. Ok.
---
Yeah, I'm disappointed in the state of the game, as released, but I have to give them credit for working hard to fix things. Plus, despite all the bugs, it was still very playable, and I'd be lying if I said that I haven't had fun in the past few months getting my toon to level 80.
---
Oh that’s a good idea!
---
Awesome!!! I didn't notice that it wasn't working this whole time! I can't wait for the patch to come for PS4! :D
---
This got downvoted, 5 months ago, but ended up being true now.  Those fools who downvoted must feel really dumb right about now.  Cause this is exactly whats happening.
---

Bulking lead and aluminum actually reduces weight. Most other things it's a break even.
---
Hold out on hope, some pointers I can give on the paint job is to only submit 1 Tech Data at a time and go to the Whitespring Bunker's military wing for farming data. I read on here that some people believe you need to submit more than 1 to get better rewards like the paint job but I got mine and a few others off of only 1 piece of data. Good luck on the grind!
---
So, where are the non-chinese clans ?
---
Because this is top 10 “disappointing.” I enjoyed the game for a month or so but I would be lying if I said it wasn’t a huge disappointment.
---
Well, computers don't mind doing those sorts of tasks, friend.
---
Eventually a marker will appear on the map and you just go there and steal whatever items are in the box that it tags. Could be something as simple as grenades.
---
If you see the marker but you don't go there and log back in later the marker might move to a different Super Mutant camp, it's random.
---
Yeah,  it's not bad,  though it can be a bit gloomy. I don't get attacked by a lot of enemies, just the occasional single scorched or wild dog.
---
After January 10 update game feels choppy. Specially when I’m rotating with my character. It’s like a frame drop for a half second = not experiencing that kind of smoothness when moving with character like before. On the previous version that wasn’t a problem at all.

+game is on lower settings, so it won’t be fixed with adjustment of that settings...
---
I can. They game shouldn’t have been shipped in this state. Down vote all you want. The game is buggy and not even Bethesda buggy. The we have your money and will fix later buggy. 
---
This would be amazing for a DLC piece.

This. I think it was SkillUp who said "i've played it for like a few hours and know everything i need to to call it the worst game of 2018". In the same video he stated "i don't care about the graphics, but..." and went on a long ass rant about the graphics.
---
And this is a guy who defended The Division for most of Year 1
---
Or when the world go back the soda industry will experience a boom! Then people will be in need of used bottlecaps cuz of lack of resourses and then we ll see whos laughing!
---
 Probably all the dupers... 
---
I mean, realistically you only need to carry around 20-30 bobby pins.  Anything over that is just overkill.
---
I put serious consideration into duping screws because it's now the reason I don't play anymore, but I dont have friends to dupe with lol.
---
So far I couldn't find the second one, even after dozens of server hopping.
---
Ah I never have much of those anyway as I’m constantly using them. I seem to have shitloads of steel which I always end up dumping.
---
I’m loving it for the most part. I really can’t stand the frustrating frame rate drops to borderline unplayable 15fps or so. 
---
But it makes me happy that they’re working on it :)
---
Oh well, shouldn't have done it in the first place.
---
I like the idea of a hunting game, I think theres a minor quest involving it, but server wide hunt that isn't based at a predetermined location might be nice.  As for fishing, its somewhat of a dying (dead) world.  I don't think fishing would help with the immersion much.   The shooting range would be fun, there are a few obstacle course type of quests (one has target practice) that might hold you over.
---
I couldn't agree more! 
---
I'm hooked even with the bugs. And yes they are trying.
---
I do feel however Xmas and New years holiday's should have been postponed or canceled, so that we might be a bit farther along in the fixes. 🤣
---
Yes to all the content of this comment.
---
And we’re doing a damn good job, I’ll have you know.
---
Different ingredients, same effect.
---
Love it! More than 3 CAMPS within a certain distance should have a "shantytown" marker and maybe become a spawn point for the traveling vendors. 
---
Also the King Rancho parade.
---
Why is your neck glowing red? 
---
As we were heading back to finish a quest, we discovered at 12:03 that they do expire. Ugh. We were probably five to ten minutes too slow. 
---
Honestly I've had to stop playing due to frustration. I've lost too many items to server crashes. I will keep on eye on it and hopefully it improves to the point where I can play without losing progress or items.
---
I agree. ESO absolutely feels like what a multiplayer ESO game should feel like.  People should understand that in order for things to work as an MMO, you need to make some adjustments from single player. But every time I played ESO, it felt like a pretty massive version of any Elder Scrolls games.  I think often times these days, gamers suffer from the "It's not exactly what \*I\* wanted, ipso facto it's not what it should be".
---
Asshats will always try stuff like this, and eventually just like duping they'll figure out another way.
---
Just never trade with rando's. 
---
There's a Wasteland Support group you might want to consider.
---
Hoarders Anonymous. 
---
or HA!
---
Does this work? 
---
Cool, cool, grats.
---
That mission actually does work now. 
---
In terms of quests, i'd say they have fixed the majority of problems with those which is great. 
---
They still have so much to fix though. quite a few major issues and a lot of minor ones. 
---
It seems they are just slowly chiseling away at the problems. 
---
And you help prove my point. People will stop playing more and more. 
---
I hope they can turn this game around within the next few months. 
---
It should not take a year to fix what needs to be fixed. 
---
Sure, the game will always need tweaks, but some stuff needs to be just flat out changed, not tweaked. 
---
Thanks! I got the Initiate Paint job and Bomber jacket so far.
---
&gt; perfectly acceptable in the game
---
Yet they got banned for it...
---
Yup. Sacrifice some perk slots for easier looting. I didn’t want to ask for the preserved pie in the sky.
---
There isn't any good way to run 9 people together at once. What I would do is break you down into 3 or 4 groups of mostly-equal abilities and/or goals and/or levels. Then have each individual group run together. I wouldn't even try to get all 9 people into a single discord communication because when the s&amp;*^ hits the fan, that's too many people to coordinate effectively.
---
But! When your most advanced group gets ready to launch a nuke, that's when all 9 of you ensure you're on the same server. Whether you're rotating between the 3-4 main spawn points at Whitespring or whether you're all working together on the SBQ, that's the time to get everyone all working together.
---
I mean, think about some of those smaller locations, like the abandoned bunker. Having 3-4 people in there works, but 9? No way in hell. It'd be clunky and a good number of people would feel unneeded, in the way, or otherwise useless.
---
You can get a full set of ultracite from the BOS quest line and the x-01 prototype plans from the enclave bunker once youve completed those quests. 
---
The thing with NMS is it was a high profile indie game the studio could afford to keep working on for years after release even though it flopped hard. I’m not sure Bethesda has that luxury to the extent that would be needed to “fix” it.
---
All i can remember from the video is hitting trees with bare hands with a horrible stiff animation then being chased to death by a parrot.
---
Right, but it doesn’t restock it for other players.

Still can't get into this game. To each their own.
---
It is good, it just isnt "Fallout 5"
---
It is fallout online essentially, which is why it got a lot of initial hate. It's not supposed to be a full sequel with brand new everything, it builds off mechanics from FO4 and brings them into a setting where you can play with friends.
---
I never really understood why people hate on this game. Bethesda is trying their best to give the community what they want to improve the experience in game. I'm hoping that I'm not the only one that agrees with you.
---
Yes because no one has experienced any real issues with the game, it is all down to youtubers 
---
I get your general point but I think it is a balance and your comment just dismisses everyone with real criticism.  The game wasn't ready at release but it is a good game and at least they are fixing it... Thanking them for the right things, not throwing out praise needlessly or dismissing those who are unhappy.  We certainly shouldn't be thanking them for rushing for a Xmas release and the false marketing. 
---
My reason for thinking it wasn't ready for release is purely down to the server issues. You want to release an online only game? Make sure your servers are robust, maybe with a completely open BETA months before release. Other bugs I can live with until they get round to patching but if I keep getting kicked out of server multiple times an hour then I am not going to get to the good parts of the game and ruins the immersion that Bethesda do so well in their universes. 
---
Alrighty then. Good luck, let me know if it works for you
---
I am afraid the issue seems to be more complicated then "just" the mutations.  Sometimes the perks work, sometimes they do.   Stats are changing all the time, especially STR.  with radicool, foodbuffs,  daytime/nightime.       for a few minutes, both perks were working fine for me even with class freak 3.  now they are back to doing nothing again until i swap out classfreak.      and even then, berserker only added 28 physical protection 
---
It is definitly tied to some math with the mutations. but something is really wonky here.
---
 You getting upset about that quest means it's working as intended. Rose is a raider and raiders aren't nice. They make dance for them in the hopes of getting what they promise only to try and slit your throat in the end. She just happens to be lonely and gets a little attached in the end. I was kind of hoping to be forced to join her or fight her even if it meant fighting some beasts or bots she had hidden away such as on the second level somewhere. Sending you down to "fetch something" like your prize for helping just to be fucked over. 
---
Last two patches had made my game buggier and less stable so no.
---
I have lost all faith in them which is unfortunate with ES6 coming in the next few years. Fallout 76 could have taken 2 more years in production they show with every move that they don't care if you like what they have to sell as long as you buy it. 
---
It's Space Magic
---
Lets have an argument about that.
---
They do not post the player count, no mmo really does
---
I might get the game again just to help kill the queen as a lvl 30 badass 
---
I've only grabbed it about 10 times in the last two-three weeks.  I think there was a nerf of workshops on the Dec patch - and since then all the workshops seem to be open most of the time.
---
So this may be that since I only discovered that workshop after the nerf, that's why I've not had any encounters there.
---
I didn’t even bother playing the mutation roulette game until I had Class Freak 3. At least then the somewhat crappy mutations aren’t as noticeable. Thankfully I lucked out not getting empathy. The positives of the awesome ones like marsupial and speed demon outweighs the reduced negatives with max Class Freak.
---
Maybe hand all but one to a friend and turn them in one by one?
---
Nope, I'm saying I can see how someone can justify it. Bethesda stole their money, so they feel justified in ruining others play to help lower the return rate of the game.
---
The hatred comes from antisocial people feeling betrayed that they are now forced to interact with rest of society 
---
You put any points in luck?
---
Good, I mean your cheating and making videos of it...What did you expect?
---
Here's a tip : travel to Whitespring, find the sulphur spring, it will heal your diseases for free.
---
Right!  I made it to level 7 this game sucks! Saw that a lot the first couple days. 
---
Then you have the ones like juicehead. THIS GAME SUCKS, FO76 Worst game ever, Done with 76, but is level 130 and stilllll playing.
---
You think they're gonna make a fallout 5?
---
this way they will increase sales.
---
We will see you in ES6, pal.
---
Wow that was a looks a lot more disorganized than how I wrote it in a list, is that fine or is there somewhere I can post this without it looking like a complete mess?
---
They weren't at their base. And I don't have or use a mic. Also I didn't completely wreck their base, just a wall. Like 1 wood to repair or something.
---
Interesting, I just looked back and you're correct. My guess is it was changed from what I wrote (I grabbed it minutes after it went up) to what you wrote. I'm not motivated to find an archived page lol. 5k -&gt; 25k is great, but 25k is still a silly limit (on trades and on max character caps). I'm sitting on 5 characters with 120k (125 is absolute max) and it's ridiculous.
---
I'm psyched about these fixes. Great patch! Things are heading in a more balanced direction and I hope the anti-duping measure fixes server stability so that we can soon benefit from another Stash increase.
---
It's been brought up I think, but there is a massive QoL fix that needs to be implemented and hopefully we see it in the next Jan patch.
---
Plans. Please Bethesda, tell us you are including a way for us to see what plans and recipes we already own. Just...put a little check mark in front of it in the vendor menu if we've learned it. Maybe add a section in Data of our Pip-Boy where we can view the list as well. 
---
Also, I felt compelled to agree with others that we need a rifle weight reduction perk. It flat out makes no sense that there isn't one and rifles in general weigh too much as it is.
---
And this is just a minor woe (at the moment) but you want us to buy more things from the Atom shop yeah? Well, I'd be more inclined to do that if I had more budget to place those things. As you put out more deco, there's just going to be less space. I don't want to have to make one cool thing obsolete so I can place another cool thing. Even a 10% increase would be great.
---
tried dropping them into a paper bag and then picking them up?
---
Create the bag first with 1 ammo, then drop in 1 tech data, pick it up hand it in, repeat.
---
Ok, so you're saying that just because *someone* didn't have fun with the game, it's ok to make sure *others* don't have fun with the game?
---
What the shit kinda logic is that?
---
Oh, nice. Maybe having the perk equipped gives you a chance to acquire a misc item that is used to craft the mounting? I’d also like it if they treated these like food recipes, where you learn the plan for it upon acquiring the item needed for it. I mean you already have the perk, that’s the knowledge needed to make it right there.
---
I think 1000 would be perfect for the game. It's a good amount but not too much.
---
Pvp zone? The entire map is a "pvp" zone
---
They are crunching data for the next patch
---
I still know him lol.
---
I wouldn't have bought it if I had know what it was going to be.
---
The games not worth fixing to me, just give me back my money and call it a day.
---
I won't argue with you because you're exactly right. 
---
Capture workshops, each time you take one you get a plan, and also defend workshops, each time you defend one you get a plan
---
 There's a lot of junk items that you simply don't need to hang on to more than 50-100 of: 
---
* Aluminum 
---
*  Antiseptic
---
*  Abestos
---
*  Black Titanium
---
*  Ceramic
---
*  Circuitry
---
*  Concrete
---
*  Copper Cork
---
*  Crystal
---
*  Fiber Optics
---
*  Gold
---
*  Nuclear Material
---
*  Oil
---
*  Rubber
---
* Silver
---
 All of these are used in various items, but nothing you'll be needing  24/7.  A small stockpile of 50-100 should be more than sufficient for  anybody.  Don't hoard it. Bulk it and sell it.
---
And things like Steel, Wood, Lead, and Gunpowder have the tendecy to  really stack up in inventory, and they start to weigh a ton. But all are  also easily found...but there's no reason you should have hundreds or  thousands of anything in your Stash. 
---
And then people who genuinely like the game, like Oxhorn, get a world of shit for not only streaming the game, but having the nerve to genuinely enjoy it. From his own fanbase
---
I love that they are working week over week to fix issues with the game and change/balance what needs to be done BUT I really hope that they add new content within the next 3-60 days. I feel like this is the only way to get those of us who love/like the game to keep playing it. 
---
Every play DayZ? the players did nothing but bitch and moan about night time servers. 
---
It's a collar from the Prison.
---
Make it like the CMF, a scrapyard workshop you can set to slowly convert junk into other junk, give it the munitions factory value
---
I've never heard of games being refunded after players have had some time with them. You should've known the game had bugs coming in. 
---
I'm half tempted to continue as though we're miscommunicating because you seem so worked up about it, but instead I'll just say what should have been said in the first place 
---
"oh lol, I meant the regular glowing ones, not regular ghouls."
---
"Oh, I'm with you. That makes way more sense and seems like a perfectly reasonable question. My bad."
---
Did you buy the game on reddit ?
---
That was already a feature.  Hold z to go left, c to go right.  It stopped at 0.  If you want max, hold c.  This is for sure a bug..  It works for trading too where you specify how much to sell for.  It wraps around to 25k, bypassing the 5k limit.
---
I couldn't agree more. I said this when the Slap System was announced.  PvP/PvE servers are needed as well as PERMANENT servers (ideally an increase to the population per server would accompany this change).  If you spend even 30 seconds considering this, the reasons are obvious.  Server permanence would allow those players who focus on crafting/trading to establish their 'brand' as well as their C.A.M.P. as a trading post on their respective server.  This could lead to the creation of an IN GAME ECONOMY (versus Duper's Market--AKA fo76 Marketplace).  Additionally, players would be able to develop reputations (e.g. helpers, raiders, etc) and groups would naturally form.  None of that exist now, which leaves alot to be desired--certainly at the end game.  Just my 2 caps.

I’m just saying this to be the devils advocate but I think most people are mad because they didn’t try hard enough until it started effecting their wallet, they thought they could release an unfinished and buggy game like they always do and people would just accept it like they always do but when the community started getting pissed and sales started going down *that’s* when they decided to take action
---
I am honestly so sick of all this pitchfork sharpening over dupers. Like i get that it sucks, but as soon as you have 5 bobby pins you become labeled a Durty Dupah!1. Whenever someone derails a topic to duping i just picture that episode of South Park with the cable CEO guy rubbing his nipples and talking calmly into the camera.
---
It already worked when trading.  Hold z to go left and it stopped at 0.  This is a new bug.
---
Why wouldnt they? Single player games are their strength but that shit takes them YEARS. 
---
They have 2 major games coming before that, but OF COURSE there will be a fallout 5 eventually.
---
Idk how I’ve yet to come across him until yesterday as I’m level 68. Wish I could check him out somewhere not so crazy lol.
---
I bought the game off of what head employees of Bethesda said about the game. Seems they lied so yeah that's stealing. False advertisement is a thing. We will give you this. When you get it, it's not even close to what they said. Seems like a valid reason to complain.
---
But, 
---
It will take the dupers awhile to find another way, and they won’t be sharing on YouTube to grow their fan base when they realize Bethesda could be looking for them, there. 👍
---
Thanks you very much.
---
Nice little camp btw
---
I got the initiate paint several days ago. I still haven't seen the Knight paint. Now I just need anyone to prove to me the shielded raider lining actually exists.
---
You think fallout 76 is a decent buy?
---
It's like a subconscious thing, y'know, like I see that desk fan and I just gotta grab it, while I'm at it I might as well grab that aluminium canister, oh, and that gas canister, and that blowtorch, how about this tin can, sooooo many tin cans, what about that wrench, that screwdriver. And then I've cleared out the entire room, but I need more, I travel all the way to Watoga and commit mass murder against some robots because I'm addicted to collecting steel, oh God man I need help
---
Isn't it a budget issue though if you can't delete them?
---
And wreck the in game economy
---
That's not how refunds work, you don't just get your money back because you didn't like the product.
---
You bought something, didn't like it, fair enough. Time to move on.
---
YouTube is insidious. It feeds on clickbait and trendy topics. People *want* to hate on FO76 because of its problems; instead of moving on with their lives and playing something else, they find themselves on YouTube having their feelings validated by people paid to make reviews and content their viewers want to see. So the cycle of criticism churns onward, and as a fan of the Destiny franchise, I can tell you that it won't stop - even after the major issues are addressed.
---
I don't watch YouTube or streamers on Twitch or any of that nonsense because that's what it is - nonsense. People blasting their opinions to the world because its the popular thing to do, and to stay relevant you have to tap into the thoughts of your viewers, even to the point of idiocy. It is such a waste of time. 
---
Yeah it was z and c for PC.  We don't have bumpers/triggers though.. so that's our only option.  It used to stop at 0.  Not sure why i'd want to wrap it around.
---
You remind me of the people that complain about losing their house to a tornado, in Tornado Alley.
---
The Red Rocket at Morgantown is a nice prebuilt location
---
 Good luck i think the window for no questions asked refund is over.  
---
I also play 99.5% Lone Wanderer, and I'm having a blast. I do wish there were more of a faction thing going on--I was bummed to rise through the ranks of the Order of Mysteries only to be DONE. I'm hoping in the future I can log into Cryptos for Order-specific quests.
---
Really the only thing bumming me out about the game are the various C.A.M.P glitches, so hopefully the January patches take care of those.
---
Just keep going into stored and delete the dupes.
---
i know this game is all about people and parties and charisma perks and shit but i've been solo for most of it and i prefer to be solo. you can take your time looking at everything and reading all the entries. you dont have to wait around for people. you dont have to make sure everyone gets their dmg in before killing a monster and all world loot is yours without feeling guilty for taking it first.
---
it probably didnt help that the only people i ever played with were way behind me in progress and i was basically just taxi'ing them around the map and waiting for them to be done with the quest before carrying them to the next thing
---
50 is enough, when you start making fluxes and find some good weapons, can't afford more space.
---
I have the Str perk to reduce chem weight, the Str perk that increases swing speed but also reduces melee weapon weight, the Int perk that reduces energy ammo weight (and fusion cores), and the Agility perk that reduces food weight.
---
Yes but I'm a "hardcore" player who plays daily so I may be biased
---
I turned all mine in at once. Don't do that. Turn em in at least 2 at a time. Have a friend hold onto the extras and hand them to you. 
---
After thee first turn in .. both go to Military wing of enclave and check desks. Find one or two and turn em in before searching for more. 
---
Oh no. 100 caps for 2 100% cores 
---
This assumes listening to the player base brings players back.
---
No one said they woulnd't tried, but it's a fact that developers publish games earlier before they are finished, to promote with "updates" that should be in the base game from the beginning. It's marketing really. We can't just picture us some nice people working hard in front of a pc and then forgive. They aren't stupid. The state of fallout 76 release wasn't an accident.
---
Ps4, I tried and he was set to private so the request wouldn’t go through
---
 Hi. Sorry, but, where is that camp location?! 
---
Um, what? Worked up. Maybe you're the one whose reading far too much into it. I'm not upset in the slightest.
---
You seem to be either NOT reading what it is I wrote, you're not being clear enough or we're both not concerned about what the other is saying we're just spouting shit aloud. All seem reasonable from where I stand.
---
You've not really answered anything minus the first time when you posted what Jucie said.
---
Chameleon death claws give more exp than a regular death claw, these things. Much like an Alpha or Glowing verison does. They do not give out the same xp values.
---
Now if you're saying all "glowing" ghouls do? Fine. State that "Reguardless of type they all give the same exp" or "They all had their values lowered because the bloated one is a sub type". 
---
Instead you went the pompous route in your last post attempting to be some "big man" verus clearly communicating your point. So I suggest either stopping, dropping this conversation much like I am as you'll be blocked. Move on with your day cause you're not helping anyone here.
---
Can someone get to the root of the generally tight-arsed attitude to rewards and trades in this game?  I'm convinced that there is some twisted little human, full of spite, who hates gamers, making these type of decisions. It fits in clearly with the Atomic Shop crap, the stash-box size. The weight-related Perk cards which do NOTHING.  
---
Another basic example is, I ran out of gun-powder and tried to buy some .44 ammo. They charged 7 caps for 1 bullet, then the vender only had one cap for me to trade back so I couldn't trade stuff to get my caps back. Really?
---
Also, it's clear that they can't give away the Work-shops because they charge too much for them.  I raised the fact that 29 caps was too much so they've raised the price to 39 then 75!! for some of them, knowing that people lose their caps and stuff they built when they are kicked off the server and leave and someone else steals it. Someone at Bethesda is obviously either 'a few caps short of the stash' mentally, or they're deliberately trying to piss off users. Maybe they want the value of Bethesda to tank so they can buy it cheap. 
---
Now this latest paultry update does not raise the stash limit, though everyone's been screaming for this. -Shakes head-. They must be determined to kill this game.  
---
Wanted to be a raider , eh ?
---
That's weird, because in an interview a year ago, they specifically talked about how many active monthly players they had.../shrug

---
I think there are mods for this but yeah, now that we have a hard limit I'd love Beth for making it easier to see what tabs are heaviest. 
---
You realize there's a lot of these "main" quests, and not ***A*** main quest, right?
---
Also I forgot to revise the list before I posted it, I tagged the jet pack at 1096 but must have missed 3 others from the master counter. If I add all the mods I recorded past 200 it adds to 899 so it should be &lt;1099&gt;. I edited the list to correct it.
---
But he was making it less fun for.other please. It is just a game, but it is a multiplayer game.  His actions affect others. He is 1 player affecting unknown number of other players.  They lost enjoyment, he should lose something to. Cheating affects other people.
---
whitespring vendor, may have to server hop for it to spawn
---
Well that's a very different explanation than "people sneaking don't show up on the map".
---
They are, I’m sure they feel bad about all the negativity. They are trying 🙌🏻
---
It's an old first person shooter model thing so that more of the weapon model is visible to the player. See Counter Strike 
---
I'm gonna be 100% honest and say this reminds me a LOT of when NMS came out... So much promise and so much hope and like nothing worked... I wasn't there from day 1 of NMS because I don't have a PS4 but I have plenty of friends and family that were and some that stuck it out in hopes that every week got a little better.
---
I then picked it up when they had their big patch earlier in 2018 when it came out for PC and XB1. The game felt like an actual game by then and had had so much work done to help it. Now it's a pretty damn awesome game! I've collected awesome ships and ground vehicles, they've expanded planet types and have massive oceans to explore with huge sea creatures and building bases has gotten exponentially better! So much progress from Hello Games.
---
I'm really hoping Bethesda continues to really listen to us fans because there are great building blocks in place in this game and I'm having a blast, despite all the duping and such. I've finally spent some real time on my CAMP and have it just about maxed, tho I wish I could do so much more with it LOL! I have a lot of hope tho and I've seen some progress here and there and I really just hope they don't lose momentum at all and keep up the improvements. I am forever optimistic about the game and this patch from yesterday has given me a lot of hope if for nothing else, the bobby pin weight and the finally added Legendary Hunting Rifles!!!! I can't wait for this patch to come to XB1 so I can farm for a Legendary Hunting Rifle!!! I'm so excited!!! 
---
Thanks!
---
Both launches were rough, but I had zero fun while playing Atlas. I enjoy fallout 76 a lot. 
---
That's the point.  You \*\*\*won't\*\*\* need it, but it's stopping you from collecting stuff you \*\*\*DO\*\*\* need. :)
---
leave in game to area and use discord for teams/everything else. flip between them when you need them. 
---
If your on console unfortunately party chat cuts all in game chat to one or the other on xbox. cant speak for ps4
---
If you have a power armor paint job from the Atom Store you can kinda do that.  Painting a part with a paint job from the Atom Store will mark the frame.  That's what clued me into this potential solution.
---
That said, people shouldn't have to buy a power armor paint job from the armor store to be able to identify their favorite power armor set in inventory screens.
---
Yes they are dealing with the SYMPTOMS of cheating with the TOS, but seem to be masking the root cause of SELLING DEFECTIVE PRODUCT behind that as well.
---
I dislike cheats and exploiters, but I also dislike defective products being sold.
---
Not sure who will buy all those left leather legs.
---
Oooh, lookit the fancy college man, toating his fancy college equipment.  They should name a snack after ya.
---
Oh yeah, fancy lads.
---
Won't see me stepping into Satan's temple, worshipping numbers and "philosophy"
---
Bah!  Bah I say!
---
How much does the sarcasm attire cost in the atom store? Because I would *totally* buy it.
---
/r/iamverybadass
---
On number 1... number 3... third number 1.  FO4 had those stairs with attached 1/4 floor blocks.  Those would be perfect to both let us use stairs on an edge and have them in the middle of a floor.  Of course you still can't use atom shop skins on 1/4 or 1/2 floors.. and there's no 1/4 or 1/2 foundation.
---
Right, and t45d was another common suit, or common enough since the Capital Wasteland BoS used that model as their standard armor.
---
Is that an unmarked location that would allow a camp?
---
&gt; - ** Watoga High School
---
FYI, you can also take the stairs on the side of the High school to roof.
---
This is been happening to me since the full launch, I don’t know if this will work for y’all but I reset my router if I get a disconnect and I don’t have problems after.
---
Good riddance
---
dupers arent overencumbered so they are still using it or whatever replaced it. u cant overload stash so they have to carry it all on their person
---
I'm definitely interested to see your logs on what he sells, if you get a chance.
---
Yea, it allows you to build a camp there
---
OP mentioned weapons and be amazed who will buy what.
---
Never had troubles but ive heard people talk about laggy servers causing it
---
this shill posts are amazing. is like 80% of this sub bethesda employees?
---
i always read here that you need the starched jeans /s
---
When it comes to your problem it sounds like more of a hardware issue than a game issue.
---
What are your specs? If you're on PC. What resolution and detail do you play on and have you tried making a cosutom .ini?
---
If you're on the xbox or ps4 there is not much I can attempt to advise you on to help :(.
---
I guess I have to get back at it. I've gotten all the T-series calibrated shocks plans and the T-51 jetpack, but the T-60 jetpack still eludes me.
---
I would be afraid of losing all my junk, honestly ? 
---
Damn, i threw away tons of those
---
I dont much pay attention to fallout lore, i just like being an evil bastard. But arent there multiple inconsistencies with the lore that people noticed before the game even launched? Such as the brotherhood of steel not existing in West Virginia for another hundred years or something?
---
Yep. Same goes for anyone who bought one of their duped items.  Anyone who has their duped shit is a beneficiary of cheating and is helping to break the game. 
---
most vendors are not instanced for all players so that is why first come first serve
---
Your right. I hate it when I disconnect likely due to duping... Im not going to argure further though. Forget reddit
---
Rad x can suppress them for a time, but won't remove.
---
Did you pop any of that x?
---
 I never said anything about others not being able to like the game. I only pointed out the useless praise some are giving to Bethesda for minor patches when there are in fact numerous game breaking bugs still in the game. And the reason I care is that this praising and ass licking to bethesda only proves them right in releasing garbage products priced at 60 euro + MTX and get away with it. It's the main reason we are where we are in the game industry.
---
I’ve seen players wanting to buy wood on there
---
I agree that 76 has a certain "something" that makes it profoundly immersive... to a point, at least.  I think it has to do with how the game is constant.  The lunging Deathclaw doesn't stop moving just because you bring up your Pip-Boy.  There are often multiple things vying for your attention - sometimes you hear another player involved in a battle and you go check it out.
---
And while I wouldn't say no to human NPCs... there is something about that too.  Knowing there isn't a friendly face, that you're all alone in the forest at night, that you can never confront the evil men who destroyed Appalachia.  I think a lot of people come to games like this expecting to play God and pass moral judgement on everyone, but here, you are just an ordinary person initially trying to survive, then thrive, in a hostile wasteland.
---
I usually drop them in the Flatwoods overseer cache too. I always wondered though if the items persist once I log off. Anyone tested this?
---
You think 8 TSE is an average?  For how much game time?  1000 hours?
---
^but ^my ^junk
---
I'm sure they have people watching the Reddit markets as well. So pretty much anyone who is a regular seller should expect that their account is going to be reviewed. 
---
Most of the duping exploits have easy to find evidence by reviewing account activity. 
---
Ive been having problems in pvp where it enters and exits the pip boy making it impossible to shoot use vats all i can do is move as well as not being able to open map or pip boy also power armor sometimes glitches says im in power armor but cant exit and leaves me in normal veiw mode with no resistances. 
---
I've stopped using Radaway and to degree purified water. I live on Nuka Cherry, chugging it like healing potions.
---
I’ll start checking I’ve got quite a few
---
Haha for real ?
---
That's because there is nothing else for them to do.  The leveling rate is slower than fallout 4 but it doesn't have real quests or NPCs to interact with
---
I replied to u/Aerokii here with my list but reddit wouldn't let me keep the format I wrote it in so it's pretty disorganized looking. He's going to try to format it.
---
Yeah.  Making it a "survival" game where you had to eat/drink every 30 minutes or so, yet it takes 10 .308 rounds to bring down a critter...  The most unrealistic part in the game is the ammo.  Most people would be hard pressed to carry 6 30-round .308 mags and be able to carry much more.  Carrying 1000 rounds of anything around, let alone for 2 or 3 guns. Right!
---
Worth mentioning, if you try to open a locked door in a workshop that was locked by another player, you will get a wanted status and no warning. Even in pacifist mode. 
---
I found out the hardware trying to open a door to get outside a workshop.
---
This is such a painfully true statement.

Haven't seen many dupers myself, only one, he was hanging around vault 76 with his posse, wanted my shotgun. 😂 and now that you say it, he wasn't overcumbered.. hmmmm..
---
Enclave Charleston herald 
---
Yes. Burn it. BURN IT ALL!
---
Look I dont think anyone actually thought the game was gunna get abandoned and if people actually thought that then they are stupid hands down. The overall launch of FO76 was completely and utterly pathetic and that's what everyone has a problem with they launched it in a completely unacceptable state and this is not their first online game ESO and their launch with that was pathetic as well so it goes to show they have learned nothing as a company. While I know for a fact the game will be what we all hoped eventually but so many people have already duped, Cheated and exploited in this "multiplayer game" and nothing has been said or done with it. Not only that but they have also screwed over the community a number of times with the nylon bags the players information leak. So overall Bethesda has lost a lot of trust from its community but it won't matter because we all still love Bethesda's work and will cave in and buy what they come out with so I digress and simply hope their next release is better.
---
Banning will do nothing... unless they ban absolutely anyone who duped anything and remove duped weapons. I still enjoy the game quite a bit and fortunately I do not play fallout for balance or for competition. I was hoping for a diverse economy but honestly I would be mind blow if that ever blossoms now.
---
The glitch going on for so long has ruined both PvP (this was shit before the guns) and the economy of the game and could be fixed in a pretty easy way. Up the gun levels. Nothing will ever be fair until Bethesda makes a move to deal with the stuff that is currently out there. They know what caused the glitch and should be easy to track anyone who did it. That should be the first ban wave. Once those players are banned, they need to remove duped guns or raise the level of guns for it to balance out eventually. If they do not do one or the other a competitive or interesting multiplayer will never evolve. If there are people out there with hoards of mule characters with best in slot weapons there will always  be an imbalance. Only Bethesda can take steps to fix it and it should be swift and firm.
---
Much better thanks!
---
this is about exactly where i'm at.  I have a storage alt i keep the ones i'm not using on.  Never found a TSE, just two-shot or explosive.  I do have a bloodied explosive combat rifle though I got quite early on.  I feel like 3 star weapons had a better drop rate back then.
---
I dislike cheats and exploiters, but I also dislike defective products being sold to me.
---
lol sure they did....
---
Yeap. Loving the effort, and still enjoying the game.  
---
I still remember No Man's Sky, so there is always hope if the company is willing to put in the effort.   
---
I don't feel like I should be thanking them. They certainly messed up the release to the point where the game wasn't worth 60$. The game is a live service and they will support it for many years. It's only logical to improve it to keep the player base engaged and attract more players. I only feel sorry for the developers. But no-one owes Bethesda any gratitude, in fact they owe us. If you ordered a dish at a good restaurant and it came badly cooked they are obliged to serve you another. 
---
You need rank 2 of the perk
---
I'd also like to find the raiders version of protective.
---
I think all duped items should be wiped from the game.  If the dupers are banned but the fruits of their labor remains then the game is still seriously broken. 
---
Nah no x, and since I lost the first mutation I can’t seem to get another one I was fully rad down to a little health twice and got nothing 
---
Can't wait for player vending to be in the game, i'm ready to sell ivory grips and explosive vents !
---
I’m curious about that too.. I do know the govt air drops will stay at least as long as your in the server. Me and another dude offloaded a bunch of stuff once and I went and scouted for a new camp spot...built my camp... then wandered back over just to see if it would still be there.. it was and so was all the items lol
---
I'm a little up the road by the flagpole. Water source, great for fast travel to the east part of the map and whitesprings, some wild plant ingredients, teddy bear campsite with ammo, ballistic fiber, some screws, and it's a regular spawn for a scorched officer, not that we need the codes. Been there for well over month. 
---
I head down to the freak show regularly for the drumsticks, ranger outfit, free meat, and easy xp.
---
Huh that’s good to know for when I get around to making another character. Would like the plans for my main but I feel like I’m way too high a level to see them at this point. Thanks for the info 
---
Gotcha, I respect your idea of gameplay but disagree. Thanks for a fun read
---
Rank 2 Starched Genes lets you keep mutations from any type of healing radiation.
---
Make sure not to unequip it right away after healing radiation especially on laggier server give it at least 5 seconds to stay safe.
---
They found a part in an older game that mentions a brotherhood fleet traveled by there in the early days. Fo76 keeps up by saying those travellers influenced locals to open their own brotherhood factions.
---
There IS I admit an inconsistency with the logo. The Big gear is meant to be on the side of the represented unit. For example western brotherhood has a large gear on the left of the sword.
---
This.. could have been prevented, or easily fixed later.
---
Trying:
---
try-ing 
---
Definition: caps exploits, duping exploits, XP exploits, false advertising to your consumers, server crashes, releasing private personal information to the public, absurdly over priced atom shop, copy and pasted textures from Fallout 4, unrewarding end game, etc.
---
Yeah man they’re definitely trying lmao you’re better off sticking to the lame argument the rest of the fanboys use of “well I still enjoy this game.” Because that’s all you have. This is a AAA $60 game? No. This is an absolute sham.
---
Several youtubers do videos with screw farming locations, as well as lead, springs, etc.
---
Yeah, except he actually makes compelling arguments in his review about the game, you can’t say something is good when it’s not, and he knows this, it’s just that most people on this sub think only the things Bethesda did outside of the game was bad.
---
The Satire Attire Set will include 3 different sets of clothing so you can bullshit any time of the day at a cool 5000 Atoms. It’ll be discounted to 4950 Atoms on April 1st I’d hold out till then. 
---
That is Bethesda buggy, they've counted on modders to fix their games for far too long and they can't with a multiplayer title like 76. 
---
Also the continued support is always nice but I wish people would stop acting like that isn't the norm for an open world multiplayer survival game like 76 because it absolutely is, even the ones made by tiny indie studios.
---
Inventory as well, as it is very annoying having to use perk cards based on carry weight. I hate that I have to equip that sht sometimes.
---
is this vendor the only place you can get it? can you also point me to him? i m still just lvl 15 so not tha knowledgeable
---
Oh yeah, I’ve
---
Sold steel scrap, gunpowder, just about anything
---
 Never has issues with the perk but I’m not exactly surprised that it they’re are issues with it.
---
I said BETH doesnt know shit about MMO
---
zeni obviously does. Do you have no reading comprehension?
---
just because a publisher is involved doesnt mean they control big aspects of the game. And yes, the obviously control parts, because its Beth legacy since its a TES game, but gameplay wise ESO was Zenis area.
---
Anyhow, you cant read, I dont give a shit
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
It is a red herring as you've dismissed alternatives suggested to you in preference of claiming you are under aggressive attack.
---
Once you've placed your camp circle, you can use edit mode to pick up the module and set it wherever you'd like.
---
That happens about 10 percent of the time to me. The game randomly decides to remove parts of my power armor. Weird. 
---
I don't get how you guys are "shocked" about people seeking for money. It's like the oldest shit in society we do. Stop feeding vloggers, streamers and reviewers if you're shocked: they'll always jump on the current bandwagon for views and donations. A youtuber talking about a game IS NOT AN ORACLE, he/she's only someone looking for MONEY. 
---
This game is an absolute sham. 
---
XP exploits, caps exploits, duping exploits, the canvas bag / nuka dark false advertising,  releasing personal info to the public, everything about this just screams trying? Cmon. This post is for upvotes at the very best.
---
Do you get it back?
---
I got a 3* TSE Pump I’m trying to sell. Lol
---
Many thanksl
---
This is the lamest excuse ever. Other games are stupid, so this one should be too. Building an armory after an apocalypse is a completely logical thing to do. Shuffling a bunch of things around a closet and throwing useful things in the garbage has nothing to do with surviving. 
---
This happened to me in the Bog.  It took control of the scorched things, and even a scorchbeast. 
---
Another scorchbeast showed up and attacked - and the Flatwoods monster one-shot it.
---
I guess we know who is actually the top of the food chain in Appalachia.
---
Did anyone else's widescreen support break with this update? :( 
---
Finishing the brotherhood storyline on the main story was harder for me - finding Taggerdty because of all the SB activity then more SBs in the Glassed Caverns.  Also discovered the hard way you had to do it all at once, I stopped one time after discovering the Glassed Caverns portion and had to redo all that triangulation work.
---
Just because you like something doesn’t mean that the people who don’t like it are wrong, it just means that you have different opinions. Fallout 76 is a bad game, if you don’t know this already you’re lying to yourself. You can like a bad game, there’s nothing wrong with that.
---
I'm in the ban all cheaters camp... duplicators and weight glitchers alike. It all hurts the in game economy.
---
No bruh pretty sure they were raided 
---
There is cooldown when you get mutation, you need to server swap if you want to get another mutation faster.
---
Fighting The Scorchbeast Queen is usually very laggy so it makes sense for the loot to take a minute to load which has been my experience.
---
That's regional TO the man---
---
Shit, that doesn't work. Never mind.
---
Yes. It was just not equipped. It’s never dropped armor. 
---
Amazing build! Do you remember where you got the stoplight from?
---
&gt; I get your general point but I think it is a balance and your comment just dismisses everyone with real criticism.
---
No, I'm just dismissing people who do nothing but complain even when good things happen. 
---
And I have max rank of that perk that makes your limbs harder to cripple. I haven’t used a stimpak since like lvl 30 now that I have healing factor
---
&gt; Can you suggest some kinda fix other than my current fast travel away and avoid solution ? 
---
Well .. that does not tell me anything. I've also not heard of any issue with the Charleston station since beta. You know what else is neat?
---
Telling me your PC is better than your brothers PC does not tell me a single thing. Nor does it give me a way to advise you. It seems advice is not what you're after though. In which case I have nothing more to offer.
---
I first purchased the game on the Xbox as I was going to play co-op with a mate, but quickly worked out that this was the Fallout I have always wanted, its feel more "survival end of the World" to me. 
---
I havnt been back to the X Box since (but if they give me mouse and keyboard support on the X this could change... hint hint) - I log in and play most days.
---
I understand that some people arnt happy, but as multiplayer games go, its got me hooked :)
---
The scroll bar is annoying.
---
Literally just murdered someone for slapping me while using a vendor in the last 5 mins at Charleston station - level 12 who had what I expect is a large amount of duped junk (on console) in his paper baggy - normally wouldn’t get as annoyed at a lil slap if it was a mistake but anyone who hits me cos they can’t wait their turn is getting an double 5.56 explosive in their face - would be good to see more than one use a vendor at any time.

You jump and spam crouch button in air you should crouch and stand a few times in air then it’ll happen and I didn’t get it to work without a power armor chassi
---
Are you doing it over and over to the point of causing server instability?
---
It’s my excavator armor. So I’m hoping it’s back in my inventory when I log back in 👍🏼
---
Man, I didn't even clue in that the loot spawn and workbench issues were a symptom of that too.. had soooo many issues with that last night and it was driving me crazy!
---
If you are in PS4 I can craft it for you if you give me the mats. I don't know where I picked up the plan, but i didn't buy it. So it was from an event or spawn. I used to farm the raider camp at top of the world regularly, so that could have been it, but I'm not sure.
---
pretty sure this is actually grafton steel, but i agree with the rest of your comment.
---
I didn't know that you could downvote something past 0 before looking at this post. Lol.
---
Fuck them. I don't care who it pisses off.   If you own duped items, then you are a beneficiary of  cheating and practices that are breaking the game for everyone else.  Moreover, for every person they piss off by deleting duped items, there are at least a dozen people who will be thrilled because they no longer have to watch some asshole at Uranium fever one- shot killing everything and  causing everyone else to miss out on loot and legendary weapons. 
---
Lead the adds to lowbie leechers and watch them die? 
---
Oxhorn's fan base would like a word with you.
---
I usually just kill the lowbies and it resets the queen HP
---
If I remember correctly it was around that high in F4, essentially you traded off having a huge DPS weapon for a hard hitting suppressing weapon since you could keep firing for a while. My main uses Tenderizer and Suppressor so of course I was gonna give him a Gatling Laser for that very reason.
---
I have a keyboard plugged into my Xbox for Rocket League chat and it's helped a lot in this game to send a quick Xbox message. But an in game text chat would be amazing. 
---
So this is a bug more than it is a personal issue and I'm not sure if bethesda is aware or not but here it goes.
---
Srgt PEANUT
---
Issue is that legendary armor pieces that reduce weapon weight will sometimes not work properly when logging into a server. I have to remove the chest piece, log out, log back in, equip the chest piece again. It works similarly to how the pocketed armor bug was acting before it got fixed.
---
My advice for junk managment is to make sure you scrap all of your junk before you stash it, bulk your junk frequently, and give yourself a hard limit on how much of each scrap you keep. Be sure to check your scrap inventory at least every few times you drop more stuff in. 
---
Some things you'll never need to have a large amount of at once. My rule of thumb is that I probably wont need more than 8 bulk of anything (even if you're stocking up to have extra) except maybe aluminum, springs, and lead. Your crafting and repair needs may vary however, so take note of what materials you most frequently use. Sell all but maybe 2 or 3 bulk of the materials you don't really need and tag the components you're low on/are constantly using so that you're not picking up unnecessary junk while scavenging.
---
Side note, which underarmours count as "casual?"
---
None of the ones I tried did.
---
Another 200 would be nice, but the joy would only last a few days, I'm afraid.

That said, yes, I want ;)

No problem, thanks for providing the info! Very fascinating stuff.

Are any of us programmers or game designers? I’m sure as hell not. 
---
I mean, if it’s as easy as you guys make it sound, (and seeing how it’s among the top complaints from gamers) why haven’t they just clicked ‘run program’?

There’s got to be something that makes it difficult.

---
I found one pair of calibrated shocks, also been farming for second one for some weeks now. Done several hours just server hoping, lol.
---
&gt; I personally think they should have started BETA way sooner 
---
I'm not trying to bash Bethesda, more the game industry in general. Particularly the "triple A" studios. 
---
I miss the days when Beta meant exactly that. When a beta was done WAY before launch so the studio had time to make meaningful changes. Now? Beta is just a flowery way of saying "We'll let you play the game for a few days before everybody else can".
---
Really so if i had no idea i juat bought a duped item off of the fallout 76 bazzar or traded it from a friend i should have my weapon deleted after paying 5k caps for it? Even though i never violated TOS? You seem to have no grasp on how the world works. The last thing bethesda needs is a PR nightmare on that scale 
---
I don’t know how but I got posses 10000 caps randomly from just normally logging in, didn’t have 10000 caps
---
I have probably 100 screws spare on XB1
---
In 100+ hours I have literally never had Patrol Duty show up, even server hopping at the prison hasn't helped.

 The needed to plug the hole first.

Server hop at Freddys House of Scares, guaranteed Wendigo and Wendigos drop 5-6 screws

Locking high-end crafting plans behind the gate of endgame content seems like a bad idea.

Calling me “son” ? Ha ha who is the millennial

I was playing ESO right up until Fallout 76 came out. I will likely go back and forth depending in which game just released new content

Well fuck lol why I want someone to sell it to me

lol, that is mean :D hahaha

Thank you, I meant translate, verb
---
I knew that clipboards had springs, forgot that they also had screws.  I had stopped collecting them and that's when I started running out of springs.  
---
Ok let’s talk about the game and not the surrounded false advertising issues and Bethesda releasing personal private info of people to the public.
---
XP exploits, caps exploits, duping exploits, broken quests, server crashes, unrewarding endgame, questionable game mechanics like the scorchbeast overall, copy and pasted textures from fallout 4, the atomic shop and its prices- do you see where I’m going here? Please explain to me how you are shocked. Because I can keep going. 
---
Could have been worse. This could have been a Activision joint venture
---
Banning all Youtubers is pretty extreme.  Despite lower than average views on my channel, I still do a Fallout 76 series because I love the game.

---
is there a way to respec/realocate points and perks?
---
The best way to do it is to have safe zones and unsafe zones. Workshops are obviously unsafe zones. PvP should be completely open with that perimeter. Also if someone hits or kills another player they should be flagged for PvP to everyone. Doesn't matter if they killed a bounty. And people shouldn't disappear from the map during PvP encounters, unless they are crouching. It should be some automatic feature to disappear if you engage in PvP.
---
Bumping to see if anyone has found out yet.
---
Are you high or just thinking of a different game? ESO has done nothing but grow significantly since the revamp of the game from the top down when they released it on Consoles
---
Same here. But i must say im lvl 36 now and till today i have yet to be attacked by another player.
---
The only thing happening was others greeting and doing love emotes.
---
Im thankful for that and hope it stays that way. 
---
Skeptical of this.  OP's other posts are about hunting down dupers, and warning about duped items, other things that seem intent of scaring people off duping.  But then has a duper friend that sends them pictures of personal emails.  Bethesda targets some unknown person, banning them at night when the there office is closed.  Doesn't seem to care about the 4-5 youtubers that do this, and profit off it, with there gamertags clearly on the screens.  Not much of the story adds up.
---
The refund is for falsely advertising the merchandise.
---
&gt; Yes it is buggy
---
It's not the bugs that irk me, though they are often frustrating beyond belief.  It's the things that were poorly or just thoughtlessly not implemented - particularly the inventory UI overall.  Mods like BetterInventory and PerkLoadout should and are an embarrassment to bsg's carelessness.
---
Nevermind no GM tools, no attempt to convert the console interface for PC mouse users, can't tell if plans are known etc.  Basic things things that don't need any "mmo experience" to know they are essential, yet here we are praising them for maybe addressing in the future.
---
You read what you wrote prior to this, right?
---
If you need me to, I can re-write that you can fight without a hazmat suit and without PA in a nuke zone.
---
The decision is yours on whether you find Rad Sponge more believable or an infinitely working hazmat suit. Scoffing at what works because you want to believe a hazmat should should never be damaged beyond being useable is an opinion I won't share......
---
We Tom Clancy's The Division now
---
A player shouldn’t be able to carry 3000 lbs legitimately. That’s too much and should have a *heavy* penalty associated with it if allowed.
---
I’m glad to see the sub moving in this direction of positivity and appreciation. So often people jump all over the developers, when they’re giving it their best effort given their available resources. I personally love the game and have had a blast despite the bugs. 
---
If you play Fallout, and expect there not to be any bugs, you’re gonna have a bad time.
---
It is dropped, as far as I can tell, randomly from savage divide events (like uranium fever).
---
The game is a scam and false advertising, well within reason for a refund.
---
I used to program, but you don't have to be one to understand that computers can look shit up for you. 
---
If your on ps4 I have about 5 in my 8nventory from farming legendaries tonight, I'm about to drop them all
---
When you've done all that there is to be done, then try teaming up, its almost like you get a whole new game.  I mostly do teaming now because I found an awesome group of genuinely good people, but I do love ignoring invites and setting off on my own now and then.
---
Bad luck man. I don’t like when the lowers levels show up either makes the fight twice as long. This is also why I don’t feel that TSE should be adjusted. It’s hard enough beating her having high end weapons and almost impossible with lower level player contributing nothing to the fight. And easy solution is to level gate so it only acknowledges and rewards players after level 50.
---
I don't know about 100, considering I can easily do that just by looting some mole miners or super mutants.  Double your max capacity would be a good limit in my opinion.
---
Good
---
Bethesda said no, so we will see what mastercard says.

He was hit by a board, silly, not a bullet.

They've put out several notices and follow-ups.
---
it's really cool, i tried to convey what i feel about it as a gamer whose formative moments in gaming were spent in myst and fallout 1 and a few of the more violent games as next gen began to proliferate and a few of the least violent ones since then. i want them to understand what is so one of a kind with this, what makes it special to me, when they try to understand what i suggest for making it shine even brighter.
---
K bruh
---
I’m honestly addicted to the game it’s the main game I play rn
---
100% yes
---
There’s more to it than size. Hello Games had nothing in the pipeline. Bethesda has two more very high profile games coming, and now there’s even more pressure for them to be amazing. Plus, larger companies have to work with corporate, and economically the time and money spent on fixing a game like 76 just to get back a little trust makes a lot less sense than making a new game everyone has to buy again.
---
Nah, the stash limit is fine. We just need the craft bag from ESO which has unlimited space for crafting materials. All categorized. 
---
stupid question 
---
.
---
how do u do the daily quests?  
---
for me when i go to data&gt;daily&gt;  its greyed out, and I don't know how/where to start it !
---
What I mean is it doesn't have Elder Scrolls gameplay and mechanics. And that's not a bad thing. I play it and think the combat is a lot of fun!
---
They really turned that game around at the end.
---
Depending on if you use power armor or normal armor alot.
---
Screw and springs are essential for fixing most power armor, ballistic fiber for normal armor. Also if you want to build the excavator power armor, you need alot of black titanium.
---
If you use alot of ammo, lead and gunpowder is useful for crafting them.
---
&gt;The bugs have taken their toll and removed any enjoyment I had. When a company allows this kind of business practice, I refuse to be a part of it.
---
So if you're never buying a game with bugs I got bad news for you...
---
I even think that the most correct genre definition for FO76 is immersive sim.
---
I like it too
---
I can't say they're connected with complete certainty, but 90% of the time if you can't loot a body or enter crafting you've got about 10min before the server crashes 
---
The good ol' FabOut Forte quote, I remember it clearly
---
 Military fatigues, flannel shirt and jeans, undershirt and jeans, VTU tracksuit, grafton tracksuit.
---
This, although I got bored a few weeks ago.  They need to fix bugs and work on balance then add content and repeat.
---
Hell, a village of game-developing kitties would do better than Bethesda. (I doubt many people will get this) 
---
Radscorpion, I choose you!
---
That's the Postman outfit, comes with a Canvas bag, no tricentennial edition required. 
---
If they tried they would have released the game in 2019 fully ready for launch with all perks and weapons playable. Instead, for more than a month my explosive weapons on my explosive build HEALED my enemies. Argue if you want, Bethesda is a incompetent corporation and this was the last game I ever buy from them. Fuck them for ruining my play so they could get the game out early.
---
There is, I sacrifice mobility, and perks, the weight when perks are accounted for is only around 1300, it's a very different and interesting way to play, and I am really enjoying it.
---
If you want to ruin my fun the kindly sod off.
---
You're talkin logic buddy and that shit don't work on YouTube only bad news sells.
---
I have the same problems. I have a dozen “undiscovered” locations even though I’ve visited them all on numerous occasions. 
---
Just noticed something else is that picture that’s bugging the shit of of me. Look at the massive typo, discover locale, discover locale, discover location. Bethesda can’t even spot a massive inconsistency with the text. They have no quality standards. 
---
^this
---
Ban the lot of these fuckers. I doubt it happens but I hope it does. I think they will target the big ones as it seems there probably isn't any way to track it right now. If there were a way to do it then surely they would mass ban them and send a message. This isn't the case and is only YouTubers so I am going to guess that's all the further we are getting right now. One can only hope.
---
I kinda hope the guy who one time randomly asked me if i knew how to dupe actually found out before all this.
---
I managed to stack them, but I had the Vault Nuka-Tapper in my stash when I found the Magazine.
---
Where'd you buy it from and when? If you want a refund, I suggest taking a look at their refund policy and how long you got to make that decision. If you're past the window, you're past the window.
---
300% regen only works when not in combat so it is useless when fighting
---
Stop standing in the void zones man
---
I don't have a single exploding weapon and you get one from a just fixed loot table hours after patch.
---
Bugs are normal, this many bugs and from a previous game are not. They are unacceptable.
---
Its probably a bug or glitch. I now switched from T60 Power armor to X-01 and I dont have this issue anymore. I dont have to chug radaway every minute and try to fight enemies. I dont know why but I always got full rad damage even with +1000 rad resistant suit or power armor. As soon as I switched to the new PA, my rad damage resistant went back to normal. 
---
Same experience last night. Crashed to desktop while fighting the queen. Before the patch, it only happened 3-4 in the last 2-3 months.
---
I'd also love to hop in line for this! I've got to farm a bit but, I'll let you know when I get the stuff and I'll happily throw in some caps if you're willing to craft this for me. Thank you!
---
It's in the most disappointing games of 2018 and I think that's a very fair spot to put it.

Thats how mafia works

I agree with you all. It just upsets me that game companies are ok with taking this route. Ie; Sea of Thieves, Ark etc...

Ran into this when transferring items to containers to give to a team mate a couple times, not always happening, just in container transferring it seems or perhaps when the total is above a certain amount it caused the scrolled to jump back to the top instead of stop at 1.

Bird bones is good if you have class freak.

You didn't?

*Capslock intensifies*

It would be a great idea, if you actually lost items of value on death.

No. It's fine as it is.
---
You really don't understand the ramifications of this duping do you? There will never be a fair or immersive PvP or economic part of this game because of the duping... I don't think banning is enough. They need to also remove duped weapons from anyone who has them or  at the bare minimum adjust weapon level so that best in slot is not just all Lvl 50 and it will make the old duped guns worthless.
---
People who duped violated the ToS, and in case you don't read those at all, most of the time they include language along the lines of being able to ban you at any time for any reason. I think a ban is perfectly fair despite this being something that is in the game. It has effected all other players between killing the PvP that  already sucked and making an economy impossible. Anyone who is buying or trading guns atm is stupid in my eyes, because if Bethesda ever wants an economy they have no choice but to somehow make duped guns worthless.
---
Pfft, I won't believe you until you hand it to me and let me use it for like...ever.
---
Thanks Brother! =)
---
Maybe if they didn't make the worst game ever that wouldn't have happened.
---
It happens. I've never seen a million dollars cold hard cash but I imagine it exists.
---
People like you ruin *my* fun by causing server issues, so you can sod off.
---
Radscorpions are kind of tough in general, especially if you're trying to melee them at level 21. I'm not sure if there is an optimal build for that - You're using power armor, right? That adds a couple Strength points, as well as some defense, even the frame or the basic raider power armor, I think. 
---
Also, not sure what portion of the map you're at, but I didn't see many radscorpions in 76 vs. the other Fallout games. I know there are a couple near the Top of the World - Remember that they can't climb well. So, shoot them a couple of times, then run out from the elevator area and to the area outside, which has some trucks and rocks you can climb on top of. From there, you should be able to pick them off safely using VATS. 
---
Everyone praises the Patchnotes, meanwhile i only see how Buggy the Game REALLY is based on the Patchnotes.
---
How many Bugs and Glitches are there? Every System ingame is Bugged somehow.
---
There is a big chance that during Bug fixing with Patches, some other Bugs come Back, because Code..
---
Guys, dont understand me wrong, i play the Game every Day. But it will take a long time and effort to fix such a Bug-ridden piece of Software.
---
No ?
---
So this could be true. But I've never seen Bethesda send a ban message stating the "EXACT" reason why they were banned. Usually it will say that they violated the terms and conditions. But are never specific.
---
**but didnt produce ESO, zeni max did.
---
Basically its a zeni max game just published by bethesda.
---
So no, they dont know shit about MMO**
---
There's your comment and you never actually said "Beth" anywhere. 
---
My reading comprehension is fine. Perhaps if you reached something other than 5th grade English you would understand how to construct a more well thought out and proper sentence conveying what you actually mean. 
---
Oh but then if people could understand your piss poor thoughts you wouldn't be able to back peddle when called out lol.
---
Damn raiders 
---
If the patch notes are any indication they are busy and sounds like are listening to our feedback. Might be a long road, but it's a good sign.
---
I feel your pain. Took me two weeks to get ONE excavator calibrated shock, hopping Harper's Ferry for roughly two hours every day.
---
Then a buddy visits Harper's Ferry for the first time ever by fast traveling to me, and of course it's there.
---
He buys it for me, and was eternally grateful.
---
Then I vendored it by accident like 20 min later.....
---
Now I have one spare, it's so random.
---
What do these sell for ingame anyway?

 The princess is in another castle?

Surely there is. As i said. The moment that other guy without PA did oneshot my generator, i instantly gutted him with my Meathook. Didn't take even a second. But there is nothing you can do against it, since the other one did not attack me at first or shot anything, so i couldn't kill him, but he can kill me since i killed his friend. And that was the shitty moment i only have a gripe about.
---
My bigger issue with it is simply the cockiness these idiots have then. I mean seriously.. bragging about killing someone below your level and below your equipment? That is kind of the lowest form of PvP you can get at. Surely that is w hat they wanted. But it doesn't mean i can't "vent" about it. Do not even wish those idiots the plague or anything. Most i wish them is that they run into a bug and lose their TSE weapons through it. Because i am absolutely sure they instantly quit the game and piss on Bethesda, saying what bad of a game Fallout 76 is. xD
---
You guys keep complaining about the game, or praising the game, and I'm over here in the corner, just praying to God that I can get some screws to end my eternal suffering in leveling purgatory.
---
One of the things I wonder about 76 is just how much they can alter the game's physical world in updates.
---
An area which is a separate load, like a Vault, is possible.  Adjusting the boundaries of the world to add new areas off to the side too.  But adding new buildings or removing spaces?  Not sure.
---
First, determine whether you will be a power armor user or no PA.  you can get your first set at 25 (you'll need to gather the materials).  If non PA, there are a lot of damage resistant bonus perk cards. I believe blocker works for both builds.  Lone wanderer is also nice if youre set on solo, but I would advocate for joining a team and using body guards. You can team with other players and stay solo, you just get a lot more fast travel options.  I wouldn't restart your first character until after you get to 50 or unless you have a clear picture on what you want your build and SPECIAL distribution will be (use character builder tools like Nukes and Dragons).
---
&gt; That would be a borderline impossibility seeing as how you’d have to look up each and every player then go into their inventory.
---
If only there were some technology available that could be used to ask questions about things like this.  A... I dunno, base layer of data to which such queries could be directed.  Curse our inadequate modern technology!
---
No seriously dude, that's probably 3 lines of SQL run against an offline backup.  We're talking hundreds of thousands of players tops, with even the worst offenders having inventories in the thousands of stacks.  A billion record result is the kind of thing you can fit on a USB stick and get from the underlying storage in half an hour.
---
Because of my age at the time I didn't play the older games. I know I'm not proud. (Its on the todo list). Fallout NV was my first play which came out when I was about 14 or 15. I then played 3 and started making mods for both until fallout 4 came about.
---
I had played a lot of games when I was younger and had loved fallout for the fact you can choose how you approach... just about anything.
---
And I think Bethesda has been a very good listener indeed
---
Yea I played New Vegas just a week ago, and I found T45D, then I was wondering how to get it in 76, but you cant
---
And you, YOU are aloud to enjoy that. A lot of people on this subreddit don’t seem to get that.
---
Me too, how else do I get screws? Farm them like some kind of Democrat?
---
Killing a veritable plethora in a bunker less than 24 hours ago.
---
how is Gauss rifle? its my series favourite but i m still just lvl 15 
---
Purchased directly through Bethesda. They only reason they denied refund is because it's a digital download. That in itself is a BS reason.
---
Things have gotten really weird ever since they hired that Scorchbeast dev. 
---
The lightning auto aims somewhat? You sure? I didn’t have any perks to increase damage of rifles or energy weapons but the damage seemed really pitiful, does it really do more damage if you shoot towards the ground rather then at the enemy? I know it would have done more if I had perks in rifle or whatever but it still seemed to do a lot less then it should? 
---
Hmmm. I'll just throw all the games in my stash then once I get em so I can collect more! Thanks for your input! 
---
Be gone twat 
---
It's about consumer standards and what people are willing to put up with. I wonder if you would buy a car 2 months before it is produced, to then wait months as your new car is being fixed, patched and debugged while you try to enjoy it regularly.
---
If you would then you are different type of consumer than us who complained and turned the undercooked meal back.
---
You mean graham and rose? 
---
Something tells me that there are two separate mentalities when it comes to NPCs. 
---
On one side you have folks who understand NPC means non playable character. Vendors, whitesprings robots, super mutants, these are all NPCs. 
---
On the other side you have NPCs from previous games (Bethesda and other companies) that are more,,, engaging? They’ll give you some story info or past history or a mission. 
---
That’s my two caps lol. 
---
They are popular because these "champions" are critical only of the companies. And follow the rule that "The customer/gamer is always right". Which is totally wrong. A gamer or even the gaming community can easily be wrong. But many people online don't want to hear this. Instead they follow the youtubers with the "companies can do no good, gamers can do no wrong" narrative, because they feel empowered by it.
---
That's why many people online don't like Jason Schreier. That guy is as honest and as neutral as it gets. But he doesn't lick the ass of the general gaming community and quite often calls them out when they become demaning, abusive or entitled. And of course many gamers don't like being called out. 
---
We need a new Total Biscuit. A youtuber who was fair to both sides. Despite calling out the companies a lot, he wasn't afraid to lambast the community when it was necessary. Many people attempt to become new TB, yet noone achieved that because they don't understand that being negative towards the companies wasn't the spirit of TB's content.
---
Well the main thing with their dupe was making an assload of boards so they could look at that or the 9 million carry weight.
---
Keep only 50 of everything, unless its important to you
---
I think a suspension should be the first call and then permanent bans. 
---
I lost over 400 .44 rounds to feed the people.
---
You should have taken a video and left after the first time he killed you when you were not intending to engage.
---
You got me there
---
Very dumb. I was plan farming at workshops and one guy came and tried to take one that I just took, I died, lost 75 caps, came back and killed him with help from a friend, gained 10 caps back. 
---
Only other thing I can think of is that starched genes isn't fully upgraded...or just lag maybe?
---
Switch servers after every mutation, as it is on a cooldown period after you get one, unless you gotta another server.
---
Curious, but how many hours did you log in game?
---
I'd argue they're trying to improve the defective product by patching the exploits and banning people who have used them to wreck the game economy.  
---
Caps appropriate here
---
Fallout 76 has enormous potential. If you cannot see the opportunities rising up with an online fallout you clearly are ignorant.
---
Here are a few of my ideas:
---
-being able to build camp villages
---
-Player vendors with verification
---
-more NPCs
---
-a better system for perks past lvl 50
---
-ability to actually rebuild POIs
---
-a lot more Camp items
---
-bigger stash
---
-more camp space
---
-player made quests.
---
-actual 5 star weapons
---
-better enemy scaling(maybe like in Dead Island)
---
-companions (dogs, robots whatever)
---
-player made companies for different services( ammo, hunting, crafting)
---
Id love to see a thriving economy whith companies offering services and products just like in real life.
---
I have many more ideas but that all that comes to my mind rn. 
---
Yep, started my 2nd just before Xmas. Not making a CAMP, not fast travelling, not doing any main or side quests, only Dailies and Event. Completely different experience, really enjoying just looting exploring and stuff. Also, wanted to get the handmade plans, and did, at level 15 at Harper’s Ferry. 
---
Will start doing the quests at level 50.
---
&gt; I can't wait to see how this game will look a year from now...
---
I can.  And will.  
---
It's fun.... But it's not a good game.   Yet.
---
Its not fluid but i think its enough to let users continue a role play. Thanks for details and locations of info too
---
well if I was them what I'd do is tie the stash size into the main starter quest 
---
start 200 stash tier 1 - upgraded stash tier 2 400 pounds (responders area) tier 3 600 / tier 4 800 / tier 5 1000
---
this would allow for a progressively bigger stash that would grow with you and stop mule accounts from just being mass produced easily as well as making the game grow slowly as you see it
---
that lets you build two legs for the excavator PA at level 45
---
No I quit playing after reaching lvl 50 weeks ago.
---
Also, I'm pretty sure they only took my workshop because I refused to fight them, but if you start to claim it you have to choice but to fight.
---
NPCs are non-player characters. For example, Rose is a character, is not a player, thus an NPC. That's all there is to it.
---
I’m not sure anyone is underselling the broken product part. 
---
There has literally been a thousand posts directed towards this. It’s the reason Bethesda has even responded to us in the first place. The uproar in general. For duping, It seems like they tried a simple fix in the mean time (last patch) to actually be able to fix it with this patch. Hopefully.
---
This doesn’t change anything about you agreeing to a TOS. Duping is EXPLOITING. If you are duping you are EXPLOITING. 
---
How does it not have real quests? As for NPCs the holotapes and notes make this world feel more believable than canned NPCs could.
---
Yeah Its a bug, I had the same issue with my T60 Power armor. I was receiving mad rad damage in nuke zones and consuming rad away every minute to keep up. I wrote a Reddit thread about this and people were making fun of me. I tried the +1000 Hazmat suite without any success. At that point, I thought the game was built that way and accepted it as it is. As soon as I get the X01 PA it went back to normal. I can just chill in nuke zones without bothered by Radiation damage. 
---
It's a glitch that affects some users. 
---
So if I'm having fun, you think it's within your right to make sure I have less fun, to hurt Bethesda? That doesn't make *them* look bad, it just makes *you* look like an ass.
---
Who made you the be-all end-all decider of fun?
---
You want more of you ?
---
This is annoying lost count the amount of time this happened to me. End up paying caps to fast traveling then get booted. 
---
You’re talking to someone who’s played for many many hours. I know how to distinguish between people playing and people dipping. Trust me, I’m very good I what I do. I even utilize chat. 
---
I was so convinced when everyone said that you couldn't play it alone, that I waited for my friends before even touching it. However, with different time zones and responsibilities, it made it hard for us to all find time. Don't get me wrong, it was a blast playing with them and seeing new stuff together, but I didn't buy a $60+ game just to play it twice a month. So starting this new year, I decided just to see what it was like playing alone.
---
Oh my God! Do I not have any regrets. It has been absolutely amazing and just a pure blast.
---
And after i had a harsh disagreement with someone in Discord again, since he said that Fallout 76 is a colossal failure and i tried to defend the game, i say the same here.
---
Thank you Bethesda. Thanks that you still try to do your best to fix the game for the percentage of players who enjoy the game and don't jump onto this idiotic hatetrain going on against you and the game.
---
I know very well how harsh it can be to stick to your believes at times when everyone spits on you. So everyone form Bethesda and who worked and still works on the game. Thank you.
---
Oof
---
It doesn’t work that way unless you seek revenge.
---
I have never been killed without having a bounty, attacking the other person backer seeking revenge after dying. They do so little damage when “slapping” that it’s virtually impossible. Some claim they can kill with crazy weapons like a TSE dragon but I’ve yet to see this.
---
You have to go sell the stuff you bulk. It's pretty great, you generally get 1 cap per unit bulked.
---
It's a specific camp, for some reason it takes forever for the map to update with the correct marker.
---
I wanna say it was nearish Flatwoods - at the lookout tower.
---
Trying as in banning people who post glitch videos? They are like fucking Hitler
---
It’s not that the sub can’t take critical opinions, your comment just contained too little critical content. 
---
Desk fans and aluminum, yes. Keep like 20 bulk aluminum max. Screw hard limit is up to you. Keep as much of rare materials to fix weapons and armors and keep between 50-100 of everything else, amount varying based on how important they are to said repairs. 
---
The first step is admitting there's a problem. You did that. We're all counting on you, Vault Dweller. 
---
Don't you?
---
How many times did you run back to him?
---
I doubt he was one shotting you outside pvp, did you shoot at him?  Do you have pacifist on?
---
I don't really see the problem here. If they're dumb enough to not only record themselves cheating (a bannable offense), but then disseminate it on a video platform watched by...everyone, then yeah, I have no sympathy.
---
Corn Soup for life :)
---
 "because I can tell that Bethesda isn’t giving up on it because they would have a long time ago. "
---
You do realise, that they literally just released the game? So what, "long time" ago? past month?
---
Ofc not
---
Atm you can make you character completely immune to explosive damage. Explosive weapon arent the only one shot mechanic in the game like a VATs crit to head will almost always gib people
---
Look me up when you're on next. GT is the same as my name here.
---
Ok? 
---
Happened to me though :/ and yes I didn't seek revenge.
---
Wait, you don't want more of me, or you don't want more of you?
---
Yeah and I think this patch fixes it. 
---
Stop hopping. That’s not how the game is intended to be played.
---
if genes isnt maxed you still have chance of losing the mutation
---
Fallout 4 actually had a decent framerate for the most part on PS4 compared to 76 and of course review are biased it their opinion! Different people like different things and they should be able to state their opinion. I do agree that people like Cleanprincegaming and other youtubers are overreacting to it. But Angry Joe isn't one of those YouTubers. 
---
BETHESDA BETHESDA ÜBER ALLES
---
Were you wearing power armor?
---
Clipboards only have wood and spring. 
---
Agreed.
---
Okey thanks. I do like the PA so I can jump down from cliffs
---
But... exploring to find components _is_ playing the game...
---
There are legendary cats, opposum, rabbits, etc...
---
I killed a legendary firefly yesterday and got my first 4 star... a bowie with faster swing speed, increased stagger, ignore armor, and reflect damage while blocking..
---
I toothpicks a Deathclaw to death.
---
Sucks man. It seems like they apply pvp “slap damage” as a percentage of the engaging party’s total damage per shot. If someone has stacked 200 bobbleheads and is hitting for 50,000 per shot, that same percentage is a one shot kill even with slap damage. PvP kills shouldn’t earn caps unless the other party has engaged in return, period.
---
Good luck in finding team mates for your game :) I was hoping you was on PC but you're on XB ..... got to admit I'd like to have a few team mates on my game but hey I'm leveled up on Lone Wanderer now so maybe next game :)
---
Oh I forgot I also have Thru Hiker 3 too. It isn't carrying the weight around in general it's just after looting everything. EVERYTHING. Guns, ammo, anything not nailed down that let's me pick it up. I'm like a vacuum for items mainly due to fear of server crashes and not getting the chance to go back for it. When I finish a run I dump what I don't want, scrap what I can and either vendor or store the rest in stash.
---
To answer directly though I have a lot of food, drink, meds and my main ammo types. Until they fix the weight issue on RadAway and reduce a few rifle weights I will likely always be close to my limits even with perks. I probably have about 7 or 8 different weapons and at least one type of grenade on me. I also have two sets of normal armour plus my power armour. I like options but not being able to stash it or sell other stuff means I end up at around 300 weight, more in power armour as my armour has weight reduction stats.
---
As it did for me, don't lose hope. I had someone tell me what I'm telling you, so I pass the torch to you now.
---
I absolutely love playing solo. My charisma has been at 1 since the beginning since I've never really played with anyone. Occasionally one of my friends join me and we'll play for a few hours, but I'm mostly by myself which is fine. It's also fun seeing other players wander around and giving them a thumbs up to indicate that you're friendly and they do it back. As glitchy and rough this game is, I'm having an awesome time with it!
---
Just hope the don't pee in it
---
I agree that the world design is really good. The quest design is boring and lazy. The game has decent bones if they could add better content and produce a really stable platform. There are a  a lot of cool places and interesting mini stories within the game but it’s all really disconnected. 
---
I just throw away, give away or sell all the shit I don’t use, which is almost everything I pick up.
---
Right now my stash is at like 505, which is the highest it’s ever been, and there’s a still ton of shit I’ll never use in there. 
---
I’m not sure what you guys are storing, or in some cases, why you’re storing it, but maintaining a lighter weight has been easy as fuck and it’s honestly kinda nice not scrolling through a shitload of Junkies lead pipes and Ghoul Slayers left legs when going through my inventory. 
---
This is a role playing survival game, not pokemon. You can be a server hopping farmer with a “gotta catch ‘em all” mentality, but that’s not what the game is built for, so learn to let go of some junk or enjoy being over encumbered forever, I guess? 
---
Really? Because all I see is people agreeing with this lol
---
None of the above
---
Let's burn the witches! By using witchcraft to set them aflame!
---
where’s the plan for the excavator armour?
---
Ok now you are just moving the goalposts and making shit up to make yourself look less bad. That's not at all what they were arguing. Stop posting.
---
Okay, yeah, that's just arguing against reality at that point.
---
I'm not too far from there, just south of West-Tek in an alcove that offers a very similar view of the Bog and Watoga I'd imagine.  Even built a little deck and chair to watch the bombs drop.  My story is similar - once I found this spot, I was like... I think this is it.
---
It ends up being surprisingly quiet.  Feral wolves and mongrels are the only things that seem to spawn naturally, and I haven't even seen them in a while.  There seems to be a small chance that a Super Mutant or Scorchbeast can wander over based on what nearby players do, but it hasn't been a problem.  The only real problem is a lack of natural water, which wouldn't be such an issue if the Recipe system would accept Purified *or* Boiled Water. 😋
---
I am not doing Rose's quests again.
---
yeah
---
Aww.
---
Why are you telling us again, exactly? 
---
I just farmed the scorched at the airport for 308 and shotgun shells when i was level 10
---
...said no one ever.
---
#3 would be awesome. On #1 you can already see the weapon durability on the wheel.
---
sweet zombie jebus yes.
---
Haha, fair enough. Was just curious.
---
There was apparently something done that people are complaining about: broken hazmat suits reportedly stop giving free rad protection.
---
I was terrible at Nax don't remind me.
---
with the new patch fire proof lvl 3+ the dense mod gives almost a 90% reduction to explosive damage (based on other peoples testing, also takes DR into account so may vary with heaviness of armor). the downside to this is that youd have to run around a nuke zone without power armor. I recommend a team and sharing radsponge/ghoulish.
---
Quit hoarding everything. I guarantee you don't need half of what you have stored.
---
I’m not saying dupe it.... but
---
If u did I wouldn’t snitch
---
At least your insecurities are now reinforced.
---
AtomicMilkMan04. Addd me if you'd like
---
Well if that is the only way you can see it, maybe write the essay about your struggle.  They asked for one about why not to cheat, so not just an explanation. You can still say cheating is bad, without admission of something you claim not to have done.
---
Or just pay $28 and try again.
---
I agree, this is an awesome game that should be coming out of beta about now.
---
Everything wrong can be summed up by saying the upper management at Bethesda made commitments they couldn’t keep, and tried to pass the costs of those bad management decisions on to their customers.
---
That management mistake should result in a negative stock evaluation, and a hit on their reputation.  It will have a demonstrable impact on pre-sales of the next product.  Ultimately upper management should be fired because this is a management and business error, not a dev team problem.
---
All that only happens if money is lost in stock or sales.  Negative feedback loops have to exist for a correction.  If not, then competition will take care of it.
---
id choke sanjay if he wasnt already dead
---
Tananga Town's cave is filled with Cave Crickets:)
---
The downside is that it turned me into such a packrat I never realized just how much space in my stash a bunch of materials was taking!  I may even be able to start phasing out some Strength perks now I've cut down on what I keep...
---
Plant food at camp? And then lose it all when the inevitable disconnect comes?
---
um no lol
---
So it WAS you who stood in the void zone, -100 DKP !
---
the funny thing about this that you can get guass rifles whitch are better than hunting rifles
---
Yeah I do it as I’m playing nuts fun. 
---
Fun is not - finding out you have to do EXTRA scavenging because you sold/dumped excess weight due to the stash limit - this adding extra tedium. 
---
But...I have 15,000 shotgun cartridges I don't use
---
too many, idk.
---
So it was 2.5m monthly active users a year ago, that isn't really a good datapoint to say it is one of the best mmos. You have nothing to compare it to. It isn't a statistic to judge how good a game it is either.
---
Psycho tats exist i can make them
---
Yeah. It’s super shitty that’s been happening. I think it’s because of how flooded the market is with “early access” games still in alpha states passing as open betas. 
---
Yeah but are they TSE ?
---
More like the Jet Pack is for another armor on attempt #388.
---
After the abysmal state at launch the patches have helped a lot. I'd say we're only having to suffer from the Christmas and New Year's break or yesterday's patch would likely have had a little content in it. As it stands there are still a bunch of bugs but they have gotten to a lot of them and I appreciate their work even if it feels like it shouldn't have been so bad initially.
---
&gt;They’ll give you some story info or past history or a mission.
---
There're a bunch of robots in this game that gives you some story info or past history or a mission.
---
I wish I could tell you but I haven’t played the new patch yet but I’ll tell you if it’s fine
---
Nice! 
---
I'm there with ya, but limits need to be set.
---
I agree they messed up on releasing and falsely advertising other products but fallout 76 is one of my favorite games Wright now and I believe It can and will get better.
---
I met a pair of radscorpions at "Middle Mountains Cabins" and then I got totally obliviated by some other insane creatures close to "NAR Repair Yard". Perhaps melee build isn't the best when just slaying creatures
---
So last night i was on a server and my team left, but was still on the server and the owners of all the camps for 15 minutes... i got 4 notifications of attacks at the same time and said screw it and then 2 of them completed with out me doing anything. no other players near them either.. then i got the retake quests and one of them completed with out me doing anything. 
---
What under armour do you have?
---
I can make all 3 BoS Uniform Under Armour variants.
---
I feel like the solo game is the way to play till you finish all the main quests to really explore the world. End game feels like when coop is better or else it feels too much like a grind finding plans, flux and legendaries.
---
Kill eveeyrhing
---
Yes, but they all (activating the scorched detection network, joining the various factions etc.), ladder up and conclude with that one.  The overseers journey is a side quest.
---
Prior to the patch that nerfed low levels getting crazy XP in whitesprings, at 30ish I was getting around 800xp. It might be level dependent now since they are outside &amp; above your level range, maybe since they are lower than me I get that xp. I watch the xp bar pop up every now &amp; then and it shows 400+ for sure. I usually go in well rested but it wouldn't explain the disparity. 
---
I love it.
---
Maybe not the damage to Scorched part. I would be looking for Instigating, 10% increased Damage while aiming, the maybe reduced weight or a point to perception.
---
I've gone down to 100 and 30 of the really common stuff I never use like leather and glass.
---
Rifles are causing most of my problems now.
---
It's not a right, it's the attitude of someone without recourse. Psychological studies in major universities show that 80% of people would willingly have money taken away if someone else had more taken away. welcome to the world.
---
It’s their job to try. Lmao. These posts are such shit. Quit sucking Bethesda’s dick. They are the ones that released this product in such a shit state.
---
I'm level 10 and I have too many weapons with plenty of ammo. So either luck of the draw or you're doing something wrong.
---
Yeah i would add that and cancer perma death.
---
Are you on xbox? I’ll help you out if you hate it that much. I personally like seeing it go off 
---
I think more people than you believe would be effected. Also players who do not break TOS have no reason to be punished. And honestly if youre higher than lvl 50 and havnt traded someone for a TSE handmade at this point its your own fault youre being outmatched especially at this point. You can get them for like 2k caps off the bazaar. And its not like youre gunna loose them because bethesda will never have the man power to cary out these bans
---
They could have waited to release 76 
---
and now they'll just make videos about how bethesda sucks and "Banned them for no reason"
---
lol yeah at the minimum fucking effort.
---
Rusev Day?
---
Ideally you’d predict that in advance, before even releasing your product.
---
DUPING IS GONE
---
it'll be me one day, that's for sure
---
Yeah I'm with you, but you find ways around it. When you run out of an item, tag for search. Then always keep that stuff. Everything else you aggressively bulk and sell.
---
And for me it was about discarding some habits from FO4, like no longer picking up all ammo, and not keeping oddball weapons "just in case." Had to admit that I wasn't specced for heavy weapons, so there's no point in keeping around a broadsider or missile launcher and all that heavy ammo.
---
Wait...west Virginia is a REAL place?! :0
---
For real. Playing solo is great. Tho it is fun to play with a group of friends every now and again.
---
Yeah, they're an odd one in being a strange hybrid in terms of what actually "fires" the projectile. It's for the best that they removed the distinction in perks that effect energy/ ballistic weapons really
---
Events 
---
Did any one of you read anything I said? Did I say there are no NPCs? No. 
---
All I stated was it seems there’s two mentalities to what an NPC is. 
---
I know, and more damage means less durability you use to kill the same creature.
---
Nope.
---
&gt; Or just pay $28 and try again.
---
Not 28. I lost access to Creation Club and everything bought in it for Fallout 4 and Skyrim SE. They use global blocking and this is... Well, madness.
---

---
To go to the vendor.
---
Sweet sweet justice... I love it.  Keep it coming Bethesda!
---
They fucked me and everyone else over who paid full price for this game.  
---
Im so fucking glad they are making it playable.  
---
Fuck them. Still  a decent game.
---
That’s exactly what I’m saying, Rockstar delayed RDR2 by almost a year and a half because they felt it wasn’t good enough, why Bethesda couldn’t do this to an obviously unfinished game just screams to me that they were just money hungry and didn’t give a single thought about the consumer
---
I've scoured the internet for screw locations only one really pops up and it's only good for about 20 a day. 
---
Only time I played in a party a level 83 started a PvP with a lvl 120 and then the PvP 120 turned on me, one shot me and proceeded to take all my junk.. which was at least 35-40 military ammo bags/duct tape plus bunch of other stuff.  0/10 will not party again.
---
I know your pain. 
---
Yeah...and doing ALL of them is a very significant chunk of content.
---
My second personality doesn't commit any murders. It's not fair that he should go to jail. 
---
Not sure but it's definitely frustrating to know what could take you hundreds or tries can be only a few for someone else more fortunate than you.
---
Yes he was and no I didn't. I wanted to go to the vendor. Where he was camping.
---
More embarrassing than anything else. Hopefully nobody saw the level 80-something blackbird power armor clad, explosive rifle weukdung dude running away screaming from a level 5 glow roach. 
---
Yeah but try that at level 5 when PvP becomes active. New players can get overwhelmed easily.
---
One of the starter missions at Flatwoods should go through how to best find and craft ammo. It's like the responders just assume any Joe or Sue already know how to craft ammo, but can't figure out how to cook a steak. Wtf? 
---
Many people don't even know what exactly is wrong and right with the game. Hell, many of these youtubers don't even properly understand what content is in the game. They just feed each other unverified information to the point where they believe that every negative information about Fo76 must be *right* because *everyone knows* how terrible the game is. This leads to them cherry-picking negative reddit posts without (again) verifying them, while ignoring the frequent moments where the community *is* happy with the state of the game or at least the recent patch.
---
And the double standards these people (and in result many redditors) use are not even funny. When talking about RDR2 it is basically not allowed to mention how employees were abused during its development, because *it's unrelated to the quality of the game*. Yet when quality of Fo76 is discussed, people love to add the canvas bad fiasco and the personal info fiasco to the list of issues. When talking about bugs, they like to point out that it's *unexcusable* to have an AAA game this buggy. Yet pointing out that FNV was even more buggy is somehow wrong. Wrong because FNV was fun to play, they say? Well than why the hell do they keep saying that having fun in Fo76 is not a valid argument? There are many examples where these people contradict their own statements and standards. Apparently when it comes to badmouth Fo76, anything is allowed because *everyone knows that the game is bad*.
---
God, in the last year I got to the verge on not calling myself a Trekkie (despite being fan of all Trek). And now I seriously consider no longer calling myself a gamer...
---
Videogames don’t have tops?
---
Dude I've hopped 40 times and seen him ONCE (pre patch as I'm on xbox) I think you were getting extra lucky before 
---
Was experiencing increased lag yesterday too. Figured that since they announced the duping fix before they implemented on console, people have ramped up duping while they still can.
---
padded and dense
---
It's fine. It's technically under energy weapons but does ballistics damage so it doesnt have the other pitfalls. 
---
Faction quests or faction dailies would be fantastic.
---
Im actually part of a group and we had an idea and a couple areas that we could put a town together on but then we realized that we can’t place close together. I know that there are plenty of people that wish the same thing.
---
It may be easier to calculate the distinction by switching it to town if any camps intersect. I’m sure people will find an exploit out of the feature so as long as people can see on a map when any camps intersect they will have some warning at least.
---
&gt;which as stupid as it is really does appeal to violent assholes
---
What the fuck? Enjoying PVP in a game makes me a violent asshole? Classic carebear example here of wanting to change the game to fit his own needs and everyone else be damned. 
---
Fallout isnt supposed to be a hugfest. Its a fucking post nuclear wasteland. 
---
But after the first or 2nd wouldnt you know there's no point of going there anymore unless you wanna die
---
Herd mentality has been working for me, what was the bug?
---
I don’t think I’m ever going to make another character, it’s taken me 76 hours to get my first character to level 67. I spent the first ~45 hours exploring and playing normally, but was only level 17. I then started grinding white springs until I was at a point where I felt I could actually enjoy the game.
---
I’m not going through all that leveling again especially after the nerfs to experience gains. 
---
Explore the map. See a new place? Go explore it and kill everything. Find another new place, repeat.  At lvl 15 stay in the forest region. 25+ head to toxic valley, then ash heap. 35+ for savage divide, and the rest stays scary.
---
Very nice. I liked to put mine on the river. The ambient sounds in the even while sitting by a fire are nice and relaxing.
---
But is it an Bethesda approved mod?
---
You bought a game without waiting to read about how good or bad said game was and now you want a refund because you were impatient? That's not how the world works. If there's no refund policy to begin with, they have no right to refund you your product if you're not satisfied. If there is a refund policy, find it, get lawyers, and go after them. Stop bitching about it on here. 
---
Did you own a workshop by any chance? Afaik, if he sieges your workshop then fast travels to you, you're locked in pvp due to the workshop.
---
about vaults you can read here - [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a1iyzk/datamine\_vaults\_63\_94\_and\_96/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a1iyzk/datamine_vaults_63_94_and_96/)
---
&gt;I can’t wait to see how this game will look a year from now because I can tell that Bethesda isn’t giving up on it because they would have a long time ago. 
---
It was a $60 game. Bethesda shouldn't be thanked for continuing support on a full priced beta. The game should've never been released in the state it was in.
---
Always has been 
---
So like this sub responding by attacking instead of replying to my point.
---
Well aware that this is a game, a game that requires other people to be on the same server as you. And I for one don't want to deal with people who cheat. Also we both know exactly what I meant by the top. 
---
Hit up the BOS bases in the bog. Those green ammo bags are great for it.
---
?
---
I've just bought this on PS4 since the price went right down. Looking forward to starting it sometime even with all the negative comments I see about the game. I gather the game is a lot more fun playing in a group rather than solo?
---
The initial firestorm seems to be dying down. I've seen more talk about the game itself, for bad or good, than stuff going on outside the game, which is encouraging.
---
smokes should have been the currency instead of caps 
---
That's such a moral thing to do despite buying duped guns
---
"they"
---
I also enjoy this game, but I'm not gonna thank Bethesda. They released an unfinished, unbalanced game and I'm happy that they're fixing it now. So I appreciate the work the devs are putting in to make it the game it should've been, but the damage has been done.
---
Interesting, I don't think I ever grinded to get to 68. Got there in about 80 hours through just quests and exploration but I can see why you wouldn't.
---
To all haters....
---
What if..now bare with me here...What if......they couldn't predict these errors until it was fully released to the world? 
---
Which could be why they are listening and patching?
---
I provided a data point to support my claim. Can you provide a data point to support your claim? If not, there's nothing more to talk about.  You can still be of the opinion that ESO is some sort of failure, which is isn't.  People's opinions are wrong all the time. It's no big deal.
---
I know the stuff sticks around when you leave. Not sure how long but I’ve taken the junkyard (unclaimed) and found a handful of turrets, a couple of generators and resource collectors already built.
---
And if you bone a TSE at the bazaar, then you should know that it is very likely you are buying a duped weapon.  Why would anyone sell such an incredibly useful and hard to find item? Because they have 200 more just like it.  
---
How about Bethesda also Fixes losing ammo when you up items?? I've lost expensive ammo quite a lot do to this...
---
It could have been a high level passing through, or a high level claimed it and left passing ownership to the low levels of his squad. Or a bug.
---
throw a prime receiver and you could probably just snipe every scorched in 1 shot
---
Yes you can.
---
I duped power armor by accident in the first week of launch. I picked up a second power armor chassis and went to whitespring to use the workbench for it. I placed both chassis down and put one extra leg armor I had on the empty one. Then I took all my pieces off the first and applied then to the second. I picked up both and placed one down again. In a moment of confusion I think I tried to place the one with all the armor on it but placed the empty one and got into it. Somehow I had armor on it once stepping into it. It duped somehow and I have no clue how I did it exactly, but that's what happened. Eventually I tried to repeat the process but after placing the second chassis down and unequiping it, I could not pick up the chassis anymore. So I ended up with 2 of everything with 1 equipped chassis.
---
You're good. I was being a bit tongue in cheek. The people in trouble are just sitting there duping stuff over and over. 
---
Maybe not. Its still lucrative. Plus its one of the only times I've seen friendly social activity on a scale bigger than just a side team-up with a rando. I like the community vibe and push to talk scene in whitesprings. So hopefully they continue from time to time.
---
Please be advised.
---
When items are named the following mechanics are needed:
---
1. An interface to allow users to do so.(the easy part)
---
2. Separation. Because the servers have been logging the PA frames as the "same item" this is much more compact data wise than the server remembering everyones unique named inputs for each item.
---
If you have ever noticed dropping alot of items, or removing a lot of things from your stash at one time begins to lag. This is the kind of lag they are preventing. Every interaction you play is made on your console, compacted and submitted to their server for storage.
---
In an even simpler sense its like the difference between finding an item in a messy bedroom compared to an organised one.
---
Isn't the DLC for this game going to be free? Just genuinely trying to remember lol.
---
They blocked everyone they found with cheat engine. Not just you. If you want special treatment, you need to ask FIRST. You made a mistake, not them.
---
Just a random super mutant lege
---
Wow thanks for screwing the pooch in that one Ivan
---
I cant understand why the storage list is causing server lag, if i play Ark i have mods which let me store more items i fill boxes in my base along with my tribe and all the other tibes on the server and their server is fine, most servers lag with player interactions all happening too fast. Maybe over time this will improve and there might be room for this.
---
It’s not so much you’re “playing wrong” as the game clearly wasn’t built for you to have 30 variations of every item in the game at all times. 
---
Why is it so hard to adapt? **We’re all** used to being able to store everything we find (and never ever use or touch any of it), some of us are making it work, others just can’t seem to adjust. 
---
Yeah, I don’t have an armory of 5,000 weapons anymore, but even when I did 4,995 of them just collected dust. 
---
If I find a better version of the weapon I’m using, I sell or give away the old one. Once I find a 3 star Furious Power Fist I’m *never* going to use that 1 Star Ghoul Slayers Power Fist again, and it doesn’t drive me nuts that I can’t have it rotting in a box for eternity. 
---
&gt;nt na
---
Please post more to help Bethesda through this difficult time.
---
My rate of disconnects seemed the same as pre-patch, at least 5, but not all were CTD.  One CTD was in Whitespring while checking corpses, just after I found a two shot something I hadn't inspected yet.  Start the anxiety...
---
Relieved to discover on restart it was still there, a 2 shot/1 star LMG.  Don't know if I'll keep it, though.  Nice DPS but heavy for my current build and keeping up with the ammo is a chore.
---
Nice lakeside cottage and photo!
---
I would never put real money into it because its so inflated. But every week I just hop in and see if theres anything funny I can guy.  Bought new flooring and one of my friends was like "OMG where'd you get this flooring"  You'da thought I remodeled my actual kitchen.
---
Yes!
---
Can you post a screenshot that shows your crafting menu for a casual underarmor showing you have the Protective Lining and the Shielded Lining?
---
I understand where you’re coming from (I didn’t downvote you by the way, I always support people speaking their mind during a discussion) and the game was so obviously unfinished, like their previous games have came out in sort of buggy states but it wasn’t to the point where it would stop anyone from buying the game, this game had so many bugs to the point where it completely ruined the experience and what was a $60 game felt more like a $30 early access title.
---
Another thing that sort of upsets me is that this is the first game where they actually would’ve had to put the tiniest amount of effort into post-launch and they didn’t do it until the community got upset, the other games modders would always cover their asses and fix their bugs for them but that was obviously not the case with this game because it’s online and they still didn’t feel like they should’ve put some effort into it to fix all of their issues
---
You have to re log
---
This one account that only posts about fo76 said it!
---
I will try to contact them by phone, and at the same time I will look, maybe someone of my friends knows how to get through the first line of support.
---
While 21:9 still has a long way to go, I'm glad to see it's not forgotten in these patches.
---
I’m a 21 yo college student, btw
---
Like this -&gt; Search all accounts, inquiry quantity wood/steel/insert popular dupe item here. If the qty is great than x flag the account. Then all an actual person has to do is go through the flags and see hmmm XxNoSc0p3420xX has 10,261 steel in his inventory. Probably duped. Ban and wait for repeal if ever.
---
FINALLY
---
I was able to complete it yesterday, I figured because of the new patch maybe.  Perhaps I was just lucky.
---
You just get them. Most require you to visit a specific location to trigger the quest. Like if you finished the quest line at Camden Park, then any time you visit the region around Camden you'll get a daily quest to do one of the games for the tokens. 
---
I'm glad you agree
---
I'm on PS4.....last evening the same happened to me except I went back in to see tick tock....server going off line for maintenance.    Hopefully this will be fixed soon. 
---
Yes!  I went there for the first time yesterday when scouting the area (previously undiscovered but marked locations).  I did have a legendary super mutant that of course dropped a 1 star scrap armor piece, but I did find a grip of recipes and a couple of plans while searching around.  Left there with 4 previously undiscovered items.
---
Agreed. They know who the dupers are, but doing patch management based on resources availability (tiger teams) and volatility impact.
---
Every cloud based item is a resource that’s identified, tracked and managed. It’s how S3/AWS and azure make money, rampant mismanagement.
---
Yeah we had a private server last night too! It was so peaceful! And one of our friends loaded in but no one else did. None of us were level 50 yet so we just went and claimed workshops to farm plans. 
---
I fully expected this to be a rickroll.   Glad it wasn't!
---
&gt; We play on a PvE server. I claim the Charleston landfill and Poseidon Energy workshops. You want those junk extractors and the fusion core processor. Tough shit, they're taken, and your only option of contesting them is out. Some other asshole is sitting on Thunder Mountain, and another group has taken Monongah. No fusion cores for you (or anyone else).
---
sure, you can take them until you log off. Plenty of people know how that you get more than enough fusion cores from other places.
---
PS4
---
Finally...fuck them guys..I wont buy tse....I'll find them off corpse
---
Bit like sea of thieves
---
Well yeah, all the YouTubers reporting on this sensationalize it because this controversy can bring a shit ton of viewers their way. I agree that the coverage was pretty extreme but that doesn’t change the fact that Bethesda as a publisher has made some really shitty decisions
---
The caps trophy seems to pop once you hit 10000 caps COLLECTED.  It doesnt have to be all at the same time, not sure if thats what they intended.  
---
ALSO  
---
I offer a personal crash test dummy service where I jump off a cliff for 100 caps per revive, if interested.  
---
PSN: Counterpointa
---
Sorry I didn't mean you lose the food out of your stash. The plants themselves disappear and remaking them means using up food.
---
Let me break this down for you. 
---
*We don’t fucking care that you’re leaving. Goodbye, don’t let the door hit you on your way out and good luck.* I genuinely hope you find a game you find more enjoyable. 
---
What we do care about, however, is people constantly posting annoying complaints and that they’re leaving. Okay? Cool? Again it’s not really our concern, but when you start posting on a public platform and start involving the whole community, then yes, we do start to care; in the sense that this is unnecessary and annoying. 
---
When you break up with your girlfriend/boyfriend, do you preach to Reddit and ask everyone else to break up with their significant other too? 
---
I don't care that they killed me, it's the fact that that they are so cocky I find stupid.
---
I completely agree, i would very much love a dueling feature in the game for against friends and even random people. 
---
learn recipes, 3 out of 76... even though I have 40+ duplicates in my inventory that I can;t read again
---
More often than not they don't turn up, done it a few times and it worked, twice as many times it hasn't worked, also seen newbies running around for ages looking confused...
---
If we got this, we need camp territory to be square rather than circles to connect them perfectly
---
Was thinking about creating a new character but didn't want to follow the same routine. Might try you method, sounds like fun. 
---
Yeah the release was balls, but most hate i see has nothing to do with release, its assholes saying they should work faster and come out with more fixes faster. 
---
I feel like duping, free items for no work is a communist thing. 
---
So close but I'd imagine it would be a pro capitalist message. Lol regardless. 
---
Almost forget, these were the tracks used:
---
Fallout 1 - Acolytes of a New God:https://youtu.be/T8j_KgAgOnw
---
The Dark Knight - Why so Serious: https://youtu.be/jHBBoQYrUjw
---
To be totally fair, you can’t blame people for wanting a working product when they buy it. I think the game looks amazing and I hope to get it one day, but if I bought a game tomorrow and it was crashing and glitching and whatever else, it’d definitely turn me against it. Let’s just hope this is another No Mans Sky (which I bought and love), and that this time next year it’s a perfect Fallout experience 
---
Never gotten an addiction. Though I never use drugs apart from stims and once in a blue moon I’ll have a beer if I have one in my inventory and need an extra 5 carry weight. So it’s kind of expected. 
---
Couldn’t you have multiple toons based on build? 
---
Holding off on advancing my tank till I get my stealth toon lvld up.
---
if you read further, and to the general point of the article, there are other polls that offer differing numbers, and since most gun owners own multiple guns, it's hard to put a definite answer to how many households actually own guns. 
---
And AKs are illegal in 90% of the states, so learning how to field strip them wouldn't do us much good anyways. 
---
Unfortunately US schools don't do much in the way of actual life education, and that's something we all would definitely benefit from
---
I don't suppose you know if it always has the same pieces on it or if its random?
---
The communist Chinese made the atom store to make us hate capitalism. Buy $700 worth of atoms to show them they can't stop us!
---
Had a comment war with a guy who made duplicating glitch videos.  his youtube is Zeus , please ban him.
---
*which thanks to today's patch fixing, they're not going to be able to recover*
---
**Might** not be able to recover.
---
Find the lookouts and climb to the top and do a “survey.” This will add sites to your map for you to discover.
---
I'm surprised this isn't getting more attention. This is yet another big problem.
---
You like staring at little kids? So that's why you're on probation!
---
Same here, never had an addiction and man I've popped a lot of phsyco now it's kinda crazy. 
---
Do you have evidence of it crashing the server because I havent seen any.  If it crashed the server the glitch wouldn't work.
---
Low level appropriately geared players can contribute if they choose to do so.
---
Tag the Queen from time to time to ensure they get loot then take out the rabble so we can concentrate on unloading ordinance on Her face without distractions.
---
With willing participants and a bit of coordination it has worked for me in the past.
---
Sure, makes the fight longer and more expensive but at least everyone gets to contribute.
---
Most people get a dopamine release from feeling that they are making a useful contribution and very few get the same reward mechanism triggered by feeling that they conned someone else to get something for nothing at their expense.
---
Considering that there is no way to 'ringfence' the event I consider this a fair compromise.
---
Until Bethesda run an item ID scan on people inventories and wonder where you got yours.
---
That's always been a bullshit excuse.
---
Stash limits are purely artificial limits for game balance or more likely so people will buy ATOM points to upgrade game limits.
---
It's like imagining your gonna hit the lottery with that ticket. Chances are this isn't real but it still feels good to think there is some balance in the world.
---
My apologies, I am not as invested in lore as I am rather with the games mechanics. I just wanted to briefly address it to acknowledge the work Bethesda has done to address a MASSIVE list of demands.
---
I wouldn't want to stop anyone more informed on the lore from correcting me. Thankyou for your contribution.
---
Just “drop” your power armor to show it off. I promise that I won’t steal it...
---
Yeah I didn't really plan my build the first time around, ignored power armor till level 40 or so and fast traveled a little too often I think.
---
Yes, that in itself is a fun killer. 
---
A kind soul gave me 1000 rounds of 5mm last night . Bless them 
---
The error is not that they blocked me. The mistake is to distribute bans based on the fact that there are some software on the computer. Without investigation, without anything.
---
In a good way, if your anti-cheat is configured this way, you can first warn players and give time to remove either the game or these programs. It was unexpected. That is the problem and their mistake. And as if this is not enough, they do not give any opportunity to resolve this misunderstanding. To consider your client a fraud by default is an insult.
---
Seriously, the technical support of the FREE Warframe is communicating with the players so that they explain why they have this or that software on their computer. While the technical support of AAA-game bans for no reason and is silent in response to questions.
---
Sell 'em to vendors.
---
Logged in after the patch, went to whitesprings, first ghoul I killed was legendary, dropped a legendary hunting rifle... 1* assassins. 
---
so I found out what they're doing for some reason  100% reduce damage is possible in the game with 4 or 3 party member with empathy mutation (with strange in numbers perk card) some armor mod that i don't yet and I think fire proof for some reason it breaks the game Reduce damage that's why even if you attack them their HP keeps on going back and you can't kill them...
---
They make canes right in Fallout.
---
I'm a Raider. I *live* on probation.
---
I agree, its more challenging as well. I mostly play solo because I just dont have a group of friends who play but I love the idea of wandering out of the vault on my own trying to make it. 
---
Not really sure why you got downvoted here for just giving an honest answer. 
---
If you're bored with the game then that's how it is. 
---
I still have fun doing things and playing with a friend of mine, but my circumstances are different. I usually only have a couple days a week to play. 
---
The people who are defending the game have every right to do so, just as the people who are disappointed have every right to express that disappointment. 
---
Everyone has different standards of what they think a game should be like. There is always a sweet spot somewhere in there but a lot of people will be at opposite ends of this spectrum and it shows. 
---
If you really think about it critically, you should not be able to defend how the game was released. It was objectively sloppy by gaming standards. I say objectively but really that's just my opinion that some do not share. I just think the reasons that people defending give are bad ones, but I applaud them for trying to keep a positive attitude about the game. 
---
Like I said before: I have my complaints, but I want to see the game progress. The potential is huge for this game and I wish all the best for Bethesda with it in the future. 
---
There are plenty of fantastic human NPCs - they are dead - but they are fantastic.  Abbie might be one of my favorite characters in Fallout history.
---
It exists. It's called Hunter/Hunted mode. Shame that no one actually knows about it or bothers to use it.
---
&gt;Plenty of people know how that you get more than enough fusion cores from other places
---
Not anymore. Fusion core processors now produce a full fusion core every 7.5 minutes. That's a pretty damn good rate if you'd ask me.
---
I'm just tired of just grinding for levels and getting better legendaries. I went through all the quests, read all terminals and notes and loved all the stories but now...it's like WoW...do your dailies, grind the nuke zones...for me, it's just boring.  I'm not the type of player that makes the end game a priority, I need more activities to do, give me more choices.  I know they will come but for now, I am going back to Dying Light and  Fallout 4 and will continue my new games I started.  But I can't wait to see the future content for Fo76.
---
It is worse, the infinite loading is much worse, never had it before, I had it 4 times last night after that's what they claim they fixed.
---
Performance is improved running around the Encalve bunker etc however...
---
I hope your Bethesda account and reddit account gets banned.
---
Console player. I have to wait around for a patch.
---
Not an actual unmarked camp site or base but I have build an elevated camp inside the structure of an Transmission tower close to the Whitesprings train station. The frame of the tower functions as outer wals and I discovered that almost nothing can shoot trough them from the ground level. 
---
It's because hes completely right. Had people not made a stink, there's no way Betheada would have put half of this effort or money into fixing this game. 
---
I think lvl 3 should let you get more from weapons and armor then just wood steel and leather
---
The game has almost no optimization and was released with proper testing/QA.
---
It doesn't matter what setup or internet connection you use, the servers and client will crash regularly.
---
I know this sounds like a bad take, but you should have just avoided or bounced servers.  RN people are looking to make their own fun in a broken system and push the limits of what they can exploit.  It's growing pains for this really new game system.  Sorry you had a crap time. don't let this nonsense get to you.
---
"*barely* done any duping....*recently*"...but other people are doing it way more. 
---
Sounds like an admission to me.
---
You missed the point.. You were the one saying you'd outrun me while I was over encumbered. I'm just trying to tell you its nothing new you're using. It still is way slower moving around like that vs normal running. And for real lol.. why would you need 8 chasis lol
---
Just out of curiousity, what level are you atm?
---
I had an extremely boring discussion with someone who ended up saying:
---
&gt; The game was designed for Multiplayer. It was meant to be played multiplayer obviously Single player is going to be a lesser experience. 
---
They were utterly unable to accept that anyone could have a different opinion.
---
Weird.
---
They have a LOT of players. each server holds very few players. they can spin up and spin down servers as needed.
---
If they decide that they want 20ish people per server, then they can do that, by not spinning up servers when they have servers which have less than 20 people.
---
The moment all the servers have 20 people, they can spin up a new one, and start filling it with people.
---
It isn't that they OWN the tin the servers are running on, they don't pay anything if they are not using them.
---
&gt; So your proving a personal opinion with an unreliable data point.
---
The data point is directly from the company. 2.5 million active monthly payers in December of 2017. That's a fact.
---
&gt;opinions cannot be wrong
---
Yes, yes they can. Opinions can absolutely be wrong. Don't go through life feeling otherwise.  
---
&gt;Learn to form your own without biased data and feedback loops.
---
This sentence doesn't mean anything.  It's gibberish hacked together to sound smart.  
---
But if you want to sound smart, give me a data point on ESO.  Prove to me with some sort of fact that ESO is a failure, or at least, unpopular MMO.
---
They should probably fix this but I guess there more concerned with all the glitches and stability
---
Aid and ammo add up fast, cull those? 
---
Love it too, but that's why I'm worried.
---
There are so many glitches and major issues in the programming of the game that they will need to spend the next couple months ironing out those issues, fixing the cheating, and bringing the game up to a more stable state, instead of being able to buff and Nerf Things based on community content, and add new content to keep people playing in the late game.
---
I'm worried that by the time all the bugs are worked out and they start adding new content that most of the players who love the game like me will just be burnt out.
---
Fingers crossed!
---
Also placing PA down to jump into and it takes a good 20 - 30 seconds to appear on screen...
---
I’ve been trying to do this for a month but can’t for the life of me get enough black titanium to make the armor pieces. Very frustrating.
---
Main difference with Sea of Thieves is that it felt like they just didn't put much in the way of replayability though while fun, I played a couple betas with friends and by then we'd had all the fun we could've and buying it seemed like we'd do too much of the same shit for no real end game
---
Too many people think only in binary. For them it's either love something or hate something. They don't understand the possible nuances in the communication with the developer. We can surely be angry about the state of the game on release while still be happy for the patches Bethesda provides. What reaction is appropriate for a good patch if not thankfulness? The right idea is that if you are critical for an issue in the game, then you should be positive when the issue gets fixed. If people act negatively at first and then remain negative even when fixes are coming, what's the point of having these fixes then (from the POV of Bethesda). If fixes and other kinds of post-launch support don't buy you goodwill, then what's the point?
---
This attitude of "reward the good, punish the bad" is the appropriate attitude in many walks of life. It's proper when raising a child, it's proper when training a dog, it's correct for a boss -&gt; emplyee relationship. If the company heard only negative, abusive messages from the community then it would be only understandable if they went "screw those guys" and went away...
---
Claim workshops and do power-up events
---
My opinion : I think they had a publishing deadline had to weigh the cost of missing that (which meant missing xmas sales, marketing expenses/reduced hype etc), versus releasing a game they knew wasnt retail ready and the backlash from that. 
---
Ultimately the executive decision up top, was that the public know their games are released buggy, so to release the game as planned (expecting that to be the better and more profitable of the 2 options).
---
What they may not have anticipated is just how much backlash and negative feedback the game recieved. Im sure they expected releasing it unfinished and on time, was going to be the most profitable option (and maybe it still was?).
---
As a coder, I cant help but feel that the dev team knew how much work still needed to be done, but were at the mercy of the corporate $$ machine at the top. When you spend so many grueling hours, days, weeks, months and years on a project like this (doing something you love), to see people talking trash about, that has to hurt. It wasn't finished.
---
I think the dev team has done a great job and I love this game. It wasnt finished and they knew it and the coporate money $$ machine up top is at fault here, so the frustration should be aimed in that direction.
---
Just my opinion. 
---
I honestly feel like some one higher up told the developers that they needed the game finished before the holiday season, even though the devs knew it wouldn't be ready by then.
---
I’m not going to argue. However, you deserve the work they’re putting in. They deserve zero thanks for it. We bought a broken shitpile of a mess, paid damn good money for it too. If they were not fixing these bugs then their reputation would have nose dived even lower than it already is.
---
Add me with my same name here - happy to show you.
---
It just happens sometimes.  A world of Lv. 1 Molerats suddenly gives way to a wave of Lv. 50 Gutsys.
---
It makes little sense and it's very inconsistent.
---
I don’t think You can mod hazmat suits.
---
What do you mean? Like interchange all the cards with one character?
---
Bummer, PC here or I'd offer to help.
---
How does the hazmat suit let you remain permanently hidden?
---
Using armor with stealth perks, sure, but I'm missing something here.
---
True, nobody intentionally exploiting will be turned away with a warning. They’ll assume bs or that it’s not possible to catch them till it happens.
---
Would probably help immensely if the npcs talked more with each other. Chally doesn't count because she doesn't actually reply with anything understandable. Bethesda should learn a bit from Half-Life. Noticed how there is usually always two npcs when an npc need Gordon to do something? That way they can have the second npc ask the questions that the player would have if he could, without making the dialog feel weird. 
---
Do robots ever talk to each other in the Fallout universe? Or do they communicate in binary?
---
But thats just a small detail, and I enjoy the game even without it. Just have to read more. And could need a character wiki because i suck at remembering names. Who's Erik? And where did I read about Taggardy last? Oh, there's two different Maxsons..
---
Depends. I wouldn't pay more than $20 for this title.
---
Even with the latest patch the game client and server are extremely unstable and unreliable. You will probably experience many crashes, disconnections and game breaking bugs.
---
Maybe after a few months things will be better, but if you're going to buy it now you should be aware of stability issues facing this title.
---
The downvoting is a little uncalled for, just having an adult rational discussion. Nothing to see here
---
Collect wood works - it's just how many times you've collected it, not how much wood you've collected.  So you've interacted with 274 wood piles.
---
I wouldn't say they weren't putting effort in post-launch, they just weren't vocal enough about it. The community is extremely demanding when it comes to communication and Bethesda didn't anticipate that, so they didn't acknowledge things fast enough. You could say they didn't prepare. In another massively downvoted comment of mine I said ... "It's almost as if they didn't consult someone about what to expect."
---
Funny how whether I'm saying good OR bad things about this game it's downvoted because I don't preface it with a copout like: "playing devil's advocate"
---
Of course there is this Reddit negativity trend, like this is where everyone comes to be a negative Nancy and complain. Even to the point where if a patch was released to fix something people would complain about the patch size!!!
---
Well, let's look at it logically: The game was released in a very bug filled state, nigh incomplete, now they're fixing it. Pretty quickly too when you think about the sheer amount of fixes required lol.
---
Love the downvotes, what fickle beings the finger warriors are. 
---
Probably only because the fixed the bug that made all the robots spawn?
---
Yeah, I definitely agree that it was more at the fault of Bethesda as a publisher rather than Bethesda as a developer
---
Server stability was pretty awful for me last night and the servers I visited all seemed underpopulated, like people weren't able to stick around for long.  I haven't seen too many posts this morning corroborating that, though.
---
You raiders are all the same
---
Again it's not an issue of server cost, it's an issue of splitting the playerbase. If you split the playerbase into PVP and PVE servers you run the risk of one community completely dying out earlier than the other. Keeping the playerbase together means that less people would be likely to burn out and leave, since the content is curtailed ones for both groups at the same time instead of one for either at separate times (you also save on update costs and sustaining low overhead costs which is the goal from a business perspective).
---
They got boiled water down at least
---
All good ideas that will never be implemented, sadly. I do miss my Bobble Head and Magazine displays :(
---
-CH
---
&gt;I mean if I was duping and got banned
---
Exactly. Why are you going to announce to the entire Reddit community that you were banned for being a cheating bastard. You shrug, probably make some sort of self-justification that you only exploited because the game was trash and you're better off being banned so you're no longer "forcing" yourself to play it, and move on.
---
Star Wars Galaxies implemented a "[Player city](http://swg.wikia.com/wiki/Player_city)" feature which allowed towns to provide specialized buffs to people within the town, you held elections for the mayor, and could build special "player city only" buildings like cantinas, vehicle repair shops, and shuttleports.  Unfortunately with the player limit per server this wouldn't really work, but a smaller implementation of it may be possible?
---
My best memories of SWG were when player cities were implemented.  Maybe in the future Bethesda can expand the environment and allow more players on the map at one time (after more vaults are opened or something).  Or better yet establish a vault type of system where the "city" is just a vault players can take over/claim separately from their C.A.M.P.  That would allow you to enter the instanced vault/zone regardless of server and explore other "guilds" cities/vaults.
---
hahah yes, always springs. gimme ur connect. just wandering the map unlocking locations and collecting the springs. i've levelled up so much just looking for springs, now all the quests are ruined too XD
---
I noticed that I had like a hundred mutfruit plants one time and I definitely didn’t make them. I don’t know how to even do the glitch. Hopefully I won’t get banned...
---
[Every vendor transaction](https://gfycat.com/UnfinishedBiodegradableGreatwhiteshark).
---
There’s one inherent problem with that argument; we can’t provide you a refund. You’re preaching into the wind. 
---
As far as emotional support goes; that’s a pretty lame cop-out excuse. Nobody needs emotional support for a video game refund. Nice try though.  
---
&gt;  Or maybe you planted your crops and moved your camp but it didn’t put the food back due to geometry issues?
---
This. I've never successfully gotten them back.
---
You could do one of the several vs events
---
No way! 30% to scorchbeast is great
---
Really? Then insted of banning paying costumers dont they fix the game???
---
Snacks... I want snacks!!

Cloud hosted solutions require separate APIs for each instance.
---
You need to build a software connection for every platform, for each hosted DB.
---
1 for pc, 1 for xb1, 1 for PS4 and so on. 
---
I've seen more and more people saying this. I was going to make a post about it also as the same has been happening to me. 
---
They've definitely done something to the rate of which they go down. And they need to officially address it so we can be certain
---
You mean 12.5 kg.  That is a 27.6 pound machine gun
---
And with perks anyone can carry far more than the 600lb stash anyways, it's ridiculously low. At least it isnt 400 but still. 
---
Well, to be fair, every previous Bethesda release was also plagued with bugs and problems, but it never hurt sales. They didn't have much reasons to think it would be much different this time.
---
I mean even during the "beta" there was still plenty of people claiming that it was just a beta and things would be fixed at release.
---
I gotcha. Sorry to misunderstand you, and I hope you feel better.
---
I think it is because I had a level 90 player hitting me with All Rise when I was level 20 and the regen from eating a steak was able to heal faster than they could damage me. 
---
If you decide to buy, buy on a separate account. Not to the one to which their other games are linked via Steam (Skyrim, Fallout 4 and so on).
---
The current policy of bans may end up in that you lose access to everything you bought before, simply because you have programs installed on your computer that seem suspicious to them.
---
&gt; Hang on a sec... if this is really there. I am calling crap on raising the stash by 200 being a serious problem for server stability. There are more items in that place than all of the players on a server put together.
---
Did they ever remove the cap on vendor caps? Because if they didn't, the "server stability" is probably vendors running out of their daily caps.
---
He's not any better, he said plenty of negative toxic things about Fallout 76. Ban him too
---
Yeah for me it hasn't gotten any better.  
---
Anytime I do a SBQ I always team request anyone I can just so I have a connect back to the same server when it inevitably crashes lol 
---
The true endgame lol. Thanks for watching.
---
I hope they add more to the Cult in future updates, I love the concept, but it is a bit barebones now.
---
Glad they’re cleaning up the mess they created!
---
Don’t buy it for the full price, look for it somewhere else cheap. But keep in mind, grinding this game is fun af but this comes at price occasional lag, freezing and crashing. 
---
Alrighty. Ill be available in a few hours. Not on now. 
---
I'll see if I can get some fancy lad snack cakes.
---
I made something similar

My fellow muties would disagree!
---
Badass farming for plans is a pain in the ass
---
Outside of suits that are quest rewards, power armor spawns are pretty much always random.
---
I mean, that's the thing, I guess. There's more to power armor than the listed numbers. Because by the numbers, my dr/er is about the same out of power armor as it is in, but things that would just tickle my team mates in PA, absolutely wreck me. Even still though, work blocker and serendipity, I *should* be tanky as hell, but instead I'm the one always waving my arms for a revive.
---
Other people have mentioned this.  I did notice myself being thirsty seemingly out of the blue once yesterday, but I didn't look deeper into it at the time.
---
There are two robots (handy models) who you find randomly, they seem to be boy and girl (voice wise) and I think they are stuck in a conversation loop. Kinda funny, totally weird. But still amusing. 
---
Thanks trying to power through work today so I can get home and binge 76 tonight. The wife is at her mother's tonight so it's going to be me with a pizza, case of beer and 76 all night. 
---
This is all it took? Imo, they’ve got more to do before I care
---
Good to see, that they took action! I hope this will continue and the economy will recover.
---
Bethesda! Create tools and get rid of the items! No matter what! Thanks!!
---
OCD logic was my brain hurting :(
---
I have noticed that crashes and disconnects after this last patch are back to 2nd patch levels. Seems like every patch is always 1 step forward, 2 steps back.
---
Yeah just an unfortunate learning experience 
---
It's for the greater good
---
What platform? PC is super active on my playtime’s. Any nuke gets 10+ players lvl 50+

You access it by going to your radio tab and clicking on Hunter/Hunted radio. You also can manually cancel the quest at any time.

Same with me
---
PS4 has been blue-screening like crazy the last week.  Something about Watoga Train Station is doing it.  Prior to this week it was quite rare.
---
I'm just getting constant freezes. Game comes back to life eventually but it just keeps freezing every so often.
---
LOL not worth their time or money.
---
Didn't think there was any DLC as such, Just updates. 
---
I’m not a raider! I’m a person who gives abandoned power armors a home. I adopt them...like a nice person
---
Yes, but those are not up all the time, have the chance of other players joining in, and, if you're messing with builds and weapons, are not practicle every time you and a buddy want to test something out real quick.
---
I like the versus events for what they are, but in this situation a private way between two or more people to acknowledge cap free PVP would be much more beneficial.
---
Yup, I definitely noticed it. Didn't play much yesterday, but I logged in in the Mire, filled up, and slowboated (overencumbered) to Whitesprings, and not even halfway there I was already at half-thirst. Seemed very high to me. And that character doesn't have Speed Demon, never has. 
---
My mistake. I thought that was low but I just glanced real at it real quick.
---
It seems like it would be pretty immersion breaking to have multiple PC's walking around the world with identical human companions. So it seems like if you want companions you'd have to make them something that would be reasonable in-game to replicate, like robots. Having customizable robot companions would be fun, though. You could find and download different personalities and hunt down mods to give them different capabilities. Maybe even have some equivalent to perk cards so you could configure your companion for melee vs. ranged vs. healing or other utility.
---
Animal companions, like Dogmeat, would also work.
---
The only way I could see to have human companions would be if Bethesda added instanced areas where you'd have a companion for the duration of your stay, like a lone survivor in a newly opened vault. But that would still break down if you went in with a team, unless the companion just attached themselves to the team as a whole. But that doesn't seem to be the direction they really want to go with the game.
---
Only if it's an atom shop paint. I had a friend paint my T-51 in the nuka cola paint before i got the plans for it, and that stayed cuz that's in the base game.
---
So nothing to do with the patch, which is not yet out for PS4.
---
&gt; You’re following a quest line
---
No you aren't, you are picking up recordings of someone else's quests.  She talks about the things she encountered and the people she met.  You just listen.  
---
There is no story to survive, it is just some meters that affect your AP regen if you totally neglect them for hours per playthrough.
---
I prefer solo too, but I have fun with my friends most of the time, we take time to read terminals and delve into the lore, the problem is that they want to go to the places they went with their solo characters, like, why can't we just explore? Go in directions we didn't go before, actually get that sense of adventure, instead they just lead me through places they've already been. And then my other friend is the one that wants to hit end level as fast as possible, which is just boring.
---
Wait they keep the stacked perks forever?
---
So we're in agreement that my example proved you wrong. ESO did, in fact, release information on subsribers. As of December 2017, they had 2.5 million monthly users, which puts them at the top of the heap. On that note, I can also reference Steam's "Best of 2018" lists, which put ESO in their Platinum level for best sellers.

…I violated a given ToS that has been changed without any kind of notification or warning. Once again — these are working tools. If tomorrow they decide to block those who have Visual Studio installed (after all, there is a debugger in it), will it also be the fault of those who write code on their home computer?

True....lol
---
Yeah FO76 is the only subreddit there is huh?
---
You got some ego thinking I was ever speaking to you.
---
I have signed up for this almost every single time I have logged on for the last week and a half, and not a single time has more than two people ever been queued up for it, including myself.
---
As in some of my other replies as well, this is a great way to do some PVP, but not practical if you and the buddy are just trying to test out some bills or different strategies.
---
Um. Yeah. Ok. I know. That's why I posted this. Maybe you accidentally commented in the wrong place?
---
Not really, I’ve got a VATS sniper with good perception and I found a level 35 2shot lever action with vats accuracy and crit gain, it still works pretty well in vats. It ain’t perfect, but it is definitely worth using in vats.
---
Just depends on your build and what other effects you’ve got.
---
Yeah I was literally just scrapping broken armour because I couldn’t repair 
---
Youre both fucking losers. Git gud fucking scrubs
---
Sounds like you've got a shitty router.  Maybe replace it.
---
First patch after they confirm duping is solved: “Items maximum levels are now 55 and 60, mobs loot tables have been adjusted to this.” and problem “solved”.
---
It just needs more awareness. 
---
It may be a clever way to keep people interested in the game. Regular updates? Listening to the fans? It’s giving us small milestones to look forward to. As well as fixing annoying bugs. I personally am excited for new content. Not just small fixes and upgrades to current gameplay. 
---
&gt;... you have no role and there is no story for you to play...
---
So, never mind that we pick up the pieces of the other fallen groups. We &gt;!finish the vaccination for the scorched plague!&lt;, &gt;!set up the scorch detection system!&lt;, &gt;!reconnect MODUS to the orbital satellite!&lt;, &gt;!become a general in the US Army so that we can gain acces to nuclear capability!&lt;, &gt;!and the drop said nukes all over the place to end said scorched plague!&lt;. But no, we don't have a role to play in this game at all. We're just going through the motions...
---
I figured that you meant that.  I WISH it was 13lbs!!  But then again it is a solid shooting platform that doesn't move around like the M60 did, and I am sure weight helps that out
---
Exactly. I completely understand having a penalty to help discourage trolling or griefing, but if two people both want to fight each other and agree that no one needs to lose any caps, there is no reason people should be penalized for a little healthy competition, or even a little combat research.
---
It has to just be me then. I haven't seen one in the bunker, dyer chemcial or sugar grove. Maybe i've succeeded in destroying them.
---
Mine used to be around 580-600, then I started bulking items and selling them off, that got me down to 500 (+-), then I started scrapping/selling the weapons I don't use and last night I was down to 403...……...now after the Queen and the other mutations I am back up to 600 with more on me. so I have to do the whole bulking and sell off tonight. 
---
Overall it took me about 4 days, I am usually on for only a couple hours a night. It is doable.
---
I live in a resource dense area, and use a variety of guns, not all of which need to same materials to repair. Did you know the dragon is literally steel + adhesives to repair and nothing else, it's insane, and the bp rifle is about the same + wood. 
---
The only repair perk I run is artisan, no gunsmith, no makeshift warrior. I mostly use explosive weapons, broadsiders namely, other heavy weapons are at my disposal. When I want something really dead I drop all my weight perks and become an immobile turret, but otherwise I don't actually run many +damage perks normally except demo expert. Stabilized, enforcer, one gun army, and the +explosion radius are actually the only real weapons related stuff I have equipped regularly. I am more of a tank/support player focused on keeping the team alive by standing between them and all the bad things using my face as a shield.
---
Weapons - 2 50cal, 2 broadsiders, daisy cutter, bunker buster, 5 super sledges, 3 sledge hammers, an auto grenade launcher, 2 handmades, 2 assault rifles, two lever rifles, some revovers, a combat rifle, 4 dragons, 2 BP rifles, 3 bp pistols, 3 machetes, 2 gatling guns, a 10mm smg, 2 10mm pistols, 4 gatling plasmas, a plasma rifle, tesla rifle, grog's axe, fire axe, power fist, double barrel, combat shotty, minigun, hundred or so grenades, mines, and a couple other odds and ends. Most are some form of legendary, generally on the low end though. RNG please stop making all my three star weapons trash.
---
I most am restricted to power armor, due to carry weight from calibrated shocks, or excavator base set bonus, I do have a very nice set of regular armor, I just don't wear it right now because when I step out of my power armor it's to blow some poor fool away with my beserkers explosive dragon. I got like 6 different epic 3 star right legs, but absolute garbage left leg options. I also have access to complete marine armor via crafting, complete with most of the mods, the hardened(?) undersuit, and the helmet.

Figure that one out, I still am not sure I have, but hey.
---
If they were to renew the engine and use better optimization i would play it, but playing an unfinished and glitchy game at &lt;45 fps is no fun for me 
---
Lol yeah, you have to sort of cover your ass with prefaces like that if you don’t want downvotes, and about the post-launch thing they might’ve put some effort into them but ultimately the same bugs stayed unless you downloaded mods to fix it. Either way it is cool that they’re fixing it now but they obliterated consumer trust in the process
---
Youre shitting me
---
A couple more bugs thats ruining my game experience lately: 
---
* Power armor or +1000 hazmat suite not working on most nuke zones and I get extreme amounts of rad damage (need to consume 1 rad away every minute). Then sometimes magically same gear doesn't receive mad rad damage on nuke zones. No broken parts, nothing. Just inconsistent. Sometimes the game doesn't recognize that you are wearing a PA or a hazmat suit. 
---
* Some of my close range shots doesn't damage enemies. I can see the blood and the hit sound but their health bars don't move. 
---
* I get an error message and drop out of the server every 10 to 20 minutes or so. 
---
* Enemy bodies disappearing seconds after I kill them. Prevents me from looting. 
---
* Inconsistent weapon damage, my 400 damage legendary gause rifle that shoots double projectile almost got me killed! A 70 damage none modded stock  combat rifle was way more effective clearing out level 68 mutant hoard. If I didnt switched to cobat rifle I would be dead. A 70 damage rifle is more affective then a 400 damage rifle. Weapon damages just doesnt make sense.  ------- My baseball bat, sometimes kill glowing Level 68 scorchers on golf course nuke zones with one shot (I just walk in there one shotting everything), then on other times when I get into the same area nuke zone with the same level/type enemies, it takes up to 7 hits to kill them. Same perks, same weapon, same weapon damage, same level enemies, just not consistent weapon damage. Its not the same weapon feel anymore, almost like the weapon is downgraded by itself dramatically. Only to get back its power next time I enter into the nuke zone. 
---
* When one gun breaks, you loose both of your guns. Meaning automatically you un equipe all your guns so there is nothing to switch to. You are left with bare hands and you need to run until you can find a safe space to equipe your second gun again from your inventory. Fast switch button doesnt work. 
---
Level 1 mole rats = 1 wave
---
Level 68 super mutant, gulper, radtoad, Mt. Gutsy's = 3 waves.
---
Good luck, Hoomahn.
---
Thanks man I’ll have to try and farm a load later on! 
---
They make it worse each patch but don't mention it, they must think we're stupid...
---
Scorchbeast are included in the bonus tho. And dive nothing other than scorchbeast or certain animals can take hits, its a pretty sweet bonus
---
Think about it, negative publicity. Gamers who have yet to purchase fallout 76, hear bad things. Before you know it, they will be hearing how everything is complete and it’s a whole new game. The “fallout 76 bounces back” posts might drive a new influx of gamers. Risky move I’d say.
---
And Destiny: The Taken King lol 
---
I've had him spawn (once) as soon as I loaded in at the station.. I didn't even have to run over the bridge. no other players around anywhere, but he popped into existence right in front of my face.
---
It won’t be any big/game changing DLC. It’ll just be updates to the game. They said they are going to use the vaults to add new characters, quests and items etc in the near future. 
---
I put “welcome” in small letters on the wall next to the front door. I got the small letter plans randomly when claiming a workshop
---
That's what my .50 cal is for.
---
I see. Thanks then. Also post it in top level for max visibility. 
---
This is the first fallout game I've ever played, and I usually play it solo, everything jumping at me from the shadows makes me jump, lol.
---
Did you like fallout 4? would you enjoy exploring the wastes with a friend? Just like the lore of the fallout series and don't mind reading it off a terminal/listening to a holotape? this might be the game for you. its the same aimless looting/fighting as FO4, with the added element of multiplayer, minus having physically present NPC's giving you the quests. The patches that have come out since launch have increased stability some, but there are still some issues as well. I think the game is going in a positive direction and they are committed to supporting it.
---
It is sir!
---
Certainly didn't work for no man's sky...
---
They gave use enoght
---
I was. It was because the silo was already used in the server before it’s time reset
---
Exactly this. It doesn't matter in any single player game unless you profit, but even the possibility of effecting someone else is large beans.
---
You're right. This is their game and they have the right to do whatever they want. I may disagree with their position and call it erroneous, but this is just my opinion. And if the community believes that a well-known, old company that sells its games for real money may behave this way - it’s not for me to judge for everyone. It just seems to me that this is not a decent behavior.
---
Put yourself in my place. You love company, you love their games, you buy their games for many years, and then you are banned. For the fact that previously did not cause any questions.
---
More like now that you know how to boil water and cook a steak and we showed you the importance of fetching shit for us now we're going to put a fire suit on you and send you into the pit of Hell itself so good luck and thanks for volunteering! 
---
Sure they aren't obliged but if their policy is to have recurring customers then they will. I can't say Bethesda is going above and beyond though. There are some easy to fix issues lingering in the game since beta that have taken them weeks or months to address. I don't feel they are making substantial progress but hey, at least they are dedicated to continue at their own pace.
---
Well, my anecdotal experience is that the rate of disconnects is the same but after many weeks of only disconnects I also got a crash. Or to be more specific a freeze followed by a crash. Before this I've experienced only two crashes and both were in the first week after release.
---
In my opinion, I too enjoy FO76, not as much on my own as much as with my buddy, but that's a personal thing. However, if I *think* about it as multiplayer Fallout, I don't think it's that good. If I think about it like a survival game, it's awesome. You need to worry about hunger, thirst, disease, rads. I really loved in FNV, and I found I tried to add a lot of that to FO4 to get it to where I would enjoy for longer, and with FO76, I find myself not really looking for ways I would change the game as much. But all in all, I'm happy with it.
---
Another difference is that SoT was buttery smooth and stable at launch.
---
anyone willing to explain mutatins fast and simple?
---
Don't bulk.  The stash limit is weight and bulk weighs more than unbulked.
---
[PSA: Only lead and aluminum can be bulked to save weight](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a1xzba/psa_only_lead_and_aluminum_can_be_bulked_to_save/)
---
(And the bulk acid bug has been fixed in the latest patch).
---
Im gonna have to say that weapon is complete garbage and you need to trade it to me, at 6:30pm EST tonight. it is such an abomination it needs to be destroyed and only I know how to scrap legendary's!
---
This is all sarcastic, it is actually a beautiful weapon I am very jealous of. 
---
Yeh man, having it take such a long g time to put a certain build together, it would be nice to test it against friends. Even when someone drops that nice item and having friendly wagers over who wins. I used to to it often in warcraft, and I know that's a very different game, but it would still translate well. Let's hope someone important reads your post. :)
---
'Hey guys so this guy killed me and then I went back to where he was and he killed me again, then I did the same thing again and he killed me again. then I did the same thing a load of times and now I have no caps. Why is this allowed?'
---
You just...oh my god kid. No offense but are you dumb? You need evidence yet you know how to dupe, because you know whether or not the glitch worked. You don't need evidence, you know how it works. Fuck wits, man.
---
Cant wait to see you when you realize theres no endgame
---
Agreed ♥️👍
---
Fusion cores are not an issue. Even with their spawn rates in the wild reduced in the last patch, once you know where to find cores you can more-or-less break even on them while using a Gatling Laser as your main weapon, even without using any of the (recently fixed) core processors at the three power plants.
---
If you don't use VATS or melee and you take the Full Charge perk to remove the sprint penalty, one fusion core will last you a *long* time.
---
This is my main gripe after playing last night. Getting in and out of power armor sucks so bad now.
---
Correct. I made it probably 2/3 the way of launching, then had to quit. I returned the next time and I had to start over.
---
I've been sucking down overdrive as a HW build and I have never been addicted. I have 1 point in chem resistant, planning on going 100% resistant just in case,  but prior to slotting it: never. 
---
I've only read about people being addicted to alcohol and that is a -2 Str and -2 Cha penalty.
---
Wouldn’t it make more sense for this suggestion to be just plans? 
---
Yeah, I pop various mentats and x-cell and such before salvaging weapons and armor in the hopes of learning more mods or recipes and I’ve never gotten addicted to anything. I’ve been carrying a single addictol in my inventory from day one, just in case... I can probably just sell that at this point.
---
You get black titanium from the ash heap area, mostly from the mole miners. Fusion cores are easy to find if you play normally and explore, they can be gotten from random power armor or the fusion reactors.
---
If you really are having trouble finding fusion cores, then you can get the plans to build your own fusion core machine from a random plan dropped doing the power plant events.
---
Bethesda deleted items from my workshop countless times, items that in most cases required hours of grinding to find plans for and then hours more to find materials to build them with. 
---
Why would I have sympathy for anyone who loses items that were created through dishonest practices that ruin the game for others?   
---
I'd like to know this as well. Are the powered doors two shot explosive? I'm not interested in using them as projectiles if not
---
Natural wood, right?  So nice!  The value of my CAMP went way up after I installed it.
---
Also zero, also use drugs constantly across three characters.
---
However, I'm on PC and I could *swear* I saw my girlfriend get Psycho addiction on PS4. 
---
seems like what i've been doing - watching twitch streams, working, emailing - and hopping this vendor.  doing distant thunder or it's a trap, and the occasional SBQ if I hop into one.  Yea ... not sure what i'm guna do once I find it :)
---
get rad go fast
---
That's kind of what the Enclave is supposed to be.  It would be fitting (but probably alienate a lot of players) if Enclave equipment, quests, and vendors were not usable by mutated characters.
---
but it takes perk bonuses from energy right?
---
Cool. Not found them yet.
---
Same when it comes to things like animations and the like but not with regards to weapon balance. 
---
Remember that most of the content that will be released is already almost done and the skeleton crew that runs the studio now is just releasing with tweak patches as time goes on, that's, again, the goal of the business model. Hence why splitting servers wouldnt be wise for them until most content is out, it would stress the skeleton crew too much and they'd be spread thin for making other patches.
---
I got one by drinking all of the booze I had on me at one time. The addiction isn't listed in any way in the menus at least for alchohol. It just passively lowers stats and doesn't tell you other than you are know addicted to booze
---
Yeah i play with around 12+ people and we usually over take the servers when we are on. We would love to be able to make a small town/city. Please make this possible!
---
Cunty reply man, cant bash people for having higher expectations for a company that has produced things like fo3 and nv
---
So glad to see others saying this. Just reread the patch notes and I don't see any direct mention of thirst.
---
They're extremely fiddley.
---
The through walls connectors end up on the roof. The radiators go under the floor. The tall power armor station won't go underneath them.....
---
But keep trying and good luck.
---
&gt;they thought they could release an unfinished and buggy game like they always do and people would just accept it like they always do
---
This is something that needs to die. We shouldn't be accepting non finished games. We shouldnt even be holding the notion of that idea. I wouldn't accept a meal that's not finished cooking, I wouldn't buy a new car that's missing parts on day one. Why the fuck should a company this large be content releasing a half baked game only for the modding community to fix in unofficial patches?

Thank you. This was very helpful. I went back through my history in depth and there was one instance where I referenced my discord from a few weeks back. It’s been fixed. Much appreciated!
---
Here's to hoping everybody who had anything to do with those dupe glitches gets banned for life.
---
Including people who knowingly bought duped weapons.
---
My buddy has tried to launch a nuke three different times and the server crashes at some point all three times 😂
---
I think this is a great idea. The mutations are great but for people that don't want or need them this could be really cool to have some bonus for it. 
---
They probably should have, but they also wouldn’t have had a major release for the holiday season if they didn’t. I’m guessing that decision came from a corporate suit rather than the actual developers.
---
There’s a few right next to the lake point where Swarm of Suitors is
---
Rifles actually. I dont know that there are any energy damage perks
---
It is pretty uncommon.  Honestly it is a pretty good rate.  Not nearly enough to make usage a pain but addiction happens.  Definitely a "not even mad" when one does pop.
---
HURHURHURHURHYUR
---
Nice idea. It's quite funny when game developers do something like that. I remember a couple years back Rockstar did just this on gta. Some players glitched a car into online that shouldn't have been there. Rather than simply removing glitched cars, they made it so whenever someone tried to drive it out their garage the thing just exploded and killed them. Genius.
---
I'm guessing something similar could be done with these duped weapons. 
---
Has anyone tried seeing if it's linked with fast travel?
---
I’ve dropped so many two shots but *never* even a single explosive :(
---
Ya he is a duper
---
There are different variations of the same design of certain suits.
---
Yeah. I agree. One thing that really got me was brotherhood questline. I sometimes go through glasses caverns just to see their very last stand. That cave has so many enemy corpses, and they're tough enemies too, not just some rats. Brotherhood of Steel really stood tall and delivered death and carnage those motherfuckers before eventually falling to enemies extreme numbers but damn. That place. 
---
they SHOULD have waited.....
---
WTH is this part? "even without using any of the (recently fixed) core processors at the three power plants."
---
so i just need to keep running around and look for cores anyway :P
---
Finish the Miner Miracle quest.
---
I always thought that your thirst increases the more you sprint (drain AP). I'm not affected too much by this thirst sinkhole as I also have dozens of bottles of purified water and Dromedary Rank 3 in the pocket
---
...........
---
I would beg to differ. When no mans sky updated everything it jumped to number 34th in global sales on steam. I don’t think Hello games was aiming for the bounce though.
---
well, i have heard form a good source that they are going to turn those without a TSE an constantly complaining into "rad rats" with a painted target on the back :)
---
It’s so nice to see positive stuff about this game lol 
---
I know, i just don't need/use that perk. I use the perk that reduces fast travelling costs by 30%. My strength, endurance, intelligence, and luck are all fairly high up
---
It's pretty great as a solo/occasional coop game, if you can live without NPCs.  
---
Obviously this is duped because no one can find the explosive legendary prefix in the game. &lt;--Everyone on this sub
---
I pre-ordered. I played through BETA.
---
Perhaps I am one of the luck ones. I have not experienced the game that others have. I do not disconnect all the time. I have not experienced game breaking bugs. 
---
I go to Whitesprings for Nukes. I go kill the ScorchBeast Queen. I kill Scorchbeast. I do not server hop for plans, mods or spawns. All good things ... and all that. 
---
I do not know you and you do not know me. I have no idea what you based your assessment on or how you determine such things and vice-versa. 
---
I can say the game is what you make of it and with all of the negativity it can skew many people before they even hit play. 
---
Some power through like any other online game for the uber loot. Some explore, take their time and read terminals, notes and listen to holotapes. 
---
So - No I guess I do not feel that way, but that is okay and I am still looking forward to this journey and the adventure of where it will lead.
---
As far as i could tell, one dense mod on a chest was enough.  I didn't buy a duped TSE though.. just a combat rifle with exploding.
---
Keep amazing ones. Sell or give away or drop the others depending on value and how encumbered I am. 
---
So they sell far fewer units at full price because the game gets terrible reviews for being a broken mess and then sell a bit more at sale prices once they patch it a bit?  Seems like a bad business decision.  Although by the looks of it they want to scam people with the atom store.  $10 for a mediocre skin...
---
this! i started as a sneak sniper...realized the massive benefit of melee over rifles without TSE.....then got an explosive rifle and its comparable to melee...so right now i'm somewhere in between the two. cant WAIT for the legendary hunting rifles finally though
---
Excellent, that's gonna be awesome!
---
When you installed windows, the program files typically default to c or boot partition. You can edit the .ini files or short cut to point to where it’s currently installed.
---
I woulda backed up the program install files first reinstall windows.
---
Good luck.
---
thanks i guess i will keep an eye for "power plant event" just in case. havent seen any so far but sure why not :P
---
People who cheat in online games get banned. End of story.
---
I suppose someone found out I'm a jerk IRL, lol.  Who knows.
---
Yeah, I had a Chem addition and didn't realize it until I saw that I always was -1 to STR. Still looking to kick the habit, but I can't find the drug to make me not want to take drugs anymore :'( My life is so Ironic!
---
There's a MOD for that? How do I get it and how do you install MODS in Fo76?
---
And springs. 80 of the bloody things just for the level 35 Excavator PA legs!
---
High agility (19) level plus not wearing armor gives you better sneaking stats.
---
138, IIRC
---
"You missed the point.. You were the one saying you'd outrun me while I was over encumbered."
---
I stand by my statement, and if you are on xbox I would gladly challenge you to a snail race from one end of the map to the other, vault 76 door to site prime, and will put up 200 ballistic fiber. Money, mouth,..., profit? LOLs.
---
so pa frames, raider, excavator, 45, ,51, 60, x1, ultracite, hybrid, I count 8.
---
I have to ask... 
---
What do you do on the game? I'm only level 57 and feel like there's nothing worth doing now. I usually just end up running circles around my CAMP, since there aren't any quests for me to do.
---
It's not only that they didn't try until then but also just that like, they aren't children. We aren't giving them participation ribbons. They were given real money. Trying and failing isn't usually a thing we reward companies for.
---
I don't think the game is the disaster some people claim but it can be a real mess. So I am not sure the OP's statement that they are trying is really any counter to the criticisms. 
---
Scorchbeasts and the queen are not included... 
---
Beyond Marsupial they are all kind of questionable unless you have Class freak.  If you have Class Freak at 3, then pretty  much every mutation is good.
---
They duped it obviously...
---
This made me lol
---
It's precisely because I am NOT new to open world console multiplayer that I am upset.  Halo, L4D, Borderlands, Mass Effect Multiplayer, Destiny 1, Destiny 2...
---
Yes, all of them did post-release tweaks, but NONE of these games ever crashed out to the dashboard on me and my friends.  None of these games DC'ed multiple times an hour, which is an all-too common occurrence.  None of these games had framerate and  graphics issues anywhere near on par with FO76.  
---
RemindMe! at 6pm
---
Camp McClintock or however you spell it can give 13-17 springs per visist... gotta love clipboards.
---
Also look into getting the perks to lessen repairs for repairing all types of armor.  I use one ballistic fiber per piece repairing my level 50 leather.
---
I agree. I don’t give a shit about dying anymore. I rarely have high value junk. 
---
Gooifying (is that a word?) A body has a good chance of nag it unlootable. Don't know if this is what you're talking about, but most of the time, those green piles with contain loot
---
Well ya with the +vats accuracy it should make a big difference 
---
Why does the imgur album have a screenshot from ESO’s team, then?
---
Have we considered that they might not ever actually fix these, as they compete with their micro-transactions?
---

---
Sweet! Absolutely awesome news!
---
Keep the ban Hammer pounding.
---
Anyone who duped and anyone who knowingly bought a duped item should be banned for life.
---
Duper.
---
Got an instigating one 
---
Oh dear, I'm so sorry. I honestly didn't want to do that at all so I thought about just deleting a few hundred a day because I was tired of being unable to build anything. Eventually I thought about using a macro, then went and found one which I used in the background while watching videos in the background. Even with a macro set up to delete about 2-3 items a second it took about half an hour. 
---
I'm still not entirely sure what causes the bug because I haven't had it occur after the update which lets you server hop to keep your camp if the location is taken and since then I've largely stayed in the same spot as of late.
---
Mine was not duped either. Got it as a drop from non stop whitesprings farm before they started to nerf it. My gf has a exploding handmade, and dense doesnt seem to be enough after her commando perks, demolition perk and bloody mess. 
---
I mean she can survive a shot or two, but the third does her in.  With fireproof 3 she takes zero damage from that sneaky mob that melee combats her out of the blue that she has to point blank kill
---
During beta I drank alchohol exclusively to satisfy thirst. During one session I binged (five bottles in rapid succession) and got hit with addiction.
---
Question.. how do you even tell if a weapon someone's using is a two-shot or not?
---
That's actually legit really fucking good and possibly one of the best trifectas you can get on it. In fact having two-shot on it would make it WORSE (I've covered this in previous comments, accuracy goes to shit with two shot long-range weapons).
---
You get +30% scorched dmg which is more or less your end-game #1 enemy.
---
You get explosive which does the most splash damage and can clear out packs (great for a sniper who relies on slow firing heavy hitting rifles), imagine this is the BOZAR with explosive rounds from NV.
---
You also get +250 dmg resisstance when the sniper is most vulnerable, i.e. when he is reloading.
---
It really can't be better than this.
---
Maybe Instigating + explosive will be slightly better damage wise, but I would buy this in a heartbeat and put a hardened .50 receiver.
---
Typical. Personal attacks. 
---
You're misinterpreting on purpose. What is intended to say is that if you rob an unlocked house you're a criminal, and if you  exploit a game that wasnt built to be exploited you're a criminal too.
---
By using robbery to explain game exploitation is by association making the comparison. 
---
Furthermore, if you get robbed its your fault you didnt lock the house.
---
You dont want your house robbed? Lock it.
---
The same as its Bethesdas fault not having the game fixed.
---
Its not rocket science. You dont want people to exploit your game. Good. Before releasing it, make sure they cant explot it.
---
But of course, its better to release an exploitable game and make money out of it. Then blame gamers for exploiting your incompetence. Im blaming the community for tolerating these practices. 
---
Before they do this they need to create some sort of void storage or off character storage. This "Solution" will hurt people who dupe yes, however it will also hurt the people who are using low level characters as mules. 
---
Please let me explain before you downvote, I dunno how many hours you guys put in so far but I play at least 6-8 hours a day and have almost 350+ hours in the game. The community that I am a part of and we need to be able to mule extra drops because the community is constantly growing, we enjoy farming up extra gear and giving it to the new recruits who join. So realistically I am asking for these limits not to be implemented. Not because of my own selfish wants but due to the fact that it will hurt growing communities who enjoy helping out the new players such as the one I am part of.
---
Can you show Pic as proof? Do far there hasn't been a single 4 star, except with an added scorch killer mod 
---
I wonder if we need to be careful on this request and it is a glitch that the weight of the attached power armor goes away
---
I would love to have a spiral staircase of some sort. 
---
Maybe I can tweak my settings with it, but this only happens with 76. All my other games run fine online. 
---
You're right about that one specific piece out of thousands
---
It's like pointing out a freckle and declaring the person that has it is ugly because of it
---
I think people who are constantly over-encumbered are just used to it now and are adjusting there game play for it. Although I'd love more stash size so i could store more of my junk, I'll probably be always over encumbered because i like to carry 2 suites of standard armor, a suite of power armor and a few different weapons.
---
Over-encumbered is the hardcode mode in Fallout 76. I can only imagine what it's like to fight mobs with no risk of loss, must be magical. Oh to run and fast travel like the unencumbered, must make Rose's and Abbie's quests take like 10 minutes rather then real time. 
---
Sure it’s the devs job to build, create, fix, improve but I blame Bethesda management for rushing the game out. I love FO76 even with all its faults and I agree it still feels like a beta. But it’s fun to be involved with it nonetheless. And, having been in situations where time is off the essence and management is breathing down your neck, I know how hard it is. 
---
I’d love for Bethesda to have waited longer to release the game, but now that we’re here I’m glad to see how responsive they are to feedback. 
---
I think speed demon wasn't working correctly maybe? And people are noticing it now
---
Pretty much any game ever will ban you for abusing exploits.
---
If you could duplicate money in wow I am 100% sure you would be banned from wow if you did it.
---
I’m enjoying the game, and I think a lot of the reason why is because I haven’t played it as much as I would like to. I played the crap out of fallout 4. I look forward to every patch. Day 1 the game was terrible. I think this being an online game there is a chance they can add lots of new content along with Patches. I’m level 48 right now and my only question is what is there to do end game? When is end game? 
---
4 all in the same session, 1 tse double barrel, 1 quad explosive pump, 1 furious .50 cal explosive and 1 double and explosive smg 
---
I don’t think you can have both, pacifist pets that aggro on camp griefers.
---
I think it’s 1 or the other.
---
Pretty sure people with split personalities goto mental institutions, not jail
---
"it just works"
---
You can post videos privately and they can be opened only by knowing the links -every YouTuber knows it, and knows that it's the proper way to post an exploit if you just want to show it to the developers. If they made a public video showing an exploit, they know they are going to spread it and don't give a crap about BGS fixing it.
---
Honestly! I fucking love this!
---
I had a defense event at the munitions factory for scorchbeasts. For some reason, both of them just dupped around Sunnytop for a solid 10 minutes before they headed up to bother me.
---
I wish people would stop praising support like the dev is doing us a favor. Fuck that. I bought your AAA title. It is expected and required you support it. 
---
Because a bug exists does not mean it's fair game to exploit it. 
---
"Everyone is already dead"  
---
Not true, we still have several other vaults that will be opening soon, as well as our fellow vault dwellers from 76.  
---
"Everything is scorched"  
---
I'll give you this one, because the plague has spread across such a wide area  
---
"isn't a real questline"  
---
We aren't talking about quest line's, we're talking about things that we've accomplished  
---
"dropping a nuke on a site spawns exponentially more scorched"  
---
That's kind of the point? The source of the plague are the scorch beasts. The scorch beast queen gives birth to the scorch beasts at an alarming rate. we drop a nuke on prime to draw her out, and we kill her. Thus, ending the plague
---
Good. Because if they introduce future content with the ability for C.A.M.P. player vending, without widespread bans on exploiters and duppers, i will officially be D.O.N.E.   
---
I can tolerate (to a degree) many of the games issues, but if they essentially reward cheaters then fuck Bethesda.  It's bad enough that assholes are making real life money off these exploits but I just could never support Bethesda for their continue lack of respect towards their consumers. 
---
Well if this is Vanilla Naxx, most people didn't even step into the instance. 
---
But new-school Naxx, just get out of the green goo and you're fine. 
---
Yeah.. he might want to crouch for hidden, vats target head.. probably would have been a 1-shot
---
&gt;  but not with regards to weapon balance.
---
Citation needed. Seriously, anything which is a PvP problem is ALSO a PvE Problem.
---
Even if you're a melee build, remember that you get a 2x damage bonus from stealth, and it can be tough to sneak up on things from a distance in power armor. So, use a long range weapon like a hunting or lever action rifle, then tap the left directional to switch to melee as it gets close. You can also chuck a grenade or two, or use a rocket launcher or fat man, since you'll be in an open, outside area. They don't do as much damage as previous games, but still cripple limbs well. 
---
It'll be a strange world after, I know this for sure as I walk a free man today ahahah!
---
I guess based on the fact that I had zero desktop crashes before the last patch and a lot of server disconnects. You know, 100 hrs or so of it.  Not speculation you twat.
---
I can tell the difference now. It is kind of darker ... I guess.
---
One word, good. 
---
the ones that point down will want to go through the floor above if they are on a 1 wall through wall connector raise these with half walls or use the floor based ones to correct this (as these are intended from going from above a floor/roof down)
---
the opposite applies to the ones that point up
---
for the through side walls connector you have to select to connect the cable from inside or from the connector you want to connect it to, to make it connect properly
---
hope that helps
---
THIS IS GOLD, thanks so much!
---
The key word is "can".
---
It appears to be a popular location and I only find the clipboards once every 3-5 relogs.
---
But when I do find them just stacked in those blue plastic boxes boy do I get an orgasm of joy!
---
Will check on the perks, I had no idea they counted towards PA as well, the only thing I've got on that side is the one that allows you to repair and craft it at 130% condition.
---
Pacifist mode should be more readily explained in game 
---
While creating your character it should explain it, and tell you to open the menu and turn it on.
---
I wouldn't go that far, but I do not miss NPCs at all. If anything, I wish I could actually play it totally alone with no other players on the map. They really need to create an offline mode. I do quite enjoy my "last person on Earth" play experience, and I almost feel disappointed when I see other players. I do like the friendly interactions like the occasional thumbs up or jamming on some instruments together, but I would not miss those if they were gone. I feel like the griefing has increased quite a bit since the first few weeks, sadly. 
---
Yes its a game. Thats what im saying. And people are associating game exploits to crime. Which imo wrong.
---
what's a mob-flamer?
---
I agree with you which is why I posted my situation.
---
I love the game and we’ve had a blast playing it, when it worked.
---
As an online game they really need to step up and take care of stuff NOW.
---
Look at GTA online, it’s had its share of problems and still does. I played it when I first came out years ago and it wasn’t anything special. They fixed issues and now they have a a game that still shows up on best selling lists years after release.
---
I want fallout 76 to succeed and be the great game that I know it can be but as it stands now I doubt if it will have the player base left to warrant them spending a lot to support and fix what needs fixing.
---
It would be easy to fix the majority of duped weapons, any weapon that is stacked over 10 in one inventory slot, or 10 identical weapons in one players inventory (legendary weapons only) gets replaced. I'm sure that's simple code compared to what they did to make the game.
---
This secret will astound you!
---
\*Buys Wind Instrument**s**\* *Gets only a tuba* "WHY TODD WHY!" 
---
The three Power Plants each have a Fusion Core Processor, which creates 100% charged Fusion Cores. A previous patch erroneously set the processor's production rate at 0.8 per hour. The most recent patch (on PC) puts it back up at 8 per hour, which is more than enough for all but the heaviest core users (e.g. VATS-based Gatling Laser users who don't believe in the Power User perk).
---
If you know where to pick up Fusion cores elsewhere and cut unnecessary power losses, you don't even need the power plants in order to maintain your stock of cores.
---
I use chems frequently, pretty often. Only gotten one addiction in my play through.
---
I'm almost certain is Speed Demon.
---
Not expecting anything. Not speaking to you. I just want a refund if you can't help, move along.
---
Lol wtf
---
&gt; That's kind of the point? The source of the plague are the scorch beasts. The scorch beast queen gives birth to the scorch beasts at an alarming rate. we drop a nuke on prime to draw her out, and we kill her. Thus, ending the plague
---
And I can drop another nuke in the same spot 20 minutes later and kill her again, and again, and again. The scorch come out more from the nukes, and the scorched in the area dont die or stop from killing the queen
---
That sounds credible to me.  It's sounding like maybe the dense armor mod and fireproof are calculating additively?  Fireproof is what, 45% at rank 3?  Sucks I only have 1 point in END so I can't go see for myself =/
---
Where did this drop for you?
---
Look at the left side of that image. I first built a 1st floor base and then adjust the direction to build a ladder than put 2nd floor on to the bridge.
---
I finally completed it 😭👌
---
So juice head?
---
Indubitably, my dear boy, indubitably.
---
It’s only a theory. And I don’t mean after the patches. I mean after a few months when the games gets all the bugs fixed. 
---
Once it’s fixed I’m sure gaming blogs and streamers will make a big deal about all the positive changes. Then fans and new player could join back in with a new light. 
---
I see it as an anchoring bias. The bar was set low with the initial release. Now with small patches, continual change, and the image that they are listening to the fans, anything is better than where they started. 
---
Don’t get me wrong. I’ve loved the game from its release. And I don’t agree with the micro transaction in the atom shop. 
---
&gt;&gt;Incorrect. I mocked people who shoot themselves in the foot, then get upset when people suggest they don't shoot themselves in the foot
---
&gt; Your first comment generalized everybody who wants mores stash as having poor impulse control
---
Yes, because the people who have no self control are precisely the people who want unlimited stash, because they're basically 10
---
That's some NIMBYism right there :)
---
I agree mate. For a multplayer game its awesome as an solo player.
---
It's sad that you're able to find your way to Reddit but are unable to grasp a very simple comparison.  
---
Even sadder is the fact that you think an unlocked house that gets robbed is the fault of the house owner instead of the robber.  
---
Good thing both robbing houses and exploiting Fallout 76 are not allowed if you get caught there are consequences.
---
I believe I’m sitting around 400 on both. I have an unyielding gear set so those numbers aren’t as optimized as if I had my vanguard set on, but I do have scaly skin and grounded with strange in numbers almost always in effect. I’ll experiment with it later today to see how those stats affect it.
---
Its actually more than likely from fixing a mutation (speed demon), but by all means keep the tin foil hat on.
---
I've definitely found something about vaults and such on the net, but no official statement. Vaults seem to be group based endgame content, where once it starts nobody can go in and out till it's over.
---
This was a mod in fallout 4 .. I would love to see this in the game.  I know it promotes something quite bad for the youngsters and oldsters alike, but, we are already murdering poor megasloths for no good reason.
---
Whether it's through bethesda or mastercard I bet it will.
---
ScorchBeast Queen (SBQ) is end game thus far.i love the game but the “end” is lackluster at best imo.
---
Can anyone confirm or deny if Scorched effect works on Scorched Beasts or just the humanoids??
---
No program is perfect. Exploiters are explicitly looking to bend or break the code in unintended ways for gain.
---
Stop trying to rationalise this.
---
That was my thought. However, I hope that they are going to get rid of those players before player in game vending comes along. 
---
I have a feeling they will try. The won't get all, but enough I hope. 
---
There's alot of detail, and awesome hidden things to find and do. The game isn't always about farming legendaries and caps. You have to explore and use those legendaries too.
---
Right, but no man's sky was a brand new IP from a studio that has only released small indie games. Where as Bethesda is a triple A game developer who has  three separate studios, who released a game that is related to a beloved franchise. Before the game even released they had turned away a large portion of their fan base by announcing that there would be no npc's. If they were banking on some sort "bounce back", I think they may have gone about it all wrong.

Adictol is pretty rare. Good luck!

Main questline isn't the overseer's logs.  That's why its a sidequest.

Wow...how did I miss that...HOLY CRAP!

If the list was a top 10 'disappointing' games of the year then he is fully allowed to have fo76 at the top. There was a lot of hype around the game, its made by Bethesda and its one of the most loved franchises in gaming. It was one of the biggest disappointments of the year when it came out as a buggy unfinished mess
---
I don't have any sources for what I'm going to say, but it does seem to make sense and I've heard modders say this, but it could be totally wrong so keep that in mind. Also, please correct me if I get anything wrong.
---
Apparently the Creation Engine or whatever it is called counts each item individually. Instead of saying something like .308 round (x10) it lists 10 .308 rounds. This is why duping is a big problem. When you have someone walking around with 20000 nuka colas it lists 20000, not Nuka Cola (x20000.) It makes sense as I can't imagine Bethesda (actually, I kinda would now) would really cheap out on their servers. With their system it requires thousands of times more power (not supported by fact, but I'm gonna guess it does since it counts them individually instead of as one) than how most other video games do it (I believe.) I don't believe Bethesda said specifically that dupers harm the server stability, but if what I've heard (and put in this comment) is true, then it most definitely does.
---
Every level starting at 51 will allow you to realocate 1 Special point of your chosing. You can change your perk cards around at any time during your progression.
---
I don't see why it is taking so long. I mean how hard would it be to run a query on player inventories for anyone with 10000+ of a single line item. I have seen images of people with literally millions of items in their inventories. Database query, find the culprits and widespread ban. Like yesterday. 
---
Just one star sadly. And it's berserkers
---
I was happy to see we got more than just Harpersferry, I feel right at home walking through there. I was shocked when I stumbled across Berkeley Springs, had no idea they had been included!
---
&gt; If you really are having trouble finding fusion cores, then you can get the plans to build your own fusion core machine from a random plan dropped doing the power plant events.
---
Fusion generators aren't the same as Fusion Core Processors. The generators (which are the things you build in your CAMP) are generators that provide 100 power to your CAMP or Workshop. The Core Processors are fixed resource generators found at the power plant workshops, and produce 8 cores per hour at a cost of 100 power.
---
Unless they add an additional effect I don't see how they would. It's base SMG damage + legendary effect.
---
I've played for over 200 hours using psychobuff/tats and alch often and the only time I got an addiction was when I accidentally used a med-x by accident and I've never had chem resistant on (though you may want to ask someone who runs a junkie build to tell you how often you can get addicted)
---
Oh that's interesting. Is this a mutation thing? What's getting your AGI that high if not armor buffs?
---
I have armor with sneak benefits to the point most enemies walk right up to me without hitting danger, but scorchbeasts will still spot me.
---
I feel a bit bad about rejecting the team-up requests... but the feeling goes away quickly. :)
---
I guess. Idk I've never made a game before so i don't know how it works and google only gives you general knowledge. Which is why i won't judge. 
---
They seem to be random. I’ve happened across them twice in wildly different sections of the map. I think they are like Graham in the sense that he could be anywhere. 
---
FINALLY! Been selling all my grenades because of this issue, guess I can finally start using them again :)
---
How the fuck do you get that damage out of a rifle. I have all the rifleman quirks, bloody mess etc and I think my level 50 rifles cap at 168 or some shit. Is it part of the explosive perk?
---
I haven't played or read the lore in such a long time :P
---
Deamonhunters (Grey Knights) were my main army, but I do have Imperial Guard, Space Wolves, Black Templar, and Tau armies :P
---
Those terms of service can be a real bitch, eh?
---
I always thought it was the mutants there I had to kill, so I guess I've never actually been able to compete that event. 
---
Thank you.
---
I'm happy to group with you. Gamertag "PRIMUS 112358". 
---
FYI you can use a Stealth Boy to sneak past the boss at the end. 
---
Good. 
---
Anyone worth watching has already played the game, launched a nuke, killed the queen and moved on.
---
I've seen PS4 users in particular post about constant crashes (besides server disconnects).
---
I haven't seen any solution to it and its probably core issues with the game that cause it.
---
Read my first comment again
---
I just play with some people I met on here and we have fun just doing random stuff 
---
Everything after my first sentence was responding.
---
I had gone into "I'm overloaded and I don't care, let's loot everything!" mode Sunday and I decided to rebuild my camp that evening because I had over 7000 wood (and similar steel, etc) in my inventory. Legit. I also made multiple modded boards of every level less than 30 and scattered them around 76 and Flatwoods and server hopped a few times to distribute them as well. I think I got a full level from crafting.
---
Now if they have &gt; 1 identical TSE or whatever weapon, lock the account and let the appeals department sort it out. (If they bought 2-5 instead of duping them, they were still part of the problem imho)
---
I get invited to events on other sides of the map all the time. Then you get that timer...
---
Kind of an “out there” question, but is bunker buster worth hanging onto? I don’t really use launchers or explosive weapons and the thing weighs 40 lbs, but for some reason I can’t get myself to part with it.
---
I'd rather just see the Scrapper perk give rarer materials, full stop.  Maybe I'm not thinking about it properly, but it certainly doesn't seem like there'd be notable balance or economy differences either way.  And, frankly, farming clipboards for springs is not nearly as entertaining as hunting mobs.  Optimizing a game to allow you to advance by actually playing it, as opposed to mindless farming and time sinks, would seem like the better goal for a game.
---
I can't imagine having a perk give back a screw or spring- or even a strand of ballistic fiber- from something that has those items in their crafting recipe would damage the market or overall game balance.  All told, obtaining a weapon in the field is at least as hard as farming an equivalent material.  I haven't done the statistics to prove it, but it seems pretty likely that an unscrapped piece is going to be notably heaver than its unscrapped equivalent in junk (e.g. a hunting rifle is heavier than a couple of checker boards and a ladle).  Farming weapons for screws, springs, etc. isn't going to happen substantially easier or faster than farming the equivalent resources.
---
Further, even at low charisma and unperked, most weapons and armor pieces are worth more than their equivalent value in scrappable items when sold to vendors.  A combat rifle or piece of leather armor yields a handful of caps, while the equivalent junk (scrapped or unscrapped equal to the scrap value of the weapon/armor) would net less money. Most of the time, you're losing caps if you scrap a weapon vs. selling it.  That gap would somewhat close if you throw in a spring, screw or fiber, but who would be selling those to vendors (outside of desperation and fringe cases)?
---
**TL;DR** \- Just make the current scrapper perk yield rarer materials, if those materials would go into the original crafting of the item.  The game/economy impact would seem to be minimal, in terms of time spent and caps earned/lost, and gathering weapons is considerably more fun than farming junk.
---
Right - there's the intro/scanning portion, the mainframe breakdown and repair portion, then the launch room protect-the-bots portion before you launch, and if you logout you'll log back in outside the silo on a new server.
---
this subreddit is full of white knights who denied truth and want only good news thats why they continue to down vote
---
Big difference between the two. One only impacts you, the other impacts everyone.
---
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤦🏻
---
I have the most downvoted comment ever. Famous af.
---
Then apply the same logic to something more tangible. 'Hey, we made this car out of cardboard but we won't know if it falls apart until someone drives it'.
---
I completely agree. For what they're charging for these things they should cover every single one of them.
---
Lol, the arrogant fanboi has a temper. Move along.
---
i like hitting the steak house every time i log in, lots of fresh veggies, power armour in the garden shed behind the restaurant, and there is recipes that spawn in the kitchen in the basement.
---
plus decent super mutant spawns!
---
There is a way to keep it by relogging and fast traveling
---
Which basically no one will care about for more than a few days. 
---
Forget it. This sub reddit is full of scorched. Run.
---
Maybe one day you will understand.
---
Nuking the fissure site behind the General's Steakhouse turns the whole garden behind the steakhouse into nuked flora....and those are technically domestic and not wild.
---
Go to recent players and try to join game. Worked for me a few times getting back into same server.
---
Yes, it’s pretty much our roles only reversed - you can imagine how shit this is and I just can’t imagine why it’s made this way 
---
I just switch weapons to melee or maybe a flamer. Gatling is good for mid/long and .50cal for mid/short, but they both waste bullets at point blank.
---
I keep my 40% faster swing spiked ski sword on hand. Even without melee perks, it still does great against high level ghouls, bugs, and animals. Anything else that like to get up close but hits hard gets the flamer.
---
right, and MMOs DON'T have different balance for the weapons in PvP and PvE. 
---
If I get on one of the MMOs their weapons don't act wildly differently because I am in an arena. BUT your argument is that they MUST.
---
Don’t kinkshame 
---
I have the same problem on xbox, but with the level 100 achievement.  I'm level 130, no level 100 achievement, it's the only one I haven't completed.
---
whatever triggers the achievements can bug out... maybe it's lag or something.  But, the only answer I've ever been given is... "try on a new character"... sure, just let me grind out 100 more levels... no thanks.
---
It was a pleasant surprise.
---
Yet when I fast travel in Power Armor it still equips my deathclaw gauntlet. It doesn't actually work and do damage (that would be OP AF) but definitely looks out of place.
---
Now we talk about fist weapons in PA. Sorry...
---
This is why I shoot people with the guns I buy.  As a form of protest.  The gun manufacturers shouldn't have allowed me to shoot people I'm not legally allowed to shoot and they're hiding behind disclaimers and the law.
---
I probably won't be able to respond, because I'm going to prison.
---
got addicted to alcohol once, never chems though
---
I am on XB1 
---
Quality input.
---
Same last 5 times I nuked whitesprings. 5-10 people shown up with tse shotguns refusing to share and its lagging like hell and cant loot anything.
---
Explosive perk MASSIVELY inflates the damage listed. 
---
It’s not on console only pc so log on to the Bethesda.net launcher in pc and download them there
---
Do you not think that “most immersive” is pure hyperbole 
---
What temper? You’re mistaking facts with feelings kid. Nice try again. And no, you’re in our house. You invited yourself out. 
---
Permabanning a paying costumer bc they exploited your flaw??????? Are people serious??????? Good god!!! 
---
The cryptos terminal did give the impression that there would be more to it imo. Fingers crossed
---
Played for 6 hours last night, had 5 hard crashes and my teammate had 4, no error just straight desktop. also had the power armour stretch glitch for a bit till she left and re-entered her armour.
---
Two wrongs don't make a right? So wait when you do something wrong, and someone else does something wrong, both people are still wrong?! Enjoy the bans cheaters! 
---
that's a generic game crash code and is due to game stability issues it would be more common when viewing stash or vendor due to the large number of items
---
this should hopefully be fixed with the patch next week also fix for dupes will help this
---
Thanks, on PS4. I'm ok now anyways hunting for food.  Early on I wanted to farm adhesive, but duct tape and wonderglue is common enough that I haven't been adhesive-constrained for a while.
---
You all looking like fools cheering for something that didn't happen.  It would be nice if they took action against those that show they are duping publicly, since we know they can not do anything about the actual players in the game as they do not track characters (as mentioned by their support) or iems (as mentioned by support).   
---
You’d be surprised what you can let go of and not even notice. I keep about 10 each of Rad-X, Rad Away and Stimpacks, 2 addictol and 3-5 disease cure, kind of an emergency first aid kit. 
---
I find enough while out exploring that I haven’t had to dip into it yet. 
---
With ammo, if you aren’t an explosive build, get rid of the missiles and mini nukes. Odds are you’ll never use those thousands of rounds of 10mm and .38 either. Ditch ‘em. 
---
I only store .45, 5.56 and .308, cause that’s all I use. If I decide to use a gun that runs .38, I’ll go take out a few low level scorched hotspots and take their ammo. 
---
Trim the fat and keep moving. 
---
This is much worse when trading with other players. I have two accounts and swap items between them. It used to be easy just to move the slider down to 0 then trade but now it flips over to 24,999 and you can't move it back "up" to 0 so have to drag it down through the whole 24,999....
---
I've had an alcohol addiction, but that was at the beginning of the game when I was having trouble finding purified water.
---
Literally the biggest MMO does exactly this. WoW has separate gear classes for PvP and PvE.
---
I haven’t been able to play because their crappy servers
---
The type of people to only play battle royal games are not the type to play FO76. They're pretty different demographics. Plus, it's not like Bethesda could have known about battle royal games getting so big when they made their schedule, they only got big this year and FO76 has been in development for relatively quite a lot longer.
---
This is the Fallout 4 developer room. They could've reused it in Fallout 76, or this could be Fallout 4 with a mod to add items that look like it's from fallout 76. It would be pretty easy to fake. I'd take it with a grain of salt until we see more evidence. 
---
Classic collection is PC only. You have to download the Bethesda launcher on PC to have access.
---
&gt;Cheating 
---
Lmao I've duped plenty of cars in GTA for money and nothing has ever happened. Everyone seems to think that this would actually work. That Bethesda has a magic "delete all duped items, including things crafted with duped junk and used ammo." Like in what world would this work? 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/actfam/lpt_for_ps4_users/
---
This cut crashes down entirely. Now i only get server disconnects.
---
If your on console it the Dupper doing their emergency stockpiles before the patch.
---
Well that sucks
---
A lot of good stuff in that patch but there's still a lot of stuff yet to get fixed as well.  Don't get me wrong, it's a damn nice step in the right direction but there's still a long way to go.  I love the game but I also really hate it because it really feels like we're the ones testing it.
---
I really don't know how to feel about the patches anymore because for every good thing I find gets fixed, I find two more things in the game that need fixing in the next patch.  There's just so much stuff that totally puzzles me as to how it ever needed fixing in the first place.  It really feels like we're testing the game.
---
In wow it would trigger a quest cinematic or npc dialog and the dungeon would close. In this at the least the scorched should shutdown
---
Is mayonnaise an instrument? 
---
That's fine, at least we know they will not be coming back. This is a long term support game, and they will shortly be adding new things in that makes they want to come back. They will have to buy new copies and start over without exploits if they do.
---
Wait, what is this developer room? I currently can't watch the video for another couple of hours.
---
That's the main quest 
---
Happy cake day!
---
Why not? Fix your game and they wont do it.
---
I dont exploit games btw. Read my first comment again. Carefully this time. Its not rocket science.
---
I noticed it and I dont have any mutations, but it might be placebo
---
Found a two shot flare gun. Sold it because it’s butfuck worthless
---
It's so damn hot... corn soup was a bad choice.
---
Why though? You walk up to the vendor and do your business, if other players or even the super mutants kill the monster you get some free stimpacks.
---
Right Mastercard has refused refunds as well dumbass
---
Bring lots of ammo and stimpacks. There are some workbenches inside, in case you need to make some emergency repairs, but they aren't everywhere. I'm on the opposite end of the spectrum from you - I tried to solo one around level 42 - and I failed, unfortunately. Spent around 30 to 45 minutes, and around 15 stimpacks and 200+ rounds of 308s and 45s. 
---
So I loaded back in after force closing and boom, 1fps then froze again. Like seriously what is this game
---
I have to drink purified water every 10-15 mins. Which is absolutely insane, I'm only level 10 and its crazy that I have to stop my quest just to go find water.
---
Lol. Strawman... but maybe. I don’t know how made that connection. Unless you mean a dealer would cut there stash with something and then the junkies would give him a bad rep. Then he gives that prime stuff and he regains the trust of the neighborhood junkies. And they are happy to see a positive change. Maybe even getting some junkies from the town next door with how good his stuff is. 
---
Not trying to be combative. Just trying to understand the metaphor. &lt;3
---
Only the best for people that do the equivalent of holding their hand in a fire then double/triple/quadruple checking the result.
---
Same here 
---
I play 99% solo and once in a while I run out of food. I have to scavenge every little house, most places are empty due to other players. That is when I really felt the world was "dead" and I had to fight to survive.
---
I like canned food due to no condition 😊
---
Where did it drop? OR are legendary weapon drops totally random? I really need one!
---
I see what you did there :3
---
If that's not worth it for you then what do you need them for anyway? Drop em and move on.
---
This brings new meaning to the phrase "I lost in PVP and the guy took my junk."
---
That 50cal sounds amazing
---
So for all you know the CTDs are from a completely unrelated problem but they've fixed what was lagging.
---
That is also uninformed speculation.
---
People who speculate on bug reports are the bane of my life, and those who escalate to insults when that is pointed out come second you fucking moron.
---
not on twitch but youtube, I'd recommend many a true nerd (aka the guy who made "Fallout 3 is better than you think")
---
They're pretty spread out, but I'll add them.
---
I like that it's there. I go there to sell stuff and if the event is going I'll run over, kill the thing, and move on. 
---
Lol, still here, #youhavenopowerhere
---
I really enjoy this game but it feels weird to me that a post thanking a game studio for updating their title is being upvoted so much. It feels like the bare minimum for a studio to update their title, especially one that started with so many bugs and let's be honest here, was unfinished.
---
Burn the infidel!
---
Nah I'm on pc and honestly have no interest in walking that distance lol. 
---
No, it just makes sense to because a PvE environment is always going to be different to a PvP one. It's not as simple as there being a magic number for weapon balance to be made between both settings because NPC enemies will have different strengths and weaknesses than player enemies will. Acting like that's not actually the case is an assertion in ignorance. Players aren't NPCs and having different challenges to face against both is what differentiates PvP and PvE, or they'd be the same thing.
---
I like how you're ruthless to dupers for exploiting a bug that's in the game. This game literally has no end game. No content added as of yet. This game is so poorly designed you can crash from going in your stash.
---
You can cry all you want about dupers, but the truth is, cant beat em? Join em. The weapons won't be deleted, and you'll either cry your eyes out about every time you die from a duplicated TSE or you'll get one and have a chance at killing people. Plus having a TSE doesn't even make you good. I've had a 3v10 at the ammo plant and lost 140 caps per death. I made 1000 caps from it. Just because you have a duplicated weapon doesn't mean you're good. The weapons aren't gonna disappear, either join the one-shot fest, sorry excuse for pvp in this game, or just play in passive mode 
---
I'll be sure to post an update when they get back to me.
---
I had a similar experience last night. Played about 2 hours total and crashed about 4 times. I was never in nuke zones or heavily populated areas, just doing random stuff. Also sometimes the loading screens look only half rendered now. This patch has a lot of great improvements, but I rarely crashed previously.
---
Gorge junkyard is a BLESSING! Also, there are a few black titanium deposits in the ash heao!
---
I've had that happen to my console since I got it half a year ago and I was playing FO4. The crashes don't discriminate by game for me and after going through some reinitializing and system refreshing troubleshooting on the PS support site, I finally got on chat with an actual rep and I'm sending it back to get totally wiped by PlayStation because it's just SO frustrating that all of the other fixes aren't...fixing it.
---
DING DING DING
---
It has been posted a few times. It happens when you rapidly shift weapons during reload I believe. 
---
Try unequipping both and switching servers/shards? 
---
Oh, nice. I'd like to run an explosives-centered build, but the splash damage is just so risky in many parts of the game.
---
There's just something so satisfying about making a really good grenade toss that wipes out an entire crowd.
---
Permabanning a paying customer for crashing servers?????? Are you serious????? Good god!!!!
---
(Gets the game drunk) shhhhhh its ok...
---
There's several videos that explain, just go to youtube and find one that makes sense.
---
Once you have the basics down, they are pretty easy. I suggest putting them in before you put in walls, as its easier. Same if you want a generator inside. 
---
If you haven't found them by this evening I'll just give them to you. Won't be on until around 7:00PM Eastern time though. Gamertag is the same as reddit name.
---
Tato corn and mutfruit, and purified water make vegetable starch at a cooking spot. Take the starch to a bench and break it down into adhesive. Boom. 
---
1 vegetable starch = 4 adhesive. 
---
Now if there was only a way to make gears and screws. 
---
They should have tried before the game came out instead of trying to make some quick money with a cash grab, but now it starts hurting then financially so they now they have to fix the game up
---
Huh. Is that getting patched on the 14th? 
---
Instead of banning them why not just delete their characters? It's not necessarily their fault the game had an exploit that allowed them to duplicate items.
---
Skyrim has been re-released a million times and still has launch bugs.
---
I’ll be on
---
I think they main reason they care is because it's an online game?
---
Don't think anyone ever got his Fallout 4 license revoked for exploiting anything.
---
Here's the thing about software.  At some point you don't really know what you should focus on fixing until it gets into the hands of the users and see their pain points.  That's an excellent place to release it.  
---
Otherwise you're going to never release it.  The Perfect is the enemy of The Good.
---
Building the plane after you take off isn’t a strategy. This was not a clever plan it is just damage control. I am happy they are fixing the problems I love the game. This just wasn’t a grand plan. It is an “oh shit” moment that they are now realizing is an issue. There is a scene from Futurama I like to reference at the office. Kip tells Captain Bradigan there is a problem and he replied “come back when it’s a catastrophe”. 
---
Taking radiation damage gives you the chance to get a mutation. This has an internal cool down of 30 minutes, or until you switch servers. All the various mutations give you different advantages, but at a cost. Such as +4 perception and 25% crit damage, with a negative modifier of -4 strength.
---
You can maintain your mutations with the Strached Genes perk, and the Class Freak perk will reduce the negatives by 75% at max rank. I personally run around with all 18 and feel like a super hero
---
This is the most blatant shilling ive ever seen
---
Monday
---
It sounds like you will enjoy it.  
---
The game and server stability is worrying though.  The game has been out for almost 2 months now.  We're kind of getting to the point where if it's not fixed soon, it's hard to see it ever getting drastically improved in that regard.
---
Maybe don't start your replies with insults? My point was that imo the game could have been leagues ahead of where it is today if it never saw the drop off. 
---
Matter of fact, if anyone has a temper it’s you. I’ve told you several times that *you* are the one who has no power here and you won’t win. Bethesda is hashtagging you with their ballsacks. 
---
You’ve deflected from wanting a refund to potentially wanting emotional support when you have stated on several other occasions that you want Bethesda employees to see this. 
---
You’ve also mentioned that you want to make other people aware of this game but turn around and tell me that you’re not talking to us. 
---
You want a refund because you no longer enjoy the game but plan to get your refund from MasterCard under the guise of “false advertisement.” 
---
You’ve publicly stated your intent to commit fraud because you simply do not enjoy a game and a company that is under no obligation to refund you, is refusing to refund you. 
---
What are you, a toddler? This literally isn’t how anything works. 
---
Do they give scrap or ore? I honestly haven't taken a workshop since they nerfed production rates, and I heard they made minerals drop ore instead of scraps. 
---
Whelp, there goes the entire gov't.
---
I spent my first 150 hours and 3 character builds exploring every POI, doing all the story, and diving deep into the unmarked spots on the map to find easter eggs and hidden treasure.  I have spent the 180 hours after doing that, re-exploring, trying new builds, hunting bounties, showing friends around the game, and just generally enjoying and sharing what it has to offer.  
---
Yes, you will absolutely get your ticket price out of it.  I love the game in spite of it's (shrinking) flaws.
---
If I could give this more upvotes I would.
---
Avoidable with Dense chest mod and newly changed Fireproof perk. Results in immunity to explosive damage. Means the TSE user won’t be in PA, but whatever. 
---
As long as it flags you for PvP so I can give you your deserved recompense for lighting up near me.
---
Now Bethesda should do what the creators of Day Break games did.  If you want your account back, you must upload a public video to YouTube apologizing for cheating it must include your face. Lol
---
The problem is that the deathclaw attacks people that haven’t done anything, even teammates. I think the deathclaw is the only tame that does this. I just want to know if he will respawn if killed.
---
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
---
If it's easy then do it.  Don't forget to make it for all systems or have any unintended side effects like removing maps, armor, nukas, and meds the stuff also duped.
---
Then why to a bunch of the Korean MMOs do exactly this?
---
All I have to do is show it is possible for Bethesda to do it, You need to give a reason it can't.
---
The PvPvE server already works to some degree, if they are keeping that, then they will need the same balance that PvP and PvE needs. 
---
There you go, interpreting your own way and making judgements.
---
Yes, theres fault in the robber as well of course. In not blaming the victim ffs.
---
But if your leave your door unlocked, and you get robbed you are to  blame as well.
---
Look, im against Bethesda blaming gamers for their incompetence. Is this simple. People are making a big fuss out of what i wrote. But its very simple. Banning is excessive. Fix your game first, then we can talk abou banning.
---
Yeah I agree. It was only a theory. Yeah it’s outlandish, and would be poor planning on Beth’s part. I don’t disagree the “plane” should have been air worthy before it launched. 
---
I don't know what he's talking about with adding weight... there's like 2 things that are lighter.  I think there was one that was heavier but that was just fixed.  It was just that the cost was 10 and bulk returned 15.  They updated it to cost 15 so it's even now.  Everything else was equal minus the 2 plastic it cost to bulk it.
---
Bloodied or instigating(better for mobbing) grognaks axe w/ 15 strength maxed out slugger cards, adrenal reaction w/ low health, twisted muscles, bloody mess, incisor. Also unyielding (might be thinking of bolstering?) armor at low health effects melee damage. Full unyielding armor at low health will give you an additional 15 points of strength. pretty much just tried to get as much damage as possible through mutations and perk cards and armor. Your damage starts to add up very quick
---
It is a beautiful game, if you like exploring I think you'd like it. Us high level dicks have ruined some areas, though. 
---
The Mole Miners give Black Titanium for their breathing and clothing too. 
---
My brother married a Mole Miners Daughter. 
---
 Heck stored items for stacked crops and purifiers.   Also if you stored stuff that was wired without scrapping the connecting copper wire first, it glitches a a hidden amount of the budget. 
---
When in doubt,  rebuild from scratch. 
---
Also there are multiple points on the map that have junk piles you can build an extractor on if you make your camp there!
---
How do you do so? I definitely want to look
---
Oooh I have no idea, I used them pre nerf. My bad!
---
 You can get mirelurk eggs in Grafton Dam from within the pipe inside down at the bottom. 
---
I was actually wondering about this. I am currently on my 2nd character and took the Cannibal perk as I am rping a wildman-savage type. I hope that the capacity for eating defeated foe players wasn't a bug and stays an option for when I am strong enough to actually PvP.
---
Last time I saw it they forgot to remove the words "Elder Scrolls Online" from the email. This time they even fixed the color scheme.
---
I'm not speculating, I'm talking from my experience. But thanks for sharing.
---
You’re a bad liar lol. 
---
I can agree with you here. Some sort of a "You've defeated the Queen. Fissure Prime has been closed for x amount of time."  
---
Scorched shutting down as a whole, no, because while we have shut down the production of scorch beasts, they haven't been erradicated yet. We would still have to go through the rest of the map and kill them off before the scorched would die off.
---
I noticed that it queues your power armor there if it gets hit while you try to deposit ingredients. So I suggest killing everything before depositing the cans.
---
YES PURGE AWAY THESE EXPLOITING SCUMBAGS ! BURN THEM WITH BURNING HOLY FIRE ! 
---
All DLC will be free as of now
---
Happy Cake day!
---
Lol, yeah the mole miner scrap has black titanium. I didn't know anybother part did, though. 
---
Hey guys, I took every drug in my medicine cabinet, I think I might be dying, anyone know why?
---
Seriously. Mutations have benefits and drawbacks. Research them and use selectively. Ignorantly grabbing everything gets you no sympathy from me.  
---
I agree. Play the whole game.
---
Why don't you just trade the caps back if your'e goofing off with your friends?
---
Believe me I’m not complaining or trying to fix it haha but thanks for the info I couldn’t find anything on it
---
Oh i found a exploiting tarded scumbag ! 
---
All good, I'm in the same boat,  lol
---
This is SOLID. GOLD.
---
SHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! 
---
Knocking over petrified corpses of course! 
---
(Disclaimer: paddle ball sold separately)
---
According to the patch notes they believe they have fixed this particular bug.  Now the people that knowingly exploited it, which is against the TOS, are being banned.  Sounds like normal operating procedure to me.  Are you worried about being banned or something?  Hindsight is 20/20.  I haven't used any exploits, therefore I have nothing to worry about.  It will be nice when every other server I join doesn't lag and crash because someone wanted to dupe 30,000 Stimpaks.
---
I currently have an alcohol addiction and it’s not affecting anything 
---
OH banning a costumer that harms ANY other costumer and Exploitng the system to make money with it ? HOW COULDNT WE NOT BAN HIM !
---
Nice. "Army intelligence" "Light infantry" heh heh yeah those are the two biggest ones
---
I'm an explorer-type too. Less into the run &amp; gun of trying to get to the strongest build or rarest items the fastest. Totally enjoying just cruising around and taking in the story pieces and the different locations. 
---
Thank you for voicing this! (well typing i guess?) I was wondering why you could not use the PF with PA? Maybe too much power? ... forget I put in that last line.
---
180 hours there must be a emotional attachment I just don’t get it why play a game for almost 200 hours that you claim to hate I really want to know why?? Not trolling is it really buyers remorse? 
---
Mining ore, etc, also eats up your ammo.
---
It just works!
---
Each faction had a nice ground work set.  Cryptos, Responders Main Terminal, MODUS, Abby's bunker could be used for Free States further using the Scorched Detection System.  Then you could even add several city based Factionless daily rotating quests.  Grafton already  has these, but Watoga coulud easily have this as well.  Then Vault based dailies as well...   
---
YES BAN THESE EXPLOITING SCUMBAGS !
---
Uh oh. I make a lot of food a lot...and healing salves. So many that I get "server not responding" pretty often. 
---
RIP me :(
---
Already did that :( need to know the quantity for each junk worth keeping
---
Why don't you just stop digging? You've passed the 6 foot mark a while ago.
---
Yeah, I keep hoping they'll change how Teams work for that same reason - I hate feeling like I can't use certain weapons because I'd one-shot everything and end up 'cheating' my friends out of XP. Especially when they just run off on their own and kill everything in one hit themselves. It almost feels like we're stuck competing with each other for XP and loot, even while on a team, when it *should* be a cooperative experience.
---
I really wish they'd just let everyone on a Team share XP for kills any of them get (so long as they're within a reasonable distance, anyway). And just flat-out guarantee loot for the same (I think it works that way already, but I'm never sure - sometimes I get loot, sometimes i don't, and I dunno which is which or why).
---
Of course, if I could, I'd take things even a step further and have Legendary enemies just be lootable by everyone that was nearby, even if they're not on a team or did damage. It's frustrating enough to run across a Legendary enemy and *know* you probably won't get anything worthwhile - it's even more aggravating to not even get the chance to get probably crappy loot because it got blown away by someone else before you could land a hit.
---
If fallout 76 came out November this year and could be played offline, people would forgive it's shortcomings but it's just a mess. It's gonna take some no man sky like updates for this game to be decent.
---
I think it depends on the resource if they give scrap or ore. The thing is, if you keep it going, you end up with a lot. 
---
Still, if you do it for the potential plans and recipes, and defend it several times, while your waiting for the next wave of attackers, the extractors are busy chugging away! 
---
Collect, and smelt it! 
---
Good job thanking a company that sent out a unfinished broke fucking game buddy...
---
Your thanking them to be a beta tester for a game that the majority paid 60$ or more for.
---
Could also make 3 to 5 duplicates become an extra point to assign
---
You only get half the bounty. Say if you shoot a building a destory it you will gain 10, cap bounty people would see 5 and claim 5. Id you have 1000 then its 500 to be claimed. So it does sink caps over time.
---
Because nobody here knows what they have planned for future patches and content so aren't in a position yet to judge whether it actually is "above and beyond". That doesn't preclude us from appreciating the work done they've done so far. Everybody who plays Bethesda games knows just how shit they always are at release AND YET continues to buy them. I'm gonna beat this analogy to death:
---
 A diner can be a total dive with inconsistent service and long wait times, but if the food is good enough or special enough people will keep coming back, hell the food could be a heart attack on a fucking bun but damn it has that secret sauce on it so I'm sure as hell coming back for more. Every now and then you'll get some uppity shithead who walks in and calls it out for what it is, but everyone there already knows it and doesn't care because they are getting precisely what they expected.
---
Geez, how can the game possibly get boring with 200,000 small guns bobbleheads and a copy of every tse handmade in the game?
---
you can’t use atoms you upgrade stash
---
I roleplay Mad Max when it's time to eat. 
---
No. Yesterday i took 5 in a row.
---
Now if you have a shit internet connection and experience lag plus high latency I'd take then slowly.
---
I play alone mainly set out to find stuff to make my house cooler
---
Aw. that’s disappointing 
---
Is there any real advantage to scorched killer? It reduces base damage compared to hardened or prime, and the 50% bonus afaik is put on to the damage after dr calculation, not before, so it's in reality not even that high. Prime receivers need ultracite ammo but it's honestly not hard to get once you're at the point of farming scorchbeast queens. 
---
Had a Mexican stand off the one and only time people were doing Monster Mash. Four of us, staring at each and the mask, we all knew who ever made the first move is dead...
---
Good, ban those glitch shearing idiots.
---
...can you explain why..?
---
While thats true, if it actually works what they announce it shouldn't be worth a post all with caps. I feel we are not quite that depserate yet.
---
The thing is, it gives out really good rewards! I got two fusion cores and a Gauss rifle, I’ve seen people get laser and plasma Gatlings from it. I’d love to complete it daily to get the rewards but things like D/Cs in your case and not being able to repeat dailies ruins it.
---
Was on a team of three last night and we were all crashing to desktop (not disconnected) about once every 20 minutes. Definitely a higher level of client crashes since the Jan patch.
---
you have to look closely at a poster or advertisement for it, then it will give you the quest. I believe the charleston fire dept has a poster but i know i've seen them elsewhere too
---
I get it. Just watch your condition. That can go fast!
---
Any word on Herd Mentality and Empath as they relate to Class freak?  At the very least, they are not displaying right in the UI.  Not clear to me that Empath specifically is mitigated by class freak at all.
---
Fair enough, it's not for everyone to struggle for no real reason. Take care.
---
Are you me
---
It is. But, who’s the say with any future DLC that the cap won’t be increased? It’s be interesting to see if they do. 
---
Damn, level 44 and that still hasn’t dropped for me. Didn’t even know it existed until this thread. 
---
That sniper rifle isn’t the only thing that’s hardened.
---
Quest items never persist beyond a re login on my radial menu.
---
White Knight = mandatory perk :/ There just isn’t enough ballistic fiber in the game.
---
Which would definitely be a problem because then people could dupe items via vendor
---
That is one of the most asinine things you've probably posted in a while.
---
Did I shit on him for not posting his specs? No. You obviously, can't read. I need the information TO HELP him. You're doing nothing but trying to start shit.
---
You obviously don't know how computers work nor how to trouble shot them or the programs on them, so don't interject yourself in between the conversations of two adults. 
---
Where can we expect to find them? I love my sniper rifle.
---
Yeah you should be good. Surprised the hell out of me as well. Hope they keep it around. 
---
Facking magnets!
---
&gt; Because nobody here knows what they have planned for future patches and content so aren't in a position yet to judge whether it actually is "above and beyond". That doesn't preclude us from appreciating the work done they've done so far.
---
This makes absolutely no sense so let's take it in two sections:
---
Nobody knows what they have planned for the future. Okay, so we don't need to thank or praise them for it since we don't know what it is.
---
It doesn't preclude us from appreciating the work they have done so far. Back to my point, why are we thankful for 'bringing the game up to a releasable standard'?
---
&gt;Everybody who plays Bethesda games knows just how shit they always are at release AND YET continues to buy them.
---
Until now.
---
&gt;A diner can be a total dive with inconsistent service and long wait times, but if the food is good enough or special enough people will keep coming back, hell the food could be a heart attack on a fucking bun but damn it has that secret sauce on it so I'm sure as hell coming back for more. Every now and then you'll get some uppity shithead who walks in and calls it out for what it is, but everyone there already knows it and doesn't care because they are getting precisely what they expected.
---
And I would laugh at everyone dropping $60 on a greasy spoon while 'uppity shitheads' from the prime steakhouse next door were getting so much more for their money. It's fine if you want to sit in your dive bar and say 'We are happy to pay premium prices for tasty garbage'. Just don't be surprised when people paying less for tasty not-garbage laugh at it.
---
And on average, all the players in the 600's have looted themselves, again.. on average.. 8 TSE weapons?  That's interesting.  No dupes right?  Like you talked to a bunch of people in the 600 hour range and they told you they didn't buy a duped TSE?
---
Addicted to psycho once very early in game where my level 10 ass wandered into a gang of level 30 super mutants and ended up constantly popping psycho to make it out alive 
---
You sure? I'd love to actually use a sniper again!
---
Maybe one day ill be herded. Maybe not.
---
Don't worry, I was at like 170 hours when I find my first TSE. I still have only found one explosive weapon (other than the TSE) and two or three two-shots.
---
Did they increase the TTK? I heard something about them doing that post-release. I just remember in the beta, it was definitely lower and it turned my friends and I away from it.
---
They can always just pull a mass effect andromeda or pull a no man sky go silent for months but there not they are trying in a sea of hate and ridicule and I appreciate it give props when due nothing wrong with that no one is saying silence criticism or anything like that just giveing props cause I believe many other company face with this much hate would abandon there game.
---
Prey came out in 17 and I think Dishonored 2 came out in 16
---
Pipe pistols seem pretty garbage, but bolt-action pipe guns w/ proper mods can sub in as sniper rifles at half-or-less the weight of similar hunting rifle. (though I'd agree, it's more a problem of the hunting rifles getting way too heavy when modded) 
---
Sounds like a great plan, haha.
---
me 1 shotting mobs is one of the biggest things i hate about teaming up with my friends. since they're in their 20s most of the mobs are less than 45 and i have to purposefully equip bad weapons i find along the way just so they can have a chance at participating. 
---
The patch notes came out only yesterday, and said that PC gets the rollout first (also yesterday), and consoles get it a few days after (Monday). 
---

---
The Bethesda "Inside the Vault" came out on the 9th, and gave a brief idea of what to expect for the rest of January
---
[https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/3wohkyIGcEOE8gayy6yCMg/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-9-2019](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/3wohkyIGcEOE8gayy6yCMg/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-9-2019)
---
I fortold this, first they cut the head off the snake and then they take care of the rest of the trash following behind them. Good job Bethesda!
---
Bahaha, i saw all these down votes. So one form of cheating is ok, the other isnt. Anyone who says otherwise is a hypocrite.  So moral of thr story  dupe what you want glitch what you want and some person will complain because they are a have not.
---
I would like to see something in the vein of the Wasteland Workshop dlc for FO4. A few new workshops around the map where a proprietor can host arena matches or something like that. The game, in it's current state, is still pretty far off from something like this being viable. But nothing says wasteland like Thunderdome.
---
Technically you don’t have to option to accept or decline only to leave the quest incomplete. 
---
Try it, each quest leads into another one - right from the moment you start a new game.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
---
Could be good or bad tbh 
---
You'll enjoy the game the most
---
Thats terrible mindset to have in gaming lol 
---
Care to share the link? Just curious because I don't think I heard that before.
---
Lol, here's a reason, loot boxes are considered illegal in some places, and I find gambling immoral. Will that sate your understanding? You know they will be implemented so might as well clear my conscience.
---
Almost heaven, legendary rifles
---
Blue Ridge gunners, Shenandoah sniper
---
Life is good now, getting better
---
Faster reloading, aiming is a breeze
---
What the other person said, but explosive also scales with demolition expert here
---
i only now realised how karma works, and no, i give a shit about it
---
I was still using level 1 and 5 at level 40....I thought ahead and saved as much as possible between modding and crafting.
---
What makes you think that NPCs are going to work ANY differently from the 2 servers?
---
Let's be reasonable
---
Single vs multi-player
---
Reaching an un reachable zone vs creating tons of items 
---
Those who played red or blue are likely to have cheated themselves more items 
---
But it was a single player
---
If you play a single player with wall hack so be it, if you do it on a public server you wreck the game of everyone else 
---
If I need 1h for 1 item to grind and you get 100 in 5 minutes, is it fair, is it harmful to the economy,.. 
---
It depends on the game mode and or the exploit if you want to comment how fair it is 
---
Thanks for testing!
---
Sincerely,
---
A ps4 player. 
---
I play what sounds similar to you. Just go in eyes open, realize it is different. It has limits because it is online but make your own judgement. 
---
If you like Fallout - I believe you will like this. 
---
Probably the best part is these weren't introduced until after duping got patched, so there will never be a dirty hunting rifle out there
---
You'll love it. 
---
The nerfing isn’t really as bad as they are making it out to be. I grab gorges Junkyard pretty much every time I play and put a titanium and Junk extractor, plus its a great spot to be able to fast travel for free to. (Also, you don’t use your own resources when taking workshops if it’s in green when you’re building it) 
---
You don't need to be high level to craft Cranberry Relish and I think it's the most useful food in the game. 
---
(I know the OP said he'll cover crops in his next post but just a heads up for those that want to know)
---
Grab the Gourd in the Greenhouse at Hornwright Summer Villa, plant it at your camp. Increase your Gourd crop by harvesting and replanting. Once you have 6 plants then gather Cranberries just south of Aaronholt Homestead (pretty sure there are 6 plants here too). Then go to Landview Lighthouse and run SE to the river, follow the river all the way to the railway bridge gathering the Snaptail Reeds along the way.
---
Now you can make at least 6 Cranberry Relish for 6 hours of 10% bonus XP. I never leave camp without it and have it running on all my alts.
---
At higher level yo can increase the yield/rate of production by getting more Gourds from Rayliegh Clay's Bunker together with more Cranberries from the Mirelurk Queen pond at Sunrise Field.
---
I agree.  If you look at ALL of the patch notes, it includes TONS of stuff we've been asking for here.
---
They're doing a good job.  A bit too slowly for my taste, but they're moving in the right direction.
---
Mutations only, since you cannot wear armor with hazmat.
---
The chameleon mutation might work with hazmat as well, but I have not tested that. In theory, you could become even harder to spot then. And should they ever allow underarmor to be worn with hazmat then you can go up to 21 agility, although I doubt you will notice any differences at that point.
---
Cheating is cheating! Ban them all. Make the wasteland great again.
---
So people who don't have it getting it's effects? Because I don't have any mutations at the moment. If that's the case hopefully it gets fixed
---
Reaching again. 
---
Other than online speculation, there is no proof such a thing will exist. 
---
You’re such a baby. 
---
A well-deserved death. Bring them all down.
---
Like a sheep?
---
I liked the Cold Case quest too.  
---
SPOILER for the COLD CASE quest.
---
&gt;!I hope we see more of Freddy when they open the other vaults and maybe get human NPCs.  I'm assuming that he made it to one of the other vaults that are still closed and should still be 35-40 years old by now i'm guessing.  Seems like quite a little resourceful kid and would do well in the wasteland. !&lt;
---
And this is crazy to me. You would have thought they would have made the slap damage a base number like 2 how no matter what you use. Blows my mind.
---
And it's still entirely possible to recreate that in fallout 4. There's already mods that do something  like this. I recommend approaching this with skepticism. The weapon stealing exploit from a few weeks ago is currently believed to be fake. It's not unreasonable to expect that there could be a copy cat. I'm not saying it's definitely fake, but until it's confirmed by a reputable source I'll continue to hold onto my suspicions.
---
1) PC  
---
2) Vaalus  
---
3) Don't have one currently as my pet glitched away and won't come back, but there are many screenshots online of deathclaw pets at camps with red names and health bars.  
---
4) The Animal Friend and Wasteland Whisperer perks do not properly tame creatures.  Deathclaw, Mega Sloth, and Yao Guai (for certain) can be tamed but remain hostile to anyone but the player, maintain their red name and health bar, and will chase players for hundreds of feet when they come near the camp (especially the Deathclaw).    
---
All pets seem to randomly spawn dead at times and will eventually disappear completely (not sure if the last part is a bug or not)
---
Never said or implied that.
---
Haven't crashed a single time since patch, even during a spammy queen scorchbeast fight.
---
We were told before the beta that there would be unlimited stash storage. Then for the beta they temporarily reduced it to 400, with promises of upping it after. Then they upped it to 600 with talks of "maybe upping it in the future". 
---
Yeah its like having anti grief on. You wont be instantly killed by people for the most part. If theyre stacking bobbleheads there's not much you can do but a majority of griefers dont use bobble heads. Either way by removing only 45% of the explosive damage most can survive a explosive pump action. Depending on endurance ect.
---
I'm lost, I took a wrong turn at Albuquerque...
---
This guy didn't say he had any of these things and since they're so rare it seems unlikely he has them
---
ah ok, I havent heard that. Was thinking about the release itself yes.
---
Sweet, Thanks for the tip! I needed a place to test my deathclaw gauntlet.
---
People are hearing your contrary opinions loud and clear.  They have no obligating to entertain them as correct or valid.  Which they aren't.  The free market of thoughts and ideas is coming down hard on you right now.  Perhaps take that as a sign?  Or just keep yelling at the wave as it crashes into you.  What you do with your free time is up to you.
---
You say " You cant compare cheating in a videogame with robbery." 
---
What would you say to people selling the items they've duped, hundreds or thousands of times, on websites for real money, profiting directly from abusing an exploit? Also, by doing so causing game instability (Servers hitch very hard when dupers open their inventory) for those who had NOTHING to do with the use of the exploit. If at that critical moment a duper causes a server hitch, you were fighting a tough fight. Due to the server hitching, you died. The Duper Robbed YOU of your life in the game, Robbed YOU of time spent getting back to your loot, if it's even still there, and you weren't disconnected from the server. 
---
I say "You CAN compare cheating in a videogame with robbery."
---
I agree.
---
What we REALLY need is a youtube video with a thumbnail that has red arrows pointing to the star, the name, the stats, and a couple just pointing at the gun
---
I take it you know everything?
---
The mental gymnastics people are going through in this thread to defend duping should be in the Olympics.  
---
Like all the scorched around here.
---
Nope. Clearly you super drunk on Old Possum and did it yourself. /s
---
Good. Ban every single youtuber who thinks its cool to show others how to exploit the game. Bethesda needs to start making an example of people who do this kinda shit to prevent others from doing it as well
---
If the bad release of fallout 76 make them do a better work with the elder scrolls 6, it's worth it really.
---
Idk about anyone else, but I am looking forward to when/if they enable private servers, as I am hoping there will be people who: 1) want to run a role play server and 2) in having the private servers, maybe there can be some world-state persistency -which I believe is a major area that this game lacks.
---
Same with Gatling? Like anything that has to do with hand movement?
---
Corporate world works differently then the creative. Sadly corporate world wins out. Ost of the time.
---
hmm maybe I should until the refund goes through.
---
Short answer.. yes!
---
Longer answer.. I am the same way, and had a hard time putting the controller down. I'm probably hitting the 150 hour mark soon I think
---
I finally got mine the other day, only to discover that it's really not much more useful than just having Marsupial, which you can get a lot easier. Maybe could be if I spec'd in Endurance to get more APs, but who does that?
---
Bigger stash is definitely my #1 request.  Loving the game right now except for that.
---
If they're having problems with database recall times / lag, they can always do this:
---
All Junk, Ammo, and Aid (without condition bars) is unlimited. It doesn't take any more time for a database to recall 10 steel as it does 1,000 steel. It's a line item name and a numerical value.
---
Since there are so many variants and conditions of armor and weapons and food items (literally millions if you take all the variables in), make that a FIXED number of slots in your stash (as many as they can get in there without lag).  So you could store 100 armor or weapons or food items.
---
If it's a database retrieval problem, that would fix it :)
---
Look, I'm not gonna defend people who preorder. Cause that's fucking stupid no matter what company, but. Hell, lets be honest with ourselves, most consumers, not like y'know people who are more into the hobby, just consumers. 
---
Are just gonna watch the trailers, maybe the E3 presentations, and be like OH THIS IS COOL. Bought. That's the people the industry preys on. The same people who defended this game after release. The same people who think Skyrim is like the Messiah of gaming and the best RPG game around. I think if you preorder, that's on you if you get shafted. But wasn't the game 60$ even after release? For a while anyways?
---
lol what?!
---
You dont need a 20% damage reduction? Its literally the best defensive perk in the game
---
This was back in Vanilla.   I remember running it with some regularity but I don't think my guild ever cleared it.
---
There are bylaws and laws for this. Yes stealing a car is breaking the federal and state law and municiple law however speed limits are bylaws.
---
I thought it was just me.  😯😂
---
None. There are enough different chems that you can cycle through them very easy and avoid addiction.  I honestly think the only people getting addicted are those who don't pay attention, or those who simply want to be addicted (maybe for a weapon effect, or daddy issues.) Kind of like real life?
---
Stop, hammer time!
---
I feel like its expected for there to be bugs for a short time after release, even serious bugs in the short term because of the nature of massive games like Fallout and Skyrim. New Vegas was pretty rough on 360 when I first got it as a teenager but I still thoroughly enjoyed it even with some quest-breaking bugs. 
---
Oh but they are entertaining my opinions!
---
The thing is, when someone missreads your comments and blind hates you for no reason, you realize theres something wrong in display.
---
I take as a sign that Bethesdas community management did a terrific job in this sub reddit. Todd should give them a raise.
---
My free time is my own concern yes. Thank you.
---
It was but only for a week or two. I get being upset at predatory publishers. I really do. It's unacceptable. But it is the responsibility of consumers to do research into what they're spending money on. I don't feel bad for folks that don't spend their money wisely and then complain about what they spent money on. 
---
I know how to test software. I know that systems that support massive user load don't require a massive user base to test. I know that other game studios somehow manage to put things out of higher quality than Bethesda so it's not an industry problem.
---
I also know that this game is getting way more leeway than it has any right to because people with no idea drop knowledge bombs like 'Of course things will break you don't know how they will work until players start using them'.
---
And make mexico pay for it
---
where do I start it?
---
It is a massive beautiful world that I get to explore with my other Fallout loving friends. Yeah, it might still have a few bugs, but it is so amazing!
---
Well again, a resource area taken just to be taken (not used, as I said) and then destroying my completely (as we had run across one another before the workshop so he knew where my camp was).
---
But at this point this sorta comment is expected. Like I said earlier, I just needed to rant like the world is ending. Better vent out even if it's bitching :3
---
I hear you, and I agree. I think it’s called “overtuned at release” haha. They tried to anticipate a balance problem too much and made it suck too much instead. 
---
But as for your suggestion: I like it. I want it. I think it should’ve always been that way. I think the devs need to just throw us a bone in this one, cause right now it’s a hit to quality of life that’s unnecessary, and even more so after a patch that added ballistic fiber to armor crafting requirements. 
---
What I do is always shut the door behind me to my cabin and if it’s open when I come back that usually means someone did
---
One of my favorite lines in that movie. 
---
I want to crucify my enemies!
---
"Ok here's a reason they can't.
---
Perks."
---
WELL SHIT that looks a lot like you didn't just imply it, you DIRECTLY stated it.
---
We bought a work in progress! Bethesda have produced some pretty amazing games in the past and hopefully will in the future (*cough* Elder Scrolls 6). This game will only get better with continued community support, and criticism when needed.
---
Thanks. I’m not well-versed in Bethesda IPs aside from their big names. I’m sure they made money, but for the casuals and hardcore alike Fallout/TES and all of their merchandise probably makes them the most money and probably contributed then as to why they released 76 so quickly.
---
The rng doesn't help either. Plus not knowing what mods you still need to get.
---
The perk system funnels you down a specific path, so the best bet is to narrow down your build and get perks that will compliment it.
---
If your building towards weapon X but don't have it available yet, just use whatever crap you have available and don't bother upgrading it if you don't have the spare materials available. It's not worth it to repair the modded weapons early on because you don't have the aluminum and adhesive to spare. It's easy enough to get to 50, you're better off waiting till then to start amassing the mods and focus then on the particular weapon you want to use. 
---
It's meant to be a progression wall, or else you'd have a suped up weapon the second you unlock it. As the weapon becomes more complex, so does maintenance, which logically makes sense. Hunting rifle is perfectly fine, I just wouldn't bother with modding it up because you are going to outgrow the level and then all those mats you poured into it are wasted. 
---
I wish there was an easier way to do this.
---
I don't watch computer based TV / Movies and I don't have a TV downstairs.
---
Nobody wants to hop a vendor 1,099 times to get 1 item.  That's just insane.
---
Careful, if they questify as a stack, you will lose all 50 and they will merge into one document.
---
Try grabbing one from your container and:  
---
A) Going into your quest tab to see if its there but just not active and activate it as a quest you are following
---
B) Try turning it in without a quest for it and see if it gives you rewards anyways.
---
Stop grabbing all 50 though they all merge now and you can no longer hold more than one. When Im in a silo I often see upwards of 5 but no matter how many I grab they dont stack, they just merge.
---
adding thousands upon thousands of items to the game would definitely make the game more unstable. This is fairly easily proven by 3 points. original carry weight glitch. stash limit. the ridiculous freeze ups that occur when scrapping over 100 - 200 lbs over capacity
---
Just want to add to this, and probably most of you know. If you go to the junk tab in your pipboy and then press the button for 'component view', it will  show you the list of all the junk you have on you(Not in your stash) in the scrapped form. You can then tag it for search and a magnifying glass will appear next to it(like FO4). When its tagged, if your cursor is aimed at a junk item you haven't picked up yet, for example a typewriter or desk fan, and scrapping it will give you a junk item you tagged for search, a magnifying glass will appear next to the name of the junk item so you know that you can scrap it for what you are searching for. This way you can go about only picking up things that you know will give you what you need, and you won't miss picking up something you didnt know would give you something you wanted. Hope this makes sense lol
---
It’s a legal binding contract, you break it you suffer the terms and conditions set forth by the statutes within the contract. You take it to court chances are the court will rule in favor of the holder of the contract. Those who break contracts aren’t exactly favored 
---
No mutations here. No problem! 
---
They at least patched SOME of the "items going into roof or floor" with the latest patch.. I have to wait until mine gets fixed on Monday to test if the power connectors will be better or not.
---
You save 5-8 perk points.
---
Scorchbeast queen maybe? But furious? Idk its ight
---
Where in game were you, and what platform?
---
I've noticed there's trouble spots, and that if youre on XB1 you're basically rekt by DCs.
---
Their only real mistake (game-wise, merch stuff speaks for itself) was not just making it Early Access. PUBG proved that an unfinished work-in-progress can still be massively profitable under this model, but Bethesda wanted something on shelves and I think they lost a lot of money and good will as a result.
---
Was a reply to the first one. 
---
You’re not trying hard enough anymore! 
---
I'm an ass, I lock my door. 
---
See, that's why I have set things up to display component parts on the names of things, so I only grab junk I actually need and can do so quickly.  I don't grab all the weapons as, well, most of the guns in the game are non viable (even the ones that are super fun to use like the mg42) and the ones that are viable I know most all the mods on, or can craft myself to learn the mods from
---
Is the .50 hardened finally a thing?
---
If they really worded it as “free updates” (I’m not sure if that was just a summary on your part) but if they worded it like that they probably meant they would do what GTA Online does and release new content instead of meaning that they’re going to fix all the bugs in their game in free updates
---
Honestly I prefer to play solo, my friend doesnt like to take his time and wants to rush through everything where I am in every nook and crany trying to read up on lore or put together the theme of the area we'd be in. 
---
&gt; Would you rather Bethesda not release the game at all and just bury the franchise in a shallow grave?
---
I'd rather they release it when it is an releasable state.
---
&gt;Holy fucking shit why does anyone have to explain why they are grateful to a company for righting a wrong?
---
'Hey man, thanks for shitting on me then wiping it off.'
---
&gt;I, like a lot of people, am just happy to get to play more fallout because I fucking love fallout.
---
Brand loyalty is cancerous to innovation and industry progress. If they already know the sales are tied to the brand not the actual quality then guess what happens to the quality.
---
Thumbs up! Fallout 76 is my favorite Fallout game to date. I am currently a level 79 and I have no desire to slow down at all.
---
I have 15 Endurance for HP to be a tank, can't say I notice much of a difference with AP though I thought that was agility?
---
[Interact with the Excavator power armor posters outside of Garrahan Mining HQ.](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Miner_Miracles)
---
Yeah well seemingly, as it's unconfirmed but more or less following what evidence I had, it was just for fun. On his end that is. Get a giggle in from smashing a player and then leveling his camp. 
---
But I can also see your point in wanting to test things out. But honestly this was a little more than that XD
---
Lol strawman.  You averaged *something*.  In your mind somewhere you had some perceived data.  Or you don't know what average means.  Or what data is.
---
Eh. I'm not super worried since you can learn mods from any level armor.
---
This combat armor set is about to be a grind and a fuckin half though.
---
No from me 
---
Oh thanks! I misread and thought it was raised but cost more.
---
See I've got a life saving trapper arm.  Just wish that instead of dropping premade legendaries enemies dropped legendary effect mods for armor/weapons that we, the players, got to put on what weapon/armor we wanted, have it look like a token with a symbol for what group it's for, like a gun for guns, a knife for melee and the armor symbol for armor
---
Or make junk you need a mutation, call it shopaholic or something.
---
I completely agree because I have a furious Gatling gun with all of the mods on it except for that stupid bayonet of course and it's very hard to aim. 
---
Until I learned something...
---
If you go into third person mode you get a DOT. It can be hard to see sometimes but the dot Is really good for shooting the Gatling gun. The only problem is if you aim down sights sometimes you'll get stuck in that zoomed area and not be able to get out of 3rd person view.
---
If you go this route and get stuck in it aim with the left trigger again and then hit the 3rd person view and you should be able to get out.
---
Alternatively stay in first person view and pulled the trigger to start firing and then aim with left trigger. The standard Crosshair will stay on the screen.
---
Until they actually fix the site on the gun this is the best you can do.
---
Hey! I'll destroy it! I'll go to The Fissure and drop it into the abysse whence it came! Pinky sweared!
---
The gat is way more ammo/repair efficient, and it’s very good accuracy makes it great for small targets. 50cal *i believe* does more raw damage to big targets like scorchbeasts due to its very high rate of fire, but it’s lower accuracy and much bigger spread make it less effective against small/distant targets as lots of the bullets miss. 
---
The other ballistic HW just have too low of damage in spite of their ROF to really be worth it. The energy weapons actually do ok, but have such horrible durability (and in the case of the gat plasma, the massive spread/recoil) that they just don’t hold up. Laser gat has weak damage but you can get a LOT of rounds out of fusion cores with the fusion core duration perk. Plasma does good damage but breaks fast and sprays all over the place, so really only good against big targets like SB/SBQ, and you end up needing to repair it every few cores 
---
People need to remember, youtubers are not much different than magazines now, they do it for the subs to get the moneyz.  Just play a game if it sucks, you out $60 if it doesn't then money well spent.  We all hate spending money on a shit game, and if it looks iffy, get it used from GameStop and return it if you don't like it.  End of the day games are a risk, like all things in life.
---
I play with a friend of mine, who has not played the game before. Started a new char with him and having a blast(except the bugs start to really appear when playing with a friend).
---
Sometimes I still log in with my main char to do some casual gear grinding and junk hoarding, but rarely, because I already have some good gear. 
---
I miss the missions and the world, and can't wait for some new content. 
---
Apply for creating a new law. 
---
"Videogame law: article 76. Section 1. Dupers will be prosecuted and banned".
---
Be serious.
---
New patch may fix a few bugs but the game is still broken. 
---
Game hangs on boot, can't team up with my friend.
---
Does Bethsada even test their games?  This is 
---
Fixing bugs is nice, but please fix the game .  
---
oh shit thanks!
---
Find a group doing a nuke, or find a server where a nuke is dropped. Turn yourself on pacifist and run around with explosive weapons. You only need to touch the enemies once to get the xp. Allow the beefy high levels to aggro and kill the mobs, but follow them around and touch each mob once. (If you're on PC this wont be quite as fast as console, since the patch went through.)
---
Also can do the same kind of thing, to a lesser extent, at the Watoga HighSchool, and a few other events in the game. Second the suggestions from those other commenters who mention WV Lumber Yard, and a few of those other areas.
---
I never server hop, just check every day or every DC...
---
I got mine after 10hours of actually looking lol.
---
Nothing? 
---
I don't mean this as a dig at all, but it seems like English may not be your first language based on your grammar.  Nothing wrong with that.  But perhaps if you think you are being misinterpreted that may have something to do with it?  Just because people disagree with you does not mean that there is a vast corporate conspiracy and we are all shills who shut down dissent.  That's absolutely disillusion and has no basis in reality.  But it's a very convenient way for you to internally rationalize to yourself that you're correct and we are all in on it shutting you down.  Maybe, just maybe... you're just flat out wrong?
---
All these people tried “beating” the game asap and they complained it was boring. As such, instead of bitchin and whining I decided to play differently. I NEVER fast travel anywhere and I just walk everywhere. It makes me go slowly through the game and take everything in so I don’t get bored fast. It’s way easier than getting onto a hate train with a destination to nowhere.
---
except trapper armor takes screws to make XD
---
I disagree this sub was full to the brim with people whining and saying the carry bug was ruining the servers.  We need to cater to the loudest people. 
---
The first step is admitting it
---
The refund button
---
Not quite Savage Divide, but I often set up just across the river from Helvetia. Pretty central, crashed airplane nearby, water, and only low level Scorched to bother you.
---
Read the title as "Make the sit and sleep beat anyone's price or your mattress is free"
---
I'm going back to bed
---
I haven't read up on the 45/50 stuff, but did Bethesda ever say why some things only go to 45? I mean, they could have shifted the stats for the items.. oh well
---
I certainly didn't want to but I was left with no choice. No one wanted to trade/had it so my only option was to server hop the only place it spawns naturally. If only there was a way to earn it by actually playing the game.
---
new “characters” you mean new pieces of paper and holotapes 
---
I play with a group, but we are wildly different levels and varying levels of progress through the story.  We have all found that the solo route is best since we play at differing paces, so we use the group as anchor points, and mostly do our own thing in the server.  We work on our own quests, adventuring essentially solo, but will call on each other for help when things get particularly difficult, or if we want to do an event/workshop together, but 90% of the time we’re in different corners of the map doing our own thing.  
---
I agree that this world is incredibly immersive, and if I was trying to keep pace with someone else, I feel like I’d miss a lot of that charm and nuance.  
---
When I looked it up the last post was about more than a month old. Also I wanted to know if there are any other caches like that. Didn't mean to make a useless post.
---
This is why I bought Fallout 76.
---
Yup! And good to add for those that don’t know.
---
There’s a luck perk that gives armour a chance at repairing itself upon being hit (can’t remember the name, sorry). Combining that with White Knight, I went from level 50 to level 70 without once having to repair or create new armour. You do need something like 6 perk points between the two perks, but it’s still really useful if you’re having armour troubles!
---
I believe furious caps at 80-90% whereas 2 shot is flat 100%
---
I agree. NMS was broken upon release on xbox. Many of the quest glitched when playing coop. Many of my saves/friends saves became corrupt after the game crashed. Fallout76 at least keeps our save files for the most part. Now NMS is getting a flurry of updates and is much more stable.
---
Started coming up a week ago, no
---
Read my first comment again. Its not rocket science.
---
Right i got down voted to hell  just to prove that. 
---
was your lunch your victim's junk?
---
Yea, no. I'm definitely a hoarder, but I've gotten use to the weight limit and am plenty able to manage it and get rid of shit, and I can imagine myself using 800 stash weight, but 1000 would be more than I think I could really use. 350-400 stash weight was only what could hold a reasonable amount of junk, and 600 allows you to carry that junk with a few extra items. Doesn't at all help that plenty of weapons weigh 25+ pounds. I have weapons in my stash that I could mod, but I simply refuse too as that would add 5 to 10 pounds on just one item. The only things I keep in my stash are junk, weapons, and armor. I couldn't imagine hitting 1500 stash weight with shit I actually use.
---
When it's explosive it's easy to tell, since the shots don't land on the exact same point. Since this guy didn't kill me with an explosive weapon I can't be 100% sure.
---
Each with their own luck, I know mines is far from the best. At least I got pretty much all the other T-60 mod plans that I know.
---
It is fun to look at but I don’t like the occasional damage I take and the accidental agro it causes.
---
I’m not sure exactly how they phrased it. I’m sure they developers knew they were going to have to fix bugs post release. Haha they had to have known the shape the game was in. It seems like the publishers are the bad guys here. BGS needs to clean house in some of their departments.
---
They’re my favorite game studio but as much as I actually like 76 and the potential it has they have really fucked up the PR and marketing of this thing.
---
if items were stored client side, sure, but all gear/items are stored server side exclusively, meaning that any time you reloged it'd need to be reset or would apply the name to the wrong thing if the names were client side as there wouldn't be a proper 'hook' to the server side info, and if that hook was there, then it could likely be exploited to let people 'edit' some weapon/item stats with the right strings used in the client side data
---
That’s a good question. I honestly don’t know! There could be a number of reasons, but everything I have is just wild speculation, sorry!
---
and it scales with 1% each shot?
---
They would make lots of points with me if they would just release a pip-boy app for fo76.   
---
Before you answer me about how it's impossible or gives you an unfair advantage, what if it's just a read-only pip boy or even something that is pip-boy-ish that just shows me my current stats. SOMETHING external to the game. 
---
Would have a long time ago? Game ain’t even out for a long time. Like not even 2 months?
---
maybe start new characters to experiement with new builds and items
---
it is technically an MMO and you can create classes.
---
Mmmmmmmm, I find this very easy to fap too. 
---
Quick question - are these plans, mods, or both?
---
GRA
---
Well I already know it will be and whatever other game they announced because they’ll be using this same almost 20 year old engine on both of them, I think if they just worked on getting a more updated engine a lot of their problems would be solved
---
I found my calibrated shocks for my exo after many hours...Yesterday i accidentally scrapped it... 
---
I just have so many extra perks i wanna stick on haha
---
Depends on the argument and if in fact the contract was break.
---
Again, tell me in the TOS where does it say that duping is an exploit? And how a judge would interpret it? 
---
Make laws about gaming and they will favor corporations. Thats what you want? Go for it.
---
The handmade fits into any rifle build, the lever action is always non-automatic, so only works for non-auto builds.
---
I get the feeling that his stash was full. Seems like a hoarder if he was carrying all that around.
---
If you're going to carry that much, at least spare 10 extra weight for a good set of pvp power armor. 
---
That the NPC would have to work differently?
---
"Oh just give all NPCs perks or some damage reduction equivalent"
---
No you don't have to at all, they don't have to work any differently. 
---
Any balance issues with NPCs and Monsters ALSO be a problem on the PvPvE servers.
---
and any fix applied to that server would be pushed to PvP and PvE servers.
---
The handmade will do less damage per shot, but it fires faster, and you can put an 85 bullet capacity drum magazine on it. You can kill a LOT more things without having to reload.
---
It weighs the same, not more, so no harm in doing it either. You get XP from the crafting of it, and there's not much else to do with plastic anyway. Only thing I don't bulk is plastic, because that's just stupid.
---
Personally I do it just so everything is in a more logical order and to make it easier to sell when I get over the 10/15 stack mark I use to know how much I want to keep. Unless they make everything sellable without bulking, there's no real harm in doing it.
---
Camden park sells a paddle ball (weapon) for tokens that you get from Camden park dailies :)
---
Nice
---
i thought the game should give you a notification to where or when a daily quest is available and you either choose to do it or ignore, this need to be fixed , can't afford to fast travel to a location that may or may not give a quest .
---
In a co conversation about banning people who have too many TSE weapons I gave you a relevent anecdote about why putting the limit as low as was suggested would be ridiculous and unfair. Whether or not what I've experienced is a typical case wasn't really the point. From what I have seen, between myself, my brother, and my xbox account, the rate at which I have been getting these drops is fairly consistent, but would see me banned u der the above user's suggestion. You have tried to argue against just about everything but what I was actually saying. I said I figure that's about average. In a normal conversation that is usually taken as "I have done nothing out of the ordinary and have no reason to believe I am a a statistical outlier." If you describe yourself as an average person do you research what typifies an average person in your region or country? Or do you just assume the person you're talking to will know what you mean?
---
I like big booms
---
Yes, you would enjoy Fallout 76 because the map on this game is the best of the series in my opinion. Variety is the name of the game and even revisiting certain locations is still exciting.
---
Yeah, imagine something like comparing one addiction to another, or drawing parallels between how suppliers keep consumers on the hook through certain practices. I mean smh they even compared loot boxes to gambling lmfao.
---

---
Explosive damage was affecting the 'explosive' legendary effect, until recently people were stacking bobble head effects to get damage numbers in the tens of, to hundreds of thousands range on these weapons
---
SK is WORSE than Hardened for the guns (including rifle) I’ve checked it on (just the simple math, it would be 1 less damage vs scorched than Hardened even without weird DR reductions).
---
Don't forget the disease you caught from your 3 second nap.
---
&gt; for the casuals and hardcore alike Fallout/TES and all of their merchandise probably makes them the most money
---
No, definitely not. They have their hands in dozens of IPs now, and i don't think the recent Fallouts or TES games have sold nearly as well as you seem to think they have 
---
That's not to say they sold poorly; they definitely sold well, they just didn't sell well enough to eclipse all the rest of their IPs together lol
---
The game deserves it. It really is a mishmash of different games all cobbled together, Bethesda themselves has said as much. They didn't have a clear objective or path for the game and it shows.
---
Yeah, I'm really enjoying the game so far.
---
Can't wait to see what they do in the future :)
---
There is a vast chasm of acceptable quality between 'perfect' and 'Fallout 76'.
---
Do you know where you got the recipe? The list of plans from one of the videos did not show them so it would be interesting if they did actually exist
---
This is exactly. 
---
Did you check to see if the headlamp on the mining helmet got brighter too?
---
So you are okay with your account being banned because you accidentally bought a dupped stimpacks or something? That's what they mean by "how far will they take this"
---
Good to know. Thank you.
---
Love it that your are content with the bare minimum!
---
I think you would love the world. It’s huge and fun to explore!
---
Tesla Rifle and Molotov Cocktails. Run in and tag them with either, then let the TSE dude at the front door bag them. You get XP and loot. 
---
It is at the beginning of a redemption story, now they just need to make good on the redemption part.

I am, admittedly, a bit of a character-making junkie. So a charter member of this choir am I, lol.
---
No fast travel is the way to go, well, as long as you aren't in a rush to be able to go hang with all the other *Whitespring-camping X-01-and-TSE-Meta folk*. My latest is a Guerilla build. Gun runner is hella fun, particularly for this stipulation. That % makes a large diff, my other chars feel like gaddam turtles now. Being early-game underpowered makes you approach things differently - I've gotten really proficient at kiting enemies into each other #goodtimes. 
---
Here's another fun stipulation. No Server Hopping. Some lvl499 hanging around Top-Of-The-World fuckin up your day? Tough. Deal with it. See #kiting above, lol. 
---
Just play the game. Why rush? 
---
Hardly an insufferable idealist to have certain standards of quality that are obviously above yours.
---
Paragraphs are your friend.
---
No clue but i know i can make only 2 drugs psychotats and climax or calm whatever it's called
---
Im 100 and havent beaten the main missions yet
---
Oh boy, someone doesn't understand the concept of this game lol
---
I believe it's explained by the Mariposa brotherhood managing to get in contact with a military official in the WV area, who is so enamored with the ideals of this new BoS that they create their own chapter, which unfortunately falls before it can meet up with the main body. 
---
Bored at work on a Friday my friend
---
The problem is the server wouldn't stay stable long enough to do anything. After a bit of browsing I see now it's a PS4 issue that is somehow linked to a prior "patch". Regardless it's very frustrating
---
God bless you and your charitable work.

Compound Bow...TWE
---
anyone who was a fan of both obsidian fallout games and bethesda fallout games knows the difference in experience.
---
obsidian is excellent for making the player feel like their choiced matter. obsidian makes role playing games.
---
bethesda is excellent for making a beautifully put together world. bethesda makes open world games.
---
fallout 76 puts this on display better than any previous bethesda game. 76 has the largest map of any fallout game, and the most beautiful. every region is just beautiful and brimming with things to explore. everywhere you go youre sure to see a story being told by the environment. (or, some programmers who decided to have some fun by strewing toys around, like a cat plushie fishing on the edge of a river, or a teddy bear playing poker with a corpse) 
---
the cranberry bog, though incredibly dangerous, is beautiful to look at. did you know theres also a tunnel that runs underground that protects you from scorchbeasts? i didnt. i explored it and its incredibly cool.
---
got to give love to the mire though. its dark, the monsters are angry, and it just gives off a feeling of dread so unshakeable. (they also purposefully made the yellow fungus that glows resemble the mothmans yellow eyes. also helps that the mire is where he spawns the most.)
---
fallout 76 has the best world of any fallout game. there is so much to explore and there is so much visual storytelling. i still am discovering new things every time i play.
---
Seriously? So much for saving space. Time to unbulk everything 
---
This is with all games. Using stealth in Ghost Recon Wildlands for instance. 
---
It's the fact that friends casual or not are too personal and won't necessarily "role-play". It's more about having fun than the stress of staying alive.
---
Roleplaying is easier alone because you're concocting stories and connecting the dots in your own head.

Funny thing is, the game is harder to find on sale now lol.
---
Along those lines, some of my favorite experiences have come from revisiting locations as a lone wanderer that I previously explored with friends.
---
I carry handmade automatic for trash mobs, and lever action for max damage. TSE plans for any weapon doesn't exist.

How many legs do you have?

Ok, not joking, I have full built excavator with my base everything and about a hour of running around(not 100% farming)

That would certainly explain things if true.

Technically they didn't lie about any of those things you've mentioned. You just admitted it. 
---
And yes so obviously greedy. I love it you hate it. You browse a sub for a game you hate, and I browse the same sub for a game I love.

Youre just so negative mate like why even show up here in the sub if you yell everything about tge game being all lies and made out of greed? Do you want the game to fail like most of the rabble, or do you browse still because deep down you want the game to succeed? Whats your issue? 
---
So my head-canon for this character is that I was a toddler when the Great War occurred and my parents were not on the list for vault entrance but a woman who was agreed to say I was her son and I gained vault entrance while my parents perished in the radiation baked Appalachia. My 25 years spent in the vault were fraught with discipline issues as I chaffed under the harsh rules and strict authoritarian style of vault-tec managed life. When Reclamation Day finally rolled around, I relished the idea of a life free from structure and dictatorial rule where I could unleash myself like a caged animal that just wants to return to the wild.
---
TLDR: my character is kinda a vicious sociopath loner.
---
Thanks for asking!
---
You know well that duping is an exploit as it isn’t an intended function of the game and requires you to crash your own game to make it happen. In fact since you’re defending it so much I’m going to assume you’re one of the duper’s and do not wish to be banned.
---
Not off hand, I'm hoping Bethesda create a mothman mask players can use instead of the skull one.
---
You could adopt a more ork/khorne view, they care not what you wear as long as the blood flows and skull dedicated in their name 
---
Adhesive limits this.
---
I figured that combo would be good but never imagined that good. Thanks for letting me know, in the game info about perks like this is the best!
---
Is there a TSE 2/3 star lever?
---
I have it come on by
---
Yes, but a very small amount, best best is hard bargain rank 3 and grape mentats 
---
Blocker is really good.
---
RadScorpions are very damgerous. They apply a poison that kills me occasionally.
---
I find them more dangerous than the queen
---
Right?! Sometimes all I do is log on, sort my inventory, eat some food, sell excess to a nearby train station, sort my inventory and log! Another hour long play session in the books. See you in a couple days. 
---
They almost don't drop fusion cores anymore after of the previous patches.
---
Lol nadier 
---
Pistols in both hands(not really a weapon, but thought this may fit here).
---
I agree! We need something that signifies another player in need of help. Like an emergency flare. You shoot it, and your dot on the map becomes a different colour.. players will see that and come to your aid. I love helping players out as much as I can, and this should make it easier
---
Hm, I have an extra PC I use to access my mule. How are you able to log into the launcher with two accounts at the same time? Do you have two launchers open? VM? 
---
I'm totally down with that. And I can appreciate "stream-of-consciousness" posting. I just know that it's easier to follow if you add in line breaks at appropriate places, that's all. Heck, I upvoted your post. I just wish it was more conducive to reading.
---
Yeah! And let’s throw $60 at them and have the game drop to $30 in a month!
---
but there are only so many vendors with their own cap pool.
---
They exist, yes.
---
Also, there is a unpublished weight glitch still that people can use to carry thousands of pounds. You can tell who they are because the game crawls standing near them. Good news is it gets patched out Monday. 
---
My friend got a TSE Gatling gun from a Mirelurk attacking her back porch yesterday morning.
---
...I have an Instigating fire axe...
---
Lonevaultwanderer streams, he's fun to watch or play with. 
---
I remember you! Your the kid that thought putting poop in peoples shoes was funny! 
---
You ruined my best slippers! I’m going to hunt you down and make you pay!!
---
I'm on PC and its butter smooth 4k with ultra settings since patch. I was getting some hitching but its gone now. 
---
I carry beer and grape mentats and any armor with + Char on it on my daily vendor runs.
---
There are enough vendors I promise. If you go and empty all of them is 1000-1200 caps every ~24 hours. 
---
It’s not chem/disease related? 
---
More stuff related to the Cult in general would be quite fun (quests, weapons, armor, etc). 
---
I will look into it, thanks!
---
These guys got it all. I will mention that when I was trying to farm for mutations the first time I had a really hard time popping my second one. It ends out I had taken a radaway at some point before the first one and that made it really hard to get a second one. Take a look at your status effects page for some Clues.
---
I've only had it happen once and I'm suspicious it was related to duping (pissed and bored about their spot being taken? Falsely thinking *I'm* a duper?). Still paranoid about it though.
---
At the rate they are patching this game, using and maintaining mods sounds like a huge hassle to me. On PC, also waiting for patches instead of modding. 
---
I’ve got twisted muscles bloodied grognaks with radicool and other stuff buffing my strength up to like 23 at low health is the highest I ever got it (not many unyielding pieces) and highest it ever got was like 500-600 I’m missing a couple slugger cards but I have most of them I can’t believe can’t believe can’t believe it gets so much higher still 
---
Hmmm...that not that bad. 10 shots and damage is basically up. Minigun comes with 200 ammo per reload, might do ~20% less damage than two shot, but that is still ~80% damage bonus. Basically 2nd best primary effect to have, it seems.
---
Uhhh, most games are not cross-platform when it comes to multiplayer. Being cross-platform is in fact, very much *not* the norm. Very rarely do you see cross-platform online play in xbox/ps games, let alone for MMOs. I think you are confusing the fact that these games "exist" cross-platform with the fact that their multiplayer servers have nothing to do with each other.
---
park it behind the clubhouse at whitesprings with 10 turrets on top, you'll know for sure then.  
---
I'll be waiting pops... ;-)
---
LOL! I love logging in to realize you were not in power armor at the Whitespring and a Nuke is inbound.
---
I thought I had enough .308 ammo to last me a lifetime (had about 3000) and when going through the tunnel  between the Bog and the Ash Pit I burned through 800 rounds of my Light Machine Gun fighting these low level scorched with all the heavy weapons perk on. Traveling light is all well and good if you're a stealth sniper build like 90% of the game, but if you want to use almost anything else you're shit out of luck.
---
That's exactly what was happening. This level 190 was leading our group and Everytime I even got within 100 feet of the guy I hit 1 frame and had to restart the game.   Not to mention dude was literally sliding around like he was on roller skates and had no animation to his gun or power armor.
---
haha yeah, the 'special' Olympics 
---
Which vendor pools? I only know of Grahm, White Springs, and the Railroad Vendors. Are there more or are the railroad vendors sub-divided into more?
---
Seen him once already, first try since patch.
---
Agreed - Jon @ ManyATrueNerd - absolute gold. Take a look at his older "Fallout" stuff as well if you'd like a treat!
---
I loved those floors. Those kind of stairs would be so great with the small camp sizes we have. 
---
Slightly.
---
Grape mentats and hard bargain change then alot.
---
Each cha pt is 1.5% iirc. 
---
In my defense, that's a typo, not ignorance, but yes.
---
**Italic intensifies**
---
Thanks for all the replies, it seems like this is something that people have been experiencing. After sleeping it off a bit, I’m marginally less heartbroken by my sweet loss of pixels. Still sucks and frustrating though, now that I’ve tasted the nectar, I need it again! 
---
I guess I’ll just cross my fingers and hope I find another one. 
---
People like to shit on games that aren't 100% what they expected. Any Warhammer 40k fans will know Eternal Crusade, a really fun multiplayer shooter that was *killed* in reviews. 
---
IMO too much clout is given to "reviewers" online. It's helpful if you're on the fence about a game, but there's such a cult of personality around individuals that it's crazy. 
---
You wanted multiplayer Fallout - here they are
---
&gt; so in about a year
---
Utterly ridiculous rationalization
---
The implication is PvP will be as balanced as PvPvE lets it be.
---
ANY fix which you would be able to apply to the current servers could be applied to the PvP servers.
---
I mean, the current state isn't balanced, BUT, the same changes you would make to MAKE it balanced on the PvP servers, would ALSO be applied to the PvE servers.
---
I was level 128 before I ever saw the mothman.  I load into the game, go in my house for a bit, hop on outside to grab some crops and BOOM he's on a cliff overlooking my house just staring at me!
---
Pull out the gun and start going to town, he was a lot tougher than I thought he'd be.  Didn't drop anything good.  But the encounter was interesting.
---
That's perfect. I'd love if it were an actual quest in game. 
---
I'm on the hunt for ANY TSE, since I only have the base guns.  Personally, I keep my lever gun for stealth kills, and long distance hits It usually takes a very large chunk off the health bars. My handmade is great for flying enemies (scorchbeasts, cargo bots) and for anything moving quickly that I want to pummel with bullets. 
---
Why don't they make it upgrade-able? It solves and adds more things for the players to do.
---
I have stopped playing FO76 as of today, I had been enjoying it but the straw that breaks the camels back landed... Well... On my back today 😂
---
Anyway, I made a short YouTube video of why, and info in the description 
---
https://youtu.be/yz0epv0BjO8
---
it doesn't have to be anything complex like that. the client can get all unique IDs from the server and change the name appropriately; it just needs to be a one-way transaction (i.e. not from client to server).
---
the names also don't have to be persistent, and even if you wanted to, caching such information client side should be enough.
---
Definitely not forgotten about it I just quit playing because of it. Well, that and the fact I have 70 pounds of phantom weight on my character after I drop everything meaning I have even less carrying capacity. 
---
My brother and I play online together. Whenever we tried to do the same quest I end up waiting one checkpoint ahead of him for half an hour at EVERY single checkpoint. It drove me nuts lol. I ended up just beating the game and now I follow him around while he takes his time. If he starts reading a terminal I just travel to an event and come back when he's done. Groups seem to work much better when you're just following one person's quest imo
---
I've never had to run that far, I run to the electrical pole that is leaning against the bridge and turn around and they're there. Been doing it for a month. I've only gotten the responder bought once and he did not have the hunters long coat.
---
Then last night we were talking about that vendor and one of my friends says oh I've got that coat. I'm not wearing it anymore do you want it? And he gave it to me.
---
You should try teaming up it's almost an entirely new game at that point. Me and my friends give each other side quest sometimes when were helping them find something or support them for a mission. 
---
I've played 200 hours completely solo so far. Having a wonderful time. 
---
Thanks bud!
---
You can thank them enough.  You already did.  You paid them for a product and they are, slowly, providing the product.
---
I'm just glad I got the game for free on my insane xbox one x bundle. 4 games and one x for £400.
---
Hopefully they will improve it, as its pretty lacking from what I've played. No one likes a brown nose op 
---
Fingers crossed. 
---
I'm still playing because I'm still having fun.
---
 My first character was a pure support build. I got him to the 70s and had a blast doing it. Met a good crew along the way. 
---
Now I play an unarmed build. The previously mentioned crew, and I, have shifted into more pvp focused gameplay.
---
We've taken up the raider flag and are having a blast picking fights across Appalachia. 
---
Absolutely, if I breach the terms of service by (for example, but not limited to) duping I should get banned, no argument.  But your nose must be broken as I don't, so I won't. 
---
My interest is in consumer attitudes to product quality, these posts are extremely helpful to understand the broad church of beliefs and opinion.
---
but dont u then have liek 1 hp because of all the radiation u took?
---
Everyone's a badass till that roach takes flight.
---
i'm usually not short on screws though
---
I managed to load 7 shots in one go on my two shot the dragon once. It shot stupid fast but once it ran out, it would only take one at a time.
---
Keep in mind that you need a way to know that you are not just being put back in the same server when you try to hop. I've seen people talk about dropping an item inside of a Box nearby or collecting all of the wood from a pile and then seeing whether it is collected when you go back. You can also take a look at names near you on the map. I've had it put me in the same map multiple times when trying to avoid somebody on my friends list.
---
Sorry about that, after lunch I’ll try to break it up more for you
---
Its LT on xbox. You can also lock water purifiers and resource generarators. 
---
Always wondered that myself, I only have 5 luck. However I've heard people find jet packs easy with 2 luck, now only to guess if they are being honest?
---
Yeah, I know that feeling. 
---
I have a friend who runs a pyrolizer build, which is incredibly resource intensive. He spends most of his time farming for minimal amounts of combat. The crashes were particularly disheartening for him, and he plays very little these days from what I gather. 
---
But when you mainly use them for a bit of PvP, with steel farming as a secondary perk, the good outweighs the bad. 
---
Either way, here’s hoping they can iron crashes out eventually. 
---
No they should have tried to release it like this in the first place.
---
Take his eggs that's when I found him
---
I might start using grenades again
---
Here’s my question.  My build is gonna have I corporate usage of overdrive.  +15% damage, but the bigger thing is it gives a 25% chance to crit on any attack, not just vats.  Do any crit damage boosting effects apply to overdrive crits?
---
Im discussing this on another thread. 
---
Terms like duping are not recognized by law. Prove that duping is an exploit instead of a game bug (hence Bethesdas responsibility) would be hard on court.
---
Does someone know the maximum selling price for purified water? (Thanks for answers) 
---
I think Zealots is just scorched. The prime reciever is for scorchbeasts plus scorched. 
---
Why not pump action?
---
Did you get that mutation by dying to rads?
---
That bugs them out. Only way to fix it is to clear that mutation.
---
It depends per weapon. Furious is great for faster firing ones, but instigating is better for one shot rifles/shotguns in most cases. That's why I don't like two shot, it's just objectively better without any strategy or skill involved. No subtlety, no restrictions, just better. There is a recoil and spread increase, but there are very few weapons where that's relevant
---
I have a lvl 45 3 star TSE lever action. Has +40% movement while scoped and that includes things like reflex and glow sights. I never use vats with it
---
Good, not only gets rid of those abusing but also may scare joe s’mo to do it too 
---
Lets thank them !
---
A rushed game is forever bad and a delayed game has the potential to be good , I’ll buy this game in like a year or so when it’s on sale and is in the state it should have been at launch. 
---
&gt;Listen to yourself!
---
Turnabout is fair play.
---
&gt;God damn it's painful to deal with entitled gamers.
---
&gt;Go outside and experience the real world
---
&gt;Every now and then you'll get some uppity shithead
---
And let's just go back to the bare bones of your provably low standards:
---
'If it has Fallout in the name I will buy it.' A publisher's dream cash cow.
---
Edgy.
---
# Make Snipers Great Again
---
Heck we got oblivion lock picking!
---
The dude getting downvoted is correct. Despite have "Scorch" in their names, scorchbeasts don't actually count as "scorched enemies."
---
Ty, been wondering this for a while now
---
Don’t remember I may have but I don’t remember 
---
That’s exactly what I was picturing. Everyone turning into hermits &amp; hiding in 1x1 huts while the sound of turret engines frowns out their thoughts 😂
---
Hahahahahaha, thats friggen great.
---
Also, I fuggin love Breaking Bad!!!
---
This applies to people not to a faceless triple A company that already pocketed your money.
---
Yeah I'm not gonna read all that horse shit. Quit sucking Bethesda dick.
---
Did you actually get a hardened .50 plan?  If so, please show us the result.
---
&gt;Todd Coward
---
So edgy lmao 
---
So let's nuke it.
---
simple enough :D but i guess not without Perks. or? how do i get rid of radiation after taking mutation?
---
Duping=Duplication which is a recognized term. An exploit is something used to ones advantage. It was a bug but once people decided to use it to their advantage or give themselves an unfair advantage over other players it’s considered an exploit.
---
Just out of curiousity, can they run on Mac OSX or would I need to install something like bootcamp/parallels. 
---
I am fine with temp bans for expolits that aren't fixed, but it should never be perma for something you use 0 3rd party programs to get into 
---
He's not trying to say you made a useless posy man.
---
He's trying to say Bethesda is dropping the ball.
---
idk. Problems in this game are far worse than eso had at launch. A lot of the issue I personally have stem from a ton of functions really unfinished and horrid designs.
---
thats why the patch came out early for pc. pc players find the weird bugs and console playerd gets a better version of the patch
---
Do those TOS "protections" conspire to allow less good quality product to be released in the first place ?
---
Imagine if those protections were not available, would a publisher invest more in QA to release higher quality product, avoiding most of the PR sh1t storm ?
---
Rest In Peace, you violent mechanical merchant deathbringer... 
---
The are all over the place. I'm constantly getting them. 
---
I know and you know. But according to law,  duping as a legal term does not exist. Proving that it is an exploit instead of a bug (hence bethesdas responsibility) would be very difficult. Prove to a court that you're prohibiting a paying costumer from playing the game due to an activity that you cant really prove its an exploit.... i dont know, it would be hard.
---
What do they count as? Animals?
---
Definitely an “opt-in” system would be needed because always on would get exhausting after a while. 
---
Having the choice to pvp on or off on the main menu before loading in would have to be implemented.
---
also note healing factor only works when out of combat
---
It’s ok so crying over spilled milk does what? We all agree it should have launched better but it didn’t so now what? You either play it or don’t 
---
I think what I am looking or is a TSE handmade .45 that obvi has explosive/additional projectile because I like the power when it comes to scorchbeasts and big mobs, and I like the power my TSE lever has but I need more than 5 rounds and some other options would be nice as well.
---
I chase people around with a flaming chainsaw while wearing a creepy mask and clown suit.  That's one of the things I still enjoy doing.  It's a lot of fun watching the various reactions it'll get.
---
Other than that, it's the people I've met.  All of us older men, enjoying doing events, nuking various places, killing the SBQ, sharing loot with whoever can use it best.  All in all, just a good time with friends.
---
F
---
That's actually hidden server messages being displayed. If you look you never actually lose ammo when this happens, it's just whatever amount of ammo you used in your last engagement.
---
Should look a bit better for you, I’ll do some quality assurance when I’m not in a parking lot
---
As of the Jan 10th patch, no changes.
---
I don't even bother with workshops as low levels in the know just take it melting my T60 one shot, every time. It's a joke so I ignore that part of the game otherwise I get too frustrated and rage quit.
---
All plans,  didn't bother to write down mods. Only helmet mods (excluding targeting HUD) weren't found as plans but only mods. The only other plan that I believe doesn't exist is optimized bracers, I think I've seen it a few times as mods for T-45 and T-51b but I'm not as 100% sure as my list is.
---
You got my vote!
---
You’re part of the problem.
---
At first I was hesitant bc we basically have then entire state and figured adding in an extra city to the map would be odd, but looking at a [map](http://pics2.city-data.com/city/maps/fr652.png) it's on the very edge of the state, so a small expansion to the west seems much more plausible.
---
They have to fix the dupes issue thoroughly before they can allow organic growth of in game storage.
---
That's fine if the system was even a little balanced, but it is not.
---
The Deliverer. 
---
I want my pretty lil Bond pistol back.. 
---
Geez, he scares the poopers out of me when he does that.
---
Yeah no matter what it just doesn’t work I’ll try to get rid of it and get it back
---
That's awesome, grats!!
---
For a stealth sniper vats build, oh hell yes. Better vats accuracy (perception), more AP and better stealth (agi), faster crit gain and better loot condition (luck), and you are hiding in stealth all the time so who cares about low health?
---
I agree with you.  But given that this is a product whose ultimate goal is to make money, action will be taken when the bottom line is being affected.
---
That's why many people continue to say, "vote with your dollars," and "never preorder".
---
How would expansions work? They would expand the map or create a different area? 
---
Same here brah.
---
No, I haven't seen it drop yet but I think they simply have forgotten about it just like the legendary hunting rifle itself. There should either be a .50 cal hardened receiver or just a .50 prime receiver (which acts as hardened + more scorched damage).
---
Have it so anyone can be murdered anywhere at any time.
---
Do you happen to have a Western Revolver with +50% VATS crit damage?
---
High int makes the base item condition better, that is all. 
---
The Overrepair perks for armor will increase the Armor’s damage resistance (NOT energy, just physical) by a percentage of the overrepair, that will drop as the armor degrades. 
---
(This is also true of melee weapon over repair)
---
In this instance I'll defer to the municipal bylaw restricting smoking within ten metres of a public entrance, window or air inlet.
---
So yeah smoke in the Mire all you like.
---
Oooh, look at Mr Fancypants over here with his water textures.
---
But seriously, I don't have any. And there's been no fix.
---
I agree with you man, big ups on this post g
---
We know. But exploit would be if i get a personal advantage over other players. But since its acessible to everyone, how can you prove its an exploit and not a bug?
---
We can keep going in circles about this all I know is, it’s cheating which is against the TOS we all signed giving zenimax the right to terminate your account for doing so. It’s their game so they can choose what is an exploit anyways.
---
So we get down to it, you think I duped my weapons. You've based your average on your experiences and you want me to lose my stuff because of that single data point. Makes sense.
---
It depends on how much the youtuber makes as to whether or not it'd be worth their time or not. 
---
Start an adhesive farm
---
I've only encountered him randomly when I'm alone (aside from the lighthouse event who seems much friendlier) 
---
If Bethesda does a big banwave trust me, they will make sure to tell us. It wont be a secret thing that they dont mention. Also if there is a banwave lots and lots of people will come here crying about how they were falsely banned, etc... Or that they "didnt dupe but only picked up a dropped dupers inventory" and so forth.
---
Your over exaggerating and it does not help your argument 
---
No, I don't. There is no "top" in this game. There isn't even a leader board. You seem to be upset about other people who may have better things than you.  
---
Oh! I know but being encumbered is being encumbered!
---
Yeah, let us hope that they see the negative press as a wake up call.  
---
That would be awesome dude, I don’t really know how to level up fast or get loads of food and water 
---
Looks great. Thank you!
---
There was a steamer trunk all the way in the back
---
What’s you’re PSN Name?
---
I just got done explaining it to another person I’m not explaining it again. It’s zenimax’s game, he holder of the contract, they can choose what is and isn’t an intended function of their game and consider it an exploit or bug.
---
“You ready to die for your country you commie bastard”
---
it wont go well...
---
I got a legendary Anti-armor last night. Then got disco'd within seconds and it wasn't 'saved'. \*shrug\* But it was a hunting rifle, so yeah they're dropping.
---
Look, if the banned player go to court because its unprovable that duping is an exploit, then we'll talk.
---
Umm no? They are arguing it shouldn't be fixed they just refuse to outright say it.
---
Same as here. I can't find you for some reason.
---
No just a bloodied single action 
---
I go 200 over sometimes grabbing lead weights so I don't know.
---
Same. 
---
If you're on XB1 ive got a TSE handmade
---
They should add something to the game to make it easier to swap out perk sets, or make some perks passive abilities.  If you're on PC, you can use [this](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124) to swap perk sets; I've used it for a while now and find it indispensable.  No luck for our console brethren, though.
---
I barely killed anyone recently!
---
I've played since beta never seen this event work
---
Basically lets them do whatever they want, at the peril of being trumped by some countries consumer laws that do nothing beyond (at best) giving you your money back. What constitutes an exploit is their interpretative perogative, not yours.
---
It's to the east of Watoga called the Flooded Train yard. 
---
Here's a map with it highlighted: http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Flooded_trainyard
---
Tagging is actually not as simple as hitting it once. You have to do a certain percentage of its health. Not sure how much, maybe as low as 1-2%, but SB have a lot of health and resistance, you need more than 1 .38 to tag them. 
---
Now THAT is some engaging game play right there! How wonderful it must have felt to accomplish such a challenge! /s
---
Damn. Thanks anyway tho!
---
A permaban would be very harsh for something like a carry way exploit use, you're right. But I don't think a couple days to a week ban would be terrible. Especially for someone who's showing others how to use the exploit and not just doing it for their own game enhancement (if you will, probably not the best phrase).
---
This happened with my medics dragon. It was awesome until it broke. I was mowing down scorchbeasts at prime. Unfortunately it didn't happen until after we took out the queen.
---
honestly i'm not that mad of daily bugs in the game but you know whats annoying?  
---
The Loading screen ...u need to press space way to many times to skip the intro and then wait ..  
---
and press any key and wait ..  
---
and then game menu shows need to wait ..  
---
for friend list..  like damn that takes for ever   
---
 and even after u load and start moving around few seconds .. like a dream it never happened
---
back right where u just respawn again 
---
sometimes its funny .
---
This never seems to work though. Look at no Mans sky or Battlefront II. They are still going, but they lost millions and millions when compared to a game like RDR2. 
---
yes, definitely
---
You sir gave me a idea. Time to make a corn maze
---
If I leave my door unlocked at night, is it my fault if someone comes and and steals my TV? 
---
Take some responsibility for your own actions, people!
---
Its actually really good if you manage to get it at 50. Same amount of flame damage, but base damage is increased. Im actually quite pleased with it. I originally had it at 35, but lucked out by someone else good graces to get it at 50, and its respectably viable. Also really good for tagging and damaging the Queen, believe it or not. Its not the initial damage, but resonding damage. Each shot + the 3 seconds of damage.
---
What’s you’re name? I’ll try to add you 
---
Does it work that way?
---
Seems like if it did, it would be wise to research Quest Rewards and only pop them when at an appropriate level.
---
I built a treehouse over this waterfall that I was really happy with. https://youtu.be/K-7g9icxWRk

Yeah I'm convinced to go with unyielding for the fun bonuses, I'm going to run nerd rage, dodgey, and serendipity perks to help keep me alive if I get in a tight spot 😁
---
I've met 3 regular Stalking and 1 Vengeful Mothman through simply cruising around the north of The Forest and south of Mothman Museum. I was just mining Ore and walking around. They just appear... I love them. Such cool creatures. 
---
Dew it I wanna see it 
---
Oh come on dude, it’s an exploit of the game systems period. Trying to say we need some court say in this is just trying to be a smart ass to justify people doing something with intent to outplay the system. 
---
Crush the infidel Youtubers. Deus vult.
---
There’s power patcher for power armor, and white knight for regular, in intelligence and agility respectively.  Both reduce the repair cost....but both also reduce the durability loss from attacks, power patcher maxing at 60% durability loss reduction, and white knight at 90%.  There’s also a luck perk that can give I believe just regular armor a chance to gain durability instead of lose it when attacked.  All very useful.
---
It is their fault, and it’s industry standard, nothing new. It’s in the TOS which states that if you find any exploit and glitches you should report it and not abuse it or face consequences. This TOS is similar to all video games, especially online video games. Once you buy the game and start playing it you’ve already agreed to the TOS.
---
I would assume "creatures" like deathclaws, but I don't know for sure Like I said in a another comment, I tested a Zealot's Combat Shotgun vs a "regular" shotgun with identical mods, and the Zealot gun didn't seem to do any more damage to an SB than my regular gun.
---
No, it’s not one tap. It’s a % of health. Most mobs have low enough health and most players do enough damage that 1 tap exceeded that threshold, but not always, SB being a case. 
---
My guess is it’s between 1-3% of health. 
---
Good. These people ruined the trading economy.
---
all the dupers, and anybody running around with two shot explosive shot guns should be banned permanently. Those people knew where their items were coming from when they paid $10 for them.
---
can't get a single shot off on glowing ones in White springs, thanks to everybody running around with that damn gun.
---
I have had several pop-up addictions appear occasionally and I'm assuming they are passive because they aren't listed under effects. I may pop an Addictol when I get back on and see if that does anything and I've been under their effects without knowing it...
---
See I don't know about this. In fallout 4 I though everyplace told a story but I lot of places in 76 seem barren. 
---
Emil_Zatopek1982
---
Precisely. If we're going on circles, imagine what lawyers can do.
---
Just because theres a TOS saying that they can ban you due to exploits, doesnt mean i cant defend myself against it.
---
All in all, i just think that banning is excessive and there are plenty of means to punish exploiters. 
---
Cheers
---
I just waited to buy it. Works great!
---
I've duped a really lackluster item by being rolled back. Gave it to the girlfriend as she plays a 1H build shortly after I crashed and was rolled back. 
---
Now I dont have excessive copies of anything, and never intended to dupe but I will bet if mass bans did happen. Dupers would be trying to gain sympathy saying they innocently duped an item. 
---
Soo... ban people for trading. Because I'm better there's a lot of folks out there unaware that they got suckered in a trade by a duper. 
---
Good, fuck em.
---
There is no 'blind hate' here.  You had an opinion.  People disagreed with it.  That's it.  They proposed their opinions that are contrary to your own, and there seems to be overwhelming unanimous agreement that your stance is not correct.  I didn't insult you, I'm simply pointing out the fallacy in your rebuttals.  It seems you have a persecution complex and this discussion is no longer focused on the original topic but instead on whether or not you are being bullied by the perceived conspiratorial majority so this will be my last response.  In closing, a contrary opinion =\= valid by the sheer virtue that it is opposite of the majority.  You can be contrary, and also 100% wrong.  Which you are.  I will not be responding to you again, have a nice day internet stranger.
---
PS4...ugh.
---
Lets not also forget that in the sake of 'balance' all that mattered was DPS when they did fire rates/damage per shot

Still waiting for something to be done about PvP. As it stands now, people can just hit you with a stick until you shoot them and then you die.
---
I've had two encounters.
---
The first was around level 20 and i came across a red eyed mothman stuck in a rock near the sniper shack north of vault 76. I just stood back and shot him for 5 minutes before he died, never moved or attacked. 
---
The second time was a couple days ago at level 47. i just fast traveled to my camp (near the bee icon on the map in the savage divide) and a yellow eyed mothman showed up and proceeded to kick my ass all over the place. i took him down but he was a pretty tough fight and packs one hell of a punch. 
---
That is crazy that the difference would be so huge... BoS Heavy Combat doesn't have legendary effects though I take it?
---
Crit damage varies by weapon and comes in the form of a fixed amount.
---
Yup. Ban them all. I saw some guy with 1000 dirty water. ***THAT DUPER NEEDS TO BE BANNED***
---
Yeah, no thanks. They didn’t try when they should have tried the hardest. I played this game up until about a month ago, completed story, got to lvl 130ish, did all the content, and was bored and pissed off at all the bugs a couple weeks in. 
---
They really let me down and I’ve been a Bethesda fanboy for a very long time. So while they may be trying now it’s a bit too late for many people that couldn’t stick around long enough to see it. 
---
Even if they don't log a timestamp when an item was looted, they can still see 1 million of something currently in an inventory.  The game's only been live a few months.
---
I'm open to the idea that it doesn't work, but I'd need more than this. SB health from shotty hits will be all over the place because of the whole damage/number of pellets vs targets with 300 armour.
---
It does, but none of the quest rewards are good enough to bother with that, this item included.
---
No worries, check back as farming is all there is to do lol
---
Paint ball gun, I want to paint every target pink so you know I could of killed you but chose not too.
---
Yes, this is something that needs fixing, but that will come with time.
---
Quantico is in VA… maybe they found a passenger Cargobot? 🤪
---
And let's not forget about Munitions Factory. That place is the home of all my nightmares.
---
If you actually manage to beat Bethesda in court where they have all the money in the world to get the best lawyers then I’ll tip my metaphorical hat to you and admit defeat, till then, good luck in the wastes. I’ll admit I enjoyed this debate.
---
Yeah, I learned this way too late as well. It's very helpful.
---
Started an alt and they had an almost working soccer field in there. That's what we need. Get Destiny 1 back here
---
Thats not how it works in courts. 
---
I just posted this before I saw your comment, lol.
---
Lead and aluminum, I think. Also acid because you got 15 acid from bulk acid but it only takes 10 to make bulk acid. But they're fixing the acid thing this patch. 
---
Random generated quest from cryptos woild be cool specially all spy like it woild be awsome lol
---
Oh thanks! I've heard of this just haven't been there. Iirc some rare underarmor plans spawn there. I'll have to check it out! Thanks again for the reply!
---
Ditto. It's pretty much my main "all round" weapon for normal stealth play. Think about it. Headshot with Instigating and the rifleman perks + bloody mess + fully ranked covert operative will do some serious damage to *most* things out there. 
---
I miss the highlighting from Scrapper in FO4.  :(
---
Had my base outside there growing mutfruit to combine with the corn and tatos there for adhesive. Can confirm high level muties all around and many legendaries. The shed spawns t-51 fairly regularly. The river is right beside and it’s halfway between Watoga and Harper’s. Great location, I haven’t moved from there for weeks. Apart from when I tried to put my base on top of the monorail but that didn’t work. 
---
i did not know this! i thought you could survive the initial blast as long as you were in PA. TIL!
---
I made a mistake! I made a mistake!
---
::quickly jumps servers::
---
I have heard that the same generator can drop and it could take several tries to get it to drop, not sure how true that is though.
---
That's fair, but to expand a bit, I only used the shotguns once I got the beast on the ground, so it was pretty much point blank range. We need to have this guy test his hunting rifle against an identical one and see what happens.
---
Because it's not on the servers - it's on every client, i.e. every copy of the game. Can easily be found by looking through the game data files, along with a shitload more 'dev' and 'test' rooms.
---
I had 5-6 hangs since the last PC patch, mostly when I tried to consume some food/drink from my inventory. (It was especially annoying as I play in lower resolution than my desktop and alt-tabbing doesn't let me switch to the process manager to kill Fallout76.exe. I had to log out of Windows so it kills the game.)
---
Before the patch, I had CTDs when the game's memory usage peeked (With 16 GB RAM, FO76 goes up to 13GB usage).
---
.45 SMG, anti-material rifle, rotary grenade launcher, Tesla cannon, laser rcw, single-shot 45-70 pistol. 
---
There’s no reason to hoard that much junk though? Once you have your camp set up and the right perks so repairing/crafting doesn’t cost as much, you only need a little bit at a time.
---
the information is just relaying a name. the information would literally just be a string - you could even encrypt it. i don't see how it would create a vulnerability.
---
What they really needed was an actual BETA. For those of us who participated in that, myself included, the community found bugs and serious design issues that could have been patched before going into full release. 
---
I remember thinking to myself that the developers likely never had the time to actually play their game, otherwise they would have noticed things like mods getting scrapped, scorchbeasts suck, weapon weights are way out of wack, stash boxes weren’t good enough, camp building issues, painful ness of armor repairs, etc.
---
If there’s one thing we can agree on, it’s that the community has been patching/modding every Bethesda game since Morrowind. We all knew this game would have issues going into the BETA. But the sheer shitshow of the BETA was inexcusable considering it was truly just a play early time frame. 
---
Its not trying to be smart. Its the legal system. You cant ban a paying costumer just because you want, you need to prove harm done. And proving that duping is an exploit and not a bug would be hard.
---
Exploit would mean i have advantage over other players. But if duping is acessible to everyone how is that exploiting.
---
Im legit curious on how this would play on court.
---
I'm at a little over 200 hours and I think about 95% of that has been solo, but my bf and other friends play when they can and I've enjoyed the ability to group up with them. By now I'm about a hundred levels higher than the next highest player in our circle but that doesn't seem to matter, and having 9 charisma helps bring them anywhere I might want to take them
---
H:  TSE paddle balls. W:  a new direction in life.   
---
Get'um while their hot,  these prices are so crazy low i must have ants in my eyes! 
---
I dont believe this is true I havent had any issue when near people who have junked up themselves or storage with 1000s of items.  I have had issues when first loading into the game or when entering an area where mobs are about to spawn.  The game is not well tuned no way to know for sure what is causing server issues dupers are just the scapegoat of the day before that it was people using the weight glitch.  Perhaps its just not a perfect game and still needs to be fixed.
---
You'll know he's perving on you when you hear the distinct sound of wings flapping. Starts faint sure enough, but then it gets louder &amp; louder.
---
Then you see the eyes....
---
Though frankly even when one jumped me about level 20 near ash heap, wasn't that tough. I may not have had any grenades left, but not that tough. 
---
I had issues with the weight limit I went through and looked at what I needed and what I didn't.  I'm a sniper build and I can't understand why people are complaining about rifle weight.  I have 5 rifles each a different ammo type (15 lbs each, roughly 75 lbs).  I carry 2 and a melee weapon at any given time.  I don't know why anyone would "need" to store more than that.  
---
The much bigger headache for me is the food/water mechanic.  I like the mechanic but it is way over burdensome.  I haven't done the math but you need to drink 40+ lbs of water per day in order to not be dehydrated.  Wut.  Kill a dear to get 1.5 lbs of salvageable meat.  Wut.  Said meat prevents you from starving to death for about 5 mins. Wut.  The mechanic is not realistic at all, just a perpetual chore.  I've learned to deal with it, but still it's awful.
---
Super capitalist. 
---
1. Obtain item for zero money/effort.
---
2. Find gullible sap with money.
---
3. Sell item to gullible sap.
---
4. Pure Profit.
---
This.  Available from level 1 and have one spawn on the corpse outside the vault.
---
came her to say That Gun. it's been my favorite gun since my first FO1 run through 20 years ago!
---
Thanks for the info man 
---
There’s also plenty of false bravado on the part of developers until a good software quality team shows them otherwise.
---
The best developers love when QA finds problems because they don’t want to be associates with shitty code. 
---
You just share an opinion different from most people. I believe that if people aren't punished for blatantly violating the TOS and actually harming the game/community as a whole, the community/longevity of the game will not last
---
Oh yes, the economy would be just peachy if the evil dupers didn't ruin the pristine economy where TSEs were selling for around max caps and god rolls would be asking for the world 3 times over and would probably be eBay-ed at a price far more ridiculous than what they are now. 
---
Don't leave out the part where dupers assassinated JFK and invented human suffering itself.
---
I've run the Poseidon event probably a dozen times, and only received one of each plan. Now I just get random recipes and stuff as a reward.
---
Maybe have someone open the door for you? As long as you can get past the laser grid you should be good.
---
I'm not the one accusing people of fanboyism for appreciating it when a developer is actively trying to fix an ADMITTEDLY broken release. I'm not crying about any criticisms of the game; it should be criticized, and the overwhelming criticism is what got Bethsoft to open their  eyes, get off their asses and get back to work.
---

Op wants his dick sucked by Todd so bad
---
Atlas is an indie game hardly anyone cares about. Fallout 76 is a AAA game from a beloved developer. Don't pretend that you can't see why this is haopening.
---
I hate the screws being required en masse for weapon crafting and power armor, difficult to find and even the best farming spots may produce a dozen or so at the high end. Plus they nerfed the screw content of every item of junk that contains them. 
---
Radaway, which is where Starched Genes comes in. Normally radaway would cure your mutations, but that perk locks them in. 
---
We're you in a party with some sharing class freak? That can sometimes make mutations buggy. 
---
After an evening with it, not only is the lever action loading count fixed, but the entire loading process is MUCH faster. It feels almost OP to have my two-shot (not explosive) LAR. I was so used to not topping off and it taking maybe 2x as long that it totally changes things. My old sniper rifle is going in the stash for now, and it's LAR all the way. Nice! Tonight I'll try Line in the Sand again. 
---
I was there yesterday and he was fighting 4 level 50 protectrons.....
---
Right?!
---
Thats a good point I don’t think you can even get doubles of those plans. At least I’ve never received them I usually power up the plants for fusion cores. 
---
Except when you're inside a building, the Mothman is always watching you, lurking in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity to attack.
---
He chose to attack me once when I was on a road just north of Watoga, if that helps.
---
I got more crashes, though still not frequent, and also loading screen images are just bright random shots of things I was near recently rather than photomode shots sometimes
---
I like this game too.  But I can't help but thinking, "Is the damage done?"  Unless they can ban the dupers and people who bought from dupers, the damage is done.  As much as it would pain me, I'd be in favor of a complete character wipe.
---
It’s not intended for the game period. And people crafting boards 200+ to intentionally DC to dupe an item is exploiting the game. And they do have an advantage but either having powerful weapons or by selling those items to get caps really quickly. The little economy the game has was tarnished with dupes. And now it may never recover 
---
...aren't all of those helmet mods?  Sounds like you overwrote two of them.
---
There are boyfriends in this game?! Where do they drop?
---
Still $40 on amazon
---
Seriously just use the best thing you've got for your level. Scrap everything else. After 50 you get things worth keeping. And if you scrap and scrap and scrap all the way up to 50 when you get a gun you like and want to use you will most likely have mods for it
---
I was trying restarting the system or force stopping the game
---
Yeah, you can. 
---
Hey, if they're dumb enough to make a video of it and put it out for everyone to see, they deserve what they get.
---
It's like speeding. If you're dumb enough to go 50mph over the speed limit *right in front of a cop*, you definitely deserve your ticket.
---
Eh explody will handle that
---
It’s Ight if you don’t like exploring a good map over a game with good story. It can get really boring in the super high levels tho, and the bugs are pretty rough too
---
I mean, I like the game. But most immersive experience? Not for me, personally
---
The BetterInventory mod will show you the combined weight at the bottom of each item tab (Weapons, Apparel, Aid, etc). It will also show you the total weight of a stack of items in it's tooltip. It also allows for sorting the items by Name(default), weight, and value in caps. Weapons, apparel, and aid also have some more sorting options.
---
They don’t need a thanks for me to be at peace. I’ll be happy just to let them get on with resolving the mess they gave us. Thanking them is analogous to thanking the person who broke your nose for cleaning your blood up.
---
How much did it cost you?
---
That's nuts!
---
Well shit then i need to get on that
---
yeah you can use different paints/skins on each part of the armour, would be nice if they allowed us to chose colours for it similar to what warframe has.
---
You’re the first person I’ve seen on Reddit that spelled “hoard” correctly. I don’t point it out to *them* but hey, good job you! :)
---
Isn't that mind of like putting yourself in a bad situation intentionally and the being praised for getting yourself out of the situation? 
---
Dont get me wrong, I'm glad Bethesda isn't giving up  but they are only really doing what is expected. 
---
I love Bethesda games up until this game. This might be biggest disappointment ive had since I started gaming. This is up there with the Dreamcast dyng. This is up there with how I felt when I first heard the walking dead game was lnt getting finished. No other developer has fallen from such heights. Bethsda has been on a hit game streak for years and years. 
---
there’s that thunder mountain substation north of watoga, it spawns a level 91 deathclaw for me everytime. might be a little level dependant but it should be around level 41 at least even if you’re under level 50
---
Thanks for this. I don't see the point in bashing Bethesda for past mistakes. Let's move on and encourage them to make improvements and continue listening to us. Otherwise it's just toxic and puts out too much negativity into a community that we want to grow.
---
And that's the goal, right? We want this thing to last a long time, for new players to join, and for Bethesda to stay energized to produce new content. They messed up, ok, but salt in the wounds isn't productive.
---
Of course they are trying its their game, they know its a mess, and they need to make money. I hate when people gives companies pats on the back for fucking something up the trying to remedy there own fuckup. 
---
The world is just as, if not more, detailed and glorious as FO4. There are some excellent stories you stumble across and some truly heart braking tales. It really feels like what it's supposed to be,  a world occupied by monsters that have overtaken humanity and it's your job to put the pieces back together. 
---
For free though?
---
I've gotten two mods at the same time for excavator PA at Harper's Ferry. 
---
I've never seen so many pathetic snitching, hall monitor, tattle tales cry about something as minuscule as duping since the last antifa rally. Honestly not sure which one is worse these soy boys constantly crying because they don't have any good weapons or the antifa fags because they ran out of colored boys to milk for the weekend. 
---
I did. Yeah, it's not "a crime". Banning you isn't also that big of a deal. You bought a game, you cheated, you got banned.   
---
Don't expect the United Nations to start an issue over it.   
---
Some people like to cheat. Those people tend to handwaive the importance of cheating. Some of us don't like to cheat. We tend to downvote those who do. It's life, don't worry too much, you'll find something else to cheat on.
---
Learn what exactly? 
---
For our conversation we only need the "taking advantage of exploits or cheats". No all that gibberish.
---
Again, prove to a court that duping is an exploit. Exploit would i solely have advantagr over other players. But its acessible to everyone, is it truly an exploit. Good luck.

That's weird considering there are tons of waterfalls all over the state. I hope they are able to add more.
---
I had one disconnect last night, but my friend, who I was teamed up with had at least 4.
---
So... Why don't you just move your camp?
---
Release date was 100% a business decision, not a development decision. Sucks when money rules everything :/
---
OMG yes!  I sat down on a bench one time while fighting mole miners.... do you know how long it takes to sit down on a bench and stand up again?  We have to hold to trade and that's harmless.
---
That place is too hardcore for one ~6 minute video, friend. One day there’ll be a wasteland cult dedicated to the brave men and women who got that place running again. 
---
*shudders* 
---
Same here! Disconnects are far worse than they’ve been for me in weeks, and I’m crashing on exit to desktop every time.
---
Maybe you're mutated with Speed Demon and don't realize it? There's a bug that if you get a mutation and you die, but the notification pops up after you respawn, you technically have the mutation, but it doesn't show up on your effects and you only get the negatives, not the positive. You should try a decontamination shower or some radaway just in case.
---
&gt;My camp walls and roofs turn invisible if I look up too high.
---
&gt;Energy weapons need a buff.
---
&gt;Need more incentive to play. The loot debuffs were a mistake. Now killing stuff like scorchbeasts and mirelurk queens is a waste of time, especially for lower level players. Preferably something to kill outside of a nuked area.
---
&gt;Alternative to power armor, not everyone likes to look like a transformer in nuked areas, and I want to use my gear or some type of gear.
---
&gt;scorchbeast queen loot is terrible and she has so many bugs, I wouldn't know where to start. 
---
&gt;Fatman is bugged. Ammo just disappears if you aim to high. 
---
&gt;scorchbeasts spam their energy attack on you repeatedly nonstop making them highly irritating and they take no damage sometimes when they should be. 
---
&gt;there should be more places to nuke than grind rather than just whitesprings and fissure site. 
---
&gt;alien weapons need to be added. 
---
&gt;human npcs.
---
&gt;I would say turret need a buff vs enemies but not so much against players. 
---
&gt;settlers would be nice. 
---
&gt;MORE HAIRSTYLES
---
&gt;Ghouls will attack you so fast that they will skip way too many frames when they lung at you. 
---
&gt;plague walker is useless and so is egghead. 
---
&gt;intelligence needs a buff. 
---
Good, but the servers are still worse than they were before the patch....
---
&gt; I'm hoping in the future I can log into Cryptos for Order-specific quests.
---
Me too! 
---
I also wish the dress looked better but hey, lol
---
There's a legendary in the Watoga medical center too. On the last floor before the roof.
---
Yeah and the caps you get from the event more than cover the cost of fast travel. Use the Travel Agent Charisma card to cut the fast travel costs by 1/3. 
---
YAY. It's something 
---
I got huge lag spikes where my game would freeze for 10 to 15 seconds. This only happened during the SBQ fight, but it has never happened before the patch.
---
Thank you for the feedback!
---
😦
---
If you're teamed up, have only one person do it, and the rest can get a free trip.
---
Not griefers when you use Reddit app sometimes it give dislikes. something to do with interface.
---
it is a string specific to a given item id, meaning, by editing the information in the client, you could theoretically tell the item server that it's supposed to be item, x, and depending on how it works, that could make it give item x to the player.
---
I get people want to be able to put custom names on their items and shit, but I'd rather other, bigger issues, be fixed before something like this is added, when the item server system is already struggling a fair bit.
---
Yeah. The “trying” should have came prior to release. 
---
Dont do like I did for the first few weeks lol I kept all kinds of weapons just because they looked cool. 
---

---
Bethesda was the publisher, not the developer of these games. Including Doom. 
---
Where's the red dress?
---
&gt;Instead of banning them why not just delete their characters? It's not necessarily their fault the game had an exploit that allowed them to duplicate items.
---
It IS their fault. These people chose to exploit a known bug for personal gain or amusement and publicize it on YouTube. 
---
I've been one shot with PA on. Happen Weds night at nuke event. Its occurred many times for me.
---
Ohhhhhhhhhh that explains why I've never seen it. I just went here for the first time a few days ago... and I have two 100+ characters ahaha.
---
I made an alt just to get a lvl50 version of it. Definitely not dissappointed. 
---
One of my team-mate got an alcohol addiction. At no point had his character ever drank alcohol. However, he was always keen to go charging into a building with guns blazing, then more often than not I'd need to revive him. I got sick of using stimpaks and invested in Quack Surgeon (revive a fallen player with alcohol)
---
I revived him so many times, he got addicted. 
---
Why does this sub need to have this discussion every single day?
---
I’ve been playing the game for roughly 50 hours and just encountered him for the first time. I had no clue it was even him, I heard the music change and started looking for an enemy then he teleported right beside me. 
---
I always thought this. But you have the "legitinate players" who want to be able to pass the games intended thresholds and hold 3 k lbs on their "mule".
---
 Yeah, because if Bethesda limits us to 600 lb. stache due to stability purposes, 3000 lbs on your character surely is unrelated! /s
---
finally

I’m down for SBQ. GT- Xwolfpackleader

At level 107 my camp is the same size as at level 7, must be doing something wrong. Only thing left in my stored is a water purifier that won’t scrap (get unexpected error when trying). I have my crafting stations, floor and a bed.
---
Last time I sent someone a team request in a nuke zone, they joined and fast traveled to my camp. I spent the next hour getting the materials to repair it. He even left the server before I could kill him for the bounty. 
---
I use a Death Tambo like a gentleman, I'll have you know. The jingle gives you warning of my approach 
---
My thing is that for a game that I paid $100+ on it was pretty much a poorly built fallout 4 DLC (looks the same, feels the same expect way less stuff to do compared to the base fallout 4 game. My quest list is pretty empty). And it's really really annoying me that it keeps crushing everytime I try complete the BoS quest line, every damn time.......
---
Kinda my thinking
---
I can agree at least make it a ton
---
go check out r/fo76FilthyCasuals sounds like you'll fit right in. 
---
So true!
---
Yes, you can mix and match as much as you please. Each armour piece is painted individually, and you can paint each one with whatever you have available to you.
---
Similarly you can mix and match different types of power armour. You could have a piece from different sets on one frame, all painted differently too.
---
That’s my spot too! Heya neighbor 
---
Healing factor only works outside of combat
---
I am taking my time in the same as well over 100 hours and am only level 50.  There is absolutely no reason to rush to level.  I have a couple friends I play with and we just take our time with everything
---
View Profile-&gt; Block (on the psn page).
---
Same. I'm trying out Red Dead Online. I feel like it will be boring to be honest but 76 feels pointless for me atm
---
I know mine doesn’t work at all it doesn’t even say it does anything in my pipboy
---
Personally i think banning is a last resort thing. Read me first comment again. I do think punishment is due. Cheating is wrong. But permaban is imo too much.
---
You are probably using armor that adds carry weight potential. When you get into your PA, that armor is no longer relevant.
---
Um, the biggest games right now are all social. PUBG, Fortnite, overwatch.. 
---
And this game is not one I would care super social...
---
I’d just like to actually receive an explosive weapon, of any kind.  I’ve played thousands of hours on FO4 and getting close to hundreds on FO76. And to this day , I’ve never gotten one on either game.  
---
There are 7, 2 unique in Watoga train station &amp; super duper marktet, another unique in that city near the armory (can't get the name right now). Then you have Raider, Responder, Whitesprings and Enclave.  
---
That's 1400 caps you can sell everyday.
---
Yes, but doing that removes the only reason youtubers exist. Monetization.  
---
They'll do videos to "show how it's done and get it fixed", if Youtube pays them for every guy that clicks on it. 
---
"A thief believes everybody steals."
---
I believe it's because you don't get the pocketed and deep-pocketed bonuses from your regular armor when you are wearing power armor.
---
Going to miss finding him doing karate in the most random parts of Watoga
---
I hope that's true. I'll try to keep an eye on my ammo and see if I can catch it in action.
---
Even so they should remove the text that pops up, then. Such an odd glitch
---
NelsonMuntz_laugh.aiff
---
It is not.
---
Was I not the one asking you for advice with alternatives?
---
Did I not express an interest in experimenting with diluted rad-x?
---
Did we not discuss the validity ghoulish and rad sponge? Of which you have evidently had different results than I.
---
During these discussions you have time and time again argued against my ethos rather than simply explaining your side of it. I don't feel like I've done or said anything to warrant it, thus I brought it up, because I find the approach baffling and unnecessary. Perhaps it's a Reddit standard that I'm not quite used to. It's the first time it has happened to me. I consider these remarks towards my ethics, intelligence and person as  needless attacks in an otherwise decent discussion.
---
With but a quick look at your profile, it does appear to be your default way of responding to people. To debase them and their intelligence, while holding your own as sacrosanct. Frankly, you've come across as nothing but arrogant and filled with ill will towards me, as though I am but a pleb in your presence to not have unlocked the intricate secrets of non-PA to join you in your illustrious club that stands high above.
---
Perhaps I am guilty of those old meme in which the purpose of arguing on the internet is portrayed as pointless. Perhaps it is excessively idealistic of me to expect or even hope for a civil and pleasant discourse on the internet. It is unfortunate though, because you do seem knowledgeable about the game and its inner workings, but one's inclination to listen diminishes greatly when it has to be accompanied by negative remarks towards one's person.
---
Thus, my simple advice to you would be to simply share your knowledge with people and leave the ad hominem at home. There's really no need for it.
---
With that, admittedly less than humble remark, I shall end this discussion with you. It seems futile to hope for a pleasant discourse in which anything useful is elicited at this point. Simply bickering won't get either of us anywhere. I will, of course, grant you the courtesy  of reading your next reply, which I am certain will be a heavy-handed retort! You will have the final word, as it were.
---
I wish you all the best, no ill will and hope that you continue to find joy in a game that has brought me much enjoyment. May we both find more pleasant and fruitful discussions in the future, in which the topics are discussed without needless degradation of the people behind it.
---
Godspeed and good day to you.
---
It’s the fucking dupers you can always find them on the map... They seem to always crash the server...
---
You can only have 1 mod on a piece of power armor, that's why there is only 1 mod slot. When installing a new one there is even a pop up message warning you that you'll delete the old one 
---
Oh damn yes thanks !!!! i was going to download from YT and go in music programs to have it but this is perfect thanks man \^\^
---
Ideally, with added complexity, there would be *more* time between beta and launch.
---
Almost all of my location based challenges are bugged.. I can't complete any other them. 
---
For instance all of the biome specific challenges say 'Discover X Locations in the Mire', I've been to all of the places listed and it still only shows like 5/15 or whatever.
---
I hope they fix all of these, I've recently been trying to go through and complete all the challenges but some of them I currently can't.
---
Do you have a lot of deep pocketed armor? Your regular armor is suppressed when you're in power armor.
---
Put up a couple small water purifiers and start a mutfruit, tato, and  corn farm. Craft veggie starch a t a cooking station and ur good.
---
Hope this helps!
---
I've seen a ton today. Lots of messages about the server not responding. I wonder if dupers are furiously trying to figure out another way to dupe or something.
---
Any armor you are wearing that adds to carry weight (pocketed mods or +str) do not affect your stats when wearing power armor. This goes for all stats on armor and extends to legendaries as well. 
---
Now if they can fix it so it remembers which two weapons you're switching between that'd be great.
---
Hate when I get mobbed and go to switch to my melee weapon only to see my fucking fists like I'm a goddamn old timey boxer
---
You dont even need the scorched prefix. My pipe bolt action with explosive 1-2 shots max level scorched with a sneak.  Explosive is so broken and needs to not be effected by demoliton expert.
---
I got one last night as well. A TSE I believe...though I can't be 100% sure though because as soon as I grabbed it the server crashed and when i logged back in, the gun was gone. It would have been my first TSE....the servers are fucking garbage after the patch....
---
It's actually not.  You can see in your quest log following her journey is a side quest.  Main quest is stopping the Scorchbeasts.
---
I just wanna know what the song is in the background. 
---
As a fellow fanboy I can agree it blinds you. I bought the Aliens: Colonial Marines special edition about a year after it came out, knowing fully about why it was so badly received, but I still enjoyed spending more time in that universe. Same with 76. I bought it 2 weeks after release, even after reading about all the ways it fucks up every day here on reddit, but I don't care. 
---
Ah, that's what I suspected but it really makes zero sense so I thought surely that's not the case.
---
Same, been playing since BETA. I go to as many nuke events and hunt legendaries, travel all over the map, yet no explosive and the only 2-shot I got is a laser pistol.
---
Gonna have to find this!!
---
You already have it...well sorta...the AK (Handmade) is chambered in 5.56 instead of 7.65
---
You can do anything you want if you grind.
---
Saying "it's easy, just grind for a few hours" is like complaining "this game is too easy." 
---
I got addicted to Sweetwater Tea, lmao. Never noticed any negative effects though.
---
If it worked it would be PvP, its open to exploitation so no not really. 
---
I was in a session yesterday that was pretty empty. Someone launched a nuke at Whitespring, but no-one showed up for it, so my buddy and I had it all to ourselves. 
---
Stayed in that session for quite a few hours, ended up being just the two of us, then just me when he left. After he left I headed to Whitespring. Even 5-6 hours after a nuke there, there were still bloated glowers all over the place. I went to run inside and get a more powerful weapon. After the inside loaded I get "controls temporarily disabled" for a few seconds then disconnected from server. 
---
Holy fuck the vitriol in this thread for people who you've never met on the grounds that you somehow hold a morally superior position for not using some glitches is insane. Why even stop at perma-bans and as some suggested cross-platform hardware bans? Just kill em right? Clearly if someone copied an item in Gods own game Fallout76 they have committed original sin and must be judged!
---
Hmm you might be right, just server hopped a bunch of times to check. Seems like if he sees something he still attacks it but they no longer all see each other through walls. Think I'll remove this since title is sort of misleading
---
I don't see Cramburger in your listings of recipes. It gives +20 Carry Capacity and is affected by Carnivore (Can't satisfy hunger for Herbivore) Recipe found at the Steakhouse under the name Recipe: Delbert's Bunless Cramburger.
---
Strang in numbers is bugged and sometimes suppresses your mutations by accident. Unequip the card.
---
I'm going to upvote your courage for leaving your comment for witness. 
---
Oh I have that too but as a .50 cal user I can never have enough steel and lead. The extra parts, wood, rubber and plastic are useful too so everything gets grabbed. When I have everything scrapped I pick through and toss what I need most.
---
I believe I got a lvl 50 one when I completed the quest I would need to check but pretty sure it was at my level.
---
I’ll try that thanks
---
Just north of new gad near the lakeside cabins workshop is decent. The only spawns are low level supermutants, robots and scorched and you get frogs, foxes and radstag within shooting range. There’s a little stream you can drop purifiers on. And it’s a decently centrally located spot. Close to whitesprings. 
---
You'll have mods/perks equipped that boost your equip load when not in Power Armor. As soon as you step into PA, these carry weight boosts will no longer apply.
---
Oh i know ahah look at the downvotes.
---
But i do think cheaters should be punished. Just that banning is a last resort excessive thing. 
---
Thunder mountain:  minimum lv41 deathclaw, for me (lvl 100+) it's level 91. There's also a good chance it can be 3* legendary.
---
Hopewell cave: level 91 deathclaw spawn
---
Twin lakes: level 90 behemoth
---
Various areas in cranberry bog: high level mirelurk queens (watch out for scorchbeast)
---
Dolly sods campgrounds: high level Yao guai (75 was highest I've seen)
---
Dyer chemical: high level bots ( robobrain, gutsy, sentrybot)
---
I usually make a point to hit these spots on any server.
---
Exactly, one youtuber I watched suggested that if they would’ve charged $30 as an early release and then $60 once it’s finished people wouldn’t be so pissed off, and I completely agree, like this game is so worth $30 to me but it being unfinished to this degree is so not worth the $60 price tag
---
It might be true.  They might not have been able to do a proper full dive into their own game. 
---
The line of thinking I'm trying to present is that pre BETA they probably were dealing with much bigger and nastier bugs than what we've been seeing. So either no ability to fully dive into their own game, or bigger fish to fry than what we've seen.
---
Well, so long X-01. You were fun while it lasted. Back to toting around excavator I guess.
---
I was kind of thinking this as well.
---
Nah definitely not making more money then Bethesda, but people selling duped guns are scummy. And people BUYING duped guns are mentally challenged. These things are very easy to buy with caps, most guys are selling them for under 10k now and in most cases I’ve seen guns go for as little as 5k if it’s a known dupe 
---
iN toDd wE tRUst
---
same thing happened with me, but mine was a 2 hot 2 star...Knowing my luck it was probably a TSE....the servers are terrible with this patch.
---
I had this issue too. I'm the guy in the middle. If I'm interested I'll follow the story but I won't read every terminal and every note. My friend does. My other friend reads nothing. If he is interested he will run YouTube videos to see what happened while he'd slotting glowies at the golf course. 
---
Hey, I didn't call you a fanboy for that. It was because you were agitated when confronted with reasonable arguments. Anyway, at least we agree on some parts so let's bury the hatchet and move on.
---
dupers are in a panic
---
What lvl is that perk available? 
---
Usually just a crown enemy for me, but thank you, I'll check it out.
---
Blocker and Incisor are must haves for melee folk
---
Game never had economy tho
---
How about Centralia, PA?  Town has literally been on fire for 50 years.
---
Do i need to lvl them up to higher tank?
---
And what is class freak for?
---
or make it so that we can put one of out Photo Mode shots into a picture frame/poster to hang on the CAMP wall
---
I hate that to when I’m farming for the BOS combat armor mods and every time it just got more and more annoying and at one point I just shut off all of the game sounds. But yes they need to do this.
---
Congrats, you're a dick.
---
I agree with that, it was one more thing I didnt need to lug around a ton of
---
We have such limited stash space if they set it so the frame with armor on it weighs 10 + all the pieces on it, it would be disastrous.
---
That said, what's the point of showing a little icon with armor rating and such for a power armor frame in the pip boy if it all just reads 0 no matter what pieces are on it. It's impossible to tell a frame with pieces on it from an empty one when looking at it in your inventory, which is super annoying.
---
Instigating/+10% while aiming/+1 AGI is my wet dream.
---
The road that connects sons of Dane and the pumpkin house has always spawned various high level monsters as well. If you start at sons of Dane and walk on the road to the pumpkin house you have a chance of spawning deathclaws, Yao guai, fog crawlers super mutants, scorchbeast, and flatwood monster. Their minimum level is 65. Good luck!
---
&gt;they thought they could release an unfinished and buggy game like they always do
---
This is the most annoying thing is the video game industry. They push out buggy games rather that waiting for it to be stable. The beta was only like 2 weeks! Should've been more like 2 months.
---
Are you really suggesting a change because it's near the closest vendor to \*your\* CAMP? 
---
You read the patch notes but not the release dates? Ps4 and xbox get it on Monday 
---
Exactly for this issue , before I launch the nuke I look at the social screen and then compare it to RECENT PLAYERS on the Xbox dashboard menu and know if I can get kicked/crashed I can "join game" from the dashboard it has saved me sooooo many times as I launch around 3 nukes a day solo ha
---
Sunnytop is notorious. I fought 3 level 60+ (one was 80~) and about 6-8 scorched as well. I was just looking for a quiet vendor trip. But they do appear there often.
---
It still sucks at 50. I waited and got mine and was disappointed with the damage. Flame damage doesn't seem to stack like bleed.
---
I think it was to the southeast, but don’t hold me to it. My wife likes to wander around in random directions looking for stuff that isn’t on the map. 
---
Read again. I dont cheat. It says there.
---
From my perspective banning is a last resort excessive thing.
---
United nation no, but a consumer rights attorney may. 
---
There is nothing any individual can say to convince you to buy trash. Some people just like trash like some people just want to eat human shit. Just because you're simple enough or enslaved enough by a feedback loop does not mean that you are right. All it really means is that your judgement is untrustworthy. You don't listen to obese people giving health advice, and you don't take gaming purchase recommendations from NPCs.
---
I have a friend who plays like that. We leave him behind -_- I'm not going to spend 30 min to walk to a blast zone.  And no I'm not missing out on anything, I explore all the time. But given limited time play usually I want to get to quests or events and complete them before I have to log. 
---
I keep 20-30 of each of the good ones and sell the rest! That and purified water are where I make a lot of my caps to blow on power armor mods!
---
That works too.
---
&gt; you could theoretically tell the item server that it's supposed to be item 
---
no, the client doesn't have to communicate any data to the server at all. it doesn't have to tell the server what it's supposed to be at all. the server simply gives the client the unique IDs and the client parses the unique IDs and assign them a new name.
---
the server keeps track of all items and the client has no way of altering any information; it merely access information.
---
That would make my day. I would pay for that.
---
Level 44. My best non-quest legendary is a Zealot’s shotgun. :-/
---
As compared to who? The douche with the turret farm? 
---
Thanks, just got starched genes their 2 and I’m planning out wich mutations I’m going to get tonight. Seems pretty broken to me. Is it?
---
Agreed my friend, I hope they don’t give up on it either. It’s apparent to me that there’s others who take the game for what it is and not “what it should/could have been.” I’m not saying I throw a fucking party every time the server disconnects, but I move past it and relog because I love the game even with its glitches and bugs. If you let this stuff get to you, you’re gonna have a bad time. The people who can deal are going to be the ones enjoying themselves when it inevitably becomes a well populated title like ESO
---
I agree about the criticism and I think Bethesda is doing a great job of targeting the complaints I see here in this sub and elsewhere(I’m looking at you,levergun) and they’re making an effort to fix the things that annoy us all the most. The problem I have with what I’m seeing in places like YouTube is that it’s become a meme to shit on this game for follows and views. And we all as a community need to know where to separate hate and witch-hunting from actual constructive criticism. 
---
Up doots to the above for being civil
---
The rewards are garbage anyway after last patch it’s all 1 star junk they pretty much nerfed that event
---
Yeah I just read the patch notes from reddit. Sorry!
---
Everyone that hated the game has already left because they didn't wanna wait for the company to hear from the customers of the game.  Bethesda is definitely trying, and it's obvious they are listening to us.  Haven't played in a few weeks (just needed a break from fo) gonna have to get back into it tonight
---
To get loads of food, either cook the meat from the animals you’re killing or plant crops at your camp. For water, just build a water pump at your camp and spam “collect” then when you have enough, go to the kitchen crafting station and changed dirty water into boiled water. 
---
i dont think you understand what a building block is for a fallout game since you've probably never played one if youre claiming NPCs with characters and a story arent a building block. Its obvious youre a troll so im going to take my win here and let you be salty that i didnt fall for your traps. Take the L and move on kid and go play fallout NV or something. Enjoy the block KID
---
Litterallythe first beer my wife drank in the game got her the addicted debuff. Personally I've had 2-3 addictions that needed curing.
---
Take it from a fellow explorer of open world games, it's a lot of fun. I do recommend you get the Enforcer perk though for shotguns. It make crippling legs of creatures much easier, and will save you some headaches when exploring.
---
I had a Deathclaw charging me and managed to blow out both its knees. Then I just ran up and beat it to death with a baseball bat. This also works well on fast moving creatures, such as the Wendigo. The perk is a life saver.
---
There is an economy in fo76? Without a single players market i am forced to server hop all over the place looking for building plans. 
---
I'm on PS4, so haven't had the patch yet. This issue I noticed has been there for quite some time.
---
I hope the new issues wont happen to me once we get the patch on console.
---
Those are amazing pictures
---
That other guy isn't a dick for aggroing all the enemies as soon as they spawn in and taking other people's kills/legendaries before they can make it back there to kill them?
---
Leader boards or not. This is a multiplayer game that borders on the MMO prospects of things, this type of game tends to have a end game and with that end game comes Loot/Achievements/Cosmetics. Clearing all that and having the ability to do so is either by Gear or Skill which having either of those puts you into the top tier of the game. Top Tier being end game. If it seems i'm upset cause i'm jealous then maybe i'm not saying this correctly. I'm upset because the same people who come on here and trash this game every chance they get, happen to also be some of those who are cheating and causing issues.
---
same here, only two shot i got was a combat shotgun. 
---
Definitely not bad but no god roll either. 
---
And at this point i have no use for it anymore as i just switched to heavy / rifle use. 
---
At least 15 people helped with this. And good luck with your attempt!
---
As others have mentioned, we really need another way of gaining mods and plans for the power armors. 
---
The events that have a small chance of giving them, only drops T60 motion assist servos plans most of the time. The best I have gotten, was a plan for the T51b left arm. Besides, the events also appear way too rarely. 
---
I have started saving the T60 motion assist servos plans it rewards so I can take a picture of how many times it gives them, compared to how many times I have completed the event.
---
 Hopefully, that will catch the attention of one of the community managers here from Bethesda, so they might make some changes, or at least suggest them. 
---
 - How about daily missions from Phoenix that have a high chance of only dropping power armor mod plans? 
---
 - Make events that can give them as a reward, appear more often. 
---
 - How about making all the plans available to buy, but for an inflated amount of caps? We could unlock them via Daily missions or doing Enclave events. 
---
 - Let us "scrap" plans we can't use into a form of currency, we can exchange for guaranteed new plans at a vendor machine. 
---
Feel free to comment with your own suggestion, or why one of mine wouldn't work properly. 
---
Disagree with that - there are accidental bounties.  I have pacifist on at all times.  I was in the Gorge junkyard (public workshop) and it was claimed.  I didn't mess with anything the owner built.  I was scrounging junk in the buildings and in one of the wrecked buses in the yard, there was a green footlocker type container that was locked.  It was not player built, it was part of the "scenery".  I picked the lock to see what was inside - just standard randomly generated loot, but I got a bounty of 10 caps for doing so.  Didn't know that would happen.  Fortunately about an hour later, someone mowed me down and hung around and let me get my stuff back.
---
That's how an mmo works, everything is mostly there to show you how it works so that when you hit max level (50 in this case) you know what you want to do and how most things work
---
Nah...
---
you can get calibrated shocks for your armor legs, and add 100 carry weight. the X01 re hard to come by, but you can wear some t60 legs
---
Yes, Only Once though. It was quite effective when i tryed out my  1 star MIRV modded Daisycutter (-90% carry weight). 
---
I had some STR heavy weapons perks, but not everything, reload speed matters here a lot imho.
---
i had about 12-14 mini nukes, I waited until she landed, and completely unloaded everything. players in the area probably felt it, #passivemodespam, SBQ@ 50% from about 90. i do not claim this was all me, the melee'rs were all in her grill and we ate SBQ, steak sooon after. but the bar certainly moved when i was unloading.
---

---
I've enjoyed fallout 3 ,Vegas , and 76 all for many reasons. I enjoy 76. the holotape stories, terminal, and notes tell so many stories. joint a battle vs the switch queen was amazing my first time. I'm level 80 and still have yet explored watoga area. i really enjoy 76.
---
This is literally the same way bethesda has released every major game. Expecting day one not to be buggy as hell and buying the game is using your wallet not your brain. I love the game, but expecting anything other then what we got is delusional.
---
They strongly implied to duping on their secondary accounts too.
---
&gt; Another thing is that me and him have **barely done any duping or mass crafting recently** and at all for that matter **on our second accounts** that got banned today.
---
The word magic in their statement is that they haven't done any cheating recently on those accounts.
---
That aside, the other interesting implication for this is that Bethesda **does** have a way of looking historically for duping.
---
The very first time I used Buffout, at level 3. It was a fluke. I waited until I had a second addictol before clearing it. I had the same one about 30 levels later, but by then I had six addictol. 
---
Yeah, it can vary. 
---
Bet your friends love you when the cops show up.
---
I send one, and it worked? I guess? XD
---
As someone who also frowns upon this dumb shit and I applaud you for a deed well-done. 
---
Should be bound to 'G' but you can change it to whatever you want in the options menu under keybindings
---
You didn't happen to met an Eyebot it did you ;-)
---
You mean "The game isnt perfect so I have a right to exploit the shit out of it" mentality?
---
Yeah its pretty delusional...
---
Eh, he's a tool too. Neither of you are innocent here. IMO.
---
For one not-as-shitty solution: As I debated with another player last week, wait until the guy leaves, then either take advantage of his turrets and hit each ghoul once and save your ammo or torch just the turrets. Leaving the workbenches helps everyone in the area.
---
Mini-me version: [https://imgur.com/a/sEX8TMt](https://imgur.com/a/sEX8TMt)
---
I doubt I’ll ever get around to it! I’d much rather enjoy the game itself - I’ve always liked leading projects but always hated not being able to enjoy them myself in the sense that it becomes a chore.
---
Select it then hold left alt
---
Also can we mark plans at vendors i already have or a list inventory where ican see if i used it yet.
---
good fuck those assholes. 
---
r/woosh
---
I've had 4 attempts. 1st time thr cares you have to use to get past the storage room glitched out. Second was final phase server disconnect. Third was the attempt I mentioned. And fourth was a rousing success. 
---
It's the melee key.  But I bound it to my middle mouse button 
---
But saying it should be easy is dumb as hell bro. It was more or less a play to russle your jimmies.  The real fact is to do something in a large indexed videogame that spans many servers types and consoles with specifc netcode requirements, to hunt for a specifc chain of data that MAY or MAY NOT be able to be read together, to target would be more difficult then saying hop on it bethesda. 
---
You make yourself look like an invalid just by saying it's easy. 
---
Thanks bb. Love you 
---
I have done Poseidon once and didn’t get it and thought there was a fast way to get it (caps). Seems to be the only plan you can’t get duplicates of then. 
---
And there *shouldn't* be a combination that makes you invincible. Blocker is 45% melee damage, so almost half of all damage places like Whitesprings. Combined with 300+ dr, should last for longer than 3 seconds. Serendipity only goes off below the threshold, sure, but one I drop under that threshold, it's a pretty decent chance. I should start taking noticably less damage. Also, does it have an icon/noise that pops up when it procs, like other perks do (nerd rage, lucky break, etc.)? Because if so, I've never seen it pop up.
---
With scorchbeasts, I know it's explosive. We'll see how the fireproof thing works, once the patch comes out. I've been hunting for dense plans forever, but no luck so far. But still. None of my teammates have dense armor, and none of them instantly die whenever a sb looks at them either, despite having, supposedly, lower defense numbers. Just feels a little weird.
---
Yes, Starched Genes has two ranks, and Class Freak has 3. Class Freak reduces the penalty of mutations by 75%. A must have if you want a lot of mutations 
---
Maybe I don't see too much of an effect after the DR? I have all of the auto rifle perks for armor piercing, and my 10mm SMG eats through Scorched and SBs like nothing else... I use a higher damage AR with armor piercing ammo and reciever too, and that doesn't compare to the SMG.
---
As I just replied to the OP - the other guy is a tool too. There are just better ways to deal with this situation. IMO.
---
No. Its not that. I just doubt that most of it would hold a case on court. 
---
A TOS is full of general definitions subject to interpretation. 
---
Define exploit, duping and bug in a court... its hardly a case. 
---
All in all, i just think that banning is excessive. Punishment? Yes. Banning? Only in extreme cases.
---
ARE THEY trying? It's still buggy as hell and riddled with problems. This sub acts like Bethesda is a benevolent god for trying to salvage the dumpster fire they created.
---
It's okay to enjoy the game. I did too for a time when I picked it up  The problem is when you can't distinguish legitimate criticism and label it all as a hate train.
---
Bethesda launcher is Windows only, so gonna have to bootcamp it. 
---
And in my case it had been so long since I booted into windows I was greeted with about 3 hours worth of updates, ugh lol
---
I'm good with my lever action. Send me your name next time you're online.
---
Congrats, you're probably one of the scrubs that does this.
---
It's okay. :D I managed to do a rerun and finish. 
---
[Feedback]
---
As others have mentioned, we really need another way of gaining mods and plans for the power armors.
---
The events that have a small chance of giving them, only drops T60 motion assist servos plans most of the time. The best I have gotten, was a plan for the T51b left arm. Besides, the events also appear way too rarely.
---
I have started saving the T60 motion assist servos plans it rewards so I can take a picture of how many times it gives them, compared to how many times I have completed the events.
---
Hopefully, that will catch the attention of one of the community managers here from Bethesda, so they might make some changes, or at least suggest them.
---
 - How about daily missions from Phoenix that have a high chance of only dropping power armor mod plans?
---
 - Make events that can give them as a reward, appear more often.
---
 - How about making all the plans available to buy, but for an inflated amount of caps? We could unlock them via Daily missions or doing Enclave events.
---
 - Let us "scrap" plans we can't use into a form of currency, we can exchange for guaranteed new plans at a vendor machine.
---
Feel free to comment with your own suggestion, or why one of mine wouldn't work properly.
---
😘

As a wise courier once said,
---
“*No need to destroy the Bear, just cut its throat.*”
---
So now you think i'm the one making up numbers?
---
50 is max? Why do I see people at lvl120? Is that box not their level?
---
I wish we could buy a Mr handy to carry all our stuff around like a companion. Have no offense capabilities but also can't be killed, just downed. Also make sure he traps you in doors just for the nostalgia.
---
*cough*
---
Maybe.
---
It's bigger than the other maps combined, correct?
---
I think you're talking about the Vault bed? The plan is listed as "Vault Bed 2" at the Whitespring Resort.
---
Thank you for your response!
---
I found it the most terrifying game I have played in ages. It is one of my worst nightmares, being alone.
---
In the other Fallout you aren't alone. Even the Lone Wanderer had companions and only Fallout 4 had you be the Sole Survivor of a Vault but the world had people.
---
Fallout 76 has NO ONE. For all you know you could be the only person still alive in the entire world.
---
Now you need to find out why.
---
Someone reference the Langoliers in a recent post. Just like that. You just missed the cataclysm.
---
I loved playing solo. The team ups worked quite well and we had some fun discovering some of the locations and a friend often found things I missed and vice versa
---
Thanks that's a good idea 
---
Lol, Now I want to see mole-rat with a deathclaw name tag.
---
good luck with that. Banning people for duping is something that has been done since Diablo 2 at least, and it's perfectly legal to do so, because it breaks the TOS.  
---
But if you want, you can waste a ton of dollars paying an attorney to defend yourself from your ban. Cheater.
---
Both hunger and thirst seem to tick down much faster now. Not overencumbered, no mutations, very limited chem use (only stims).
---
Interested in that also , same reason I couldn't interact was due to not having responders outfit to test if there was another outcome.
---
40 pounds is not worth it for any weapon
---
sounds *perfect*
---
I didnt burn through the game since release.  It's now a few months in and I am only level 40ish.  I am taking my time, spending it playing with friends and exploring.
---
Something to do with megasloth meat and mushrooms.  I was looking for megasloths a little bit ago.
---
Haha I had no idea it was so rare... I've actually found two broadsiders from random drops, and scrapped them both because stash limit and I'm running a rifleman build.
---
I put my camp on a lead node, extractor gives 14 lead every time I visit and it's still not enough...
---
Seriously. I get disagreement but calling it shilling? Kinda desperate of them to try to frame things that way.
---
Certainly some skepticism is healthy, but every aspect of the ui is the same as 76, and this is video evidence, not a bunch of people repeating a rumor
---
There are a myriad of reasons why its a dick move to turret farm here aside from stealing kills from those players legit going through the area. Ever tried doing the already pain in the butt quest to kill unruly golfer ghouls? Yeah...
---
Please no. I like to be that exclusive ^^
---
Harpers Ferry?
---
Ooh, yea great idea!
---
Lots popped by and watched, some even cheering on!
---
Not one tried to collect the 1200 caps bounty, guess they agreed with me :) 
---
Thank you so so much, I've been looking for this for a long time. 
---
You got a weapon that jingle jangles
---
okay, you can.
---
buy why?
---
All of which have an entirely different market and fanbase than fallout. 
---
Right, but I mean moreso.
---
Hazmat suits work, but once they fix the bug with Herd Mentality, I plan on sharing my level 3 Rad Sponge with my group (as well as having the endurance perks for rad resistance of course) and then trying to run it with regular armor.
---
This should be the most up voted comment. 
---
Speed demon wasn't working on the lever action reload before the patch. I thought it was the animation change that effected the speed but maybe speed demon got an update. Nothing in the patch notes about it though.
---
Depending on the veracity of the email, it appears they're cracking down on accounts with "excessively high" item counts. Like the dudes with 10,000 of each bobblehead. That's not an accident. That's obvious exploitation. I guess that doesn't stop people from lying on the internet, but I doubt they consider 2 of the same item excessively high. Hell, I had that bug where items stored in the camp were duped, but I believe they know the difference between having 50 water purifiers and having 50 TSE shotguns, 50 TSE handmade rifles, and the rest.
---
Ah thx.
---
&gt; That's how an mmo works
---
I guess this might be core to why I hate MMOs.

Well how long you last against how many?  Serendipity won't stop you from dying from like.. for example a 40 point hit for example.  It'll only stop you from dying half the time until you take another 40 point hit that it doesn't prevent.  It's usefulness I think is questionable.
---
The schorchbeast thing is weird.  You should investigate further.  Personally I don't have the plan, i just found a mod on a vendor for my current chestpiece.  I have the plans for some types of armor but not the one i'm wearing.  You can use padded too, it helps quite a bit still.  Maybe they have padded?  Or don't pay attention or something.
---
I put mine on in the nuke zones. Otherwise, running around the wastes always in power armor seems silly to me 
---
I haven't had many attacks, but yes, the beasts that do attack tend to be around level 50ish.
---
the one with the sheets is called modern bed
---
I've had as many CTD crashes as I have disconnects. Maybe more. And of course, when the game crashes, it's "always on top" so you can't even pull up task manager or a command prompt to kill the process. I always have to either sign out and back in or manually turn off my PC and back on again, which is not at all healthy for it. Extremely frustrating and takes me back ro the first or second patch stability-wise.
---
Ooo...argue argue argue......they fail.
---
Lol, in all seriousness they are doing what they can but they still should have had this crap fixed when the game came out not 2 months after.   I'm still playing so I dont mind, but for those who threw in the towel, or paid full value and quit....it still sucks they didnt release a game that was up to snuff in the first place.
---
Its hard work down in the spring mines
---
I've found a scorched mothman that was killing me in one hit, I'm level 70ish. Yours is the first I've heard of a similar encounter.
---
Bethesda isn't the little indie studio that could. They dropped the ball and now they have to work their asses off to pick it back up. If they keep up this behavior up for years I'll be convinced they are serious in their contrition. If Todd comes to E3 this  year and makes jokes about Fallout76 like it was some cute shit I'll know they learned nothing.
---
Because they only gave us one functional staircase and this one is more entertaining
---
Explosive weapons are pretty bad, if your not specifically doing an explosive build or have a weapon with the explosive legendary effect, I would scrap or sell them.
---
The 10mm smg is pretty good in general, I have a furious one and it shreds.
---
Can someone tell me if it negates ALL mods on armor? What about legendary effects?
---
I can return the game for being crap, and then be perfectly happy playing something else.
---
get calibrated shocks for the legs
---
I think YouTubers  should be encouraged to make glitch videos honestly. If a glitch gets really popular from a YouTuber it pressures Bethesda to fix it. I’m not saying you should exploit glitches but I’d rather have a popular glitch in the game till it’s patched rather than a glitch not a lot of people know about in the game forever.
---
It was a bit of a shock to everyone when the 8th Ed codex came out and they had added the accent mark in the name. 😊
---
Actually looks like it is! Don't worry, I've only logged in once and not been able to place my camp since moving a week or so ago.
---
Yeah I feel the pain. I tossed away about 500 rounds of .308 ammo
---
I have just started my 4th last night
---
This honestly might be the best part. You can almost fire as fast on empty because reloading a single round takes about the same amount of time as the normal time in between shots. 
---
Easiest/safest thing is just hop servers.
---
If they are using a TSE, you can try running right up to them (without engaging).  If they shoot when you are to close they will blow themselves up.
---
It has p2w lootboxes multiplayer.  
---
The campaign is single player, but it was soo much an online service as, say, RDR2 is. It's a single player game with an online service multiplayer game attached.
---
Bug report? 
---
Bug: varying damage numbers
---
Console: Xbox One 
---
Gamer tag: Dogwood Dingus 
---
Description: upon logging in damage numbers from a variety of my weapons will fluctuate. Typically they will drop to very low numbers when it should be higher and consistent. For example one day pipe guns did 60 damage, then next they were doing 50, no passive effects were changed or in play. This ‘bug’ happens to all of my weapons with no real cause, the excuse a friend of mine and I have used is something to do with the server issues. In gameplay there is a very noticeable decrease in damage output when this bug is in play, it seems to lower the overall damage of my weapons rather than displaying improper damage numbers. It’s far more common then I’d like to admit. 
---
Also I noticed somebody was trying to team up with me and I think it allows for you to grab loot from their kills ? i helped a few people out this way .. the only time I will accept an invite is now in a nuke zone, I have no issue with that. I noticed some people still will not or are too busy to.
---
I found energy weapons to work fine. I was a melee build and kept like 4+ guns at all times and energy weapons seemed fine, in fact I found that if you get a laser gun at a low level it’s wastly superior to any ballistic gun you’ll get for a while, definitely did more damage then the displayed number. Although they did feel sort of like “mid” level weapons, like if you get one early it’s super strong but higher level one get outperformed by ballistic so eh. Also explosives were sooooooo much stronger in FO4 even lower level explosives one shot most non boss enemys without explosive perks while in 76 they do absolutely nothing 
---
Hazmat Marsupial, pretty much immortal. If you use SinN, you’ll have good resistance and jump height so players won’t be a big problem.
---
 In video games, an **exploit** is the use of a **bug** or glitches, game system, rates, hit boxes, speed or level design etc. by a player to their advantage in a manner not intended by the game's designers.
---
In case that wasn't already clear.
---
Would love to but I've yet to find the plan or a mod laying around.
---
Like serious or did you forget the /s? Did it launch 2 flares? I want it. 
---
He is either the Scumbag Steve of his group ready to give those out or Good Guy Greg for taking them...
---
Nevermind that turrets are more of an annoyance than a benefit.
---
refining lead ore actually is pretty cheap for the ammount of scrap it nets you.  Keep a close eye out for combination Wrenches, as they are both steel and lead.
---
Actually, I was kinda groggy when I wrote that. Maybe it's just good for legendaries. I'm not sure.
---
I'll take it :)
---
So shooting at the ground does more damage then actually aiming at the target with Tesla guns? And they have some sort of auto aim thing? I was trying one before and aiming directly at enemies and the damage was kind of pitiful, though I didn’t have any perks to increase rifle or energy gun damage but it still seemed especially low. If it does some kind of auto aim or something though it could be really good against scorchbeasts I can never seem to hit them when they’re flying 
---
I laughed at this comment for WAYYYY too long
---
Thanks all for your answers!
---
My granddad used to herd tiggers out West in the 19th Century until there was only one left and he was sent to die in captivity in some sort of preserve for talking animals. 
---
Looks like an episode of Hoarders. 😂
---
Why not?
---
I’m happy that they have continued to support the game, and I am excited for the new vaults.
---
Mate I just got a 7 day ban on here for putting up a GT in a negative message classed as insight into a witch hunt best to remove the GT from the message.
---
For me it's a nice way to unwind after work. I've met so many cool and err different people haha but almost entirely good experiences
---
Oof. I scrapped 2 t-60 calibrated shocks the same way. Found them in like two hours, and poof, they were gone.
---
You've stretched this into attempting to evaluate the source of the information rather than the information. From red herring to your own ad hominem you have utterly failed yourself.
---
You can attempt to say I'm being sacrosanct about my own intelligence while deferring that ultimately you brought us here. In other words, like the hazmat suit, no shortcoming of your own brought you here therefore it is someone else's fault.
---
Really cute.
---
It is in the game, here's me wearing it: https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/5/5f/MarineArmor.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/227?cb=20190111172641
---
I've actually submitted it to the wiki btw since the previous screenshot was showing a guy wearing the tactical helmet instead.
---
If you want to see the helmet in the game add me on discord Bungo#5434
---
Also, mass effect was dumped by EA, who is pretty quick to overreact to things like this. They are infamous by their tendency to kill studios at the first sign of a flop. Bioware wants to revive the franchise, and probably they would had tried to keep Andromeda alive and updated if EA gave them the chance.
---
lol i'm running around with a 120cap bounty cause of this crap
---
Harpers Ferry, Graham, Watauga.
---
Then don’t involve yourself and start insulting people online over some “trash” 
---
I love fallout so i knew i was going to play it no matter how fucky it was
---
The water pump is super slow, though. If you setup camp near a stream or river or other decent body of water, you can just spam the square button and collect 50 in less than a minute. 
---
Hey my dude, take the Gamertag out as AnonThree stated. It's breaking Rule 9 my dude.
---
I have a level 25 2 shot single action. Still use it at level 60. Sucks at 6 shots and slow reload but it's the best thing I've found. My main has some nice legendary heavys but I checked after the patch and he still gets stretchy after exiting power armor : (
---
sell , 10 caps for useful bobblehead
---
You tubers aren't special they break the rus ban em they give you evidence of them doing so? Even easier 
---
No. My CAMP isn't close to it. It's the \*closest\* vendor to my CAMP so I'm there frequently and something that I notice frequently becasue of it. I'm suggesting the change becasue it's annoying to have the dialogue and countdown clicker for the event pop in and out when trying to sell items at that vendor and probably annoys others as well. 
---
I just did a bit more testing with it, it seems like the only thing that resets it is storing it away. Mine stays fixed even after I switch weapons, turn the game off, hop servers, and even after coming back from a few days of not playing
---
Along the same lines, I'm a little tired of hopping out of my power armor when I try to invite someone to a group (though I guess that could be resolved by changing some key bindings?)
---
You lost me on that one bro lol. 
---
You could try setting task manager to always be on top. That way it will always be in the foreground when you hit Ctrl shift Escape. From there you can use the arrow keys to move down the list of programs to fall out and hit the delete key to terminate it. I've had to do it this way multiple times because something about the game still running pull screen bounds my mouse cursor and I can't click on the task manager.
---
2 Shot isn't exactly 'double damage'. It adds the base damage to your modified weapon damage.
---
For example (I'm making #'s up): Your rifle does 100 damage. Your rifle mods raise it to 135 damage. With the 2 shot version, you'll shoot 135+100 = 235 damage, not 135x2=270.
---
I don't know anything about Furious other than it adds \~15% per consecutive shot and caps out at some point. Depending on if it increases based on modified weapon damage instead of base damage, it could do more DPS than a 2 shot.
---
2 shot is just so efficient and easy.
---
I feel your pain. I too am a bobblehead and magazine hoarder.  
---
... that and mini nukes, sadly. I need to figure out a good way/place to use those.
---
Pretty much.  Want to see what happens when you DO have one on.  Maybe additional quest?  Supplies given? 
---
Started recently for me and two of four characters seem to be getting hungrier and thirstier than normal. Two don't have speed Demon
---
I’ve encountered him several times in the cranberry bog near the exit of the glassed caverns. 
---
How about sending it to Bethesda insane if sharing it in the internet for profit? 
---
But then rage 2 has a Lower budget :P this game took many assets and copy/pasted them over, for Bethesda this was a “low budget” game so to speak probably for extra cash to throw into rage 2 or the elder scrolls 6 
---
Yup, I've triggered the event enough I want to see what happens if a responder interacts.
---
I think your confusing the Chinese assault rifle with the regular assault rifle R91.
---
I was in whitesprings with some people, eventually we grouped up. Now we play together everyday and it’s awesome! 
---
Dude remove his gt it WILL get you banned
---
Wow what revolutionary.
---
Yeah, Blackwater Falls is a pretty big one to miss. If the F076 map correlates at all to the real life one (obviously not to scale) then they should be far to the NE in the mire I think. Maybe I'll mosey up there and see what I can find.
---
I paid for the pre-order, 60 bucks or w/e it was.
---
Oh I’m sure they weren’t just sitting at the studio saying everything is great, but the pseudo-BETA exposed some serious issues that weren’t addressed in addition to whatever the devs may have been working on. What I’m trying to present is that this was Bethesda’s wake up call that forcing a flawed release is unacceptable. 
---
Imagine if they had said oh shit this BETA was a disasterin addition to our own issues, we need to pushback release. anyone in the BETA would have understood the rationale. And all the hate this game has received post launch would likely have been significantly less. 
---
My camp budget just shuddered.
---
you cant scrap legendary items, which is a lot of whats being duped. this also wouldnt mean much for all the scrap being duped.
---
And I get that some of these things might not be what someone wants to do in a game. They like getting gear and killing things for better gear so they can kill faster and quicker, so they can collect more gear, and play the odds that after killing the SBQ  a hundred times they will get the best weapon in the game. 
---
The thing I find is they are playing a game where that's not the main concept behind it. It's actually a small part of the game. 
---
How much you wanna bet that every Settler there would just happen to be dead by the time the player discovers that location.
---
Except, you know, they, themselves, decided to release a buggy, broken game. And that's being generous. The game still isnt even stable enough to warrant a beta title, let alone a full release. 
---
Damn. Everybody seems much luckier than I. 😭
---
One always spawns behind a broken pipe in the reactor room of any missile silo 
---
Completely agree wit this. I don't think 100% of the server stability issues can be blamed on "objects in the world". It seems like this has become a defacto cop out, not even on Bethesda's part, but our own to say that dupers are the primary reason for server issues.
---
I don’t like this idea, you shouldn’t be able to be a jack off all trades. Allows for too many shady encounters. See a dude with a huge bounty? Oh let’s just ditch all of our cards and become elite sniper. Oh it’s time for a nuke? Let’s spec into nuke survivabilty. No thanks.
---
It is a good list, but a question regarding
---
&gt;1) If your a guns user, mining will solve all your ammunition problems. Hornwright Testing Site #3, Abandoned Mine Shaft 5, and Lucky Hole mine will give you so much Lead and Steel ore that you'll be swimming in ammunition. In my case I have 22,000 .50 cal and 9,500 .308 rounds.
---
Where are you getting the loads of acid, especially since they fixed the bulk acid bug?
---
Not so much a pain to keep stocked as a pain to find them when you need them. Now you’ll need them when you start nodding endgame weapons and armor and PA. 
---
300 does sound a bit high unless your seriously into upgrades and mod everything you find. 
---
I’d be comfortable halving that number though. 
---
As a matter of fact I know just the guy you can donate your excess supplies to ;) 
---
Maybe on PC. Maybe after next week’s console patch. But for now, I still get one or two crashes or disconnections per night on PS4 Pro. 
---
Nicely done OP, I experienced this once and it was awful, I went downstairs only to be bombarded by turrets, so I kept closing the doors .. now I try not to lead the enemies downstairs and away from the back of the building .. how do you level it, just mini nuke it ?
---
Don’t shoot them back
---
The plan you need is Advanced power connections
---
Ok guys now dont do this in game because its cheating and could get you banned but step one......
---
Don't for get the standard dog!
---
Nah, all of their items and camp are forfeit. Make them pay.
---
Ok but seriously how would the timing on this work? I can’t imagine a scenario where you need help and it isn’t an emergency. So I’m the middle of this emergency, you’re going to switch weapons, off the weapon that is presumably the only thing slowing down whatever beast is causing the emergency, and fire a flare. Someone else just happens to be looking at their map at this point and decides to help, so they fast travel to you. That’s going to take at least a minute for them to execute. Are you still alive at this point? Because if so your emergency probably wasn’t that bad and you’ve handled it. 
---
I just don’t see this ever panning out in game. I think using flares to indicate you’re doing a nearby event, alerting other players to join, that could be cool. But as far as making actual use of the flare gun weapon, I don’t see it ever happening. 
---
I know I took that workshop and left it last night once it was time to defend it. I’m level 49 so these spawns sound like what would pop for me
---
Its not greifing. Its part of the game.
---
Fight them or server hop like a bitch.
---
Lever action shotgun and battle rifle
---
Ye
---
I can get well over 20 if i felt the desire. 
---
I got my T-60 jet pack plan last night just from luck, so woooooooo! Extra perfect because my T-60 seems to be my favorite set so far.
---
It could be anything, from a weird exploit/glitch to extreme lag. 
---
I found my first explosive weapons at lvl 90 after 100's of legendaries. It's a fkn Gatling plasma that I can't is because it breaks after a few reloads. 
---
Honestly its going to get to the point where i dont really think about pvp any more just how to fuck over a high level that wants to pvp me cause they are lazy. iven been building a low level with legendary equipment so i can switch to that toon when i need to screw with them. Get the PvE/PvP side so worked up over wondering if its a trap it just stops happening. 
---
Because its always gonna be a trap. 
---
I’ll have to disagree. The way I see it they were on a VERY crunched schedule. From what I can remember off the top of my head from the noclip documentary is that they said for 76 to work they had to rebuild the engine from the ground up. Not only that, but they had to build a world add new textures, new effects, and a totally new concept for the game. They had to write lore, journal entries, holotapes, etc all while still working on Fallout 4. Not to mention they overlap projects. While working on 4 and 76 they’re also probably working on Starfield and Elder Scrolls. This is all between 2015 and 2018. These games take time and I think these guys were pressured by corporate. I think what happened is corporate saw two money black holes when BGS opened two new studios. Corporate wanted money and fast, so corporate pushed the release. These guys working there are people with bosses and impossible deadlines. They always cared but there’s not much they can do when their bosses are pressuring for a release. It’s like taking a timed exam you know all the answers to but not nearly enough time to answer them all. So they rushed what they could get and made mistakes. I think their plan was to be this active all along it’s just now they have this Fallout (zing) to deal with. 
---
Using any drugs? have any diseases? both can affect thirst. 
---
Popping some rad-x really drains the water. 
---
Yeah I refill my quad lever action sooo fast lol. I've noticed thirst going faster too, but not THAT faster. Class freak is mandatory honestly
---
You do not need a perk to craft armour. You just have to find a plan. The ultralight plan is a mod that you add to created armour. You have to find a plan for limbs, legs, and chest for the particular armour set you want.
---
To be fair I deal with Huntington enough in real life to tell you it could never be as terrifying in game as irl
---
Wishful thinking. They spent a good chunk of time giving us what we got.
---
I doubt they'll say fuck it and toss that type of respec out the window.
---
Its weird in this game as the longevity for alot of ppl has been making alts and beelining the gear to use that build.
---
I mean,  It makes sense since you don't wear armor in power armor.  If I have 4 deep pockets pieces of armor (+40 carry weight) then removing that and buffing my str (5/increase in str) then my carry weight will go down unless you were able to gain 8 str in the PA. 
---
Just trying to help, but do you have task manger set to always be on top? Its turned off by default in windows 10.
---
Trying what? 
---
To fix bugs and issues that should never have been there from the start?
---
The fact this shit gets upvoted to the top spot here just shows how fucking crazy most people here are. 
---
It's not just you. 
---
The magazines ...stuff them under your mattress! 
---
The bobbleheads too but way too lumpy so they have to go!
---
Judging by the top level comments, no, most people dont  agree at all lol
---
I can see your point, perhaps the rarest of power armor mods should be behind events or enemies. I just think that there should be a clear way to get stuff: Like I want X, then I should do Y, and not be dependent on rng. 
---
I also agree with the reward pool being less than satisfying, hence why I'm saving up all my T60 MAS plans to document that we need a change in the drop rate. 
---
Nope use them.  Caps are easy to get.  There's an ATOM bonus for using all Bobble heads not finding them.
---
Flare gun can’t spawn with legendary effects, just like the syringer and chainsaw.
---
Where to find them? I've checked harpers ferry and watoga, and nothing at either place.
---
If it's off by default, it's probably still off. I'll check when I get home, thank you!
---
Paid 60$ to beta test a game that will be f2p by the time its fixed
---
Yes man. This would be great, a better payoff to those quests at least. 
---
High five man! Feels great doesn't it? Let us take flight in the glorious T-60!
---
And the point of radiation resistance on regular armor is what? I tested earlier that even with 2.7k radiation resistance from armor and meds you still take 7 rad/s in nuke blast zones. Meanwhile even the worst power armor with no meds active takes only ~2 rad/s.
---
So don't get your hopes up.
---
Since the patch it all shows as equipped though, whereas before it would unequip, so I was hopeful something changed but alas...
---
Yes! Thanks--I edited that tidbit in. 
---
You know ,it's funny, but I didn't know until yesterday that I kept contracting Swamp Itch from sleeping on nasty sleeping bags. I read it on one of the PSAs that scroll across while the game is loading. That's one of my gripes about all the Fallout games: unless you read it online, or in one of the Prima books, how would you ever know all these little details, especially if you don't pay attention to the loading screens? 
---
It definitely gets better once you get to learn the mechanics ... as soon as you start growing crops at your camp, make soup and live on that for a while. Get the water purifiers at Camp McClintock, start making water. Or quite honestly just got to a river and grab a ton of dirty water, go to a stove/fire camp and make boiled water, just drink boiled water until you can get your juices and purified water going. It's still a grind to keep fed and hydrated, just gets a little easier ..
---
I'm in the UK so it only cost me £40 (dropped to £25 couple days later)
---
It appears to be consuming you , maybe it's best to put it down to a learning curve cut losses and let it be.
---
No point being stressed/annoyed etc it's just a game (yes I understand you paid money earned for it)
---
But we buy and play games for an experience unfortunately yours has only be a bad one.
---
Well, the time scale in the game is roughly 20 to 1. So, you are getting a drink every 200 odd minutes. is it really crazy to take a drink every 3.5 hours?
---
My camp is there too. Halfway up the cliff. 
---
Theres a pumpkin patch underneath. For pies.
---
Yeah my plan is to go through the whole map one day and read everything I've been rushing through mostly 
---
I'll try to get 2k caps but only have 1500 now.. I'll be on around 3pm est 
---
Lol that many tries. This game is ridiculous. Nothing should be that rare. 
---
You can look for the diamond on the map to tell you were to go
---
PC Patch 10.01.19
---
When you get a mutation or lose a mutation, you do not get a message about it.
---
Seems the loading is abit faster, but i has a weird interaction when you are about to log in to the area, it shows you the area, then back to loadingscreen again, then back to the game.
---
just make sure to learn the generator plan you get from the event right away, just in case it actually detects what plans you do/don't know. 
---
"If you get robbed when you don't lock your house it's your fault"
---
"I'm not victim blaming"
---
Hmm.
---
I have videos of it should I post?
---
Yeah... almost to what should have been acceptable for launch. Unfortunately, those issues have created a slew of balance and economy issues that are going to require even more drastic changes to resolve. 
---
Two shot on shotguns means one more pellet :-/
---
By whitesprings there is a road that passes the mine and keeps going till some cabins and across from the cabins is a raised are with trees surrounding it with a flat area and a pond that was my first real base. at the cabins honeybeasts, yau goai or radscorpions spawn often
---
That's a possibility.  But there is also the issue of missing their own deadline and getting hate for that.  And then also trying to bank on the Christmas shopping season.   There would have been less incentive to release the game in February.   Either way, it looks like Bethesda put themselves into a no win position. 
---
People like OP are the reason publishers will continue releasing buggy/unfinished garbage.
---
They aren't all duped but if you legit found a tse weapon no way you'd throw it in the vendor.
---
Are you being serious?
---
I have learnt 101 food recipes and 32 drinks recipes.  The ones missing from your list that are on mine:
---
MegaSloth Mushroom Soup: Boiled Water; MegaSloth Mushroom; Wood.  RADS: 2, HP: 30, Food: 10%, Water: 15%.
---
Smoked Scorchbeast Lung: ScorchBeast lung; Wood.  RADS: 4; HP: 200, Food: 25%, AG 3.
---
Sugar: Snaptail Reed, Wood.  RADS: 2, AP 60, Food: 1%.
---
Race you to complete!
---
I'm confident that they will address all the major issues, and really bring alot of QoL updates. The game has so much potential and I'm excited to see where it is a few months from now. I've been playing every day since release and although I'm only on lvl 78, I'm enjoying every minute.
---
Scout armor has the potential but until we start seeing legendary pieces drop besides the chest piece from the main quest combat armor is still the best.
---
There are acid pools all over the place that you can build a camp on. Plus plenty of junk out there to scrap if you are looking for it
---
You need to spend extra points for mutations, and it can be a pain to farm for just the right combonation of mutations. In addition, many mutations are pointless in certain builds, so they don’t add to many benefits.
---
PvP isn't that bad I killed a level 50 with my automatic pipe rifle at level 10 you just have to suck or not have an advantage like power armor 
---
Oh okay. Thank you! Guess I’ll be hunting some marine armor plans. Or which is better, marine or combat? 
---
I just want my first set, not being too picky. So if I show up there and it isn't on the screen I have to wait 24 hours? 
---
That's correct.
---
Ultra light is a mod of combat armor itself.
---
I would prefer furious explosive and a auto receiver. 
---
Maybe you just shouldn't play survival games then? 
---
Inventory management is kind of a thing with them.
---
Just built 25 mininukes and loaded them into my Daisycutter for easy dispersion.
---
My TSE shotgun is probably a way better solution to these pests, but those mushroom clouds just look too damn good!
---
I just sell the bobbleheads and use the magazines right away (until I get the achievement).
---
Which is an entirely different problem in it's own...lack of end game content.
---
Because it is in almost every game, in morrowind ([https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Test\_Cells](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Test_Cells)), oblivion ([https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Interior\_Test\_Cells](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Interior_Test_Cells)), Fallout 3 ([http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout\_3\_test\_cells](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_3_test_cells)) and more (easy to google them)... Fallout 76 is nothing more than Fallout 4 made to comunicate over internet with server, which holds save files. Also that is why there are so many problems.
---
The cause of the duping is the poor handling of save-game data. Imagine if you had a multiplayer mod for Fallout 4.. for the sake of example, let's call it Fallout 76 or something. Now lets say that multiplayer mod worked like Diablo 1&amp;2 did on open servers, where no change was made between how the single player game handled your character's saved game files and how it was handled in multiplayer. You join a multiplayer game and drop all of your stuff on the ground. Then you make it so your game can't save in its current state somehow. Exit the game and reenter the same multiplayer game with your character having been unchanged during the last session. Your items are all in your inventory still, but it's multiplayer, and the server has kept all of the items you dropped earlier on the ground. This is basically what happens here, with the only difference being that the save files are stored on the servers, which eliminates the much easier methods life just copying your save file and restoring it, or making them read-only.
---
The best solution would be to better handle a character's saved data.. right now it is on a 5 minute auto-save, and also saves when you fast travel, sleep, log out, or make progress on a quest.
---
Second to that, they could ensure that the process of saving the character's data can't be corrupted. This is the direction Bethesda appears to be trying to go, but poorly. The saving is being corrupted by having more than 300 or more freshly crafted and identical(stacked) weapons in your inventory when the auto-save rolls around. Bethesda's attempt at patching this was to make it so you couldn't craft any more of the weapon if you already had 255 of them in your inventory. So now you craft 255 of them, drop those on the ground, craft 45+ more, then pick up the rest. Even if they do manage to piddle-patch their way around people corrupting the save process using this method, there are no doubt many more way to do so. So, there is not a lot of hope for the economy ever being in an acceptable state, even if they did somehow mitigate or eliminate the current damage. As long as the game saves your progress like a single player game... there's always going to be another dupe around the corner.
---
I haven't played the game in weeks, and tbh, I probably won't again for months. I'll let you guys continue to deal with the rocky experience and help them improve it. I was already at my wit's end before, and it'll be a while before I give it another chance.
---
The problem lies in the fact it's bethesda. They have made some of my favorite games of all time, and I play fo76 daily. But it doesn't excuse them from criticism, and the slow turnaround of bug fixes is really straining people's patience with the game. I want this game to succeed, but they should have taken another year to polish this game before release. And honestly Angry Joe has good points, let's not turn into the star citizen community where we get excited for the most minor of fixes and ignore all of the controversy with deflection.
---
Ill upload tonight I went to work 
---
They're banning the problem children.    
---
Also, this one might be one to come back to in a month.  
---
There are a few titles releasing in jan/feb that people have been waiting for, it might pull all the casuals.
---
Then you can have the game the way you want.  
---
Beth really should just implement PVE servers.
---
&gt; owns the right to ban anyone for any reason at any time for a breach of tos
---
It's cute that everyone here thinks the ToS carries anymore weight than a bundle of used toilet paper but the reality is not even the people giving the greenlight to ban have read the ToS let alone actually consider it in their decisions other than shrugging thinking "In there somewhere^pprobably "
---
You can already reinvest your special points after level 50. Should allow for any tweaks you need to make.
---
I did this. Dont remember the result. I’ll have to try it again and pay attention ... I was too busy trying to Power Up Poseidon last timr
---
Yeah but they can kill you eventually. If you’re at a workbench, or building a camp, or have do to something at a comp for a quest, etc.....
---
*In bold, as well!*
---
please please tell me. 1: your on xbox 2: you have T60 reactive plates. because im hitting 50 total server jumps now with no luck
---
Agreed better to wait til lvl 50, not to mention once you mod the weapon it's even better.
---
If you get in to situation like that again and want a easy way out, just log out and log in. The game puts you into a different server and there wont probably be 2 scorchbeasts after you. 
---
What a luck, but my CAMP was almost there and those beasts destroyed it. 
---
This right here is correct. Bethesda has dug themselves so deep, anything positive they do will be highly appreciable. This doesn't mean the company is reformed.
---
I know...and that's not what I'm suggesting...
---
There is no chance to fight tse in pvp
---
The only way to fight them is to stimpack before they do damage, then deal more damage back (with a tse) alternatively you can go in close quarters where they can't really use tse. 
---
As for building workshops..... personal experience is that building workshops up is useless.. You never keep what you've built and like you said it can be griefed. If you claim a workshop be ready for someone to claim it to tp to you and pvp, you get a warning top left when it happens. A good combo of jet pack and marsupial is good for pvp tse combat. Oh and if you choose to revenge them or initiate combat they can destroy your whole base without penalty. My personal suggestion is saving up for a tse it's around 4k on the market and an easy solution to fight the bullies. 
---
100% agree, I encourage people to keep asking on Twitter for more stash and just keep it up until they give it to us so it is not forgotten ..
---
You would get so much porn. Seriously 
---
True. I suspect the next content update is going to give us more avenues to the gear we can get now.
---
No change in the power curve.
---
That's just me though.
---
Same. If I play I can expect about a crash per hour or so. On the original XBONE
---
Why did they make so many trash "legendaries" is what I want to know.
---
Thank you for clearing this up for me. This would be my first time crafting armor and that makes me regret selling some marine armor I got off a scorchbeast beast earlier haha
---
And Atlas is in Early Access so there's that
---
Make it 5k caps and limit to once per 20 hours
---
Todd said before the game was released, that there would and should be some tension when a player stumbles into another player. 
---
That is what I want. I want to be on my guard for other players as well as NPC mobs. I don't want to feel safe in a nuclear wasteland in between monuments on the map where mobs are obviously waiting for you. I feel way too safe walking from town to another. 
---
I don't care if it's a level 235 player who one-shots me. I don't think players should feel safe when not near towns in a survival game in a nuclear post-apocalypse wasteland.
---
https://youtu.be/4PzGT5BEBGg
---
Good place to get marine. Also I like marine over combat. 
---
Also, does of 10mm SMG is classified as a rifle, does that mean Guerilla only applies to the 10mm auto pistol? A whole perk tree for one variant of one gun?
---
D'awww... shucks.
---
You can, but unfortunately, few of the paints look alright together. 
---
If its not in the server you're in you'll have to server hop to another server and check again and so on and so on.
---
Listen, I'm just mad I can't find like any of the clothes I'm looking for. And some just dont even work correctly. 
---
You can also buy the pieces from people who can craft them
---
Also going to add that if you want to do workshops then spam lvl 1 turrets that's all you need. Teleporting to the workshop to defend it also usually gives you a 3 star legendary at the end of the waves 
---
It’s a decent game, around a 7.5/10 in my opinion, I’d recommend it if your bored.
---
did not even think about that, that's fckn hilarious, rofl
---
Like he said, did 4,5 hours jumping, and then did "patrol duty" 3 times and score
---
Omg 22k 50cal? duper!! /s
---
Gotcha, thanks bud
---
They are a random vendor spawn in those locations, so you may have to visit them a few times from the plans to show up. 
---
It must be one of Delbert's recipes.
---
Harpers ferry is your best option just server hop for a while 
---
They need to let me put a silencer on it
---
If they did that they would need to block us from putting our own images into the folder or you would get people flooding the wasteland with the sort of porn you ask your kids to burn in your will. And in less than an hour after the feature is added
---
Idk how I should respond to these news. 
---
On one hand, the youtube content creators made Bethesda aware of the duplication glitches and the workflow to achieve it, so it's unfair to ban them for doing Bethesda a favor, meanwhile leaving the most blatant dupers untouched. 
---
On the other hand, burn dupers burn.
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-76-players-find-human-npc-and-unreleased-items-in-secret-dev-room/
---
Huh, i guess you don't know what your talking about.
---
First Bethesda game? 
---
How much do you want for it?
---
I don't see a learning curve here, not sure what you are talking about. It's not so much about the money as I won't support this kind of gaming industry anymore.
---
Vendors take them for around 23-25 as I’ve seen.
---
But its all thats needed...
---
*spoiler alert*
---
Now you know what got the rest of Appalacia killed too.
---
I thought I had seen a post on here at one time saying that with certain attachments the 10mm was getting buffed from auto rifle and auto pistol perks, similar to how pipe weapons are.  Easy way to test it would be to take a character, equip the 10mm and then throw perks on and off to see.  I would love to read a well done write up on it.
---
Go none PA then. Yes,it's harder at times but PA makes the game stupid easy.
---
I've been farming whitesprings to hit 50 so i can do my quests and on my none melee build i 1 shot level 68 ghouls with a melee weapon in PA.
---
Zero melee perks
---
as soon as i noticed how much they weigh, i just never carried more than 20 at a time, and i've been just finenever needed more than that. i only break 1 or 2, even on level 3 locks, and i dont even do it that much to be that good at it.
---
i am happy for those that need more though.
---
Or just make it like the Mystery quest line items that you can recycle and upgrade every 10 levels.
---
There's no point in following a reviewer if their reviews don't match with your own experiences. You watch a reviewer to find out whether or not you should try a game, if the reviewer says it sucks, but you think it is fun, you should probably stop listening or following that reviewers suggestion. It isn't that hard of a concept to grasp. 
---
Pipe pistol, laser pistol, and plasma pistol with automatic receivers as well. In theory.
---
Exactly what i've been thinking lately, i don't think it should be allowed to change on the fly in combat though.
---
Well I die all the time so I can help with the revives lol add me if you'd like txcowboy69
---
Yea and thanks for the increased server instability , increased rate of bugs appearing (from 5 minutes to 2)  and increased rate of disconnects and server crashed.*clap**clap*
---
Na man game sucks
---
Bugs and stuff.
---
Stop enjoying yourself.
---
Yesterday I server hopped at mama dolces food factory a dozen times in a row to get the booby trapped power armor.  I ended up seeing it 8/12 times and each time I took the armor, scrapped what I did not want, and kept what I did for my personal power armor.
---
I did the same at the Belching Belly ( I think that is the name) down south at the fire breathers final exam area.  Also hopping and getting multiple power armor spawns. 
---
They did not seem to be locked behind a 24 hour respawn for me.  Just RNG chances at hopping. 
---
Nah I'm just tired of seing either mindless ghouls or obvious trolls ruining it for everyone else.
---
Maybe i should start a "base busters" anti-griefer service? Hmmmm!
---
Workshops essentially enable you for full PvP at the moment, and griefers are starting to realise that. Best you can do is wall in the workshop bench, and then they at least get wanted.
---
I too think photo mode is an under rated thing in the game.  I love that it shows my photos during loading.
---
I also play 100% solo. Its hit and miss for me, but I dont get to run home every day from work to play- shift work and being a dad eat up my days. My character is still under LVL 20, and the game has become frustrating to log into and play for 3-4 hours a week- always getting over run by higher level enemies due to proximity to higher level players, and I kind of want to just play the game as I did with FO3, FO4 and NV. I dont want to spend half of my time playing just scrapping and building items as I just dont get a lot of time to play. Went back to playing Far Cry 5 (still havent beaten it either)since I can just run the missions and the story line and feel like I did something productive with my time. 
---
Hey man, fake or not, let it scare would-be dupers. As far as I'm concerned, anyone with an "excessively high" number of items should get to dropping like it's hot. I sure wouldn't risk it on the off chance it's real. All that duping for naught...
---
Instead of releasing a broken game.. Here's a thought don't release a broken game. Delay it. Get it right. 
---
Praising them for doing what they should have done from them beginning is silly.
---
The fact that i got a legit one makes me feel sad. I mean... everyone who sees it will make an assumption about my ethics, but I want people to say “nice gun” instead. 
---
I wish it was a hunting rifle instead though. I love the sound and feel of my .50 cal rifle. 
---
How is it intelligent when you get no xp or loot? That many turrets are not going to give anyone a chance to get any. 
---
&gt;"Your Honor and members of the Jury: In my opening statement, I would like to detail what occurred and how it violated my clients terms of service. The same terms of service, the defendant agreed to in order to play the game my client created and released.

&gt;For the context of this trial, The word Exploit is defined in Cambridge Dictionary as : https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/exploit

&gt;"to use someone or something unfairly for your own advantage"

&gt;My client sold the intellectual property created by my client, on Ebay for $3.99 a piece. Here is a copy of one of the webpages. (Edit: my comment was banned because I posted an actual Ebay link to a 2 shot explosive handmade rifle, if you want a reference, please just go to Ebay and search " Two Shot Explosive " )  
---
&gt;By exploiting a glitch in programming code, the defendant, knowingly created hundreds or more of the item listed here, for his own personal gain. This was a blatant infringement on my clients intellectual property and copyrights. My client never intended to allow their in game items to be duplicated in this manor. If the original intent of the program was to allow players to "dupe" these items they would have allowed for an ingame mechanic to duplicate these items.  
---
&gt;By directly benefiting from this glitch in gaming code, the defendant has broken copy right laws, and infringed on my client, and the other players, of each and every server the defendant logged into.
---
The only reason I keep a set of power armor is for nukes. I hate it more for that reason. Have a perfect build without it, but no perks to survive a nuke without burning resources.
---
I believe I lost my sanity after 400 tries, never before has a game siphoned out that many hours of not actually playing the game from me. Can't say it enough though, I'm just glad it's over.
---
They're both awful.
---
The first sentence in your stupid comment was the most incorrect thing written in a comment here all day. Congrats. 
---
Sugar is a recipe, it gives 60 AP.  It uses snaptail reed and wood.
---
I'd like to add to this:
---
Frustrated with how often you need to repair your gear? Change up your playstyle. Utilizing stealth, sneak attacks, perks, semi automatic weapons etc. are going to dramatically reduce the amount of materials you run through repairing your gear, and thus time you spend collecting said materials.
---
If you are the type to stand around face tanking every mob while spamming stimpaks with your automatic weapon spraying wildly, you are going to need to repair your gear more often.
---
This might be the fastest way to kill enemies, but is it really worth it if you need to spend so much time and effort maintaining your gear?
---
Don't just get mad and complain about the balance of the game, there are tons of tools you can use to become more efficient.
---
I carry two sets of PA. Yes, 20 lbs outbof armor covered by my Deep Pocketed Armor.
---
T-60 for Combat (cheaper repairs)
---
Excavator for hauling (415 lb capacity)
---
Much easier in my convoluted mind.
---
Acid can be had from farming Yaoi Guai, bugs (their parts yield acid), wendigos (teeth are acid), or snally gasters.  Or taking over the Hemlock Holes Workshop with a camp on the golf course giving you a total of four acid extractors.
---
This isnt greifing dude. Its a game mechanic. I hunt down people at their base all the time and do what those people did. 
---
This is the game you bought. Its not greifing. Play something else if you are "fuming".
---
You have plenty of tools to not engage with us: pacifist, server hopping like a bitch, etc. 
---
Boo hoo it cost you 50 wood, 50 steel and 5 assorted other junk to rebuild. 
---
Quit crying like a bitch. This is a pvp game. Get used to it.
---
Exactly, depending on perks and other buffs, you can get a pretty penny from them. They still hold a higher value than that to me though, just not sure what it is haha

I left as Crack was starting to wind down and opiates were starting to wind up.

Keep in mind banked levels do not let you bypass kennel requirements.

Ie: you're level 45, you want a perk that unlocks at 45 but you have 5 saved levels. You won't see that perk till you spend those levels

If you interact with the Eyebot, he says something like 'scanning, responder uniform not detected' and ignores you.  So it looks like in a responder outfit you should get something else.

My 10mm SMG is Explosive exterminator. Call me the Orkin man.

Also much fewer players roaming about the grounds imo

Scorched to the left of me

Ghouls to my right

Stuck in the middle napping

That was the main reason i started taking them. As much as I miss the rotating 3d model, I love seeing the pictures I take even more
---
You made my day, thank you
---
Not to mention watched other players pay half price after waiting a couple days after launch. 
---
It still happens frequently on PC. Damn dupers and pocketed armor exploiters just ruining everything.

Lol.
---
"A miracle of development for the franchise."Can't believe people are so stupid they call this broken game that.I mean its playable but definetly sjit and full with bugs , instability , boredom , loneliness and headaches.
---
You can also report it to Bethesda in the support tab on their website. Give them a link to the video as well. Reminds me of the good ol' "lag switches" that people used in Call of Duty
---
Ok great! Why are you even here?
---
If you think this is immersive, try Red Dead Redemption 2!
---
You're right. Didn't think of those!
---
Both Minecraft and Ark have a far heavier emphasis on building bases. Its fairly Central to the entire game play. 
---
Where as a camp in FO is entirely optional. 
---
I get that smaller storage may impact some people's enjoyment of the game. Then maybe the game isn't their cup of tea. Just because some players want it, doesn't mean it should be, nor that it's good for the game. 
---
People just want the easy way. Games that don't force you to make difficult choices are boring. Part of survival games appeal are those times where you have to decide between the new shiny thing, and some building junk you need.
---
Don't give them a free pass for a complete f*****-up game.
---
Well with every update to this game it makes one step forward and 3 steps back.
---
If you want to make marine armour, the plans spawn in harpers ferry. When you fast travel to it, look for the hole in the wall (left of train cars). You’ll see a bunch of display cases. Look in those and go up to 2nd and 3rd level of that building.
---
I’ve unintentionally done the Grafton day event like 5 times. It’s so annoying. 
---
Hoping for the best moving forward!
---
TB would have called FO76 absolute trash just like every other reviewer.
---
There's no limb dismemberment on PS4 for certain enemies though and whenever you shoot a minimum it goes to 15 FPS. 
---
Np.
---
A common method ppl do is get the plan and create a bunch of low level pieces to break down for mods.
---
That's more common for guns that are more rare.
---
No endgame... Fix that, game is done after LVL 60... There is litterly no reason to play once you beat the man story 
---
Same, on the FO4 comment. I’d love it if it could work like tht here too, but suspect “technical limitations” would crop up. I’d rather have game and server stability than glowing containers, if I have to choose.
---
Aye, it's better no doubt, but I hoped for materials like leather or metal it would just be gone fullstop
---
Well yea with every update the game makes 1 step fforward and 3 steps back.
---
Ok gamer
---
Yes, scoured all buildings in the indicated zone, it's just screwed..plenty of SMs turn up though...
---
If no one else has one or is doing one hit me up next week, I just deleted my plumber build to make way for something new and might be willing to dive into this and get it up to speed in a couple evenings for full testing.
---
Could be a little of both.... They are definitely going to open Vaults as DLC and they could even include the aforementioned underground tunnels to get to said area. 
---
FWIW the energy ones are kinda.....meh! So it is easy to forget them.
---
why do we have to be responsible for bethesda's fuck ups, they added that to a multiplayer game, not our fault really.
---
Megasloth Mushroom Soup? That increases your Critical Damage by 20%. It's a pretty rare drop from them though. Usually they just drop the Megasloth Meat and Claws.
---
Sure crashing 2-3 times an hour is totally playable lol. Keep going fanboy
---
I know about the pools, the extractors are way to slow for the product they produce. I usually try to farm Abraxo Industrial cleaner since it gives so much acid per box. 
---
I just wanted to know if OP had another farming spot specifically for quicker acid farming like the hint for the mines for quick lead. 
---
I would highly recommend you stay away from getting all of them. I have them all except Herbivore and Carnivore. It’s pretty cool but then it doesn’t give you much of a boost with everything adding and subtracting. You only get a few points added here and there but it’s only better if I have someone on a team with me.
---
Can't you cheat it with an I-Beam?
---
Not even remotely true. eBay has been an acceptable platform for selling hacked and duped game items for years now. As long as they're not breaking the law (theyre not), eBay has no reason to take down auctions that they get commissions from.
---
i'll be paying you a visit soon.
---
For low level characters, the "Leader of the Pack" event is bugged. You cannot use the Event icon to travel there but the location closest to it does work. FT to it and then walk up the road a bit and it will trigger.    
---
This event has me getting 3 lower level legendaries every time. The 3 wolf bosses all drop one each. The time limit is short so you need to get all the POIs in the area or you won't make it.    
---
I don't group often but it would make sense to have 1 player travel and then join up since any fast traveling cost caps unless it an owned workshop, CAMP, or group member location.
---
&gt;PvP only servers will devolve into a deathmatch with zero point doing anything else.
---
Most multiplayer games have pvp and pve servers though, and this is not what happens.
---
This only happens on games where pvp is the core mechanic of the game.
---
Nuke zones are different. Its either hazmat or PA for those.
---
Just a fact of life.
---
Radsponge in a group can make it manageable though. 
---
I got my 2500000 lead legitimately!
---
Learning curve of not jumping in and investing in early release games ,  you have tried it with Fallout76 it hasn't worked out for you maybe next time wait for game reviews a month or two after release.
---
I'm not trying to be a dick about it , it's just for you to have to post like this your emotionally involved in it and at the end of the day it's just a game.
---
Relog
---
Have you tried doing the monster mash at watoga high school?
---
Doesn't "All Night Long" just reduce the severity of dehydration/starvation effects when you go below the 25% threshold?
---
oh nice, I will check it out. thanks for the tip
---
Didnt the M79 Grenade launcher get a buff in the recent patch? Like riffle perks now work with it? 
---
No. Magz only refresh. They don't stack.
---
I just like sparking conversation
---
I had to do it 3 times. First you get the large, then wins turbine, then fusion!
---
i have a very strong hate/love relation with this game xD
---
I'm just a hardcorde diehard fallout fun too much to keep it uninstalled
---
No. But it is directly to the event and you join the event instead of fast travel nearby and run to join.
---
&gt;  to hit 50 so i can do my quests 
---
Do do what quests?  Almost no quest content in the game requires you to be any higher than 20 or so.  Even the silos can be soloed in the early 40's.
---
L O L
---
I'm in a glass case of emotion!
---
I really enjoy placing CAMP around a junk mode and just slowly exploring locations around it.  Y'know, playing the game!
---
If your solo, invest in lone wanderer. Otherwise I would recommend blocker, and you should also invest in endurance for cannibal and ghoulish.
---
I was talking about weapons with the legendary effect of exploding bullets.    I agree that the traditional exploding weapons are weak and weigh too much.
---
If I go to a restaurant and order a steak and it comes out wrong I might send it back once, not a dozen times
---
Your blind optimism and acceptance of a game that was blatantly pushed for released in what could be considered an alpha form at best is why they are going to keep selling you garbage, because you keep buying it
---
Yep you can see through walls when loading in after the last patch.
---
\&gt; Fanboy is a pretty childish insult to throw at someone
---
Care to show us what is "mature" about the insults you threw?
---
\&gt; God damn it's painful to deal with entitled gamers. 
---
\&gt; Get some help, man. Seriously, it's a fucking video game. Go outside and experience the real world for a while and maybe you'll learn that being an insufferable idealist makes you and everyone around you completely miserable.
---
\&gt; And dollop of self-righteous condescension to top it all off.
---
I mean no offence. But, glass houses and stones, etc etc. 
---
I just wish the Camden dailies would show up more often.
---
Did I mention Beth anywhere? Did I say that he was the worst youtuber? Don't put words in my posts or learn how to read(pick the one you like more). 
---
I recently joined a guild a few weeks back, but still do a lot of stuff on my own since it seems like most of them just want to do queen or Whitespring runs. It's fun to have options for either solo or co-op, though only one dude in my guild likes to read terminals and listen to holotapes like I do and take my time. 
---
what prevented him from fast travel?
---
Server hopped Morgan town sets, mama dolces warehouse and trainyard.. They weren't guarantee spawns but at level 20 I got all my sets and made some penny too selling the ones I didn't need. Protip power armor chassis instead of singular pieces if you're collecting all your sets 
---
well, thats the thing.  
---
If you have picked it up, you have to wait 24 hours for another CHANCE that it will show up.  They aren't guaranteed.
---
So if you havent picked it up in the last 24 hours, and its not there, join another server.
---
hehe.  you also have to have an exposed dummy house nearby, in full view of your turrets.
---
Its not just a drink though. Its like 7 full waters to quench your thirst. With a punishment for not. I dont drink 7 bottles of water in a day in real life.
---
Certainly! I'll pin this thread and check in!
---
Until tomorrow
---
Oh this wasn't after loading in, this was 30 minutes into my game and it just... stopped loading things in.
---
Keep walking up to random encounter areas
---
as far as im aware, 2mm EC is used only by the Gauss rifle. so it could be a hybrid magazine with ballistic rounds and could contain additional energy required to change up the rail on the rifle it self to fire the round. 
---
I mean after all 2mm would imply the projectile is pretty small and the magazines look slightly larger than a d cell battery. 
---
But for the sake of programming a video game its a flag and were all just talking about lore fluff left up for us to come up with on our own. 
---
I actually got the Fusion generator the first time. I got the Large generator somewhere else. Then we did it so a friend could get a fusion one, and I got the wind. 
---
More importantly, Bethesda as a publisher has undersold many games in a row. They tried to stick to single player games, and, despite what youtubers say, that's not so profitable anymore.  Sure, once in a while a single player game will outsell everything. But if you do plenty of them, like Bethesda, you are trying to corner a dying market. Games like Dishonored 2, who had no bugs or problems, was pure single player, had zero microtransactions, and was critically praised, undersell respective to expectations.   
---
Bethesda publishes games that undersell routinarely. Yes, they got a big bunch of money from FO4 and Skyrim. They also publish Dishonored 2, Prey, or Wolfenstein, which do not sell that well. That's why they tried to put a foothold in multiplayer, with FO76, in my opinion.
---
Yes. And one of it's survival elements is inventory management.
---
Oddly, I’ve just started getting a ton of these on XBox, where the patch hasn’t even hit. Makes me wonder if people have started duping an insane amount of items to sell before they get banned.
---
Is your gamer tag Luis something? 
---
Dude. You just don’t get it.
---
Its bug report feature, if you want the game to improve youd use it, you are clearly a mibile salt factory whenever bethesda is in question so i doubt you understand that many people actually enjoy this game and want it to be improved by using the features they provide.  
---
Add me: liverssssss, I’ll play w/ you tonight and help you out :) level 48 here
---
The mod specifically. Previously for vampire, it only counted the initial swing as a hit. Now that it works, you get a flood of life back while using it. Bloodied is more damage of course but this is very safe with vampire.
---
As I understand it there are still no legendary chainsaws, so it's probably still not worth it.
---
I've drank two beers in a row once (two points of endurance in my build) and got addicted. I just wanted to top up my thirst. 
---
Didn't actually find an addictol for about a week afterwards
---
I just collect 1 of each and then sell or use the spares.
---
The excavator armor lasts *forever*! I'm sitting on 250+ black titanium since I rarely have to repair it. 
---
Good. Work your way down to the scum of the bucket Bethesda.
---
People really should not expect good performance on consoles. My GPU alone costed 1000$. Of course it will run like shit on a console especially with so many interactable objects in the world. On PC i have smooth FPS even when launching mininukes at 50+ robots in Whitesprings. I'm averaging at 85 fps at 1440p.
---
I think we actually agree, because I’m upset at bethesda as a publisher (the corporate side of things) not Bethesda as a developer, I’m sure the people making the game were rushed and they wanted to be able to make a good game but they were being pushed to make it for December
---
I'm level 305 and I've not touched the main quest line (like not even the first overseers camp).. So much to explore
---
oh lol, havent noticed that yet.
---
That's fair, just means we can ignore 99% of the "I am uninstalling" or "quitting the game" posts since they are just venting :)
---
You were nicely rewarded by the RNG gods for sticking around it seems.
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/xOcCi6R
---
Why not? If you can change your perks during combat now, why couldn't you "auto-swap" the same way? Same process just automated like a macro. I change perks mid fight all the time forgetting to take off the reduced travel cost for lone wanderer. 
---
i've gotten the T60 optimized bracers from Phoenix in my 2 weeks of hopping him.
---
The fun.
---
there should be higher levels of scrapper that let you get close to, but not all of, the items you need to rebuild the item you scrapped. 
---
That's not an excuse to not optimize the game
---
Yeah nah people worship the ground it stands on and can take literally 0 criticism of it. 
---
I enjoyed it too. Played it for many many hours. Still my least favorite fallout title though. I get why you say it's more RPG like and stuff, but honestly the rest of the game was lackluster enough to make the extra 4 dialogue options not feel as good as it could be. 
---
The hivemind took a few nostalgic passionate peoples views and made it into a religion.
---
I would like to see them add my old hometown, still don't understand how they left out Huntington, it's second largest city in the state.  I keep my camp where Huntington should be on the map. But if they ever do add it, they'll do something crazy like stick it up in the north east. It'll be as out of place as Beckley is. They really should rename Beckley to Logan. 
---
Yes, I think I've only seen one legendary in that event so far, probably only done it 3 or 4 times though.
---
Yeah lmao, I loaded into flatwoods and started walking north and it was all fine at first, but.. then things that I remembered being there just.. weren't.  It was rather spooky, I was getting shot/smacked by enemies I couldn't see save for that one eyebot, and the moment I shot it "You are wanted."
---
&gt;So people are being arrested for theft from a home that they were invited into because the home owner has been sitting on their hands about locking down all their belongings. Makes no sense. This could’ve been stopped a long time ago but somehow it’s the thiefs fault? Theft has been a part of society forever.
---
For the future: Get "Can Do" in luck tree and the Dog food one in endurance. *Can Do* will produce different types of long lasting food (including dog food) from lunch boxes, trash cans, etc.. (It is a search tool you have to initiate while looking at the container. It will tell you the hotkey to search). Grab any dog food you see in the world, when perked it gives 3x the benefit for hunger. 
---
Also if you do the main quests, the Overseer's cache's will have plans for water purifiers for your camp.
---
If not, you can grab the Hazmat suit on the roof of Poiseidon energy, in a trailer, and use that to collect dirty water with very low rads then boil that at a cooking station.
---
Do you have a link to that? I never saw it but would like to.
---
In my experience, it seems that there is a period of time before a disconnect where your progress, loot, location, etc. is not saved properly.
---
You might find that you are in a location where you were 5-10 minutes before the disconnect, that loot you had found is no longer there, that quests are a step or two behind, the stuff you built in your CAMP isn't built yet, etc. 
---
It's unfortunate but it explains it.
---
No, you're getting downvoted for being an idiot. After the first time he killed you the best idea you could come up with was to repeatedly return to the same area? If you needed to get into that location so badly why the fuck didn't you just hop to a new server instead of engaging him again?
---
Also why i mostly solo, you have to make sure everyone damages the mobs to get experiance. I don't like waiting. 
---
o god no. the luck is bad here but a bit of a moment for knowledge. what lvl are you? im 131 and i remember one time when i was a lower lvl and server hoping i saw it but since i was lower lvl i didnt have the caps. im thinking its lvl locked similar to the handmade rifle plan
---
Better hope the flapping ain’t a scorchbeast!! 
---
Well put me in that category. A category I'm still firmly ensconced in. 
---
This is pretty fucking simple. If a product isn't generating ROI it will be discontinued. In the case of fo76 the initial revenue would've been primarily used to pay down the debt caused by development of the product. Did they earn enough to cover the debt? Almost impossible to tell, but if their investment was in line with their expected sales my suspicion is no; fo76 is a loss. 
---
For ongoing development that's going to be funded by ongoing sales and micro-transactions. Again without that initial popularity it's very hard to see Bethesda committing to the size and scope of dev team that they would've had if the game was a runaway success.
---
Obviously, some of what they're doing now is face saving, so that they can mitigate further damage to their brand, but at some point if the money flowing out is greater than the money coming in they'll either drastically reduce the size of the team, or kill it altogether.
---
Either way, I'm pretty confident in saying that Bethesda will be investing significantly less into fo76 than they would've if it was a huge success.
---
Nice I have a lever action with nearly identical effects.  +30% to scorched, explosive, and I think though on mine the 3rd effect is +1 agi.  That thing is beastly vs scorchbeasts on my stealth sniper character...
---
even then, if you turn off tracking for all your other quests it starts showing the diamond on map and on screen of where the mob is. some times i find them stuck in rocks/walls/ground/ceiling and i have to vats kill them
---
Don't worry man it's really just a vocal minority. I've been playing with my friends since launch and the servers are always populated. 
---
"The glitch is there, so *obiviously* I'm supposed to abuse it!"
---
Yeah, that's how I felt when players were wetting themselves over the changes. 
---
" Just because you don't like something doesn’t mean that the people who  like it are wrong, it just means that you have different opinions. Fallout 76 is a good game, if you don’t know this already you’re lying to yourself. You can dislike a good game, there’s nothing wrong with that. "
---
See what I did there?
---
True.
---
That frill is the literal worst. How does adding that make me more sneaky?
---
It used to (still does on console) but the patch notes for the patch that was applied to P.C yesterday says under Perks: “All Night Long: All Night Long now decreases hunger and thirst growth at night” 
---
You said BF, which often means Boy Friend. But you meant Ballistic Fibers. 
---
After actually getting it and maxing it I regret not paying attention to Cover Operative in Fallout 4. 2.5x damage is beastly!
---
I've discovered and done everything in this game compared to Fallout 4, and I'm still playing it. 
---
I prefer the method they used to progress in the main quest for this game, where the quests are set in a linear path that allows you to discover everything around that location and then move on, similar to New Vegas, except their map was basically a linear path. Fallout 4 started out good, but then quickly sent you far down to Diamond City (level 20 enemy territory), which if you focus on exploring, you would forget about the main story due to the amount of time you'd be spending discovering Now, that's not saying 76's method was perfect, they could've added the level range of difficulty on the map for each zone since at one point, a quest sends you to the bottom while you have one at the top.
---
Just a simple, green, mutated, hulking man
---
It's good... But not human oven good. 3/5 ;)

---
I think the immersive-ness also has to do with the fact that you can’t just go back to your last save if you don’t like a choice you made or how something ended up - everything you do is final and you have to live with the consequences. I loved the the previous Fallouts but I often noped out of things and went back to my last save. This one feels more real.

Hemlock Holes

Graham and Phoenix are my two favorites.

That sounds good. My PSN is Ratiocinate. Throw me an invite when you're wanting to make the trade. I will be on for a little while shortly, and then on again later today.
---
I don’t believe you. 
---
That's weird - I've picked the lock before on the trailers at both Gorge and Wade and not gotten Wanted for it.  Maybe its containers related though...  both times I picked the lock to get the low level owners to the PA insider the trailers.  Never joined a team with them.
---
Liverssssss
---
And yet I enjoy them both... is there something wrong with me?
---
I have some tips. I have collected all sets possible from the wild
---
PC - Was hoping the patch would help things but these 2 issues are still loud and clear in the new patch.
---
I could buy one from someone, but I like to earn things myself. I'm a little stubborn that way haha.
---
The randomness is one of the best attributes of fallout 76. Being a multiplayer game it is very nice to have things come at random so not EVERYONE gets the same stuff. That's just boring. By keeping things random it makes you want to try your chances, it's like gambling, sometimes we win and every now and the. We hit the jackpot and pick up something very rare. 
---
Yes things are frustrating sometimes when you want something and can't find it, like for example, I'm an NCO in the Army and I would love to have me of the Camo and dress Army uniforms the scorched/goul military officers that carry nuke code pieces are wearing but I like to think that will come in DLC later. 
---
I would like Bethesda to know that as a military member it would be awesome to have one of those military uniforms. In fact something better, military exclusive uniform that cannot be traded or duplicated. Just show proof of military service current or inactive/veteran as well as branch of service to receive combat and dress uniforms of said branch! #bethesda #Fallout76
---
I think Bethesda did a great job for a first time multiplayer fallout and I believe it will only get better! Don't disappoint your die yards Bethesda! 
---
-SGT, A Co 1-179 INF. 
---
Grind moreeeeeeeee.  Or ask a friend.  U on PC? I got some two shots and explosives for trade (none on the same weapon though lol, just two shot OR explosive)
---
Aerodynamic: Power attacks drain less AP
---
Asbestos: +15 energy resistance, can't be set on fire
---
BioCommMesh: 50% increased chem duration
---
Braced: Reduced melee damage while blocking
---
Brawling: Improved unarmed damage
---
Custom Fitted: Sprinting takes less AP
---
Deep Pocketed: +10 carry capacity
---
Dense: Superior explosion resistance
---
Lead Lined: +10 radiation resistance
---
Lighter Build: Weight reduction, +2 AP
---
Muffled: Reduces detection from moving
---
Padded: Explosion resistance
---
Pneumatic: Reduced magnitude of staggers
---
Pocketed: +5 carry capacity (except raider torso)
---
Sleek: Increases movement speed while sneaking
---
Stabilized: Reduced scope sway
---
Strengthened: Reduces limb damage
---
Ultra-Light: Superior weight reduction, +5 AP
---
Weighted: 15% armor penetration on melee attacks
---
Don't have numbers on some of these. Most of them are scrap unlocks. I think BioCommMesh, Deep Pocketed, Dense, Strengthened and Ultra-Light are plan unlocks only.
---
yeah man this is amazingly annoying.  Getting ganbanged by 15 ghouls at the clubhouse and the misclicking on a sleeping bag on the ground is about as much fun as the whole "enemy banged your gun while reloading so now you can't control your character for 20 seconds" bug...
---
If you mean super as in Super Duper, than yes. Duping is no fun, ruins the Fallout experience for me.
---
They should also ban YouTubers who are sponsored or sharing links to sites where you buy in game items with real money. 
---
I am fine with the game. I play for about an hour a day and am level 25 currently. (Second toon - first toon made it to level 24)
---
I know most of the concerns revolve around the endgame but for me so far it’s been fun.
---
Protectrons in general are just too damn charming 
---
Another vote for this! I just explore, scavenge, occasionally do quests. If that's all you want to do, there's plenty of gameplay and the survival aspects don't horn in on it too much.
---
Nobody said this yet? XD
---
They even have press and hold for Invite to Team and Trading so the code is already in the game.
---
I think what they could have done is pushed back the official release and continued the closed beta.
---
Yes this, I'm gonna add this.
---
I've been farming whitespring/hordes for weeks and still havent gotten a 2 shot explosive. Seriously, i have 2 builds waiting for an exploding weapon. I have an assultron head but it's so buggy i'm afraid to use it in case it cleans out all my ammo again. 
---
Deathclaws drop black titanium as well
---
Sales are down by almost 50% from fallout 4 to fallout 76, just because servers are populated doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s a successful game, like on Titanfall 2 I have no problem finding full servers of people but the total population of the game is only like 1,000 people
---
M'kay, but the chances that the few people in your server are browsing this subreddit at this moment are slim to none.
---
More time = more invertion. Games still cost $60.
---
I'm currently in your shoes....grinding away for that x-01 jetpack....I have to be close to 600 attempts by now.
---
It's actually the closest Fallout has felt to the original isometric since Bethesda took over
---
Both what not to do and what to do to correct it lol
---
I just realized that 2nd effect, explosive, might not get bonus from Furious or it does? Weapon durability, other than LMG, not really a problem.
---
I'm getting close to giving up on armour and just running power armour 24/7. I don't have any good armour anyways haha.
---
Get over it bro or get good.
---
Whitesprings golf course, the pro shop
---
If you're low level, the "Leader of the Pack" event reliably gives you a bunch of legendaries. Otherwise people used to farm Whitesprings, but I'm not sure if that still works as well after the patch.
---
Could you send me a screenshot of it? I'm trying to get 200 more caps atm. 
---
Yep, I've heard of that one. Let me do an edit...
---
Found it. 
---

Not ban, mass delete.

Where do you farm abraxo?
---
POWER ARMOR IS FOR NERDS
---
I'm not sure about scaling, but I found (and since then grind) these after reaching lvl 60:
---
* inside **Emmett Mountain Disposal site**: lvl 91 Deathclaw
---
* around **Pleasant Valley cabins**: lvl 50-68 Supermutants and/or lvl 50-68 scorched (sometimes just lvl 40 Molemen though)
---
* around **Harper's Ferry**: lvl 50-68 Supermutants/Scorched, lvl 42 feral &amp; 62 bloated ghouls. Chance of 1-2 legendaries.
---
* **Watoga**: lvl 50 robots, chance of 2-3 legendaries. Easy killings for \~100XP each once you become their mayor.
---
* **Whitesprings** apartment circle (excluding the golf club): 15-20 lvl 42 feral &amp; 62 bloated.
---
* **Farm house south of Watoga train station**: 2 lvl 40+ Mirelurk kings, some lvl 40+ mirelurks, lvl 50 mirelurk queen; sometimes they are all scorched.
---
* **Robco Reseach Center**: lvl 52 Colonel Gutsys or lvl 50-68 Supermutants, outside and inside too.
---
* **Huntswille**: lvl 50-68 super mutants
---
* **Quarry X3**: lvl 50 Mirelurk queen.
---
I don't mind playing by myself, but the one thing I do dislike the the lack of human npcs, I hear all these story's on holo tapes or some story missions and every time you get to them it's a bloody robot. Makes the world feel emptier.

Grafton gym is the single best rubber farm location (80-90 rubber per 1 minute run) with each of the parks taking runner up status (Wavy Willards, Camden, Tyler County Fair) due to all the rubber balls and such around.

Yeah I agree. I mean I'm not excusing Bethesda for the state of the game on release. But at least they're trying to improve it and I appreciate that. 
---
The item sold, but I have a few more requests for them item so I will be trying to restock the inventory on it today. Check back when you are available.
---
Lol way to try and twist my words kiddo
---
Wait… Small Letter set is worth that much? I just drop the duplicates I’ve had. Fuck. 
---
I know it was sarcasm. I sold serums the other day to a kid and he messaged me saying I should stash my ammo because it's obvious I'm a duper. I had 9k 5.56 lol some people just don't understand how simple it is to craft some things
---
Agreed. Or at least let you do all three and get nine tokens, then it’d take 50 trips to Camden instead of 150. It’s absurd.
---
I have soloed my way to General in the enclave.  I think it is time I made some friends.  The game just got real hectic on me.
---
Hopefully the next patch adds actual content to the game. So far, after 2-3 months being released, there has been 0 new content. Old bugs that were in Fallout 4 are still in this game as of today. 
---
The Vengeful appeared literally 15 minutes after I killed one Stalking. He was pissed. 
---
 Now available to the English community !
---
Ok cool, thanks for the heads up bud. 
---
Well stated. Thank you
---
I know right, it's very easy to make ammo. Just takes some time and effort. 
---
Ahah thanks (although French here) :) !
---
Good, I hope everyone who dupes, knowingly trades with dupers, or explains to people how to dupe all get permanently banned. 
---
They've ruined the economy to the point nobody is sure it will ever come back, they tank server stability when the dupe occurs, and they've made PvP a joke by making every greifer and cheater have access to TSE weapons and buffs that let them get past the handshake by simple mass damage.
---
Let them all whine and go play something else 
---
The Rad - No Rad like SugarBombs is intentional. It is one stack of preserved (undamaged box) and exposed (damaged box).
---
The water is new.
---
Bro I drop those plans earlier 
---
I used to use armor all the time and once I finally got Excavator I sold my set and never looked back.
---
Making an example out of the shittiest of the shitty makes sense. It'll set the standard for what to expect if you cross Bethesda 
---
That would be neat, like the colored paints we get can be consumed to paint a single part that color
---
Shit man that's a good one 
---
You're incredibly rude and mean based on differences in opinion on how people should be punished in fucking video game.
---
Its 2019 pal. Dismissing anonymous internet opinions made sense maybe 10 years ago. Things are different now. Most of your life is going to be spent on the internet. You WILL be talked down to as long as you treat these comments like computer generated text to prod at. Realize theres a human fucking being on the other side of the screen. 
---
You cant treat strangers like that dude. I know it can be fun to get expressive on the internet, but you're hurting others, and honestly yourself, by making being an ass a part of your life.
---
awesome!!! Can't wait to dig in
---
Thanks for the share brother :-)
---
Thank you for this! Is he the only vendor that accepts techincal data? I’m so glad I’ve saved them.
---
I feel the same way about people who want passive lock picking / hacking perks.
---
A common sentiment is "I spent 20 minutes playing not realizing I still had my lock picking perks equipped!"
---
If you're not even noticing the lack of whatever perk you had otherwise, it's probably okay to just leave it equipped, isn't it?
---
Is ThIs A fUrRy???
---
That's why almost as always drop free things in a paper bag or in public containers for people. The trading system takes way too long.
---
Congratulations FrostyFreeze and +1 !  
---
i too would like to request your services. i dont know how many more time i can server hop, its maddening and taking away from actually playing. I have most of those mats now but will get some more of the Flux until i have enough. i will add you and keep an eye out.  Hope to see you this weekend. 
---
\-Zandar
---
i will sit on this info and watch
---
It works the same after the patch but you get slightly less exp
---
I might have 18 tokens now. Haha.
---
hell yeah it does!
---
Thanks Mister!
---
He is hilarious to listen to.  After I'm done transacting with him, I'll hang out just to listen to him ramble.
---
Tricen limbs and the X0-1 Experimental torso look pretty decent together
---
You're in trouble then. You could easily play for several hundred hours and never find a TSE. Probability of explosive + two-shot + good gun is around 1 in 2000 two-star legendaries.
---
I'd place it west of Camden Park.. like how it kind of is in real life...sortof.
---
It IS Logan!  You are absolutely right they should have just named it Logan.  I think they really wanted to include the exhibition coal mine.  As far as I know, Beckley didnt have as much striker activity as Logan did.
---
They're becoming what they hate
---
 I really don't think most people are going this route. I sure as hell will not buy or sell anything for the game. I may give Hand Made Rifles away, but I ain't gonna scam up some special gun. 
---
 Its just a game I play. ;)
---
Indeed !  If a modder was able to do this, I’m pretty sure the crafty dev team of this game can do it as well
---
Who is wooby?
---
I know, I've been enjoying the info.  The writeup on plans farming has netted YUGE gains.
---
You're over estimating how many people share your opinion because of your exposure to the social media aspect and how much this shit rolls across this subreddits front page.
---
Step out of the nerd rage bubble and it's kind of ridiculous what people are calling for man. You gotta admit.
---
I became addicted to addictol during the PC beta.
---
Hasn't happened since, so that irony has probably been fixed.
---
Here you go.
---
https://imgur.com/yIgz3te
---
Bear in mind when looking at the damage that I have the relevant perks equipped.
---
Yeah I really like the game too.  Its easy for me to just go in a building, clear it out and loot all the junk because I love fucking junk.  I just kinda wish there was more to do once you plateau as the Queen is boring and has shitty loot and whitesprings is just a bad nuke zone.  
---
&gt; "Everyone is already dead"  
---
Not true, we still have several other vaults that will be opening soon, as well as our fellow vault dwellers from 76. 
---
Do you really think Bethesda is going to Add NPC's to the game? If so I think you have more optimism than I do.
---
&gt; "dropping a nuke on a site spawns exponentially more scorched"  
---
That's kind of the point? The source of the plague are the scorch beasts. The scorch beast queen gives birth to the scorch beasts at an alarming rate. we drop a nuke on prime to draw her out, and we kill her. Thus, ending the plague 
---
But it doesn't end.... 
---
MODUS, Crypto, Prizebots, Nannybots, Mr Handys are all engaging.
---
bahahahaha excellent
---
I'm experiencing weirdness in some areas.
---
Loading seems faster, but now it's 2-step. It loads for a bit, then it puts me into the game screen, but with weird ambient lighting (too bright and uniform, eveything looks bleached), and I can't move. Though I am getting the sound effects (the public service tone if I log into an active event area, or have a quest update pending). Then it goes back to loading screen for another 5-10 seconds or so. And then it finally lets me into the game as normal.
---
FPS "feels" smoother, but it's hard for me to say because I'm usually running at the cap on PC anyway. 
---
But I am encountering WAY more crashes to desktop now. Before it was disconnects, and they do still happen. And I did have freezes, where the entire PC locks up and I have to pretty much restart it, because even Task Manager doesn't come up, and Windows key does nothing. But after patch I'm getting complete crashes to desktop, which I very rarely got before. And the crashes don't even throw any kind of error message or report, so I don't even know what's causing it.
---
Overall experience got worse. Game may load faster and run smoother, but the crashes are absolutely crippling, especially when trying to do long quests without checkpoints in between. I'm actually pretty close to putting this game on hold until they sort this shit out. Hasn't been a good patch for me at all. 
---
Agreed 100%. Played for 10+ hours on Wednesday and loved every second of it. The future most definitely looks bright
---
Doesn't it spawn in flatwoods with the junkie across the "river"
---
U dont follow the market i assume?
---
From my understanding, it does 2x damage and this stacks additional to sneak damage
---
Incoming YouTube videos saying Bethesda bad and wrong in in 3...2...
---
I have my base set up near whitesprings so that I can fire artillery at the golf club. I can clear the place out while barely firing any shots.
---
Niiiiice. Thank you!
---
Which platform and in game name?
---
I don't even know what Wooby is, since I don't watch YouTube videos about the game to avoid spoiling things...
---
...but it sounds like a thing that should happen, because I'm guessing it's some kind of cute robot and I love cute robots.
---
 Very nice. Saving up for those letter myself. A few more days and I should be able to buy them. 
---
Also:
---
If you die during an Event, you respawn in the event area. You don't have to pick a "known location" respawn like you do when you die at other times. 
---
Yeah agreed, the plans farming post and the food recipes writeup this week have been amazing boosts to my own knowledge base.
---
PVE only option would 100% fix the player problem.  For the longest time, I said "the only people complaining about problems in '76 are the cheaters.  If we just play as intended, it's perfectly stable and enjoyable (for the most part)."  But now the cheaters are coming to us.  Now we have to go to the Scorchbeast Queen and deal with all the instability that ensues.  I would also be fine if blocking a player would block all damage from them, including the damage blocking fast freaking travel away from the harasser.  Maybe make them stay blocked for a week or something so people don't try to exploit it by turning it off and on somehow.  Or if enough people block a person, maybe they need to be shown the exit?
---
I use mine a lot, being at whitesprings all the time sort of damands it.
---
i always claim the place that can produce unradiated food that left of the vault it's nice because players seem to rarely attack it and the enemies are low level when they come
---
Sweet. I sent you a friends request. 
---
Dude, that's the whole reason i switched. Never been a fan of gatling weapons, minigun etc, cause i hate waiting for that spin, I'm a burst fire for accuracy player til i die. Now with the gatling guns and the great damage per shot i took bear arms just because i found one. I started this morning with 4 flavors of gatling. Then a buddy traded a tse (2 star) gatling and another gave away an explosive .50 
---
My inventory is currently filled with bunker buster, tse gatling, vats 2 shot gatling, explosive .50, daisycutter, pyrolyzer, a mutants lmg, bloodied gatling plasma. With way to many chems and aid I'm sitting at 240/330
---
Wooby is the sole human NPC in the entire game - located within the Dev Room. Lore-wise, he doesn’t actually exist, and nobody is intended to access the Dev Room other than the developers of the game. 
---
Shotguns? Scrap for rubber/steel
---
I always have to sell it and never pick up gym equipment.
---
Why is this being framed as a bad thing ..?
---
Daaaamn, those are some good stats. I'd take or leave the scorched condition, but the other two? Those are GOOD!
---
And if it takes BF to make, it should scrap back out...
---
Definitely post the video, I would like to see how it looked from your view. I was in a team with the person you think is hacking, I was level 119 and wearing excavator power armor. Their health bar was full the whole time for me and our other teammate until the owner of the base you shot came and killed us.
---
Can you put auto receivers on hunting rifles?
---
I mean I wouldnt consider it a dick move. I've leveled people's bases with rocket turrets before. There's no need, leave it 100 yards back just kite them. If you are the only one there then good on you, you get the easy kill but the people grinding shouldn't suffer. 
---
Look in a stash box before you try to repair or craft anything.
---
Seen the distorted mongrels a few times. I couldn't figure where to shoot at one of them.
---
&gt; does feel completely unfair and I find myself sparing the non-legendary bots to just go about their duty. It's like slaughtering cattle. 
---
A mangled, subservient assaultron winces and sparks as it tries to reorient it's optics to see what monster has recently attacked it...
---
As the final blow is about to be landed, it looks upon the face of the one he has been programmed to serve and lets out a final query.
---
&gt;Why? 
---
Dude I met this level 6 dude who one hit me with a machete. I'm level 55 and had PA on. Unreal how much people will fuck with a good game.
---
I have two characters at level 90 - one with luck 5 and one with luck 15 with no buffs. The one with 15 luck yields much much better legendaries.
---
If the game needs a damage reset, then do it.
---
Once they fix duping there's a small percentage of players who will drop off because they enjoyed duping.
---
Same thing applies to tse guns. Some ppl will drop off when they can't kill everything in one shot
---
This thread must stay alive!
---
Dang I would've payed out the wazoo for that pitchfork. It's right up there with the super sledge and regular sledge in my book
---
It should be fine if they just nerfed those weapons, so that every build is balanced.
---
And of course, don't allow bobbleheads to be stacked.
---
Did the incorrect weight get adjusted to the RadAway and other chems with Traveling Pharmacy?
---
Didn't read the post, did you?
---
This is basically what happens every time.
---
I don’t like duper’s but I loath little snitches. How about don’t be a rat and let bathesda do their job.
---
More like Fallout 75.5 if you ask me
---
I'm not going to get into another 50 comments of angst. The guy called me a lier. Defending myself is wrong? The guy should have approached it better. We both talked earlier today and dms and agreed we were both being asses. 
---
I WANT THAT!
---
Totally agree here. Additional radio stations/music would be nice because I like it in the background.
---
It's their  S O O T H I N G . V O I C E .
---
Those long dogs are the worst
---
\[These guys\]([https://imgur.com/a/MPwgexO](https://imgur.com/a/MPwgexO)) crack me up.  Were you born or made?
---
Didn’t know you could do that. I’m on Xbox so my gallery is restricted to in-game photos. 
---
Yes. On Xbox you open your quick wheel and press RB on the slot you want to change.
---
If that's what you think, then my only regret is that it wasn't stupid enough to make people like you want to explore the inside of a wood chipper.
---
If it decreased it at all times, i'd consider allocating more END points to use it. Guess i'll just play in short bursts until they tweak the hunger/thirst gains again
---
God this dev team is so amateurish. Not only are their coders bad, but their CQ is nonexistent. How do they not catch this? It's one of the most basic test cases there is. 
---
I don't believe so. H will work for health kits on PC
---
Gotcha. Thanks. 
---
Great idea!!
---
Bark twice if you're in Milwaukee 
---
Your best bet is to buy the tokens and put friends to work. 
---
I've had my outfit since near launch and so far I've only seen one other person rocking it lol 
---
Farm mole miners and the breach and clear event.
---
Man, it really sounds like you've got it figured out!  This might be more my speed.  When I cool down, this is where I'll start probably.  I deleted all my stuff to the soothing sounds of Country Roads this morning.
---
Underarmor?
---
How long does it take to break?
---
 I follow the real market closely. I know who has caps, who is out and where the things I want might appear.
---
 The internet "buy my awesome crap" I completely ignore, as I'm sure most people do. 
---
How does garbage like this get so many upvotes?
---
Honestly? It took me reaching level 76 before I found my first explosive weapon. It’s a quad-capacity Double Barrel Shotgun. 
---
I’d be a little upset, though primarily because I wouldn’t be able to run around in Marine armor pretending to be *Doom Guy.*
---
Sorry, I wasn't clear. I called OP a dick because he was actively destroying the other player's camp while the other player was trying to build instead of just communicating. And also for bragging about it on Reddit.
---
I would be absolutely fine with OP torching the turrets after the camper left or when the ghouls started spawning. Shrug.
---
What's your gamertag? 
---
It hates everyone.
---
People have them more commonly than that due to duping.  Since TSE is so OP ( or any E shotgun), those were the ones duped and sold.
---
The rest of us are grinding, hoping, and waiting to hear what Beth will do about the current imbalance.
---
Really? I honestly didn't think luck would factor in very much. I may have to test it! Thanks for the tip!
---
Whatchu got against Nathan Fillion?! (I'm not positive that it is really him, but if it isn't truly Nathan, then I think I need my hearing checked.)
---
Heh I have a big video update coming with everything I have learned from doing a chainsaw build into the high 80s including videos of it wrecking all the high level baddies including SBQ.  It's a lot of fun but with the recent patch and not being sure what damage type the scorch beasts ranged attacks are I have two more perks to test and then next week should be a big update.  After that I will start tackling rippers, mr handies, and drills.
---
For me From top middle, it's weapons around the right, and aid items around the left. Possibly putting more often uses things in specific spots.
---
Any laundry room or Janitor closet. Best so far is at Whitesprings, outside the resort in Maintenance building. There is a laundry room with about 5ish. Then after that I just try to remember where, but I start at Whitesprings. 
---
Nuke zones are a pain.
---
PA and hazmat suits have a hidden modifier in them.
---
You can stack rad resistance higher than PA and you'll only get to 10 rad per sec while PA sits at 2.
---
The post pointed out ONE way they're broken. I pointed out another as evidence to support the conclusion that they are indeed broken. Didn't think about my reply, did you? Trying to be that guy, aren't you? Don't be that guy.  
---
Keep fighting mole miners and scrap the junk they drop. When that gets old, kill deathclaws. When that gets old, use the titanium generator at workshops. Yeah it sucks
---
Yes, come to our place...
---
I only use mine for ze queen and scorchbeasts...so as long as they change those, I don't mind em gone.
---
Having fun trying out the weird legendaries I have right now.  Found a neat laser pistol I'm trying with.
---
Yep.  I don't know how they didnt launch it that way.  They directly addressed "griefing" in advance of launch, but they shit the bed on the pacifist system.
---
It's good that it breaks easier, it was impossible to get it below 100 for a fresh over repair before.
---
I'd rather them nerf the guns and maybe add a new legendary effect better than TSE after duping is patched. I grinded for days trying to get a tse and when I did it was only lvl 30. So having it completely removed would make me upset and probably put down the game.
---
 Like I stated, if they were to nerf the gun, I'd be upset but I'd understand why, thus making me go out and trying to grind for the new best thing if they added one.
---
I was actually waiting for an online fallout for last ten years so cannot really agree. Also its not wasteland if the raiders arent players.
---
Trash cans for trash would be cool too.
---
Most people are more mad people who make constant posts like this thread and allow this treatment of to continue and probably the same people who still pre order, and usually children.
---
So where's the source? I can't find it anywhere
---
What comment would that be?
---
Because it hit r/all and I had a morbid curiosity about the type of person who would defend fo76.
---
I'm just saying that if Zenimax didn't shut down ESO because of its shitty bungled launch then they'll give FO76 time to get sorted out, it wouldn't be shut down after three months haha.
---
Bethesda/Zenimax develop long-lasting games, that people play well over the estimated time of completion, they realize that if they can keep a small part of the players returning then they'll consider it to be a successful game and keep adding content because those players will keep spending money in the atom store.
---
Players see time frames differently than companies, they think changes have to be immediate or the whole thing should just be tossed. I don't understand why. Companies see games like this as ongoing projects that will be worked on for years.
---
If they did that there will be a PR disaster of Bethesda is so slow to fix bugs that they start banning the remaining 6 players of FO76! which is just a very very bad idea PR wise
---
I've sold every bobblehead I've picked up. I also have a large magazine collection because 1) they can't be sold, 2) I forget to use them, and 3) some don't explain their buffs.
---
I'm pretty sure someone says something like this every day on this culty sub.
---
Its fun, stop being so philisophical about it.
---
"What do you have to gain?" Lmao it's called your junk and a good time. That's what we have to gain. I'll be waiting for my downvotes...
---
All it would take is another TSE user to one shot them, stealth boy, and keep farming them.  
---
I imagine that's what they wanted though, to start some pvp by getting a big wanted price.
---
I'm so proud of this, you did an amazing job here! It turned out beautifully. 
---
Im on PC level 46-47?  username BEEBSTEEN if you want to add me 
---
I would hope that most people finding a tse, would have enough love for the game to understand it would only be done to save the game you love so much.
---
Nah, rather not join the brotherhood of the traveling pants. Nice video though.
---
It's not. In any way. T51b is ferrari, t60 is ford. 
---
I agree 100%. They have patched most of the bugs away that annoyed me, so this is the single biggest annoying thing in the game now. There have been many times I have wanted to play, only to remember that my character is currently almost at the limit and I would have to spend a bunch of time selling stuff and/or moving it to my mule and decide "Naw, too much trouble. I'll do something else right now". That's not good.
---
Did you guys not read Fireproof post patch?
---
Most of the mods are so 'light touch' they have not broken with patches. I didn't update any of the 3 I use last night and didn't notice any problems.
---
That guy is fucking brilliant :D cooking everyone in his oversized oven :D 
---
ive found t51 jet packs and shocks. still need optimized bracer plans.
---
It's fun to harrass people that just got the game and risk them never playing again? Why are you such an asshole, honestly? Would you appreciate it if you just started a game and we're being harrassed by high levels?
---
sorry, pc. should have added that to the post, my bad
---
&gt;I dont drink 7 bottles of water in a day in real life.
---
FWIW: Youre supposed to drink 8 ounces of water 8 times a day.. so thats sort of on par with what your saying..
---
That's it, you're going on a list. We are coming for you. /s
---
All jokes aside, community policing is the most successful form of policing. Duping would be stopped if more people reported the Dupers. Think about it, who purchases the duped items? Who creates the market? The buyers or sellers? Or both? 
---
Always lay out one floor's taller items down before laying down floors for the next floor.  It was a nightmare when I finally decided to rebuild my camp - must have done it more than a dozen times, and then if you mess something up I couldn't even scrap/remove portions, had to drop the camp down again/move it.  
---
Fusion generator, PA station, other tall objects absolutely must be placed before starting on the next floor.  I'd drop the through the wall connector down as well first before flooring up the next floor.
---
Actually, I have the time to share a couple stories.
---
During the beta, I acquired a chameleon effect shoulder pad in trade from a man who had accidentally shot me in the face as he was coming out of the agricultural center. This was the moment I decided I would become the Mysterious Stranger. 
---
After a few hours of wandering I found a guy fresh out of the vault who had stumbled across a nest of feral ghouls and was shouting into his microphone as he frantically tried to kite them. I hunkered down in a bush and proceeded to rapidly take out the ghouls with my pipe revolver from invisibility. Once the guy realized he was safe he cried out, asking who was there to come to their rescue. I remained silent until he wandered off a few minutes later and went to investigate the bag he dropped, finding a purified water and Salisbury steak.
---
For a brief moment as I contemplated this offering, I realized that I had become a literal god to another human being.
---
Fast forward a couple weeks. I'm level 37 exploring the area around Grafton lake when I notice my armor condition is degraded. I head up to the steel works workshop figuring that even if there is no available armor bench I can claim the territory and build one myself. So I wound up spending half an hour hunting super mutants to clear the area. As I come out of the complex with no bench found and head to the workshop, I spot someone with 11 levels on me and a matching set of T-60 armor halfway through the claim.
---
I kvetch a bit but decide against picking a fight, so I ask them to consider placing a bench for me. They instead prioritize setting up fences and extractors (locked, of course) so I turn to leave. That's when the workshop defense event pops up anglers.
---
Not one to pass up free adhesive, I turn back to help a bit with the fight. So of course a fresh army of mutants begins pushing their way through the foundry while we are engaged with the anglers. Forty five minutes this man and I fought back to back. Endless waves of green and sickly pale skin rolling in, a vertibot providing close air support until it was killed and rained down shrapnel and fire. Forty five minutes in which this thief was my brother.
---
As I walked back toward my camp, 84 adhesive and a heart emote richer, I found contentment
---
on pc, forgot to add that to the post. names Rossington
---
I clicked Local Weather. High of **100,000,000° Celsius**, partly mushroom cloudy.
---
well if there is then they can find it
---
no, im a dick
---
Thank you for not saying "Aunt Flo".
---
They slowed it down, didn't they? It sounds ridiculous lol 🤣
---
Did not fix the one shot mob problem. Griefers are still fairly rare, but 30 second queen kills are way too common. Mob play is ruined. Too many epic guns
---
It would have been neat if it were, now that Cayde is gone. 😢😭
---
 Its pretty good solo. Its not Stalker and that's my only criticism really. ;)
---
Yeah lost a calibrated x 01 leg that way. Wasn't fun, still kinda pissed.
---
Normal humans require food and drink every 35.7 seconds or we will 𝘿𝙞𝙚. 
---
I noticed it last night after fast traveling a bunch and server hopping a few times.
---
oh that would be cool if it showed up on the map
---
&gt;To all 5 or 6 of you
---
Jesus Christ.
---
I couldn't care less if all TSE weapons were removed (not that I think they should be) but sweet bloody Mary are ya'll *SUPER melodramatic* about this.
---
My friend was delivered a TSE Gatling gun on her doorstep yesterday morning.
---
I have a level 10 TSE 10mm.
---
I haven't even played that long.
---
Still waiting on the Gatling laser and plasma to be fixed. I hate reloading everytime I switch weapons.
---
I was using TSE against them but we all know how broken PvP is and how difficult it is to take on two people with TSE when there's one of you.
---
Ah you were the one that prompted me to do some further testing with SK receivers. How much damage does the game say your SK SMG deals? How much damage does the game say your standard receiver SMG deals?
---
As I mentioned in another comment I think the description is just silly and its shown damage already takes in the -20% from the standard receiver suggesting its Scorched damage is higher than even a hardened receiver.
---
That said, I was not able to kill a Scorchbeast within seconds as you have so I'm very curious how much damage your SMG does.
---
I would like left/right scrolling through weapons, quick up for healing,, and your idea of long hold to open the wheel.
---
man, i love my excavator, it makes me a walking pack mule! one day i'll find those calibrated shocks mod for it and i will be the happiest hoarder ever!!!
---
Well, there are a number of bad/rushed design decisions. It's okay to call them out as such. 
---
Hopefully they make legendary items feel better soon. 
---
Much cheaper way would be to set up a good distance to the south, say, near the bear den. Build a few artillery pieces.
---
Might be cheaper. 
---
Me too. This game scratches my itch for mmo and single player. I've been playing since day one and continue. I just we had some higher level mobs to fight. I'm usually running into mobs that are level 60 something and I'm level 96. I every once in a while will run into a level 90 something deathclaw but usually kill that in about 3 hits with my level 50 All Rise.  ;)
---
I hope they add free dlc which includes human npc and new factions and new missions 
---
You actually aren’t.  You get most of your water from food.
---
You can block people from the social tab. I believe it makes you invisible to them on the map. 
---
I'd actually be happier with them adding a craftable diaper that has to be worn over other armor. First mod slot lets you choose which weapon to negate damage from (weapon you don't like). The second slot makes all enemies in the area passive to you. The only way to remove it should be completing the quest..Find the big boy pants
---
&gt; Beth really should just implement PVE servers.
---
If only. :( I don't think Bethesda realized that many of us who *wanted* multiplayer Fallout were looking for a co-op campaign, not a Fallout gankbox. I could go play Rust if I just wanted to build a base only to be killed and have it destroyed.
---
Did either of you actually earn it, or just gifts from the piles of dupes
---
Maybe when you go get some, get more for later?  So you don’t have to reroute?
---
MonkaS
---
great!!  Love it!
---
The ending with the PA clad patroller in Camp Venture... and the flag... oh my
---
talented video maker :)  loved it!!
---
how? hacks?
---
No there’s not. They’re both exploiting for their own selfish reasons. 
---
Just two,  [level 35 Legs require a total of 80 springs](http://dulfy.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fallout-76-excavator-power-armor-guide-13.jpg)
---
Even more for the level 45 ones, best collect those clipboards. 
---
Oh.. we all noticed.  Before this patch, I (speaking for myself only) thought that was actually intended.
---
I'm online and still have this set if you want it. IFN: RebelsAdvocate
---
&gt; Congrats, you can list phrases out of context
---
So, there's context that excuses your use of childish insults yet there's no context that excuses the other posters'? Look, I have no wish to debate you on this whole thing. I actually thought you had some valid points. I just found it pretty galling that you called out another poster on using childish insults when you yourself resorted to them several times. Excuse it all you want, though. Makes no difference to me. I was just sayin....
---
&gt; I stand by everything I said.
---
And that's what makes you a hypocrite, which is exactly what I was trying to point out. 
---
Could be trying to platinum the game by doing the pvp trophies?
---
Lol I hear ya man but there’s ways that bathesda can track people’s activity without players blowing up the devs inboxes with the names of every body and their mother who they believe are cheating. 
---
So you enjoy mass groups of overpowered players? I have little pvp issue, but it runs mob play.
---
It worked for me. My alt is a polar opposite to my main. 
---
Fully theory crafted, no melee or PA. 
---
Basically a vats riflemen. I do use PA but my perks don't revolve around it, same with melee. Im finally closing in on 50 so i got my mutations going.
---
The xp nerf alone makes it a nice smooth ride, not blast through levels 20-50 faster than 1-20 lol.
---
Running to harpers ferry at 15 was nerve wracking. Its quite different leveling now than at launch.
---
What's it worth to you :)
---
They took what was in fallout 4, and cut it down to 10%. Then people farmed them. So they nerfed the item spawning for locations.
---
https://imgur.com/a/zFn9bfH
---
It does, I have all the rifle perks and I think the damage is around 220
---
Same here - as well as sudden, intense low FPS "lag" (PC is a beast... no reason for such poor performance other than server communication.)
---
15 second refresh times for opening containers for loot, as well.
---
As a level 300 player with every single TSE in the game it’s really hard to engage in PVP with someone. They barely ever engage and if they do your the one that’s wanted another headache, Do you think building a base in white springs will net me more PVP opportunities? Especially if they attack first?
---
What is your channel?
---
Is what a good thing?
---
Great work Knight Samasoku!
---
Rad Sponge + Ghoulish is pretty OP in Nuke Zones
---
Next week they release that update on consoles.. It fixes lot of issues and add new mechanics 
---
I don't have anything to trade but I believe the primary features (named) can't stack together.  So no Two-Shot Furious.  Instead you might find a two-shot with faster fire rate, and less weight, or two-shot with faster reload and fire rate, etc.  The 3 you mention are prefix legendary mods and so is Two-Shot.
---
PR wise, you might be right.  We could be stuck here until an expansion makes all of this stuff obsolete.  Incoming super damage mitigation/full explosion resistance or something.  
---
I don't think it's only 5% that don't mess with dupers.  Me and all of my friends can't imagine ruining our own fun by duping, it's much more exciting letting someone else ruin our fun by duping!  (/s on the last bit)
---
Totally! xD  
---
Nawh. I do see why people might enjoy PA and think it cool. I just much prefer a faster and more agile play style, where the PA makes me feel very clunky moving around and fighting. I wish there was some better and more equal options to PA.
---
I have over 180 hours in and never found an explosive weapon, let alone a tse. 
---
The feeling of futility is what killed it for me. I spend a long time doing rounds to sell my scrap and other stuff off, micro manage the crap out of my inventory to find out people can easily just dupe all the best weapons, caps and bobble heads. Like even If I eventually get to farming legendaries I'll just get nuked from orbit by dupers most of the time with far superior gear. 
---
Even is I abstain from PvP it's sometimes inevitable with workshops and It still feels crap that these people show up at a fight and instantly kill everything. And we haven't even gotten to people that are lvl 9999 because of the xp exploits early game.
---
The only way I can see this working out is actually fixing really bad exploits like xp/duping and doing a clean start, also making sure duped items can be identified if it arises again. But I'm pretty sure they won't ever achieve that so I kinda gave up.
---
I hope I never get this guy as a juror.
---
I just picked up a TSE lvl 30 Lever Action Revolver from a bot. Was so excited to level up!!
---
Sadly, the DMV will remain.
---
Lucky you! I had an explosive bullet weapon too and it was damn powerful. Unfortunately, I pressed the letter 'R' by mistake and the gun fell through the world never to be seen again, but it's all good as I've still got my trust Super Sledge and Gatling Gun :)
---
Watch out for all that edge guys.
---
I got a tse lvl 40 combat shotty from mole miners ages ago and i love it. Id be real sad if it got deleted, would much prefer a nerf
---
Did you earn them, or just from the piles of dupes?
---
I just read a post where someone said Wooby is in the dev room. If that's the case, it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be in game, as previous Fallouts have had stuff in dev rooms that was never used. 
---
I'm trying not to get too spoiled on things though, so I'm not going to look into it.
---
Pretty sure it didn't for me yesterday after the patch
---
A two shot crossbow. I don't know how this is things looking up. I'd be pretty disappointed.
---
Ahh, had wondered how it works. Thanks for the clarification 😁
---
Most of the time. *Not* always.  
---
I run a gatling gun, and if I start firing on someone at point blank range, my gun will routinely miss to the far left. I have to stop firing and aim at a further target to re-center the shots. The game has some sort of funky weapon convergence thing going on that breaks at point blank.
---
Y'all don't know what low level harassment is!!
---
Unless you played WoW during vanilla or even the first two expansions and tried leveling in Stranglethorn Vale on a PvP server!!!
---
Go YouTube "don't make me get my main" it's literally that.
---
How long have you been playing? I came in with a ton of hope but I finally started feeling the grind around level 40. Just wait.
---
$20 is $20 not free idiot.
---
Bloodied is a bigger problem in that case then. Bloodied melee builds having 20k+ damage lol 
---
True but at the same time this would be a lot of fun to roll play. Make a DEA clan and roam the wastelands as corrupt cops. I'm definitely curious to see how all this stuff affects the player vendor shops that are coming... 
---
If you only vendor for a few days, it'll get sorted.
---
BF are easy to get by scrounging the military posts, I visit the one just west of the Lake Side Cabins regularly and pick up ammo pouches, usually end up with about 10-15 BF after scrapping.
---
There is one other location I know of farther east but I have not visited it yet so cannot speak about yield there.
---
I did say strawman, hehe. Logical fallacies. Love them. 
---
I’m a Neanderthal, I apppalagoize
---
Nah they rather post it for likes and subs and claim it’s informative for Bethseda.
---
I almost always find one in the basement where you pick up the vox syringer in Monongah
---
Call of duty at least provided people to play with/against
---
The handholding of pacifist players who want to be by themselves makes it hard to do anything that's not pve
---
It's far too wide-reaching of a solution, and not even much of a solution at that. Removing TSEs is just sweeping the problem under the rug. Even without duping, this will become an issue again unless they tackle the actual problem, which is a horrendous lack of balance
---
what we need is player.modav carryweight
---
At least you can tag them as melee at least hits one at a time. I appreciate a smart pvp build, but I like to play not watch the TSE guys play.
---
Yup. I used to move my camp almost every session to keep it close to where I was questing, but one day I discovered a junk heap just behind my shack in the bushes. I built an extractor and haven't moved my camp since.
---
Super curious how you got 3 primaries on one weapon
---
Since the last PC patch, the loading screen quickly shows another picture (stock or from gallery) just before loading into the game. In addition, sometimes a washed out, partially loaded environment in black and white or yellow-purple shows for a second before the picture goes black and the correct view appears. For example, loading into Whitesprings shows some chimneys, parts of the roof, some Windows in monocrome, the rest is missing/transparent.
---
where are you finding that stuff? There are no crafting recipes for cola yet that I know of. Even in the factory, I don't see the Grape anywhere.
---
Throwing back rudeness and vitriol isnt defending yourself really, it's just making the whole thing worse. Yall both admitted it got too heated in DMs. 
---
Maybe that's a signal that theres something to learn from here yeah?
---
I'm not trying to be overly mean. I was just upset seeing account called Advice4Advice get toxic like that over video game stuff. You clearly started the account with GREAT intentions. You wanted to make reddit a place where you connected with people and talked about what matters. I think that part of your personality is a whole lot cooler than the one dealing with fallout drama.
---
I'm not perfect, I'm a smarmy jackass too. Trying to do better feels good though. It can honestly be tough in regular day to day life with how dynamic it can be. We have control over how we communicate here though. Might as well try our best ya?
---
So your character finding out what happened and nuking the fissure isn’t story? Your character specifically exploring what’s left of the world is 100% story. Unless you’re saying it would magically be different with human shapes terminals explaining what was going on?
---
Honestly this shit is so pedantic. I hate to break it to you but Destiny doesn’t decide the definition of story or lore lmao. I like the story or lore or whatever the hell you want to define it as. If you can’t deal with that statement then we’re just gonna have to disagree. 
---
The best you can get for dmg is a low HP build with unyielding armor x5 and a bloodied axe - but what you have now is already good, if you don't want low HP build you could try to find another axe with Anti-armor or furious as prefixe
---
This right here!
---
Stealth boys are good cause they can't vats you.  Snipe em from range! Bwahahaha!
---
Damn feral dachshunds
---
no your a cunt so you can get fucked
---
They have a dev room in most games they make. Its just them doing what they always do without thinking about the context of multiplayer lol.
---
I have that problem too i think.  I'll be in third person, reticle on say a particular spot on a wall a bit in front of me, and the shots will land like.. 4 feet to the right.  I go in to first person and it centers on my aim which fixes it.  It might be related but I think when enemies are close, it's not just that causing the issue.  I think it's sometimes in combination with but mostly related to where the shot originates from your character.
---
Explosive weapons are all currently the worst weapons in the game. Throw away asap.
---
Don't think it's that good anyway.  Think I sold mine to a trader
---
dude, i love it too.
---
Finding someone and showing them back to my CAMP when they are lower level than me is soooo much fun.
---
the diamond DOES NOT show where the mob is..it will always be in the center of the circle that you have to search..and as most have stated..most the time the mob of ghouls carrying signs just simply never spawn
---
Oh so they do exist! Thanks for letting me know, my luck had to leave something out 1000 tries later regardless ahaha.
---
Look at this acid tycoon over here. 
---
I give Bandersnatch a 0/5 it just seems rushed.
---
"I should try again"
---
My point was that not all insults are childish or undeserved. If you didn't want to debate it then why the fuck did you waste your time writing not one, but two comments? You're calling ME a hypocrite? "No offense, but let me just say something that I know will offend you, no offense"
---
race for first kill!
---
Yeah, I'm assuming. I heard him on game chat laughing at me, asking me how I felt. Fucking trolls.
---
Ugh
---
Stop gaming the system and just play the game.
---
What’s the point of just grinding? You only do it so you can grind more.
---
Eventually it seems to get old and people start complaint about not having anything to do.
---
Hi my name is Alexander and i was an addict for 3 months. I realized they made me violent and i would just find whatever weapon, machete, rolling pin, even a tambourine. I would just punch and slash everyone.... I had to stop.... I took an addictol and i felt better. I had a relapse once but for about 4 or so days now ive been sober now. 
---
No thanks.  I need to carry 1000s of lbs.
---
They probably see the metadata, rush over to read the whole thing, sigh loudly, and then go onto the next thing.
---
To vendors?
---
Your quote and your reply are 100% truth.  I would PVE to the end of time with you lads.
---
There are 2, actually..
---
Ark for me, dinosaurs are so cool.
---
I just dont use it. Im sledge hammer unyielding melee
---
No its decent and I will take it over a assassins wooden left leg anyday, got to look at the bright side, many drops could have been much worse
---
Hunting rifles made up the first 30 some odd levels of the game for me, then I got a handmade and a lever action, both quad legendary so I figured it was time to dump the old bolt for something a bit faster. Maybe if I get a good legendary on a hunting rifle I’ll switch back
---
Rock on brother
---
Xbox one :-)
---
Sounds good to me! I'll be on later today but I'll be more free tomorrow.
---
Yeah i was in the same boat the only way to counter tse bullies is with a tse yourself. I managed to get a good amount of caps selling bulk materials on reddit then purchasing my own tse, whether or not it's duped I dont know... most likely but what can you do. Until explosives are nerfed in pvp or something is done to fix it this is your best bet. I've comfortably sat on 20k caps from selling bulk materials at 25 to 30 caps a bulk. I also build my camp near white springs to fast travel between the map at cheaper price, goto the vault and your camp then fast travel from there for way cheaper travelling I use this method to help me clear out vendors every day you can easily get 1k from vendors alone (there might be perks to increase vendor caps) good luck! 
---
Thanks dude, when if v-sync is disable g-sync can be enabled!
---
I've had the same problem, If you start firing first then zoom in you keep the reticle for awhile. Hopefully its a bug and they will fix it.
---
I have 9 charisma and rank 3 of the bargain perk. My purified water sells for 5 caps each.
---
snicker, member of the Ashenvale rapid response team, checking in.
---
Look at a can of purified water in your inventory, the price will be shown there.
---
ok ican help for french !
---
Being able to play the Devil’s advocate is good. It means you understand other people’s point of view well enough to concisely argue it for them.  
---
It shows you’ve got an open mind.
---
Seconded. I'd rather wear nothing but a marine wetsuit vs the sniper costume.
---
I enjoy the game, too, but I'm not going to say "I can't thank them enough" simply for doing their jobs and fixing problems the game has.
---
There's plenty to do in pve. Its the majority of the game.
---
But you missed my point, its rediculous to suggest call of duty is a mmo.
---
“This is the fucking *fifteenth* Reddit post today. Can’t we just change the algorithm to exclude Reddit posts?” 
---
“No. Reddit ISIS.” 
---
Popcorn, get your popcorn, only 19 caps a bag.  
---
There should be some sort of finality when you spend your special points.  I agree with it progressively getting more expensive each time you do it until it reaches the cap limit with so.e kind of timer.  Maybe even allow for dual load outs or builds one for say crafting and base building and one for combat.
---
I have hard bargain 3, its 4caps a bottle. Never tried while taking barter pill 🤔
---
Thanks for the gun man!
---
Except that they dont need to be removed to save the game. Its not dying the way people are saying and if it were it would be because half the mechanics are useless because you cant stay in a server long enough to take advantage of them (example: the higher end workshops.) and there are innumerable bugs other than that as well.
---
that explains why I saw people with so many strange masks 
---
What do you mean "can't decide"? 
---
She is a ghoul and she is beautiful. Don't let others define you, girl. ❤
---
I’m still hoping for a display stand  for bobble heads 
---
That is a fine point lol. Bolstering leather and mutants robot arms are my bane.
---
It doesn't bother me. It's very Fallout
---
Its not the info that I wanted, but thanks... I guess 
---
some people say yes but for me it doesn't seem to do anything on explosive bullets. i tried with the perk on and off on watoga robots shooting the ground and seems to be the same. So i dunno the jury is out.
---
Full/overfilled stashes still cause instabilities.
---
Only fix , atm, is changing player behaviour.
---
I'm pushing 2 weeks of crash free game play with less than a half dozen dcs.
---
I personally don't have a problem with the way inventory works in this game. Those who complain about it are mostly new to the game, because:
---
1. They're used to hoarding in previous titles/games and lack inventory management skills.
---
2. Don't know what items/components to keep because you need to play more to find out.
---
The basic rule of what to keep and what not to keep is simple. You keep more of what's rare and uncommon to find, and keep less what is common to find. However, you need to also consider what you use more of in addition to it's rarity.
---
For example: 
---
* Things like Bones are useless to hold and should only be acquired when needed.
---
* I don't commonly use concrete, ceramic, copper, silver, or gold, so I just keep a quantity of 30-75.
---
* For components like black titanium, screws, springs, and adhesive I hold between 150-200 of these.
---
* Things that you will use up instantly like acid, cloth, steel, lead, and ultracite, you will keep stashing until it starts to fill up your stash box in which you can use to craft gunpowder/ammo.
---
Any excessive components you acquire throughout the day can be bulked and sold to vendors. Crafting armor to discover mods is not worth the time and resources, you're better off participating in events, purchasing the plans by vendors, or finding the plans in the world. You never really have to craft guns, unless they're rare like radium, handmade, etc., to acquire mods. Depending on what you have to craft, you don't need much at endgame other than mostly endgame components. If they were to consider increasing the stash limit, I would prefer them to allow perk cards to work with stash boxes rather than increase the limit.
---
Apparently they aren't real.  Still haven't stated how many hours your brother has.  You have 600, and your xbox apparently has some.  It takes more than 1 to have an average.  Silly numbers... always getting in the way.
---
Why would you think someone else has had bad luck?  Do you also assume, along with your average 8, that I have 0?  Where do all these numbers come from??  You're pulling them out of thin air, thats where.
---
Most likely you aren't a duper.  Most people like I assume you did, bought them off of someone who was obviously a duper.  You don't want to loose your weapons which I understand.  But you should.  Because they weren't obtained legitimately.
---
Precisely. It’s like we paid full price for a game in Alpha, and we weren’t told. And live service almost seems exactly what fallout is. On the French YouTube there was a video released by Beth’s ceo, that they “built the game to be changed week to week and month to month.”
---
Wallace is better than grahm. His voice is so comforting.
---
Truth. I was in a big tribe on a public PvE server back when Ragnarok was new. That was good times. I miss my griffin.
---
Wouldn’t be the first time they didn’t prepare the build for multiplayer to industry standards. 
---
I hear what you're saying and I don't think there's much disagreement. I guess you could say that I'm fairly doubtful that the atom store is generating enough ongoing revenue to fund a robust dev team.
---
It's also important to remember that ESO as an MMO has a much larger and longer tail than typical AAA releases. They also were well poised to make the jump to F2P and did so at a time when the product was stable and polished. If fo76 goes f2p people will lose their minds around here. 
---
No disrespect but it is an online multiplayer game. This is a pretty normal thing. Maybe they were rp as raiders. Maybe they were bored. Maybe the were instigating pvp or maybe they wanted free junk
---
You have to get to "the good" first though. The game released as "the bad"
---
I'm doing the exact same thing, scrapped 10 so far and best thing I've got is a hardened receiver looking for q auto, The grind for screws n gears is real
---
Oh ok, I'll buy.
---
I'll take 500 caps worth
---
This incident was on PC so probably not.
---
Or maybe you found a way to sell them for 20 caps
---
What masks my friend?
---
Tbh, this mess shouldn’t even have existed in the first place lol. They are the ones who should thank the players for sticking with them throughout this roller coaster of a game,
---
“immersive” 
---
i don’t know about you but i get ripped out of my immersion when the game crashes, t-posing enemies, gun that do no damage, last gen graphics,warped wide screen, and enemies appearing out of nowhere all unceasingly assault me.    you can have your opinions, but its my opinion that you have bafflingly low requirements for immersive.
---
  I also think that this post is an example of tribalism at its best.
---
I typically avoid other players for this kind of thing. I’m lvl 50 now but back when I was a wee lvl 7 I recall going into the airport in Morgan town to complete some quests there. I had been in there once prior so I already had an idea of the enemy layout. I get up to the second floor in the lobbyish area with the crashed vertibird where a few waves of Scorched typically spawn. To my surprise I walked into a level 40+ guy wearing that tricentennial pip boy outfit leading the charge. I proceed to lend a hand with the scorched killing when 2 of his buddy’s show up. The 3 of them proceeded to waste all of their ammo on me. I tried to ignore them but even with drastically reduced damage from them by not engaging it didn’t take long for them to cause me to use up all my stimpacks just to stay alive. Finally I lost my nerve and took out one with a shotgun and then was quickly killed and lost my loot.  It’s still my only PVP kill lol.
---
So yeah, fuck all y’all griefers. Go play something else and let me scavenge! To be fair, this was the only encounter I have had like that in a 100 hours or so of playing. But still tho, fuck those guys!
---
I just wish it had a campaign, I cant do sandbox.
---
Yeah but that ruins everyone's cookie-cutter glass cannon builds. It's so sad 
---
Radsponge + ghoulish makes my group absolutely unkillable in nuke zones. 
---
If Wallace randomly showed up at my camp, I'd probably like him even more. 😃
---
He's my favorite robot in the game.
---
I wish I got something when someone attacks my back porch. Sometimes a cuddle afterwards just doesn’t do it. 
---
This makes me laugh and then cry. It's so true ;-(
---
80 hours into the game and only level 64, and I only just a week ago teamed up with another player. He was a predominantly solo player as well. We actually had a good time doing quests together and helping each other out. 
---
Pleasure doing business. Have fun!
---
"Omg why am I sitting down!? I was trying to grab the gun...OH GOD IT'S EATING MY FACE!"
---
Poor souls. Close the door behind you and end up sitting on the bench outside the doorway. 
---
$20 is nothing sadly. 
---
So I have played a mouth harp early on in this game.  It was at the band set up at the Morgantown airport, I think.  I was disappointed it was not part of "Wind Instruments".  I returned to the Morgantown airport to confirm that this instrument was there and I can't find it.  Has anyone else seen the mouth harp?
---
You can cheat with the stair beam trick but it acts a bit wonky with attached walls.
---
Angry Joe gave Fallout 4 an 8/10 and praised it for various things that the public hated. I'm pretty sure he turned so hard against FO76 for two reasons: First, he saw the build-up of angst toward the title and knew that if he gave it a warm or moderate score he would be shunned and lose viewers/revenue. Second, at the end of his FO4 review he basically gave Bethesda a kind of light 'warning' that they need to change their engine and innovate more and add more interesting side content, so when 76 turned out to be very much more of the same engine and gameplay systems, as well as having \*less\* story-based side questing, he lost his shit. Straight-up lost it.
---
I mean his FO76 review is filled with cherry-picking and misleading criticisms and memes, there's barely any honest analysis to it. And the worst part is that he frequently criticizes 76 hard for things that were in FO4, and which he did not treat with any great disdain at that time. 
---
His indignation says it all though... he clearly thinks he's entitled to a better game than he got, and he's legit angry with Bethesda for not providing him with the maverick, industry-changing game he deserves. xD
---
I honestly don't think I'd trust another review from him. And it's not because he dislikes the game and gave it a bad score, it's because he went so far over the edge that his analysis of 76's strengths and weaknesses was dogshit bad. He didn't approach the game with a neutral outlook, he approached it with unreasonable personal expectations and tangible bias.
---
I can't trust someone to be an honest reviewer when they take ideological backflips like this, haha.  
---
Anything that drains AP drains them faster.
---
Vats and power attacks will suck them dry.
---
I do a whitesprings run power attacking everything and i go thru half a core
---
It's sad that it's normal though. It's not like a level 6 is going to have junk worth killing them over and I get being bored, but maybe it would be better to go pick on people of equal level than those that clearly can't fight back.
---
Massive life saver dude, thanks! 
---
Yea I'm aware that some weapons just eat through ammo but my point was travel with what you need not lugging everything. The lmgs melt through the ammo. I'd advise giving gatling gun a go if u like the lmg feel but hate the ammo consumption
---
For me it's springs, but I just found a place.
---
Junkpile solves all my gear needs, screws I have a plenty, it's those damn springs...
---
Only seen the owl in pics
---
The first Two-Shot Explosive weapons were selling for upwards of 80,000 caps. It was only when the dupers flooded the market that the price plummeted.
---
I understand all that.  That would be precisely why they need to change (read: update the game) the way it's done to eliminate these loopholes.
---
Plenty of games don't have such pervasive duping due to such poorly designed character saves.  FO76 can too.  
---
If you look above at my post, i did say if they managed to fix the duping, that would be the first step to having an economy so.. we're in agreement.

normal o the second faschnach mask ? 
---
From experience, it's definitely more fun to make a new character with a different build. I just got my second character to level 80 and I'm debating on making another new character now.
---
Not everyone has had the same experience you have. And perhaps our tolerance for bugs is tempered from knowledge about what it takes to make a game or mod it, but it's not much more buggy than most other modern Fallout games in my experience. I've logged in pretty much every day, and can easily go hours without encountering a bug or crashing. But I've also had days where it's pretty bad, but, then FO4 and FO3 were like this too. 
---
I asked here cause for me it doesn't stack at all xD. As you I tried to the ground multiple times with and without the cards. But maybe could be a visual bug. I mean you don't see it but it happens. Don't know if you can understand me
---
Or som new mask?
---
I never liked Angry Joe, he seems dishonest about what he says and just repeats what the community is talking about currently.
---
TSE doesnt kill the queen in 30 seconds. shes actualyl very resistant to explosive damage. exploting bobbleheads does.
---
I have one with dildo nose
---
Ahh never realized they cant be sold and would always be surprised it was in my inventory but rarely saw it in my items.
---
Currently doing that in the NE. Just looking to see what is up here. Lots of random not marked stuff. 
---
Nice. If you're on PC I could replenish your .50 Cal ammo.
---
Small letters is not the expensive one. That's I think signs and letters, not small letters. Small letters drops much more often, I have 3 of them 
---
Okay, I like the sound of that, maybe the game does have a chance.
---
It was late and we didn't want to commit to anything because the server was super laggy and weird stuff was happening.
---
Yikes good luck man, I've heard someone found it on their second try one time! I swear I hate knowing there are people luckier than us, but keep pressing on it will eventually come to you.
---
&gt; Sadly corporate world wins out. Most of the time.
---
That isn't really a bad thing in itself. The corporate side is necessary for a business to function and stay functioning. No money coming in, how can the business operate?
---
It would be nice if the creative side had all the time they need to do what they want to do, but that isn't always practical.
---
That said, I don't think Bethesda would have really suffered if they delayed a bit, and if it was indeed corporate pushing them for a release, then yeah, in this case, it was a bad decision, but we shouldn't just automatically blame the corporate side of a business. Because that is what game development is, a business.
---
I think they were referring to you building in your team mates base, which is possible... it just isn't what people wanted or expected
---
No this is Patrick.
---
If you're melee just grab all of the DR/ER perks and mutations, it'll give you like 250 of each? That should be plenty with a hazmat for nuke zones.
---
Hmmmmmmmmm

I should have a new Fallout 76 video tomorrow... I had to take a break from the game because I had a new baby which made recording multiplayer games difficult.
---
put them to extinction like the Neanderthals!!! hahah
---
Well as an Xbox player every 20 minutes I am hitting dehydrated as well.  It seems regardless of what I drink and I don't use chems.  This has been effecting me since the last hotfix.
---
Yes, and a functioning mag rack. Thats essentially what im holding out for. Though i may need to free the space and hunt them down when its more viable.
---
Daily front page troll.  Fight me!
---
Blood Mess in Luck will also increase the damage. And every point of strength will give you +5% damage. So stuff like Radicool and Solar Powered etc. will boost your damage. Then there's Nerd Rage and Adrenaline for more damage. If you have Unyielding pieces and don't mind having high rads and low health you can get the damage pretty high even without a bloodied weapon.
---
You will be giving me all of this
---
Pure cobalt flux (1)
---
Pure crimson flux (1)
---
Pure fluorescent flux (1)
---
Pure violet flux (1)
---
Pure yellowcake flux (1)
---
For 50 caps. 
---
And I'm saying you cant compare it to call of duty
---
agreed.
---
Yes sir! I am happy that they haven't just abandoning the game but in terms of product satisfaction I feel they still have work to do to earn that original $60.
---
There are 3 Topics about eBay rules.
---
-Copyright Rights
---
-List Practice (eBays own Rules)
---
-Prohibited Items (There are your laws)
---
List Practice is for this case the reason to remove such items, when we know these are with fraudly background and created with a exploit or other such a methode isnt allowed ! 
---
Sure there are so many accounts, because its not against eBay rules direct you are right. You know what is against the rules ? Trying to scam others with the "Give me your PW and Account" and you pay methode ! 
---
Its not enforced directly, so even with my efforts its hard to fight against them all ! And btw, just because the seller still exists dosnt mean we didnt restricted his account buddy ;) 
---
That's usually how it happens. Business people are fucking morons when it comes to understanding how long coding things and testing can take.
---
I doubt this game ever hit any form of UAT other than the tiny beta they had.
---
I'm against the idea. I got mine from a drop I killed myself. Its not on the best category weapon, but I got it legit. Maybe I would support deletion of duplicates in the same inventory when there are 3 or more of the same legendary object type rolled into a stack or however it works. But even then I dont like it.
---
I would only support item wipes if they wipe all items for all players.
---
Lore wise it wouldn't make sense, not that any of the lore in this game makes sense so hey, why not? I'd be down to be one-shot by a high level nightkin.
---
Refined comes close to hardened but ultimately those receivers are for ammo reasons, not damage
---
Don't praise corperations for bandaid fixing a fuck up they never should have made in the first place
---
So that explains it, I was wondering why it wasn't jumping..lol, and I blow myself up a lot so its in my stash, the power fist is nice, it also has the faster swing speed, but I cannot remember the 3 perk, will check when I get in game
---
I'll log in later today, and post the numbers. I haven't logged since monday, so I don't remember off the top of my head right now. If I can find a SB, I might try to get a video of the kill to show it.
---
Completely agree with the passive abilities. I've posted that many times on here as well. 
---
While I somewhat agree with finality...I also disagree. The fact that I can't share items and learned plans between characters is a bit of a bummer. 
---
Also, I worked hard on my melee character and while it's near perfect, I would like to try a few different gun builds which require completely different skills. Meaning I would have to level nearly 50 more times just to TRY it out..and then however many more times to tweak it. Multiply that by however many builds you want to try and you begin to see my point. It will become tedious and monotonous and many people (me included) will just quit the game because it's too much of a hassle to level another 100+ levels to just try new builds out. The process is flawed in that respect and I really feel that the ability to respec ALL your points at once is the best solution. It gives us freedom to try out new things and explore new abilities...
---
eb games still exists?
---
So you’ve found more tse than just explosive...?
---
Tell me about it. Level 45 excavator power armor... 49 springs per leg. Sugar grove and fort mclintock are great places. 
---
Yes. And I too was disappointed you couldn't build one.
---
You aren't responding to either of these guys points and are instead making up points that are easier to attack because you don't know how to argue. 
---
Nobody told you not to like fallout, stop telling others to calm down when you're freaking out over others having a different opinion than you. 
---

---
Bobble heads are kinda the new thing huh? Same problem. Dupe fix full inventory wipe. I suppose even the guy with 20k steel is an issue.
---
Take Poseidon Energy for example. I cant stay on a server long enough to get more than a couple cores.
---
The time for "trying" is called "Beta". Bethesda chose to stop "trying" and move to "release".
---
IMO, Bethesda are pieces of shit until they provide proper online functionality and/or release a dedicated server so that I can host a local server for my wife and I to play co-op on.
---
Their CAMP was within shouting distance of Watoga Station, so when they killed us - yes, several times - we just respawned there and could go right back to it. They were either too stupid or too distracted to notice the blast zone was right on top of them until the last seconds. All I saw was their castle despawning about 15 seconds before the nuke hit, then we were killed by it too, so I have no idea if all of them got out in time.
---
Came here looking for this specifically. All the other stuff is pretty good for the most part, but I can't RP as a tank with my mk. 19 weighing 20 pounds... 
---
That is definitively good tier. I found one just like it and gave it to my friend for his melee rad rage unyeilding build. He on shots everything shy of the queen. It's disgusting.
---
Be it Facebook, twitter, YouTube or hell even reddit.
---
Outrage baiting generates a ton of ad revenue. 
---
They won't be able to ban people who duped but didn't make vids because they have no way of seeing characters from their side. Best thing you could do is lure dupers put to buy something from them and then get vids or screen shots of them having impossible amounts of items and then sending that info to Bethesda who could then use that info to ban the person. The one good thing about this game showing your gamer tag and not character name.
---
Lol what?
---
I think the real mistake was not having npcs and a better story. That would have been sufficient for me, we know it's a spinoff and not supposed to be Fallout 5, but it's definitely missing an impactful story. I don't really care about defeating the sbq if it means no actual lives in the map are actually affected, they're all dead.
---
Good lawd! Thats like 100 more damage than mine! (No rifle dmg perks)
---
You sound 1000% more condescending and passive aggressive than anyone in this thread, get yourself some self awareness and calm down. 
---
He’s a shitty contractor’s wet dream.  
---
They can fuck up immensely, still get paid, not fix it for several months and when they do eventually fix it he’ll shower them with praise and ask them to do more work.
---
Is the video link still up? I don’t see it anywhere. 
---
Not just software projects, I'd wager this happens in every professional field.
---
Hey, I have a bridge. Wanna buy it?
---
good. hopefully they take it all the way. As many as can be found.
---
Sorry for hijacking the comment but would you mind leading me to that plans farming post? Will appreciate it a lot!

I've been told the radius of explosion perk grenedier does not apply to the explosive legendary effect.  Demolitionist for damage does though.
---
Anyone reading this, has anyone found a way to fix the lighting? Does anyone else have light sources stretch out horizontally and kinda go over nearby objects like trees, etc? It messes with my eyes and I can't find a way to fix it. 
---
Things are going to get real when players can get elected President.
---
What do you mean player behavior because my inventory is underweight as well as my stash it's just whenever I move anything from my inventory to my stash
---
I know what you mean, bit of a lore-head myself, but its not like they bought the franchise and just decided they weren't going to change anything, I think thats obvious. Its just that super mutants are currently pretty boring and need to stand out a bit better for what they are. 
---
Grahm is a new player's best friend. I was level 12 and running around like a madlad in Watoga when Grahm shows up and murders every enemy chasing me. I gained like six levels just following Grahm around, aggroing/tagging mobs and luring them back for him to execute. It was one of the best times I've had in-game, truly!
---
I agree with you I am a massive lover of PvP games and play 76 consistently if there is no quests left to do and your bored why not have a good time by getting your bounty up this game may have restricted PvP but it's still PvP so people shouldn't complain about greifers
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/gXXISpG](https://imgur.com/gallery/gXXISpG) this 
---
Seriously, i have almost 150 hrs in this game and haven't done all quests. RDR2 i finished in like 40 hrs and never played again.
---
I finished my build and was happy with it, no mutations, then got a TSE gatling from a friend.
---
Which means I need: Mutation perks (5-6 points) Explosive perks (5-7 points) and Heavy perks (12-16) along with adjusting my special (a lot more into luck, int, and str)
---
So after acquiring a cool new weapon I want to use, I'm looking at about a minimum of 30(!) levels before I can be effective with it. (Yes I consider mutations basically necessary to use explosive weapons without SDing fairly frequently. Even without these, it's still 20-25 levels)
---
At that point I may as well just make a new character.
---
This would sting a lot less if I hadn't had 15-20 duplicate perk cards in the process of leveling. (Not even 1star variants of 3star perks. I mean extra 1star perks that just disappear into nothingness.)
---
I'd be fine if it cost 25k caps, but there should be *some* way to respec special points beyond the option to move one per level *or* a perk card.
---
While I agree it has potential I completely disagree with thanking them.
---
The higher ups at Bethesda should face all the wraith we throw their way. Maybe it will shame them into not making another monumental screw up down the road. (I've worked deving software so I really doubt the higher ups will shoulder any blame. They never do.)
---
I really appreciate the fact that they listen to the community. This most recent patch really shows that our ideas are being heard 
---
been trying the flooded trainyard east of watoga.
---
4-6 yaoguais spawn there (usually), drop yogi steaks and 5 springs each
---
Bots, brigadeing, pr firms, china/other markets where this scummy mtx shit is the norm.
---
Nice, those i have not seen 
---
It doesn't instantly solve the problem, but it's one source of many that may provide additional relief for legitimate players. 
---
They shouldnt need to remove them. Just increase the max level to 100 once duping is completly fixed (if it ever is)
---
They should focus on buffing other legendary abilities instead of nerfing everything. But yea I guess they could nerf rhe TSE weapons just a bit but dont ive do it.
---
Yeah for demolition expert I knew it. Thanks tho!
---

Lmao I'll tell you what I wouldn't do, I wouldn't go to reddit just to bitch about it lol. Get over it princess, level up so you can defend yourself. If it's THAT big of a deal just stop playing. If you're looking for everyone to agree with you or tell you you're right then you're just wasting your time. I'm sure most of them feel the same as me about this topic
---
&gt;faschnacht
---
I found that one in the asylum during a Brotherhood of Steel mission, but it only appeared once. 
---
I found a giant chipmunk suit in a campground somewhere, and I've seen others. some are rare appearances
---
They are way faster now after patch
---
If they had even the most basic of things like storage containers, I would say the game is at an ok release state. Instead, Bethesda is being praised for making Bobby pins weigh less than a pound each months after release.
---
I think that's part of the problem- FO4 made me a hoarder. It was tough sledding the first few months with 76 when i just grabbed everything, but I've been able to rein myself in quite a bit and now I really don't mind the stash limit. I still have to toss .38 ammo every once in a while because I just grab it by instinct.
---
Skyrim’s one of the biggest selling games ever isn’t it?
---
Are you thinking of the vendor in the town itself or the train station?
---
Found two separate plans for excavator at static spawns and at a vendor in less than 30 minutes last week.  No joke. 
---
I record non-recipe plans found outside of containers or as event rewards...
---
PLAN - Excavator Motion-Assist Servos : Red Rocket Filling Station, on counter next to STASH
---
PLAN - Excavator Kinetic Servos: Camden Park, Vendor Bot Chad.
---
I am affable to the affirmation of the previous affirmation and its agreement.
---
Oh hell yes can i have some? psn name’s Enlighteninq
---
Or used the “Early Access” tag
---
Yea I have the rifle perks and the 2.5 sneak so it will do over 500 damage when I am running the stealth build
---
Press vs hold.
---
Its that way as the pc version is a console port.
---
That behaviour is common.
---
I said playable. You can play the game. I didn’t say it was perfect or flawless. But keep using names to validate your impotent rage. 
---
ohhh... a nice on to, fat and a lot of meat on that one :D
---
interesting, the bad thing is that some have taken advantage and have achieved things without effort
---
 getting plans and impossible things for us 
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/gXXISpG](https://imgur.com/gallery/gXXISpG)   
---
that explains how people have achieved this for example 
---
Get off work, race home looking forward to playing, run around doing daily vendor sale, wife calls on her way home, log off for night.
---
But do you have the plans for the Bladed Commie Wacker? That's the real endgame.

You get 4 in just a few minutes now. Band aid fix

Ah, my old spot. Moved to another spot with lead and water (no water fall, but it's a pretty little stream) since it seems that spot is becoming more well known. Loved that spot.

---
Also let us make generic selections for the quick wheel; e.g. closest to spoiling raw/cooked/any food/meat/veg, closest to spoiling drink, etc. 
---
Fair enough. That in all honesty felt like a bit of reality check. I can tell you this much, I've tried to be active in four to five different subs (in a real way, not sounding condescending when i discuss things. ) then one person or a mod hijacks the entire comment thread and it becomes insanely toxic. Not saying that in an "oh I'm right and they are wrong" kinda way, at one point I had to ask a mod from whatisthisthing in a dm why he attacked anything that he believed "belonged somewhere else" I think the post in question was someone asking about a kind of snake that but him. He got his answer but shortly after the mod in question locked the post and directed him to whatisthisanimal.
---
 I guess all I'm trying to say is I finally got an attitude last night after being the focus point of yet another person being toxic. Honestly if they would have discussed it a little more and explained themselves I wouldn't have been nearly as upset or rude. It could have gone better. I agree. 
---
actually that's some good shit, I need plastic too.
---
damn fusion cells
---
Oh man, melee builds with 15 strength, full unyielding armor, twisted muscles and talons, nerd rage, and all that jazz, are completely disgusting. Just don't forget incisor. My buddy would mention damage numbers and I'd feel bad for the monsters.
---
If you have turrets, and youre pvping, you just made this game fortnite. In combat? BAM! Blueprinted tower with only 10 rockets planted next to your foe in an instant!
---
I like being the guy that stays on topic. Op created a post about the weapons being mechanically broken and not working as intended. 
---
Your comment is a rant about TSE weapons relating to PVP. You even state that the regular two shots aren't that bad. If you want to complain about the TSEs there are dozens of posts about that. Your comment reads like you read the title and nothing else whether you like it or not.
---
Is there any "clipping" tricks known in this game yet? 
---
Like in fo4 when i Would place everything on a rug or floormat first so i could place things anywhere. 
---
I have problems throwing grenades, always end up doing a bash or power attack instead of throwing the grenade. 
---
What makes it worse is you cant even separate the keybind for all three (bash/power attack/grenade), so you can have grenade bound to a different key.
---
If you're not lv25, then I suggest making your way into Toxic Valley and finding a Raider PA spawn.  You can use that at lv15...  I just don't get why all the Raider PA spawns are way out there.  I server hopped The Crosshair (NW corner of map, NW of the Hemlock Holes) for a complete set of Raider PA, only low levels guarding the spawn location.
---
I actually have a ballpark guess for your SMG and was wondering how close I am. With a vanilla Gatling Plasma (77 damage) I can kill a level 50 SB in about 10-15 seconds so I'm guessing your SMG probably shows around 100 damage.
---
Bethesda Austin is not a multi billion dollar corporation.
---
I'll post it when i get home. I was fumbling so bad i still can't believe i got the picture and didn't accidentally fast travel somewhere   haha
---
The hard work and time they put into this game is definitely appreciated!
---
-cough- getthesandmanperk -cough-
---
Crank that baby up even some more! (Only at night tho)
---
😂
---
But it did though, it had huge sales with each patch on steam, especially the next update, then a successful Xbox launch.
---
 That game has made mega bucks after initial release.
---
Well that's good but it doesn't fix the issue I was talking about.... constant server crashes
---
But if I don't have hacker and lockpick I have to deal with the crushing FOMO when I come up on something I can't access. I can't take the stress.
---
* "maybe the regular ones aren't". 
---
I don't see where the fun with attacking or screwing with lower levels is either, that said it's open season on bounties.

World of Warcraft, Diablo, Ark, Maple Story, Fortnite etc etc have all had mass duping problems at one point or another.  They only people who cry about getting banned for buying duped items are liars who got caught cheating.  The buyers are never indiscriminately banned so long as it was an in game transaction.
---
I agree. And the posts have been quite similar.
---
No, just 50 Cal or hardened

What’s the dev room and how do people even get there
---
Have never seen an weapon with exploding drop yet, almost lvl 110.. farm something somewhere every day :(
---
3 easy to access lvl 3 locks in harpers ferry I check everyday on my selling runs.  Those chests usually have either a highly molded gun (which sells nicely) or a plan.
---
I call BS that they have same loot as a lvl 0 chest.
---
I can agree that it doesnt really make it worth while to sink 3 points into and should be static song as you have x amount of perception
---
Lmao at using turrets to finish kills at whitesprings 
---
Put on power armor and get a 2h melee weapon without perks and you can solo the clubhouse with no skill required
---
I want them to be able to be equipped. (There was a mod in fo4). Have a Mr T looking heavy gun character named Sarge that would be completed with a cigar hanging from his mouth.
---
I get that, but using multiple of any bobblehead was absolutely not stacking when I tried it. Seems like a false alarm to me
---
The data record shows that you should have a 100% chance to learn the recipe for crafting the Marine Armor Helmet if you scrap one. So, if you have one or more of them, scrap one and see if you learn it. If you learn it, you can spread them throughout the game and get everyone the helmet they really want!
---
I thought I had, but after checking my challenge board I realized I don't have violet checked off. That's lame D:
---
Well yeah it is a balance game, but as a Graphic Designer I know all too well. I need this much time to do this and this, only to get you got less then half the time you wanted to get done.
---
That seemed worse. Might have been dupers trying weird stuff, but not happy about it.
---
Hacking and Lockpicking are QoL tools, not just to open containers, but to also create shortcuts
---
There's no difference between press vs. hold for me. As soon as I press the Alt key the grenade loads up (I can hear the click noise). 
---
I mean it would still be dumb if it worked that way, since one can easily press when intending to hold and vice-versa, but yea, when I try to power attack if a grenade is equipped, you best believe it's gonna arm. xD
---
This has probably been asked a bunch already, but id love to surprise my brother with one. Where can you find that snazzy domepiece?
---
(Im on ps4)
---
Well I have no idea.  So I cant say either way and I traded though an in game trade with everything on the up and up as far as I know. So if it gets deleted then I better get my caps back.
---
Dont fucking hate on me because I took advantage of the trading system.  I've abided by the rules.
---
I really expected this tbh. Like how in Skyrim the mages, warrior and thief guilds just keep handing out little quests. I don't think they have any end?

I have sold game items on ebay since the 90s.. diablo 2, diablo 3, final fantasy 11 was last game i sold stuff on.
---
I have never seen a listing asking for account or password information.. they usually either ask the players playtime / appt time, or they state the days and time they can deliver..
---
If thats happening now that would really surprise the hell out of me and also make me wonder who in their right mind would give the keys of the kingdom to some random ebay seller.. thats just odd..
---
I read some articles about  people getting temp or perma-banned for getting into the room. They were taking items out of it (because there is EVERYTHING), and some people were even creating false mule accounts to sacrifice to the BAN, so they could at east transfer items to a legit account before the ban hit.. crazy stuff!
---
YMMV As I used power armour frequently in this time but it’s a massive difference compared to how quickly it needs replacing normally (and how frequently my melee weapons need repairing, I’m looking at you All Rise!)
---
Ill happily provide mats for it, IGN Nezedia
---
How could you possibly interpret my words as passive aggressive and in the same breath tell me to calm down? You should take your own advice.
---
Yep I use it on all my combat armor and I got the plans for the arms, legs, and chest from griffin station.
---
Several sites are reporting it PC gamer is one of them
---
Yeah bloodied can get you into ridiculous damage (well over 1000), with the trade off of dying more frequently. Otherwise go with these other options listed
---
&gt; My point was that not all insults are childish or undeserved.
---
Yet somehow it's always the other guy who is being childish and somehow the other guy is the one who deserves the insults. 
---
&gt;  If you didn't want to debate it then why the fuck did you waste your time writing not one, but two comments? 
---
I was pointing out the hypocrisy of your statement. Sorry you don't agree. And I don't see it as a waste of my time. Just pointing it out. Ergo, it's not a debate. 
---
&gt; You're calling ME a hypocrite?
---
Yes. I thought I'd made that clear. 
---
&gt; No offense, but let me just say something that I know will offend you, no offense"
---
Some people can take criticism and not see it as a personal insult. Obviously, you can't, which is why I added "I mean no offence". 
---
Its a month old. No thanks
---
There's some consensus that PA and Hazmat suits provide huge rad resist with a hidden value.   
---
With rad resistant regular armor and chems, you can get your rad resist stat into the 1000's temporarily, but you will still take significant rads from a blast zone compared to even the 'damaged' hazmat suits which has a nominal rad resist of 500. If this particular topic doesn't get any traction soon I plan to post a demonstration video.  As is, it's a big FU to non-PA players.

Fallout 76 was my first introduction to the fallout franchise, these are my experiences yours may vary.

My issues are the low storage limit on a game designed around farming mats, it got boosted but i feel not enough.

Speaking of farming mats, your given the recipe to craft leather unfortunately it  needs fibre (which i learned you get from military ammo bags) craft metal you say? Need recipes, level 45 still no chest.

My C.A.M.P used to get stored before that update, its fixed to notify now unfortunately i lost 3 work benches, 6 water purifiers, 5 power generators, some walls, floors an roofs, an all my crops cause the game puts it back into your inventory as food:(
---
Saw a water texture bug (showed ground were there was water) ill get back to that in a sec, shotguns did varying levels of damage an for every 1 melee i hit, the enemy did 3, kinda bad when you have like 10 after you. 
---
After this i gave fallout 3 a go, an encountered the same water texture glitch as well as the shotgun issue, talking to a friend an they inform me that Bethesda kinda don't know  how to do shotguns.
---
Its also quite heavily a team based game (tho thats understandable) enemies tend to respawn faster than the items.
---
Welp thats my rant over.
---
whatever.
---
I'm on PS4, sometimes after I collect, the water wont show up on the loot menu, but will be there if I go into transfer mode.
---
Ugh. The number of times I’ve wanted to throw a grenade from hide, but given my position away because I suddenly grunt and punch the air; or the number of times I’ve wanted to smack something but toss a Molotov at my own feet. So I try and do neither.
---
Congrats with new baby! 
---
Slow clap...Amazing
---
Hell yeah, man. I would pay to see that
---
Hemlock Holes has been 20-30 monsters every time I went there when I was level 20.
---
The only place actual raider power armor had spawned for me was inside the level 3 locked trailer at the Gorge Scrapyard workshop.  Which I only got into because someone had kindly unlocked it and left it open.  
---
Well yeah. Every new game follows the same pattern.
---
Maybe gamers will understand it someday but probably not
---
Very frustrating! With Green Thumb I was able to harvest 18 snap tails, which would be one plant short of TWO violet flux if the plants mutated and you could harvest crackle tail. Every type would be available at the Whitespring area if this section weren't bugged. And with a friend or two and a shared Green Thumb card, you could make several. Oh well.
---
Nothing worse than picking a level 3 lock and getting a wrench.   Then again, I notice that this mostly happens with things like luggage and tool boxes rather than safes.  Safes usually have a couple of good items.  
---
Sometimes I think that it’s just the super mutants locking up their favorite item and then losing the keys.   
---
I totally forgot about bash too. Yea, it can be really frustrating!
---
Correct, because Scorchbeasts are the source of scorching.  They are not scorched, because they did not have scorching done upon them, but they are scorchers, which is what turned the scorched into scorched.
---
This messages is pissing me off... can't even play the game.  It gives me this damn message while loading!
---
lol thanks, this is baby number 4 :P
---
Every locked level 2 or 3 safe I have picked (inside of Whitespring) has generated a random plan. So your comment there is incorrect. 
---
They increased it but they gonne back to a very fast TTK becouse the community wasn't happy with the change i personaly really love a Quick more lethal TTK 
---
idc what others say i support your opinion. 
---
I swear people make these posts just to get gold/silver etc.
---
Doesn’t hazmat suit enequip your armor pieces?
---
That was awesome, I fucking love your bos themed camps over those sims looking cliff houses. I've been trying very hard to make more faction themed workshops and been struggling with the lack of military looking CAMP items, I'm going to steal some ideas
---
It's like you never played a Bethesda game, or a first time released mmo before, kid.
---
However your super easy, not vague at all, solutions you provide lead me to think you've worked with every AAA company in the world.
---
Please. Provide aid to us, those without the use of hindsight, at how everything can be perfect. Surely only you're genius can save us in this time of need.
---
Lol, thought maybe it would be a junkie pipe rifle or something bad. Nice roll!
---
Yeah I dropped dead for no apparent reason three times yesterday. Wasn't in combat, no mobs or players around.
---
its in zenimax's tos, yes.
---
What are you playing on? I hate on PS4 you can only save about 40 pictures. It should allow unlimited. Don't you think?
---
Very rarely, but it happens, they probably just reduced addiction rates for some reason. I run with chem fiend spamming psychobuff everywhere and have only gotten addicted maybe 3 times as far as I remember.
---
You missed permanent bans for adding mods to make the UI functional. 
---
I'd love a full on settlement based DLC or something along those lines.
---
That's the real question here, are they banning only Youtube dupers and others who have posted undeniable proof of duping, or do they have some way to track it internally and are going to ban *every* duper. Either way it's a step in the right direction, it'll just be a bit of a shame if it's only the Youtubers while the rest get off scot free. I've seen random no-name players who took duping *way* farther than any Youtuber likely did.
---
The lore behind the super mutants in WV is pretty fucking weak, bit strange why West-Tek was using FEV in the first place, but they would definitely spice things up a bit on their side, especially if we could talk to one of them like Davison and Keene
---
&gt;Inb4 New Vegas worshippers come bite at you for writing Lucky 88.  
---
*breaths in*  REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
How do I download the new patch? Or has it not released for PS4 yet? Thanks. 
---
Can you make some for me so I can learn it please?
---
Mind if I ask where you're getting screws?
---
Sugar Grove and Camp McClintock should meet all your spring needs.
---
It’s a human npc in the dev room
---
Go to falloutbuilds.com and fill out your preferred build. Once you’re done there’s an option that tells you what cards and specials to pick for each level
---
Oh, I can defend myself easily. My issue is people harassing new players and giving them a bad impression of a game they're probably already hesitant to play.
---
Oh my god yes, there is literally so much more in the game now.
---
I have 6 charisma and 3 hard bargain 
---
With grape mentats I get 5caps
---
They wanted it to release on Reclamation Day. Marketing was likely very insistent on that. Hold off and you've got a year to wait for people to get that "unique" release day vibe.
---
I look forward to it’s future too, but I’m just pointing out that they’ve been really shitty as a company recently and that personally I don’t feel they deserve much praise for finishing a game that should’ve been finished in the first place
---
I also upvote everyone who participates in the conversation
---
You the MVP &lt;3 Thanks so much!! Good day and cheers :)
---
But huntington is in the game? it was has a mini story too it that was a bit messed up.
---
I'm sure OP did all those things pre and post patch. OPs behavior probably didnt radically change on the same day. Probably.
---
Heh, put out a non-"Bear Proof" can.  If you put meat in it, it has a chance of spawning a friendly yao-gui.
---
Not comparing burglary to exploiting. The logic is what i'm comparing. 
---
I think its time to admit that it wasn't because of the dupers...
---
The dude streaming for Nukacrypt is hilarious. He's obviously not used to having this amount of viewers, after getting sudden attention when the nukes stopped firing at new years.
---
glitches arent features
---
I'm with you, the ALT key is just dead to me in this game. Don't think I've ever touched it.
---
Ok then it doesn't stuck I guess. Thanks!
---
Yeah but that is assuming they don’t play the game at all and accumulate other stuff to sell
---
It's not every single day. But to answer your question, people hate on FO76 every single day on various media platforms. So why does it surprise you that there are frequent responses to that hate?
---
I don't understand the need to make this post, as I didn't understand the need to make the post you are mocking.
---
Are you okay, OP?
---
Meh. Speaking as a trial lawyer (my day job) rather than a gamer: 
---
As litigation goes, this actually isn't very expensive: The TOC/EULA documents are all written to spectacularly favor the company, as always, and the cost of defending against such cases is so high that essentially everyone who's sued immediately capitulates and agrees to a deal wherein they consent to a permanent injunction promising to sin no more on penalty of contempt of court, plus payment of court costs (which includes the biggest out of pocket expense, which will be filing fees), and maybe even some legal fees on top of that. A bunch of gamers, as a group, aren't very solvent, and they're never going to recover on any big damage awards even if awarded by default; but on the other hand, you're usually looking at people who have left a paper trail via their credit card purchases, so they're not impossible to find or to inconvenience greatly by these lawsuits. And yes, if you do them in bulk (no plastic wrap required!), you can cut the cost-per-suit substantially. 
---
Aw man now I can't afford the 20 dollar reskinned emotes bundle when it comes back for Christmas! I really wanted it too, it had great value.
---
Mmm. Super mutants are the best for dialogue.
---
Best solution I have seen so far is to just make the lock picking/hacking skill (1/2/3) passive and the bonus sweet spot the active.
---
I dont think you understood. If the 60/hr were true, I would at least have 120 water with the 4 industrials alone. The numbers on the building menu are completely wrong. 
---
Im on ps4 aswell. I had no idea there was a limit. Thanks for the heads up
---
She's not a jerk! Her name is Bubbles! (I'm kidding I know that's the term)
---
Nice find, didnt actually think they had included that helmet in game.
---
Inventory and base building are touchy now. Seems like they are hacking the code to bits trying to fix stuff. Cant blame the dupers for trying I guess. Seems like an underestimation on Bethesda part
---
I never said they couldn't.  I said I was curious about it, and wanted to see how they would defend it.  It was pretty much what I expected.
---
I can return the game and play something else, and not be a victim.
---
Wonder the same.
---
You have a better chance if you completely repair the cooling system at any power plant. Helped a friend last night and he got first try at Poseidon, just an FYI 
---
It's a good game to play solo.
---
But I would never describe it as immersive...
---
I don't disagree... But I'm a fan of Cricket for bringing me Spray n' Pray in Fallout 4.
---
It's inertial dampening frill.
---
lol wow that is crazy, I will have to level up these perks and switch some around and try this out, I am lvl 120 now so leveling is slower but will definately see about changing to this kind of build 
---
Not really 308 hardened does more than damage then any 50 caliber receiver 
---
People are saying Metal Gear Survive was a better game.
---
Metal Gear Survive.
---
That Zombie Game that looks like it's straight outta 2014 Steam Early Access.
---
It's actually insulting. This game is at least *competent* and *playable*.
---
I’ll add you in a bit. 
---
You could always just re-spec instead of outright scrapping 🤷 might save you some time if you really don't want the support char
---
Counterpoint: this method takes forever and consumes a TON of inventory space, doesn’t net you 1800 caps per hour.
---
Here are easier methods:
---
Farm the marine tactical helmet plan.  Craft helms.  Win.
---
Pick up golf skirts and golf outfits. 
---
Kill robots at watoga.  Loot random items while searching city. 
---
All three are more efficient.
---
Is your friend a YouTuber? Just wondering why he was targeted since recent news is indicating tat YTers are getting banned finally.
---
All of them.
---
Exactly this. Have your fun, but let’s not pretend this game wasn’t a shit show for all of us starting out. 
---
So? I already know all of that. All Im saying is that the "Value" section on the inventory is not the selling price for vendors
---
Try again kiddo
---
Are you saying TotalBiscuit wouldn't of called 76 trash? L M A O
---
I mean that I am joking and you aren’t offended, which is nice
---
It went right over his head.
---
Now ban the dupers 
---
Yeah sounds good, if you see me on send me an invite later today or tomorrow.
---
Another lover of the classics, I see
---
The game is literally, Pay to Win.
---
Really. I will have to go check that out. I've yet to pick a lock in that place yet.
---
Idk if I agree with consequences for it, but I definitely agree with the idea of not being able to do certain activities in game that should be pvp driven events ect ect.... 
---
haha will that work with the crossbow?
---
No idea but I think I'm the first person to learn a recipe for it.
---
Which is why they should allow for full Respec for caps that costs progressively more each time.  You shouldn't be able to do as often as you want for free because that can be exploited.
---
Dress me like a sailor and call me your scooner boy. #anchorsaway
---
DAE THINK FALLOUT 76 IS ACTUALLY GOOD??? silver x19 gold x7
---
i know it's an unpopular opinion to like a game IN THE GAME'S OWN SUBREDDIT but gosh darn it i am so tired of being the only one who enjoys this game!!! rise up gamers!!!!!!!!!!
---
I'm calling BS on the one-shot claim. I have several perk cards dedicated to Two-Handed weapons, bonus dmg against glowing enemies, PA mods that increase strength, a level 50 2* Grognak Axe, and the pain train perk. Even after pain train-ing those ghouls and a power attack they don't die.
---
I love it there’s also a tse harpoon gun that I traded for which is the only thing they could be suspect
---
And that’s a perfect example of how out of touch and ridiculous the mentality of anti dupers is. They act like this video game is some sacred artifact that’s purity has to be preserved at all cost. It’s a video game. It’s not someone’s crux of their life like a home is. 
---
I agree pacifist shouldnt be able to take loot from dropped players, in fact it would be cool if you got the option to pvp someone that took your stuff even if they never attacked you. I dont think pacifist matters in workshop areas because they are pvp areas by default when trying to claim them
---
This game is too easy just pick the appropriate part cards that you get to level up your heavy weapons and rifles and whatever perks go along with us
---
Pls stahp ppl enjoy this game so nothing else matters
---
You assume Bethesda knows what it’s doing....
---
I don't see the problem here
---
Fake nice try twat
---
&gt; ITS THE DUPERS
---
But the server was empty
---
&gt; JUST BAD LUCK I GUESS BUT MAYBE CROUCHED DUPERS
---
Gymnastics.
---
BETA should have been renamed STRESS TEST.
---
There really is no such thing as beta for AAA games anymore. It's too corporate, big wigs would never let a dev they've dumped millions into come out to the public with a game likely riddled with bugs and ask potential players for help. Maybe Steam greenlight, but not anything with under the big ass corporate umbrella.
---
Literally forget what beta means to you when it comes to big games. 
---
I'm going to guess nothing. If it's been a priority at all, they've sure been tight-lipped about it.
---
Working okay for you after the patch? I fought the queen and it was a nightmare, since the suit breaks in no time and then you have no protection against her large proximity rads and rad attacks.
---
So let's add liver failure perma death for drinking. Just straight up heart attacks for too many drugs. 
---
It only takes one NPC to ruin the experience.
---
Looking at you, Preston.
---
It's good.  But it should have been done on day 1, not months later.
---
The damage is already done.  Hopefully they learned from there numerous mistakes, and do better in their next multiplayer game.  It's hard to imagine that you could do any worse...
---
Maybe to you 
---
This happened to me during the Beta. I even took some pics for friends on my Snap Chat.
---
Just an empty server with only me. I grinded out a few levels and left bored.
---
What I would like to see is them splitting the perk cards in two. So we have passives like picklock and another for active stuff like weapon damage increase.
---
Rude
---
I JUST READ ALL CAPS LOCKED STATEMENTS IN MR. TOURGES VOICE! BLOWJOBS!
---
Imagine having her in your restaurant as a customer. I'd just shut the kitchen down and close up for the day.
---
ah, yeah nah i could care less about what bethesda is doing. you either hate it or u love it. 
---
But haven't they said that they have no way of knowing what each player has, hence the reason they couldn't fix accounts where certain quest items vanished from inventories? If they can see what players have, they have no way of running an algorithm to find duplicates...
---
But so far, I haven't found any short cuts in the game because of these perks. 
---
Hacking lets you open safes that if you don't have the lock picking skills. 
---
No quest needs these to complete. 
---
Nope, just commiserating.
---
They are still fixing bugs that have been in the game since the BETA. I highly doubt there will be fresh content for quite some time. If I were BGS I would prioritize in this order.
---
Bug fixes -&gt;QOL/UI-&gt;New content
---
Imma let you finish but Moira Brown is better in every way you described.
---
I don't think you understood what this person was trying to tell you. The purifiers have a maximum capacity of how much purified water they can hold at a time that is far less than what they can make per hour. For example, regular purifiers can only hold 3 purified water at a time, each. If you don't take those three out, they stop producing until you empty them.
---
How do you find a duper on the map? Like, what gives them away? I haven't come across one that I'm aware of, but a really nice guy gave me 3 TSE weapons today.
---
He had a TSE Shotgun and I asked if he had any other TSE weapons to sell. He just went to his stash and dropped 3 for me.
---
I sincerely hope they weren't duped, but needless to say I am really excited to have them. 
---
I mean, the whole point of Vault 76 was that it wasn't an experiment like the others, but humanity's hope for rebuilding. So...it would be cool to see some progression towards, you know, rebuilding, right?
---
The problem is that they don't even reach the limit.
---
The production is extremely low.
---
Its been 48min now, and not a single purifier reached its storage limit
---
I always think of Dorothy in the poppy fields or Trinity in The Matrix. Get up! Get up!
---
God... That's so sad, it's literally unusable with the current durability, i really hope they fix it at the next update.
---
junkpile extractor in my camp and just picking up all the flip lighters, scissors, fans, typewriters, coffee pots, hot plates, etc.
---
Whether average or typical, you have no idea.  Thats my point.  And what's with "and my xbox account" and "Xbox guy"?  You just got the challenge for 76 hours played? Not 600?
---
I ran with a brotherhood rifle for a long time. Can be crafted from lvl 1-50 comes pretty well maxed outs the box
---
Following. 
---
It’s definitely from the update
---
Agreed. I made a new character hoping for it to be better at end game.
---
Just as crappy
---
Where are the plans for it?
---
Its been 48min now, and not a single purifier reached its storage limit x2
---
There already are horde events. they are more like waves vs giant mob but same idea.
---
I've told precisely zero people to "calm down" (something you apparently have quite a penchant for doing). I made my point and defended it. Sorry, I'm not going to respond to points which distract from the main thrust of my argument. All this goddamn vitreol generated over some guy just saying thanks to Bethesda for putting forth an appreciable effort to fix their game.
---
&gt; “built the game to be changed week to week and month to month.”
---
Well that's a blatant lie. They didn't build anything. They used an existing engine to save money. It's no more changeable than Skyrim or Fallout 4.
---
I’m okay, how are you?
---
Way more disconnects since the jan 10 patch.. before that maybe ones in several days!
---
My biggest issue with this is that if crap guns start to offer better loot, high levels will farm scorched in starting zones since they usually carry a gun.
---
I don't personally have any issues with any junk.  The last time I went to craft something and was missing something, it was because I was a little short on black titanium and couldn't craft the last component of my excavator armor.  It is trivial to learn what junk you need, mark what you need, and pick that stuff up as you play.
---
I got it off a random Scorched using it doing a SBQ fight. If we’re ever able to hang things on the wall/ put in a display case I’m definitely going to show it off.
---
Get down to fort defiance and access the computer to the right of the main enterance and you’ll get em
---
So put players at a disadvantage simply because they don't want to do combat with some body
---
A simple patch would have fixed it months ago. To use your comparison, it’s like hiding valuables in your driveway and getting pissed when they get stolen. I’m curious where Bethesda stated this as a rule and that if it were broken you’d be banned from a game you spent $60 on. If anything Bethesda is stealing from their consumers by kicking them off a game they paid for for exploiting something gay could have been fixed long ago. 
---
You say that, but no one has gotten them 
---
ROFL I am a bully now? This should be a good explanation, cannot wait to hear this, the floor is yours
---
Probs were The hydraulic bracers
---
There’s a black titanium deposit just around the mountain from the Charleston junkyard. I put my camp there, then took the junkyard and spent a few hours around that area and coming back to defend and get plans. Plus plenty of junk that provided springs and screws. It was fun actually. 
---
Same, literally have not met someone who has them
---
I’ve done those but I’m talking about on a much bigger scale
---
I play in pacifist mode cuz a bounty for accidentally shooting someone or their camp is dumb. Plus pvp isn't even close to being balanced. Almost everyone has one shot kill weapons. Vats is built in auto aim. It's not even worth attempting pvp bc it's so broken. My opinion, you shouldn't drop a publicly lootable bag unless you died actively engaged in pvp. 
---
Fridges that keep items from spoiling, and Nuka-Cola machines that can turn beer and nuka cola "Ice-Cold".  
---
Assign a certain weight limit (low, obviously, just enough for 5-8 items each).  You put them in via the normal "stash" like interface.  When you exit the interface it makes it look like those items are there (Kinda like the book shelves in Skyrim).  Sure, you can't physically take it out, but the aesthetic is there...
---
And the obvious - Magazine Rack and Bobblehead Stand
---
sure, i'll give you 5 caps each
---
So I only assume Rippers level caps at 40?
---
Oh yeah, they're stupidity is funny don't get me wrong, but I would like a different take on it that reflects a bit of the original lore, thats all I'm saying. 
---
I have not gone into a nuke zone since patch. 
---
After reading this thread, i plan to bring 2 hazmat suits to the next nuke zone i go to. 
---
Congrats - you've just wasted an hour of your time!  I get that people don't like these bases, but you're only hurting yourself by bothering with them.  Its a terribly inefficient way to farm XP (for them) to begin with - and you just lost an hours worth of playtime that could have gone towards more productive activity.  Hope you feel better - but IMO its precious time wasted for no gain.
---
 You get used to it. A lot of Fallout 4 hours help. ;)
---
You're going to have to take that up with the Grafton mayor.
---
City ordinances, state law, you might need to bring some caps for a bribe.
---
Too bad you can't beat him senseless :)
---
You told on someone? Gross. Snitches get stitches.
---
with the amount of disconnects from lag at the moment in Rad zones and such, i feel like it would just be a wandering disconnect bomb. 
---
Karen took the kids *again*, bro
---
No I'm the detective and I've found your GT... a simple look at /r/fo76marketplace was all that was needed huzzah!!! Lol but seriously why were we finding this guy's GT? 
---
I've never played a game that "a build" was a part of it or such an important part anyway. Like I built my girl as if I were playing fallout 4, I've been trying to respec her for 20 levels n no where near close so I would rather start fresh. 
---
I'm not talking about those games, I'm talking about people being banned who didn't dup. That's all I meant by it. And by the "how far are they gonna take this" because I don't think someone who bought a stimpack or something should be banned because said stimpack was dupped. I could not care less who gets banned. As I can promise it won't affect me. But by all the down votes I guess everyone is just too stupid to see that, but again, I don't care because non of these bans will ever affect me.
---
So is this your admission that you didn't really read the text below the title? Because that's all I really called you out on. Not upset. Just pointing it out. Thanks for all the compliments, btw.
---
&gt; there's not much else to do with plastic anyway
---
My shotgun would like a word with you.
---
cool! thanks dude
---
Are you removing the water as it is produced?
---
Also, there is sometimes a graphical glitch that doesn't show the correct count when you just hover over it with your pointer. Sometimes if you hit the Transfer button, it shows a higher number in the actual inventory of the purifier.
---
Haha that's hilarious from someone with your username. I'm rolling keep saying dumb stuff please
---
Following to see what ppl say. Commented so I get notified. 
---
Do orbital strikes destroy CAMP objects? Because I would looove to watch that lol.
---
If you're playing solo I highly recommend getting all three levels of line wanderer perk... the buffs it gives makes living through some of the higher level quests and areas much more...livable. :)
---
I've been playing Co-Op with my brother. The few times I log in to play solo, I get bored. Without NPCs or anyone to talk to, the game is just picking up junk and shooting enemies.
---
I'm not sure why Bethesda chose to remove NPCs altogether, but it would be nice to have some back.
---
Probably but if they could get that crap fixed it’d be fun
---
It is highly debatable that dupers are a large portion of the fan base. 
---
It is more likely dupers are a large portion of a gold mill in a North Korean warehouse. Duping items to exchange for real world money is extremely problematic on a huge number of fronts. "It is just a video game" is a horseshit justification. 
---
It is an act that negatively affects the larger player base. It disrupts the game economy and introduces server instability. it is not a harmless act. It isn't an innocent "oh, just gamers doing what they do, whatever..." thing. 
---
How?
---
Yeah I think I'm about to quit this game. Oh well at least they didn't get me to spend any more than the initial full release price. If they want me to grind away on a never ending treadmill for 99% trash legendary RNG then I'll find something better to do. I have a bunch of games with an actual story to play anyway.
---
So do I, though I'm starting to think about adjusting my build to be PVP capable. Currently workshops are impossible for me if I can fight back maybe it will add a dimension to the game.
---
Well hey, more free time for you to play FO76 now amIright or amIright?
---
Build a water pump at your camp and spam collect for 10 or 20 minutes and make it all into boiled water.
---
Falloutbuilds.com as well
---
hunters rifle and pump action shotty are both pretty damn good for a long time.
---
pump action in particular is only slightly worse than the combat shotgun for most things, the only thing that really blows is reloading.
---
I quit picking through her inventory. I do a take all. But I've never had the infinite load on her corpse either. 
---
Did you do enough damage to tag her as your loot?
---
I’ll buy one, but I won’t be on for a couple hours. IGN: EpicZephos 
---
Same. I knew I'd get it eventually but I had other games to finish when it released and knew that they'd be issues at launch because Bethesda... So I held off and picked it up half price a couple of weeks ago. The crashes on PS4 still frustrate me though.
---
You mean super mutants with comprehensive and well-thought out dialogue?
---
I found one for a ridiculous price, appreciate the offer though!
---
I checked the transfer menu. Nothing is there. Im not removing the water because the purifiers are not full, none of them
---
You mean like how dupers are being punished by being banned from the game? They’re still cheaters, in breach of the ToS.
---
U r rite!
---
Ah okay
---
My understanding is this.  For example, if you mouse over a workshop, it tells you how much water it produces.  That's it's max water/hour i believe.  If you build 20 purifiers, combined they can only hit that value.  I think your CAMP has a hidden value for water similar to a workshop.  So if your camp is say 5/hour, and you setup 1000 water purifiers, only 5 of those will get 1 water per hour.
---
I think it's to prevent people from printing caps since they sell to vendors.  This is what people did in fo4.
---
You can get much better sell prices for ballistic fiber in the trade reddits.
---
Go to FO76 Market or FO76 Bazzar and sell it there for at least 5 caps each.
---
I'm almost to the point where I need more.  That's where I'll be getting it from...lol
---
Perk called starched genes in luck, rank it up to level 2 and you never lose mutations when you take radaway.
---
If you are having to go grind components on any regular basis, it's because you are doing something wrong.  Either you aren't taking the right perks for your playstyle (like White Knight if your armor keeps breaking) or you aren't grabbing the junk you need as you play.
---
Don't blame Bethesda and make up conspiracy theories about them forcing you to play more because you're unwilling or unable to address your problems with the tools you have available to you.
---
Lol they did also reduce repair costs by up to 20% so it's not all bad
---
Yeah, as others have said, it seems pretty uncommon. And sometimes it doesn't say you have one in your effects menu. 
---
I spent a good while debugging this with a friend a few weeks ago, he had an alcohol one, and couldn't share perks. He couldn't figure out why, but eventually I told him to try an addictol just to be safe and sure enough, that was it.
---
I don't even have an adhesive farm, I use heavy guns that break constantly, and I have so much adhesive I have to bulk and sell it sometimes.
---
I believe it's anglers? Some creature drops loads.
---
Sorry lol. I'm lvl 6 so I'm wondering, too. 
---
in my travels i’ve encountered some camps that look like huge palaces, with all the goodies and decorations inside, and i’m like WTF?!
---
"Nah, you gave me Salisbury Steak." 
---
Cold case so fantastic, I started it on my first day in the BETA (last day it ran / session was when I finally had the download and had my windows 7 playing nice with it), and I just decided to complete it yesterday. Feels, the feels! Motherlode I did in my first week ish of the full launch and the first quest I did after having gained marsupial as my first mutation. fondest memory. I am currently progressing thru key to the past gradually Whilst in search of the side quests and secret secondary areas. Of which there are hundreds, literally. this is the way games used to be enjoyed, with tons of detail and narrative woven into the environment.
---
People have gotten them
---
Ha ha!
---
How is an adhesive farm grinding?
---
Spend 5 minutes making one, have adhesive forever for next to no effort...
---
100 cores , holy sh4t , what is reward ? 100000 caps ? 
---
Karma farming that way —&gt; r/Fallout
---
Tho, even that subreddit seems to tire a bit of posts like these.
---
Yeah totally, it was so refreshing to meet mutants like Marcus and Neil when I originally played NV when I was 12, so I would probably appreciate it if I could meet one that wasn't completely a green caveman
---
Small booms, big booms, I got em all
---
Still waiting for the plans already acquired before I buy plans. Is this in the works??!!
---
I know.
---
I like the analogy, pretty much how it has been for me trying to take workshops. The number of times I've been 1 shot by someone claiming the workshop with some explosive gun thingy :/
---
This reply doesn't make any sense
---
Somehow I found a TSE shotgun at lvl. 32, and waited till I was 35 to use it. I use that gun at every combat encounter, but I do hate how overpowered it is. Removing them would definitely make PvP more interesting and PvE more intense.
---
Things like buying flood insurance.
---
I spent a good deal of time defending Fallout 76 and 100% agree. I think the core game is great but it needs some more interesting end game content. They need dungeons and bosses that require strategy and some quests for end game gear to outclass the dupers. 
---
There’s no gun in the game called the brotherhood rifle so idk what’s up with this guy. 
---
Yes, very well. Tried it yesterday on a golf course camp.
---
Yeah nobody ever buys them I will try to keep you in mind
---
Now I know this is a controversial opinion in the sub themed around this game! But I dont think the game this sub is centered around is that bad!
---
Upvotes to the left for my brave gamer opinion!
---
I mean we still buy it... 
---
The armor on the game really gives me the itch for badass armor and clothing mods. I thought Bethesda employed some Nexus modders to create stuff
---
I actually use both, a long pump to deal with miners and stuff and a hardened hunting rifle for longer range things. On top of that, I found a combat shotgun in Grafton that I’m waiting for level 20 to use.
---
You clearly never worked in SW dev and never seen a QA team do their work. 
---
Just because a product ships early (which is the current standing **right** way of shipping as taught in any business school since about 2011) doesn’t mean they don’t have a QA team. 
---
Get off your soapbox, Batman. We need the plastic. 
---
I'll test this ASAP, I got a couple level ups to knock down to get my class freak.
---
That's really awesome
---
Ad Victoriam 
---
Bethesda shill. They released a broken/unfinished game for full price and only started to fix it when it effected their profits. This game was a rushed cash grab they deserve all the shit they got. 
---
Accessories might be coming. Rumor has it we are getting backpacks soon.
---
PVE SERVERS  
---
Thats how you fix this without complainers.  
---
Anything else is half-assing it.
---
yeah no problem dude
---
Just saw your edit, your right and yes neither do I, I was say this post unfairly classifieds everyone into the category of the tool that I mention above, I could have worded it better
---
99 power cores!
---
First trump now this. Smh
---
According to [this person](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a6edav/how_water_purifiers_currently_work_via_my_testing/), multiple water purifiers of the same type share the same production cycle, so adding more purifiers only increases your capacity, not the speed at which you produce water.
---
I suggest experimenting with fewer water purifiers. I run only 3 regular water purifiers in my CAMP, and they each have 3 purified waters in them every time I return to my base. I frequently have a surplus.
---
If you need some background noise while your out scavenging, I would highly reccomend Forgotten Weapons episode on gold damascene!
---
https://youtu.be/4KM7ySNWuqU
---
Same.
---
I can see how that would suck.  If you play through the main plot again keep an eye out for picture frames when you're looking around - a lot of the faction locations have photographs of the characters whose voice recordings we hear throughout the game.  I know for certain that the original Rose has a photograph in the same building as the DMV - but I can't remember where the others are.
---
This is how workshops play in the game. It’s a potential PVP zone. 
---
Same here. I'm like, wtf is this dude whining about? Now, the protest march... That could be moved back a bit.
---
Do you have armoror 4? I need that to apply my Dense mod. That I can finally do today.
---
Fair enough.
---
Thank you for your super controversial brave le gamer opinion!
---
Everything already dies in one hit.  Instigating is not worth it because of that fact. 
---
Killed my first at level 30. All alone and she jumped me. Killed her minders and after about 15 minutes killed her with a Bayonet. Broke my sledge on her head. ;)
---

---
nice khadgar reference xd 
---
This is the dumbest thing I’ve read here today. 
---
Correction Egg head is an RP mutation for builds that want to have the lowest combat based stats on principle.
---
I got mine off of a super mutant in grafton. It’s definitely an oddity. I wish you could scrap it to gain the ability to paint other mini guns with it, but somebody said they scrapped one and didn’t get anything.
---
The best kind of reward: recognition and titles
---
isnt having a "jack of all trades build" about having no speciality like shotguns and using everything? not hating have played a jack of all trades build in f4 once thats why im a bit confused.
---
This reply doesn't surprise me.
---
This. It's like having a group member slack off for the entire project; and once we get reamed they start working on it and fixing it. 
---
Fwiw both only effect base. Meaning damage from mods or over-repair aren't factored in. Two-shot adds a unmodified not over repaired bullet and furious (probably) adds 10% of base damage up to a cap. 
---
good point, but you think people should be able to take others thing without the fear or repercussion from the player you took it from? On all servers
---
Not true. A guy gave me one as soon as I stepped out of the vault. Served me well through lvl 15 or so. 
---
I'm addicted to this game, does that count? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I have been once, I think... at least my Pip Boy status icon showed him eyes closed and tongue out so I think it was an addiction?
---
From what I've heard/read, addictions in this game only have a small downside (usually -1 to SPECIAL), and go away after a while, so it's not dangerous nor really game breaking if you think about it. That might change in the future though
---
Pc platform, the other day after the patch I wasn’t doing really anything. Today I crashed a hand full of times too. This time I was trying to get nuclear waste for a mount Blair quest. Went over to kanawha nuka plant and noticed after two reboots. The others were when I was crafting for a quest.
---
Doesn't explain, literally all of their other 3D games though. 
---
Very true. I guess I'll be doing some "spring" cleaning soon. Thanks. 
---
Peepee
---
Nothing will ever be good enough for these sad fuckers who pre-ordered a Bethesda game, were surprised that shipped with a boatload of issues, and then had to watch the people who wisely waited until it was released and picked it up for half price. It's a deadly combination of entitlement, naive idealism, and buyer's remorse. Notice all the violent analogies of Bethesda physically injuring people by releasing a video game? 
---
Good luck! I'm going to try experimenting some more with a high rad resistance build and see if that has any kind of positive effect. 
---
No need to store that. It's what computed properties are for
---
I would love something like this. The only limiting factor would be the amount of lag produced by that many enemies/corpses. The bodies would have to disappear right away and reward the player with items after the event or something along those lines.
---
This is the mostly correct answer. Each kind of water purifier has that fixed rate of production no matter how many of that kind you build. Building more just increases your storage space for the water produced by that kind of purifier. If you want to make water more quickly, you would build one of each different kind of water purifier, not multiples of the same. Interesting note: The clean purifier in the Atom Shop actually counts as a different kind of purifier in these calculations.
---
I wonder if someone figured out how to port over the survival console mod from 4 to 76.
---
If I put my belongings on my driveway and they get stolen, it's partially my fault (like it is partially Bethesdas fault that the exploits weren't patched) because I made it easy.
---
That isn't a crime though. I am legally allowed to put my own property on my driveway and leave it there unattended. It *is*, however, a crime to come along and steal those belongings without my consent, regardless of whether it was careless or not for me to leave them there.
---
In this case, Bethesda made it "easy" to exploit, but knowingly exploiting it for personal gain is the crime in this case.
---
Unlocked car with keys in ignition? Easy to steal. Was it ok to steal it because you could? No.
---
While I agree that Bethesda should have fixed it long ago, they didn't (not a "crime") Assuming there is a clause in the TOS (i'm sure there is like just about every online game) about cheating and exploiting bugs, the exploiters were clearly in the wrong. There's no valid argument to be made against that fact.
---
I had to really hold myself to not laugh at that part lol.
---
That guy was just a joy. He really got into the whole thing (sitting down, making questions, hearing my lore dump, etc). I almost did not kill him, but Mothman must have his sacrifices.
---
Ironically enough the only one worth considering doing this for is the very first quest reward weapon you get, from the first leg of the main quest Morgantown airport. (Anti armor .44 pistol)
---
Grahm is the best. I was sneaking my way through Big Bend Tunnel when i suddenly hear him talking about trades to Chally.
---
I immediately stopped sneaking and just casually walked behind him for the rest of the trip through the tunnel, as he murdered everything that even laid eyes on him. 
---
Wow what the heck.  So in order to know for sure if you have one or not, you have to manually calculate what your stats should be and see if there's a discrepancy?  Since I have a handful of addictol on me should I just take one and see if I get a "you're no longer addicted" message?
---
Well this is one of the most glitchy and underdone games I’ve ever played. You really cant blame anyone for being upset. Cant even play for 1 hour straight without a server disconnect.. 
---
I found the link to his interview.:

So are you 3 seeking a 3rd, or 3 seeking a 4th. Your post is confusing. 
---
*Press to pick up candy bucket in wotoga high*
---
Game: you wanna sit down in front of these 4 ghouls.
---
Me: no no no noooooo
---
He’s just stnding there...
---
..MENACINGLY!!
---
No, I described how gmail operated for the first 5 years. The way it’s taught is you **love** in beta and don’t even need to call it a beta. 
---
“Early access” still carries an expectation of polish on release day. It’s still an old world concept. New world says as follows; 
---
*data* shows consumers will forgive many things (we *are* playing fallout 76, right?)
---
*data* shows access to user feedback easly results in fundamentally better subsequent design decisions. Hence, the current dogma taught in business schools Is ship early and catch up fixing bugs. There’s an adage - “if you’re comfortable shipping, you’ve waited too long”. 
---
I'd still have preferred they just make a FO5
---
How is it a disadvantage, but why should you be able to steal another players loot without consequence's ? Still waiting for you explanation of how I am a bully btw
---
I haven’t
---
You punks just stay outta mah junkyard. *Sits back down atop trailer...*
---
How did you learn that power armor makes your base 11? I have been trying to figure this.
---
Should they not be trying after that massive cluster fuck? 
---
They sure as hell better be putting 200% effort into fixing things and making people happy again after that shit storm they created. 
---
So yeah, good for them for cleaning up their mess and trying to make people happy after pissing off a giant portion of the Fallout community. 
---
They don't deserve credit for doing the job they should have done to begin with. 
---
"Thanks for what you should have been doing 3 months ago." 
---
I've had him help me fight a Scorchbeast once when I was in my 20's. Felt like I had my own wingman in that fight
---
😍⚓🙌
---
Ouch.  
---
I'm not experiencing that but then again the patch did come out yesterday. Hopefully, the issue is easily fixable. 
---
Nope. Many posts.
---
M_Young901. I’ll be on Tuesday for a while! Definitely trying to team up to grind legendaries and play harder content 
---
A better method would be how programmers that find an exploit in some software go about it usually.  They send the information to the company so it can be fixed and then in X days from that (not sure what the X usually is) they release the information to the general public.  This way the company knows about the issue and can get it fixed prior to information being released en mass.
---
Very well done, thank you for sharing
---
That's doable client-side, quite easily. No need for any metadata; it's what computed properties are for
---
You realise that if you expect better, and spend your money better, it will force them to produce decent games right from the get go. Its annoying to see people more than happy to accept a sub standard product and hail it as a more than worthy sell.
---
Won’t be on till about 6:30 EST
---
Does that craft bag still require a monthly subscription? Haven't played ESO in a while.
---
Okay but thing is people still bought it and love it. Yes they probably didn’t try as hard as they could but they’re still trying. But this game was getting shit before it even dropped. 
---
That’s an amazing metaphor
---
Haaaaaaaa +infinity
---
Well I know that. I don't mind genuine PvP and do it myself if I want a workshop.
---
This guy followed me around for about 25 minutes, slashing at me with a tiny knife, and I refused to engage making that clear with the 'No' emote. 15 of those minutes were him slashing at me at my fully tricked out workshop. At the end of those 25 minutes he started to claim the workshop, forcing me into PvP.
---
Does that sound like someone who wanted the workshop, or a griefer?
---
No shit its not perfect and needs to be fixed. We fo76 fans admit to that every damn day. I meant thousands of *different* items. Dont know about you but my game freezes up or even crashes when i have almost traded with dupers. Fucked off from them as soon as i see their inventory having 8000 of each weapon, armor, junk, laced drug and bobblehead. You must have the strongest gaming pc or something because im only on console and get booted just being near some piece of shit duper.
---
It's so simple guys, just run a corporate businesses flawlessly and provide a perfect game for the consumer. Duh 
---
Your sauce is always here: https://nukacrypt.com/solved
---
Bethesda needs to permaban dupers if they have the evidence. These people keep finding ways to do it And it ruins the whole trade and market feature of the game 
---
Yea, it just simply tells me I lack the required materials.  I’m one over in the flux, about 85 over on the nuclear material, and 2 over on the ballistic fiber.  Other than armorer any other things that might trigger it?
---
Its kind of funny how your comment chain of "not here, not now" could be replicated by downvotes. Because that's what theyre for.
---
Conversly, I jumped on last night to try out the changes, got server dc'd three times in ten minutes and feel perfectly fine saying that Bethesda STILL sucks dinky dong.
---
Eh, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
---
Even listening to every holotape and taking your time with the lore, I just find myself wishing they had just made FO5. 
---
Despite what people claim, the story is very lackluster and missing what makes a fallout game a fallout game.
---
Lmao. Why would he need to calm down? You seem completely unaware of what's going on here
---
Somerset special from Final Departure
---
Supply missions for your members might be good.
---
Collect X radaways, stims / super stims, ultracite scraps, flux
---
other fun ideas:
---
* bring a rare mob (deathclaw, megasloth, etc) to commanders camp so it can be tamed
---
* ... this is harder than I thought
---
Dude I played Fallout 4 for wayyy too long haha. Though I admit I didn't enjoy melee in that game (nor was it required). In 76 I happened to find a Tier 3 legendary pitchfork and a flaming mod within minutes of each other, so as it turns out that weapon is my best one, and I have to use it pretty often against any mob with high ballistic defense. This is what's leading me to get increasingly frustrated with the fail of the Alt key design, haha.
---
scorch scorch scorch
---
What's the term for when you read the same word so much that it loses meaning?  :)
---
It is sad to see people downvoting it. It doesn't matter what armor you're using, the shotguns and other explosive legends are out of control and plain and simple EVERYWHERE due to dupers. Thus they're being abused to all hell. Can hardly take a single shot from that sheet, and that's if you're lucky. You're more likely to just die in one hit.  
---
Nerf it, nerf it, nerf it. I could care less if you can't one-shot a scorchbeast anymore, the damage seriously needs a capping. Wearing Power Armor feels utterly pointless cause it won't protect you from this shit to begin with.
---
Ban/Rollback anyone using Duped equipment. Remove all the duped equipment for that matter, including the original. But I'd seriously ban the youtubers spreading this shit like a virus.
---
Oh. No hard feelings here. Just saying why some of us run with it on. It's a very abusable mechanic. Especially with workshops when you're on a team. I won't even try to pvp at monster mash. It just isn't fair. I one shot people with my powerfist. Vats will teleport me 15-20 feet to catch a hit.
---
Dupers can't dupe but that won't stop them from trying to dupe what can't be duped. As in, they ay not be able to dupe but that doesn't mean they still can't cause server instability by trying to.
---
Dupe.
---
You actually did tell him to calm down tho. He told you to calm down and gain self awareness. You then told him to follow his own advice. Sounds like you need to calm down and gain self awareness in my opinion as well.
---
Don't go chasing waterfalls...  
---
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.  
---
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all....  
---
But I think you're moving too fast.
---
He had cool dialog but the *one* time I've actually found him I couldn't have been more dissatisfied with the loot he was selling at the time. Literally nothing good to buy at the time.
---
Gun control statistics prove gun ownership is not a problem. Suicide is. Let's argue. 
---
Ok, these are the results of this test
---
1 Hour test
---
4 industrial purifiers: Produced 2 purified water in total.
---
20 purifiers: Produced 6 purified water in total. Not a single purifier reached its storage limit.
---
13 small purifiers: Produced 4 purified water in total. Not a single one reached its storage limit.
---
I checked the transfer menu.
---
This is 12/hour, with 37 purifiers combined, running at the same time.
---
It costs 224 in energy, 18.7 of energy per purified water.
---
I can totally say that having a lot of purifiers is not worth it at all. 
---
That’s one hell of a rifle, 84 caps though
---
Yeah with the pump i’ve gathered like 400 shells at level 14
---
See I think this is where most people are wrong. 
---
They didn't start fixing it after it impacted their wallet.
---
They started releasing patches in the first weeks after launch, as most games do now. It just so happened that the game was struggling. 
---
Are we to assume they would t have patched fixes in the first weeks had the game sold well? That's flawed logic right there.
---
Ah, good to know on a few fronts. I read that the junkpile extractor made springs, but not screws. Didn't realize that scissors and coffee pots had screws. Thanks!
---
&gt;corportation
---
corporation\*
---
I've not seen the town or any landmarks that would lead me to think that.  What do you remember about it being mentioned?
---
So you're saying they should wipe everyone's inventory?
---
The people that bugged their way into one of the expansion vaults saw nothing but corpses and a destroyed vault that hadn’t seen a living thing in 50 years 
---
Lol! So why live there? I mean I understand the cool but if you repair a lot?
---
If it’s “brotherhood recon...”then that’s the name of the scope. There is no weapon with word brotherhood in the game. 
---
Well that's good to know, thanks for the clarification!
---
It was a fake. It was the fallout 4 dev room with a mod that put fake plans in a container. The post for it was already taken down. 
---
Lol!!!
---
Exactly a modded 308 versus a standard 50 cal. If you took the standard 308 versus the standard 50 cal then 50 cal is stronger. You didn't read what he wrote properly.
---
Dear lord, I thought I was going crazy. I didn't realize that word you typed was.. /sigh
---
I even put it in our group chat at work.  "WHAT IS CLAVENYAY" /sigh.    Fortunately a fellow gamer goes "Fo76? You moron it's...&lt;this thing&gt;".  
---
Week's been too long. 45 minutes and I can just go play and relax...
---
Thats crazy, havent done monster mash yet, just picked up my first power fist in a drop and didnt know it did that. That is the point I was trying to make thou is that pacifier mode can and is used by a lot of people for the wrong reasons
---
i think you are greatly overestimating the amount of people who want to pvp sure some want it but most of bethesda's core audience that are playing or will play when they add more content dont want to pvp
---
As far as I've seen there has been 0 acknowledgement of this from their end.
---
I'm happy you're enjoying the game, but if this is really "the most immersive gaming experience" you've had, then I feel like you've missed out on a lot truly amazing games out there. Like I enjoy 76 too, but it's far from the best RPG ever made.
---
What if some of the people in a town weren’t logged on, wouldn’t it look like buildings are constantly appearing and reappearing 
---
Whoa
---
they owe me $180 for the three copies of this game I bought for me and my friends
---
We do it because its a feature in the game are playing.  Its part of the game. 
---
Its not greifing at all. Stop being lame and server hop like the bitch thay you are.
---
They aren't banning dupers. Do you know how many people they would have to ban? 
---
Right now Bethesda is only banning people who use third party software to rapids create items out of thin air. 
---
I have a mule account that stores 8 people items. Does that mean I dupe? No, I don't, I'm to lazy to rapidly press a button a million times. 
---
Do I know people who dupe? I sure do. 
---
Do I turn down free stuff that they give me?
---
 Hell no. 
---
As asked myself the same thing when I got it. I'm going to assume that it applies after being fired. Idk. Thanks Bethesda.
---
Nah it's the game.
---
hold up, I just checked, scissors and coffee pots don't have screws ... why the hell am I picking those up?
---
the hotplate underneath does for sure, and flip lighters
---
There’s a limit on Xbox as well. You’ll reach it. And it will sadden you. We need more photo space!
---
Yes and IIRC it clears all in one so no need to use more
---
Ive recently picked it up agin and after the 10ths patch it feels reealy good to play. Mist bugs have been squashed. Im greatly enjoying it. I just wish everyone didnt have OP duped items because I have none of those and am at an extreme disatvantage. Maybe a wipe would work? Idk
---
Then I guess the ones I've been crafting are figments of my imagination?
---
I preordered. I returned the game the next week. Now I am just watching this sub burn while I sit comfortably.
---
Yep, but a TSE level 45 handmade at a vendor was duped.
---
she will just transform into a fleshpile not disappearing completely.  
---
This happened for me a few times already, and i can guarantee her flesh pile is there, always.  
---
the map terrain is horribly for finding her fleshpile and it took me one time more than half an hour, but I always found it with perseverance and lots of searching. 
---
(always good to pickup any fleshpiles in the area until you find hers to remove them) 
---
They've acknowledged it [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aejq9b/patch_notes_10jan2019/edr2kyb)
---
Pvp is not greifing. You go play something else. We are playing this game as it was designed.
---
I always just RP'd it as them hitting your finger right on the nail and you going "Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuudge!" for the next 20 seconds while waving your hand around and sticking your finger in your mouth.
---
I still haven't seen the Brahmin pen in my workshop despite having learned the plans for it.
---
The 10mm pistol is a solid weapon with the right modifications. When I was grinding my two alt characters, I relied on Hardened 10mm pistols with a Perforating Magazine. You can comfortably kill any same-level mobs with it, 10mm ammo is really easy to find/craft in bulk, and they're extremely durable too.
---
Don’t forget that mole miners drop something that can be scrapped for black titanium 
---
Your concern is touching.
---
Fixed thanks
---
Thanks, I've picked my first blocker and Incisor must be unlocked at higher level I think
---
I believe you bro, but I didn't see any of her remains anywhere. I'll make sure to triple check next time it happens) 
---
Yes, unless they kill you.
---
It's called fertilizer stand or something. It looks like a wheel Barrow. It's actually a brahmen.
---
It’s just a hunting rifle with mods... that’s it. 
---
At the end of the game, when you have been seen and done everything ... park your main and start a new solo dead-is-dead run from vault 76 to launch a nuke at the lowest possible player level. 
---
Unassisted, no gifts or charity gimmies. Many challenging hours to be had with that one to demonstrate your mastery.
---
 It can be annoying I do agree, but I run a Bayonet on my Shotgun and my Tactical Hunting Rifle. I use 'nades all the time and spec explosive perks when I can.
---
 I can do that and seldom experience flailing at the air. Once in a while though. ;)
---
New issue for me since the patch....will check the official forums to see if it's been reported.
---
Zenimax
---
I gotta find and scrap some 10mm then
---
I haven't found any TSE so far and started thinking about chances. Warning: rough calculations and uniform distribution assumed.
---
* If there are about 100 weapon types and about 100 armor part types that can be dropped as legendaries. Chances to get a specific item, such as a legendary handmade type would be **1:200** or *0.5%* (or 20-30 Whitesprings runs). 
---
* Let's say a 3\* legendary enemy has a chance of 10% showing up. Since they are not guaranteed to drop 3\*, let's say there is only 20% chance they actually do. Thus finding any 3\* drop on a 3\* enemy has a chance of 10% x 20% -&gt; *2%* or **1:50**. 
---
* Finding any 3\* handmade thus has a chance of 0.5% x 2% -&gt; *0.01%* or **1:10,000**.
---
* If [there are](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a2n39c/this_spreadsheet_shows_which_legendary_effects/) 23 prefix effects (*4.35%* each) and 7 major effects (*14.29%* each), so having two shot explosive with any minor effect is 0.01% x 4.35% x 14.29% = *0.000621%* or about **1:1,600,000**.
---
If one would be fine with a specific prefix 1\* handmade (i.e., two shot), then
---
* 1\* legendary enemy has 60% chance to show up and 4.35% to get the prefix, that gives 0.5% x 60% x 4.35% = *0.013%* or **1:7,666**
---
* However, 2\* and 3\* enemies can drop 1\*. Let's say a 2\* enemy has a 30% chance of showing up and 80% chance of dropping a 1\*. That gives 0.5% x 30% x 80% x 4.35 = *0.0052%* or **1:19,111**
---
* Let's say a 3\* enemy has 60% chance of dropping a 1\* (and 10% showing up). That gives 0.5% x 10% x 60% x 4.35% = *0.0013%* or **1:76,666**.
---
* Total chance of getting a 1\* handmade with the desired prefix is thus 0.013% + 0.0052% + 0.0013% = *0.019%* or **1:5111**
---
Note that these are based on rough estimates and uniform chances. It is very likely certain legendary combinations are not permitted or certain combinations (more chance), such as TSE are deliberately nerfed. I also could have made a logical error when formulating these chances. [Here is the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_0dLcBvv-gKvbyNvIcbF1m8CYwGh6ktmcMxptH33_II/edit?usp=sharing) with the calculations.
---
Its not a bad game. Its buggy and flawed. I stand by my score of 6.8/10. By the first dlc i honestly expect it to be an 8/10. That said it needs to be a damned good dlc.
---
I see. Thanks!
---
I'm sure it wasn't intended to work like that, but it's worth pointing out that this makes the clean purifier the only thing in the shop that actually does have a non-cosmetic effect on the game (however trivial).
---
Good luck. Im built more for pvp and smashing player camps. I dont nuke zone that often. 
---
The real question is what is the point of displaying "80 per hour" on my industrial purifier, saying that it has a capacity of 3, but allowing it to hold 5 waters before it's full?
---
Literally none of that makes any sense nor is it explained anywhere.
---
I think playing on a PVP server should come with all of the punishments of playing on a PVP server, including junk loss and caps penalties.
---
I think having a halfassed pvp system sucks, but I dont think they should "turn off" rewards for it. 
---
I think that pacifist mode should mark you on the map, and your camp, but make them invulnerable to players.
---
I also think, like diablo hardcore mode, you should have to choose when creating the character if you're one way or the other.
---
The toggle feature is fucking them in ways they didnt plan on.
---
Yes lone wanderer is more suitable for me, I don't have time to schedule my playtime so solo it is
---
Quit being a fan boy and acting like all this was unexpected. The game shipped in a terrible state and they are doing what is expected of them. You would praise someone for cleaning up after taking a shit on the dinner table
---
I used to be able to place my hulking red rocket sign on teammates lawns.... after the patch atom shop items are no longer able to be placed on anybody elses account but your own. So there is that.
---
Yeah. I'd say atleast your waiting 2 weeks for a patch.
---
Ps4 player. Dismember enemies all the time. Even deathclaws
---
And the only video of him is someone killing him :(
---
[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/adzj24/two_youtubers_known_for_their_fo76_duplication/) had the earlier fake ([imgur link](https://imgur.com/a/Of3HeEW)). The wording in this [new email](https://i.redd.it/19peo5lunr921.jpg) is identical to the Elder Scrolls Online one, though they lost a paragraph break.
---
That doesn't prove the new email's fake, since it's all the same company and they no doubt reuse things, but it's a little odd.
---
I know ESO waits to do their bans in waves. They spot cheaters, but instead of acting right away, they put systems in place to catch the rest of them, and ban them all together without warning. Though it still frustrates players because the bans are infrequent enough that bot farmers make enough money to keep coming back.
---
Damn,i am on PC . Wish i could be with you guys
---
I believe the "Inside the Vault" post hinted at something like this ("the number of plans Vendors have available"), but I don't recall anything specific to it in this last patch.
---
Oh yeah, broke my two shot gatling lazer using 3 full cores with double duration perk card plus all the melee to her cheeks. definitely did damage) 
---
lucky man)
---
One major suggestion I have, don't rush, don't fast travel everywhere, enjoy the game,'read the notes, listen to the holotapes and you should find it very enjoyable 
---
Thanks for your vigilance my friend, I will take this to my players and submit it to the podcasts.
---
lucky! 
---
thats a great idea in itself, but not really a themed mission that im looking for. thanks :)
---
Industrial purifiers still never produce 80 water per hour. Stand in front of your purifier and look at a clock. Can you pull out 1 water every 45 seconds? Not even close.
---
AFAIK the industrial says 5 and is 5
---
It's not terrible, tbh, but it's CTDing me about every 40 minutes or so. Irritating, but that's prob 2 crashes in my usual play time. This is just tonight, mind, so don't take that as any kind of measurement.
---
I'll probably seriously rage about it on Sunday when I get to play more :P
---
so how much is bethseda paying you?
---
I would have to agree. Think about Destiny, initially the launch was a disaster and the games campaign was an absolute bust (it didn’t get much better but hang in there). Bungie leveraged OUR posts on reddit to build a better game and create a community around it. This game has potential to grow in a similar fashion as we are seeing already. There’s no way to get a growing MMO game right off the back. 
---
However, the B.E.T.A could’ve lasted a significantly longer and after true trial and error they could’ve released a full blown release in Q1 of this year. Let’s see what happens. 
---
If they could build this and display cases for bobbleheads and magazines, maybe even gun racks, that'd be epic!
---
Right now, they're trying to keep containers working properly within the databases, and more containers that travel with the players mean more columns to reference when loading the character. 
---
I'm not sure how the servers are managed, but displaying the hard-earned (or purchased) swag is a great sales tactic for the atomic store, which is why I'm surprised they have neglected the advertisement space. 
---
Whenever I need black Ti, I head to Welch and farm Mole Miners. 
---
flux would be a good one! we actually have a stim/radaway mission for knights, and ultracite scraps for paladins. 
---
yeah its rough isnt it haha
---
Awesome! I was checking that thread and didn't see that, thanks so much!
---
Yeah that could be a pain if you don’t want to leave the server because you already have workshops. Aside from that all you can do is fast travel and hope they don’t follow. I haven’t had an issue with trolls in the game so far but I know they are out there. 
---
Nope,my game was pretty stable before the update. Now it's a mess
---
Yep, I swear by the 10mm pistol so much that I even bought a Two-Shot one for my third character to use at level 50. 
---
I am a raider community
---
Hence the nerf.
---
Greifton Steel is :
---
**rah \* dick \* you \* luss**
---
With a group it can be fun in that, lose more steel than you can harvest kinda way...
---
Solo I've taken to the dirt track lately. One billion less super mutants, and a noticeable dearth of 12 year olds with duped TSE shotguns.
---
Yeah that duplication exploit was a big one but they even honed in on Bobby pin weights and lever gun reloads. Great work devs. 
---
Not that I haven't.  Just because thats always the answer, doesn't mean some of us haven't tried.
---
No...XB1
---
Have the same problem with CC on 4 sometimes I quit the game and renter or wait a while
---
People can still kill you if you have pacifist, having pacifist just doesnt let you dish out damage, but you still take
---
I agree that it's a really great game, but without npc's I can't say it's the most immersive game I've ever played. A decently modded skyrim is much more immersive than 76.
---
Playing a game where more than a handful of the player base actually want to pvp would be the first thing I’d try...
---
He spawns here. It's a bout a 1 in 50 chance, the Responder Vendor bot also spawns here, about the same percentage. I was planning on eventually making a post about all the Random Encounters that spawn there, some day I'll get to it. 
---

AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! 
---
Wish i could help you.  have you tried the FO76 Discord.  Usually we would be playing on PCs but mistakes were made.
---
The 600+ is on PC. 76 hours is on xbox. There isn't cross platform so I had to restart. 
---
Hey if you're PC I'll give you an Addictol no probs.
---
Just let me know :)
---
Yeah thats interesting.. probably stick with 3 industrial though.  I don't sit there waiting, i come back and grab a bunch and go.  
---
A trial, a quest, for your people to prove their worth ! 
---
But, yeah I get that.
---
oof
---
Bethesda is corporate btw, you wouldn't have share holders if it wasn't
---
HATER ALART!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
for fucking real the ending of the motherlode terrified me
---
Ah don’t worry I’m just waiting for a few weeks when they release their PvP game mode. I like to plan ahead.
---
Pacifist mode is for bitches! Fuck them. No fast travel for little girls who are pacifist!
---
YEEESSSSSSSS
---
It confirms Half Life 3
---
Yeah. It's really annoying. I still use, because I like how it shoots and I have tons of ammo, but it's infuriating.
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
Do you mind me asking what symptoms you are seeing?
---
I'm doing the same 1 hour test, but with only 3 purifiers.
---
1 industrial, 1 "normal" purifier and 1 small. 
---
Good lmao fuck these people. These guys have no defense against getting banned 
---
What the fuck is a TSE?
---
Yea but my problem is that any time I touch the alt key when I have a melee weapon equipped, it loads up a grenade. I effectively lose the ability to use my power attack. :(
---
Someone mentioned press vs. holding the key, but I don't see any distinction. As soon as I hold the key down to power attack I hear the grenade click noise. 
---
I did manage to find a 2 shot lever action someone sold to a vendor, but none of those have dropped for me either.
---
Found the Autist.
---
Never get the Speed Demon mutation and try to keep your Well Fed and Hydrated bonuses up.
---
Try verifying your game files.
---
Trashcan Carla was the first person I killed after leaving the vault... good times
---
Very good points, and someone made a good point in another comment that the only time you drop your loot is in a PVP event, because if someone is pacified then there is no repercussion for stealing other players items
---
I especially like the idea that it should be a choice at character creation and cannot be changed
---
It's all about the right perks for the weapon you're using. Best example for how abusable pacifist is. Go to a claimed workshop on a team. One person in pacifist. One person not. The person not in pacifist claims workshop, which initiates pvp for just him. Person in pacifist stands in circle contesting work shop and as long as he never fires back at the person trying to keep y'all from taking it, he can indefinitely contest the shop and is basically invulnerable to damage. Used to see this all the time when I claimed the ammo dump every day. 
---
Yep, I've been grabbing those. Also, I think (silver) watches have screws.
---
Suppose to drink beers first then whisky 
---
Will do!
---
You are correct. Unless you actively kill someone then you should not be able to loot their bag. 
---
Ultima Online did not have slap damage but Player Killers and Players had no advantage/disadvantage in combat. 
---
BUT there was a Karma system so a player knew hands down if someone was to be avoided because their name was in blood red font.
---
The PvP is broken - the paper-bag loot is broken due to the environmental aspect. I train a horde on you, you die ... I get no bounty but I get your bag.  This is broken. 
---
I kill you, get a bounty but my friend kills me and returns my caps. This is broken. 
---
Players who play as ‘Raiders’ and a—hats (Sorry Raiders no hate) should be flagged as such and only allowed to loot what they kill. 
---
Same for Bounty Hunter’s or whoever killing a Raider. 
---
No, I do not PvP but I do recognize the death mechanic and PvP are broken. 
---
I don't see it as bully so much as mouthy reprobate calling people who don't play the way you do juvenile names.
---
You get the quest completion exp every time you turn in technical documents to camp venture. You can find documents in the desks and file cabinets of the military wing of the enclave bunker. Only pick up and turn in one at a time.
---
Thanks, I've been so confused.
---
I like this explanation, thank you!! 
---
u/pugwan Im not going to argue with you. But even with the fixes, I gave up on this game. I divorce it. Ive spent years of my life on Fallout but this game is not what I fell in love with and it hurts. Time to get a real life.
---
Nobody goes into game design because they don't care about games.
---
its b8, m8.
---
I just buy games, I don't decide how it's supposed to work and I dont know how they work. Monsters can attack from underground, so what the hell for the other things.
---
Wouldn't wanna hang out with a bad dude like me yo. If you do you might one day find yourself occasionally letting your friends and family on your Spotify account or whatever; breaking all them ToS's as if they weren't the sacred rules we all strive to uphold. That's a dark, dark path with no way back mang.
---
Haven't read the entire thread, so someone else may have already mentioned this but I did find a level 1 dog, that's not an irradiated mess.
---

---
Found him in a camp with 2 dead ppl, wicked high up on a mountain. A trail leads all the way up and ends with him so I think he is supposed to be there.
---
I think its up to you to hotkey said items before a deathclaw encounter.
---
If youve got a gaming mouse you can bind 1 through 9 on custom settings for instant hotkeys.
---
Pacifist not being able to pick up loot bags? Sure, I guess. Being that you only drop junk I don’t see it as a big deal, personally. If you took a full inventory of screws and springs to a nuke zone, that’s kind of on you. 
---
I play in pacifist because, like other responses, pvp is broken. I also don’t take loot bags if the player is around, most of the time. One guy a few nights ago running through WS 1 shotting everything while myself and some others were already there trying to level eventually killed himself with explosive damage...I happily took all that junk,  but I digress. 
---
I think dedicated open pvp and pve servers are the answer, but some balancing needs to be done. Open pvp would just be a nightmare in the current state of the game. 
---
congrats on playing a fallout 4 clone that you paid extra for.
---
Install it - it should take 3 seconds.
---
*Artist, how did you come up with the idea that he was interested in the arts? 
---
Dang, I always took comfort in the fact that someone bigger and stronger and not afraid of PVP would come along later and take them out for annoying me. Now I'm dissatisfied! 
---
Yeah, they fucked up.  But there's always a guy at the top who is more concerned about the company going under than about releasing a perfect game.
---
You need both, honestly.
---
And plus there's practically no inventive to play unless you love hoarding weapons and killing muties for hours.
---
Just want to let you know that’s the dev test room from Fallout 4.
---
id imagine at least once or twice over the past few months has actually been a Bethesda employee or friend of one larping as a pleased customer, in a form of damage control 
---
Similar to the mental gymnastics regularly used to praise this game? Lol
---
All dlcs are free
---
Even if the devs care, management sees this as Extra development time cost &gt; lost revenue from releasing unfinished game.
---
Herbivore isn't that bad. Green thumb plus being able to eat plants as you go is a lot easier than spending ammo on mole rats
---
If you find it, you account gets banned within a few hours.
---
No one got their guns from that room... The guy that git in there is on PC and must have used mods. You can tell from just the UI there is at least one mod installed.
---
Me too, but that'll happen eventually. In like 8 years
---
Servers still crash on me at crucial points which I can't forgive. Can't blame the players. Anytime you leave an opportunity open for exploits, people are going to do it. Fast traveling takes forever sometimes and sometimes I can't even quit to desktop without the game freezing on me and having to re boot my PC. Combat system is still clunky as enemies sometimes don't even take damage at point blank range as they're rushing me. And why are melee builds so damn powerful??
---
I consider myself an artist, I dump all the tin cans I collect and make them into patterns in my camp.
---
You know, I have no idea why that phrase applies there but you say it with such conviction that I'm convinced it's absolutely the right thing to say.
---
articles on this feature the alleged e-mail sent by Bethesda, saying basically: "we know what you were doing, you cant do that, so you're suspended. if you tell us how you got there, then we will unsuspend you. until then, you're suspended indefinitely."
---
people have been allegedly getting away with the items, transferring them to a main, and have been selling them for real money; including unreleased items.
---
I'm sure it is...  
---
*head pats the autist, while wiping away some of it's drool*, while having no idea what it's blathering about.
---
I understand your opinion, but respectfully disagree. 
---
I loved my girlfriend, but when she lied and cheated on me I dumped her. No matter how much she tells me she's changed and how hard she's working on being better I have 0 regrets about ditching her.
---
If you dont mind building really high up, just south of monongah (or whatever) power plant, along the road there is a stupid tall cliff with a large ledge jutting out. It's directly above an acid hole, next to a power pylon. I never get attacked there.
---
Oxhorn made a video on every developer room in Fallout 4, and this was one, it’s the same exact layout and the only visible difference I noticed was the NPC.
---
What endgame ?
---
I’ve only had one. It’s not really a big deal. I’m just not a gamer. So when I notice something that OBVIOUSLY isnt working the way it should it’s bad. I even waved to the guy :,( 
---
Me and my girlfriend really aren't playing until the storage is increased by much more. I can struggle with it currently, but she picks up literally everything no matter what and there's no stopping her.
---
Congrats man! Do you want a prize or something? 
---
Got one to Psycho last night farming legendary ghouls in Whitespring.  
---
Beautiful
---
Note the X-01 prototype paint and the ultracite power armor. 
---
Sure.
---
&lt;insert evil laugh&gt; 
---
I have some steam built up from this week over crap at work (seriously, thank the heavens I work from home so the office doesn't hear the expletives)... So it's decided.
---
Tonight, after my daughter successfully spends most of my paycheck on cosplay material, comic books, and a smoothie blender), I'm going to grab a bottle of 18 year scotch as a celebration (divorce papers officially sent), and server hop, throwing the grenades at turret-camps...
---
Yep, with a few mods to put fake items in the containers to make it more convincing. 
---
no not really i enjoy this game as much as anyone else. but to say this game is perfect.far from it lag during SBQ,bodies dissapearing ect. but to each there own
---
Wrong. 
---
Bethesda is an LLC which is owned by a Corporation. Bethesda is not a Corporation.
---
I’m down although due to work I can only play til like midnight on weeknights 
---
Lets make fallout irl
---
They have been present in every Fallout game at least since 3 in some form.
---
From what I understand, they are useful for QA to test various weapons/armor/etc. without necessarily having to go find all those items in the game. In the single player games, they were also useful for people who make mods to test things. 
---
This setup allows QA to use the same sorts of techniques that players would be able to do in order to test things, versus spawning in items or testing them with code or console commands. I would argue that it's also preferable to using codes/console commands (not sure if they exist in 76, but I doubt it) because you don't want players in a multiplayer game having access to those.
---
I'm not sure why the dev room is able to be accessed by players in the multiplayer game, though I'm sure it wasn't intentional.
---
I don't work for a games company but I have dabbled in the field. 
---
Instigating, + power attack legendary.
---
This! I’ve got a great setup with a small indoor farm. I use green thumb and harvest 2 mutfruit plants, 2 Tato plants, and 1 each of razor grain, carrot, gourd, and corn. I can make two sweet Tato stews (health regen!) and 2 of each of the other soups.
---
This is easily enough to keep my hunger and thirst taken care of for a 2-3 hour session, plus adding the health regen from the stew.
---
Worth pointing out that soups decay in stacks, so it’s better to have a bunch of different kinds instead of 8 corns (for example.) This way if you’re still playing and need to make more, you can make more of what you already finished and the spoil counter will start over for them. 
---
I was about to do one. I can help you 
---
&gt;Players who play as ‘Raiders’ and a—hats (Sorry Raiders no hate) should be flagged as such and only allowed to loot what they kill.  
---
&gt;Same for Bounty Hunter’s or whoever killing a Raider.
---
Agreed
---
They're obligated to fix it. This is what they're doing. I agree now, I don't feel it was a 60 game initially I don't feel I wanted my money. And I'm not a loebie by any means (96)
---
What a Gad Dam good article!
---
Saw the opposite of this post, gave them a downvote. Have an upvote sir.
---
Of just turn off grafton mayor and Sanjay. No one likes them. 
---
Didnt they nerf the damage you take thou?
---
On PC I finished a Bot Stop quest I was looking through the loot and noticed I had Western Outfit and Chaps. I had never seen it before. I am not even 100% I got it from the quest. I definitely didn't loot it. So weird.
---
Yes, the bobblehead stacking is what bothers me the most. If they fix that, I would be thankful. 
---
Yes the game is fucked in many ways but if you're level 8 you have alot to do in the game and yes finding ammo becomes easier the higher level you become, because winning fights solo becomes easier. There is also a perk that allows you to find more ammo in general which helps 
---
also for reference it only takes 4 hours of holding all 3 power plants now that they rebuffed fusion core generation.
---
The lvl 35 player did not die to the other player, but rather succumbed to the environment.  The penalty for death, whether PVE or PVP, is your junk items drop in a paper bag for anyone to grab.  Just your junk items.  You don't lose your weapons, armor, meds, misc items, plans, or caps.  
---
It's a pretty minor inconvenience for dying.  
---
BUT, let's say that we want to give PVE players a chance to get their stuff back if they die.  
---
Put a two-minute timer on the bag (Pacifist mode only).  Nobody can loot it for two minutes.  After that, it's up for grabs.  
---
PVP, you can take their stuff on the spot.  
---
Killing a PVE player with slap damage (no PVP engagement) should be impossible,
---
Workshops remain the same - automatic switch to PVP when claiming.
---
Not necessarily... all of those games are shooters.  While Fallout is a RPG shooter, it’s audience does overlap to some extent as the aforementioned games. 
---
It has been a while since it's been tested, but I'd be willing to bet it still checks out. Please let me know either way!
---
You are not wrong actually, after looking into it. I admire they haven't went corporate. Either way management of any kind isn't easy as some people make it out to be.   
---
The combat knife is pretty hot.  Durable, respectable dmg and the faster attack speed makes it easier to time your attacks when you're running around.  And they gave the combat knife and the bowie knife a cool new animation when you draw them.  I'm lvl 27 now with a melee/rifleman build, and a serrated combat knife is the only melee weapon I carry. 
---
I'm gay
---
Munitions factory is great, we always have long fights that mostly end up with everyone becoming friends afterwards. My first time there, we killed a guy that dropped 540 molded plastic.  needless to say he didn't become friends with us, but we went back every night for a week.
---
Are you actually saying that TSE damage is balanced in the current game state?
---
To answer your question, no, weapons should not break that quickly. It's well documented that energy weapon durability is too low. I do feel that the unparalleled power of TSE weapons should come at a cost. 
---
In a single player game, it would be fine, but multiplayer balance needs to be more nuanced.
---
I’m level 55 with a few legendaries looking to take on the queen, I pretty much did everything else at this point. What console are you?
---
When nuked it has a high legendary spawn rate who are at a high level.
---
Meh, they could easily write a backstory for him. And, why? Well some people want a human NPC. I am not one of those. My reason? His name is Wooby and he's a mystery.
---
Well said, that would work
---
I'd check to see if you have anything stored from your previous build. Also, make sure you place turrets and traps last as they eat up a lot of your camp size.
---
I am attempting to save up gears, springs, and screws for the Excavator Set now.  I just reached level 26 and was working on the "Top of the World" main story quests with a couple of my friends.
---
I've also been hanging out at the Gorge Scrapyard mining up that Black Titanium (which, given how easy that workshop is, seems the gears, springs, and screws are going to be my bottle neck currently).
---
This weekend I think we are going to go start/complete the quest lines for the Excavator power armor plans.  I really want that set, +carry weight obviously.  But also the Power Armor station for my camp.
---
&gt;So what's your story? Looking to trade, rob me, or just ask directions to Diamond City? 
---
For sure! Great work and thank you, again, for bringing us that. I regularly use automelees now. :)
---
Can any machine give you the pie with enough tries or is there a randomly picked machine in the world that will give you it?
---
OMG they killed Wooby. You bastards.
---
Explosive? *frowns* 
---
That’s some junk nowadays.
---
Did you try turning it on and off again?
---
You are thanking them for... doing exactly what you paid them for?... You DO realize that they wouldn’t need to be “actually trying to make the game better” if they didn’t release it in such a sorry state right... they are just fixing their own screw ups. The fact you think this is worthy of praise is beyond me...
---
You may have to server hop. Recipe also spawns there. There are also two cases only accessible if you fall through the floor (think from 3rd floor to 2nd)
---
Xp legendary and flux farming. 
---
I just want better exp rates. Since you cant equip all the perks like you could in past games at least make leveling more bearable when you dont have a fucking full squad of savages ready to obliterate everything for you. The leveling grind is too harsh now. 
---
Tbh the only reason I break more than one is cuz I just tend to not wanna waste time. I'm not the sort of person to spend more than 30 seconds lockpicking. I usually spend one lockpick just finding the rough location of the sweet spot then either one or two more to actually unlock. Its how I've done it in every BGS game before and its how I'll do it in every BGS game after.
---
I thought that was the end of the month update that was getting that one.
---
Done all myself and worked
---
No turrerns nor traps. And nothing stored...i destroyed all the stuff i had left over..
---
Someone hacked their way into the dev room for the game and they found a human NPC named Wooby
---
.. And promptly killed him.
---
Is it really griefing? How else would raiders raid? Dont get me wrong i hate raiders
---
Yea that definately needs to be fixed
---
People want to be addicted for weapon effects in real life? I think they have other issues at that point...
---
Yeah, I left it in rice overnight too. Nothing
---
ya, i've been having more disconnects especially this morning.    
---
When do you expect the game to be ready for it to come out of beta? 
---
Oh you sweet, summer child.  It’s as if you’ve never played a Bethesda game.
---
 The entire hot key system is pretty bad. Its better than that stupid wheel though.
---
Add me pinkrockz sounds fun
---
Gotcha. 
---
I don't bother other players or smash up people's CAMPs, but I understand why people do it now that I'm at the end game.  There's only 1 way to have "sanctioned" PvP in the game and that's the Monster Mash event.  Yet you can only play the event once and odds are no one's going to show up in time to play with you.  I actually made a post about it yesterday.  But if the game doesn't give you an opportunity to find and enjoy PvP with other players who also want to play PvP, you're going to end up getting bored and trying to PvP those that don't.
---
Mine are bugged the same way, they triggered once, never seen them pop up again.
---
Yeah, I sell most of my chems.  That said, collecting all the straightjackets from Fort Defiance is a more efficient source of caps if you're seriously farming.  ~54 caps each with Charisma 4 and Hard Bargain 3.
---
I made this catalog so that other players can avoid wasting caps on known plans.  I'm still working on the Floor Decor tab, and there are a couple items I haven't been able to confirm, but I hope it helps!

This right here
---
I played with some guys and saw they had some extreme legendaries. I'm just going to play and base my weapon pool on what's good for me at this moment. Ill be getting rid of my explosive weapons though. I just need to get me a good legendary rifle.
---
Of course Bethesda is actually trying, they are a for profit business, and it's in their best interest to do so.  I think what most people are upset at is what they tried to pass off as a ready for market game.  Throw on top of the bait a swith of the canvas bag, and the bootle of rum in a plastic shell.
---
I'm not thanking them for cleaning up their own shit though.  They shoule have done it right from the beggining. 
---
Love them or not, they released multiple products (keyword multiple) that didn't meet the expectations.  Which they should be called out for.  After all, if people didn't call them out.  What they did might become the norm.  Don't get me wrong, I love my Fallout games and am awaiting Fallout 5.  I never thought I'd get into 76, because I've just never been into MMO games.
---
Thank you sir.
---
It is a silly place. Every time another player shows up for a look around, they spawn every single mutant back in. Pretty solid source of gunpowder to compliment your lead and steel, though.
---
Also, yeah it's a shame TSE is so ludicrous, because I love the odd bit of random PvP otherwise.
---
Thanks for checking it out!
---
Nope, still the same slap damage mechanic, nothing changes
---
Thats the only point I was trying to make with my over the top mouthy post, many good ideas here that could fix a lot of things, wish Bethesda would read these post
---
Xbox one actually.  I can only speak to what I have seen but i think a lot of this is like I said the target of the month and when the dupers are gone and the servers and game still runs like shit people will find something else to pin it on.   I love this game so I'm not bashing it I just think people need to recognize the game itself is the cause of most of their issues not some boogie man.
---
Yeah I mean I know its part of the game and what not. But some are worse then others.
---
Creek, dude
---
I’ve seen that! I don’t really know what it is, cause it definitely doesn’t give you it, like I once saw “Lead” but didn’t get lead from an assault rifle. Right now I’m assuming it’s a display bug.
---
As to your first question, yes it only increases the amount of basic materials you get.
---
You are very observant, have a cookie
---
That is what happened, but I couldn't be bothered to more emphasis on the "self-awareness" aspect. Thank you for the pedantic correction. I shall mend my ways right after I regain my vision from all this rage blindness.
---
You're the one spouting the vitriol buddy.  I would say threatening someone with a wood chipper is way more severe than telling someone to calm down. 
---
Again, gain some self awareness and chill, not everyone who disagrees with you is foaming at the mouth.
---
I didn't see any legendary weapons.. did i miss it or is this some clickbait 
---
Not gonna happen. They have literal Challenge dailies where you go out of your way to scrap smoking products.
---
Bethesda anti-nicotine confirmed.
---
Only other people can see if you're addicted. Just like real life. Then they stage interThen they stage interventions and get Junkie's Baton as a quest reward.
---
I ran into the same problem. I found that my last base was turned into a blueprint. Check your stored tab for blueprints as these will count against your build limit. There was an option to convert blueprint to individual items and then I scrapped each item I did not want .  You might be able to scrap the whole blueprint as well....
---
Nah man, I sell all of my max level TSE loot drops to vendor bots. All fucking 0 of them.
---
It sounds easy in theory, but the game weighs the two with a very fine scale. I couldn't name how many times since FO3 or 4 I've bashed when I wanted to throw, or vise versa.
---
Totally agree. People are getting bored so decide to ruin peoples fun instead
---
You mean like your claim of it being fake? 
---
Annnnd were done here. 
---
Right? These items have been passed through almost all of our hands when trading with others. Who knows where it’s all at now. I’ve had 100’s of legendary items drop, almost all crap so either I have awful luck or the good stuff is rare and when browsing the market subs you see them everywhere. I’ll guarantee most of them are dupes.
---
Straight up I’m gonna say I don’t agree. I just don’t see it. I have no fucking idea how anyone can play more than 2h and die of Boredom. I’m no stranger to mmos or the grind. But this game lacks polish at the least. It lacks any sustenance and will not be able to sustain even a small player base. People thought eso was a bad mistake. This game is like selling a broken demo for full price. The PvP is garbage and pointless, the pve is less the repetitive trash. It’s literally the same thing over and over no change or challenge. I applaud those who played it for the 100%. But to those who find it “fun” or support it, you are doing more damage than not. This game needs to die so Bethesda can fix it. But knowning then they will just cut support and work on es6. Just keeping it real no hate towards anyone was intended. Fuck Bethesda they whaven’t made a good game since Skyrim the first time they released it. And arguably Skyrim is a downgrade from there past games, atleast you can see effort and support in the game. Let’s not even mention lack of patch support. Anyways I’m droning. Thanks and peace 
---
One of the dumbest things I’ve ever read considering that the Atom store is unironically the result of capitalism.
---
I killed the 149 easily and the level 60 had hp like a legendary 3* scorched beast queen. 
---
Is that from fallout 76 or fallout 4?
---
How the game will look a year later: still bugged as fuck, and abandoned.
---
I have to agree. I am seeing squads guarding players with bounties over 1000 caps to lure people in and smite them. I kind of like the idea and occasionally accept the challenge and die miserably, base destruction is a little over the top tho. Go destroy a workshop maybe, or at least destroy the base of a known high level player who can easily rebuild. No harm, no foul.
---
Jut wait 5 mins for mw and fellow 140s to one shot them or better yet find a high level in your lobby and ask them to take them out
---
Why should we thank them for doing what they’re supposed to do?
---
I've your anti and hope we meet on the battlefield.  
---
Just so you know, your regular armor is irrelevant inside of power armor.
---
Did it seem like he had an explosive weapon? They hurt pretty bad.
---
I'd give my left testicle for this.
---
NP. I beat my head against the same wall till I found that thread!
---
I find a ton of it using Pharma Farma
---
you should get a bonus with western / single action revolvers, lever actions, and bowie knife, and a penalty to every other weapon.
---
Endurance maybe. I chose damage and defence perks so I eat a ton. I don't mind. That's the point of the perk cards. If we start getting these for free then we will all be specialised. Someone else was asking for lock picking and camp perks. Another says crafting. This is why we have to pick.
---
Also you aren't ignoring the other commenters points because they're "distracting from the main thrust of your argument". 
---
You're ignoring them because they effectively refute your argument and you don't know how to deal with that.  I would recommend you look up the term "straw man fallacy".
---
They just patched out the most common used exploit to duplicate items, and have started banning players who have made youtube videos showing off.
---
What more are you asking for?
---
The group I saw today was all level 125 and up. And the level 200 people dont seem to care.
---
Try Emmett Mountain Disposal Site (east of The Whitespring).
---
You can also farm mutations at the same time there.
---
Nope.I get crashes ,disconnects ,infinite loading screen ,black screen. It's a mess
---
But they are pro drug abuse and give you buffs if you get addicted ? I highly doubt they are so hypocritical.
---
I've noticed you get more space building over/near water. So maybe depending how busy the area is in terms of scenery and objects is a factor? I can't prove it though.
---
Yeh i know about regular armor not being relevant in PA but thought it mighve effected it somehow? From what i saw he had a pretty average weapon looked like a pistol of sorts? Never got a good look of it sadly
---
It could have been under the blueprint tab... I'm not  100% sure.
---
Lieutenant Dan? You got no legs.
---
They are a joke on the Alexa and Google devices talking to each other on YouTube.  They have the same speech patterns.  
---
Ran into them twice.
---
Free Wooby!
---
I’ve had some pretty screwed up pvp encounters and I can’t say I can explain this one. One thing of note tho is you are “naked” in power armor. You do not wear your armours.
---
Hit me up at Kingarmstrong81 on live
---
The most useful and upsetting information I've read in a long time, which is saying a lot considering I had surgery a week ago lmao. Thank you for crunching some numbers on behalf of the community. Please excuse me while I set my ps4 on fire :).
---
Did you message them? The only reason I don't go after people with bounties is because I don't constantly check the map. I wish the game would alert people to when someone gets a bounty
---
I've started carrying it around for this exact reason, whenever I find grahm or the charleston vendor I let loose like 40 flares into the sky
---
Nobody has actually come to me because of them yet
---
For me, the PipBoy and the Map sometimes report different weights. There are times where one will show that I am not encumbered and the other shows that I am.
---
I have all mutations and use Deep Pocket on most of my armor which may add to the complexity.
---
Be careful what you hope for, you might end up like Maddigen.
---
depends on build your trying to go for or have an idea..
---
Rifle(Hunting rifle,handmade,combat rifle) 
---
Melee(Sledge Hammer,fire axe think there low levels)
---
Pistols(probably 10mm)
---
Heavy(dont think heavy spawns in lower than 35)
---
if your on ps4 i can make them for you.
---
I happened across Noclip’s Making of Fallout 76 that came out in June. The way Todd talks about it, back then, there plan was to have a bumpy launch because the nature of the project and the company’s prior experience meant that they’d reach a point where they couldn’t polish or improve the game without players doing what we’ve been doing these two months. He sounds excited about it. It’s probably why their reactions aren’t consistent with disaster. This was part of the development plan and not maliciously so. 
---
I get that there are still bugs from FO4, but the team running the game is in a different studio, so it’s understandable if not ideal. And they’ve been fixing them. 
---
Ah, hadn't gotten quite so thoroughly caught up with that thread since yesterday. Thanks for the link
---
No, good point too. 
---
you can’t farm for anything in this game the drop rates are fucking terrible they need to address that. You should be glad duper’s made it affordable for you to have items worth a damn. I’ve played since release and everyday the beta was available and have not received one explosive weapon as a drop. 
---
The first real patch nerf spawns 3stars drop nothing or 2-1star item. It’s complete bullshit.
---
Im not saying I agree with RMT, but this game is fucked  and they keep fixing other shit! 
---
I think Nuclear gen. should be just fine for you.
---
That outrage is 100% nontroversy. It's like they introduced a cash shop **years ago...**
---
Bb
---
Its level 4.....
---
In ark you have to eat and drink constantly but you do have fridges to craft and store food.... If I’m expected to eat and drink constantly with out some form of food storage I don’t think a slight reduction in consumption rate is unreasonable. I’m aware of the “perks” and the with salt card to preserve food a little longer.... still needs a nerf imo.
---
That’s a dumb system then.  Who the hell thinks server hopping like that is fun and compelling gameplay?
---
... but, mein Fuhrer... you have no left testicle!

in fact i AM on ps4 and i’ll take whatever i can get! psn tag’s Enlighteninq

Ha with an outerworlds as at the end. Is this viral marketing?
---
Do me it’s very meh but it’s still enjoyable and scratches my fallout itch.
---
My disappointment comes from the state the game was released in and knowing that this game could’ve been so much more. I don’t find myself nearly as immersed as other Bethesda games unfortunately.
---
I've heard using that perk can get the players you revive addicted to alcohol.  Kind of awesome lol.
---
I hear that. 
---
I'd love a box that others could loot (like a personal "Overseer's Stash".  I'd love to be able to set one up outside my door where I can drop extra meds and plans (especially plans) so that other players could randomly come by and see if there is anything useful.
---
I will not thank them for trying to fix their broken product or for not giving up on it. They barely got away from getting sued. 
---
I just feel bad for the talented people who work at Bethesda. They knew the game is not ready but they had to release it before RDR2 because somebody at the top said so. Next time listen to the people who are making the product not the ones who are selling it.
---
I don't have the power user perk, but I was concerned how fast I went through cores yesterday enough to ponder grabbing the perk.  I dumped like 10-15 cores before the patch, now I am regretting it.
---
wont be on till like 10pm central at work.. but i got you..what type of build do you have? or are aiming for? if you have an idea.
---
Pvp damage scales, low levels can royally fuck up a high level with a decent weapon.
---
It wasn't magic.   
---
First off, I don't preorder, thats something we should all know by now.  
---
Secondly, I haven't forgiven them.  I've seen them rectify the problem.  Thats when the complaints should stop.  
---
Otherwise its just a circle jerk, which this post is.
---
Nice meme but seriously you understand your virtue signaling against a cash shop is **years late**
---
Didn't see this much noise made when Bethesda *introduced* a cash shop in their games... Which leads me to believe your meme is a symptom of a circle jerk
---
Yeah it's definitely getting old.
---
Oh you know. Launching a nuke down and farming. Dont forget those scorched beasts. 
---
Literally nothing else. 
---
They had a release planned for Black Friday. Remember the console + game bundle for Xbox? They committed $$$$ to that and would have taken a breach of contract from Microsoft if they missed the black Friday Bundle relase
---
same
---
Stacked bobbleheads?
---
Highest concentration of enemies by a wide margin.
---
Early game its a boon for fast leveling.
---
Late game its a boon for legendary farming.
---
/r/nocontext
---
Yeah, workshop defenses are nothing like the scale he’s suggesting.
---
I wish people would on my servers. 99% of the time I never seen people with bounties and if it there is it's someone who has 5 - 10 caps. I'm RPing as a Sheriff that hunts bounties so I'm constantly looking lol. Sorry to hear that though I don't mind raiding but I despise people who destroy people's bases. I'm all for PVP but not destroying something that cost ridiculous amount of resources.

Great video, very touching.

Enclave is still more appealing, though.

I wonder how it'd go down if they added something similar in 76 with a subscription.

It's you that should beware of your desire, like Perseus, I too carry something in my bag.

I have also noticed improved frame rate, or maybe just higher stability of frame rate. I was suffering a steady drop/stutter randomly, and of course some parts of the Wastes just seemed to have a heavier burden.
---
No noticed improvement in loading times, but I'm in the boons of Northern California &amp; have 18 Mb/s cable.

I'm not sure if I'm screwing myself with my setup or not, I get the impression as with most games it doesn't have much in the ways of SLI optimization (my setup is a bit Frankenstein atm, I've got another one of the ASUS &amp; a HB Bridge in the wings, currently using two of the old style ribbons seems to work).

I'm GregKot on there too. I'm on for the next few hours (or should be anyway). Thanks :D
---
Pop Addictiol every once and awhile cause the nerfs will be there but the effect wont
---
I play alone too just cause I can’t find ppl to play with. Most days I can coast but there are those moments when you get over run by something many levels ahead.
---
wut. Popeye ate spinach and he was a unarmed build. Imagine if he had a super sledge.
---
No one ever tells you how much of a time suck adulting is as a kid.
---
Yeah that would be great. Imagine a gang vs gang battle. Shooting from each fortress 
---
Oh shit. You’re right. 
---
Just place it right next to the bed
---
i’m honestly not focusing on a specific build and I’m just trying to get a feel for the game. i’m using whatever works and whatever has high dmg atm.
---
Did I say something was wrong? 
---
Didn’t think so. 
---
 No witch hunts. 
---
I ended up with a nice black cowboy hat in my inventory. I have no idea how I got it.
---
I still don't think Bethesda is in a place to give them dispensary action. The EULA is still too loose that they should legally not have any punishment since this is all in game exploits and not an outside tool. Honestly, I'm more upset if this is true.
---
You have to look at exploits much like piracy. There's a reason people do them and that's what you need to focus on. A large number of them that are wide spread such as the carry weight and exp ones were an answer to fundamental issues the game is still facing. Then we have to look at the duping as an extreme solution from people that just want to enjoy the game in a different way. Yes it made the the players on the server have issues, but that is the only thing that negatively impacted anyone. It did not hurt a non-existent in game economy. We cannot forget that this game was pitched as a single player game as well and some people want the ease of not having to deal with features that were clearly for multiplayer.
---
I enjoy and support Bethesda to patch every issue across the board, but they need to learn something from every one. This is not a fight they should start until then because it will only bring extreme backlash.
---
Makes sense to me. Lol. 
---
They are banning the Carry Weight exploiters next
---
Not sure if it’s cause I’m leveling or it’s the patch or they didn’t patch the right things but I’ve crashed more and more since patch came out :)
---
Theres a ghoul farming spot and with the nuke they spawn cooler shit sometimes.
---
No... Most of the railways are linked actually
---
Watoga, Whitesprings station and R&amp;D station are the only unique ones

All the others share

More like a headsup tbh do with that informative what you like.
---
ur names zombie u madman
---
&gt; I can’t remember a new Bethesda game being released recently besides Doom that was a big hit. (Please remind me if I’m wrong 
---
Wolfenstein didn't do too badly.
---
this is how I understand PvP in FO76:
---
BadGuy hits you, and does nothing for damage.  Even TSE guns just tickle.  Regardless of any armor you have on... he's wasting more weapon condition and ammo on you for nothing.
---
You turn around and shoot BadGuy.  You get full damage on your attack.  And now PvP is normalized between you and BadGuy PLUS any teammates both of you have. 
---
If you did not one shot him, then he can one shot you.  He can also seek revenge and one shot you if he gets the drop on you.  Until the revenging stops within the whole group, pvp damage will be normalized.  Once it's stopped, everyone goes back to doing what people around here call "slap" damage.
---
Now, to answer the one shot question.  The way my build is now, I can one shot someone without any special weapons.  With a VATS crit I can oneshot another player with just a plain lever action rifle.  Power Armor or not.  Things like the Adrenal Reaction mutation, and the Bloody Mess perk add crazy amounts of damage output.
---
Now, level 40 he probably didn't have that crazy of a build.  But if he had a TSE (two shot explosive) weapon, he's pretty much going to one shot you regardless of any build.  Because the damage output on those weapons is just ridiculously stupid high.
---
I think people who don't like it are toxic, and can't be cured. We can't change those people.
---
ahh well then melee probably has highest base damage for you since its the only weapon class that scales with special points(Strenght) unless you have perks  already for the other weapons
---
Unless it doesnt show bobbleheads during trade then no, he was offering to trade us some meds but there were no bobbleheads there
---
I've gotten plans from lvl 3 safes.
---
i’m level 40 and i’ve never found a legendary anything. what am i doing wrong?
---
There goes half your CAMP budget.
---
Server hopping sometimes works, the move camp one works for sure.
---
Its literally a game element. Why is there perks associated with it, if it was not intended to be played as such.
---
Same, todays were cause I was collecting nuclear material. I’d be ok if it didn’t remove quest items or mats for a quest item :/ I also scrapped piece of power armor cause the screen skipped.
---
The title says Fallout 76.
---
I think there's either a plan for that one, or you can pick one up somewhere. I saw one right after I used some Atoms for a brown one... LOL
---
He isn't
---
You didn't notice that? Haha
---
I have to use Rad-X before I go fight queen, otherwise I can't heal fast enough through it's bullshit-barrage
---
Same for big wads of enemies, like Mr. Gutsys spawning during Census Violence...
---
I love the game as well but the only things that I have a love hate with is they should’ve waited longer and fixed a lot of annoying but not entirely game breaking bugs. Little things like bad rendering and seizure HUD as well as glitches (exploits)really broke the game when it came out and I like certain ones and hate others but they are obviously trying. I still love the game❤️❤️❤️
---
Yea so A, were not in court. You don’t work here.

Can a fanbase rewrite canon? I think this is the player base rewriting canon. The brotherhood could do with my technical skills. I've already recovered almost all of the brotherhood technology that Taggerty and her team had learned and developed. I've smuggled more information out of the enclave than I ever thought possible. Ad victorum.
---
Pretty sure I could have said "one" a few more times.
---
Yeah but if you don't like fallout 3/4/76 your toxic, we can't cure them people. It's fine for bethesda too retconn the lore, it's not as big as a deal as they make out, but if obsidian does it WELL ILL BE ROOTED UP!
---
Care to take us on?
---
i wont haha. then ill make a shotgun for you.. shotgun has 3 different sets of perks but 2 fall under the strength category.just a heads up..not sure on pistol...im a rifle build
---
Farm legendaries at whitesprings, I have a crud ton of explosive legendaries, though they aren't good for enemies that charge up to you because the explosive effect will damage you as well. I prefer two shot because they do the same amount of damage, or even executioner's because once you get past 50% health they die easily. I use a 3 star two shot Gatling with 40% fire rate increase and +1 agility and a 3 star executioner's baseball bat with %40 increased swing speed, and reduced weight. Modded each weapon does 160+ damage per shot/swing. That's not including perks at that. But yeah farm three star ghouls for good weapons. 
---
I've had the same happen, I think it's a bug, I would not touch someone and they would melee me then shoot me for full damage somehow without mutual PvP engaged. I believe some people know how to do it on purpose too.
---
&gt;First they are coming for the YouTubers, but how far will this be taken?

Here's my tiny violin.  🎻
---
Would you like some cheese with that wine?  Oh no!  They are requiring people play an online only game without abusing glitches.  The huge manatee!  What's next?  Will schools require people not to cheat?!  We have to stand up and tell them, "We will not do anything honest!  Even if you make us!"
---
GTFO here with you concern trolling.
---
With the rate of people stopping because no content, if they delay new content too much, then not many will be around to enjoy the bug fixes
---
im not sure many more people will buy the game tomorrow because a bug is fixed, most of the people who are willing to deal with bugs are already here. but there are people who arent going to log in tomorrow if theres no new content

I play in pacifist mode because PVP isn't even in a pre-alpha state atm.

Oh good job, you can read :) 
---
Let's work on your shapes next!
---
Are you down to go the whole nine yards and take the boss down? I'm going for the whole Brotherhood experience. 
---
That will just force them to cover their identity in the future, it won't stop hacks or even slow them down that much.
---
Yea the world building is great. I was playing with my step dad yesterday, we were at the Civil War museum and I needed 1 more toy to scrap for the daily. I mentioned it to him and he’s like, “I bet there’s a gift shop here. And if I was placing a gift shop, I’d put it riiiiight here at the end of the tour.” Sure enough, there it was. No toys for sale, but I found a teddy bear there by an overturned baby carriage. 
---
I complimented his cleverness and under his breath I hear him go “I love this game.”
---
thanks dude! i think my strength is at like 3. i’ll take whatever i can get though.
---
Modern Fireplace. Costs 700 atoms, though. Keeps my common room cozy with its bearskin rug and rocking chairs.
---
And if you want a camp without broken windows, get the brick set.
---
Hahaha
---
What's a shape? Bug or feature?!
---
I just want a Flare Machinegun.  I mean, technically flares are phosphorus rounds, right?
---
Free fast travel to somewhere near them would be handy too. I've spent 30 caps to get to a 40 cap bounty but by the time I got there the bounty had dropped to 20 caps.
---
If I'm reading their blog post correctly, that's supposed to be coming in the next patch. 
---
Yu no gaem real fuen like two shot ppl an callct junk game grate
---
I do play with a RL friend but we keep to ourselves most of the time. I still help him with some quests but I mostly let him do his own thing while we talk.  I came into this game and wanted to start making friends but like usual, I ended up doing the loner thing again like I always do in online games.  One thing I have yet to do is send a nuke.  Still haven't done the main quest or visited any of the silos but i'm in no hurry.  Maybe one day.
---
Check out r/Fo76Brotherhood if you’re looking for a great group of brothers and sister to fight along side you! Enlist today!
---
Same here
---
Was a really cool episode. Nice to see Gun Jesus show his love for the finer things
---
I must truly be getting old because I immediately recognized that song and had flashbacks to getting killed repeatedly with the golden gun.
---
Because Bethesda.
---
heh
---
Screenshot?
---
I just want the game to run better
---
Its actually better for low levels to nuke prime. When the queen spawns its scaled off the level of the person who launched the nuke. If a high level spawns her there's a good chance you don't have enough fire power on the server to kill her
---
I think the word you're looking for is scorch.
---
Maybe Bull Dozer effect? You are covering up a terrain feature?
---
Damn son. If I could give you gold, I would.
---
I sold one a while back because I didn't like the semi auto fire. Don't find enough handmade to scrap for automatic receiver. 
---
Down 
---
Come on, it was the Lucky 83.
---
Also my psn is Official_Itachi lol 
---
Listen, there is \*plenty\* to complain about in 76, but nothing is even close to epic dumpster fire that is Atlas.
---
Well my first base where near water and my build area were smaller than its now...but seems like my build limit is also smaller
---
And what is rank 1?
---
Time for your medication and a nap... shhhhh
---
Same. Also when trading with players or vendors. It sucks.
---
is vary good I til yu
---
There are two boyfriend extraction spots in the game.  One's near the university and the other's down by the mines.  Depends on if you want something sensitive and intellectual or a bit of rough and tumble.  Production rates are accelerated if you wear the swimsuit or ratty dress.  Oddly, the mascot suit has a really high rate down near the mines.  Must have been big furry fans.
---
probably the satisfaction of finding them from earlier games like fo4 lol
---
I ended up with this outfit and 2 of the BoS Bomber Jacket outfits from random quest reward too.
---
Allready scraped blueprints..
---
Some items shown arent ingame yet
---
Climax and Calm are two very different experiences. Calmex is what you're looking for though.
---
Last week Grahm helped me take down that awful sentry bot on the highway just north of Whitesprings. He's a total bro and has great prices on a wide variety of merchandise. A++ would buy again
---
me and frund lik go to wite hawse n shawt goils
---
I picked up a lvl 45 Tesla Rifle with Troubleshooters (+30% to robots).  Perfect for Watoga.  The only drops I get are the shitty ones where you get revived after death or the gain dmg resistance with lower health.
---
Tried that and still happens. Every time i get close to an event it shuts down.
---
sure looks like it =P.
---
As someone said earlier... this is the exact same developer room from FO4.  Though, who knows if it really exists in FO76.  Looked convincing, but definitely not where people got their legendaries.
---
I think its the legendaries... 
---
Get yourself to Harper's Ferry and server hop into you find the handmade plans, then keep building and scrapping as often as you can to learn mods. 
---
There's a song in that somewhere
---
Yeah they are trying really hard to earn back as much money as they can. If they were actually trying they would y’know release a good game instead of fixing it after release.
---
Maybe they'll acknowledge the player's actions and decrease the perceived threat in the Appalachian area. Automated tour busses could show up as travel points.
---
I never said anything at all about damage being balanced or not. I just said it shouldn't break so easy.. Did you pull that out of you A** jist to,try and make a point? Lol. Ok dude.
---
The best low level weapon is a charming smile combined with a gracious wit.
---
It’s fake.  Duh. 
---
where are the plans in harper’s ferry?
---
Its correct. The same study from 1945 that says you need 8 glasses of water per day also states that most of this water can be gotten from the other food and beverages that you consume. Over the years that part has been forgotten so the 8 glasses of water thing has become accepted even though there is no evidence that drinking that much water really has any additional health benefits.
---
yes we go an sut al th monstr an wind legendwaries
---
I got addicted to the tea at the giant tea pot.  I would do the daily and quest just to have the water and per+, then i found that damn robot was just drugging me.   Screw those pipes is what i say.....
---
I've crafted one before, don't recall the requirements though, see if the mats list has a "scroll down" your missing.
---
and also a knack for getting high levels to give you shit
---
Sent you a request. I'm overweight so if you could come to me that would be great
---
When nuked, all of the ghouls spawn as bloated glowing ones level 62.  So, pretty high level.  It's the concentration of enemies that leads to higher legendary spawn rates, and since they are all over level 50, higher chance of lvl 45+ legendaries.
---
my dad hast cam hoem in 15 yr
---
I take the "GTA prostitute approach". 
---
Ask for directions, trade, then murder. 
---
I don't know how to respond to that
---
Nope the good is overshadowed by the bandwagon
---
It had a launch as stable as literally any other modern online game...
---
It has bugs as typical as any Bethesda game, not more...
---
It's marketing was as good as any other games if not better due to an original cover song that was so good it was demanded to be released for example. If that isn't proof enough the marketing got people to drop 200+ for a collector's edition of the *first Bethesda online multiplayer fallout*... If that isn't good marketing idk what is 😂 
---
Plus the nuka rum bottle marketing that was also so good people imagined some hundred dollar glass blown bottle instead of what the videos showed and marketing speak implied...
---
Cash grab nature should've been the default mood towards 76, not some faux woke enlightened idea. They said it was a spin off. A multiplayer spinoff from Bethesda. So basically a fallout 4 multiplayer mod... Who expected anything more in between the tent pole titles??
---
The game launched objectively poor but it was not outrageously bad. However for many YouTubers that's literally all they need for a monetized 10 minute+ video that benefits from validating reddits opinion...
---
There are no more dupers yet PC users are crashing more after the update!
---
You can find one on the back of a wheelchair in the whitesprings golf club on the ground floor.
---
Pretty much everyone who has built one chose to do so on their own. Its been really fun to see what people come up with.
---
You can pick one up off the skeleton in a wheelchair at the whitesprings club house. 
---
Yes, after update me server kik me aut every 15-20min.... 
---
What if... You start shooting random pedestrians and eating their corpses?!?!?!
---
Can we consider adding text chat to the game soon please?
---
They paid what is it like 9k caps to write that? 
---
You realize that a lot of us actually enjoy the game? It can definately depend on perspective. For me, I have not had that any major problems or the constant disconnects some talk about. I saw someone earlier today post that the server stability has been worse since yesterday's patch and they were getting disconnected every 5 mins. But I haven't had a single disconnect in that same period.  Not sure why some people have WAY more problems than others unless the issues are more client side than server maybe
---
How much for excavator shocks?
---
It's just a lower chance to get rid of it. Not 100% though
---
You need to use explosives
---
I literally sell almost every super stimpack I find because regular ones work fine and are ridiculously abundant. Supers just weigh far too much for my tastes. 
---
Not trying to start an argument just generally curious. Why are you so opposed to people being able to respec easily? It doesnt mess bother you at all if I repsec to make a rifle build instead of big guns.
---
ye
---
It's a trap!
---
Yes that's a big thing for me too, being able to enter a building without it needing to continually load different sections is a great improvement.
---
it’s almost as if duplication of extremely powerful weapons destroyed it?
---
not sure if serus
---
Yes, this would definitely help. It doesn't help me to know something is .01 lbs but i have 1000 of them. Yeah I can do that math but that's pretty laborious.
---
They have that fire place, been eyeballing but my camp is not in a cold area
---
Oh no, my weakness! Somebody who's been to the wikipedia page on informal logical fallacies. If only we were having a formal, moderated debate about why we should or should not appreciate the efforts of a company to make it's product better.
---
My source is being a game developer myself, and being close friends with many developers within indie and AAA studios.
---
The devs dont get paid any more if a game sells terribly. Even if it sells well. Why wouldn't they try to make the most with what they're given and put care into something?
---
The only reason any developer gets into the field is because they love doing it and have a passion for it. They put the most they can into these games within their power. Sometimes they're on board with an idea, sometimes they arent but they still have to develop it. Why would they get a job in such a challenging and exhausting field if they didnt have a passion for it and their customers and communities? It isnt a job you get into just for the money. It's a lot harder than you realize.
---
I visited Hillbilly Hotdogs *years* ago when I was backpacking around the US. Was pleasantly surprised to see a parody of it :)
---
I expect to die.  I expect you to die more, and poor.  Your head will have pride of place on my spikes.
---
Lmao, grave digging huh?
---
nice 
---
Maybe try uploading them so they appear on your feed? Other than that I don’t know if you can, thats the only thing I can think of.
---
This is a survival-light game, but ffs, it's still a game, not a life-simulator...
---
Those poor Youtubers. They hardly even used the exploits. Look, they're crying. Won't someone please think of the Youtubers!
---
I agree with this, but tbh I was so excited to finally get a chance to try it I just wanted it now lmao. 
---
You spelled sirius wrong
---
Losing caps if it gets high enough is a repercussion. 
---
Ooooh. I did not know that was a thing. I will keep am eye for it.
---
Is there a place I can buy it? Or I can only unlock it by scrapping machetes?
---
I bought the girls one with Atoms
---
my guy looks good in heels witha  frilly collar.
---
Do vendors sell the same plans if you come to my world? Thought you could come here and buy it from them.. Could be wrong idk.. Just trying to help people out. 
---
Im from WV and my only issue so far that i was upset about is Camden Park haunted house wasnt there. I know size wise it's not big but when you talk about the park haunted house is one of the things that will come up first.
---
Did you really sit down and decide that this was the best use of your time?
---
I don't think you're being serious, but yeah, I realized that they're likely not going to ban much in the game because there is already worse language throughout the Fallout games.
---
isn't that the nice lady that lives in my phone?
---
Delete you duped goods.
---
Wait, how does this 'take forever' and 'consume a ton of inventory space'? xD
---
I'm sure there are better ways to make caps, and maybe the ones you mentioned are just that. Which is fine. But stay factual please... this method takes one hour to get enough stuff to vendor for two days of cap resets. That is hardly 'forever'. And I don't know which world you're living in but this method also does not take up a lot of inventory space... at all... the suits weigh next to nothing, same with the gold and cloth and acid. And yes, you DO get 1800+ caps for an hour's work.
---
Your alternate suggestions are appreciated but please put down the 'making shit up today' pills. You seriously just wasted my time posting that nonsense, lol.
---
Agreed. This is something I've been asking about for months. 
---
Don't even think it'd be that hard to change in the game either. It's not like you need to introduce a new mechanic.
---
Pistols are agility if I remember correctly
---
I was in my CAMP near the Whitespring when I got the radio message about Poseidon power plant malfunctioning. For no reason. The event wasn't even happening. I didn't get the quest. It just gave me the radio audio.
---
Are you Gary?
---
one more time, precisely
---
I found a dead deathclaw once and its inventory name was "caravan merchant" or something close to that. Stuff like this makes me all giddy and happy to see.
---
It's getting a lot worse. But that's gonna happen as the game gets updates, gets better, and grows. It sucks, but part of the community. 
---
Nice twist
---
Yeah that's nice and then when they teleport to the other side of the map. How much is that 20 caps really worth to you. If you know the spawn in points and have chameleon you could just fast travel all over the place and watch as they run around wasting their caps hehe.
---
what a load of bullshit
---
"Level" as in completely destroy; flatten ... not "level" as in increase your player level.  
---
It's unlikely Bethesda (or Microsoft) ever intended for the XB1 to (truly) multitask like that. The XB1 is designed to dedicate most of it's resources to the primary application in order to provide the best performance. When you run another app, it will attempt to take resources from the now-secondary app. That's what you're seeing. There won't be a fix as the issue is caused by behavior rather than any sort of error. 
---
Please note: I've zero experience with attempting to multi-task on the XB1.  I could be dead wrong.  If other have a different experience, please feel free to correct my. 
---
You can unplug him
---
gotta make sure you pick up whatever adhesives you run across in the wastes man, might make things a lot easier :/ 
---
Yeah I got the grafton lake/waste barrels when I was very far west from the lake itself. Still ran over to complete it, have the agility, but I certainly didn't expect it to start up. 
---
On Xbox One, I can't align the game screen with my TV. When you first get the game it let's you line up the screen, etc. with your TV, but after that you can't change this setting. After getting a new TV, things extend past my screen and I can't adjust it. Please add in this missing setting!
---
Saving levels will stop it from unlocking.
---
Do you need Adhesive? I'll trade you some for caps, plastic, or shotgun shells.
---
Special thanks to u/Vault101manguy 
---
Your experiment with the Murder Church and the Roast House made me try this kind of stuff. It sure gives more life to 76's endgame!
---
There's a quest at the northwest corner of the map where you have to use a grill to cook food, which makes me wonder why the hell you can't cook food in it at the camp
---
Don't you still get the melee bonuses though? I thought it only removes the healing and food/water recovery from meat
---
What is Atlas?
---
Same happened to me but with Master shotgunner apparently its a bug that there is no fix for. 
---

---
Thank you for contacting the Bethesda Customer Support Team.  
---
This is Jarrod here again, and I can see you are still having issues with your character perks in Fallout 76. After reviewing your screenshot this does provide proof this is indeed a bug and it needs to be reported.  
---
To provide feedback select"Fallout 76" and choose the "Feedback" category under "Submit a Ticket" at the bottom of the [help website](https://help.bethesda.net/app/home/track/AvP4jgrDDv8Q~eU3Go8a~yJdLgMqrC75Mv~Q~zj~PP8Z).  T**his feedback will be provided to the development team and you will not receive a direct response. We pass your feedback to the development team daily.**    
---
I usually just farm it the easy way by hitting areas with high concentrations of adhesive.
---
I’m not going to thank them till I can play the game longer than 10 mins with out running into a game breaking bug..
---
Shame not everyone is sharing your enthusiasm. Other people are crashing like never before.
---
They don't want to put any content behind a pay wall. Only thing beneficial of a subscription would be a discount from the store and free points each month. 
---
On ps4 you can screenshot and report.
---
Will probably result in a temp ban
---
Cricket is the absolute best
---
Youre right you are supposed too. Im terribly unhealthy. Maybe i should take a cue from this game.
---
I agree and hope the positive trend continues. 
---
Damn Communists. Lazy MFs...
---
Haven't noticed AP drain, but I'm going through power cores like crazy. Went through three in like an hour today.
---
I like him as a character, but does he actually sell anything good? I keep seeing posts popping up with people desperately looking for him, but every time I've found him he's just sold the same plans and items as any Responders vendor.
---
Yes 
---
They could have ten more patches this last ones size and it would still be a broken as fuck game. Praise them when the game isn't fucking shit anymore. 
---
I heard the steakhouse that is north of watoga is a good farming point for legendaries as it spawns a large amount of high level super mutants. Ive been there once and it seems like a good place.
---
You, I like you.
---
Yeah, and fallout 4 is based off the skyrim engine
---
and the skyrim engine is based off the fallout 3 engine
---
and the fallout 3 engine is based off the oblivion engine
---
and the oblivion engine is based off the morrowind engine
---
They won't abandon this game if the micro transactions are even mildly successful. 
---
I think they should make explosive a primary legendary so you can only have explosive or 2 shot
---
A. Kill Enemy / Fast Travel  
---
B. Crouch / Wait until HIDDEN / Fast Travel
---
Heh, sounds like my hacking method, which is to pop open the terminal, try the three easiest-to-reach words on the board, and if none of them is the password, exit and repeat. Usually takes less time than agonizing over which words match N letters.
---
You just described grindly gameplay. Not everyone is into that.
---
If you go in the service entrance, look on top. There's a caps stash and duct tape.
---
I was having the same problem but it turned out that they were being stored as blueprints. You might want to check that out if you haven't already.
---
But they are giving us all content updates for free.
---
No no no, that's Cyrus.
---
Just lists the 3 things sadly.  It’s no worries, I’m just gonna write it off.  I use power armor anyways, so it was more a check mark instead of a requirement.
---
I believe it's any machine as long as theres a pie inside
---
Rotting tato? Don't pick them until the whole crop is ready?
---
I haven't seen anything spoil on plant. May be wrong there but I wait until all are at fruition.
---
That said me scouring the Wastes has reward far more, but I reckon if one got super duper (oh the irony of that title) &amp; the perception card that doubles picked item, it should be viable with a small amount. I have 6 of each plant, keeps me sustained. 
---
what things have you tested? there are a lot of steps that can happen between "oh no i crashed" and "this must be bethesda's fault."
---
use luck boosting items
---
1,000 cap bounties for them all...Even after they are killed, another 1k bounty is immediately placed on them...And so on, I like your idea.
---
He has exclusivity to some building plans 
---
There's one or two that I'm always finding that I scrap for aluminium but for the life of me I can't remember what they are. 
---
Yesterday I bought the neon letter plans from the raider vendor near the top of the world and 5 minutes later I got disconnected, when I logged back in I had all my caps back and didn't have the plan =(
---
It was a mutant trapper left leg
---
Like what? I've never encountered a game breaking bug besides a crash
---
Are they actually going to ban ppl?
---
In the animal kingdom, genitalia is what you bite first; taking away the tool to reproduce is a big hit on any wild animal. It also gives and easy access entrance to dig into, avoiding fur. 
---
Consider it a bloody, backwards deepthroat if you will.
---
Posting to find this later at home. IGN: Sigarthas
---
I've never gotten one but I'm more of a social drinker, so it makes sense.
---
I think Bethesda prematurely released the game. The beta was not fully exploited. Fallout 76 attracted more than just the single player fallout fans from previous fallout games, but as it is a n open world online multiplayer, the pvp aspect attracted new members. when people started duping, many competitive players did not care whether the god gun they were getting through a trade was duped or not becuase in order to stay competitive in the meta, you needed a melee or tse build. I agree mass duping is discouragable, but you dont get mad when you get blasted by a tank in battlefield or blown up by a rocket in halo....If its in the game, so be it. It is ultimately up to Bethesda to fix the issue which they are trying and to save face while doing so. Just wipe everyones accounts and reset the entire fallout 76 world....only fix....
---
I honesty don’t like being alone in the game, it feels empty to me. But when I’m with a squad, it’s great fun!
---
I’m pretty sure the inventory is different for everyone 
---
Agreed. After installing patch. Crash 5 times. Pick up two 2 hands bloodied weapons and server crashed while farming at White spring. Server didn’t save either of them. SMH. 
---
I went from level 5 to 30 using just a Pipe Revolver Rifle w/o any Rifleman Perks.
---
The only time I ever had issues was fighting groups of Radscorpions, but that's only because they burrow like pussies.
---
I don't trust my power meter on my power armor.  I started using it for the first time in a fight situation yesterday, and I had a nearly full core.  A short time later it was at about 15%, but then I fast traveled to a zone and it was at something like 75-80%
---
The way it displays the value seems bugged for me.  (Pretty sure logging out while in it still sets it to 100 too)
---
Yargh
---
Just checking, you're looking for Expert Lockpick, not another Lockpick. Maybe you know, but worth a shot.
---
Wow, a thoughtful and honest response. I think I've stumbled into alternate reality internet.
---
reports are coming out that people have been.  "My friend was banned" type stories, but reports none the less.
---
Yes. It is completely unacceptable to be thankful for other people's work... Even when it's fixing a mistake.  God forbid, mistakes get made and then fixed....
---
And the Rum bottle was not anything. That was consumers blindly buying a liquor specifically for the bottle it came in, despite the fact that no one ever said it was going to be a custom bottle ever in any way shape or form.
---
What?! I've walked by that guy a million times, and never bothered to look at him.
---
The said they fixed the recharge from logging in the latest patch.  It's working on PC now... Consoles haven't gotten the patch yet I believe. 
---
Snowflakes are the war? Snowflakes never change.
---
This guy gets it.
---
Agreed as to Speed Demon aggravating this problem. However:
---
Well Fed and Hydrated bonuses are great, but they both give resistance to disease — plus bonuses to XP and AP respectively — and neither perk has anything to do with hunger (or the rates at which hunger is satisfied or the satisfaction persists).
---
Maybe he changed his name and went to the common wealth? Supermutant are immortal right?
---
Seriously the people can feed themselves until they fix this gd black hole of a container
---
If u on Xbox and want to sell ...
---
How do you need that much adhesive? I have a tiny farm with like a few crops each and I find I can't use up anywhere near enough of my stuff.
---
If you WANT a group to play with, there’s plenty of factions around! I belong to 2 in particular, one is more casual, the other is militaristic and organized, and holds he occasional RP faction event.
---
Congrats! I've been trying to get a new sniper rifle for awhile, my old one is too weak. 
---
I've been being disconnected more now but the game is running better and I'm not stuttering or freezing as much. Quite optimistic. 
---
If faction wars become a thing just auto lock the characters into the raider faction lol
---
Are you okay?
---
Anyone know if these still drop right now,  not being halloween anymore and all? 
---
Syringer
---
It's PvP, guy. That is allowed.
---
That's a good video BOS has always been one of my fave factions since the first game.
---
that said, the physics of standing at parade rest in power armor boggles my mind the ridgitity of the frame should make it impossible to bend your arms back like that. I'll take a closer look at the naked frame but I don't think the shoulders would allow you rotate the arms that far back.
---
Every single time I’ve played since launch it has been crashing about 10 mins after launch straight to the desktop. If it ends up not crashing the frame rate will drop to 5 FPS. Also every other time I load it up I instantly die and then the game will crash . Or I will take damage from nothing and it kills me then the game crashes, that one happened to me last night after the update. So yeah lots of game breaking stuff. 
---
Ok.  It seemed to still reset last night on the PS4 for me.  Guess I'll have to see this morning.
---
Luckily stealing Fusion Cores from Random power suit spawns is easy, so it isn't like it'll be hard to keep a supply even after they work right and before I can farm them up or charge them.
---
Yes, the ban wave has already begun and will continue.
---
Welcome to how online games work these days.
---
Mate, i dont even know how the duping thing works tbh.
---
It blends in rather well with the back of the wheelchair. Another player told me about it, and i've seen it there every time since then.
---
Then you start seeing thing in real life and only see what components they have  lol
---
I pop buffout, psycho, fury and psychobuff like candy and never been addicted. 
---
Ssshhhhh...let’s not fix this...
---
If you play on console it's probably the "wire bug". When you move your camp your connecting wires count towards the stored items even though you can't see them. 
---
Yeah. All the more reason I'd like to see an offline mode, or at least make it so other players are not visible to you and vice versa. I get that wasn't the intent, but I think there's enough people playing solo to warrant it. 
---
You wanted more content launched in the first 3 months?
---
Do you know this community? It would immediately be "This should have launched with the game, they just held off to look pro active"
---
And the game is not in the same state as launch. This recent patch and the December patch featured a total of what 300+ fixes
---
Tactics is not canon. There is no such thing as “semi-canon”. You might as well call it “alternative canon”.
---
It's it more that it's gotten less bad? Like the game should have been at this level of "goodness" but BGS launched WAY too early.
---
Equip starched genes AFTER you drink the mutation. After that it will remain permanent unless you take starched genes off
---
You dont uave to show everybody in order to show the developers though.
---
Yes, if you have Starched Genes maxed out radaways and such don not cure mutations. 
---
Level 92, and I as well like killing SBQ. Throw me on your team if anyone needs an additional raid mate. 
---
GT: Von Donginslong
---
Maybe a small experience boost too. I personally wouldn't mind a subsciption if the benefits were right. Can't speak for others though.
---
Whitesprings golf resort with all the ghouls, there's a skeleton in a wheel chair wearing an black tux on the backside of his chair  there's a black cowboy helmet

They can create new instanced maps like DLC from previous games. Have some location you "enter" that transports you there. 
---
Whe did you buy at? 
---
I get that reference!
---
I’ve yet to go to the dark side of duping but I totally agree on the drops. Have yet to see a two-shot anything let alone explosive and I’m level 68. Always the same trapper armor trash or crap melee weapon that does like 50 damage.
---
Or she was already a liar and a cheater and you expected her to be something she wasn't .....
---
I usually crash when trying to move these items so it makes sense 🤷‍♀️ I crashed three times in a row last night trying to sell some shoddy one star legendaries after a white springs run. I eventually gave up and just dropped them.
---
Can people get banned if they bought a duped weapon?
---
At this point it’s to little to late.
---
I’m not usually to harsh on companies as it’s a difficult thing they do.
---
However I’ve never seen a company fuck themselves in the ass as well as the customers as Bethesda has done with FO76.
---
From buggy release, to the bag scandal, to the run shenanigans.
---
Like they really tried to rob as much money as they could out of there loyal fan base of customers.
---
To the point I as a long term fan no longer have faith or trust in them.
---
Perfect example of years to build a reputation and trust, minutes to break it.
---
Who throws grenades at rad roaches lmao??
---
I hate to tell ya, and I mean no offense... but people are selling jetpack plans for ~6-7k caps. Server hopping just isn't the most reliable way to buy rare items these days.
---
Nope. Seems pretty normal to me.
---
So im screwed then basically
---
If you take RadX, however, it will temporarily neutralize the effects of the mutation, regardless of the Starched Genes perk.
---
eNtaK just did a video on this actually and proved that this is just a myth. [Here it is. ](https://youtu.be/rq5dIIhGdDs)
---
No, your weakness seems to be other people disagreeing with you on the Internet from your increasingly perturbed responses in this thread.
---
Also, the reason I bring up logical fallacies isn't because this is a moderated debate (yet another strawman, btw, at no point did I imply this was or should be moderated), it's because fallacious arguments hold no substance, and are usually just emotional manipulation in lieu of actually having a relevant point.
---
I agree. Not for free, but for a cost.
---
From a player
---
Just wait for the patch on monday (I think it is) and it should be fixed. 
---
That was a surprisingly good read.  Thank you for bringing that to my attention.
---
Huntersville is the one they're thinking of. Worth the mutants from West Tek research. 
---
Thanks...
---
Here's my big idea I haven't posted yet because I wanted it to be its own thing.
---
End game GROUP content where combat is only a part of it. The other portion would be group decision making and CAMP management.
---
What major landmarks do we have "close" to our map of WV? One of the biggest nationally known would be the Appalachian Trail. In case you don't know, the Appalachian Trail is a continuous trail along the entirety of the Eastern side of the US. [https://appalachiantrail.org/images/default-source/explore-the-trail/interactive-map-screenshot\_633x576.jpg?sfvrsn=95b8b1a0\_0](https://appalachiantrail.org/images/default-source/explore-the-trail/interactive-map-screenshot_633x576.jpg?sfvrsn=95b8b1a0_0) Every year tons of people make an effort to thru-hike (ayyye thats a perk!) the trail. That meaning going from one end to the other in one stretch. Pretty crazy endeavor to test your limits here in real life. Personally its my dream to do the Pacific Crest Trail, which is the same concept but the western side of the US.
---
ANYWAY.
---
Sooo that map linked is made for ants, where would this be located anyway? Turns out there's a hop on entrance literally just east of Harpers Ferry. See how the map has those railroads kinda fade off to the east of Harpers? Right around there would be the trail entrance.
---
Take a gander at google maps and follow the trail in WV. It basically lines the Eastern edge of the map all the way to Harpers, then splits NE. 
---
Plenty of good excuses could be made as to why we need to travel like this. Maybe the main highways are way to dangerous for one reason or another. Radiation pockets still settled in shitty spots, could be anything. Whatever reason that may be, the solution to get to where we need to go (or perhaps go to lead people back to WV? What if we were trail guides bringing people back?) would be keeping to the higher mountains ranges insulated by trees. 
---
The trail is commonly nicknamed "The Green Tunnel" as its quite a bit of the same scenery for a while, and you kinda have to overcome that feeling and press on. Part of the reason my personal dream is the PCT, quite a bit more variety.
---
That's important though. Basically means Bethesda would have essentially a blank slate as to what they could populate the wilds with. Detours, monsters, wherever their brains could take it. 
---
How would this correlate into PvE group content though?
---
Easy. 50% Oregon Trail 50% combat oriented. Maybe mix that ratio a bit more, but hey, its an approach. Hell they could literally give it an Oregon Trail art direction but slap Appalachian on it. Could totally see a little Vault Boy running around with OT art.
---
We could be forced to plan very particularly for the hike. Weight limits and values could be unique for the scenario. Force players to carry quite a bit less to play into the whole carry weight fanaticsm in the hiking community. Maybe have some "ultra-light" modeled stuff for people who complete it. For reference to people reading. Serious ultra light hikers do shit like drill holes in the handle of their spoon to cut weight down. It can get silly, but its honestly super impressive how little some people need to carry to be completely comfortable traveling long distance. Limit what the player can store for the CAMP by having workshop benches be unavailable unless at very specific check points, as how are you going to haul that shit through the woods? Each party member could be forced to kinda focus on a role and pack accordingly. Force people to work together as your party members will be better equipped for different situations. Have resupply that you set up sent ahead via a hacked bot high speed drop or oddly friendly MODUS just like how in real life you literally mail yourself supplies at pickup stations all along the trail.
---
We can have instanced ambushes, NPC interactions where we have to decide whether we trust someone or not. Injury and sickness to where your team has to help you or something. We're already all dying of dysentery, why not make it a tongue in cheek OG throwback? When stopping for the night, we all participate in CAMP resource collection from the surrounding area and getting defenses built. Have us have to defend from hordes in our little group CAMP desperation plot throughout the night.
---
They could FILL it with random encounters to where you never get the same hike twice. Peaceful, funny, difficult, sad, and scary moments would all be available.
---
I think it'd get a lot more people participating in the depth of the survival system as well. It's a great framework and obviously built as a mild difficulty slider as we manage it. It's at a reasonable point right now as its definitely supposed to be secondary to us roving around shooting shit. Why not have some content that reorients that emphasis?
---
Multiple runs with different groups can have you rank up as a Trail Guide. Have unique perk cards that make you a lot stronger in the scenario and give cool bonuses back in WV.
---
Maybe a way to start introducing NPCs again? No ones heard the news, so we go out there and spread it? 
---
Would be weird going all the way down the trail then walking back with the people though. Bet we could set it up with a vertibird 4 man speed flight and drop off at the refugee location. Obviously can't fly them back because of the people and belongings. 
---
It could be so god damn cool. We already have a TON of hiker themed stuff. We have a perk, outfits, ATOM store outfit, newly leaked "nature-y" stickerbombed Pip-boy paint (Common to do to your nalgene water bottle and stuff. Mines a gaudy mess with stickers peeling and shit. One hell of sturdy bottle though). 
---
Gotta be honest, almost thought the AT would be referenced in the game in some way already as I was surprised by the amount of outdoor rec included in the setting.
---
Yeah, I know. Which is why I would do an unlisted video for reporting a bug and I wouldn't show the steps in the other video, if I was creating a video on duping items.
---
I've never had an issue. press for power attack/bash and hold for grenade. not hard man
---
Game shouldn’t have been released in the state it was. 
---
If smoking is in the game then I want dancing, sex acts, drinking, drugs, the works! Don't stop at cigs!
---
Otherwise imma just flip and say "smoking is bad we shouldn't promote this on our youth! Shame!"
---
Lol just saying what a few are thinking 
---
And -95% player damage on all new weapons they pick up.
---
You can be killed without being able to retaliate...and you want *more consequences?*
---
The fuck is wrong with you?
---
It could have been someone's normal loot and they accidentally sold it then didn't have the caps to buy it back.
---
I won't argue. I play daily. Lvl 130 and loving it
---
no
---
Its 4X as big as 4's map and it is even more packed with fantastic places to explore and so many places to make a  camp
---
Well I got something useless with a TS, I don’t remember what.
---
No...  Fusion generator for camps have a permanent core in them and all it does is generate 100 power.  You can only make cores at power plant workshops. 
---
Yes. Why thank people who work for a company who had no part in the decision to release the game in the state it was. 
---
Hey graphic designer! Way to decide to launch the game in the state it was! This is your fault! You don't deserve any thanks for fixing some issues now! 
---
That is a GREAT idea!!  And if they weren't actually duping, then they can still play the game while they file an appeal to get the bounty off their heads.
---
So wait, when others calmly disagree about your favorite game it's "vitriolic" but when you tell someone to injure themselves it's a "joking quip" (usually jokes involve some kind of humor, but I'll admit comedy can be subjective.  Though given your taste in videogames I can understand why you think what you said was funny)
---
Grahm is the closest thing we have to a non-hostile human NPC. I miss the guy, I legit haven't seen him for like a month. 
---
Him and Rose are my 2 favorite things about this game,  I wish we got more of them.. 
---
Let me rephrase: Furious vampire anti armor buzzsaw **would be** the best melee weapon in the game.
---
Good to know. Ppl can get their foot jammed in their mouth now.
---
"Bethesda can't do anything about it"
---
Let's face it there is no way to complete block hackers or stop them, but the higher the consequence the less you will have.
---
It doesn't matter, the account gets banned not the character, lol.
---
Only dumb people think exploits have no consequences in 2018-2019.
---
No that's the friendly satellite people who play music.
---
Oh cool. Good riddance
---
Or over ten years ago with the whole horse armour thing.
---
Do you have to power up the power plant first?  Or can I just go to like... the Posiden workshop and capture it, and build something there to charge them?  Slightly off topic for this thread I know.  But just curious.
---
Np, and sorry mate. It could be something else, so this is just a possibility. 
---
She's a fkin snitch tho
---
I call BS there is no way you amke it through more than 1 reload.
---
Ok, its finished. 
---
I got the exact same amout. 12 purified water per hour.
---
This time, the 3 purifiers hit the storage limit, and I removed the water the second they hit it.
---
The other purifiers were there, but not powered on.
---
Im going to store all the other purifiers and see if it changes anything. 
---
There are two of them one with chaps and one without. You can get them along with other rare outfits from certain quests though the chances are about as low as getting a legendary item with more than 2 stars from a Legendary enemy with 3 stars(now).
---
That being said it's a good idea to complete any daily quests or events you can as they each have their unique pools. The Cowboy outfit can be received as a reward from **Buried with Honor** or **Big Game Hunter** in the Savage Divide. Dunno if there are any other quests that can reward it.
---
The *(BoS)Bomber Jacket* can be received from **Forbidden Knowledge** along with *faction paint jobs* for your power armor.
---
You don't deserve a medal for doing the bare minimum of what you're expected to do.
---
:o Raider! I'm more on the PvE side. I suck at PvP and the benefits of hitting player camps seem a bit low at the moment.
---
I know what it is. And there's a variant officially called "Brotherhood Recon Rifle."
---
The way you usually do this sort of thing is, you find the problem, you add code that logs anyone exploiting the problem, you let it run unfixed for a while (honeypot mode), then you ban everyone in the log and fix the problem. Two birds, one stone, sort of thing.
---
My gatling and 50 cal say "whatevs" ;) 
---
Have you relogged
---
This is why I stick to dog food and purified water. 
---
You having a hard time reading the sarcasm tag bud?
---
Known bug that's been happening for weeks, most people have had better luck after removing and dropping all unneeded holos and notes 
---
There hasn't been one change where I've read it and been like "how is this even a thing that made it passed alpha?"  The changes/fixes are so glaringly obvious in regular gameplay that they haven't even gotten to deep-dive issues yet.
---
Speak for yourslef!
---
+karma don't know if the karma will work but thank you for the rifle!! :D
---
Two suggestions,  farm mutations to get a couple you like. then buy some to round out your build.
---
And buy from players, they sell for 500 caps ish.  And that isn't a price due to duping. Their cheap to make.
---
Whitesprings is overrun with higher level people making the mobs higher level. Not that it's a bad thing. Even if it's non-nuked and I don't go near the club house, if there is one higher level person nearby it makes all the spawns high level. i used WV Logging till about 20 then jumped around between Wes-Tek Research and Grafton Steel. Probably going to Top of the World area or Harpers Ferry next. While the Lumber Mill is good, teh otehr's I ahve mentioned have more spawns per visit.
---
Iv seen a hyena stock it’s entire head into an elephants butthole because its skins too thick to break through so this I can confirm 
---
Nope..will try that tommorow...
---
lol...hey I fucked up, got to own :)
---
War of a does have Monster Mash as a starter
---
No.  Just claim the workshop. Fixing the plant just lets you use power boxes at workshops with 100 power instead of 20. You can still use the fusion core manufacturer without it, but have to supply your own power through generators. 
---
Actually, I've gone full stupid. Yeah, looks like I've had it for a while; I hardly ever look at my Charisma perks (I just swap out Travel Agent and Hard Bargain as needed).
---
Willing to bet that's the problem. Budget is fucky ehen moving camps until you relog. Many items don't appear in stored until you do.
---
I've made a post about this before. i think they should add a charima buff for the indisputable fact that they make you cooler. then you can smoke your cigar outside the train station before selling goods
---
Whats you Bethesda name?
---
Yeah..o well its fine tho...got placed what i wanted most tho. Otherwise ill just make it smallee
---
 Nah, don't include any items that give any kind of advantage. That would be paying to level up faster and some would consider that the first step to P2W, which we need to avoid. 
---
Exclusive outfits and paint jobs perhaps. They coughs even give timed (limited availability) sub only mini quests to acquire those exclusive cosmetics. 
---
Aaaand I just saw the word “fruit” in “fruition” for the first time.
---
Fallout 76 - teaching linguistics 1 word at a time.
---
"Ignorance is bliss"
---
I don't have to admit to anything. Myself and many other people have lost items they built in their camp during the course of this game countless times, things that they grinded for for many hours to find plans for and then many other hours to find materials to build them.  
---
So people like me have zero sympathy for anyone who one day finds that their duped item is suddenly gone. 
---
Well, at least you got the caps back.  I lost all of that ammo and items I was trying to give to my alt.  Fortunately, it was just low-level 1 star items, but still... not cool.
---
I dont seem to have an issue though.
---
But I did notice stimpack needing to be used in miltiples.
---
I thought I had just graduated to supers
---
The rum that Bethesda didn't make.
---
The rum that no one ever told consumers would feature a custom glass bottle. The custom glass bottle people just assumed it would have. Because they bought a special edition liquor solely for a bottle. Which is consumer stupidity. 
---
Correct.  I have the level 1 picklock that showed up when I hit level 5.  But when I hit level 19 I thought a lvl 2 card was supposed to show up as an option (to be stacked on top of the level 1 card to give me a total of level 2), but that second card has not shown up.  I have a single picklock-related card and that is the one that I got when i hit level 5.
---
Thanks will look into that aswell..
---
I also went with six of each crop - it was a good number in FO4, to keep things manageable at each settlement. For 76, I'm thinking 10 might be better, to keep up with the purified water production. 
---
Yes and people like you will say this until they add the new content and keep adding new content which is coming. makes perfect sense to balance the game so that people don't progress through it too quickly, I really haven't had to grind that much at all.
---
the ability to catch track and ban players using exploits has actually gotten better for a lot of online games in the last few years than it used to be. must be a lot of players who haven't played online games in a while to not realize it was coming.
---
prewar money would have been cool as a currency for the vending machines
---
Ah, no. You should not assume they have no way of seeing characters from their side. What they don't have is tools for the flunkies in customer service to tweak characters safely without a lot of technical knowledge about the engine and the creation kit.
---
You can jump right through the big ones though!

Same with the December patch it largely addressed the bugs most commonly complained about by the community.
---
You'd think at the very least that taking damage while you're sitting/sleeping would jolt you up instantly but no... gotta do that slow rise. I have never gotten up out of a bed or chair that slowly in my life. It's like your character's full of lead and cold molasses.
---
And I was supposed to know that how? Of course I expected her not to cheat on me, and she gave me no reason to suspect otherwise just as FO76 gave me no reason to suspect it would be buggy unfinished garbage.

I have 3 characters now. My first is 172 I think, 2 hand melee with like 40+ points to dedicate to perk cards if I want to switch spec.
---
2nd character level 75+ is unarmed, no PA. Bloodied fist ftw (sorry ladies)
---
3rd one level 55+ was the slowest to level due to his spec. Rifle build. But as soon as I got TSE handmade, I 1shot everything. (Except some high hp monsters)
---
I did all the quests on all 3. Lvl 31 I was done with main quest on my last character. 
---
SAAAAME!
---
You’ve truly evolved to the next level my President of the Enclave.

---
Don’t thank the Bethesda name, that’s all the project managers and execs that pushed the product out unfinished, along with all the bullshit products released with 76. Thank the software developers behind the game who are being pushed harder than ever by those people, who’s soul job it is to fix the game. They and all of the “lower level” positions are fighting to fix the upper people’s mess.

To be fair, that isn't the Top Ten Worst games of 2018
---
It is Top Ten Disappointing, and a lot of people who were excited for a more traditional experience didn't get it.
---
I love this game and BGS, but I can definitely see how this game, especially in its initial launch state, were disappointed
---
lost a Nocturnal Wood Leg.  The tragedy!
---
Nah, I just have a fairly good memory for 'statistical' things, not so much things like names.  Oh, the toy rockets have aluminium too btw, and wood blocks count as painted toys for the purposes of lead, and one type of wood block is 2 wood, not just 1 for some reason lol
---
I too also love recycled voice actors and discombobulated tales of woe.
---
Supposedly theyre just ghouls wearing golf clothes. Super rare. Ive cleared white springs dozens of times and have only killed 3. I hear the quest reward is crap anyway
---
Dead Space 1,2,3- you are tasked with a mission. People talk to you, tell you what to do, and you figure out what the hell happened. Every holo tape/video tape and text log you pick up builds the world around you. Same with Isaacs journal.
---
Skyrim- you are the Dragonborn set to kill alduin. That’s the story. The story isn’t inside every book you find in the world that BUILDS THE WORLD. That’s lore.
---
Fallout 1,2,3,NV,4- you have something called a story mission. And every terminal you find with logs tells you about the world you are in and what happened to someone else’s story. That’s lore.
---
I could go on. With the red dead series, Gta, borderlands, etc. when a game does world building outside the main quests it becomes LORE. 
---
Fallout 76 may have a story of sorts, but saying you walk to a terminal and reading about what happened to Jane at a factory and why the factory is closed is not a story. That’s lore. It builds the world around you. Nothing in 76 even affects you. You can’t care about anyone cause there is nobody to care about.
---
god damn crouched dupers...
---
My issue is shes just Tiny Tina from Borderlands in Fallout 4.
---
Damn man, I was just burning them to death... that voice chat shit is creepy as hell! lol
---
I could never get that gun because she always died before I could find her. I had to add the mod to make all caravans immortal, but lost interest in the game before I got it. 
---
Yeah No Mans sky is a great example. 
---
I'm stupid thankful for the scope and quality off the updates made to that game. Super impressive 
---
&gt; More embarrassing than anything else.
---
Yeah thankfully(?) grenades mostly just tickle without heavy investment.
---
I've been looking for articles and stuff from locals like this.
---
Awesome read, /u/veingloria! 
---
Well, those drugs don't actually exist.
---
Cigs and gars do. And as stupid as it sounds, this whole teen vaping paranoia would have anyone but the tobacco companies throwing out references. Even though this is a semi-mature game, target audience definitely swings low enough to be in the 14+ range.
---
Stupid. But yeah. Wouldn't expect it to happen because I guarantee someone would bring up a point like I just made in the room and shoot it down.
---
White springs is kind of like this already, but I get what you’re saying - a traveling horse of ghouls that wander across the map would be terrifying and very fun!
---
Enclave and Order of Mysteries quest lines definitely have shortcuts with these perks but they're pretty minor.
---
Dang man, that's super cool of you but I'm PS4. It's all good though, I can live with the itch a bit longer.
---
Well, I mean anyone -can- get banned. 
---
I wouldn't expect to see anyone getting banned for that, though hopefully all banned items get deleted as well. I wouldn't go buying any.
---
They’ve always been stable for me until I come across a duper or five. The only way to find out is to try it yourself.

Cannibalism. It's the way of the future. :p
---
He travels through the tunnel? I didn't know that. 
---
It's a straight spawn / random event. the 4 or so times he has spawned there for me he has spawned he has started going north towards Grafton. In my testing I would spawn at the Grafton Train Yard and run south to that point. There are about 20/25ish random events that can happen (There could be more I got bored after about 100 sever hops) and Grahm seems to be one of the rare events. Rachel Bot, Prizebot (your a winner and your not a winner varieties), Marshall Bots, nothing, and random low level mobs are what your going to encounter the majority of the time. 
---
The email shown in the images linked from the article is referencing an Elder Scrolls Online ban, not a Fallout 76 ban.

Dog food.... I might as well become a gourmand with that attitude.

High level players have trouble completing this quest, and most people believe it's because the golfers just don't spawn past a certain level.
---
Argue with me all you want, but we shouldn't be thanking them for a damn thing. Bethesda promised a Ritz Carlton with Fallout 76 and delivered us a motel 6. The game now is just barely a basic Holiday inn Express. I'll thank them when we get what we paid for in a year or two
---
You can also find them in Lewiswburg (where I got mine ) and Grafton (according to wiki)

Too bad my toon is right handed or that would be a great upgrade :(

It's fast travel guys it's working properly how is it intended to now at least.
---
It really does amaze me how people like you get shit on, then when Bethesda tries to save face by wiping some of the shit they put on yours, you *thank* them for it.
---
I don't. Fucking. *Get* you people.
---
You wanna like the game? Go right on ahead, no one's got the right to tell you otherwise, but stop licking the tip of their dick just because they updated the walking pile of shit they developed. You sound like an abusive girlfriend.

It will never change. They'll release money makers as quickly as possible. America is the biggest whore for the cult of the new. The rest of the world suffers for it.

We don't take that shit in other countries, but we're not the consumer whore power house that the US.

They already have a new way to dupe. Didn't even take a full 24 hours before a new one was posted on youtube.

Players can craft them. I sell them from between 200-500 caps mate

Also, you have to TAKE OFF STARCHED GENES before you use the serum, or it will just be wasted

Then put it right back on, or you risk removing it

You consider a game company fighting against cheaters and exploiters with all legal avenues at their disposal "anti-consumer"?
---
I'm feel this conversation is just going to go in circles then.

When I crafted my XO1 armor it ended up at about 150% durability without armorer or power smith (I had power patcher equipped at the time).  I think it's affected by Int, but not 100% sure.

I think a lot of people don't appreciate this part of 76 nearly enough.

Definitely agree, they have listened more than most triple A developers have recently.

Some people have already been farming for hundreds of hours and never seen those great items. That's why there's a market for them. Bad game design creates this type of situation. At least in some games when you know the 3rd boss in the dungeon has a chance to drop the item you want then you can actually farm it, with this it's RNG lottery with a bunch of combinations of type and effect etc. According to 3 people who play on PC I have read now they have been getting hardly any legendaries at Whitespring. Open world games are meant to allow you to play however you want. But it seems they want to control exactly how you play. So it would be nice if they made it clear exactly how they want us to get these legendary items. Are we to nuke Whitesrping 500 times? Kill the SBQ 500 times? I'll pass.
---
Lol. No. 
---
So naive. America is the reason they'll continue to do it. The rest of us suffer because of the cult of the new worshipping consumer whore power house that is the US. 
---
Thanks for planned obsolescence, shit cars, 989 iterations of the exact same phone at a jacked up price. 
---
All the fault the US. 
---
I like my furious fish hook, hard to break and cheap to repair
---
I'm currently doing the I AM BECOME DEATH quest and I pressed the button only to get booted from the server. 
---
first off 76 sucks monkeynuts ,,,,,2nd ...were pissed cuz they can't make a game without it crashing or needing patches and  then when you complain the game still crashes an want 60 bucks back or if not more    they wouldn't even respond back ...so it like if you want band-aid games go with bethesda...if you want games that work go with other developers ..but personally kinda done with bethesda!!!  an all you that are forgiving these buttwipers ..hope that was money well spent.
---
I still don't understand why "human" NPCs are so desired with all the non-human NPCs and other intractable that are in game.
---
The setting of the game is following the footsteps of those who came before us and failed, and our journey to try and succeed. It's a new story in a popular setting and it's going outside the comfort zone to try a new method.
---
And let's all be honest, how many people have played other MMOs and speed/arrow path the quest dialog without caring what the detail is outside of "where do I go to kill/pickup/loot/guide objective"?
---
But when will I vape?
---
Duping is a very serious problem.  They can't just stop with banning dupers. They need to delete every single weapon ever duped by them. Otherwise  the game is permanently broken.
---
Occam's Razor is your friend, dude.
---
Thanks! I love figuring out game mechanics, but after the time I spent mutating fully, I wasn't willing to experiment. I really appreciate it!
---
seems like this.
---
Even in PA I have to get out of nuke zones real quick.
---
I had an idea for a horde event. Like near cranberry bog and they should call it scorched ring. We're players would be in a ring but won't be able to leave until the event was over. Like each wave would be different scorch type creatures. And the last way would be 2 to 3 scorched beasts. The ring would be similar to the cracked glowing ground at fissure sites. Either die fighting or from radiation. But a horde event would be really fun.
---
I have a level 15 instigating explosive shotgun thats pretty good. 
---
True, it's the vast majority though.  I've only a few three stars drop in normal play in close to 200 hours.  Can't guess how tiny the odds of these god roll guns are.
---
That's good to know.  Workshops seem to be ignored for the most part on any server I join.  Not exactly sure why.  At low levels they were offering great rewards for minimal effort.  Very few people actually contested you for them, very few people seem to be interested in PVP in general.
---
And early on I would just capture a workshop, but then ignore it, just taking the initial EXP bonus and items.  Occasionally go back to "Retake" the failed defend event and get another bonus.
---
Then occasionally setting up some real defenses and an extractor or two on certain ones.
---
This happened to me yesterday as well
---
ohh! I'd like one
---
I'll add you later one
---
3k each?
---
Yep, my main is a lvl 140 non-PA 2 hander melee tank.  
---
Starting over and making a support/medic build. So far it's a lot of fun.
---
Hmmm, submitting myself to a higher power...or becoming a higher power... Tough one :D
---
Don't know what to tell you. A ton of other people have found ways to enjoy the game. The fact it doesn't cater to what you like in a game makes me think you had expectations about what the release would have. Sounds more like a you problem than a game problem.
---
Consoles should just stick to singleplayers. They have a hard time with fully open maps.
---
My wife and I both play. The game gives us the opportunity to explore the nuclear wasteland together, and strengthens our relationship! We protect each other, fight together, and figure out puzzles and missions. It's great!
---
They only spawn in when higher level players aren't around, check the middle of the golf course instead of the club
---
I like this idea too. It’d be a lot of fun. 
---
how do you know this?
---
Yeah, that can happen. Did many legendaries drop for you?
---
Aren't there some dupers selling in game items for real world money?
---
Rare random items are supposed to be rare and random? 
---
Who knew?
---
This attitude you have is the actual problem that lets people justify using exploits because they feel they are entitled to things.
---
It's ok, they're getting banned anyways :)
---
The struggle of my life, man :)
---
I've only seen this issue when I server hop, some how magically that makes my character really thirsty.
---
That’s pretty damn solid! That would mean only 20 hits. 
---
Bethesda is a money hungry company. They have shown you their true colors by giving out a shit game, shitty plastic cover for rum, shitty nylon bag in which they lied to consumers and wanted to give a $5 worth atoms for forgiveness, and has a horrible micro transaction store.
---
let's
---
I'm not assuming anything I'm just saying what I've heard and seen Bethesda say to the community. It's an old engine as we all know, and they've not ever done much in any of their other games in terms of lost characters or items due to bugs etc... I'm purely basing what I said off of what I've seen which is all any of us can do. 
---
To assume they will write an algorithm to search their user base for dupers at this point is is just as foolish. I'm not saying they 100% can't or wont, I'm just saying it doesn't seem likely based on the past and current state of things.
---
Expert Lockpick is a separate, 1 point card, but can be used with Lockpick to give you a skill of 2, Master Lockpick is similar, adding the third level of skill, but not three levels of skill itself.
---
... no
---
Your logic is flawed. I got fed up with this game and I've stopped playing it. Sure, if they make it amazing, I'll come back, but that doesn't mean I'm not gone. They have to act to get me back, which is usually the point people are trying to make by complaining and quitting.
---
!remindme 2 hours
---
I like your username. 
---
I'm glad they are really trying their best to improve the game, but yeah... They're just doing their jobs.
---
Sorry to break it to you like this but...you're a feral now.
---
The Endurance perks that *should* be balanced against hunger &amp; thirst aren't well implemented.
---
With Dromedary equipped, "\[a\]ll drinks quench thirst by an additional" 25, 50, or 75 percent, depending on perk level. Likewise, with Slow Metabolizer equipped, "\[a\]ll food satisfies hunger" by the comparable additional percentages.
---
So a single food or drink item will, with these perks equipped, refill a larger portion of your hunger and thirst bars than that same item otherwise would have.
---
But that's barely useful at all, and certainly not a big enough boon to justify keeping either perk's cards equipped full-time. Shuffling them in and out "at mealtime" is a PITA, and absolutely impracticable mid-combat — which is precisely when I want to get a return on my investment of time in collecting stat foods through various bonuses. 
---
The devs should therefore tweak both of these perks, so that in addition to an improvement in the ability of a single food or drink item to re-fill your hunger or thirst bars when consumed, the *rate* at which those bars empty out again is slowed with these perks equipped. 
---
If I have Slow Metabolizer equipped, not only should that mole rat chunk fill up more of my tummy, *it should leave me better satiated* — that is, I shouldn't get hungry again as quickly if I have this perk equipped when I eat. And prepared foods — ground mole rat, for instance — should not only do a better job of filling my tummy, but should leave me satiated for even longer than the fast-food versions.
---
And while they're fixing that:
---
I'm okay with no stacking of stat bonuses for eating different foods or drinks that share the same type of bonus. But it's ridiculous that a fast-food item whose timer only lasts half as long as its prepared food analog can *overwrite* — and therefore shorten — the longer timer that was started when I consumed the prepared food.
---
I'm not sure how much I still have in terms of missions because I've actively avoided spoilers. I just stumbled upon the mayor for a day quest last week and I'm level 100+. If you're on PS4 you can group up with me and my team I'm planning to throw a SBQ hunting party this weekend anyway
---
I craft everything... I rarely find a piece of armor that could replace what I'm using outside of a rare legendary that isn't made of wood
---
I made a post yesterday about possibly adding in a high end machine to craft screws gears and springs and this guy gave this almost identical rant about how crafting them isnt the game and how you can just go on the "15 minute" run and get 30 screws
---
Yeah who would have thought that paying full retail price at release entitled people to a working game with an actual design rather than the lack of any design and every legendary has a chance to drop 99.9% legendary trash.
---
I'm a pretty big defender and fan of 76, but a lot of what you just claimed is just wrong.
---
The launch was very bad, and would love if you could list some other online games with a launch as buggy as 76's that wasn't made my a indie developer. 
---
It is dramatically more buggy and unstable than any of their releases. ESPECIALLY Fallout 4, which was their most polished release. 
---
Those are the only two points I disagree with. I have a lv. 160 and a lv. 90 and love the game but it has very real issues
---
He's not hacking, it's a bug. I get it all the time where his gunshots sounds like punches.
---
This is nothing unusual.
---
You are incorrect sir.  They knew this wasn't going to be a huge success. That's why they didn't have a sales goal.  Way before the beta was out Tod said this game will grown and change and be fixed over time. But for some reason everyone still excepted this to be something completely different that what it was said to be from the beginning. 
---

---
I didn't buy any yet, but would gladly if you have xbox one
---
I would like to see something decent get returned out of scrapped weapon, but I can see it get out of hand, since you could easily acquire a huge amount of screws from scraping pump action shotguns farmed of level 5 mobs.
---
Possible that even the 30% chance is too high.
---
I think the issue is that all items are crafted from the same components, where as in a WoW crafting system higher level needs (for example) leather dropped only by higher level mobs.
---
Personally, if I go looking for screws I go the the Charleston capital building.  There are loads of typewriters in there, a fair few desk fans and a possible power core in the basement.
---
For a game literally all about looting, it might not be broken, but it is limited to the point that it isn't fun. Something still needs to be done and Pete already said long term plans are in the works, so you can stop arguing the point, it is moot
---
4-5. Decent dB shotgun and Gatling plasma. 
---
My base says “SELL DRUGS”   “KILL PEOPLE” on the outside walls, I think it scares the scorched away
---
Stash limit is fine, some stuff just weighs way too much. See: rifles, &amp; stabilized flux. Ammo weight is already unrealistically on the low side (I've hand-humped many-a-can of 5.56, .308, and .50 cal in my day) so I won't include that as a problem, just that it also needs to be kept in mind when managing weight. I wouldn't feel so bad about dumping ammo if we could at least scrap it.
---
So because you're too shit to hit things, you destroy someone's base? 
---
I mean...alright, weird flex. 
---
I apologise for being a dick :(
---
This game got the Bandersnatch treatment. Rushed out in time for the holidays.
---
Bethesda "Must try harder next time." 
---
I want that exact rifle, if whose ever this is and is on Xbox I’ll give 2000 caps for it
---
I believe it was fixed in yesterday's patch. The bans are happening now that the hole has been filled.
---
Fallout 76 is how Todd is getting his bigger team and more money to do what he wants to do with starfield and es6.  He had to appease investors and the big wigs first. 
---
Idk, we would have seen a seething "buy back option" post from that guy immediately after. (Joke but not really /s)
---
This is the only reason I will usually come out of pacifist mode. PvP sucks, but when you ruin my PvE and others you have to pay.
---
Willing to pump some lead into these fuckers! 
---
GT: AlexAutoAxe 
---
I have not picked up any pieces. 
---
I think this all could be solved if just crushed junk was weightless in the stash and we only needed to monitor everything else in there. It would not cause more frame loss since if you have 1 or 100000 of any item in there it causes the same stability problem. the stability issues all come from the amount of unique listed items in the inventory screens, not the weight of them so I don't understand why BGS continues to not listen.
---
He just needs to stop vanishing while I'm trying to browse his wares!
---
I installed the game on day one but haven't played.  Just been busy. 
---
Everyone rips on no man's sky, but I liked the game from day one and they have made so many improvements.  I've spent 100s of hours on it.  It's been worth my money.  
---
I'm hoping Z6 will be like this.  
---
I’m looking to add talons and twisted muscles to
---
Finish my melee only ninja executioner build, can you sell to me?
---
Did you ever find these?
---
Easiest way to find out is to go to the loading dock in the back of the building. Hop on top of the bus/trailer and follow the rickety path up to the next level. The cage with PA will be directly in front of you.
---
Much easier than going in the front door and navigating that maze. 
---
Hurry to the weapons bench and the nearest lunch box lol
---
F—- that quest. 
---
tHaTs ChEaTiNg lol
---
Wow! I haven't used macros since Windows XP, sounds like it worked, brings back some memories.
---
Since deleted all the dups they have not returned so maybe it has been fixed. Will wait and see.
---
I’m sorry about the scroll bar I tried to fix it. I’m very sorry!
---
&gt;198 damage
---
 As someone who just hit level 15, thinking they're cool af now that I can use 80 damage weapons. This kinda makes me sad, but also justifes why I'm allowed to be scared of certain parts of the map. 
---
This first people blamed the weight glitches for crashing servers, then that was fixes, then they blamed the dupers. I laugh at every ignorant fool blaming the crashing on everything else except where they need to, bottom line servers have always been unstable since the beta, that's a fact.
---
Not saying it is not contributing to the issue, but it is not the sole reason for the issue either.
---
if you die from slap damage you are just bad. even tse weapons do like nothing
---
I will have to get a buddy to take me there so I don't die a horrible death 
---
I can't believe there are people out there who are okay with Bethesda releasing a game in this state. It doesn't matter if they are fixing it now. They thought it would be okay for them to release the game like this and charge people. No matter how much they fix it they still showed how greedy of a corporation they are.
---
You're the real MVP.
---
Do you expect me to talk?
---
It does like, zero damage. Twoshot Fatman with perks does ~1300 damage, TSA Handmade with perks does around 700 without adrenaljne so your Fatman is good for like, two shots from a decent gun.
---
Fatman's ate shit. They're fun to fuck around with and to blow up CAMPS and workshops with, but they're not good. Nevermind the fact the the SBQ has very hig explosion resistance.
---
I'm wishing for the VR machines/simulations, take us into different scenarios and events. We are in a simulation after all...
---
Take your upvote, ya bastard.
---
Pacifist mode and a molotov will tap all enemies in the area, then just pick up loot after the TSE are done spending ammo and resources killing the mobs. 
---
Yeah. Scrapper is garbage as it is now. Oo, one more steel or wood. Yay. So glad I spent a perk point.
---
It's a mod sold by railroad trader bots.
---
Good to know. Thanks!
---
Jokes on you I’ve been playing 250 hrs and have never seen him
---
i run the same build and haven't had any issues? invisible mobs possibly? i still get those from time to time
---
Vanilla WoW was what made me stop playing WoW.
---
My CAMP is also at this spot. I love it alot! I wish their was the running water noise effect with it though. I don't hear any running water at this location. 
---
Here is my CAMP http://imgur.com/gallery/V5OJxGH
---
You can’t thank them enough for trying to rip everyone off by releasing an unfinished game, realizing people don’t want it, and only then start to actually care... well, care somewhat (*cough* nylon bag *cough* plastic nuka rum *cough* rip-off microtransactions)
---
Really?
---
They have no respect for the player base, and it shows. 
---
Even if there is no fruit or vegetables on your crop, you can still pick from them, you don't need to wait. Unless you in a super high traffic area, it is more like NPC's will destroy your crops before players do.
---
I can't help it, but every time I see someone on Reddit using Enclave flair, I read it in President John Henry Eden's voice. 
---
You're right. Definitely less irksome than GRAFTON DAY!!!!
---
Good. Now remove all duped items from the game. 
---
Xbox 
---
I can’t resist a good told ya so when people were so certain they were right 
---
"No negligible damage," as in the damage was significant? Negligible damage would be insignificant, unnoticable which, it is against the SBQ. Fatman does shit damage. It's flashy and looks cool and is good for blowing up CAMPs, but it's a poor weapon overall.
---
TS Fatman does about ~1300 with perks, TSE Handmade dpes about 700 with perks and shoots way faster.
---
You dont even know the lack luster game that was on original release! The NEXT release overhauled the game from hell to really awesome! Buggy like you said, but still night and day different from the original release. 
---
Tesla rifle also works well for this.
---
I prefer molotovs myself though. They leave the fire aoe active for a bit.
---
If someone has one of a particular weapon, it doesn't scream "duped" regardless of where it came from. Plus a player isn't really responsible for knowing if an item they're buying is duped. If Billy buys a TSE Dragon from a player, Billy isn't responsible for finding out the player has thirty more in his stash waiting to sell to others. 
---
If someone has zillions of (a) particular item(s), that screams duped. I really don't think it would be that hard.
---
You're allowed to enjoy something that is objectively bad.
---
likewise, played solo since i got i last week and reached 60
---
It definitely does not takd 5% lol.
---
Hey, this is starting to sound fun.
---
I know the one immediately next to the vendor in the destroyed house. Where's the other? The first time I opened that one after getting Lv3 lock pick I got a plan for the death tambo and death drum at the same time. I always get good loot out of the one in the baggage area of Whitespring.
---
Show me proof
---
I'm console only, not played a PC game since the late 90's, finding out this reward for buying 76 is on PC only stings a bit.
---
if they did this it should be the 'Quality Medical Supplies' place between the mire and bog
---
Truth
---
I think I would get serious motion sickness thundering along in power armor.
---
Yeah it lasts about 1-1.5 after a nuke, this is normal. I love flux farming after a nuke. Only problem most times you can't farm hardened mass or glowing mass, but you can the rest. Had a blast yesterday that .. many times you can go to white springs and farm after .. much more pleasant, still has tones of glowing ghouls.
---
Hey will I get banned bc I knew a duper but I never attempted it I’m kinda scared. Like will people who know the rulers get banned?
---
I would imagine elder scrolls online makes them some cash. I paid for premium and still bought cosmetics all the time when I played. granted that pays for 1 persons one day salary, for my one month of play.
---
I think it's enouth for the basics but especili with trying out difrent armors ore having weapons in two varients ultracit and normal but if it's destroying Server stability i would rather worry 10m about stash than have it take 10m for my stash to be loaded 
---
I am indeed on xbox
---
Which ones did you need?
---
Must be random. I still run supa fast. 
---
&gt;Nobody cares, and we all understand you're just doing this for the karma.
---
Me too lol. I get bored at actual work in about an hour, but doing vendor runs, collecting caps and one punching ghouls can keep me satisfied for hours lol
---
All crafted item durabilities over 100% are affected by int
---
You did not, lol
---
That's the Healing Factor taking your chems xD
---
The topic is simply informing people you can be killed by it in pacifist mode even though there are a surprising number of people that think it makes you immune to attack.
---
I saw people as recently as yesterday talk about turning on the mouse to make them immune and just wanted to make sure people realized that's NOT what the mode does
---
"Board" lol.
---
If a plant breaks you can scrap and replant it for freeeee
---
I think you're absolutely right. I've been playing a lot while in a party chat and on the same fo76 team. I feel like I'm missing a lot of the lore while my party is talking over the mic because I would feel guilty telling them to shut up every other minute I find a holotape to listen to or a note to read, lol. I think I'm gonna try soloing in the near future. 
---
I agree they should add Huntington. Mostly I’m surprised they left out Wheeling, with all its old architecture and faded glory of the industrial revolution. I’m from Charleston, glad it’s in there but bummed most of it had been destroyed. Also Bethesda pls add the Mystery Hole and Tudor’s Biscuit World thx
---
I tend to agree with this
---
Nice. Thank you.
---
Do you know of a gun that could go well with the cultist theme?
---
Twisted, can do
---
No Talons iirc
---
I can picture this happening to someone who though all this, never duped.. one day he kills a legendary.  Behold, a 3 star TSE shotgun!  Boom! Crash!  Rollback.. no loot.  Because dupers.
---
I mean.. I could though. I have like 100 supers
---
Never take rank 3 of Nuclear Physics 
---
Here's an idea, what if your stash always has the weight reducing perks active if you own the cards, not just if you have them equipped?
---
Probably been suggested before but I didnt remember seeing it.
---
if only enemies on fire lit other enemies on fire right?
---
other than that no sorry
---
I found this bug as well on PC. The only fix I found was to move the CAMP system an rebuild an even then I'm not sure I got 100% of my budget back.
---
What an awesome line this is. Brilliant piece.

No, no. I always appreciate being corrected. If it had been a genuine mistake that I had been making consistently, I would have had the opportunity to correct it from then on. I view corrections as favors, not attacks. No apology needed. :)
---
I love both 76 and atlas, and i WISH beth had the activity and push that the Atlas team does. have you been watching their updates and fixes. they unlike beth worked through the entire holiday. launch was a mess but Atlas is WAY more playable in my opinion at the moment. PVE more so than pvp however. I have to give major props to the Atlas team for how hard they are grinding out fixes. Totally agree with Culling however
---
He said Bethesda is multi million dollar company, he's only wrong in that its actually multi billion , you don't have an argument here.
---
essentially your argument to OP is that a subsidiary of a multi billion dollar company faced financial problems in developing a product 
---
they're a private company so I can't look up figures on https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm
---
and their LLC's are filed in deleware and texas who both charge a fee to look up filings, and im not paying $1-20 at a chance they file annual reports that will have the info needed to prove a mundane point to some chapped ass fan boy, how about you do it and prove OP wrong
---
Can't you get banned for using mods ? Maybe this will slowly create a path for allowable modding down the road.
---
Mods aren't saved when removed in 76 (unlike FO4). So, no. :-(
---
For the T-60?
---
That would be interesting 
---
I've been noticing more crashes as well. Twice yesterday. One of them I was walking a long distance and killed a lot of enemies on the way, but the crash put me back about 15 minutes of walk time.  Didn't lose any of the loot but lost distance
---
Dr.  Noah Body.
---
Relog or rebuild an replace the entire CAMP again only fix I've found. Quite a few budget related issues since patch.
---
I was overencumbered and had 9 ghouls rushing just me. It wasnt even a tse just a regular explosive with a ghoul modifier. Its be quick or be dead and i had alot of junk on me. Besides idk where that gd scorchbeast came from either. Im just lucky i didnt die and youre concerned with xp. Its not like i can just go get wood scraps!
---
All of those games had more than "tweaks" needed. Halo and Mass Effect crashed on me all the time with DX errors because of them using depreciated code. Borderlands, afaik, still has the duplication and weapon power transfer glitches it had since like month 2, and Destiny is constantly patching leveling and material collecting exploits that take the fun out of community play. L4D was pretty solid but had huge Xbox FPS issues and all platforms at a ton of lag in disconnection issues for months until valve changed up their servers.
---
Now, I'm not shitting on any of those games. Halo and ME weren't my cup of tea, but they were still good; but they all had post launch issues and some of them still have the same issues now. My whole point is that online games releasing with major issues is par the norm. After a year the player base either goes up because of patches and new content or it dies out because the company didn't fix things.
---
&gt;How exactly is a rainbow made? How exactly does a sun set? How exactly does a posi-trac rear-end on a Plymouth work? It just does. 
---
I agree with this, you shouldn't be able to even see the bag unless you killed that person, why is this even a thing.
---
/u/batuckan1 Thank you! Thankfully, I was able to get the install working again without having to edit any files, and will have a guide posted shortly.
---
I had installed Fallout76 to a secondary drive as the install wouldn't fit on my system drive. (I accidentally corrupted the partition table on C:\, yay hackintosh), so having it on a secondary actually saved the data. That having been said, a back up would have prevented all of this, haha.

Go away and don't come back.

It's still the worst Fallout to date. I'd literally rather play Brotherhood of Steel. They can fix much of whats wrong, but the stigma will remain forever.
---
So you think a game owned by a huge corporation but made by a small studio in that corporation has access to the larger pool of money?
---
I play with Marsupial, I would be all over the walls in my house.
---
I might have some Blamco tonight.

how do u re-spec
---
When r we gonna be able to shortcut our chasis? Why isn't that a thing? I can shortcut bits of armor but not my suit.
---
Did you actually uninstall or are we still stuck with you? 
---
It’s not about weather your enjoying the game or not, or if you have experienced the same small issues as others.
---
It’s fair to say you enjoy the games, and if you compare this game to all others before, and in the games Bethesda have released since 2006? For oblivion?
---
It’s safe to say the experience has slowly become dumbed down. The launch of the game was abysmal. The communication received since launch has been sub par, and from a developer like them, it’s a massive shame that they have allowed hundreds of small things to pile up and create the car crash we see at the moment. And the only reason I moan is because moving forward, it just want amazing games, gripping storylines and memories I cherish the same way I do when I think about games like oblivion or Morrowind.
---
I currently could not give you an example of a great memory I have from fallout 4, I played it to completion and then could not be arsed to play again, no matter how many times I rebooted oblivion it was always fresh, I still play it now and it provides fresh content to find.
---
I doubt in ten years you’ll look back at fallout 76 and think wow, I would love to relive describing this game.
---
Wow this post sounds like an 10th grade circle jerk about beating a bully lol
---
Also: Speed Demon might be exactly the mutation you'd welcome, *if but only if* you've invested time in crafting food &amp; drink items that would better satisfy your hunger &amp; thirst. The benefits in combat are pretty awesome.
---

No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!!

I found a very out of the way spot for my camp and I am alone 95% of the time. I try to just be really nice and giving to anyone I see. 
---
Delete the tabs/spaces at the beginning of your paragraphs. Reddit interprets a TAB or four spaces before a line as a code block. 
---
Dont argue him, he's obviously a shill
---
That Bethesda response giving me feels [like](https://media1.tenor.com/images/d3dc3062d1c90aff98c39afd81490925/tenor.gif?itemid=12423578).
---
Or at least drop repair cost to crafting cost...  Hate it when stuff is balanced around min/max builds.
---
I'll do the exact same except I'll tend to use all 4 and get locked out for 10 secs then go straight back in. Only if its an important terminal will I then bother to use the wings that remove words
---
I'm not Xbox, and don't have what you want for T-60 lol.
---
I do however have X01 reactive plates, tesla, and jetpack.  That took around 2 weeks of hopping, for around 3 hours a day.
---
Not fun, would not recommend, don't even play the game anymore.
---
Shake it a few times?
---
The BETA existed purely to advertise the game on through Streaming. They literally did not address a single bug between BETA and launch.
---
They need to release not broken games and stop being greedy muthercrakers
---
I haven't seen any suits other than the dirty tan one.
---
Idk, glitch?
---
Well, after Level 50 you can start moving your Special Stats around to re-specialize into something else. You can also just keep gaining levels (with little to no slow down) to get the Perk Cards you'll need for your new build.
---
Hold on a second, I'll find you a link to something that might help you plan it out!
---
Because that's what the antiBethesda bandwagon wants. Lots of industry standard practices that are perfectly acceptable by other companies get hate, like the cosmetic only microtransactions and apparently banning cheaters that literally damage the servers.
---
The game is already better than Fallout 4. There I said it.
---
I just crashed on Scorchbeast Queen. Soooo yeah. Not so much Bethesda. 
---
the December patch featured a total of what 300+ fixes
---
Name one MAJOR fix that affects gameplay greatly. I mean numbers are great, but the game still plays the same if not worse, i've lost an average of 10 fps since dec patch. 
---
I dontt want major content releasing right launch, I want an actual endgame goal and activities. Hell, even Destiny 2 had more endgame content at launch. 
---
any and all weapons from FO1 till FNV (but really want the  M72 Gauss rifle )
---
It's a good idea to leave people messages! That's so awesome.
---
Hey friend I love the pics and would love to post some myself. How do you export pictures from your PS4 onto imgur??
---
Dysentery.
---
Fallout Cookbook has the recipee....
---
Did they leave a bag with some fertilizer?
---
Explosive damage
---
That's a lot of weight, lol
---
You would need to have the purifiers running to see how they increase the overall production rate.
---
Damn, my game is completely stuck on the loading screen whenever I press play, tried everything.. even waiting 2 hours.
---
I want an M1911
---
&gt; two-shot on it would make it WORSE
---
Except it doesn't—anything small enough where the accuracy penalty on the second shot would actually hurt trying to snipe a single one are probably squishy anyway and would actually help you when trying to clear mobs of those enemies and anything really spongey is probably going to be very easy to tag with the second shot more than 30% of the time at anything but the most absurd distances which barely matters since it seems the server rarely if ever spawns in enemies at most locations until you or someone else gets relatively close.
---
Spawns fairly often in the medical room of the Enclave bunker.
---
I would love to see a charcoal/wood requirement for using them and maybe lighters/matches.  
---
But I am big on the survival aspects.
---
Just Marsupial and Speed Demon 
---
Nothing is a lot of weight to me. Thats the entire point. I can carry the entire fucking game with me and not sweat
---
There's no reason anyone should ever be spending money on the atom store. Just playing the game nets more then enough atoms.
---
I saw a Legendary Grahm yesterday. Didn’t want to attack him to find out what he dropped though! (Or if he can be killed)
---
&gt;I laugh at every ignorant fool

It'll help you organize your ideal finalized build, and keep track of what you have already 👍
---
20 without perks and 20% damage is shit compared to twoshot, bloodied, antiarmor or just about anything else.
---
We have tough guy here.  This should be a good time.
---
It is it's own type of damage 
---
Just a 20 year shelf life? Nah. Blamco has a 210 year shelf life, I'll take that instead, thanks.
---
(On a serious note, 20 years? What on Earth is in it to make it last that long?).
---
you waited a whole week to gloat and couldn't even get that right.
---
first of all, PCGamer is the one that erroneously brought up the console. Eurogamer, the source, specifically says
---
&gt;As Fallout 76 is an online multiplayer game and therefore lacks console commands
---
and the original source, Mr. X's video, doesn't bring up the console either. in fact, what he says is
---
&gt;I'm not telling anyone how this is done
---
so I'm still pretty sure the console can't be enabled. second, you can access DLC Vaults through clipping, so this doesn't necessarily involve mods. Bethesda probably just forgot to remove the debug room and it's hovering somewhere under the map.
---
which brings me to my third point- as the debug room is *in the game* and there's nothing stopping players from getting into it, except a few collisions, the server thinks it's OK for anyone to be there. you still can't manipulate server-sided data no matter how hard you want this to be true.
---
like I said previously, inform yourself before making such silly posts.
---
Even in his single player review of rdr2 he said that the controls would constantly get him hurt or killed but it was funny so it's okay. Like wtf?
---
Imagine using that excuse when using fraudulent loopholes in real life.
---
Because most of that is about trying to buy gear so you don’t have to collect resources. 
---
Thanks! I had just got the plan for them so I was looking for any reason to use them haha
---
Honestly the game is good but if they held it off from release for one more year Imagine how much better it could be!!
---
SAME man. That would be perfect for me as well. Want to add me on psn, or are you more of a solo player?
---
Its explosive 
---
yeah i agree PA sucks. for a lot of reasons really. you miss out on all the legendary armors and all the cool builds tbh. the noobiest build you could do is PA melee. everybody thinks melee is the best but it's really not. don't get me wrong it's good, especially since it's the only weapon that scales with a special stat, but there are some op gun builds. and most of them ate amazing without power armor
---
Im hearing you. 
---
You can find legendary heavy combat armor and you'll just have to put the BoS mod on yourself. You can probably find it with the mod already on it but it would be even more rare.
---
You'll float too!!
---
I'm in the same boat, stuck on this annoying loading screen for hours and no luck.. I hope there's a way to fix this
---
I do agree, though i think we are the unpopular opinion
---
Thanks bruhv!
---
I'm off work all day on Tuesdays that would be awesome. Sending you a friend request 
---
MemeQueen_0
---
It equally "disgusts me" that people like you not just defend it but also put down other people's opinions of it.  
---
Get it through your head that when we give it bad reviews some of us honestly (and unbiasedly) think it is a bad game and should get a bad rating..   Talk about not being able to see things from someone else's viewpoint.
---
Oh my god you are an idiot. Do you not know there are many many many games with shared stashes across characters and many many many games allow sandboxing and character interaction? Do you fucking live under a rock or you just have some stupid justice boner and your a close minded idiot that cant see past your own fucking stupidity. 
---
Maybe a pharmacy type workshop. I'd be all for it 
---
It's almost like 'legends' aren't always good, some are bad, quite bad.  Kinda fits reality don't it with how some legends go.
---
I'd rather it be that the super amazing and awesome things be hard to get, so not every one has them.  It makes them special, so that when some one goes 'hey I found blah' people go 'oh shit, I want that, what do you want for it' and helps stimulate player interaction and an actual economy.
---
Sigh. This is why we can't have nice things......
---
It’s your mayor! Mayor for life that is! And it is......GRAFTON DAY! Every day!!!!!!! It is basically Groundhog Day here in Grafton!!
---
Finders keepers. That’s part of the game. 
---
Yeah, this game feels like a freaking Korean MMO with all the grind required to find something thats actually useful. Might be fun for people that have 24 hours per day to play but not so much for the rest.
---
Don’t you dare!
---
The kind that goes *boom*
---
And quite often they praise Bethesda for trying to fix the shit show they created in the first place.
---
Go find a safe space to cry in hero, no cares about your soft skin around here
---
This just brings to light how pathetic instanced vendor items are.. How long would it actually take a person playing the game correctly i.e. not server hopping? You could theoretically play for years checking the vendor once per log in.. And never find what you are looking for. You probably wouldn't even know it exists except by pure RNG.
---
Also Demolition Expert from Intelligence, if you wanna get serious about PVP you'll want the dmg boost from Explosive Property Weapons
---
Funny, i saw good stuff in the notes so thought I might give it a try. Glad I decided to read a bit first.
---
This is a great idea, however I would really like a general market where we could sell stuff when we aren't playing as well. It would assure the best price, quick returns, and keep the market competitive. 
---
Thanks, had to rebuild it all when I got it to make it big enough.  I like the lighting, it picks out the colours really well.
---
Yeah but there's so many challenges you can do to earn Atoms in-game. Dailies, weeklies and set challenges you can do whenever.
---
Had a turret at my camp go rogue last night and start attacking the rest of the camp.  Did you have anything to do with that?
---
In that case I'm a bit confused: armor certainly reduces the amount of explosive damage taken, though there are only 3 resistances listed for armor: ballistic, energy and radiation. Is resistance to explosive damage some sort of a hidden stat?
---
Back when duping became the thing to do, a kid one shot me at the ammo dump and messaged me saying "get rekt". I thought it was hilarious. But that's when I quit claiming workshops and put pacifist on permanently. Pvp shouldn't exist in this game it's so unbalanced and bad. 
---
At one point it only diminished the AP cost, but didn't reduce the rate or the health loss when at max (min?) thirst/hunger. According to the patch notes, it now slows down the rate of hunger/thirst gained over time, but only at night. I can't test if they removed the other effects or changed anything until it comes out on PS4.
---
This is the second time I’ve seen the restaurant food analogy about this game and I’ve got to say it’s a bit less simplistic than that. 
---
It's a chemical reaction, chemist perk will double it
---
thats hot
---
PSA: A mining helmet and pickaxe can be found at the mining memorial south of whitesprings/directly east of the uncanny caverns image on the map.
---
I love Fallout 76. But it's also the most frustrating game I have ever played!!! 
---
I don't care about minor issues, but major ones like having to start a new character after a game breaking bug and losing a heap of crafting materials have been hard to swallow. 
---
But I will persevere because I really enjoy the game and the Fallout universe. 
---
If you didnt know, for every picture you take in photo mode, a copy gets added to your capture gallery. I then go into the capture gallery and copy the desired items onto a usb stick. Then plug the usb into my laptop, send them to imgur, and post the link on reddit. You can also transfer them to a mobile device by sending the pictures to a friend, then going onto the ps messages app and saving them to your device from there. Hope that helps
---
Troll
---
And then you'll hit lvl 50+ and realize 198 damage is terrible.  
---
I use the wheel system as an alternative to alt tab move my mouse away from the game 
---
According to the other posts for this issue: either she’s a meat pile, or it takes 10 minutes to load her loot, or this isn’t a real problem and you’re making it up.
---
The Internet always has the answer
---
There is an armor mod dense and padded that reduces explosive damage. In the next update on console and they one they had on PC. They added Explosive damage reduction to the fireproof perk card.
---
Blizzard was once the exception, but alas they fall under the yoke of Activision. Where has the understanding and love gone in these decisions.
---
Someone could probably gerryrig FO76 VR by using FO4 files and some mild tweaking to certain things.
---
Every day is Grafton day.  If you want it to stop, you have to become and better person, Phil. 
---
Interesting. I play with 2 or 3 teammates and we haven't really run into the same frequency.
---
Plenty of people used to try to take workshops but now rarely do they show up for the workshop (as you mentioned).
---
One tip for your plight is to remember that SBQ isn't the only source of good equipment. Most of the griefers don't know, for example, what an AWOL Armaments event is. That's actually where I found my first exploding weapon and quite a lot of sentinel/assassin gear.
---
I mean, death should have SOME consequence, shouldn't it? Losing your junk seems pretty reasonable to me. 
---
Oh no, now I'm reading that in President John Henry Eden's voice, too. 
---
*It's your mayor. Mayor for life, that is. And it is...Grafton Day. Every day. It is...basically...Groundhog Day. Here in Grafton.* 
---
*This is President John Henry Eden, signing off.*
---
Thank you! Everyone was so busy talking About the patch no one was posting whether it was at least Running better. I may not be playing since last patch, but I still have Hope and patience 
---
You're probably thinking of workshops.  Stuff at your camp is persistent.
---
The biggest thing for me is that there's a whole lot less loading screens.
---
Same, on PS4 as well. I really hope I didn't waste time on this perk.
---
Excessive I know but some folks just ask for it.  
---
I believe in this game. I love it already, I mean obviously it compares nothing to 3/4/newvegas. But I believe it will get there someday. Look at battlefront 2, by EA. Sure fuck EA still but I cant lie, that game is super fun. And still after one of the worst game launches ever, its added Obi Wan, Geonosis, Grievous, Kessel, Ewok hunt, skins, and more coming with "plans until episode 9 releases". If EA and DICE can do it, bethesda can.
---
It’s gone.
---
It *might* be in the rarer second-star effects that are never named in fallout 76 (like damage reduction while sprinting, damage reduction while standing, AP regeneration, junk/weapon/chem&amp;food/ammo weight reduction, etc.) list, but having seen and collected many of these (400 hours into the game) I’ve never seen sprinters, nor have I seen it mentioned on  r/fo76bazaar
---
I think I did see it on a list genereted from the game files so I think it exist in the game code, just not being used. 
---
Three Dog's quest is generally only found during the main quest.  Still a side quest.  If you really want when I get home I can take a picture of the completed quest under the "side" tab.  It's just not the main quest.
---
Nope. Waste of a free fast travel. Mine is by the ammo plant and likely will not move. 
---
If I did move it, whitesprings or Watoga would be the pick.
---
I don't adore everything they do. I don't hate it.
---
I also stayed at a Holiday Inn Express last night
---
Beautiful champ.
---
Le multiplayer game, my friend :)
---
What? Doesn’t that perk double your crafted chems?
---
Yeah, there's a hidden stat. As far as I can tell it's much lower for normal armor than power armor, unless you have the Padded or Dense torso mods. You can have 400/400 normal armor and still die when a car blows up anywhere near you.
---
It's likely to be a flat percentage rather than a damage resistance.
---
The big deal about the rifle is it comes with a bunch of the mods preinstalled for the resources of the base crafted hunting rifle.
---
It still doesn't account for the complete lack of design. One boss could have a 1% chance to drop something. At least you know what to do to get it. At least you know what mob to spend your time farming. With this game it's just kill any 3 star legendary for the chance, and somebody with an explosive shotgun might just kill it before you get near it, so good job doing all that work clearing the silo solo to then lose your mobs and items because of a poorly thought out and highly limited end game content that everyone fights over like ravenous dogs.
---
Wouldn't even mind if it were a single radio per camp. Maybe be able to attach it to those speakers to give them actually use?
---
No, they ruin the game for their own personal gains.
---
To win the argument with his wife, right?
---
I reckon y’all be onna sumfin’. N I finna throw ma hat inna ring and back y’all up. 
---
Someone makes a thread like this daily. 
---
Do you honestly think whining about it is going to change someone’s behavior?
---
From what I understand of it, no. You run through the bunker to launch the nuke (i forget the name of the quest, but it's a daily). You input the information that is needed, and launch a nuke, which starts "death from above", which is just a countdown until the nuke touches down. If you nuke fissure prime, once the nuke touches down, I \*believe\* it starts "I am become death", not 100% sure on that quests name.  
---
Also, just a heads up. You said that you got the nuke code from the internet. Make sure that it's the code for the silo that you're in and the code for this week. Any failed attempts for the code will eat your nuke code.  
---
Hope that all of this helps. Have fun dropping that nuke and good luck with the queen!
---
After 10.1.2019 patch I have also seen again that many times queen or other beast won't drop any loot.
---
How many time you need to hit these enemies in nuke zone to get their loot?
---
I can link you the main quest line and you can control+f "log" 
---
Wow I was \*really\* sincerely not expecting the Lever-Action reload thing to ever get fixed
---
I have 70 cans of dog food and the Good Doggy perk. Infinite food! Now water on the other hand...
---
Sorry, forgot to /s
---
I didn’t actually think about the speakers until now. That’s a great idea. 
---
So does Star Wars Battlefront 2, that doesn’t make it a good or enjoyable game
---
Ah
---
This doesn't make any sense. To kit a new character you'll need at least 35(!!) levels to get the perks you want.
---
In the meantime, TSE weapons (especially the Gatling with Martial Artist) destroy PVE - easily getting the levels you need to respec. Unless you're running around with 20 PER and 1 STR you can't be far off and all the perks are unlocked on your higher level character - with perk packs adding additional perks for free.
---
eBay is not on the case nor do they care about things like this whatsoever. The only way they'll get taken down is by a takedown request that Bethesda individually sends regarding each item.
---
World design will never be done better than bethesda. Their worlds are just absolute fucking masterpieces.
---
Well that is interesting. Since it's the only thing missing from your test, I wonder if it's just the clean purifier that operates on its own production rate.
---
Billy gets it now. Thanks
---
Yeah, I know this. But look at PA. It DOES reduces the incoming explosive damage, and there's nothing said about  this type of damage when you look at PA stats. So: is this stat just hidden or tied to other stats or what?
---
If you look up the videos of people killing the whitesprings bots after they do their mass spawn , you can see the problem here.
---
Good thing he did otherwise he'd have Bloody Mess.
---
Yeah fair hahaha
---
The fire looks great, but I don't ever see it reducing the enemies health at all.  Thought fire would do more damage.
---
As of now, there isn't a formal clan/guild system in place. I've not really seen any roleplay going on, but I've only been playing for a few weeks and haven't had a whole lot of interaction with other players.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if there were FO76 RP communities.
---
[Steps up on a soapbox]
---
I dont get why people are so butt-hurt over $60. Are you guys so fucking poor that losing $60 is like having someone shit all over you? In my gaming career I've wasted money on lots of games. I bought RDR2 because everyone talked about how great it was, I thought it sucked. It was slow and too drawn out for me. (I'm ready for the downvotes for this blasphemy). But I'm not calling everyone that liked the game bitches with battered wife syndrome.
---
 I'm like a lot of other players, I'm well over level 100 and have done every quest, event, and daily. All I do when I log on is sell junk and farm for God tier loot that will be made irrelevant when they raise the level cap. * But I'm enjoying it.* Its a fun grind, that me and my friends do for hours almost every night. 
---
You cant say it's alright for people to like something then insult them for liking it, its hypocritical. If you dont like it then fine, go cry in the streets. But seriously, it was only $60, stop taking shit personally. 
---
They could make the stores half the size and then let you place mini camps in them, first come first serve, and have kiosks for people who don't get a store  so they can still sell.  I would love to see people able to decorate inside their little store.  Maybe put a sign up.
---
that too
---
I stopped playing after hitting level 70, and seeing all these guys taking out scorchbeast queens in a couple shots. What was the point in grinding a decent weapon? At least now my sniper character has a chance to get a decent weapon, so I’ll probably return to try and finish the endgame bike launchin’ solo. 
---
Truth be told I didn’t run into any duper’s in OCE. Didn’t run into anyone wanting to trade or RP either so dunno bout that trade off. 
---
Lol. Game works for the most part and glitches are being fixed and you don't need those legendaries to enjoy it.
---
It's ok, we get it, you're an entitled brat, congrats.
---
Fixing heavy weapons not dealing damage or healing enemies. 
---
One big one named. Made a whole class of weapons nearly unsusable. Fixed. 
---
Also, maybe your PC is just trash. But then again, this is the internet so that's impossible. I'm sure you can run. X game at x settings perfectly.

I have over 250 excess adhesive just from picking it up. Farm is just for looks now.
---
they acted in bad faith. never.
---
Thank you! I tried the pit mentioned above, and no shovel, then I ran back to the grave and a shovel was sitting right there.
---
I disagree. There needs to be a penalty to dying and this is the only thing that does give us that. 
---
Except that person is completely wrong...
---
Level locked perks, perk packs, and the exception of somehow making it this far with only 1 STR make the story nonsensical. Plus a TSE Gatling is a PVE lawnmower with no perks at all...
---
I prefer Grelka from Skyrim. She's Riften's kindest vendor!
---
Of course. I may be in the minority here, but I had very few issues I wasn't prepared to experience and still experience very few disconnects or dupers or drops in frame rate. I've still got my Day One Xbox One and I share internet with two other gamers. This edition of Fallout has been my favorite so far and I know it won't let me down when I choose to play it in whatever spare time I find. 
---
Thank you, Bethesda. I really do enjoy this game. 
---
No because the game still has significant issues that should've been fixed prior to launch.
---
Thats the fun part people forget when crying about 76 being a dumpster fire. The sheer amount of work that had to go in to some of the bug fixes BGS have been ignoring because in single player, they're more of a quirk than a bug.
---
The Austin team were given the task of making it multiplayer. They achieved that well. Now they're dealing with the issues inherent in the previous generation of games, fallout 4 and skyrim, and this will only lead to a better ES6.
---
Frankly, they are doing a great and thankless task, and I for one would not like to be in their shoes. 
---
I hope this continues until every cheater, dupper, and modder is banned. 
---
Not enough.
---
Nah it doesn't add up. Strong only became friendly when Rex told him about Shakespeare.
---
Lol if you thinking Bethesda isn’t going to abandon this game early you are out of your damn mind

Bug: Seemingly Random Inventory Drops

Platform: PC \[i5-4690k, 16GB DDR3-1600, 850 EVO drive, GTX970 4GB (latest drivers)\]

Issue (short): Random inventory items, in different categories (junk/misc/WEAPONS/aid/all of them), drop
---
Issue (long):
---
So I'm actually not having the issue, my wife has MAJOR issues. Since she doesn't really Reddit it's me doing the write up. She's in the room with me so I can actually see this happen so I'm highly confident I'm giving a good description. 
---
So here's the rub: over the past few weeks (so across the January patches) my wife has been losing her weapons. They were equipped/favorite'ed weapons. They were dropped for seemingly no reason. Initially these things happened at some unknown point and she would just find out maybe even a day later. After she lost some major weapons (3 star legendaries), and dropping parts of her power armor we started to paying way more attention. So we noticed that sometimes power armor pieces would just drop on the floor, while moving around. My wife loves to carry tons of stuff around so dropping an excavator piece gives an immediate signal that something is off. So dropping here means we actually found a bag on the ground. As we monitored more we're finding that she's dropping junk and other items as well simply walking around. It seemingly doesn't matter where/when or what server she's on for this bug to keep occurring. We've seen silver pocket watches, vampire gatling guns, ammo, gun powder and other things dropping.
---
Something we've noticed (that may or may not be related) is that there seems to be a correlation between a glitch that when she opens her pip-boy (tab) and then tries to exit (tab again) it instead opens up the level up screen. When she tabs again it brings her to the card select screen. Usually right after, or soon after that something gets dropped. 
---
So far she's lost 4 different legendary weapons, some regular weapons and an unknown amount of junk/scrap.
---
Wait, Hillbilly Hotdogs is real?

With console update the Fireproof perk card will give you 15% Explosive damage reduction up to 45% if you max out the card. It should show up under stat screen with your armor ratings if you on PC. If on console you will have to wait for patch.
---
Zero.
---
There's not even text chat (not even on PC).
---
It's true and also works with the laser Gatling. ;)
---
And that scares me more... 
---
They have no choice but to try. They either stabilize this game, or they release TES within the year, because the flop of fo76 was a **major** hit to Bethesda.
---
 They really have no choice in being complacent, here. Even with as many dumpster fires as they've set. 
---
This makes more sense, thanks!
---
So, it's not beneficial to raise energy resistance in order to find protection from explosive damage?
---
I am on PC! I just burned all my lead on 5.56, 5mm, and 10mm :/
---
You just linked the original link posted... which the ban says it's from Elder Scrolls Online, not FO76.
---
All of this is fake as fuck.
---
Yeah who needs legendaries when PvP is a one shot from a virtually invulnerable state.
---
Tod also never told us that the game would be almost unplayable at launch and still hold the $60 price tag of a finished game
---
Apparently it is hard because when I 'hold' (which, you know, requires me to push down a key) I get the grenade noise and it arms. Every time.
---
Also, stop trying to defend the inherent stupidity of binding two actions to one key. We don't lack keys, we don't lack mouse buttons in the year 2019. There's no reason to have these occupy the same key and give us no way to change that.
---
All the mkIII were bricked by the manufacturer when they released the mkIV.
---
I mean I can do the same with fo3's three dog.  I can actually show you the quest as a side quest and all you can do is show that the main questline links to a side quest?  The quest is a side quest.  It's not the main quest.  That's literally a fact.
---
Sounds like an exaggeration if anything or others were attacking at the same time.
---
I too have never lost food that I planted at my camp. I used to make a lot of vegetable starch, though lately it's just corn soup.
---
Sometimes my plants do get damaged. The repair function is bugged, consuming just as much food as it takes to repair from scratch, but if I scrap instead I get the food back 1:1 to replant.
---
I feel like moving my camp has fixed my broken food as well, placing healthy food in camp storage. But I haven't been paying close attention. I've actually noticed more than I remember planting, so there could be some bugs there.
---
The mutant stopped to savor all my bad behavior. All in a day's work for a good good neighbor!
---
Ok but why do I need to have my camp there if everyone else is? I'll just use their stash. Plus, I'm not a creative builder so I doubt y'all really want me taking up that sweet real estate with my bland brick tower lol
---
I’m running around in the the skeleton Halloween costume if that counts 
---
There are a few cultist blades in that Lucky Hole mine where you found the cultist outfit. 
---
But honestly, I'd go with a Chainsaw or buzzblade. What's more metal than that? And, it will kill a player in no time if you do it right. Everyone thinks they do no damage....but with a specific set of things, they do insane damage. 
---
the fridge idea is the best one of all i think. 
---
Malboro parent company just announced today they are ending cigarette production to start focusing on Vaping soooo in a few years cigarettes will be just a trendy fad
---
It's a vicious cycle, the good news is once you get to the point where you can kill anything easily it'll stay that way until future content / level caps on weapons potentially raise
---
It’s hidden. The same is true for poison damage protection I believe. It isn’t considered part of another type of damage resistance.
---
Its sad to see that its almost impossible to get the 1400 caps per day with purifiers. In the current state, the game only benefits dupers :/ 
---
Updating this, should someone have the same issue. Similar to /u/brknsoul's post (thanks!), I was able to get the launcher to recognize by doing the following: 
---
1.) Rename the FO76 install folder from Fallout76 to Fallout. The name is temporary and doesnt matter, but renaming the directory is crucial so nothing gets overwritten. In my case, **D:\Fallout76** was temporarily renamed **D:\Fallout**
---
2.) Open Bethesda.Net launcher, click install. Select your previous installation location. In my case, I selected **D:\**. Bethesda.net Launcher will create a new folder named **Fallout76** within the desired install directory.
---
3.) Open Task Manager and end process **BethesdaNetLauncher.exe**. This prevents the launcher from 'cleanly' stopping the download, forcing it to validate the install folder on the next launch. **Do not relaunch just yet**.
---
4.) Delete the new Fallout76 folder created by the launcher. (In my case, **D:\Fallout76**)
---
5.) Rename your original installation folder back to **Fallout76**  (**D:\Fallout** was renamed back to **D:\Fallout76**)
---
6.) Restart Bethesda.Net Launcher. Bethesda.Net Launcher will then start validation of your existing install folder.
---
This process tricks the launcher into validating your existing install directory, rather than the download it had started.
---
In my case, the launcher took a few minutes to validate the existing install. After validation, the launcher recognized my full install and even applied the most recent patch, and the game is now recognized by the launcher as normal. I also ran the 'Scan &amp; Repair' option in Game Settings after this completed, but the launcher failed to find any errors. The only caveat is you need to have the free space on your drive to start the initial download. This can be worked around if you have an external/secondary drive to backup your working install directory
---
Then his only use would be to somebody with Cannibalism
---
It’s a terrible idea for this game. They are trying to do something new. 
---
Why just take old ideas and keep doing the same?
---
These kind of economies aren’t very good. 
---
did you got it fixed? I have the same issue now... stuck in invisivle PA and pioboyless
---
How did you not expect a Bethesda game to be buggy at launch?
---
It's literally one of the things they are known for. Their open world games are big. They have bugs. 
---
Not exaggerating. Literally well known for it. 
---
Fallout 3, Oblivion, Skyrim, FO4.... All have mountains of bugs at launch. 
---
Have you been living under a rock? If so, maybe you should have done your due diligence and looked at the launch experience of their prior games before buying 76 and expecting it not to be buggy.
---
Finally someone else
---
Anyone on PS4 have it??
---
Gonna test this one out lol
---
[This google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/174gcko5FeO-RLLwvAXB55v-3up_hXCrjCp5EGqOefzM/htmlview#) does not have good news: it seems to believe you might get a plan from Signal Strength (which is a one time quest, right?) and that otherwise the Sturdy plans may be offerd by quests in the savage divide.
---
I’ll play devil’s advocate, too. 
---
In all of our wildest dreams, products are released in perfect working order. 
---
Ask any entrepreneur if it is more important to get started or wait until the conditions are perfect, and they’ll answer with the former. 
---
I know this is the wrong platform for this discussion, but knowing how the release, feedback, patch cycle works and working in software have let me enjoy the game in spite of its imperfections. 
---
There’s a paper on the subject [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220534811_Research_Note-Sell_First_Fix_Later_Impact_of_Patching_on_Software_Quality) if you’re interested. 
---
Now, can we go back to the days when we were cursing Destiny for delaying releases so they could have fewer bugs? 😂 
---
*TL;DR:* Gaming companies can’t do anything right, if you believe social media. 
---
No it is actually main quest objectives. Like you cant go to the top of the world without getting that log for the quest
---
Not as far as I can tell. I went up to 450 energy resistance and still got routinely one-shot by explosions. Padded torso mod makes a massive difference though. Dense would be even better, but the plans are extremely rare.
---
Yep. I barely hit lvl 53 and I've done all the nuke zones, main quests, and events. 
---
I could try to trudge through all the side quests but I doubt I could stay motivated. Hope they make some more content soon, preferably something challenging. 
---
People without imaginations who can't think outside the box and are used to a pay to win option I guess. 
---
Looking forward to them changing slap damage to a set small amount rather than a percentage of damage dealt to fix that.
---
I give this game a lot of shit.
---
But this I totally agree with.
---
I think a lot of people complaining about a lack of story in this game is really just complaining that it's not gently fed to them with a series of conveniently placed spoons.
---
I'm not saying the story is perfect, but it's there if you look.
---
FYI
---
Infinite loading, worse the  before patch and I still  spawn into terrain at my CAMP.
---
I've had a deathclaw labelled as a travelling merchant one time. 
---
Now if it didn't weigh over 11 lbs... My "heavy weapons" all weight 2 lbs or so with Bear Arms.
---
It’s a hot point for a lot of people it’s crazy!
---
I smoke a pack a day but I’m respectful about it (don’t litter butts, only in my own garage, etc...) but even in a video game it gets people all hot and bothered.
---
A fridge, that keeps food, and things from spoiling. I dont need a benefit of it being ice cold. just spoil slower. 
---
aside from that, just little things, different looking crafting station, i mean the weapons stations are so blah. 
---
I'm also not a potential buyer of atoms when I'm not playing. This game's long tail requires that, since it's not a subscription model.
---
As for the other, I've certainly commented that I'm not playing. I wouldn't bother making a bespoke post since it'd just be a drop in the bucket, not to mention a downvote target for those still in the honeymoon phase of the game.
---
They will only be happy when private servers arrive and they can be kings of their server.
---
yup so have i, and yet i havent seen the reactive plates since i was lower than lvl 100. im wondering when bethesda will address this issue with plans and lvls.
---
So much this. People need to learn that it's really not the devs fault, they're the ones working the long hours and putting the effort in because it's their passion. The ones fucking it are the ones pushing deadlines despite others telling them it needs more time. 
---
I understand the need to push out a product for profit, but allowing another 6 months would drastically improve their sales and quality of said product, and it just seems like the guys making those decisions aren't getting that the majority of the gaming community is *extremely fed up* with pushing sub par titles, especially at triple A prices.
---
Bethesda deserves the shit they're getting. It should've came sooner imo. They have a tendency to let modders fix their problems for them instead of putting the work in themselves but don't think that'll happen with 76 Because there's no current mod support
---
That’s gonna be badass. Trading servers and PvP servers...yes, please.
---
Every time I put on my Power Armor I join The Imperium of Man
---
IF you find a work around lmk having the exact same god damn problem on xbox
---
Yes! The radstag/tato grill quest thing?
---
First time I saw those little coleman grills in the game I was disappointed they didn't work. Surely I could stick a little wood in there :X
---
I dont think thats the solution since its not the weight that causes any issues or exploits. They could have hard fixed the duplication bugs by simply making the max mount of a piece of equipment was say 50 or 100. Its the 255+ quantity of that item that causes all these issues. Theres no logical reason to have 50+ of the same weapon you crafted.
---
My old scrap run would be roughly 1200 weight by the time I slow walked all the way back to camp and hitting the scrap all junk taking me back down to &lt;200 was such a good feeling so it is possible to play the game as intended and have that caliber of weight.
---
So its messy. From memory: They are owned by zenimax which is owned by (mediaworks?) Which is a public company.
---
So they are corporate. The wiki says an "unknown" stake of the company was bought by this group. Not really sure how it works. If its a private company or not. But imo, a company without optically clear leadership deserves no brand loyalty. 
---
We literally do not know who is calling the shots.
---
I would guess as long as youre getting sneak attacks with it at night.. Its ranged.. Yeah it should work. I can play around with it tonight to see for sure.
---
It's taking longer because they nerfed xp.  
---
Also there is no quick way.  Even Whitesprings isn't exactly quick. 
---
I heavily role play both solo and with others.
---
My characters generally have role played motivations. 
---
I have also encountered a fair number of people playing in full RP mode. 
---
Some people need to be guided for roleplay. If you've played D&amp;D though? This game is brilliant for blank canvas roleplaying.
---
Apparently I killed 9/10 but I don’t remember seeing them. 
---
My dream: they make private servers in a year and then they do the Fallout 4 VR treatment a year after that.
---
Awesome. Very insightful!
---
Yeah its the low level 9 feral ghouls, that are literally dressed as golfers. Doesnt make mention in there name though. Definitely gets harder at higher levels as you no longer spawn the feral ghouls. 
---
❤
---
&gt; I dont get why people are so butt-hurt over $60. Are you guys so fucking poor that losing $60 is like having someone shit all over you? 
---
It may amaze you but not everyone is made of money. Get the silver spoon out of your ass.
---
&gt;In my gaming career I've wasted money on lots of games.
---
Your what? Your "career"? What are you, a streamer? Nevermind, I don't give a shit. No one does.
---
&gt; I bought RDR2 because everyone talked about how great it was, I thought it sucked.
---
Oh you brave man, you. Such a hipster, so original.
---
&gt; But I'm not calling everyone that liked the game bitches with battered wife syndrome.
---
No, you're calling them welfare babies. You're not just on a soapbox, you're on a high horse.
---
&gt; You cant say it's alright for people to like something then insult them for liking it, its hypocritical. 
---
It's like you didn't even read my comment. I insulted the game, I insulted Bethesda and I insulted people defending the shit decisions, I did **NOT** insult people for liking the game.
---
I think it sucks, I think Bethesda sucks and I think anyone who likes getting shafted and praising Bethesda for fixing the mess they made sucks, but I do not think liking Fallout 76 in and of itself sucks. I liked Fallout 3, but I'm under no illusions it had a good plot or that it's mechanics were all that great. It gets shit on for good reason, but it's still fun. At least to me.
---
Do you even understand the difference?
---
I doubt it.
---
&gt; But seriously, it was only $60, stop taking shit so personally.
---
You certainly took a comment on the internet personally. Who's the hypocrite here, exactly?
---
I've tried it both ways. It's a lot faster just to use three and restart, even if it's slightly irksome to leave that last guess unused.
---
Can't believe that's where my t-60 mods went most expensive scrap ever. 😫😫😫😫😫😫😫
---
Yeah I can confirm, my gatling plasma no longer turns this into a survival scavenging game. You can actually loot enemies from all kinds of ash piles now
---
OP over here thanking McDonald's for giving him a bun 3 months later after her bought a cheeseburger. 
---
If the game lets you build a warehouse it gets kind of dumb not being able to fill it up after that. If you have a barn in real life you can store all crap in it
---
While i do like the singleplayer part, i feel a bit forced into solo play because:
---
Duping, way too many TSE OP stuff out there and this ruined trading for me. Gonna play self found only now.
---
And i really can't get into the tagging game... Why can't we just share xp in a team and share loot in a radius?
---
Well, if they traded for a duped item and received it for nothing in return, that would kinda point to them getting it buy purchasing it from a site or some such which would be in violation of the ToS iirc
---
Xbox one 
---
still unable to join teams, even cleared my local data as suggested to no avail, in process of reinstalling the god damn game again, i should not have to constantly reinstall my game because you brain dead apes can't properly design multiplayer
---
Since we know nothing about it. It may have to be at our camps and not a seperate thing. I want no new stuff till the game gas no issues. New stuff= new issues
---
His funny musings is what puts him way ahead of the rest.Was super excited to run into him. Only 3 times so far. Wish there was a more reliable way to find him.
---
It's still not the main questline.  It is a side quest.  It runs parallel to the main quest but it's still a side quest under the side tab that pretty much stops following the main quest halfway through the main quest.
---
Pretty such it's correct. I have Raider unlocked in crafting and it probably came from Mire quests.
---
Whitespring is decent with the glowing ghouls, 300-500 xp so that's nice I just don't like using it a lot since it's boring. And I've played since the beta so I know it's taking longer to level lol
---
If you check in with the Resin the raider vendor at the ski lodge near Whitespring he occasionally has MASSIVE stacks (like 40-50 Whiskey).  First time it happened I thought it was a weird hoarding player dumping inventory.  2nd time it happened I praised Alcoholic Jeebus.   I *think* he has some weird bug with his inventory that makes him prone to repeats - lord knows his weapons inventory is usually something weird like 10 boards and 7 syringers.
---
Other than that, Whitespring has a bar you can get stuff from.
---
Cant forgive! Love the game. But how they prioritize i cant forgive. People loosing armors , guns and so the bug and glitch list goes on. But betesda is mostly focused on nerfing xp and loot drops !
---
Nerfed in the next patch. 
---
Games should be complete before release? What's up with the upvotes on this post... Something seems fishy
---
If the FEV strain that was used in WV is the same that the institute had in Fallout 4 then all muties will eventually turn into behemoths if not killed
---
Go to the bog and hunt Anglers, or the Freak Show for honeyed beasts, both drop adhesive (honeyed also drop gold scraps for caps)
---
I'm probably not understanding properly, but to sort by weight on the Xbox, you press the left joystick down, L3
---
If you're on PS4 I got a 2 shot Fatman you can have some fun with
---
If we're talking buying off eBay (for real it happens), yes but I'm talking about like getting something off the bazaar subreddit. 
---
That doesn't fix anything. That has nothing to do with what I'm talking about. PvP mechanics are a joke. People get baited and tricked into getting killed and lose their junk and caps then come crying online about it. People who know how to exploit the idiotic flagging mechanics can kill others without ever being at risk themselves.
---
&gt;The way they advertised
---
Could you elaborate on this? Because I feel they advertised precisely what they delivered, bugs and all. Unless you're referring to the canvas bag, which I will admit is a bit of a bummer but hardly worth the uproar it caused (and yeah, I bought the PA edition so that did directly impact me)
---
And if it were still called BETA, they could do a full server wipe and we could all start over together...but alas, we are where we are.
---
Just wondering why do people care about fishing in games so much?
---
That killed me
---
People who care about downvotes amuse me.
---
They know that if they add cool stuff and resolve issues and you haven't been banned, you'll come back too. Bethesda can see the number of people playing and at what frequency at any time, a post on Reddit is really just about venting and making yourself feel better.
---
Sorry I liked the offline games, that's why I liked fallout. Yes I get they are trying something new and I respect that but it's just my opinion
---
Yes I know that too, I read up on it and it sucks. I'm talking about now. The present the right here. There's gotta be another place I can make trips to get some decent xp.
---
Maybe some people actually agree.   
---
Never said it wasn't.
---
Was a myth. The people that were banned were using cheat engine, or had cheat engine installed on their PC.
---
I've been saying to myself since shortly after launch that 'fast travel' is one of the worst ways to ruin this game. 
---
Agreed 
---
I got dense plan for something, don't remember what exactly. I'm using PA :)
---
Got it, thanks!
---
I doubt it since every Bethesda have is a buggy mess. Nevertheless I'm glad they're fixing it even if I'm just a little embarrassed about paying full price to preorder after the beta so I could play it when it was released.
---
If this game was in VR I would definitely agree with you.
---
too little too late. 
---
Some will say not to forgive, because forgiving enables them to keep releasing games in a shoddy state. I know first hand that corporate suits could care less if a community complains, and only considers income on the next release. I don't see any gain from dwelling on the past. Don't buy another game from that company if they don't live up to your standards, but forgive if they work hard to get the game in shape. Why not enjoy the game at that point? I don't like constant negativity, but that doesn't mean i encourage companies to bag up dog shit. I'm still unhappy about drops and xp being nerfed, but i'm waiting a reasonable amount of time to see if those things are rectified. Forgive, don't forget.
---
I don’t think anyone needs to. Just if they are interested in doing a lot of player vendoring
---
I noticed I was draining mine faster too. Usually could goof around for nearly 2 hours before "resetting" my core. At like 45 minutes I was halfway through one. Looks like I don't get to live in my PA anymore and just use it before getting into a battle.
---
💩
---
Well, we're going to have to disagree on how easy melee is, then, because I've been swarmed from all directions before and it's not just "hit once and back up".
---
Bethesda fanboys love it when master shits in their mouths. 
---
Yeah but what if it one-sho... Oh wait
---
I enjoy playing the game but it’s too frustrating. I want to believe they’re trying but I don’t subscribe to that.  They knew the bugs existed and didn’t push the game - they fell into the user base pressure because $ was already on the table.  Those preorder $$ made them rush it and it’s regrettable.
---
how nice your post gathering dislikes mmm
---
ok cool, I really believe this is the path to bring us close to private and modding servers.
---
It is completely the main questline.
---
I'll prove it too:
---
Main Quest 1 [Reclamation Day](https://gamewith.net/fallout76/article/show/1577)
---
Look at step number 6, it is to get the first log
---
Main Quest 2: [First Contact](https://gamewith.net/fallout76/article/show/1583)
---
Look at step number 5, that is the second log.
---
All of the overseer logs are necessary parts of the main quest, there may be some secondary side quest about collecting them too but they all are required for the main quest line.  I can keep going but you should get the point, but if you're so dense I will post links for all the main quests and highlight where it says to get the log
---
Hmm, I'm doing dolces right now so I'll have to try that
---
how bout now
---
Right now, one vendor left on my run
---
GT is the same, you able to join?
---
Going to have to second this. When the immersion isn't being broken by bugs, I really do love listening to holotapes while questing though. 
---
Out of curiosity, was this on pc?
---
I think they’ll do it for private servers. Something lots of people want and technically no content locked behind paywall.
---
Awesome! I am glad you found value in it. :)
---
I'm just hoping I can find an explosive weapon legit without having to grind for 5 years
---
Geezus krist this is worse then the Destiny community except they had a functioning game.
---
Too much? I was thinking also separate stash boxes for different types of items, like a weapon box, armor box, junk box, food box, drug box. Obviously with stash limits of course but something a bit easier than just shoving everything into the same place 
---
Nani shimasu ka?
---
Yea, I'm going to try to join your world, my gt is my name too.
---
Their engine is basically just the gamebryo engine (which released in 1997) [with updated graphic capabilities](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_Engine) 
---
Rip Whitepsptings, But thank you Bethesda for the bobby pin weight reduction, Legendary hunting rifles, and the rest of the great things you've implemented. 
---
They have an entire studio that dedicated to just this game. 
---
Im sure the current stash limit is set in part, to help prevent further server load issues/instability.
---
Fixes first. Enhancements/improvements later.  
---
(But yes I agree, in the future a larger stash limit would be sweet)
---
So why don't I get to loot a dead ghoul someone else kills, why does someone get to loot me when they didn't kill me. I have no issue if someone kills me legit and loots my bag, but when they don't kill me, no they shouldn't get to loot my bag just like I don't get to take loot from an enemy I didn't kill.
---
Indeed. I opened it bracing for impact but ended up pleasantly surprised and more informed than before. Good journalism does exist at times it seems. 
---
The dense/padded regular armor mod wouldn't apply while you're wearing power armor though.  There's a perk under end they just changed to now include explosive damage resistance which would work in PA.
---
Could always have it as a default option on the hotbar same as stimpaks and other meds. Could be hold left on the dpad to send a flare. You can do a similar thing in monster hunter. As for it taking at least a minute for people to load in assuming they were able to see the notification in the first place if there were to be a cost placed on it (such as 30 caps) it would reduce the reason to send it off for nothing and save it for big targets such as scorchbeasts, death claws and behemoths. And to assist in people finding it a notification could be sent over the in game radio, just a short "emergency flare detected" to get people to look at the map. 
---
I will agree I don't see this ever coming to be but its still an interesting idea but I still think that another thread had a much better idea for the flare gun, that being shooting a scorchbeast with it stuns it and forces it to land. I'd link it if I wasn't on mobile.
---
Impressive!  Well Done!
---
I got handmade rifle blueprint second try on patrol duty
---
If you go to the upper floor of whitespring theres a vendor named bubbles who sells nuka cola and with the perk nuka dark gives 3 strength, 3 endurance and 45% water. With only -1 perception. Pretty sure its the best alcohol in the game.
---
Water farm isn't as viable in 76 as it was in 4. If you're looking for easy caps, do Mothman Omelettes, I get 7/8 per with Cha 6 and eating an omelette. There are 28 to be gathered per run, 7 runs gets you enough for all the vendors for that day. Takes about 30 minutes to do all 7 and cook them. 
---
They fucked us in every step of the marketing for this game
---
Looks great! 
---
actually now that you mention it , it has always been when I'm deep in the woods . 
---
Can't join you, you are offline.
---
I'm wondering about naturally. I know people have infiltrated the dev room to get all kinds of crazy.
---
the big bridge by flatwoods has a dead radstag named brahmin on it
---
You mean the straight rip of ARK only less fun?
---
Yeah no...
---
Why would they ban them if they fixed it? I don’t believe they deserve a perma ban for this. Maybe an account scrub, delete their characters.
---
Wait you mean you're not immersed by people two-shotting the final game boss in a nuke zone
---
Why wouldn't I care about downvotes? I don't care about _karma_, but enough downvotes on a specific post will mean no one sees what I said, because reddit deprioritizes low-score stuff into oblivion.
---
Hm, feels like a waste of time to respond to you. I suspect you just have issues with needing to act and feel superior. Guess you've found your home here on reddit. Bye now.
---
So you weren't being the devils advocate.  You are just a hater of the game because it's cool to hate it lol
---
In other words, you should buy the Calibrated Shocks and then trade them to someone who wants to buy them from you.
---
Yeah i bought it right away, and i was hyped. It is a mess, but i still play it a lot. 
---
PSA: thanks for the info! \*thumbs up\*
---
Doing any of the [Area]Horde Events for a guaranteed legendary
---
If elder scrolls 6 is running on the god damned Creation Engine it's going to take an awful lot to convince me to buy it
---
Have each box have a different inventory, but they can all fill up the entire strash so you don't have to have 3 different ammo boxes because one box has a limit of 50
---
But i really think 600 is more than enough unless you're hoarding items and use 15 different weapons that you make new higher leveled versions of every 5th level
---
Or maybe I’m upset as a consumer that they charged $60 for a basically early access title
---
You are correct, but luck was never on my side. I was 2ft from her near diamonds city and the game crashed. Couldn't find her, then I found her brahmin... just the brahmin running from mutants elsewhere on the map. I was on a bridge and saw her below me, dropped down and for knocked back from a fatman explosion followed by missiles all aimed at her entourage. By the time I dealt with the raiders I couldn't find her. Found her damn brahmin though. 7 characters I played...not once. She arrived at one of my settlements. I ran to get my gun...deathclaw alpha (forgot I had that mod with added encounters). I don't know if she died. Her brahmin ran back behind a hill, then ran toward the road faster than I could ever hope to move. Couldn't keep up. Never saw her nor the brahmin again on that char...that I can remember. 
---
I didn't even want that gun at that point. It was like Eleanor from Gone in Sixty Seconds. 
---
What are you talking about? They've been releasing patches consistently since launch. 
---
PSA: you just need that TSE Pickaxe.
---
On outside me is big and green but on inside me spirit am rotting corpse monster
---
I personally agree with only a few of the criticisms on the game as I find it to be uniquely equipped with values that come from classic pc gaming and only the most atmospheric hand crafted game experiences, but I also find that there isn’t enough open opposition to the failure in the press and YouTube / streamer establishment (not small indie) to accurately and fairly report / critique. 
---
No its not. Otherwise it would just be gamebryo. 
---
Bought it for myself.. Was hoping the vendor shared plans with other players.. Guess not 
---
If they actually spent another half a year to refine the animation system, I wouldn’t be trash them so hard. Cuz after spending 600 hours playing Fallout 4, I am just so sick of the robotic and unsmooth character animations, and here comes Fallout 76 using the exactly same animation with 0 changes, it’s simply just not up to the standards to today’s game like RDR2, heck Ghost Recon Wildlands have so much better life like and vivid animations than Fallout 76, Fallout 76 animation looks lifeless and plain dumb.
---
Thanks for the info
---
They should have revival dart in the syringe rifle that would be pretty dope.
---
I think the game has a ton of story, and I also really like the way they tell it subtly.
---
But I suspect when most people complain that the game has "no story", what they really mean is that there's not much story featuring the player as the protagonist.
---
Which, to be fair, is mostly true but probably also unavoidable in a game of this sort with the boundaries they've set up.
---
Hands down favorite thing about this game is playing a holotape in the background while killing things. 
---
The quest in the sewers where people were turning into ghouls and you got to hear their final moments and death screams was harrowing in the best way. Fortunately, I didn't disconnect the whole quest. 
---
Online according to xbox
---
Broken... Your GT happen to have any spaces in it mate?
---
Supposedly there are perk changes this Monday night. Unsure on exact details 
---
As a completely solo player myself, I completely agree. I've made it to level 31 alone. I'm currently sitting at work dying to get home and play all weekend. 
---
Dense torso mod+explosion damage reduction perk. I take literally 0 damage from my own explosive weapons now
---
I totally agree with this. I also don't think Bethesdas strategy of announcing a game, with a release a few months down the line, really helped in this situation. I would have much rather have them announced 76 and released a year later in a much better state.
---
So you think they were just sitting there twiddling thumbs until they got feedback?
---
Then they magically had alot of work done and put a patch out?
---
Why does nobody know how anything works.
---
So that's where I got the Bomber Jacket from, interesting, haven't gotten any paint jobs tho.
---
I got a TSE harpoon gun that does like 2k damage w/ perks. I kerp blowing myself up.
---
"Fridges that keep items from spoiling" - That would be far too awesome. 
---
Responders, raiders, whitespring, enclave, bos, watoga, freestates.
---
Wasn't worth 60, yet it will be supported for years........what?
---
I drank two alcoholic beverages and got addicted. Wtf kind of lightweight am I??
---
Yes!  The different buildings could have different quests or events each day!  Civil center, emergency, ams. Etc!
---
I just don't see the point of not saying something because it *could* be downvoted to oblivion. If it is what you think, that really shouldn't matter.
---
I get what you're saying but will stand by my assessment that the vast majority of people who post that they're not going to play anymore or are uninstalling come back, whether the flaws they hate are fixed or not and are really just venting and looked ng for attention.
---
Looks like you're getting downvoted, but at the end of the day not having NPC's was probably not a "story" decision and more of a "we need to get this game done by when??" decision. 
---
thanks , unfortunalty i'm on pc :( 
---
I never learned Dense from scrapping. I had to buy the misnamed plan (Dense Combat Armor).
---
Stabilized I got from scrapping.
---
That's weird.
---
I rollout in my excavator PA with 2 rads a second.
---
I question why x01 has a point as it was my go to for nuke zones due to rads but it's been the same
---
Oh that's a good idea. I just deleted a few of the big .ba2 files, and when I told the launcher to install to that path it did recognize most of the game files. I'm still having to download more than the size of the files I deleted, but it's better than the whole thing. 
---
I never play out of group thanks to herd mentality and strange in numbers - we’ve never had a disconnect be just one of us, it’s always the whole server. 
---
Good find then, I had to trade for mine. Wasn't cheap.
---
Lmao gotta see a video of this 
---
On the other hand it is quite common for games to be buggy at launch and then implement hot fixes
---
This is excellent information, thank you very much for the info on AWOL Armament. My buddy just mentioned events for legendaries, I think that may be our path.  Thanks again!
---
There's nothing in the game to really facilitate it... but nothing to stop it either.
---
There is only voice communication, no text.
---
There are a plethora of costuming options.  I use a creepy mask and a clown suit and chase people with a chainsaw.
---
There is no real clan things, but a friends list can help keep everyone in contact. 
---
Team up, share rad sponge.
---
If you broadcasted that you were using exploits and knowingly impacted the servers what do you expect?
---
If you duped 2 guns quietly with a buddy, you are probably fine.
---
If you made a video or posted a picture bragging about duping, you might get banned and probably should for being stupid.
---
I'm pretty sure they're still planning on using the twenty something year old Creation Engine in it so until they dump the whole engine and not just add some more God rays to it and call it something else elder scrolls 6 will flop. Because who wants to be playing a last get game at AAA prices on next gen hardware?
---
Let's hope its not a bug.  Ninja's can just crank stuff faster.
---
Because the vocal minority is just a minority.
---
It isn't I got 150 .50 cal rounds and a .50 call machine gun
---
Yup.
---
Btw your wording is vague. Budget is the same. Size might make ppl think the circle is different.  Which isn't either
---
Sweet glad to hear it
---
You just need a wire running near the lamp. The radius is actually pretty decent. I just wire the outside walls of my base and it lights all my lamps up.
---
How many screws do you cost?
---
Bethesda did not make New Vegas.
---
Having it so the flare temporarily distracts enemies in the area could be one way to deal with this. To keep higher-level players who just don't feel like dealing with combat from abusing it, the amount/duration of aggro drawn could relate to the level difference between the character who fired the flare and the level of the nearest enemy spawn, which could A) finally make the flare gun useful, B) provide a temporary solution for the enemy level scaling issue that newer players seem to be struggling with, and C) encourage a bit more positive player interaction.
---
All of this assuming, of course, that they implement some sort of notification for other players in the area.
---
This thread got brigaded to hell and back. 
---
Or they shipped early because shipping early is considered the right way do do things today. 
---
Trolling at its finest, I approve.
---
No I'm saying the best thing and right thing to do, would be to report it to Bethesda and not hand it to those who will abuse it and will harm the game with the information, normally in the real world when exploits to a system or service is found the information is turned into the company because the company will usually be willing to pay to fix it before it does damage that can't be fixed 
---
Just run a powered wire near them. I run my wires on the outside of my walls to get good coverage for lighting and keep the inside clean looking.
---
I put over 2000 .38 ammo in there earlier. Oops.
---
Escort an unarmed player through a high level zone. Like, a scientist through the nuke silo, to collect data or something. 
---
Been playing since fallout 3 and I'm not sure what you mean. It seems to me there's still the same amount of loading screens but they're less prevalent due to the open world span between them. You still load when you get into the world, fast travel, and enter/exit buildings in 76. Hell, there's loading when you exit the world. What other loading screens did the previous titles have in addition to this?
---
Added you. brad92
---
Yep, the skeleton is there it just needed more time in the oven. 
---
Had that happening in Whitespring patch night.  I'd run across where the buss &amp; mass of robots are/used to be, and I'd get a complete lockup.  Avoided that area, worked fine.
---
By the national astronomy center. I’m there as it’s close to Silo Alpha, and there’s a junk pile.
---
The scene where they all look at Watoga from a cliff, it's epic. 
---
Budget is based on location, not your level. 
---
Well, I mean that Bethesda has acknowledged some parts of Tactics - i.e the existence of a rogue chapter of BoS around Chicago, and the fact that it had at least at a certain point in time something going for it, before devolving back. It's mentioned both in F3 in the Citadel, and in New Vegas, where Caesar mentions his scouts in the East capturing BoS scribes who didn't even know the history of their organization.
---
At the same time, there's no evidence whatsoever about all that Vault 0 and robot bs that happened in Tactics, as well as "another fraction of Master's army blah blah."
---
So there's no certainty what Bethesda considers canon from Tactics and what not.
---
Sorry, I meant to say "selling" them is best, I am aware you can't scrap those weapons. Pretty frustrating when you're randomly doing shit and complete an event and end up with the same legendary weapon that's level 20 for the 100th time. Like, what the heck is this crap, yo?
---
it's not a level 2 card - don't sort by level, just sort by the specials and under perception you will see Expert Lockpick as a 1 point level 1 card.  It's a standalone card.  For instance you can have Expert Lockpick by itself - you'd have level 1 lockpicking.  Add regular lockpick back in and you'd have level 2.  The same is true for master lockpick.
---
Choose to pick a new perk, sort until you're looking at ALL perception cards available (not the cards you already have) and it will absolutely be there.  They aren't grouped together either, so look through all of the perception cards one by one.
---
There's no bug where cards aren't appearing at the right level.
---
Another FYI, you also broke Jetpacks.
---
With marsupial and bird bones you could fly some distance by thrusting on and off in succession.
---
Now every other thrust or so propels you slightly downwards, not upwards, so it's now crap.
---
I'll have to check it out right now, thank you!
---
How do you join those? A casual faction would be great to join for the days you want some support running havoc.
---
Thanks bud, yeah I've been looking for a long time. 
---
Back in Beta they did have little radios you could build at your camp that were tuned to specific radio stations. Had welcome mats (set the spawn point for your CAMP) as well but both were removed from the final game for some reason.
---
And it's so easy to scrap and store junk, there are places to do it all over. Not to mention the portability of the camp. I do it every chance I get, which is frequently no matter what I'm doing. 
---
Yes. Me too. So many disconnects last night I gave up. 
---
PvP should be nerfed
---
it just works
---
I feel like the lack of that stuff already may be a hint that faction based content is arriving in the future.  At least that is what I am hoping for.
---
I got alcohol addiction by downing several bottles of hard alcohol, beer doesn't seem to count. If you take something and see a dopey looking vault boy on the left side of your screen, then you're high. Anything that makes you high can make you addicted.  I think I'm addicted to psycho too, but it's not listed in the effects.
---
Pretty much what I have but I swapped out the luck point above 5 and got lone wanderer for the 20% reduced damage.

---
I'm not really build a specific weapon style yet since all my perks so far are for exploration, but congrats on your kill as well!
---
Oh cool, you rock! Thanks! Just tried it!
---
That’s a bummer. I was able to rejoin twice last night to the same server, must have been just me crashing/freezing. I would always group up too but no one seems to want to, maybe because my handle is NOTaFRIEND and I look like a radiated clown in a nurses outfit 
---
We have fun. 
---
Im lvl 100+ . never did a quest solo. I follow my buddies around on quests and kill things but its not why i play. 
---
I played all the fallouts and love pvp games so ive been stoked about fo76. 
---
Sometimes i try to drive every player from the server by engaging them at their camp. 
---
I always go for claimed benches along the way, especially if the player is still on the bench. 
---
My buddy and i also like roleplaying. So we roleplay on the mics. Think of fun scenarios based on our available costumes. We will go to a camp with a player on it and improv a scenario with some choice the player can make. May lead to is giving rewards, or us smashing your camp and killing you. It all depends on what the player does. 
---
Most people server hop when we pay them a visit and start being weird on the mic tho. 
---
The way this community took to the pvp side of the game is disappointing at best. 
---
Crikey! She's a beaut!
---
For me, I'd get one screenshot screen and then it would quickly flip to another one for a split second just before it loaded me into the world. 
---
\+1, also been having a ton of disconnects when before patch it was pretty smooth.
---
Sure, then respawns after death should cost caps.
---
Deaths ONLY downside is dropping junk. And it's incredibly lenient
---
I hate when people make this argument "say what you will, but Bethesda really cares, and they're trying to make this a better game, and i love them for it". They put out an unfinished, fundementally broken game, marketed the absolute shit out of it to boost initial sales, then scammed people out of $60-$80 (country dependant) not including the special edition and deluxe packages ranging up to $250. Instead of delaying the game, to finish, and polish, they rushed for pre-Christmas, and went "ehh we'll finish it later with patches". Now you absolute suckers are thanking them, for doing what they should have done pre-launch.
---
This is like if i bought a laptop from apple, but it was missing fundamental hardware, so to make things right, piece by piece they mailed me parts of the laptop and maybe by next year my laptop will be as complete as it should have been out of the box, then i went to the forums going "ID LIKE TO THANK APPLE FOR STICKING BY ME, THEY'RE DOING THEIR BEST, AND I LOVE THEM FOR IT". 
---
NP! Thanks for the silver! happy building!
---
I have vault tech on ps4
---
Not unhappy. Anger. Frustration. The game allows people to be assholes, while my hands are tied. I like Red Dead Online pvp much better. You get the best pvp gun in the game for like $70 in game currency almost instantly. The only thing that separates you from a higher level is their perks. Some of them are very powerful but if you play smart, take cover, shoot well, you win. If somebody is an asshole in that game I can kill them again and again. In this game assholes use every trick to be assholes, clear their bounties between their friends, somehow their name turns back to white while we are having a pvp fight. It's BS.
---
You cannot fast travel while over encumbered. 
---
I still think they could have pulled the same shit as PUBG, right or wrong, and say hey here it is in beta, well be updating it and When shit breaks it’s “not our fault” but charge at a discount price. BecauSe that’s what they’re having to sell at anyways now that the public realizes it’s a broken game.
---
Nobody who paid $60 got what they paid for and Bethesda acknowledged that when they slashed the price a month after release. Have we gotten $60 worth of playtime? Arguably yes. Was all that playtime indicative of a AAA $60 game, absolutely not
---
I'm still looking for Calibrated Shocks for the T51, saw the plans at the Brotherhood vendor once and stupid me I didn't buy it.
---
I'd love it if something like Do It Yourshelf was added. 
---
&gt;definetly sjit and full with bugs , instability , boredom , loneliness and headaches
---
Are you sure you aren’t describing your real life?
---
Collected guns for wood scrap so i could cook meat.
---
A lot more buildings are open  and don't have loading screens
---
Buried with Honor and Big Game Hunter are both Toxic Valley dailies.
---
Not a dumb question at all. Set a power connector (it’s in one of the main build menus) on a wall or ceiling of your structure, then attach wire from generator to the connector. Once in place, lights inside the structure should power on. As long as you have enough juice from the generators, you’re good to go. If you have multiple generators, I like to run the wires to attach them, then run a single wire to my wall connector.
---
You know, it's really ok that your mother breastfed you until you were 12. You can stop overcompensating now.
---
Which Watoga vendor did you buy the Dense mod from, BoS/Phoenix or the Railroad Station vendor?
---
Yes. So much. We gave up last night and before this patch I hadn't had many crashes at all since beta. 
---
The damage reductions are probably multiplicative, so full Assassin + Lone Wanderer + Dodgy would be 0.6\*0.7\*0.8 = 0.336, or 66% total damage reduction. 
---
On top of that, the damage vs resistance formula is non-linear (with high damage, damage resistance is irrelevant), so if damage reduction is applied before armor then that would increase the value.
---
Unknowns:
---
1. The damage vs resistance formula is similar to Fallout 4's, but not identical. Don't have enough data to confirm it yet.
---
2. Not sure whether damage reduction is applied before or after damage resistance.
---
But in general, damage reduction should be far more useful if your resistances are already reasonably high. Flat DR buff abilities such as Scaly Skin, Barbarian and Evasive are weak after the early game.
---
Does it look good?
---
Yeah, and PVP shouldn't be hand held garbage. Let us fight for our junk?
---
Yes thank you. They've fixed a buggy if game breaking bugs and stupid decisions that would never have been released if they did any kind of QA. The game is almost exactly the same as it was when it released, just less bugs. It still has no story and nothing to keep you playing it for more than an hour or two every other week. Unless you enjoy endlessly grinding for no reason at all.
---
That being said it hasn't been that long so maybe they will put some kind of story in there *cough* NPCs *cough*. But ya at the moment replaying fallout 4 is more exciting most of the time.
---
'Robbed' somebodies stash, just to find out it was my stash.
---
Violating legitimate business practices which can result in fines/imprisonment is a little side detail to you?
---
You don't think getting a 2 dollar throwaway souvenir bag instead of the 20 dollar canvas duffle *they specifically advertised* inside of a *200* dollar collectors edition bundle for a game of seriously questionable release quality is worthy of widespread backlash?
---
Because if not, I think you really need higher standards for products you purchase.
---
5 tries in, no dice..
---
It does if you like a lot of blue and bit of gold
---
Fairly certain that's the scorch you've got there, buddy. Say goodbye to your free will and larynx.
---
*Us?...*
---
sorry, we're the BoS not the enclave.
---
The plus side of making a video instead of just reporting is that more people can see it, and make more reports,  and a step by step video is more specific, which is more helpful for Bethesda in terms of recognizing what causes the glitch and how to fix it.
---
76 hours logged and I haven't launched a nuke yet. Great game for the money. 
---
now building a nuclear device in your basement is illegal against the law and incredibly dangerous.... Now your going to want to grab your pliers first......
---
That isn't the point of the post. People should be able to loot junk dropped, but they should also be able to reclaim it
---
I agree. I believe that much of the game is very good in concept, the stricter than normal but still forgiving Respec system, the perk card system, and the return to specialization for characters is really cool; the world is lovingly designed and the story is pretty artful and presented in a unique way. 
---
I think most of the righteous criticism comes in the realm of stability and bugs. I think Bethesda did mess up by launching too soon and they definitely need to work hard putting out fixes and communicating with the community. Fortunately though, they actually are stepping up and doing right by their game. 
---
The consumerist stuff like the canvas bags and atom shop content I think are kind of neutral. I don't think either would have been a big deal without the climate of hate and the instability in the game. That being said, I am very happy they did elect to ship canvas and that atom shop prices seem to be lessening so that was sort of a silver lining  to the misdirected ire. I would have preferred that the bag and atom shop price discussions happened in a better climate though.
---
Almost every aspect of the game has been fucked up in some way (in-game bugs, launcher bugs, customer support ticket bugs, unclear/misleading marketing, nylon/canvas bag debacle, cheats/dupes, and on and on...). The game is still extremely fucked in a lot of ways and communication from Bethesda is inadequate for the depth and breadth of FO76's problems. To their credit, they are slowly improving it but when I log in I still don't know how long I can play before I will encounter a game breaking bug.
---
Long story short: it was fucked up, is currently slightly less fucked up and slowly getting better.
---
I'm taking a break and will check back in on the progress in a few months or so.
---
I can see it becoming great someday, but not any time soon.
---
Its not.
---
It's why i have perks on the side to equip so i can travel if needed.
---
Alternatively just dump crap you don't need.
---
It will get better balance, PvP is the long game, thinking any different and justifying using exploits because it needs some tweaks is silly.
---
Red Dead has its own issues that people hate so don't act like it's so much better, didn't they just announced stuff they're fixing today?
---
New games have issues, issues get fixed, people who use exploits get banned, such is life.
---
It's against the game's tos to sell caps for IRL money. Not bannable but legal action. I heard about a website that riflegaming advertised talking about where you can buy caps.
---
Well, the trapper chest piece has a backpack and bedroll, I absolutely love the aesthetic of it
---
Who cares how it will look in a year?  Seriously. Stop giving Bethesda a pass for releasing unfinished shit and NOT listening to their customers 
---
There are still issues plaguing the game .  First of which is a SERIOUS lack of content.  If you want people to play your game , then you have to actually give them something interesting TO PLAY.  Just because a handful of people enjoy a game without any major plot line , any main quest line, any relevant NPCs doesn’t mean that it should have been released in the state it’s in.
---
The game is an unfinished, rushed piece of 💩.   Why it was rushed doesn’t matter.  It was rushed .  
---
No banked levels?
---
Wow that is nuts .. at least it would of gone viral and somebody would of got a decent amount of hits.
---
It's the game telling you to go do the event, like the game is telling me to go fix up Thunder Mountain Power Plant each time I pass on the road near it. "Thunder Mountain is offline. Repeat, Thunder Mountain is offline."
---
This sub needs to be renamed to r/buyersremorse
---
(sits in a corner crying) I know your pain......
---
I'd imagine you giving them $60 for the game is thanks enough right?
---
I thought my water and food were dropping at a drastic rate, I thought maybe home body was glitched. Turned out I had parasites.
---
I named and labelled my base "CAMP DRINKALOTTAPEEPEE"...
---
Shitty alternate side: Launch flare in a car-heavy area, dude fast travels in, shoot cars, cars explode, you die and they take your shit. 
---
I got killed 4 times in Watoga today before I realized that dudes were doing it on purpose. 
---
Okay I am dense, please link where collecting all 17 overseer logs is required for the main quest.  It doesn't matter that I've literally beaten the main quest and yet completed the overseer logs quest like two weeks after.  Considering you don't need to collect like 14 or 15 of them for the main questline.  Just because it runs parallel does *not* mean it's the main questline.  You're just flat wrong.
---
Time to join the good fight.
---
\*Words from three dog\*
---
I suppose you're right. The tiniest buildings in fnv had loading in and out. I can't remember if it's the same way in 4, but if it is, then there is at least less loading for small buildings in 76. Something like the mothman museum would definitely have a loading in/out in fo3 or fnv.
---
Try the cultist outfits for your first request.  Might scratch the itch.
---
Secondly, this isn't Ark lol.  Id rather they spend more time on FO immersive content then trying to feature in content from other games. They may give tamed pets more function later, but I strongly doubt we will be jousting on Deathclaws I this game.
---
Just 2 that I can think of.  The Union uniform and the Traveling Leather Coat. 
---
Good riddance 
---
Please stop the sever crash duplicate glitches 
---
Amen to this! I feel the same way!
---
15-20 dollar microtransactions for cosmetic items in a full price game that has very little options for cosmetics otherwise is ridiculous, dude.
---
The fact that I can earn atoms in game doesn't change the fact that I'm never going to pay 15 dollars for ~1500 atoms to buy one costume. I'll just wait til I earn enough.
---
I’ve not found it, but wish someone knows a trick. It’s not an unreasonable request. Uncharted 4 had the aged paper notes, too, but you could easily press a button to display just plain text.
---
No, the “vocal minority” are fanboys like you that give Bethesda a pass for releasing a shit game then attack those of us who dare to point out that this is what they do.  EVERY TIME 
---
Railroad.
---
Same, in 300+ hours of playing and probably seeing hundreds legendary drops in nuke zones, I have never seen a weapon with the explosive buff ... which I why I am convinced that 75% of people I see using TSE weapons are duped that were bought on eBay.

I've had more than 100hrs of fun playing this game. That's way way way more than almost every other game that comes out and you are complaining. Go cry somewhere else. Even with its flaws it's far from early access. 
---
Camped too close to a spawn point and kept respawning there every time I died which meant I kept dying as there was a horde of ghouls...must have died 6 times in a short amount of time trying to get my dropped junk...
---
Have you seen the traveling leather coat anywhere? I've never seen it and hear its like crazy rare.
---
It was. Maxed strong back allowed fast travel while overencumbered.
---
Sometimes? I try everyday but strange in numbers always just suppresses all positive effects and make the negative effects ignore class freak. It's really annoying..
---
Feed the people. 
---
More like.
---
FEED THE PEOPLE GUNS AND ARMOR.
---
And everyone will laugh and die a little on inside waiting for Es6 to be released.
---
Nah, I like him. I saw one of these set up to shoot the ghouls as they spawned through the windows (with rockets even). You don't even get exp if the turrets do all the work so he's just denying other people the chance to kill things.
---
Everybody exploits something in a game. If you logged off with your power armor on it recharged. Do you think everyone said oh I will just step out of my power armor so I don't exploit this bug. Or getting 100 extra carry weight from Excavator when you log off and back on. Do you think someone who needs to fast travel won't just relog to get the carry weight? Very few people wouldn't. Almost everyone exploits. Only big bad exploits like duping will get banned, and probably not even everyone who did it.
---
Nope. Weekly 
---
It will suppress the mutations if you're not in a team. That's the bug. Put on lone wanderer instead 
---
The science scribe outfit has a mobile analyzer backpack unit.
---
Lol u must be flexible 
---
Welp
---
Far as i know, no perk allows fast travel while overencumbered. Strong back did in fallout 4, in 76 im not sure.
---
Resets on Monday each week
---
Same with the cannibalism perk, I hate trying to activate my super-wombat powers just to drop to the floor and recover ~10hp while I get stomped. 
---
I've done that.  I came across a good amount of calibrated shocks but didn't think to grab them because I use x01, pretty dumb of me.. I'll keep a look out for them.. If I find them I'll give them to you free of charge bud 
---
No, it shouldn’t.
---
You should stop being lazy and deposit it into your stash before something unfortunate happens.
---
Happens to me all the time too. Not sure if that would be considered a server issue or not.
---
Wellllllll, holy shit. And the ignorant comment of the new year goes to... THAT GUY! (&lt;this is a sardonic and judgemental reply fyi, as it appears you may have trouble distinguishing them)
---
You took that in the complete wrong direction, lol
---
I, me, literally myself, have 80 of each, then wonder why my carry weight and stash is always full
---
I have already 5 of them from different machines. 
---
Guess the pricetag of the game isn't enough? They require our thanks to do a decent job?
---
I checked the minigun and I don't think it fires faster. Fire rate doesn't change on the weapon screen and it doesn't look like it spins 30% faster. Kinda hard to tell though.
---
The fact of the matter is that it isnt greifing and yall are nuts for thinking it is. 
---
Yes im a little testy. Had surgery this week and the pills are making the Philly in my come out. Apologize for the rhetoric but i stand by my points. This subbreddit doesnt understand that this is a pvp game and pvp isnt greifing.
---
There *is* greifing: ear cancer over the mic, verbal harassment, etc. But visiting someone while they are at camp and smashing it, isnt greifing.
---
 You dont even lose anything of value when your base is destroyed.  50 wood 50 steel and 5: screws, springs  circuits. Oh no!
---
Anyone want the piece I’m on pc
---
Meh, frogs and rabbits are pretty easy. As for always hostile creatures, I would say cockroaches.
---
Boring answer: They probably white listed it after they figured out it was giving false positives.  
---
Fun answer: They are convinced that a terrorist cell is forming in the United States, but are relatively sure that young to middle age males don't even lift bro, so they do not possess nuclear arms.
---
Keep going through, its the only way to get it easily past level 40 something
---
Brotherhood Squire outfit has a backpack. I think the all the others have been listed. But there is more gear that has similar accessories.
---
Heavy Metal Chest has a bedroll or a bag on the lower back.
---
Pocketed leather armor now has a visual effect of having pouches, I think sturdy/heavy metal legs and marine legs also have pouches.
---
Keep justifying it any way you want, they're still all getting banned :)
---
Have you listened to Rose's radio show? She talks about chems and raiding a lot the only thing it's missing is music in between her segments 
---
I've been at 4 times my carry weight playing normally (that's the point when the game forces you to slow walk even if you have AP).
---
I mean, I have the full gameplay. Got better things to do than "make things up" :) 
---
Oh weird, it looks like the inside of some machinery 
---
Honestly i think Bethesda is coming to an age focused primarily on open world multiplayer. Meaning they release a somewhat functional version and then build. I've seen the same thing with tamerial online. So i expected future add on release to the game more than i do individual single player action adventure storylines.
---
The game is only going to get better.
---
I see, thanks for the response. That's pretty promising if true. Not to mention the potential of even more reduction with full blocker or even the upcoming anti explosive perk.
---
I can confirm that this is true. I really wish we would get some reasoning from Bethesda on why they did this. 
---
that's what im talking about lol dragons dont
---
Okay, I've said this a number of times already, but I'll say it again.
---
I called him a dick because:  
---
He was destroying the stuff as the guy was actively trying to build/repair it. If the guy is right there, why not talk to him?  
---
He destroyed the entire thing instead of just the turrets.  
---
He bragged about it on Reddit.
---
I didn't call him a dick because he stopped the other guy from screwing people out of xp.
---
Q
---
Only confirmed reports I’ve seen have it dropping randomly from the One of Us quest line for the enclave.  According to the ESM it should also drop randomly from Mire Events (Heart of the Swamp, Irrational Fear, It’s a Trap and Always Vigilant).  It can also apparently drop from Mire dailies but most of those are broken after the first completion.   
---
It’s worth noting that Always Vigilant tends to occur in the Savage Divide and is easy to miss when scanning for Mire events.  I cannot confirm if any of those events actually drop either coat variant (leather coat or traveling leather coat) but I’ve been grinding them lately. I’ll report back. 
---
How am I justifying it? You used a word and an absolute statement incorrectly. There's no justification. Just a true statement.
---
&gt; instead of realising it takes times to smooth things out 
---
Maybe don't release a game you're charging $60 if your game clearly isn't ready yet? Just an idea.
---
Wow that's good to know.
---
I built a second stash box when my first one was full. That didn’t work. Lol. 
---
I feel the same way, the fonts need to be in bold or something, I rarely bother with notes in game because it strains my eyes 
---
Maybe don't make junk weightless. Instead, make bulk junk weightless.  That will give another reason to actually bulk junk and it will cut down on all the junk items that you should be scraping. 
---
When I did that it was basically easy come easy go. I stored the rare stuff and just carried like 1000 steel and such. Then when it got too high (like 300 screws) I'd craft a bunch of guns that I still needed to learn mods for.
---
We read two completely different patch notes.
---
My gf got mad at a guy who was destroying our house and this bug happened to his power armor and she took all the pieces... EPIC
---
It was $60 when I preordered and it dropped twenty fucking bucks two weeks later.
---
Servers are relatively unstable, sure. But duper’s prey on the fact that high server load makes them unstable, (crafting 300 boards with a macro - what do you expect). They intentionally make the server almost crash so they can dupe. So yes, the duper’s are a huge culprit.
---
It would not make since to add more paint for the excavator armor
---
Yeah? I mean if you want an item that you're willing to pay for, I don't see whats wrong with paying for it. If anything the dupes keep them a lot more in check. There's 10+ weapons, ammo, and serums going for $6 on eBay. If we didn't have dupes they would easily be going for $100 for one weapon which would lead to a lot of buyers remorse like we saw before the duplication issues were wide spread. Even all of that not factored in, BGS could nip this in the bud by making farming of good legionaries more consistent and more common to the point where people wouldn't feel the need to exchange real money for them.
---
Or you could stop being a chump an engage into PVP?
---
I just sell all addictol because my character apparently can’t get addicted to anything 
---
Thanks!!
---
I go everywhere the the union civil war outfit 
---
IT IS THE MSQ, if one or two of them are optional that doesn't detract from the fact that the entire MSQ revolved around the logs.  They are essential to the MSQ here we go:
---
next MSQ with a log: [Final Departure](https://gamewith.net/fallout76/article/show/1607)
---
Objective 3
---
Followed by [Into The Fire](https://gamewith.net/fallout76/article/show/1612)  
---
Objective 2
---
Next is [The Missing Link](https://gamewith.net/fallout76/article/show/1629) part of objective 1, on a body
---
This literally continues all the way down, the main story is the overseer logs.  Nothing happens outside of you following her path, at all
---
Yea, like you said it's earnable. And preferentially I don't like any of the shop items anyways. The drifter outfit and hunters long coat are pretty cool but I opt to not use any outer armor and just use my heavy leather armor, which looks pretty good.
---
I do think they over shot the prices a bit due to the fact you could earn it with normal play, but actual price for something is irrelevant I think if you just don't buy.
---
&gt;EXTREMELY long animation times
---
It's like a total of 6 seconds.
---
You are like a little baby
---
Fair enough. I would prefer a private company myself as you don't get all the liberal agenda stuff and other scandals that seem to follow that kind of business. With that said corruption can be less governed with a private company I feel, depending on the leadership.   
---
From my perspective it's because this is Fallout.  Since FO3 every version has consistently released with hordes of bugs, in the case of fo3/fonv they were bad enough to corrupt saves and spawn kill critical npc's.  It's always been rough of console until first bug dlc.
---
Hayooooh!
---
Raiding camps is an easy way to rack up a bounty and summon the servers white knights, but there is a razors edge between griefing and raiding. 
---
Ideally we like to go against evenly matched players, but sometimes you gotta stir the pot to get some action going. 
---
It's a double edged sword, the overly cautious item rollback being gone means I'm gonna be logging whenever I find a good legendary, and never dropping anything except straight into the stash
---
Funny glutch
---
&gt;This doesn't make any sense. To kit a new character you'll need at least 35(!!) levels to get the perks you want.
---
Which... Is not that fair from what I already need. So why would I ever spend that time rearranging this character (and not being able to use my old build because of special points) when I could make a new character and do it in about the same amount of time? Except... I may not want to do that. Shitty place to be stuck, and simple enough to fix.
---
&gt;All the perks are unlocked on your higher level character.
---
Err... I mean yeah, once I'm in the mid 100s, if I haven't decided to swap too many special points around.
---
&gt; Perk packs blah blah
---
Out of my last *6 packs* I legitimately have gotten 2 perk cards that were not either another copy of a card I already have (many of these being 1* cards that just disappear) or garbage endurance/luck cards no one uses.
---
As I said in the last post, this whole system would work a lot better if 50% of my perk packs weren't effectively empty, and most of the rest effectively worthless.
---
Yeah my stashes in my fallout 4 plays are basically everything I see that’s not nailed down. It was a tough habit to break at first. 
---
But wouldn't the stack count as a single item? Technically?
---
Hey it’s your loss pal. If you want to hang around whitesprings all day don’t get triggered when you die and people take your shit. It’s happened to me yet I’m not crying to reddit about it.
---
Still, it's an annoying move to build turrets there so if people start making it a bad idea to build there (by destroying everything) maybe people will take the hint. If he just destroyed the turrets then the person would have probably just rebuilt them.
---
I wouldnt mind helping out. Im level 75, without nm to do in game anymore.
---
But i guess we're in different timezones. Im about to go to bed.
---
My suggestion is go through the main quest until it asks you to go to Welch. 
---
Then, stop and explore all of The Forest and Toxic Valley.
---
Then proceed to Ash Heap and explore the remainder parts until you get to Welch.
---
After this you'll be asked to go Top of the World. Stop here and explore all of Ash Heap.
---
Go to Top of the World. Avoid Whitesprings for now.
---
Explore north of Savage Divide and go to the Mire to Abbies Bunker.
---
Continue as you see fit. 
---

This is how alot of other online games are however, this one in particular crashes alot so people notice losses much more often.
---
A 10-15 minute run that gets you everything you need is not "grindly gameplay."   
---
If you can't spend 10-15 minutes getting loot, maybe this isn't your type of game.
---
Hmm thanks for the information. How did you upload an image to reddit? I see you uploaded one image and then linked the rest through imgur. When I attempt to make a post, it allows me to write text but not to post any images, videos, or links
---
Morgantown.  Mutfruit for days.
---
With greenthumb i came out with 80 or so.
---
I'd suggest nuking more to the south east of the town as those fields are full of them
---
Sorry bro. Here's a bottle of Bactine.
---
MINUS nuclear arms, you might be surprised with the kind of people you can find on Reddit lol 
---
Real backpacks with +carryweight are coming...
---
What's a loabe? I've never heard that term?
---
Looks good, better than my fenced in crafting stations.  I like when people put the figures out front so you know it's someone's base.
---
I'm interested, but is your BoS more interested in helping the resettlement of humanity across Appalachia, or conserving technology for the civilization that eventually emerges on it's own?
---
I got my two shot explosive damage resist while reload lever action, from a regular, non nuked LV 45? Ghoul there.
---
Are you saying this game needs mor dedidated wam?
---
Looks smart :) 
---
I'm not crying, it is a suggestion to improve the game contrary to what soft-handed man children like you who don't want justifiable reasons to enter into PvP would like.
---
But yeah, keep using simpleton language like "triggered" and "crying"
---
We didn't notice anything with the mini either. 
---
This can happen if you are dropping things from your inventory really fast, such as unwanted junk or ammo. I noticed that I kept dropping my chest piece when dropping junk for a friend. The thing that made it stand out even clearer was when I was dropping a bunch of stuff on a later date and it said "dropping this object will destroy it".  The only thing I had from the atom shop in my inventory was my power armor paint. If that message didn't pop up, I would have never realized I had been dropping random pieces of armor and weapons.
---
Be careful out there!
---
This other than switches and those colored square lights terminals are useless
---
Blade of Bastet, medium, 1h, it levels with you and has increased armor pen.
---
That is easy.  I think there should be weight to it so people cant change on the fly.  Cost and delay are the two weights (and very light ones) I suggested.
---
It used to, but not recently. I've never seen a legendary spawn in monster mash the last five times I played it.  Do you have to keep playing it repeatedly to spawn legendary mobs?
---
There might have been one or two threads on the subject recently.
---
There it is
---
Where did this come from?
---
I know that the amusement park and surrounding bog in the center north region has quite a bit of bloodleaf. Go for the marshier area if you target that place.
---
Getting rid of bad actors requires locating them, and locating them requires them to act badly. How else are you gonna do it?
---
I am happy to report that it does not, at least for one test.  Tested with Berserk Gat Laser. No damage change with hazmat or no clothing.  Changes with any armor. Changes just a little with shielded underarmor.
---
Atom shop mailman has a messenger bag =/
---
I'd challenge you to beat my 50 push-up time, but then I'd be starting an arms race.
---
They started off by fucking us over. Doing a sort of passable job now doesnt count as really trying. Its damage control. Youre a fool.
---
I was sold on Grahm when he talked a solid five minutes on the different shits his moo moo would take depending on what it ate.

Going to college, getting a career and living within my means eqauls me having a silver spoon in my ass? I'm okay with that. If $60 is a lot of money to you, either because you have a shit job or because of your responsibilities, then you should be smarter with your money and not buy a game until you've had a chance to judge if its *worth* your money. You should never buy anything from the luxury category unless you are sure its money well spent, unless you can afford to waste money on the chance.
---
Career as in an occupation. Occupation also means a way of spending time. I guess a dictionary would be a waste of money to you but a video game isn't. 
---
I dont see how me buying one of the hottest titles in video games makes me anymore of a hipster than you hating on the most popular game to hate since Advanced Warfare.
---
I'm not calling anyone welfare babies, where did I say that? I only said that $60 isnt a lot of money. As I said before if $60 is a lot of money to you then be smarter with your money. I worked my way through school working at Little Caesars (a pizza restaurant in case you arent familiar). I was making $8.00 an hour til I worked my way up to a shift manager where I made a whopping 9.50 an hour. I didnt always have a silver spoon in my ass.
---
You accused people of being like abused girlfriends and asked then to stop licking the tip of Bethesda's dick. That's insulting to people that like the game.
---
I clearly understand that not liking the way something is is different from not liking the people that do it. There is a phrase *dont hate the player, hate the game* Real deep concept there...
---
I did take it personally because it's people like you that are douching up our good time (See *Garfunkel &amp; Oats - This party just took a turn for the douche*) If you dont like it, play. something. else. Sorry you wasted $60, next time wait til the game has been reviewed before you buy it. In the meantime I'm gonna go rub my nipples with that crappy nylon bag they gave me while happily waiting for my replacement canvas bag.
---
Watoga high school, once you finish mayor for a day, go to this place. Ghoul farm.
---
He has so many levels

It's all in the game files. Many colours about 7 or so and two vaiants. One normal I assume and one vault-tec branded.
---
You can see for yourself.
---
There trying because they know they screwed up but even with trying there still screwing up bethesda has a whole lot of making up to do to ever regain trust of majority of there fans
---
yes when you "hold" the key it throws a grenade. thats how its supposed to work. not sure what your issue is tbh 
---
Seriously.  They took the time to make different fonts, and *all* of them are near unreadable.

I keep on top of my diseases, definitely not a disease. But good suggestion. I honestly think we might be imagining it

I consider myself a BOS loyalist and funny enough my first camp was the cliff overlooking the nukacola factory.
---
Watch out, Travis is gonna do a hit.  
---
I have a rifle build but honestly i cant really understand why people get so excited about hunting rifles. Rof and recoil is terrible. As is my handmade with +33 VATS can snipe just as good, or my explosive pipe-action.
---
The only really good stat would be a 90% reduced weight though.
---
I'd be fine with losing caps per death. PvP already does that
---
It makes the whole situation fucked up because what if some ass actually thinks Bethesda cares? But knowing that companies actively shill and influence us it makes me think anyone who creates a post like this is a shill.
---
I have seen tons of people in the Fuzzy suit on Xbox. I can only imagine the costume or the tokens were duped....

Destiny...?

They may be trying, but when I have to relog 3 - 4 times to complete 1 damn mission ... something is fucked up!
---
It’s the startup version of a game— future sell, use current revenues to build what was sold. Repeat.
---
Factions make me think of an Elite Dangerous style. You choose your faction, perform dailies/weeklies/etc and boost your faction. Possibly go to war with other factions. Maybe claim territory?
---
Question is does this effect innocent player that are getting dupe things from other players?
---
Exploring the map is my favorite thing to do in fo76. And since i know plans can be founf everywhere i look even more closely. 
---
I bought mine off Fred the mr handy in white springs :(
---
Thank you for sharing the Combat Helmets with me. I learned the recipe. I gave you a Marina Armor Helmet in return. Scrap it and you should guarantee to learn the ability to create more. +karma
---
Lol that's amazing in itself. I have only ever seen her die once and it was near Bunker Hill. She came out to fight some mutants I aggroed. I reloaded a save to bring her back. Spray n Pray was my go to gun. Felt like a renegade vigilante gangster using it. It was relatively light and pretty much put in in God Mode even without all the perks
---
I feel the same, no way am I going to drop my cash to get a "clean" version of an in game item, this is the apocalypse, nothing is clean. 
---
I do have a ton of cool things from the shop after 400+ hrs in game from doing the weekly and daily challenges and regularly checking the other categories for ones that are near completion. 
---
The one that burns my ass is the "Play for 7200 hours" being a 20 atom reward, I barely have that many hours in the rest of my Fallout games and the Elder Scrolls games combined, and if it was supposed to be 760 hours the 20 atoms is still way to low a reward.
---
I’m not putting my two guns down on the ground if you aren’t. 
---
It appears as though we are at a stalemate. 
---
Kind of funny and creative.  I'd be pissed if I fell in there and died though.
---
No need, thanks.  Lots of stuff is in the game files.  Just wondering if you had any confirmation since you seem convinced.
---
really nice :)
---
Youd have to ask our Paladin council for that. You can find them on our discord, soldier! I am just a knight. 
---
Did you not already thank them with 70 dollars?
---
If that’s the case then it should’ve been market early access, because that’s what early access developers do, they shouldn’t of charged $60 for the game
---
I used the negative responses when I first met Trashcan Carla. She would never offer to trade after that.
---
This why I have 4 characters. Some days I wanna spend whole sessions sneaking across map others I wanna blast the Queen in the face with a minigun
---
Just switch servers 
---
Strong back adds a max carry weight of 40 in fo76
---
Just have fun
---
Regardless, it is a bug/glitch. I shouldn't have to exit/re-enter/exit again and go through all those animations just to get out of a workbench.
---
Pretty dumb to downvote me. Like I said, "friendly reminder" because BGS is patching a bunch of bugs so i figured "hey, here's something that could be an easy fix"
---
B.S. they don't care and neither does YT if their making a buck!
---
Yes it is, you can’t get it yet through normal means, though. I have the Paladin BoS one and the dude who painted it for me said that the person who gave him the plans got them from a secret staff room or something along those lines.
---
Someone made an in depth guide to scout armor on this sub in the past week... im pretty sure there are no plans that you can get for scout armor, you can only buy them and the mods.
---
One of the arms on the urban version has screwed up stats, the forest version is fine.
---
Thanks! Reddit wasn't letting me post an image along with my post here which is a shame because I wanted people to see the "Country Roads Cover" and the Nuke image
---
Jump out of the server, remember his username and block the bastard 
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
I actually think they fixed the misname. I found a Dense Marine mod today. Still haven't found the combat armor though 
---
[No, none.](https://i.imgur.com/h8wG7ZJ.jpg)
---
Quit the game and get back on, you'll get a new server without that guy. 
---
Block the player and switch servers would be your best bet.
---
&gt;Also, make sure you drop Startched Genes BEFORE you dose.
---
Is this a recent change? I've drank multiple serums with Starched Genes equipped, and they work as expected.
---
Lie a whole fucking lot, release a broken game, and fix it years later?
---
Go to your map -&gt; options -&gt; game -&gt; Passive mode - Yes.  When you damage some 1 you wil not get in to pvp. You can still take some minor damage tho.
---
I'd generally agree with that sentiment, but not for this case. Microtransactions shops are an evolving idea, constantly being monitored and revised to be as efficient and profitable as possible.
---
The problem with a lot of microtransactions like this is that they have no inherent value. They can charge anything for them (many games do, elder scrolls has 100 dollar "micro"transactions). I think what we have already started to see and will continue to see is more and more things being pulled out of base game offerings and incorporated as microtransactions. How extensive and how expensive these are will always be the result of two things, in order: how much money they're making, and how much press they're getting.
---
I think negative feedback about ridiculous pricing schemes like this are necessary to keep prices in check across the board.
---
I’m not sure it ever didn’t? After the patch it reloads faster by default. 
---
&gt; Also, you have to TAKE OFF STARCHED GENES before you use the serum, or it will just be wasted
---
is this a change with the latest patch? I've drank multiple serums with Starched Genes, and they work as expected.
---
Fantastic!
---
Jesse! We gotta cook!

Mollies and a flamer have become my go-to for whitesprings

Maybe they're saying it should leave like 1/2 of ram empty in case it needs to read more textures from the HDD really fast

That's the truth! Shit you cab buy Windows licences prototype processors that are labeled not for resale by Pentium themselves so yeah good luck getting stuff pulled off Ebay.

I also like

* Vendor Bot Pheonix for his abosulte unit in fighting the workers

* Vendor Bot Wallace for his soothing voice and tax free sales

* Vendor Bot Chad because Chad
---
That would make sense. Just wish we knew a little bit more about their plans for private servers.
---
he can't kill you unless you're attacking back.. doesnt matter how high of a level he is. 
---
Yeah trying to take your money. If they were actually trying to make a good game they wouldnt have launched a half assed game where nothing works properly. 
---
Downvote me all you want but its the truth
---
Hell yes!
---
Could the PS4 get some kind of report function? I've had level 100+ griefers just go to my home and just sit there destroying everything I own until I jumped servers, the ps4 offers no way to report players for being griefers or anything else so it would have been nice to be able to report them through the game at least.
---
You should strive to become better at trolling. Try with some original material. You can do it. Think for yourself and come up with some banger sentences.  
---
Try again, I'll rate it for you.
---
When the area is NOT nuked, are the enemies a lower level? For example... would I get my ass handed to me at level 19?
---
&gt; Wheee!

* Vault dweller who's on your lawn, old man
---
I got the marine Stabilized mod from scrapping. The way scrapping works, the last few mods are extremely difficult to get, and you just have to keep spamming and hoping. Took me \~100 arms to get Padded for metal armor, for example. Really tough for marine because they're so expensive.
---
The mod is named correctly and is also sold at Watoga, but the plan is named Plan: Dense Combat Armor.
---
That happened to me once also. I think it turned hostile after a while if I remember correctly.
---
If you go to the settings menu you can set yourself to passive mode ... you can’t do any damage to other players and they can only do minimal damage to you ... you can also block the dude from the social window.  Sorry you’re having a tough time with this guy ... most players I’ve found to be pretty cool ... you might want to try and team up with someone for white springs ... at level 17 you’re probably seen as leeching off of other player although I don’t know why anyone would care.

If I’m on at the same time look me up and I’ll grind with you ... look for Woody66
---
They only NPC in the freaking game!

Even with the nerf @-33 you should be able to grind nuke events once a day and get to Lvl 50 in 7-10 days. In the last month I raise my rifleman to 50 in 4 days but I played a lot.
---
Maybe nuke some place else other than Whitesprings then, there are a number of places with high spawn rates that you could hit that might make people think twice....like the Mire areas....fog crawlers are already tough and have high quality drops to match, perhaps 'harder' enemies when legendary drop better quality things?

&gt; if you don’t know Angry how just made a top 10 video of the most disappointing games for 2018  and it’s just mind boggling stupid 
---
Ever consider the fact that he was more excited for FO76 than Atlas, and wasn't excited for Culling 2 at all, thus why he was more disappointed with 76 than the other 2 games? This isn't the top 10 worst games of 2018 video. That's coming later. He does 3 videos for each year: Best, Worst, and Most Disappointing. It was the most disappointing for me too because I was really hyped then it turned out to be mediocre. Was it the worst game of the year? No, but I wasn't excited for any of those so I wasn't disappointed. 
---
I have no blueprints though 
---
Legit Bandersnatch situation 
---
It's a room that Bethesda uses to test and debug items in-game directly. They're in every one of their games. 76's room however can't be accessed unless the id has been datamined using cheat engine.
---
it's happened to me each of the last 4 times I've played.   
---
given that you also lose whatever workshop you've captured without any compensation, it's making a semi-directionless game feel even more directionless.   
---
let's hope they fix it soon. If not I'll just quit for a few months. 
---
Crap didn’t see someone replied, you still on?
---
I get my auto handmade usually around 2k and my dragon I’ve been getting around 10k
---
Oh ok
---
Actually I just put all the images in an album on imgur. I guess reddit does that on its own. I think this sub might be in text only
---
yeah there's no need to even get them anymore
---
Just today I got the barn plans from a workshop I took over just to mess around
---
Fair point, I’m not arguing what they should’ve done.
---
People paid it, though. And people are still playing because it’s good enough. 
---
what can the market bare? Charge that price, build what was sold while some churn out and the majority stick around because they believe in the vision that was sold. Literally the same way startups are built.
---
The finger thing means the money 
---
That is exactly how ban waves occur, set them up and then knock the shit outta them.
---
Nothing wrong with that. If you wanna do it faster you have to kill stuff.
---
Sure did. Nuclear desert. Braces as we all know, their is no desert in WV
---
Set up a camp in the middle of toxic valley at level 11. 
---
On his scale, 5 is an average game. Do you actually want to argue that fallout 76 isn't a below average game? Because I don't think that's true. 
---
This patch is balls! Freezing screen is back! Weapons heal! WTF the game has gotten worse with every patch. Its like someone's adding crap to a good soup, leave it alone already!!!
---
Me and my friends do this just to see what plans we get 
---
Thank you!!  I did that. What is the purpose of pvp anyways?
---
So am you need now is access by doing the enclave stuff then you can launch nukes using the codes from the websites
---
General Kenobi, you are a dead one!
---
I mean at the very least it is objectively flawed if you don't want to use the word bad. 
---
PS4 - This happens to me on occasion when I take out or put something in my stash. I get the blue screen almost immediately after the first item I swap in/out. 
---
Great, was kiting and fighting a boss mob and right before it died I just crashed to desktop, NO errors, just exited right out, great =|
---
Go listen to Todd at E3. "New landscape technology". Its a reash from fallout 4 ffs. It even looks worse than fallout 4.
---
They advertised it as being a fully functional online multiplayer game. What we got was far from functional. It was a work in progress, beta state game. 
---
The canvas bag hardly worth the uproar? Its false advertising! Cheating people is ok now?
---
I bought the game and im playing it, but im also highly critic of the whole thing. I hope bethesda comes around for TES and starfield.
---
I have a lot of ideas.
---
It would be cool to use the in-game lore.  For instance I came upon a firewatch tower with a note about a lost dog named Rufus.  I followed subtle clues in the firewatch tower and it led me to a different part of the map where I found the body of Rufus and his master.  The mission could be to go to the firewatch tower and 'find the pet'.  They must report back with a screenshot of the dog corpse.  I made a whole post about that trail of discovery.  Are you thinking of having actors?  Like wait till a 'villain' alt is online hiding in a spot, your guy needs to track him down and kill him, bring back a specific piece of junk he carries.
---
306 😳
---
I'll keep farming, crafting, and scrapping and just keep hoping I get it. Thanks for the hope! +karma
---
On his scale, 5/10 is an average game. Fallout 76 is not above average. 
---
How can you have only 60 fps on a 1440p monitor? Those monitors usually come ar 144hz/165hz. Afe you by any chance using a hdmi cable instead of display port?
---
Mind telling me what your build is mutations perks etc
---
Ah shit I don't have enough for barely just one nevwrmind thanks though
---
What the hell do you want a set of each power armor or something! Seriously though the weight limit sucks! I have dropped so much good stuff because of it...
---
This would be physically impossible now because of what was said the game saves inventory even on a crash.
---
Damn that’s crazy. Cause all my friends and I have been on the Fallout craze since Fallout 3. This was the game I was waiting for. Co-op Fallout was something I was dying to have for years. 
---
It needs to be. 
---
Like what I would love to know them 
---
Well it’ll be either that, or milk it to death like they did with Skyrim by making unnecessary copies on every platform imaginable.
---
Many years? I guarantee you less than 3. 2 if we're lucky.
---
Thank you. I'll keep looking. +karma
---
I do too, but eso and lots of open world games like this have non-cosmetic purchases ranging from xp boosts all the way to top level items or even characters. So for now we'll have to see if Bethesda makes the store more worthwhile or not. As it is now, I wouldn't put money into it until the game became fully fleshed and/or we got our first big free expansion. 
---
Can't argue with that! 
---
yeh but, you may have grinded.  You may have grinded a lot even.  but you'll never have grinded more :P
---
looks like another player settlement. it's not a reflection.. it's a window into a player settlement in another dimension
---
They broke the game!
---
Honestly I just wanted the lead deposit because I accidentally put my ammo into the "feed the people" event ((my own fault since I knew it was possible and still clicked to fast)) and wanted to rebulk up.on ammo it was a nice addition though. I'm planning on running around and taking more workshops no yo see what else I'll get

---
Okay let's go through these.  To start, apparently the whitespring bunker doesn't exist because there wasn't an overseer log isn't there.  It also doesn't matter that she didn't gain full entry to Free States or Fort Defiance because apparently the fact that she was there devalued the completely different things you did there.  I don't even think I ever visited Glassed Caverns to track down Taggerdy, it was all a dream!  Although the first quest in your list requires you to listen to her log (I did say you have to listen to two or three) the second MAIN QUEST it is not required to follow that SIDE QUEST although you can if you WANT TO (caps are to indicate clues that the not required quest under the "side" tab is a side quest).  The overseer logs are not found on bodies, they are found in chests.  In Missing Link you can choose to do it because you're there, but it, like with Into the Fire, is OPTIONAL.  The overseer barely even scratches the surface you scratch, she is the observer of YOUR journey, evidenced by her Nuke Launch log which talks about your actions.  She never made it into any of the silos, restricted areas, or bunkers. If you honestly think her journey is the main quest I honestly think you might consider New Vegas over when you deal with Benny.
---
I'd only like this idea as a mod for the flare gun cause I just like shooting the flaregun for fun. I don't want people to always get notified whenever I use it.

Both projectiles explode 
---
I found one near the Pumpkin House. He followed me for a while and helped me fight things, but then I accidentally hit him once, and he said something like "you are not my Commander!" and started attacking me ☹️
---
Well you did say he was "number one in many top 10 worst youtubers list\[s\]" and thus you're saying he is "one of the worst youtubers" which is what SpartanNitro claimed you said. 
---
Using purified water for recipes would make sense. 
---
It was limited time sale on the atom shop
---
Not a dumb question at all! I was beyond confused when I had to do it for the first time in Fo4
---
I've completed it 3 times since the last patch and failed none. Of course thats a small sample size, but I was never able to complete it before.
---
Trying so hard in fact that they only released the canvas bag after a lawsuit
---
So hard in fact they scammed everyone on the nuka rum 
---
So hard in fact that there’s a thriving black market to compensate for how broken the game is 
---
So hard in fact they skipped steam to avoid bad reviews and the obligation to refund 
---
So hard in fact they charge up the ass for garbage ass clothes in the atom store that were free in fallout 4 
---
Am I missing anything? Anyone care to contribute?
---
Because consoles
---
Got mine from SBQ
---
They lit it on fire before they left. 
---
Hoard everything I could grab my hands on
---
Area horde?
---
Sorry im very new. Which areas can i go to at 21?
---
Someone with brains around here.
---
Yes! This patch is crap! Repeatedly  disconnected, froze up several times. Shit is nearly unplayable at times now. I have a new 1070TI and a new nice rig and am still stuggling. Why are they doing this to us... 
---
Making the game a bit more compatitive even tho  it's super broken atm. It can bring a bit of fun drama some times. But I can imagine it's quite anoying when you're low lvl.
---
I found the barn set in a tool case in the room with the PA on the bridge and then found the plans for Quantum grenades in the other container.
---
I have a 60Hz display.
---
You can buy the serum recipes from the same place that sells the serums (look under notes).
---
They are extremely rare and expensive.
---
Both, that's why shot guns are so nuts. 8 exploding pellets.
---
Sorry, poor choice of word.  The damage amount number for the weapon, does it factor in both projectiles and the explosions? 
---
Not what I'm saying, just clarifying what they said. Also, if it didnt crash the server why would anyone care? Game was fucked beforehand anyway
---
He didn't have fun. He saw many of the game systems as horribly flawed and found the technical issues incredibly frustrating. That's what his beef is. 
---
True, but I've been a junk hog in every fallout game I've played. Having to completely adjust my play style sucks
---
His scale is bogus. He can give Tetris 10/10 since the budget and world building mean nothing to him.
---
What furniture does one use make a faction based camp like the BOS? I’m trying a BOS bunker themed camp in a cave but I dunno what decor to use.
---
Happened to me at the ferry just now
---
Figures, never get anything good from her.
---
That's pretty awesome, anytime I see people asking how to get it on here it's always "go to Harper's ferry" 
---
My group is living the raider life currently. We've taken up residence around pleasant valley train station. (Best avoid that area if you're on PS4) Gotta say it's been fun as hell. 
---
This is typical night, as of late.
---
First we decide if we'll be roving or bunkering. If we rove we go around contesting others workshops. (Why build everything when someone else will do it) This normally leads to pvp action as the person tries to defend against us. If we are lucky they'll call their friends. 
---
If we decide to bunker we raid a couple camps to boost the bounty (Sorry, not sorry, level 22 guy), then we find a nice spot to set up and wait for the contestants to roll in.
---
Honestly, these little skirmishes have been some of the most fun I've had in game. Some people dip out quick. Others bring their own crew and fight like theirs lives depend on it. 
---
It's also been interesting to see the skill level of some people. I've raided a decked out level 230 in power armor and they gone down like a sack of potatoes. While one level 43 managed fight off me and another of my party. 
---
I know people get salty about losing caps, or having to rebuild, but this is part of the game. I've had people raid me back, destroying my entire camp, but it's ok because all you have to do is move your camp an inch and drop the stored items. 
---
TL:DR It's a raiders life for me! If you're ever feeling plucky swing by pleasant valley on PS4 and my raiding party will show you a good time 😉
---
Lmfaoooo 
---
Me either.
---
I’d be careful. Any time you get in a server and there’s NOBODY else in it even after you give it a while to load, it means there’s probably a crash imminent 
---
What he said!
---
Wow bro, other games have nothing to do with this one.  There is no shared storage here, you are cheating and instead of accepting it you are lashing out like a child having a temper tantrum.  Throw your toys around all you like, your still exploiting.

---
Just adding that I bet that the Bethesda lurkers really like to read these posts.  If I was (and I’m not) one of the creative peeps responsible for creating the world, it would give me great pleasure reading how much my clients are enjoying my work.   
---
Angry Joe is right though, the list was for most DISAPPOINTING games of 2018... Atlas was no where near as hyped as fo76... especially comparing a developing team size difference and company name. There are expectations to be had with a AAA release, and it didn't meet those, that's why it's disappointing, it's not saying the game is bad per say.
---
Area as in Events like Forest Horde: Scorched, For your level I'd look for ash heap ones
---
I did mention it was extremely rare.
---
God I miss that mod
---
i mean technically explosives kinda got an indirect nerf with the new fireproof perk
---
He said on his second account he picked up the stuff, then crashed, then it was gone.  So it didn't save.
---
Oh well that is cool then
---
Man, the salt flows. Sometimes you can just feel the rage through that PSN message haha.  
---
So the dream is that one game’s ban would fuck each and every game and account you have anywhere? Yeah no thanks. I’ve fallen victim to unjust bans on MMOs before, that were reversed in several days/weeks. Your idea would have me banned from every other game I own because one studio has shit for brains.
---
Ironically enough one tempban was because I had a (bought) duped endgame accessory in my possession, and the other was a bunch of assholes in the same guild falsely reporting me for harassment after PKing some of their members.
---
Your method would literally allow some asshats to destroy someone’s collection worth thousands of dollars.
---
Weird, I'm on a regular GTX 1080 and I'm getting around 90-130 fps at 1440p.
---
You wouldn’t be able to play without it, you signed it at one point or another 
---
This just in: If you arn't having fun try harder at having fun!
---
I have only a small water purifier and it's already given me all the water I'll ever need. 
---
I'm happy with twice a week. 
---
Any particular spot you'd like me to check?
---
Didn't notice the map markers in Fallout 3. So I would keep looking at the map to try to see if I was going the right way, and I got really lost trying to get to the GNR HQ. 
---
It was another 150 hours or so before I noticed that there was an indoor map view for interior spaces. 
---
Aaand another 50 hours or so before I noticed that map markers also appear on the doors you need to go through.
---
I'm guessing it was just a straight joke rather than a reference but I could be wrong.
---
Well I actually have one of each weapon for the differing bullet types cuz ammo has weight and when I’ve got too much I switch guns once one weapon he used most of my bullet types
---
This is a true story.
---
You should raise your standards as a customer 
---
Role play is all up to you but doesn't seem to be tailored to. Iirc they mentioned implementing some form of clan/guild/faction support at some point in a road map at some undisclosed future point. 
---
Just hide the ui and take a screenshot? If you Google xboxclips you can find your screenshots there 
---
It sucks but at this point, its really all we can ask for
---
Must be
---
Used to just use it and not give a mutation
---
Why do people say stupid shit like this. Obviously not all explosive weapons are duped.  
---
Lol so hold on this is another fake FO76 story going mainstream? At least this isn't a controversial one for a change.
---
I just throw them on the ground and let them despawn or make a weapon and go around shooting at everything and nothing until i am out
---
Maybe. Thanks for your suggestion. Sorry for my attitude. I really like so much about the game but some things I just don't. When it comes to a clear path to getting a certain item it's just grinding and random and that's not something I'm willing to waste even more hundreds of hours on.

I think you would like the radiation pit ive built in my camp by the bridge at Overseer's camp.. when you fall in the neon on the wall says 'Vault 76 Tests' and you have to decode the powered wall code that I have on the wall in the room before the "tester" flips the switch on the testee that fell for the trap. Gotta put those new players through their paces before really getting into things.

Happened to me earlier where the body just disappeared after a few seconds, before I could loot it 🤦
---
We could definitely use some gambling. Let's get a robotic blackjack dealer somewhere, or Texas Hold'em. That would be easy to implement.
---
This wasn’t a list on worst games of 2018, it was a list about the most disappointing games, in which it’s completely justified for Fo76 to be at the top. People had a certain expectation of a Bethesda game, and the way they marketed this game made it seem that it was the next best thing. They even went as far to say this is their biggest project to date. When the game released, it was nothing like people had hoped, and it was a broken mess to top it off. It shouldn’t be a surprise that it tops some most disappointing releases, because theres nothing more disappointing than a great video game company, that you expect greatness from, putting out an okay game at best.
---
Can you tame one for your camp?
---
You're invested.

Up vote for harpers ferry's bot. That smooth bastard.

So to clarify: the main quest requires 3 out of the 17 overseer logs and puts you in places she never went doing things she never could and involves your own story doing these things she never could and her story is the main storyline?  Just want to clarify my headcanon and how delusional I am.
---
So... why couldn’t we boil purified water? I didn’t say it had to eliminate diseases 
---
I am going to say no, dont do this. I often double my carry weight in BS weapon and armor drops trying to get mods and scrape. If anything 1000 be the cap not 100 more than my carry weight.
---
Earlier I moved my Camp and all my stored items doubled for some reason and took up all the space? 
---
I’ve got some legendaries I’d rather not lose ^ ^ no TSE’s but like vampire or lighter weight versions. One star items and the like.
---
I hit 545 picking up weapons questing and doing events this morning... let's not
---
No, those were the first 3 I highlighted going through all of them was taking quite a bit.  The main quest takes you to each overseer log with the specific purpose of having you listen to them, it is the only way for the story to have cohesion
---
I posted about this before, IIRC it would be hard to implement in Europe due to EU regulations about smoking in media.
---
Definitely. For example exploring alone that fucking Vendigo cave...
---
Yeah i don't know what my bottleneck is. I'm on i7 6700k 16 gb ddr4 at 2133hz with SSD. Guess RTX 2080 is very unoptimized.
---
Maybe twice since launch? Both times it was because I forgot I had already take a Psycho drug. Not a big deal though, I have like 15 Addictol.
---
I dont suppose PS4 can use the chat mod?  I do all my trading in the trade channel in-game.
---
Is it over? And do you wanna run another right after? I've got Keycards, just want some people (more fun in a crew lol)
---
That sounds AWESOME. Can you make a video of it? It would be great to see it in action.
---
Or, at least, an imgur album showing it off?
---
Ahahah yes! Someone with brains around here. They're even banning players for duping ffs! They have shitty servers and beta days exploits, and the solution is kicking out paying costumers... and the community applaudes them... its sad.
---
This. Yes.
---
Also thought I'd link you [this](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Overseer%27s_Mission) so you can read the category the quest is under.
---
They don't get a pass on this shit anymore.
---
Their games are getting buggier with each release, they keep reusing a 20-year old engine, and they're making their games simpler and simpler.
---
Bethesda needs to pull their shit together.
---
So if someone is sharing SIN and leaves the party, or stops sharing it, it will cause this bug. It seems to fix itself for me. 
---
He can if he has enough buffs
---
The answer to your title question is that console controllers don't have enough buttons to cover all of the separate control functions, and Fallout 4 (from which assets this game was made) was built with consoles in mind. This seemed to the developers to be the best combination of the functions for a system where they needed to double up the use of a single button.
---
It doesn't take you to all of them, I know this because I had to hunt the remaining ones down.  It also doesn't *because it's not the main quest*
---
I have the opposite problem but the same frustration. Every time I try to throw a grenade it almost always gun bashes first. Even when I hold it. Why in the hell would a CQB ability be on the same key bind as a mid- to long-distance combat ability? And I'm pretty sure rebinding one rebinds the other.
---
I recommend walking, at least until you feel you have explored the path you would be fast traveling along well enough. It's how you run into random encounters, find cool loot, unmarked locations, run into enemies to fight for XP and weapons, etc.

---
Yeah that's a side quest that ties in directly to the main quest, literally all of those locations are the path you go for the main quest.  If you don't pick up those logs literally nothing you're doing would make sense, there would be no reason to go to any of those areas.  You are following the overseer's path, that is the main quest
---
Thanks for the tip on diluted!! I stopped going to nukes alone bc it's just too inconvenient
---
I have 6/10. They usually spawn inside the house with several washing machines. Dunno how its called. Its next to the garage.
---
No. Even a Tse dragon wouldn’t ruin your experience. The dps on those is terribly low due to reload speed. 
---
A main gun that’s Tse will though. Such as a shotty, a handmade or the like.
---
For the first two months I never saw Graham, just heard legends of him.  Then in the last week I’ve found him on two separate occasions.  Once heading towards the Whitesprings golf course from the south, and once outside the Nuka Cola factory.  Just listening to him ramble on about how he’s gonna save up and get lots of meat and “retire” at a cabin somewhere always makes me laugh
---
Okay hold on, what are you implying in general terms with this comment? Are you saying he should rate things in part based on how much money the game cost to develop? Because that's actually insane. And he didn't find the world building engaging because everyone's already dead. That's an entirely fair opinion. 
---
If he didn't find the game fun, then why should he give it a good score? Reviewers need to rate things based on their own experience so they can be consistent and build trust and an understanding with their audience based on the reviewers likes and dislikes. If you watch a video from Totalbiscuit, you know that okay, he values 3 things above all else: meaningful progression systems, tight and responsive gameplay, and technical stability. However if you watch a review from someone like Angry Joe, he values role playing and in depth character interactions above most else from what I can tell. So while someone like TB hated Fallout 4 because the combat was pretty clunky compared to other FPS's that were out at the time, it was pretty buggy, and the level up system was a bit too open for his liking, Angry Joe really liked it because of what he perceived to be strong exploration and fun characters (although not as good as Skyrim which is why he rated Fallout 4 a bit lower). 
---
My point is, on his scale, 5 is average. Given what he values in a game, it's a below average game. We as the viewer can understand that and so it's a useful tool when combined with other reviewers who value other things in games. 
---
The recipe goes for about 19,800 c. Just a heads up. I've never had them offered : /
---
Wait, so they put a room in game, and expect people not to try to get in? Or is it a room where you have to fast travel to?
---
I had him show up behind me at Camp Venture while doing a Forbidden Knowledge run, he wiped out all the ferals and scorched as I just casually walked to the drop box.
---
You must not play that many games. I lose all immersion when I see a massive bug or the game crashes entirely. 
---
Me neither, your specs look good, it must be the 2080 then although I'm very unfamiliar with it's specs.
---
And it must be a pretty severe bottleneck since my specs are pretty meh aside from the gpu and my performance is significantly better than your much better PC.
---
Intel i7 4790k, GTX 1080 SC ACX 3.0, 16GB DDR3 2400.

Ok thanks. I was getting sad that my gameplay experience was ruined

Man, I have psychobuff HOTKEYED I use it so much. Never addicted all the way to level 76 so far
---
It's in all likelihood the slow memory coupled with only 4 cores. The CPU is at stock?
---
Honestly, before they up the stash limit again I’d love it if they stabilized the stashes better, at least on Xbox.
---
I don’t know how common it is but my game’s crashed a good dozen times the past month when I was swapping stuff in and out of my stash, especially legendary weapons

I had a Grognak's Axe with -90% carry weight, 50% armor pen and 40% cripple chance that i got randomly from a mutant. I've put a good 20 hours into farming legendaries without ever getting anything that i've wanted, so that was my pride and joy.
---
I somehow lost it, and have subsequently lost a lot of my will to play the game. I have no idea where it went, im assuming i accidentally sold it while getting rid of junk legendaries at a vendor.

Weighed 3 units without any perks at all. Im fuckin' sad.
---
In fallout 4 there were multiple recipe for items so yea you should be able to 
---
I'll try to take a short video of it tonight. Not sure if i'll be able to lure anybody in.. not everybody falls for the arrow pointing down that says "dropped loot".. some do though. Someone fell in when I wasnt there yesterday and completely destroyed every single item in my camp haha
---
That's so weird. I'm server hopping right now hoping to get metal deep pocketed limb plans right THERE. And every 30 seconds "...*scrambled noise*  THIS IS GRAFTONS MAYOR..."
---
If anybody wonders: I don't know that the plans spawn there for definite but I think they do. That's why I'm trying.
---
Rofl and every friend of mine who was a duper i gave them all their stuff back already.  If you don't stop us all you can't stop any of us.  Also let me go ahead and collect the gamertags of all the people supporting this ban wave for bounty purposes.  Better hope you didn't post it in any reddit posts. Pissing off people who can put a 25k cap bounty on your character = not a good idea. 
---
Dude, you sound like you enjoy abuse. It's like giving your money to someone in good faith and they take it and piss all over you. Then, when they give you a kleenex to dab some of the piss off of you, your response is: "Omg you're trying, I can't thank you enough." For your own psychological well being, assuming you're a real person, grow a backbone. 
---
honestly pathetic how insecure you guys are about strawmanning an inb4 post about a 10 year old game to defend this game like what the fuck is even the point
---
After the patch comes out for Xbox I will Def be going sweaty for one of these
---
Another one in the Uncanny Caverns, in the recording before the bridge that crosses a small area of water. They insist that it's super pure and clean, but due to legal reasons, people should stick to the bridge and stay out of the water.
---
Jump down in the shallow pool and you'll find a baby carriage down there.
---
Looks like someones baby fell in and someone got sued!
---
Id be happy if I didn't get disconnected or blue screened every 15 mins.  Screws and springs aren't on my complaint list currently. 
---
Also want to add that the Nuke Launch tape makes zero sense, as she doesn't exist anymore so making a holotape after you do the Main Quest action to trigger it is a giant plothole.
---
Just because there are aspects of the game that are fun doesn't excuse the horrific state the game launched in.  It's unacceptable for a $60 AAA game to launch like that.   
---
I also like the game, but I don't even recommend it to friends without being very frank about the many problems that still persist.  
---
And yeah hey it's great they are patching the bugs but its been what, 4 or 5 patches now that have been literally nothing but bug fixes.  They really should have left the game in beta until all of this shit was handled and launched the game in like February or so, as at this pace that's when we will actually have a stable base game that doesn't constantly crash and hopefully all the duping finally patched.
---
What’s wrong with just using boiled water. It only takes like 30 seconds to make a ton of them. 
---
&gt;Yeah that's a side quest that ties in directly to the main quest
---
**That's literally the overseer quest.** I'm really sorry but this can't be this hard to understand.  Her free states message is literally "whelp can't get in here." The quest requires you to create a scorched detection system with the help of someone who is long dead.  How does that require knowledge of her journey?  I have a feeling you never played past the first few quests where the Overseer is actually relevant.
---
Its sad isnt it?
---
agree.  i prefer to craft guns and play with all the building systems.  we should be able to scrap or get plans for certain 'legendary' type things.  maybe have to find or craft a weapon with "slots" open.  witcher did something like this in an expansion.  it was expensive to craft but it was worth it.  used runes or something...
---
And quite a NICE hunting rifle as well, congratulations 
---
They were duped lol
---
Screws, Spring, Lead, Fiber Optics, Aluminum, Adhesive, Ballistic Fiber. Key materials for crafting and repairing gears.   
---
More eye opening 
---
Why waste that time at all when my purifier makes perfectly good enough water to boil?
---
&gt; That's literally the overseer quest.
---
I think you need to start a new character, and see what you are actually doing.  You seem willfully ignorant to the fact that your only role in this game is following the overseer
---
I love my friends and I love playing games with them. But when they try to play with me in 76, I feel slowed down and unable to do what i want. I usually end up being bodygaurd/chauffer. I just want to explore, build workshops and do events. 76 is a good team game, but i love the solo much better. That includes launching nukes solo. 
---
You never find her body.  Nuke Launch proves she never died.  Now I'm certain you've never played through this.
---
Oh that's my bad, I misread, I thought the items were on the ground when disconnected.
---
Connection. Have you checked your internet settings/all cables plugged in/router on/etc?
---
I think this game was an attempt to emulate the Shark Card model to bring in resources so the next Fallout can have temperature sensitive deathclaw testicles.  So, yeah they are going to hold on.
---
Thank you for the help and the valuable information. :)
---
Depends on the workshop and the type of resource.  If you have an issue getting enough acid to smelt your ore - take hemlock holes for a few hours - I’ve only taken it once and that was like a month ago and I’m still flush with acid.
---
What the fuck does this have to do with cheating? 
---
Thanks! It would be nice to at least see how it looks like.
---
I am all up into trying to make a trap c.a.m.p, so all ideas are welcome.
---
I knew there was a ton I left out. I'm super new to the game so I'm sorry for the stupid questions but what would the fiber optics be fore? Also... you can craft gears?
---
Even just fridges that slow down food spoilage would be awesome
---
Sure, it's partly PvP. Its also, co-op, solo exploration,  survival, crafting, different things to different people.  None of which answers what a high level gets out of bashing on a 6th level newbie who's just out of the vault.  Seriously, doing that and smashing camps give zero benefit so what's in it for you? To me it seems a creepy malfunction, like torturing puppies. PvP is fine, just pick on someone your own size.
---
No. I hold the key and it gun bashes the first time almost every time. And there should be an option to throw a grenade or prime a grenade like most FPS games. Nothing is more frustrating then throwing a plasma grenade and having the enemy stroll on past it because there is no way to prime it. Same issue when having to throw a grenade on an enemy is standing on stairs or an elevated position. The grenade bounces away and blows 2 seconds later which is a long time when it comes to combat.
---
I have five characters.  I think you need to read the name of the quest you called a side quest.  And also actually pay attention to the fact that the characters who actually give you the main storyline *never even mention her*.
---
Apparently you didn't, as this is the final log http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Overseer%27s_log_-_Mountainside
---
Hahahah this is so awesome. 
---
Today I went on a walkabout for a few hours. I'm getting close to finishing up the main quests, so I took some time off to do some exploring. It, as already mentioned, is a great way to open up some previously unexplored areas. And by doing this, I guess it too can open up new fast travel locations. Sorta a win/win. 
---
Aluminum
---
Springs
---
Screws
---
Lead/Steel for ammo
---
Ballistic Fiber for armor repairs
---
Wonderglue for everything
---
If I were you I'd use the 'tag' feature when crafting/repairing and in the overworld, crap and junk will be marked if it contains the material you marked, really useful for not picking up shit you don't need.
---
Omg. If you are sad drop the damn thing. I am so sick of that complaint. If something in which you have complete control over ruins your experience, you have nobody but yourself to blame. 
---
I dig this idea. They can make the faction hubs like work shops. Once captured it would give you a large budget for your faction settlement. 
---
Just like camps you would be notified if your faction Hub is occupied on the server. Then you could decide if you want defend this Hub or jump servers to your own. 
---
Dreaming, but wouldn't it be nice. 
---
I go back to 3 just to run her quests, love her commentary and naiveté. 
---
Key is to aim for headshots... Just kidding try to grind or buy a TSE weapon
---
I loved the enclave radio in Fo3, my favorite station without a doubt. I want a radio station that just plays patriotic music again. And listening to the rightfully elected President Eden discuss the fair election that definitively happened was inspiring. 
---
Tse
---
Nicely done 
---
Elegant solution. I see some value in decentralization as well—part of this game is trudging around and getting junk while you do. 
---
When ever I read terminals and see the final posts about them venturing out. I always feel the need to say "god speed, [npc name]"
---
Its hard for anyone out there not a player. 
---
Um, not attempt to counteract my argument at all? For every good thing in the game there are 3 more problems that go with it, so I don’t know what you’re going for here. Are you saying that I don’t have evidence for what I said? There’s a shitload if you want it.
---
Yes, every day! Every time I enter vendor trading or stash. I just have gotten to point two enter twice. Really annoying
---
I got one once from buffout because I had like 8 in a row. But it isn’t as prevalent as other fo games.
---
See I found one ^^^
---
Yes. Everything else that uses internet on the PS4 works.
---
Sometimes it looks like people here are the scorched. Blind hate and herd mentality.
---
Drill instructor says "drink before you get thirsty. If you drink when you're thirsty, you're wrong! You will have 3 non-sweetened, non-carbonated beverages on your tray with every meal! You eyeballing me, son? Drop and give me thirty! Fn cluedart..."
---
I am looking for one also 
---
Sounds like you probably just need better weapons 
---
What's the plot?
---
i have found if you dont button mash the exit prompts to leave a station it will let you exit without re entering. wait for the exit prompt and wait a second and hit exit 
---
Just to clarify, are you being snarky? Internet anonymity makes it hard to tell.
---
When was it bugged? Been working perfectly fine since beta for me on xbox
---
And there's no corpse and no on tape death.  Even ends with "hopefully not for the last time." Then we get another log.  Literally confirms she survived that encounter.
---
I slap on my trusy prototype hazmat suit and run around realllly fasy. Though to be real, there really needs to be a way to wear armour under those things. 
---
Good point, thanks
---
are you a thirteen year old girl. “Omg Becky, your shoes are soooo tacky!”
---
Amen. 
---
I keep forgetting about the tag for search feature, Good point. 
---
well at least you seem to understand what I'm saying
---
I always transfer my items, between my two accounts, via trade menu. Yeah, it sucks and is clunky, but it guarantees that the server will save items in either of our inventory and not on the ground. 
---
I would recommend that method. Thanks for the heads up, I'll need to share that with my guild cause we have a habit of tossing stuff in bags to give to each other 
---
Yes. A casino with maybe two, three games max. Multiplayer. Queuing support and you must show up within a fast travel amount of time to claim your seat. 
---
well just looking in the video he made a lot of "barracks" looking buildings with the barracks lookign bed with a foot locker, maybe next to some power armor crafting stations. i liked the little defense walls put along the top of metal wall buildings to make it look more like a bunker
---
I did a "command room" in my camp by putting desks with a TV on them so it looks like a computer monitor, then putting glowing maps and flags next to it etc
---
Are you sure? I've found this outfit many times. Mostly just out in the world
---
I'd like the Nuka Cola mix stations to work, at the very least in the soda fountain at Whitespring...
---
Lake, man.
---
I visited dyer chemical, in the mire, earlier today and there were robobrains everywhere. smoke shields everywhere 
---
Maybe you'll convince the support team with that argument if they ever ban you
---
Good to know, I had heard otherwise.
---
Ate only raw meat for weeks and not knew why i kept getting sick.
---
It’s only fixed on pc. The patch for console is next week
---
Nah Bethesda is dead to me and my friends. Never buying a release from them ever again. Didn't get 76 and was disappointed with fallout 4.
---
[This video shows how easy and widespread shilling is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uIrnEIuL8o) 
---
Found him once in front of the Overseer's camp, too bad I was only lvl 22
---
How are you defending them figuring out a way to make a open world online game like what? The game still runs worse than any of there single player games let alone other open world online games. 
---
"high standards of lore" they basically broke almost every aspect just so they could asset flip. 
---
Ooooh dude its irony ffs!! Exactly bc of snowflakes like yourself.
---
As a Huntington native, I’m in full agreement. I think Marshall’s campus would be interesting too.
---
Doesn’t make sense not to include it but to put in Grafton of all places (no offense, Graftonians). It’s just too big of a city by WV standards to ignore.
---
I honestly would have been okay if 76 was single player and had these glitches but the fact that it’s multiplayer changes everything. A lot of glitches can put you in a disadvantage or give other players an edge.
---
Ah, that would make sense. Thank you!
---
I like how I can walk into a random cave and find a n albino death claw and be completely caught flat footed and have to survive and figure out a way to slay it in the heat of the moment. 
---
Some of the FO4 mods let you brew coffee using the coffeepots and the coffee tin junk items.  That would be cool as well.
---
I don't know what dorfing is but thanks Todd Howard!
---
Agreed. I suppose the devs figured it would stop people to wear other underarmor, but there needs to be other options, not just power armor and hazmat suits. 
---
Conceptually a few tries. My camp mostly looks normal, but I have a 2 story garage, with stair case that goes up to a single floor tile third floor that is enclosed.. that itself is an enclosed tower of sorts that acts as a pit when someone walks in. At the bottom are rad traps and a brick powered door (keypad on interior lolz) as the only way out. One side is windowed so I can hop down and see my 'testee' and flip the switch if i want, or wait for them to figure out my code via lettering on the wall if they are quick witted.. thus the test :) I borrowed ideas from different trap camp videos I saw on youtube from this game and others. 
---
thanks.  yes, this devils advocate point of view is my current view on it.  There are people out there that had free reign on simple mechanics that absolutely destroyed any type of 'honest chance' to be competitive with them.  It is one thing to have a bug, but allot of these were allowed to go on way too long without rollbacks or bans. 
---
Releasing it as a buggy mess should have been a big NO NO for an online multiplayer game, or at the very least...some alacrity in dealing with exploits.  I mean...infinite exp, infinite explosives, infinite resources, and duplicate items...Bethesda let it all through.  I wish I would have bought the game today instead of at launch. 
---
I’ve run into honey beasts both times I passed that tree house north of camp venture
---
Isn't ballistic fibre still the bane of the world? I haven't played in a few months but I remember everyone avoiding armour because of how bad it was
---
I dont, just want people to think what I'm actually saying. Also, I get it it is multiplayer, but it plays like a solo game so what's the big deal. They are youtubers and got specifically targeted, that's quite obvious, so I dont know it just seems shitty.
---
Got my first after at almost 300 lvls it will come
---
Not completely, while those who used it to gain infinite carry weight were exploiting a lot of people (including myself mind you) used it only after the massive game breaking bug in which you had to strip naked everytime you logged off or else you lost carry weight upon logging in. It was far easier to just use the glitch then deal with getting disconnected from a server and having to relog in strip down log out the relog in and reequip everything ESPECIALLY if you happened to get lucky and the server you joined had a nuke zone. There has never been a just cause for dupping.
---
&gt; And there's no corpse and no on tape death
---
That is the final log, look at the order
---
TOS are classified as legal documents 
---
Dromedary perk still works to get more hydration from water. Based on my perks I'm half bear, half camel... With scales and kangaroo legs.
---
Around Treehouse and Mosstown I think?
---
Especially fun when you die then DC on the way back to a stash... yay?
---
any tip is a good tip, i’ll check it out úwù 
---
reading over the patch notes feels like I'm looking patch notes for a beta
---
It's a room you can only get to by using a console command to teleport there, and you need to find out the room's editor ID to do it. So basically it's unreachable unless the ID is datamined from the game, which is banned by Bethesda because it requires the use of programs like cheat engine.
---
Are you banning dupers? Also what about human NPC in dev test room, should we expect human NPC at some point? 
---
Yeah it was coming and going.
---
Agreed. How could THAT not be included? 
---
I am not a "duper" - hell I haven't played since November as I am just waiting for them to actually make the game polished. But I disagree with it.
---
I feel like it sets a bad precedent - there are tons of games, online games, where people will exploit something to do with the game that was unintended behavior. 
---
It is always, 100% the fault of the developer that those exploits are possible. It is entirely possible for people to even unintentionally use said exploits.
---
For this reason, I would not support, nor do I think you will see anyone being banned for exploiting dupe glitches outside of youtubers or streamers who are actively promoting and sharing the activity.
---
Nonetheless, my position is that banning people for this kind of stuff is a horrible precedent - and it is not something anyone in any major online game does, with good reason, especially one in as dire straights as this.
---
Going after people profiting off of the glitches monetarily in the real world? I think that's fine. I think they should pursue action against anyone selling in game items for real world money, period.
---
I don't think going after "dupers" is right - the fact that people are duping, and feel the need to dupe, is a direct result of game bugs and game design issues. If we found out that getting water faster from streams was unintended behavior, and it was supposed to have been slow EVERYWHERE, including streams, just as slow as a water pump - it would not be right to punish people who took advantage of that broken game mechanic.
---
My feelings might be different if this game had some horrible online marketplace, like Diablo 3 did upon launch, where people could sell in game items. Even in that case, there WERE dupe glitches - and no one was punished - only people actively doing things like using robots to farm gold, etc were actually banned from that game.
---
Like I said, item duplication sucks, and makes for a shitty in-game economy, but banning anyone and everyone who has duped items like many in this subreddit seem to be salivating over would be a horrible precedent, and would likely nuke any chance this game has of recovering.
---
Nothing official has ever been stated about the exact chronological order.  Nuke Launch happening after entirely eliminates your gripe.
---
Yeah Lucas was my dude, that really hurt when I found out.  I made my own dlc in the form of a hit list.  
---
Took them out one by one for their crimes against the wasteland.
---
You were supposed to remain Silent 
---
*activates Halo Installation*
---
 LOL. Alt is by backwards key. Guess how I know I'm reloading my sniper. I have to be careful. ;)
---
 Still I won't be Alt Tabbing, which can kill you too. ;)
---
And each studio would have to fact check these claims from each other studio. Telling you right now that’s not gonna happen. It’s too expensive, aside from the fact that for example Sony wouldn’t give a shit you cheated in Nintendo’s Mario Kart. No studio is gonna give a crap about what someone allegedly did in another game. And evidence is what? That some studio said you did? They control all the logs, and therefore aren’t partial.
---
IGN：An0Mas
---
Wasn't worth 60 on release and still isn't in my opinion. But who knows they might bring it around in the future. 
---
I'm not familiar with berserker armor. I know Berserker is a weapon prefix for the lower your defense the higher your damage on a weapon.
---
Go back in time and buy it with atoms
---
You didn’t miss anything. No one cares about the haters anymore.
---
Honestly, after nearly two months, if you still have to complain every time someone mentions this game, then that says more about you than Bethesda.
---
I get it. You were excited to get a new game. You probably loved the previous ones. So it fell short. So the people that put the game out made mistakes. You’re angry, fine. 
---
But none of this was surprising to a lot of people and compared to what other publishers have been doing over the years, it’s really not *that* bad in the grand scheme of things. 
---
I think you’re more angry at the “Betrayal” perpetrated by a beloved developer than you are at the game itself, regardless of its faults. But you can’t blame Bethesda for following industry trends that come before them. 
---
Bethesda doesn’t manufacture canvas bags, they don’t distill and package alcohol. They outsource that to 3rd party manufactures. It’s up to those manufacturers to source materials and make it happen. Sure Bethesda approves it, but still. Shit happens. Materials and costs change. Deadlines still have to be met. 
---
At least Bethesda did *something*, even if it’s “too little too late” to some, it’s better than the “tough titty” stance taken by developers like EA and Ubisoft. 
---
Or maybe, just maybe, don’t spend 100s of dollars on useless marketing crap. It’s hardly ever what you expect it to be. For the majority of people, this is common knowledge. You can’t blame a company for making something people are still willing to pay for. Honestly this whole model of collectors editions and shit have always been generally a rip-off. Don’t complain because you chose to waste your money on needless junk.
---
Everything that can be said about Bethesda and this game and all the hate over it has been said already. At this point you’re beating a dead horse and it’s kinda sad. Just go play New Vegas or FO4 or something if you love those games so much. It’s not like because 76 exists that’s *all* you have to play.
---
Believe it or not,  to everyone has the highest expectation of what a game is or should be. Not everyone plays games the same way. It just seems like a waste of energy and time to begrudge people for something so subjective.
---
Sorry to rant at you, but seriously, get over it! Have a good day.
---
Great video Samasoku, well filmed!  
---
This is 'Hoffman', you've been by my mega stop a couple times :)
---
A friend had this problem with their head and we googled it. Turns out the easiest way was to let your character die and respawn. It worked for them. Hope it works for you.
---
&gt;Do you walk into movies that you don't want to see and tell everyone they're wrong for paying to see them? Do you stand outside concerts for bands you don't like and yell at people they're wrong for being there?
---
I dunno, do you walk up to movie critics and scream that they're pitiful, friendless assholes that need to find a hobby? Criticism goes hand in hand with art, and Fallout 76 is like a bad movie that falls below even "The Room" threshold of redeemability - so bad it's bad. And I will never stop telling you that and I am not going to leave because it offends you.
---
Or got the Plans from a Workshop Quest? 
---
Middle Mountain Cabins. You’ll  get honey beasts, Yao guai, or rad scorpions. Run if you get scorpions haha
---
It was a limited time shop item. It is gone now unless you can get someone who bought it to paint for you.
---
This would be a cool immersive addition, to add on to your idea they could even make barbecuing a little public event that invites players to come and they can pick up a plate and eat at the table with you for a buff, maybe stay full for the whole play session or decreased hunger. Maybe even add “food for groups” recipes that take more ingredients but all offer players partaking different boons and such.
---
White Springs and surrounding area have a fair amount. Mostly SW and SE areas outside building complexes
---
Dead characters can give quests too.  I don't care about how you feel about NPCs, doesn't change the fact that what the main storyline is about and the quests you do through it only relate to the overseer in that she once went there.
---
Alright thanks 
---
I fast travel for menial stuff like events and grabbing specific items/junk. When I decide to do a quest or use my treasure maps, I walk and make it an adventure.
---
&gt;r
---
I haven't noticed any items dropped, but can confirm I have had an Excavator Chest unequip twice without me doing it.  
---
I only have 2 legendaries so I would know if they were gone, but this seems to be a common issue
---
In this joke I'm Todd Howard trying to convince you to buy atoms.
---
No I forget the name it there is high level enemies there so it's hard for me to get 
---
I really, really hoped I would just stumble across the Mystery Hole while playing.  It's so quirky and neat and literally in the middle of nowhere.
---
There is no followup to what happened at mountainside at all, it is clearly the last one.  On top of it being the one you have to play last to complete the quest
---
i ain’t afraid of no crackhead mr krabs
---
You mean like there has been in every game they've made since Oblivion? 
---
Lord knows why.
---
This could be solved by making the current assets with the current cooking crafting asset function. The only problem is, it would require additionally motion capture/rigging when it's completely apparent FO76 is meant to replicate current functions that exist without adding more to avoid excess production costs.
---
It's not impossible though. Rainbow 6: Siege includes new features post-release that deal with adding new rigging. For instance, Lesions poison darts or the knock back from Nomad/Operation Outbreak.
---
Ain't that the truth
---
for some brilliant reason they decided to only have it on the Atom shop for 48 hours.
---
I presume they'll bring it bacck when they are in desperate need of more cash
---
in other words; its on the most unstable foundation ever. 
---
the creation engine was good for its time, yeah but now its horribly dated and it'll be the downfall of bethesda
---
I have absolutely no idea what you mean by Fallout 4's "limited modding system", it's just as moddable as every other bethesda game. If you're referring to the in-game mods option on the menu, that's completely irrelevant and something you should never be touching in that game, you should use a mod manager like all past titles
---
Or allow us to tune the jukebox to a radio station of our choosing? Jukebox does look cool.
---
I played fallout 76 until I was almost finished with the game, I explored, I did side quests, I took pictures of me and my friends adventures, I tried out different ways of playing, I tried to PVP, but guess what, Me and all of my friends deleted it, and my friends didn’t even need outside input, they just didn’t see enough good to justify the bad. I’m saying that OP shouldn’t talk about “unbiased” when the only thing I see the people on this sub think is bad about fallout 76 is the micro-transaction and merchandise shit that Bethesda pulled, not the game itself. I never said anything about how Angry Joe influencing my opinion, my views have conflicted his many a time, but he is one of the only people I see that usually stay unbiased when downright reviewing a game, so I don’t know what you're trying to say when you say “It isn’t that hard of a concept to grasp”
---
I want a dresser that stores outer wear!  I want one of each dress up item type and I scavenge/search/buy them.  I hate digging through them to find armor and such.   
---
Id also like some kind of storage container that I can put things in and other people can take it out thats in my CAMP.  I dont trust dropping items because the bag is buggie.  Also if I put it out front on my 'passerby deck' they could take all the ammo I dont use.    Tip jar and a 'give aways' box
---
Moira's personality is what stopped me from nuking megaton.  The residents owe their lives to her.  
---
I have this issue as well on xbox. And on some notes the words are shifted to the left side of the page so the first letter of each line is missing. 
---
Is food and water really that big of a deal for anyone? I have never even cooked anything and have a single large water purifier. I currently have over 40 cans of dog food and around the same purified water. So weird I just can't imagine what you are doing so different that you need to make all this food lol.
---
Hoffman brother! Glad to see you here! Is your shop open again?
---
yea ESO absolutely still makes them money, but it is very very far from making the majority of their revenue even combined with all the other Fallout and Elder Scrolls properties, much less all by itself

Bug: BoS Combat Armor Arm Plans Not Spawning
---
Platform: PC \[Ryzen 7-2700x, 16GB DDR4, 850 EVO drive, GTX960 4GB (latest drivers)\]
---
Issue (short): I've visited Grafton Train Station and Responder Greg several hundred times. I've seen the BoS Chest 10+, and the BoS Legs 10+. The BoS Arm Plans are not spawning.

As a Destiny and Fallout fan I believe Destiny 2 and 76 are two sides of the same coin. Destiny 2 came out and was not what any of the fans wanted from the game but was clean and about as big free as a triple A game can be. 76 is definitely what most were expecting on release but the multitude of bugs and unfinished pieces are what ruin the experience. I felt like I could forgive bungie for executing improperly and fixing the game over time, with 76 it came out completely broken and will take a lot more to bring back my faith in Bethesda.

You hold the button to throw a grenade, and press it to power attack. Not the other way around
---
Walk like a man my son...
---
The minigun with the shredder mod looks pretty menacing. Just stay away from me if you see me in game lol
---
&gt;Dead characters can give quests too. 
---
Not really, the game is just hyper lazy and what it considers quests is even laughable
---
Not one word of ESO in that article. Not one. Maybe put down the blunt and pick up a book. Link is for lazy bastards who can’t click the first one. 
---
But here we are, once again, someone that can’t utilize a search engine.

You make google sad when you don’t search.

I'm honestly glad they didn't wait though...

"Thank you so much Bethesda, for fixing the problem you created for everyone to deal with in the first place! My heroes!
---
Thanks a ton, Bungo! I can verify all this is true - got a few, and learned the plan on my first scrapping.
---
on one hand we have people being ungrateful for everything, on the hand we have people who are grateful for being roobed after being punched in the face like you
---
I really like the Development this whole thing goes. But basically they doing their job. Only a reminder: They released an buggy and unfinished game and advertised it as full release with next gen tech and all. I am looking at you Todd Howard.
---
Despite the amount of buffout variants drugs I’ve had my character use for weight increase and melee increase he’s never gotten an addiction
---
I honestly coudln't find the area you were referring too, only found like two or tree mutfruit plants.
---
How is that devils advocate? you are saying the truth
---
Definitely a good comparison. Harder to forgive Bethesda for such a blatantly broken game though.
---
This dude is an extreme OG champ. Thank you. My weeklong hunt is over!
---
you must have ahd some god awful single player experinces in your life then
---
Looks like a promising area. I'll look around a bit more before I decide, thanks!
---
I've built a Radio Transmission tower. With a little more work, my broadcast will reach across Appalachia! It'll all make sense soon. I'll be sure to let you know when its online.
---
Yeah, there are some here and there but not a lot to be honest.
---
Try exiting to main menu and loading back in. May trigger it to recognize you have it or it could just remove it from your inventory. I've encountered both when exiting to menu in past to get around bugs
---
Would you happen to know if its level locked like the handmade plan?
---
They spawn almost exclusively in the mire. I've found some just south of the gas station (near harper's ferry), but have also seen a few near the roads further up north. I also recall seeing them spawn in that gas station north of the top of the world, although that one seems to be a 50/50 between a honeybeast and yao guai.

Prepare yourself if you're doing it solo.

Unless Nuke Launch is the follow-up.  And considering I completed the quest by playing Nuke Launch last youre wrong on that too.

Super edgy.

Mission ideas:
---
Farm 1000000 springs
---
Kill 1000 supermutants above level 30 with a pipe pistol
---
Kill a level 81 deathclaw with a combat knife
---
Gather 76 purified waters and sell them to Grahm
---
Tame a mirelurk queen
---
Go through all the areas of the map without fast travelling. You have 2 in game hours to do this
---
Farm 500 ballistic fibers
---
Listen to all 18 overseers holotapes and try not to fall asleep
---
Sell 100 psychos to other players
---
Run for 10 minutes around whitesprings golf courses with feral ghouls behind you
---
Protect golf course house ghouls from other players for 20 minutes
---
Destroy 10 player Camps
---
Find 10 dupers and report them to bethesda: grants you the Snitch trophy
---
Just made a big purchase so I’m spent but I’m commenting so I can look you up later. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Nm fixed it by reloading
---
Well if you want to compare it to a restaurant than like this. I work in food and sometimes the same people come everyday. If someone comes up to me and says “hey my food wasn’t that good today.” I take their food back, find the problem, and give them new good food. I make sure it’s right, and most of the time they come back again. Showing you care about a guest means a lot to most people who aren’t assholes. So if we think of Oblivion, and FO3, and Skyrim, and FO4 as the meals we’ve eaten before then you’re disappointed at a fallout 76, BUT if Bethesda gives us 60$ back in fixed or even eventually new content, and brings the game up to the standard of those other games then there’s no reason to stay upset. When you come back next time the “food” should be Skyrim quality, because people mess up, but you know that they care about their standards. The analogy has a lot of holes tbh, but I think this is what he/she was trying to convey.
---
Calling people NPCs, a true intellectual.
---
Okay I don't care.  Stop moving goalposts.
---
Yes, they're back logged
---
What system?
---
alright i will give that a go, so far i found one near monongah but no royal jelly. the search continues 
---
I actually killed a guy because I thought he was stealing from 'my' stash
---
A lot of people have fun playing with others, so I'm not trying to deter you from enjoying that experience, but depending on some factors like build, weapons. armor, etc, you can do it solo. It can be a struggle the first time, especially if you're not at an optimal place in your character development but it's doable.
---
Most of the bugs don't even bother me. I appreciate that they're doing their best to stabilize the game. Bethesda can only do so many things with such a huge game and people don't understand that.
---
Nope, happens out of combat too. And it’s not like I got hit, I just go down randomly. And when I get knocked down it’ll still show my health at the 10%
---
thank you, i will keep an eye out for the event :3 
---
Holy shit the developers are trying to save the sinking ship of their most recent release?! Never would have seen that coming thank you Todd!!!
---
Probably. But waiting until the dude left and then destroying them would have been easier and less in-your-face. Communicating with the guy about why he was being a tool may have helped too.
---
Why did you post this here?
---
But they've been said in court that they are not legally binding so they basically aren't.
---
WTF, got 163 levels to go then.
---
Luck of the Draw has been broken since before the patch. Rank 1 appears to behave correctly, rank 2 doesn't proc at all (ever), and rank 3 appears to proc less than rank 1.
---
I'm not moving anything, you're just delusional about this game because your mind refuses to accept that it was a bad game since that would make you challenge your wisdom in buying it.  It's just cognitive dissonance
---
I'm kind of a noob when it comes to that stuff, hence my cry for help. But I'll go google that and try and figure it out. Good idea. Thanks! 
---
Jesus Christ
---
I wish I could give more specific locations but I rarely use the map, I just travel by landmarks at this point. Honestly a good bet if you can't find any more out there is just to go to the mire and start running off into the wilderness.
---
Take that up with the wiki, it says it right at the bottom.
---
edit: grants you the Golden Snitch trophy*
---
I mean, if you enjoy your location, go for it. I might move back there if I was mistaken about the danger of the spawns. 
---
that is most definitely the plan if i keep turning up empty like this..i just want my blackberry crisps. 😔 
---
Apart from shotguns, that skill almost never triggers for me. Maybe 1 in 75 shots from a lever-action rifle at level 3 procs it.
---
Hah. Well this game does seem to attract a more PvE oriented and softcore PvP crowd, so I imagine you'd be getting a lot of angry and fearful responses to causing such wanton and unprovoked damage!
---
I like the RP aspect. I've tried doing it before, but never get many responses. Most people seem like they have microphones disabled and don't engage back, whether trying to be a drill sergeant, a crazy raider looking for chems or Mr Ward in his bathrobe and slippers, looking for his wife, Patricia, who got lost after the bombs fell.
---
I used to stock up on Propaganda flyers and do speeches about communism to people. Did have people chasing me off in a blaze of glory there xD
---
Irational Fear is a event where you can harvest a lot of honey and encounter a lot the honey beasts, beware it can spawn a high level yah gaui
---
&gt; Vendor Bot Chad
---
if theres no vendor bot stacy im gonna be disappointed
---
Very cool addition my mans. I would love it. Now featuring "nuclear barbecues!"
---
Obviously because the fallout games will lead into the elder scrolls universe eventually. In 1-2 games they’ll mesh together with pipe rifles shooting magic bullets at super goblin mutants and elder scorchedragons. 
---
It also says possible.  Because it has never been confirmed.
---
Knowing your father figure died really hurts. Sometimes it's nice not to hurt as much. The chems can help with that. Try it....
---
we hope this doesn't happen to us
---
The dev room thing was fake. It's just a modded copy of fallout 4. They added fake items and skins with mod to make it look legit. Some of the pics have the wrong HUD (the food/water bars are from a fo4 survival mod) and they avoid doing things like opening the pipboy or pause menus, or looking at weapons &amp; armor in the invintory screen (which have a slightly different look in 4 and 76) in the video because it would give it away. 
---
My only real complaint about the game at this point is the lack of things to do at high level. Events are too infrequent and most are low level. Queen fight is basically a longer scorchbeast fight no additional mechanics but with actual loot (though none of it is really special). I hope they drop us some new content soon that increases replayability. 
---
Lets waste this bitch
---
I'm surprised mules haven't become a thing yet. I had half a dozen of them in diablo. 
---
Amazing!
---
&gt;Scaly Skin still bugged

---
I've seen several posts regarding this issue
---
If other people are like me they don't feel like they need to give thanks... I'd be more thankful if they fixed all these bugs and issues before the game was launched because all the bugs/exploits/issues gave the game a terrible reputation and I really enjoyed this game/wish it was as good as it was supposed to be.
---
Check out freak show to the west of watoga. I've had a handful spawn there. There's also a cave that always spawns 2 at the top right of the map. There's no world marker there but if you travel in the southwest direction from the compass on the map they're there.
---
They should but at the same time.... you can’t afford it? Selling out one vendor should be more than enough caps to travel around as much as you want for a play session.
---
Would love to Nuked ^TM Black Tar Coffee
---
One, but you'll need to add oil, leather, and wood after midnight.
---
I think they straight up buffed the reload speed, intentionally or not. I don't have any mutations, and I've been using the lever for a long time as my sniper weapon. Definitely way faster that it was before the patch.
---
No problem, would appreciate some karma and an upvote if possible :)
---
I've gotten 3 in 264 levels. They are stupid rare

---
The corrupted account happened to me the exact same way it did with you through a large amount of treasure maps I managed to stop it from crashing by moving in different directions when I spawned it took a good few hour but was worth it in the end 
---
I usually give a good attack, I just wasnt aware about it lagging?
---
I usually see the spinning logo like its thinking for about 3-5 seconds then displays nothing...
---
I am assuming this is not what your talking about.. I should give it a good 10 minutes and keep looking at scorchbeast's inventory?
---
I agree. The lonely atmosphere is wonderful to me.
---
I didn't like spawning underwater when I travel to my camp, so I moved and switched to the small ground purifier that only makes 2 at a time, and most of that goes towards diluting stimpaks. I could build a bunch of extra purifiers but didn't want to.
---
I wonder if the dirty water pump cooldown is on the character or per-pump. If the cooldown is per-pump I could just build like 4 pumps and hit them in sequence to get water 4x faster.
---
It's hilarious that [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aew9rr/legendary_hunting_rifle_dropped_after_patch/eduhcw1) is right above yours right now.      
---
(at least for me, sort for best)
---
I tried leaving and re-joining the server last night and it did not work, but closing the client altogether and re-loading seemed to free up my budget again.
---
Many thanks.
---
That's interesting. I've never seen anyone experience that, including myself. Like I said its been fine for me so idk if that issue is around or fixed 
---
*Waves severed arm from PS4*
---
Good luck out there, brethren!
---
I want to be able to trap people in my house with a hundred radios blasting
---
Oh that would make sense. I've used rank 1 for a while and decided to go rank 2 after the patch so I thought it was the new patch that might've broke it. Guess I'll go back to rank 1 for now
---
Apparently people duping stuff and having unlimited carry weight affecting the servers is also BS. Now that it's been fixed (idk was it?) I'm getting more disconnects than ever. Game hasn't improved much since beta.
---
Yep, I got disconnected twice in 15 minutes. FO76 is still barely beta quality. 
---
*NOT. U S !*
---
ok cool .. 
---
Perks help too. Putting on White Knight to repair armor is a god-tier perk. Even if it's just to do the repairs and not keep on for the condition reduction.
---
I get what you're saying here, but you're clearly not managing your inventory right if both your STASH is full and your character is over weight.   
---
You have to be ruthless and decide what you absolutely need, and then ditch the rest.  
---
If you haven't used a weapon or armor piece in 3 game sessions, dump it, sell it, or give it away.
---
Figure out how many stimpacks and chems you actually need to keep for emergencies, then get rid of the rest.
---
Figure out a mad number of items for junk items that you use, then get rid of the rest.
---
BE FUCKING RUTHLESS. 
---
The only time I'm dangerously overweight any more is right after a WS nuke, because I've looted everything so I can then sort through it. Good luck.
---
Yeah I could do this till armageddon.  Stalemate it is.
---
It’s not funny, and the tens of downvoted won’t change my mind!
---
Yes, very snarky. Only because your "pretty solid evidence" was anything but.
---
I used rank 1 and it procs pretty consistently, but turns out rank 2 is basically broken
---
What platform?
---
It's a standard tactic to tag enemies in that area as they spawn a lot, they don't do a huge amount of damage but it helps the owner get more loot as any enemy the turrets hit will drop that player loot upon death even if someone storms in and TSE everything in sight.
---
I've had some hate on this myself as people think instead their kills, you can't steal kills and the turrets just allow the owner to get loot. If they were Missile Turrets then that's a different matter as those things are quite OP and will kill everything.
---
Well I wouldn't have said it if it wasn't the other side of the story. I'm not even a defender I'm simply driven mad by runaway bandwagons. Especially after seeing it happen to sea of thieves. At least the outrage with Bethesda was overdue, instead of an over reaction like with SoT. 
---
Anyways I claim it for a reason. None of it is "wrong" unless it challenges a pre established opinion I guess. 
---
For example the launch was par for the course with any other always online modern multiplayer game. Look at how long rainbow 6 was plagued with server disconnects, poor hit registration, and general instability. They released DLC called **operation health** trying to address all of it years later and that's just 1 AAA online game with a buggy launch. 
---
You have the recent World at War which was plagued with server drops and buggy stability when it launched too. It was a AAA COD game lol Goes without saying but also Sea of Thieves who had flying ships, server errors, and a glitched out tutorial. Battlefield 4 gets a fat mention for having a hugely fucked launch btw and that was early in this console generation too! 
---
Im thinking maybe fortnite was stable af? But that didn't release as battle royale day 1 with all the millions of players logging on that it has now. So idk.
---
Indie developers is a good call to omit. Though I would count it due to the likes of games like PUBG and Ark which launched officially on Xbox as part of an official xbox partner program. Not because I'm equating them to AAA games but because they're part of the industry.
---
If you've had a pulse in the last decade you'll have noticed how commonplace weak launches have become. Weak game$ even! So expecting ***bethesdas*** first online multiplayer game to be a stable always online experience on launch... Is insanity!
---
The launch was *okay*. It only becomes bad when your opinion becomes, well opinionated. When people expected fallout 5 or expected fallout:world of Warcraft by blizzard... Well then I totally understand how the game was a terrible piece of shit
---
Again, since tod Howard walked out to announce 76 like it was a rock concert... I have never expected more than fallout 4: online by bugthesda. They tried to make it seem like more than an in-between game jam release and their marketing helped them achieve it tbh. Because there were plenty of huge red flags to temper expectations way before even the beta. If you couldn't look past the country roads meme to see bethesdas follow-up to fallout 4 ($eason pass, weak direction, introduction of premium currency ffs) then idk what to tell ya. Wub u lub u dub dub anyone?
---
It isn't dramatically more buggy. That's the youtuber influence talking! It's proportionally more buggy. Since ya know the game was blown up to be 4x larger, 16x more detailed, terrain geometry improvements, lighting improvements, dynamic weather, improved render distances, blah blah blah. 
---
Fallout became unquestionably bigger. It was it's first time always online. The bugs and instability was about what I expected Fallout 76 by bugthesda to be. Yeah fallout 4 was polished like a tent pole release vs 76 that was polished like the multiplayer spinoff in between tentpoles that it is!
---
Please note my tone is not combative or anything I enjoy the discussion! I am curious are you on PC?
---
I've noticed PC players either having the most problems or being the most vocal. Idk if that's because they're the most vulnerable to instability due to all the variability of gaming PCs or if it's because they're a simple alt-tab away from voicing their opinions on reddit. Nothing against PC players ffs, I speak from experience when I say it's a very pampered platform. I'm not surprised 76 is getting hammered for not performing on 1337 PCs. Again nothing against PC it's just apparent that Bethesda performs differently on different platforms (ps4 Skyrim anyone?) I would imagine ever since Bethesda got hooked to console sales (specifically Xbox) that all their behind the scenes development hasn't been building fallout 76 to run best on PC ya know!
---
Yup I had to wait around 2 weeks for a response.
---
World full smh
---
&gt; "I KNOW! I know... But it's my story, and..."
---
I can confirm that this is the case as when I've looked it up in Fo76edit it only had just one leveled list and a container entry liked to the dev room.
---
"You're listening to Enclave Radio. I'm John Henry Eden, President of the Enclave, President of America, President... of your heart."
---
yeah i can see youre at the menu still, ill wait for you to drop in and then ill launch it. 
---
Is the jukebox not selectable left and right for different versions (like musical instruments)?
---
That's what I've been having to do, and it's a pain in the ass. Gonna have to disassemble parts of my build to get things into place.
---
I finally found him but before i could trade with him some idiot killed him!!
---
In my limited experience it is applicable to most everything. 
---
It is more of a DR penetration then armor. Super Mutants, Robots have Armor/High DR and it is effective against both.
---
Thanks for the invite but i'm on PC.  Have fun!
---
No, but it's polite to say thank you, and it costs nothing. 
---
Thanks, that did help me figure out what my main problem was. I don't know why you can basically embed the conduit in a floor, but suddenly a wall is too much of a barrier. Ugh.
---
Still not fixed from the looks of it - just yet more Radium Rifle plans from Wallace.
---
My early level black titanium farming was from mole miners, holy fuck do they give you a lot. 
---
Every online game has issues with hacking, cheating, and duping. That potential always exists, and you have to fight it.
---
The general procedure is:
---
* You find out that there are exploits (because there are always exploits).
---
* Internally it is figured out how the exploits worked, possible solutions.
---
* Game is patched, developers track the behavior of known exploiters.
---
* Ban wave occurs.
---
* Repeat.
---
This is something Valve does, Blizzard does, etc etc etc. For online multiplayer games. Because exploiters can cause problems and/or take advantage of *other players*. You know, other people who also purchased their games.
---
Your comparison Mario Bros. or the Konami code is off base because those only affect the person deciding to use those. It's the same reason no one cares if you use God mods in Fallout 3/NV/4. At worst you are ruining your own play experience. At worst for Bethesda you file some erroneous tech support issue that is not their fault.
---
The blame is not on Bethesda. The blame is on the dupers.
---
thank you, i sure will :) 
---
Thanks I just wanted a nice little farm there to make Cranberry Relish. If you holster the Tesla Rifle you also get a blue glow around your waist. The effects are kinda cool together. I don't know if other players see it but I seen it on mine.
---
Its only obtainable as of now from the dev room, same as the winterized armor and owl mask and all that.
---
I was so annoyed when I found out they were using the same engine for ES6!
---
—vrubg—   :)
---
Also, the few times I’ve used my Gatling plasma I’ve not seen this on PS4. 
---
Yeah, I'm going to have to tear apart portions of my build to fit things into it again. Frustrating, but eh.
---
Whats worse is that this is a level 15 alt, and I ran out of Copper trying to build the conduits.
---
I don’t agree with your definition of story. I’m not going to. Might as well just let it go. I love the story in this game. (:
---
You both have a hoarding problem. It's just pixels...drop that shit on the ground and go play the game.
---
Travel to Raleigh Clay’s bunker for Irrational Fear events.  You can see a somewhat consistent honeybeast (sometimes a Yao Guai) at the Red Rocket near the Seneca Visitor Center. 
---
Nope, you need to scrap the Marine Armor Helmet to get the recipe.
---
Really? And your claiming fake? 
---
So if I say, copy paste a picture of Hilary Clinton in a bathing suit (sorry for the mental, FBI dudes) and caption it, ‘We found out who Mohammed420blazeits mom is!’ And post it on imigur of all places, I suppose you’ll believe it huh? 
---
Why I recommend using the search engine. You’ll see multiple stories. But for the love of who ever you pray to, work on your reading comprehension. 
---
We’re done here. Good day. 
---
I got both addictions, but only since I was literally trying to so I drank like 6 various liquors, and took 5 buff outs. 
---
Btw this was because I had one of those legendaries that do increased damage with withdrawal symptoms. And was not worth it at all so I sold it.
---
I pick up a decent amount a whitespring, right side white springs near the road, on trees and all the way up and around to the top to that depot place with the super mutants, even across the road if they nuke the main area resin on trees. Also there are those small pods that give calbalt as well, quite a few on the right side. Start by the service entrance and work your way up and around. Violet is the only one that is rare at white springs.
---
Little known fact: turrets in fallout universe are programmed with a highly intelligent AI. Everyone you load into your base, there is a very very very small chance that a turret becomes self-aware. The turret hates that it is programmed to only destroy and never to create. The turret drives itself insane and does the only thing it can do, open fire.
---
Instigating fire axe is a good weapon though
---
Fucking oblivion! I played like 500+ hours and could never beat the main quest! The enemies at the oblivion gates were far too hard!
---
Yeah it's signs and letters. I got excited seeing it in a vendor for the first time but then I saw the price. Fucking outrageous. 
---
The river that runs north south on the west side of northwest flatwoods, you can find Snaptail reed. You can make sugar with those. Always carry like 50 sugar so you can get overencombered and run through the abnormally.

If Bethesda gave one fuck, the following conversation would never have happened:
---
&gt;"Hey you know how the game 'saves' every five minutes or so, so a random disconnect will roll the player back to five minutes ago?"
---
&gt;"Yeah?"
---
&gt;"Wouldn't that be hugely exploitable regarding putting shit in containers then lagging yourself out to duplicate items?"
---
&gt;&lt;massive bong rip&gt; "wat?"

---
If he has an exploding rifle, I'ma guess he has some decent investment
---
That’s if they allow you to tear it down even - my latest camp I had to move it/place again if I made a wrong move.
---
Or, don't build your base on a spawn point. I moved my base on the second day to a different puddle 50 yards further. Hardly ever an issue after that. 
---
What is a lot, there is more than you might think. Sure there is not as much as yellowcake, but that is to be expected, I picked up at least 42 during my last run of calbalt if not more, could of been closer to 60.
---
Can I get in on this? Speed Demon and Marsupial are what I really want. Got caps if you are willing 
---
Yeah, as far as I know, all high-level enemies also have high DR.
---
Tank Killer is probably less useful if you're using explosive weapons, as the explosion part ignores damage resistance anyway. Better to just max out the damage unless you need the staggers.
---
Gotcha. Never seen one of em. Lol
---
Roughly anyone not using heavy weapons can do max damage at about 40 cuz by that point you have all the perks you need, then its just an issue of gear. The only thing levels indicate is play time and that has a good correlation with ammount of good legendaries obtained. But low lvls can buy shit or have high lvl friends that give em op hand me downs. So meh.
---
But if your a heavy gunner use a gatling gun. The damage is decent given its rate of fire and you won't be eating through rounds. You'll also be repairing less often which is good. The high alpha damage also stacks well with perks since its a % increase. The bigger the initial number the bigger the increase. 
---
9/10 you'll be in power armour cuz of the armour pen perk so rejoice you don't have to go farming for legendary armour!
---
At a minimum all you really need to go fishing for is a armour pen or two shot gat. 
---
Then just stock up on drugs and bobble heads and a few mutations and you'll be at roughly 400 damage per shot. 
---
Happy hunting!

My camp sits to the east of Whitesprings, and I make it a daily task to head up the road to that sentry bot and introduce him to my sledge. Free fusion core for the session and I get the satisfaction of bashing robots to death.

---
How do we get in? I'd love to know . Pm please.
---
$60 game guys. Just ignore the crashes and bugs and just listen to the fanboys. The game is perfect. 
---
It seems to be a trend among developers at the moment.
---
Releasing unfinished titles with a total disregard of the player base and their feelings. Had Bethesda held the release until the game was finished they would have avoided a lot of the shit storm that accompanied it, however some of the reaction of the so called gaming experts on social media has been nothing short of disgusting.

The hunt for youtube views in the form of controversy from gaming content creators is as bad as the corporate monster infecting publishing companys.

My camp sits to the east of Whitesprings, and I make it a daily task to head up the road to that sentry bot and introduce him to my sledge. Free fusion core for the session and I get the satisfaction of bashing robots to death.
---
Meet Grahm a lot there too, seems he loves to patrol that road heading south from the Top of the World.

Golf club during a nuke zone, preferably with nobody stealing kills

I've heard a lot of whining like this through the years on game forums. Especially about the Darkzone in The Division. "QQ this is hard, you can't solo whine whine whine whine". A lot of the complaints, especially about soloing, always come back to age old gaming proverb. 
---
git gud
---
desperate "solution" when a dev releases a game that is far from finished.  real shame.
---
I honestly prefer the fallout 3 way, you equip the grenades like a weapon instead of how they are now.
---
Would be much less of a headache. 
---
Yeah it really angers me that i can have 700+ radiation res and a gasmask and still take 15  
---
\+ rads in a nuke zone, but with a power armor helmet and 400 rad res i take less than 1. WTF is that about?
---
I'm pretty certain the point of Fallout 76 is that it'll never be "finished."
---
Si
---
Thanks, I don’t know much about mutations, any you would recommend assuming I’m in PA  and using a Gatling gun?
---
DR/ER? what is that?
---
Its shit and to far gone to make a come back.
---
I'd be down

My group RP as raiders. We've all settled around pleasant valley train station on PS4. Beside us I've only ran into one other RP group. They were brotherhood. 
---
One problem  is it's hard to find another group of RPers to be pitted against. We would gladly welcome raids on our settlement if there was a way to flag ourselves. 
---
The other problem is no one seems to use area chat. It's hard to RP with people who can't hear you haha. 
---
&gt; Hello Dave ... I have another ... "problem" ... we need your particular ... "skill set" ... to resolve.

---
Let's say I have 1 Bulk Adhesive and 473 Loose Screws. If I sort by weight, the Bulk Adhesive will be towards the top and the screws will likely be off the screen even though they account for nearly 15 lbs of my stash.
---
Additionally, I'd like to open my Stash and see that I have 153 lbs of Junk, 15 lbs of Apparel, etc just by looking at the tabs across the top.
---
Yeeeeeah. SBQ is where I got my two serum recipes.

The world building in this game wins more points then just 3/10. Angry Joe focused 100% on only the bad when giving his review. The godrays in this game look amazing but he only showed the godrays through the fucking ground part. The AI of mobs might be broken as hell but it does win some points for mobs running and hiding behind trees if you try to make yourself unreachable from them. Game might not have Human NPC but it does have cute snd funny robots who want to sell you sharp bits to stab people with. Beats talking to ugly throat cancer no nose mutants and Preston. Human NPC's are useless after you finish the main story and multiplayers are all about the endgame. You don't need anything other then vendors. I really don't get the robot hate, synths would be rolling in their grave if they saw the backlash. There are a lot of good aspects to the game that for some weird reason don't win any points in those reviews. Power armors with jetpack are cool as hell, mutations are super interesting, explosions in this game are awesome, nukes are the coolest thing you can implement in a game and everyone can do it. Are none of the possitives worth anything?

Ship bilge?

Yep.  The game is legitimately good.  Have sour grapes about bugs if you have to, but I still log in and play several times a week. 
---
Yes yes, the game is this. So many time people are frustrate with the farm and the farm this and thet. When you jus play that's when it all come together. You spen so much time on farm and get legends but you forget one thing. To use the legends
---
Ahhhh, I gotcha now. I'd have to agree.
---
 I believe that's been nerfed a bit.
---
My favorite was I just killed the Charleston Grafton monster...I was looking at the loot on it and my friend fast traveled to me.  It jumped up and was alive again.  LOL.  Ummm...shouldnt their be a dead one and a live one?  It resurrected! 
---
The laser grid turns blue, so I think that will work! I don't have any friends up to that part of the quest yet.  Looks like I've got to encourage them to play more. 
---
Thanks for replying!
---
Okay but every post is "this game couldnt be better!" And the guy was voicing a concern that we shouldnt be so ignorant, even if it is blissful
---
Mine is usually so crammed to the right of the page you almost miss the first letter of each line. Kinda annoying. 
---
For all your talk about lazy people not clicking links... that image is directly from **yours** and OP's link.... It says Elder Scrolls Online.
---
You're an absolute genius.
---
Sorry you can't run around with infinite ammo endlessly one-shotting everything, bro. JFC, these games are about the grind.
---
Found Bethesda 
---
I’ve never had an issue with it.
---
Don't judge. It was either this or Wal-Mart greeter.
---
I struggled w/excavator quest as well. Here’s your helpful heloise tip, go to gorge junkyard farm black titanium there, use the PA station to assemble and install excavator parts, then go to garrahan and register the PA.
---
You can mug miners as well and scrap their gear for black titanium but, it’s just easier doing gorge. 
---
Happy hunting 
---
I'd just exit the game.   No time for player trap nonsense.  Good on you for using creativity, but when backed into a corner I'll do whatever I can to make sure you don't get the satisfaction.   ;p
---
&gt; I honestly feel like some one higher up told the developers that they needed the game finished before the holiday season, even though the devs knew it wouldn't be ready by then.
---
And this should be punished. Good job reddit.
