Never really had that bug. Super duper doesn‚Äôt dupe every time but it‚Äôs otherwise working for me
---
---
---
It's this. Without a doubt. Sometimes it doesnt even show the animation until you back out.
---
How would this be a new command centre for the Minutemen when they either haven't existed for hundreds of years or are yet to exist for another hundred years?
---
What I had meant to say in the post is that the stash limit was the only one I openly complained about. The server stability has been - **and still is** - unforgivably broken.
---
I don‚Äôt have any.  I keep a marsupial one with in case I need to jump high.  But only used it for blow the train whistle.  
---

---
What would the best mutation be for a rifle user?
---
Coincidentally, my CAMP is next to a permanent, hostile level 91 Deathclaw spawn. I have it set up so that the CAMP turrets will kill the Deathclaw without the Deathclaw being able to do any damage to the CAMP.
---
My "rogue" turrets are always the Shotgun turrets. The Missile turrets blow them up before they can do any damage.
---
 It never was bugged
---
I‚Äôve had this deathclaw for a while and a few before him and his ‚Äúquake‚Äù function never did that before just recently.
---
Good luck!
---
How does one even get wood armour?  I got the plan for the mod but never the armour.
---
Lol. Are you at thunder mountain substation TM-02?
---
They expect that their "loyalty" will get rewarded.
---
I was thinking just click on the sign and a dialog box would pop up, but only for the owner. Like the display cases work. ü§î
---
I was semi-expecting something of this nature around the 1 year anniversary.  I‚Äôm generally ambivalent to the small crises, because I‚Äôve been playing mmo/online games since before some players were born, but BGS really did miss a community building opportunity there.
---
Even if you didn‚Äôt get in on day one, seeing veterans wearing exclusive cosmetics kinda encourages you to stick around for the next year‚Äôs anniversary gift.  At least, I always had that in the back of my mind while playing any number of games that celebrate anniversaries.  Almost every online game I‚Äôve had a long term relationship has had dark times where you couldn‚Äôt see a light at the end of the tunnel.
---
The game is young yet, so there‚Äôs plenty of time for anniversaries to be celebrated.  If nothing else, the folks behind 76 are keenly aware of their players‚Äô thoughts, and tend to correct for mistakes when they can.  Using the first Fastnacht for example, they took our advice with Meat Week and Mischief Night.  They did the same for V94 raids, considerably improving ammo scrap rewards enough to make a f/ffr 50cal an acceptable choice as a primary weapon.  I can do a quick novice solo once a day, collect the three legendaries, and wind up with enough scrap to make a surplus of ammo.
---
Blocker. Reduce melee damage taken by 45% while you blast the enemy in the face.
---
I don‚Äôt believe you can get container rewards but so often.  If I do 3 in quick succession I get 1 then nothing so perhaps it‚Äôs tied to the 120/60 for looting overworld items and containers.
---
That...is the most amazing thing I‚Äôve seen all day!
---

Awesome thanks for sharing
---
 Or if somebody blows it to pieces with bloody mess
---
&gt; 1 int?
---
typical base 5 INT (for max makeshift/gunsmith) then -4 from Marsupial.
---
To get INT 38:
---
+4 supressing my five base mutations (so back to base 5 INT)
---
+20 UNY+INT full set 
---
+6 Egg Head (I only use it for this)
---
+5 Berry mentats
---
+2 Bobblehead INT
---
+2 Brain Fungus Soup (sub-optimal, but easy to get)
---
That should be 40 INT, but UI shows 38 INT, no idea why.
---
No worries Christmas event will give this plan üëåüèΩ
---
After this post i tried myself as i've always carried tenderizer 1.  
---
I crippled a behemoth so that distance wouldn't have had an influence. 
---
Can confirm that all the shots after the first were within 5 seconds ,but none of them were higher than the first(at least not on numbers).
---
Could it be that it's another one of those cases were the displayed number don't reflect the actual damage? Like furious iirc.
---
I can all but guarantee that if they ever add this it will be atom shop or FO1st only. They are done with giving us convenience for free.
---
with high enough luck you can refill your crit bar every other shot assuming you use crit savvy.  Personally I would run a luck tree like this:  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=111111f&amp;d=lu2lv2lk2lt2l10l71&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=111111f&amp;d=lu2lv2lk2lt2l10l71&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=)   
---
That will refill a crit every 3rd shot, to get it to every other shot you just need some bonuses to luck.
---
Oh really oops. My bad. So deathclaw gauntlet mole miner gauntlet etc counts only as one handed?
---
It‚Äôs frustrating to fight a three star legendary enemy and they fly into the abyss
---
Use the Neon Letters, bro. "Armor/Weapon Crafting Upon Request" would only take up 31% of your budget. "Message 4 Armor/Wpn Crafting" would be 25%.
---
They use up a lot of budget because they're lights, which take a lot of processing power.
---
Just putting dense mod on chest will alone pretty much keep you from killing yourself with explosive rounds.  This will save you from using perk cards for fireproof.  When building out perk selection always keep in mind does it help me kill or does it help protect me.  It should generally be either of those with few exceptions.  Most other perks can be swapped as needed while not in combat.
---
Are the free items something that returns?  If not those would be an indicator of veteran and faithful status.  Those items should never be repeated and shouldn‚Äôt always seem to be the least likable version of its type
---
It really is
---
Or how about corpses are highlighted in vats? Not targeted, but will glow so you can see them
---
I was reading your post about straight talk hotspot problems and was going to comment but the post was archived. If you still have st and need some help connecting here's a few tips. Hope this helps! 
---
Download Pdanet there's a few ways to set it up, if you need steps just YouTube a video. Games kinda lag like cod, but you can connect. Videos stream decent and some games do too. If you don't want to pay for the full version download Pdanet in the app store. Then download aptoide and search for FoxFi key for Pdanet. Good luck! My hotspot also stopped working, ocasionally it will work once in awhile (not sure how or why...) but as soon as I turn it on and get it working the moment I turn it off they block it again.
---
This is asked weekly. I doubt they‚Äôre ever gonna do anything about this unfortunately.
---
Yes you are, but i guess there have mods for it
---
Or just ducking give us in game chat
---
For this account..maybe 1~2 weeks. Its funny though
---
I did.  Fricking wood walls are depressing
---
Aww
---
Hmm, I don't think there are any phantom budget issues going on right now. Can't say for certain cause sometimes the bugs can be pretty random, but I haven't heard of any such problems in recent months.
---
As to the gap floor idea, it could work! Haven't tried it myself. My initial concern would be how it looks from below (if there is such a vantage point), but otherwise it might actually save you a decent bit of budget. Assuming you're creating a fairly large floor.
---
At this point they should just implement one of the PC mods to make stuff glow.
---
I can take out level 68 mutants when stealthing with one shot on the body. Its great
---
Wait, they gave out free stuff at the beginning? Why didn't I know about this?!?!
---
Thanks for introducing me to this. Good stuff. Keep up the great work.
---
Before tax. For here in Ontario it's $0.13 on every dollar. When I say we are still talking dollars it is because we are. Without trying to buy just the game then the fact is one is clearly cheaper because the only difference is the price it says which in America is 39 dollars with a 5 or 6% tax on top in Michigan then here in Canada it is 59 dollars with a 13% tax on top in Ontario. 
---
Both are dollars, both have a different tax percentage that's it. Just looking you can tell the game is being charged less in the states than in Canada. 
---
This was not about the exchange rate. It's about how the same game will be sold for less in America than in Canada both in starting price and sales tax. Right now the difference is insane since a new a new game after tax here is little over $90. 
---
I won't be surprised if it reaches $100 for a standard edition game but at that point I'll only buy games on sale.
---
start at hemlock 2 snally, 1 grafton monster,  dolly sods 2 yoa gui, larry toxic 3 snally, then tanagra town crave crickets 6+, also will check out lucky hole mine sometimes crickets will spawn there as well
---
It would at least be nice to have a Christmas radio and radio station.
---
Hopefully they don't wait until its already Christmas for this year's holiday bundles to come out.
---
Raider and Mr fuzzy themed Christmas stuff would be an interesting touch too
---
I don‚Äôt know if this was said but I think that purchasing fallout first makes the game unplayable without it. As a broke college student, I‚Äôd rather not spend the money and just not get the perks rather than buying them for a month and then getting frustrated that my stash is always full.
---
If you buy it, it‚Äôs something you need to keep playing so I‚Äôm just avoiding it.

Eh, I just get these random moods to play a type of game. Rn I'm into Fallout so I was wondering if it was worth it
---
Would be very useful for One Violent Night
---
Blackbird power armor paint. Anyone who has it is confirmed og.
---
I love listening to CHAD, and looking forward to the robert house episode, whoever you get
---
Should get a marker for everything. But I know it will tax the servers seeing how things are now.
---
tryin to get radium rifle and ultracite weapons myself, maybe even the gatling laser
---
I see your point but its not that, I've had this excavator for almost a year,  in the stats on the pipboy it as always said 200 (100 full set + 50 √ó 2 calibrated shocks) since the paint job the pipboy says 100
---
Once you have wallpaper up, the items won't be removed if you change wallpapers.
---
I dont have vendors, i have been seeing some unusual names for things lately. They cant change legendaries can they, say its a vanguard and they change it to unyielding? Either way im taking ur advice and will bring up the pick which shows the whole thing. Thanks for the info.
---
Is that in your own vendor?  If so I am pretty sure only you see that.
---
Sounds good to me. One of my other team mates runs a bloodied build in the vault and he survives ok.
---
If you have any other questions,let me know otherwise I'll see you tomorrow morning
---
Currently the best workaround I've found for this is taking out your camera and walking around with it aimed at your recent killing area.
---
Hrmm... have you tried stripping off the paint job?
---
That's how it should be. Are you Xbox by any chance?
---
Yea that‚Äôs what I got, the plan for T-60 military.
---
A tip if you put a * before the name they will always be at the top of your armor list for easy grab and deploy
---
I have, no luck still at 100
---
Runescape has all those account age rewards, titles, capes. I'd be happy with something like a 1, 3 and 5 year milestones as people get those numbers. Playtime number rewards would also be good sometimes levels don't accurately represent playtime my main is like 106 but my total level if I didn't make so many alts would be over 500.
---
I wonder the same thing. Unless its bloodied im not exactly sure.
---
I am for this and I know those who I normally play with are for this. Even just a section that says 'Legendaries' so you could talley the weapons and armor and see if it adds up. 
---
Also, the last paragraph, I really hope people wouldnt take it like you were telling them where to camp. Sad if they do it wasnt the point of the post at all.
---
I am, my user name is my GT
---
That‚Äôs pretty much how i waste my caps in the wasteland. Traveling across the map 30 caps a pop then i see the first item is a alien blaster at 10000 caps my heart just sinks. On average one purchase out of 20 travels, most of the time it‚Äôs junk or fusion core.
---
Any time this happens to me, I curse myself for thinking there was something actually there. :{
---
That‚Äôs your vendor
---
Use a boatfly syringer... Unlimited acid as long as you have syringes.
---
If they could somehow show howany legendaries are for sale, that would be great.  I have 1 toon, 43 weapons, 36 armors, all legendaries, almost all 3 star (except for a few 2 and 1 stars with bloody, Junkie's, unyielding, and such) a sign that says pm offers and stuff doesn't move.
---
It's Christmas time, people should be stocking up!!!
---
Yea I remember when they use to a lot more. It would have been nearly impossible to have 8 back then. Still having 8 now can eat into a budget and holds me back on what I build if I want turrets. This last build I decided to just put my camp in a low level area and not have any turrets. I still wish I had turrets though. Also if it had to do with preformance then why do some turrets take more budget than others? For example if you build the early tier machine gun turrets they take up quite a bit less space than rocket turrets. You would think 8 turrets is 8 turrets.
---
 Another thing Bethesda says on the fallout 1st advertisement page on their website that larger camp budgets are in the future for fallout first members. I am wondering if larger build sizes only apply to the private servers? You'd think not because I'm not sure how it would work if it did.
---
Look under tables for the Mothman wooden carved side table thing (below the wirespool table) and then scroll across and it's there.
---
...having White Springs, Violent Night, and Uranium Fever to yourself? Yeah. That.
---
A lot of people bought the other items I'm talking about that people complain aren't free (fridge, scraptron, F01st, repair kits, etc) this (the bungalow) is not significant in terms of your free DLC idea. You cant compare a simple instanced room with an entire DLC package and say they are the same. NPC's, missions, new gear, weapons, scripts, enemies, locations=wastelanders. An instanced room in whitesprings=bungalow idea. They are nothing alike, and no, not everything should be a free, give me, give me, like some people think.
---
I really don't understand that mindset. If i want something in the real world, I buy it, I dont expect that company to just give it to me. I don't walk into McDonalds and demand a burger, fries and a drink but then only pay for the burger. If I dont want it or can't afford it, then I just don't buy it, it's not a hard concept. I don't demand that a company not sell something because I, the single consumer, dont want it/can't afford it. That seems way backwards. 
---
This bungalow, would at best, be described as a minor utility option. A small single room that has limited build/ no build space? If you don't want it, then don't buy it, but constantly demanding every add on as free seems counterproductive. They are a company, a business, ran to make a profit. They are not your friend, they are not a charity, and they offer items for sale like any other company the only difference being the items are virtual rather than physical. 
---
A number of gaming companies are moving away from the large chunk DLCs because it more profitable to sell tiny microtransactions then large time consuming DLC. In a study, 77 percent of polled gamers found microtransactions beneficial in extending game play for there enjoyed game. Of the group polled, 23 percent said they had recently purchased a microtransaction vs only 16 percent said they purchased dlc. Makes sense. In the last 90 days, I've bought 1 DLC for a game ($15) vs 6 Microtransactions ($30). People buy more items when they are sold more frequently for less money. You get your free wastelanders *because* of the other misc crap they sell. I don't care what they originally promised, a company is not going to continue to fund and develop content for a dead/unprofitable game.
---
https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dlc-and-microtransactions-new-study-shows-how-game/1100-6444522/
---
These numbers make sense, because that's what I've seen with at least the first month of F01st. People bought it. A lot. Sure, there were a super vocal group who preached fire and brimstone, but the numbers don't lie. People bought it. And they will keep buying things they like. If I want to purchase something from a company and I like the product, who are you to tell me I shouldn't buy it or that it shouldn't be for sale? These kind of things are exactly what the Atom Shop was meant for. Non essential, supplemental, options.
---
I'm down to help, relitivly experienced vault raider (have my full pa set n 3 pieces of normal)
---
I'm in sun, Mon, Tues from 2200 tp 0800 gmt (UK)
---
I'm sorry, what?
---
You get a little bit of acid
---
I had the impression that was under control from Bethesda.  There has been no new mass items from what I have seen recently.  No youtube duping method, thank goodness. No mass crashes of the servers, again, thank goodness. I am not naive,  but things do seem better.
---
Worth it. Events that often get crowded with folks on public server
---
Bethesda shit the bed when they decided to allow players to trade legendary items.  A lot of other online games don't allow anything like that specifically to remove any benefit to duping.
---
It would take 5 seconds for the abuse to be so bad that either no one would use them or Bethesda would have to remove them.
---
Oooo maybe that can be another 1st perk
---
Literally nobody would use the word 'ducking' in the in-game chat, which is exactly why we DONT have it.
---
Thanks i put it in there twice...lol
---
Oh
---
Larger camp sizes are on the way for fallout first members according to the website. I think if you quit paying you just wouldn't be able to add to or move your camp as is without an active membership.
---
I gave my level 5 alt serums and then I share starched genes when she needs a rad shower or radaway. Also means that stranger in numbers works when I'm running by myself while in a team with her.
---
We should team up and kill that Bastard's. Do you make your own ammo?
---
Vault 94, washout mission spawns a metric shit ton of crickets and bloodbugs.  Go in on novice and just farm, 500+ acid per player in one pass.  Rinse and repeat if you need thousands of acid, no need to even server hop.
---
Even if it‚Äôs under control the market will have a hard time recovering from the counterfeit machine running so long.
---
Very good point.
---
Yes they did announce a DLC. You must have missed the announcement. Its scheduled to come up the first quarter of 2020. It's call wastelanders. 
---
https://youtu.be/R2XdwS4lcZM
---
exactly what the perk says, 75% reduction in penalty.  So something that say, gives a -4 str penalty is reduced to -1.
---
At the least all my characters have carnivore, speed demon, and marsupial.  Bird bones if they need AP for anything, and eagle eye if I care about crits.  From there its user preference and build specific.
---
I can do a spot on Valentine impression. MSG me if you ever need that.
---
it's a blast during public events, telling people 'pay no attention to the synth detective' and 'say pal, can ya spare a bit of water for an old gumshoe?'
---
QUESTION: where do you find the mask you have to wear? Never completed this, level 183
---
I was told there would be no math..
---
derp
---
If you‚Äôre on PC they were recently mass duped and given away by the thousands, making them pretty much worthless
---
I would estimate that there is a greater total value of duped items than legit items. Imagine an economy where most of the bills were counterfeit.
---
hmmm, I was in doubt, but the bonus from Egg Head shows in the pip-boy, so I asumed it was working for real. I will put extra atenttion on this the next time I run a "high INT sesion".
---
You'll need strange in numbers [when it's not bugging out and doing the opposite] and class freak to make the most of the mutation buffs and debuffs!
---
This is awesome, I love it
---
If you see a cave cricket horde event you can keep the horde boss alive and farm waves of crickets. They keep spawning until the horde leader is dead.
---
I just started over myself. Man have things changed. I was always upset because id rush to do something as soon as it dropped because i was endgame and foaming at the mouth fir any kind of content. So when i finished it, it was usually before it ever got fixed. So the game was in a perpetual state of being broken and unenjoyable for me.
---
Having started over like i said earlier, everything is much smoother and streamlined. I feel almost like its a new game. 
---
I reccomend starting over to anyone thats stuck where i was with this game. Its a breath of fresh air.
---
Things aren‚Äôt really adding up once one starts to dig , but it begs the question as to why spend resources on making/buying new serums, and time investment into acquiring a full uny/int suit, for the purpose of something not particularly important that can be gained through other means?  Or in a worst case scenario, you sacrifice some int to maintain a normal bloody build hovering around low 20s, eat some scorchbeast brains, huff some Daddy-O you found in a random bin, craft your brains out with super duper and learn mods at a slightly lower rate.  
---
None of this makes sense to me, but it does a lot to turn new, impressionable players off to crafting wholesale.  If they think it requires hundreds of hours to learn basic armor mods, why even try?  It‚Äôs misleading, because most can be bought by visiting robot vendors and simply spending caps on the plan or one-off mod.
---
Create a temporary blueprint named !Test or something to that effect. 
---
That will appear on the top of the blueprint menu in your workshop menu. 
---
Using this you can highlight a create a quick template of everything on the wall, (without the wall) and immediately put it back once the new wall paper is on.
---
This is also useful if your wanting to see how different wall paper looks with different decisions.
---
Overwrite that same blueprint each time you change a wall, only takes 5 seconds to put your stuff back.
---
well first, it will be a subscription, no doubt about it. Probably call it something typically uninspiring like "Fallout Firstest" and it will be outrageously overpriced at around $49.99 a month in keeping with Bethesda's complete tone-deafness around what the market will bear and what the typical player can reasonably afford.
---
I have zero mutations. Most of my friends have zero mutations. We are starting a BoS chapter that will disallow mutations for thematic reasons.
---
AMA
---
I never said everything should be free. Stop rambling.
---
I would say that the folks selling the duped items have been handled appropriately.  I agree that at one point the duped out weighed the in game drops, but I have some faith that in the last few months that Bethesda has gotten it under control.  Dam, I personally lost all kinds of junk with a 1st scrapbox, but according to there records I lost nothing..... a bit of sarcasm added in.... I completely understand what you are saying.
---
Or for those of us who use energy weapons; I've lost count of the number of times I've killed a legendary Scorchbeast, only to have it disintegrate/gooify whilst hurtling across a field, it's ashpile/puddle never to be found amongst the tall grass :/
---
Xbox. Plus it was a fairly low level. I think he just got lucky at UR and didn't know what he had. I dropped him 2 low level kinda badass leggies as compensation.
---
They give free stuff every week.
---
And we don't even have an in game bug reporting tool. Totally ridiculous
---
I never said everything should be free, stop rambling. I believe every player should have access to every inch of the map, instanced or not. Disagree all you want, but that crosses a line. They outlined their guiding principles a few weeks back around micro transactions and this would not conform to those guiding principles. So yes, I think it‚Äôs reasonable to expect any paid content to be in line with what they outlined a few weeks ago.
---
I literally stopped buying from the shop once I hit my max build budget. Im cancelling FO1st after the 2nd month because I now have thousands of atoms that I will likely never spend.
---
That's awesome!   I have to ask, if you know who built it, *HOW* on earth did they managed to get interior walls back to back with exterior walls of a different tileset?
---
If camp budget allowed, would it work to have 2 vendors, one powered with armor and weapons, one unpowered with others? Would it only display the powered vending machine stock on the map? Only asking coz at work and cannot try to see of could resolve...
---
Oh yeah. Lots of crystal. I tend to avoid it though.
---
I was thinking about to do this for ages, but with mules and limited storage it was going to be a pain to run. 
---
I forced 100% of the mods for the Handmade and for the Gauss (the two rifles I started to use), when the game was fresh and it was exhausting. 
---
Scrap-box arrival changed the situation...
---
See borderlands 3 and copy how they do it.
---
My favorite xmas song. That and The Night Santa Went Crazy
---
 Sounds like a plan and usually. I farm 556 and fusion cells at west tek when im farmin for legendaries. You can get em quick too.
---
+karma  Love the Discussion.  This is a great forum for it.
---
Make it like wow, loot one body and all bodies within the vicinity are loot pooled
---
Don‚Äôt worry. They‚Äôll add this as a payed feature. You guys really still support this game at this point?
---
Heh, had not thought about that, good idea.
---
What‚Äôs your gamertag I‚Äôll visit
---
Still, god to know.
---
I've been playing since beta and only just realised you have to actually "search" the body to get more meat, and likewise for the ammo boxes. I just assumed it was already included in what you loot. Not for it to be a seperate action on top
---
You‚Äôre like one of the people who think theyre cool because they have an ‚ÄúOg FoRtNiTe SkIn.‚Äù Sorry to burst your bubble, but nobody cares that you‚Äôve played the game since the start.
---
Thanks!  The challenge with duped is the same as with counterfeit currency. Lots of it ends up in innocent hands. The counterfeiters spend each fake bill 1 time but it could then pass through dozens or even hundreds of innocent hands.
---
No it doesnt...  at least it didnt a couple months ago when I was doing the challenges
---
Great work around but keep in mind it still isn‚Äôt highlighted, so it‚Äôs almost like a game of Marco Polo. It‚Äôs name is highlighted on top right when in camera zoom mode = your headed in the right direction. Disappeared and it‚Äôs fallen out of camera zoom field of view. Even with this trick I managed to lose one of two legendary kills I got the other day in scorchbeast country. But one is better then none
---
What about metal walls though
---
Announcement to everyone commenting, you aren‚Äôt cool because you have an exclusive/old atomic shop item, nobody cares that you‚Äôve played since the start
---
Would love the destiny mail system too for ‚Äúlost‚Äù loot or engrams not picked up
---
Yea I'm still learning new stuff and figuring things out. There isn't a lot of solid information out there. There needs to be a fallout 76 Mythbusters team.
---
I am not sure it does not show how poorly designed the games loot system is even more so.  I should feel like I have some sort of chance to get the equipment I want, those odds are depressing low.
---
I don't think I have ever hit 100 percent in any game, except maybe Reddit.
---
From a fellow lever fan. That is a pretty good price. I think you got a good deal.
---
Fully auto Anti-armor fast fire rate i believe is the best right now.
---
Your logic is the wrong way around.
---
Lots of people buy it because it is such an integral and gamechanging addition. They feel compelled to buy it because they have no choice. How many people buy Repair Kits, since Scorched Earth gives them? Bethesda forces people into buying them by intentionally making you have a bad experience if you don't. The Scrap Box is the proof of that.
---
Awesome tips! Thank you
---
&gt;You can store built items for 1 week at workshops. 
---
Is this added in a recent patch I missed?
---
Maybe Al could redo it to sound more era-appropriate? I mean, if their alternative timeline has all our songs already, it makes sense that at least some of the later hits still would have made it through to their 'verse. We pop vaults all time, maybe he's been sitting in one combating [VDS](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_depressive_syndrome) for a couple decades.
---
I would also love to see Copacabana. My husband checked, it's old enough, bouncy enough, and certainly depressing enough.
---
Camps like this put my hobo shack to shame. You spend hours toiling and getting the cosmetics right at your camp. then heading into the wastelands you see something like this and a demolition order gets placed against your shack. Haha
---
There could be a a counter argument for duping actually driving up market prices of other weapons.
---
Me too after trying it out for a bit.
---
Brilliant!
---
It appears to be their top import, and top export. Do they import uncut diamonds and the export cut diamonds? If so, do they own the mines that mine the diamonds or do they just buy them from other countries. Whatever happened to the Dutch diamond industry in south africa?
---
Getting the perfect load out should essentially be impossible based on the way the loot system works.
---
Well I was asking for reference as I dont know all the mutations and effects off hand. Im not the strongest super mutant..
---
Yea I second Hemlock Holes for sure. Lots of places to set up gathering machines plus snallygaster attacks are common.
---
That's cool.
---
GT JaggersLips13 ... with love. Xx
---
You mean, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs another C.A.M.P that needs our help‚Äù lol.
---
http://www.worldstopexports.com/diamond-imports-by-country/
---
Private message me with up to three reasons why. ;)
---
I don't know exact number or percent but I know that if you tamed scorchedbeast that you losing all budget - my friend done this few months ago
---
http://www.worldstopexports.com/diamond-exports-country/
---
Add a new Perk card, "Pip Boy Scan". Its automatically assigned at lvl 50 at no cost.
---
Assign it to the Favorites wheel and when in use, it will function like VATS, but only highlight corpses within a fixed radius of yourself.
---
Thank you for that. I‚Äôm thinking of just making a new character for PvP. It doesn‚Äôt sound like it‚Äôs fun to have one for both modes simultaneously
---
I rarely see valuable 1 offs but when I do they do have more value. Although someone with a mule full of god rolled duped can usually outbid whoever they want.
---
I get one or two empties, but the rest have stuff in 'em.
---
I think I remember reading it‚Äôs around that of a turret before I tamed my deathclaw. And who needs turrets with a deathclaw? Be prepared for the constant stomping noise they make and visitors always trying to shoot them.
---
Haven‚Äôt you heard? This gets you banned.
---
Some people are lazy, really. I guess players today want shopping in the Wasteland to be as easy and convenient as buying from Amazon. 
---
Think about it: you can fast travel, you can see the number of items, you can see categories and quantities... And no, it is not enough for some people. Next time they will ask for door to door service, buying without visiting the vending machine, directly from your Pipboy. 
---
You know this is a game about exploring and walking the Wasteland, right? Is your real life THAT easy?
---
There has been  no content added since Nuclear Winter. Only a $100 pay to win subscription.
---
It was there as part of an atom bundle purchase during some convension. It wasn't offered standalone iirc. Wouldn't count on it coming back for a while.
---
Didn‚Äôt Bethesda say they wouldn‚Äôt do pay to win?
---
&gt;Even just a section that says 'Legendaries' so you could talley the weapons and armor and see if it adds up. 
---
That doesn't matter. I can put 12 limb damage pipe wrenches and 21 nocturnal raider legs just for fun. 
---
It is a game. The game says you need to haul your add there and check the wares, and I think shopping is already easy enough.
---
I don't play RS actively anymore but in a few months my account will have earned the veteran cape for 15 years. I like to hop on few times a year and look at all the changes that's been made. Maybe even do a holiday event.
---
This. Only one of my characters is mutated. The rest are clean. Marsupial breaks immersion and feels stupid from a Fallout perspective. 
---
Eagle eyes and speed demon for a gunslinger are my limit. Everything else feels like a boost from Quake 2 or a blue magic spell from Final Fantasy 8.
---
Oh, you mean, Fort Defiance.
---
Really thats what u got out of what i wrote. Maybe u should think about not commenting if u have nothing actually beneficial to this conversation. Or are u a troll trying to make it into something its not just to get a rise out of people. Please leave comments that actually further the conversation not turn it into another conversation. I have been all over the map. Anywho good talk thanks for the comment that did not help anyone good job
---
Not going to help when with loot you find the paper bag before the marker.
---
I leave it in the free bag on the counter in my shop.
---
And you believed those fuckers?
---
Armor and Decon Showers?
---
Well if a company says something I kinda expect them to commit but i guess not
---
I definitely love it when I or someone else either has explosive ammo or uses a grenade so the body goes flllllying across the sky into the unknown.
---
Quad faster fire or anti-armor faster fire Tesla's and handmades or fixers are the Pvp meta as far as I know. 
---
Fallout 76 does not offer the greatest pvp experience and most of the time pvp specialists just collect sets of perfect armor and autotarget your ass with vats while stealthing or jumping like idiots. 
---
Not really a firefight.
---
Leave at train stations, overseer‚Äôs camp, or on corpse outside 76. I left 1000 .38 outside 76 a few weeks ago. I wish I could have seen the reaction from the lucky new player to find it
---
Things are in kind of quiet mode right now, given they had to push Wastelanders back to the New Year.  
---
Everything we would've gotten with that has been delayed thusly. They're still coming out with bug fixes kinda biweekly, and servers certainly seem to have stabilized.  
---
They've introduced a monthly subscription system you can find at:  [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/fallout1st](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/fallout1st)   
---
If it floats your boat: buy it. If it doesn't: don't. Doesn't really change much either way.  
---
Simply put, if you enjoyed things before, it's a fine time to come back. If you're lookin' for a real big change, that'll come some time in the first quarter of next year.
---
new code for this week is alt + f4
---
You could consider leaving in a suitcase or other container at a highly frequented train station. Or even outside of vault 76 in a nearby container for newbies.
---
What‚Äôs to be expected with wastelanders any new content revealed yet
---
Honestly? The YouTubers aren't far off.
---
For lead got to the fire breathers hq and the gym is full of weights
---
I took an old lvl 40 BFFR combat rifle and made it .38 for when I'm just out exploring and don't want to waste 5.56 on ads.
---
As in the game is a buggy mess?
---
It's good price. Might want to replace it with a bloodied equivalent, because Instigating does not do more damage than bloodied on that first and only shot. Weird, but that's how it goes.
---
No. Not for me at least.
---
Thanks!!
---
What do you play on?
---
NUKAWHALE is 100% cheater!!!!!! No doubt .
---
Unfortunately I don‚Äôt know him personally. We didn‚Äôt even speak just emoted at each other. I wish I could tell you how he did it but I‚Äôm not the savviest CAMP builder.
---
Xbox
---
Oh I play pc
---
I just bought about that many 5.56 rounds off someone (and a few .50 as well), if that was you...thank you for saving me all that lead farming!
---
Ash heap. Too bad there is 0 good content there
---
I feel that this is why Bethesda gave us nukes. ;)
---
You will get a lot of variability in responses from PC players because hardware can vary so much some say super smooth, others not so much
---
-crawls out from rock-
---
They said they are not, but who knows
---
Thats funny, too bad it is broadcasted otherwise it would be worth it sometimes. Just kidding
---
When? Witch inside the vault did they say that?
---
As in little to no bugfixes, pay-to-win mechanics being implemented at break-neck speed, false advertising in regards to the pay-to-win mechanics, and "customer service" that amounts to telling you they'll "look into it" and promptly deleting your claim ticket. 
---
The only reason I'll be giving Wastelanders a try is that I've already paid for the game, so I might as well try and salvage *something* from this. That said, I won't be at all surprised if Wastelanders ends up being a paid DLC expansion.
---
I don‚Äôt think they can make it paid because then some people might not have it then you have messed up friends lists and even more bugged games
---
That's not necessarily a good thing, you know.
---
I wish all bodies would glow or something...it's so hard to find bodies if they glitch or whatever. And even if they turn into gore piles, they're still hard to freaking find.
---
Define "suck". My gunslinger would kill 95 percent of the enemies in the game with one or two shots. Really fun. 
---
But you have people saying pistols and revolvers suck because you can go bloodied mutated unyielding unarmed and onepunch everything. 
---
Try this for fun: choose a film character who is good with a pistol and build it realistically. I had a Doc Holliday who was a pro drinker + triple benefits, high charisma, eagle eyes and speed demon, 1 endurance. A Sledge Hammer who only used his Somerset Special and a rocket launcher, low agility and low intelligence.
---
There is Collateral Tom Cruise, John Wick, Kingsman Pedro Pascal, etc.
---
Yes, and server stability and the overall user experience are *clearly* high priorities for Bethesda. /s
---
Seriously, if they see a chance to wring more money out of this game, they'll take it.
---
Mark corpses? yes or no?
---
Mark legendary corpses? yes or no?
---
Yeah I think that would about do it.
---
I think it was E3 or somesuch convention
---
Okay
---
Precisely. Allow u to find the loot you want pretty easy
---
Yeah it is nice when players spend those caps. U will always sell stuff if u stock good stuff at good prices. I dont do vending machines anymore because for me its easier to trade through the market since i deal in big items or larger quantities of things. Never liked having to always look over my shoulder keeping an eye on my caps. What did they buy was it one thing or a bunch of things?
---
Bro maybe he just doesn't think that this would be valuable use of dev time. Why are you so salty and taking it personal? Not everyone is going to agree with you dont cry about it. I on the other hand think it might be a decent idea to seperate certaint categories like legendaries
---
In regards to Wastelanders: we're getting NPCs again (Settlers and Raiders are the main two factions, with disparate groups like the Cult of the Mothman also showing up.)  
---
The interaction system'll be closer to Fallout 3, with your stats effecting outcomes. Evidently we'll get companions out of this, but they're apparently kind of gonna be locked to your camp; they've been a little fuzzy on the details, probably because they hadn't finalized it by the conference.  
---
There's gonna be new areas, new weapons/gear, places the factions have retaken and made their own as well as locations we'll have opened up.  
---
Apparently we'll be able to pan for gold, which is kind of neat but that's really vague (it shows up in the preview video but that's about it.)  
---
Supposedly it's a fundamental overhaul, fixing a bunch of outstanding bugs and issues that've plagued things for a while.   
---
The "Inside the Vault" link below was put up last week and shows some of the new areas/npcs.  
---
And while it's a bit dated, watching the Wastelanders trailer'll give you some idea of what's to come.  
---

---
I do imagine there is some element of balance (or attempt to balance) in there as well.  I know that the majority of players don‚Äôt PVP, but there are some, so it may make a difference there, or if nothing else in workshops.  
---
It is weird how some things take up more budget than others.  It‚Äôs better to just use the wires and connectors than conduits in my experience, and I‚Äôve heard using floors instead of a roof is better since the roof uses more budge. 
---
All that said, I have seen some amazing large bases that didn‚Äôt feel empty, so perhaps there are some work around similar to the old FO4 dropping items and then scrapping them.
---
That's where the +20 carry weight is coming from :)
---
Sound like dupes to me, if I'm brutally honest.
---
Doesnt work on Playstation  :-/
---
True but starting players that don‚Äôt realize how quickly your character will get addicted to chems or booze. Like for me one time I used a strength buff just to get to a trade bot at one of the stations in FO76 and got addicted to it
---
Remember that time passes when wastelanders comes out. So with your example, it would make sense. Time passes and people start to rebuild there.
---
Coulda been 8800 ifn it warn't for that gaddam guvment taxashun
---
I set up next to 76, and buisness has been booming. Mostly sell chem aid and food but my non legendary fixers, handmades, and lever guns have been selling much better after the move
---
Thanks I‚Äôll check it out
---
Well said mate. I've thousands of dollars in digital games I never play and you can't resell them..
---
 [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)  \-&gt; a good resource for this type of thing ;)
---
Nope only need to power one and shows all, i leave 3 unpowered just to save energy
---
I play roulette with them, toss the rounds in your atom shop fireplace and see where they fly
---
I usually run th 94 raid come out with around 500ish every time
---
Well everyone was dead, then you and the other vault dwellers took out a bunch of the scorched, found a vaccine for the disease, set up new scorched detectors, and helped a psychotic robot set up a radio station.  Everyone there was dead.  Now people are back. They may need to tweak a couple of roses lines, but everything from the overseer was from the past, so it‚Äôs fine.
---
Well its west Virginia so hillbilly roulette is acceptable
---
I always assume if it's that much "armor", most is clothing. Sometimes they end up having nice stuff because noone bothers spending 30 caps to go look lol
---
Nah it wasnt but i could imagine that being a hassel. Mine was a vampires explosive +10% damage while aiming combat shotgun for 6k and two other 1000 cap legendaries and 800 5.56 lol
---
Killed a 3 star scorchbeast during Line in the Sand that landed on the roof of Fort Defiance.   So frustrating.
---
r/iamverysmart
---
Nahh a shotty i had for 6k and two 1k items and like 800 5.56.. damn taxes
---
Im pretty sure im not salty or crying if i was it would be in all caps to get my point across. There are plenty of things the devs could do for this game this is one of many, all i am doing is pointing it out and trying to start a conversation about it. Never asked devs to drop everything they are doing and just work on this. Again i feel like maybe the whole thing is not being read. This is a conversation and would be nice if it was a constructive one thats it. Its not constructive to call players lazy because they want to improve the game. Thanks for the comment at least in the end u contributed to the posts and i thank u for that. As for the other player, no one says u have to comment on every post, if u dont plan on being helpful agree or dont agree at least make a contribution to the conversation not belittle other players or try to turn the conversation into something it is not. Just saying
---
No problem. Glad to help where I can.
---
You don't want beneficial, you want people to tell you what you want to hear because you believe that's an aspect that needs fixing. And some people may have different opinions, you know...
---
 You said yourself that a vending machine with 12 padded jackets is not worth your caps and time. That means you are too lazy to gear up and walk there, or you are too Scroogey to spend 20 caps going from A to B.
---
Or maybe you don't have the time and patience to endure those loading screens and being bugged inside loading camps.
---
 Whatever the case, shopping is easy and convenient. If you want to know if User123838 has a specific item for sale, you can send a PM, by the way. No need to spend your last 37 caps.
---
They bought a few. I had a mutants powerfist and an instigating radium rifle for 1000 then a vampires explosive +10% damage while aiming combat shotgun for 6k. They also bought 800 5.56 ammo but taxes of course pretty well took that away lol
---
Or follow in the footsteps of a lot of game that have solved this problem like Bungie and Gearbox by having a Postmaster/Lost Loot Box where non-picked up legendaries to go automatically. I wished game devs learned from eachother.
---
Sounds good to me.
---
No secrets: 9 rifleman, concentrated fire and tank killer. You can put 2 points in concentrated fire and use that extra point somewhere else, but...
---
Free states means FREE. Tax free goods for sale.
---
See that makes sense to me. I think one day when they raise camp budget i will get back into vending and do what ur doing selling to low level players, cheap, all the things they would need. Thanks for the comment
---
‚ÄúAll the content we ever put out for Fallout 76 all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff, is going to be free. That‚Äôs important. And to say, the Atomic Shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand. Look, there‚Äôs a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we‚Äôre going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you‚Äôre getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I‚Äôm getting that stuff for free. That feels right.‚Äù
---
-Peter Hines
---
I see. I may just drop it at either vault 76 or somewhere a new player night stumble upon them
---
I like to make regular deposits of plans  ammo, and junk, to the whitespring train station. And when im really overloaded on camp scrap like concrete wood and steel ill go seek out low levels an offer to deck out their camps. I like to spread fusion generators and cool plans like all my fancy halloween and fasnact stuff. You cant forget about helping out in a local scuffle. Whats that oh helpless level 34 you have a scortchbeast attacking you? Let me take care of that for ya. Im always the guy at the queen fight cryolating the queen when she lands or flys low. And you know i grab at least 1 pylon during encryptid. I also dont take workshops from people just trying to farm. Ill haggle at my vendor if you dont have enough caps and even hand stuff out if i feel like you need it. And i gues ill have to make a confession if i really wanna feel like a good guy. I buy the XO-1 military paint from modus for 190 caps and sell ot for 5k regularly. There, i said it. Cats out of the bag. Enjoy the sick paint you probably missed everyone!
---
Do u have a good idea of the spawn locations?
---
Oh yeah. I may do that.
---
Im going to take ur advice and assume its clothing very smart thanks for the tip.
---
For sure.
---
I can see why. Im trying to tip toe my way towards bloodied. Im exploring a lot. Im afraid to glass cannon my character for whatever reason.
---
Use it. A fully modded 38 fixer can kill 90 percent of what the game throws at you and can tag everything due ng events.
---
My vats commando, in fact, sometimes takes it to fight the queen. Vats to the head and those scorched are gone.
---
In luck, critical savy, better critical, grim reapers sprint, four leaf clover......
---
With high luck, this is practically endless vats and critical spamming
---
Thank you.
---
I need to get ahold of one. And they need to add .308 mod lol. Itd easily be the BEST sniper due to it being semi auto and pretty good ammo capacity. Its make the gun worth like 3 times though.
---
nope.  The new npc's are people that have migrated to the area, not the magically resurrected former residents of Appalachia.
---
IIRC, because I'm too lazy to look it up, the patch that limited the number of turrets and lights also made it so that one tameable didn't count toward your total. I don't know if there's a difference between a deatchclaw and a chicken, but I recently tamed a chicken and I literally have three small letter's worth of budget left. It didn't make it home, but it was mine for a brief run.
---
I keep low level handmade and fixers in my vending for free. I'll also visit near by low level camps and give them care packages.  I remember how much my first handmade helped me get over that newbie hump.  I recently got 1st and tried offering my private server for people to farm workshops in peace. (Didn't have any takers, everyone was too sceptical I guess.) 
---
I feel stupid talking about how fucking great I am, but oh well it's Reddit. Y'all don't know me! üòÄ
---
[removed]
---
You can always go take a chance and shop there and find something else to do nearby so it's not a total waste. But if you're just in the mood to shop and server hop, it's not always an option. I'm usually pretty picky about where I shop but if it's near an area I haven't been in awhile, it's fun to go piddle around nearby
---
yea your welcome. had a bit of lose change on me, and thought "eh, why not"
---
Thanks. A while back I read something about better crust being bugged and not working? Is this not the case? 
---
I will definitely look at these you suggested in luck.
---
Not sure why u are bothering commenting? Do u bother actually reading the full post or just see something u dont like and boom, post? I dont care if anyone agrees with me all i asked was to start a conversation to see how people felt and what their experience has been. Why are u attacking me and other players for feeling different that u? U must be a troll. Again please move to the next post and let the adults talk.
---
I think glass cannon is the best and more realistic build. To be honest, once you get to level 50, armor will provide enough defense to keep you alive and keep fights interesting. You don't want to be god. Game is more fun when you are afraid of dying or screwing up.
---
Thanks, wanting to see what folks thought as I‚Äôm tinkering with my build.
---
556 always sell fast, as well as good legendaries
---
Absolutely, I should be off next Sunday or Monday night and will pull another all nighter. Just message me if your on and want to join. I work graveyards and usually only play my nights off.
---
While I‚Äôm not trying to downplay what u‚Äôve proposed here and I agree with u in every right of what u r saying.. ur calculations r flawed because the count of scorchbeast killed was almost entirely motivated by the scenario. Both before and after that community stretch goal I‚Äôd avoid and ignore 9/10 scorchbeasts so I think the number is motivated largely by the scenario
---
I might be able to help.  I'm PST so you're 9am would be my 3pm and there's a good chance I  will be available but you're 8pm will be 2am for me so that one is unlikely.
---
I have a heavy gunner that I have used to solo(novice) washout and the one where you pump the water back out.   I haven't c ok completed meltdown, it kinda sucks.
---
Concentrated fire and grim reapers sprint are must haves. Adrenaline isn't vats but if you're popping heads, that damage adds up
---
M3MENT0?
---
Don't bother completing the event, just harvest the Legendaries and get lots of loot.  I usually get 3-4 Legendaries per event, although once in a while it will be none or one.
---
Thats a good idea makes sense. Then u can feel like u didnt waste the caps. Thanks for the comment
---
That is both hilarious and infuriating at the same time.
---
Yeah. And I agree itd be more realistic. Im currenrly level 130. Im trying to get to max caps and get the guns I want or at least a few options. Ive got 17k right now. Im exploring my options for sure.
---
It is not a good thing.
---
Like coke in cocacola lol
---
Yea Im using my mule account, just got a little base set up around that little tower near 76, rest of budget hold my bobble heads ,magazine's  and display cases
---
&gt;A while back I read something about better crust being bugged and not working? Is this not the case?  
---
Better crust works great on pizzas in VATS.
---
Maybe I‚Äôm missing something, but this seems to be saying there are 500,000 different 3* items.  Seems high to me.
---
I'm shocked there's not mods yet that just throw a little beam of light above each corpse so people can see them through foliage easier. The brighter the light, or the hue or it could also make them jump out at a glance.
---
I like your idea, think it could bring some real fun. I‚Äôd consider, when Wastelanders drop, maybe a card game that is only npcs, so the gambling is strictly caps. Not sure how they work the whole cap limit thing, but like you mentioned, make caps fun to accrue, and lose in a big way.
---
Yes. Your main fps boost is from disabling vsynch with ipresentinterval=0 and disabling grass, godrays, depth of field, motion blur, and other stupid effects will really help.
---
You're literally peddling Fallout 1st as "content"?
---
This is a true kindness. Just today I gave away a two shots lever action fully modded to s guy I've never met because he said he wanted to make levers his main.
---
I've been involved with special Olympics and LGBT groups for years and currently have my 80yr old mother and 3 nephews living with me. 
---
It's really a lot better than it sounds.
---
I never blow my own horn like this and it's pretty uncomfortable. Hope your stuff finds worthy people and never forget that if you change your mind the games will be here.
---
Damn spellcheck lol. And I had pizza to try this with!
---
Yeah I hear you, am an old school 8-bit games. It does annoy my brain that I don't get quite as hyper as when I was younger, but hey that's life. As regards giving back, I'm a Support Worker, supporting adults with autism and challenging behaviours and after a tough shift, fortunately I still enjoy gaming. . Due to the amount i wok  I haven't poured as much time into FO76 as would like. Despite owning it since tricenntinial am still struggling for a good leg, and I think  once my caps reached around 4k. Am lvl 97 atm and prefer to solo, so am in no rush really. Anyways that's all,. Have fun in whatever you do in life.
---
When low levels hide behind my turrets to kill something and get my base damaged. I run a nuke silo to launch a nuke at their base to destroy it in return.  When I see a newborn vault dweller struggle to kill something I crouch and wait to see who wins. I don‚Äôt steal their junk but I do laugh at a deathclaw throwing the corpse around before I kill it.  I enjoy this game
---
Ditto. I sometimes look specifically for those camps though cuz i hoard clothes I like lol
---
What planet are you from where game companies can be believed?  Or is this your first game?
---
I feel you. I have three signs reminding me to change perk cards. It seems to be about %15 of my budget.
---
Can you do that every day? Or is it every few weeks when it rotates?
---
Tbh since FO1 i just list all my ammo for free now, cept 5.56, .45 and 40mm - they are 1cp each.
---
Just got back in to the game, hadn't played since March.  
---
Over ThxGvng week, played 5-6 hours a day, maybe one crash a day, except the day I had 3.  
---
Game's running a lot better than it used to.  Imagine if they'd just waited a year, and released THIS version of the game...
---
Yeah it was a special in the atom shop during E3 this year.
---
Oh yeah. I want fo1 but Im waiting for wastelanders to make a decision.
---
Imagine how "creative" the community would be with this
---
Wow, I am very thankful at level 83 I have not seen this (PS4).
---
Sry, couldn't resist.  But I do like your idea of trying to VATS masterfully.  I strted the game wkth a headshot sniping VATS vuild.  
---
Now I'm a PA Heavy Weapons guy.
---
No harm. Gave me a good chuckle!
---
Or when it lands inside the fissure.
---
People were grinding those kills, just like they grind for legendaries. People don‚Äôt pass up 3* legendaries and they didn‚Äôt pass up scorched beasts during that event.
---
If melee get a bloodied/swing speed powerfist with puncturing or a deathclaw gauntlet. They both benefit from unyielding set. Grab a 2* set of unyielding with whatever second perk you like. I generally get Rad resist or poison to keep alive during queen fights. Or get int so you can level faster. 
---
For a weapon personally I prefer stealth commando (shock!! Original!!! =P) so I'd get something suppressed. But a 1* instigating or bloodied lever action is the most economical farming weapon.
---
Hard to buy the 'best' things for caps nowadays. But you can always buy a ton of scrip and start funneling it through slot machine mumbles.
---
How does Borderlands do it?
---
How do they do it?
---
200 different types of items times the number of tier 1 effects times tier 2 effects times tier 3 effects. It adds up.
---
People who‚Äôs endgame is the economy might.
---
If you see my camp I always sell all found 10mm, .38, and .44 for free. As for food. Flatwoods has a ton of plants and some fertilizer. More then enough to start a farm at your camp. And the soups restore thirst and hunger.
---
Is the service changing one the DLC comes out?
---
Idk I just feel like ur looking at two desperate motivators that‚Äôs like comparing good deeds performed at Christmas time to bargain shopping year round. Like they both r motivators but they have no direct relationship
---
Lots of people do have them. Curious where you think my numbers or estimates are off?
---
This is the best method by a mile, up-vote for you

Ok. Would you be interested in a nuclear Keycard?  I was supposed to give it to someone but my Xbox doesn't give me notifications for messages so they blocked me and won't join my team so I can give it to them. I don't want it, because I feel guilty having it.
---
Not that Im aware of. Maybe fixing the bugs, I just wanna see if wastelanders is gonna be as good as its hyped up to be or flop like the rest of the garbage shoved down throats of many customers.
---
Have tamed over 14 creatures budget no longer matters. I've had full build budget this build and had 3 different pets there.
---
I had only tested it half way -- my mistake.  I put stuff in the vendor and it looks like what I named it, but I had a friend look at it, and it keeps the default name for others.  A little confusing, but not as big a problem as I had feared.
---
That‚Äôs why I included the error. But it‚Äôs harder to find a level 50 3*  than a scorched beast so if you are grinding both it‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôd be able to find more 3* than scorched beasts.
---
I've been playing since the start and been helping people since then, I remember the day of 400lbs stash and nowhere to sell ammo so everytime I would be maxed of gear I would drop it off at vault 76 when I seen someone was coming out these days it's the same see a low level give them stuff to make there's and my day.
---
Thanks for the update good to know
---
Yes it‚Äôs hard carrying this big brain around.
---
Are you a full health build? My primaries are Furious/+10% while aiming furious handmade and a Vampire Explosive handmade. I have a Furious +10% aim gatling plasma I swap some perks into for doing the queen.
---
Having the gatling plasma for the queen really spiced things up for me, it does a lot if damage. I drop sturdyframe and blocker for heavygunner perks and gunsmith for stabilized when I use it.
---
Furious Handmade is 10-20k
---
VE handmade gets up toward 20-35
---
The gatling plasma I found in a shop for 5k, not sure its value. 
---
If the handmades have FFR or 25 less vats their prices are probably higher.  
---
Hope that helps
---
Sweet! First off thanks for doing this. I‚Äôll have to look up what legacies are but I‚Äôm interested in the caps. I‚Äôm on PS4. Just past level 50 this week. Working on getting all the trophies so I‚Äôm on the level 100 grind. I spend most of my caps on 5mm rounds at other players camps. Got a sweet Mutant Gatling Gun.  It goes through ammo. Good luck to all.
---
They've got me earning too many badges already lol (scouts).   
---
But seriously, a sash or something to wear that would display badges earned from the major quests would be cool
---
I went from rifleman to commando to bloodied... I still keep my auto railways and ghoul slayer hand made on me.  Sometimes it's just easier to pop some radaway and be able to take damage abd be able to stay alive.  
---
I never had any interest in bloodied, but it's fun. Ha.  I carry a bloodied.... Axe, handmade, railway and, lever action.
---
If build had a name... Bloody hybrid mess, but a fun mess it is.
---
At night, I put my Fasnacht Toothy mask and worn American patriot suit and go to random CAMPS while playing creepy music box songs (I literally search it like that on YT) over the mic. I don't get reactions every time, but when I do they are priceless. 
---
From ending up chasing someone with a flaming chainsaw while we are both screaming like madmen, to having people put on their own Fasnacht masks and follow me around scaring others around the Wasteland.
---
This game has a lot of issues, sure, but it can be so much fun.
---
In the same way some people would spend the majority of their Tim grinding the beasts but would kill legendaries they found along the way.
---
I take all their water and junk if they have a scrap bot.
---
Not going to type a story, just wanted to say this is a nice, genuine thing you are doing. 
---
Tip of the hat ol chap.
---
I dabbled in bloodied a bit, but I could only imagine with an Unyeilding set giving +3 str per each piece and a good bloodied melee.  But if the Meta is too expensive for me just now, maybe I shouldn't stress so much and just keep playing my way.  Its got me this far.  And who knows, a lucky drop or a cheap vendor could make all the difference.
---
Bring back survival in any form. That was the best part of the game. Run into people and wondering if they were friend or foe.
---
Litterly tye the reason I own the game.
---
I always run up and take the item even if I die because of it
---
This is what I hope our current neon/bulb/small letter sets evolve into. It's just so time consuming to display a message
---
a perk that did that would be p good
---
Yes. A postmaster at train stations would be great.
---
Can't find that legendary corpse that flew across the map from an explosion? Server hop and go to the postmaster.
---
Go play in your pay to win private server then.
---
I randomly drop Commander Chubs in front of the Vault 76 entrance
---
I buy any drifters outfits under 100 caps and give them to low level players because if you have to grind 50-100 levels to get a good build you might as well look good doing it!
---
I'm guessing you have 30 civil war outfits at your camp.
---
I honestly stopped playing months ago, but my wife continues to play daily. Without fail no matter what bs update or bugs come along she keeps playing and having fun. 
---
I would love to win anything special or hard to get to pass on to her. We both started about 5-6 months back so anything legacy I am sure we don‚Äôt have.
---
I‚Äôd take it even as a power armor mod or a wearable item that highlights legendaries like goggles or something.
---
Hey look, **a piece of shit.**
---
Tesla
---
Yea I‚Äôd like that. Just go to it at the end of the session and grab all the weapons/armor.
---
Hey look, a paid shill.
---
If you see empties in the first round, just abandon that event.
---
Especially in tall grass or a cave or when it‚Äôs in water or at night. And the worst is in the mire.
---
Use mines at the spawn points.
---
Or it‚Äôs a legendary robot that blows up and goes into damn orbit
---
This would be cool
---
Oh man I forgot about that. That‚Äôs the worst
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
I bet this post will be the post that changes their mind about you.
---
Well my story would be about giving away legendaries to player's of all kinds, and having a food giveaway/chem giveaway to people in my server after nuke's or events, I'm hoping to possibly get a legacy so I can put it up in my shop for display, maybe use it before I do.
---
Aside from it, I have to redesign and move my base, i'll set food and chems up in obe of my vendors for everyone to partake in.
---
New players should know the kind of bog they are stepping into.
---
I haaaate that so much, either you run to it quickly before it blows or wait. That sentry bot from the Halloween event killed me like that, so I gave up and just waited till it blew up lol hasn't happened with the imposter sheep squash yet lol
---
*sniff*
---
It smell like unjust ban hammer in here
---
In before this is removed.
---
Having said this, I partially agree.
---
That's what this sub is about. Create a cukt mentalilty and praise Todd and ban anyone who says otherwise.
---
My Forest scout pieces also look like Urban scout pieces in the inventory.
---
Must be a bug introduced in a recent patch.
---
Im glad they fixing it, it's a good idea but i don't have one on my new character atm.  Just for me I actually refrain from using it currently right now because for some folks the vaporized body doesn't even appear for them. :C
---
Nope, but the White Springs has a soda fountain that sells all the flavors of Nuka Cola in small quantities that resets every cell reload.
---
No.
---
It costs less than an equivalent Atoms purchase and gives me other benefits. 
---
Is it scummy? Yes.
---
Will I still sub? Yes, unless they make it shitty. As is, it's a pretty good value.
---
I just started my bloody quest... Ha.  I have 1 peice of unyielding, a level 35 bloodied handmade.  I also run adrenal mutation, which litteraly gives all your weapons the bloodied effect.  I had no idea, I even posted on here asking why all my weapons damage is increasing the lower my health.  I laugh at myself.
---
They better not rehash what we already have. That's a low blow and an easy way out for them.
---
I expect something new and exciting that ties in to the current story.
---
I have a bloodied 2‚òÜ railway in my vendor right now if you are interested in trying it out. 2nd star is +33% vats hit chance. On XB1 btw.
---
So far as I know it's purely a tiered check based on the RNG when scrapping.  I.e. there's set percentages for common, uncommon, rare, and ultra-rare that are checked when the scrapping occurs, and then results are provided to your character if positive.
---
I actually forgot to post that, yes most of the time folks are generous and helpful with the emotes and waiting for everyone to get a tag on the legendaries. The loot from the normal MM are definitively important. I agreed with you
---
What system are you on?
---
Deal breaker
---
The thing is, each individual game has to turn a profit on their own in order to justify continuing development of new content for it. They're not going to say "Well, we're willing to run Fallout 76 at a loss just because these other games have done well for us." 76 needs to keep being profitable in order to justify new content being developed. That's just business.
---
It's hard for friends to even discuss this issue without it urging heated. I've heard of some falling out
---
how can I check my connection speed on a ps4, No wifi btw and my issues are almost exactly the same as his, I love fallout I stopped playing since march came back last month started fresh most of the same bugs are still here, I am out of gears now from all the times I lost all my turrets and bases because of getting disconnected
---
Nice, so how do I know what week will be that week?
---
I am not paying $100 more just to have it not crash as I already paid 60 for the game and 60 a year to play it
---
I don't understand why people want these in the first place they don't seem very good
---
I usually see him wandering near Wilson's autos. Seems he's there quite often.
---
You can use the camera and just look around, if there is a legendary corpse, it'll say so.
---
I don't think it matters. I remember making the lowest level handmades when I was trying to get the last mod for them.
---
When I see new players around my camp I always give them a bag of goodies, which include stims, water,  and some plans. When it comes to events like Uranium fever I will use my worst weapon so other can get a hit on the legendaries.
---
I like to 1shot kill the mole miners at uranium fever so noone else gets drops. I like to run and kill all of the adds at a queen fight so i alone get the experience amd drops. I also like to go to workshops and kill the owners for fun while teabagging theit corpse relentlessly.  I will also steal yout loot bag. And i love to drop all of my trash right in front of your vending machines. Pick me lol.
---
The Black Site
---
I'm new myself.
---
If you get a bounty on you by accident run back to camp and dump your junk in your stash before someone kills you and takes it.  
---
The only way to get rid of it is to die,  don't worry to much about it.
---
Also if you find yourself with high level enemies and another high level player is killing them,  take a  shot at each one.  If you shoot something even once you get xp when it dies no matter who finishes it off
---
There is a recipe for Nuka Dark in game, but that is the only one I'm aware of.
---
I'm an amateur pvper. One night I tracked a wanted player level 100 something around flatwoods. He was hassling some level 20s by their shack of a camp. I got him a few times and he left. Afterwards I asked to join the lowbies group and I put up some rare event stuff, flags etc. I didnt think much of it until slowly more started to emerge from the woods with their pipe pistols and random armors lol. I ran out of materials quick putting stuff up around their camps and making them decent gear.
---
I've reached the point of having the gear and armor I want (except legacies lol) so most of the time I find people who need it and hook them up. I stay pretty healthy on caps. Anyway that was probably my best true story. Thanks for reading.
---
seems like the easy solution would be to simply have a perma quest - kill 1 star legendary - kill 2 star legendary - kill 3 star legendary - that just gives us script we can use at a vendor to get the weapon category we want and skip the searching all together
---
It's just because they are rare drops, no real value besides what people decide on.
---
You can change it back at the armor bench.
---
There will be 2 paint options that say "no paint" just try the first one &amp; see, if not try the second
---
Just do what I do, I check the market and if I see someone who really wants an item I have I‚Äôll give it to them. Today I met someone who really wanted a nice axe so I just dropped him one I had. If I‚Äôm close to max caps I‚Äôll find a low level trying to get by and go to his camp and buy all the junk they put out for sale hoping to make a buck.
---

So you're not contesting the "pos" part then? Just making sure we're all on the same page.
---
That sounds too convenient, it should be a perk effect
---
All they need is a description, if you're selling legendaries u can say what ur selling and the prices... very simple
---
Why contest anything a paid shill says? They are paid to abuse people. It's not their fault they work for a soulless corporation.
---
It doesn't take any budget anymore. I've had 2 deathclaws, a cat, a dog, a rad toad, at my current camp at max budget.
---
i m level 550 and i am still missing Radium mods
---
i actively built&amp;scrapped a few hundred for a while but after spending 8000 screws i gave up
---
They already have the code available to do it right, because they did it in Skyrim.  Little markers on the compass that show where your kill is located.
---
Uranium Fever is not a good source of legendaries; there, I've said it. Farm scorchbeasts instead, and just go out adventuring. Lately I've been getting swarmed with legendary enemies without even trying, I think they must have upped the spawn chances dramatically or maybe having 30 Luck helps.
---
Hey I‚Äôve been trying to do the raids as well my psn is Clubrocker7.
---
people get paid to point out which people are pieces of shit? take my application
---
The way I've been looking at this is that duping is not the problem but the depressingly low odds of getting a desired item is the problem. Duping then is the "solution" to that problem, but of course duping brings along problems of its own.
---
There are then two questions: why are people after such specific items when they are so rare to drop to begin with, and what effect does the rarity on these "godrolls" have on the game?
---
\- As the OP mentioned, even at high level you aren't guaranteed 3 star items from a 3 star enemy. And there are few avenues to guarantee 3 star enemies, and a substantial number of them, either. This game is very stingy with meaningful loot. In Diablo 3's Greater Rifts, you are guaranteed at least 10 legendary items in a run at higher levels, these items all have the same number of effects on them, and the Rift runs only take 5-10 minutes each.
---
\- Unlike Diablo, the effects on Fallout 76 legendaries drop with a static value. Every Junkie's weapon does 10% extra damage per addiction up to 5 addictions: there aren't any 5%/addiction, or 7.5%/addiction up to 3 addictions. This means the game \_has to be\_ stingy with loot because if you ever do get a godroll you will never need to replace that weapon, whereas in Diablo you're chance of getting a godroll are inconceivably slim that you settle for an above average roll for the desired item until a better version drops. A year in we are already seeing people bored of the loot grind since there is nothing to strive for once you get that godroll, from duping or otherwise.
---
\- Related to the above, a game like WoW does have set stats on epic items, but the level of the item can vary and effect the magnitude of the stat. A normal raid will drop a staff with 100 Intelligence, but the heroic version of that same raid will drop that same staff with 115 Intelligence. This is another approach FO76 could take: level 50 legendaries from events, level 60 from hard difficulty public events (e.g. Encryptid, Paradise, and Scorchbeast Queen), level 70 from Vault 94, and so on. All of these items would always drop 3 stars, and the 1-2 star items would be limited to &lt; 50 level items. This would then allow for a steady power progression as the more you play the game the more powerful your character becomes. Of course, WoW's approach is that these items cannot be traded, but as the Vault 94 armors are not meant to be traded it seems this is the direction FO76 will be going.
---
\- To beat a dead horse, Diablo and WoW also have class-specific loot, limiting the types of items that can drop for you so you are more likely to get a desired, albeit non-optimized, version of the item you're after. If you are a big gun power armor build in FO76, you have to sift through so many 2 star combat armors and 1 star unarmed weapons before you ever see a big gun you want.
---
\- Many legendary effects are strictly inferior to the most popular ones. Reflecting melee damage or increased bashing damage will never deal as much DPS as faster fire rate or stagger as much as explosive. 1 CHA is the same as having 1 less star on your armor piece. Balancing needs to be done on an ongoing basis to keep things competitive, ensuring that item values stay within a certain \~5% threshold between the top and bottom ends. New effects could be added in minor patches: we shouldn't have to wait for a massive story-oriented DLC to see them.
---
\- Because only 3 stars with good rolls, and select 2 stars with good rolls, are sought after, people throw out average or below rolls as the benefits of the Purveyor and the limited stash space outweigh the community benefits of selling these items to players. Since this starter gear does not exist, people new to a build are after the same items a seasoned player of a build is after. This nurtures very high demand for what we've confirmed is minimal supply.
---
\- The cap limit, as well as the lack of meaningful cap sinks, drives the value of caps down and godrolls skyrocket high. Combined with the low chance at a godroll drop, people don't accept caps for trades and require a specific legendary item in return. This means desired items that happen to drop for a different player are hoarded, collecting dust, further boxing you out of that item.
---
There are many more reasons, but the combination of these factors is why the early power grind is so frustrating, the higher power grind is riddled with roadblocks, PvE and PvP balance is broken, duping is so rampant, and the player economy is a mess.
---
you can do it as many times as you want
---
you just get completion rewards once a day
---
but there is nothing stopping you from farming acid there 24/7
---
This happened to me too, and the quest was stuck for about 2 months for me. Everyday I would turn the tissue in hopes that it would un-glitch itself. But it never did until one day, my teammate had the quest. After he killed his cryptid, I went up to the cryptid, and it had the selection to 'collect' the sample, but it seemed like it didn't let me collect the sample.  So I just shrugged it off as the quest still being glitched. Then I went to turn in the sample as I did everyday, and it suddenly completed! 
---
So... maybe find a teammate who has the quest and try to "collect" a new sample to stick in the analyzer even if it said it didn't collect it. Apparently the sample reset the glitched one in my inventory to allow the quest to complete.

That is fantastic.

I had a friend in high school who was involved in a serious accident where he almost lost his leg. As we were still in high school, all of other friends and acquaintances continued on with their lives (social events/parties etc). 
---
At this time, I did not have a deep arsenal of emotional vocabulary, but I knew I would‚Äôve felt defeated about the accident and completely isolated (I now know this is called empathy). So I started visiting him after school, staying over on weekends when others were out partying, and began picking him up everyday for school (once he was able to go back to school). There were a lot of things and great people that contributed to his recovery, but I take pride in the fact that I did my part at such a stupid and crazy developmental period. 
---
Side note: He and I became incredibly close during that period and have been best friends for the last 10 years. A nice gesture turned into a lifelong friendship. 
---
Thanks for your generous attitude and giveaway. Happy Holidays!

Make bulk junk items using your tinkerers bench
---
This fixed it for me, Thanks!
---
So any weapons and armor in there take out and scrap or sell.  It's a waste of space.  You will find or craft what you need when you need it.
---
You probably have tons of steel and cloth scrap.
---
Build a tinkerer bench and bulk it and sell.  You don't need it all and it's easy to get.  
---
Also make sure your junk is all scrapped.
---
The known plans are useless.  You can try to sell them in your vendor at camp but they wont sell quick or for much so toss if I need space.
---
Then check ammo.  You may have a lot of fusion cores for power suits.  They are 3 pounds each.  If it's full I keep if low I toss.
---
Also missiles are 2 pounds each and add up.
---
Basically you get rid of what you don't need.
---
That's all a good indicator unless, like me, you put yourself in debt to get the game and couldn't afford to buy atoms until many months later. 
---
I agree with OP, beta accounts should have recieved something on the anniversary to show that we stuck around.
---
PlayStation 4.
---
I think I like this one better. https://youtu.be/BvVlGHf-M3E I would have made a better video if I had known they were going to move and build something else.
---
Well, you get about 3 per 500 scrapped, so, yeah, 1500 is about right... probably closer to 1800.
---
.
---
Learning to build ain't easy at ALL.
---
thanks!
---
But the world revolves around your opinion.

How to have two interior walls face the other direction?
---
Have 2 floors connected and choose the middle as the wall section. After that place one wall down, add the interior wallpaper now or later. Then add the other wall and rotate that one to face the other direction in the same plot, then voila! Add wallpapers on both or one or none for whatever reason to have two interiors facing away from each other looking like one wall.
---
‚Ä¶ you're camping on my spot. 
---
*shakes fist*
---
scrap all your junk down before you stash it,
---
bulk aluminium and lead at you tinkerers workbench,
---
aid quickly sums up so dont litter your stashboy with chems and aid you never need, dont gather to much (youll never need hundreds of most scrap except for ammocrafting or such)
---
dont stash non legendary weapons for your late game scrap every weapon you cant use
---
you just cant get away with gathering everything you need to choose what you desperately want to keep
---
except for the most valuable junk (ballistic fiber/copper/crystal/fiberoptics/black titanium/gold) you can basically sell or throw out everything and leave like 20-30 scrap of each other item
---
youll never need hundreds of wood or aspestos
---
and a little sidenote, check your your ammo section (explosive ammo like mininukes/missiles/grenade ammo) they can go you wont need them and they are very heavy
---
I don't know why but I like calling this Mr Fuzzy "Black Tom Cat-ssidy" for some reason. And I don't know why aside from wanting to make a shitty pun
---
When I was younger I made an account for wizard 101, after a few years they did an event and gave players different statues + mounts based on how long they had been with the game. Something simple like that would be cool
---
If it's still in its original coffee cup and teddy bear form you need to break down that junk into its component parts. Any crafting bench will break down junk but only at a Tinkerers Bench can you bulk that junk (needs plastic tho). Bulking junk both saves space and makes it so you can sell it to vendors.
---
Once your junk is broken down and bulked the next thing you need to is decide how much you want to keep. How much you keep off what is up to you but generally I keep 5 of each kind of bulk thing except for 10 each of steel, plastic and lead (sometimes wood if I'm redecorating my camp) and 50 of all the other non bulkable junk. Again it's up to you how much you keep off what but that's my rule of thumb and the remainder gets sold off dumped in a suitcase at the nearest train station.
---
You'd be surprised how many player's leave their scrap bot unlocked.
---
Been playing with the perk build site,  but still not sure if what I'm picking will be wise.
---
Seems like I should at least make sure luck has 15 points??
---
Or how about put in survival before the retarded damage nerf got put in. Survival was immensely fun until they introduced that bullshit
---
OMG thank you! My queen of the hunt has been glitched for months! This is the greatest ray of hope I've seen!
---
I contest workshops and kill other players
---
Sweet thank you! So you know how much charisma I need and do you know if it's based on the base state or gear factors in?
---
Could you drop a link to the perk build site, if possible. That would be a good tool to play around with.
---
I think they have spread out the legendary creatures rather than upped them. I barely do events and can get enough scrip for 2 to 3 characters a day by just roaming the wasteland. Some of my best drops have been from legendary mole rats,rad rats and bloodbugs.
---
My solution is to only fast travel to camps in response to LFG posts (I guess discord would be the closest PC equivalent). If it's on the way and I'm travelling on foot, I'll stop by. Otherwise I don't east my caps on what may or may not be disappointing loot. Maybe I miss out on some deals, but if I do I am none the wiser. I never have the situation you described breaking the flow of me enjoying the game.
---
This is going to turn in to "who has the least amount of downvotes"
---
I‚Äôm not sure how other platforms work, but with xbox I am able to go into xbox account, and turn off auto renewal, can also be done from the Microsoft acct as well. That way you don‚Äôt have to be concerned once the year rolls. But if you can cel and what a refund, then get all the scrap you, and outfit stuff prior to.
---
I dunno about you guys but one of my favorite things to do here is helping out low-levels out. One time I was just relaxing in my camp (which is stationed near the Whitesprings) and I see the icon for the "Help" emote out in the distance near the entrance nearby  the train station. So like any do-gooder I drop everything I was doing and rush to help out whomever was issuing that panic button. 
---
Turns out, there were 2 low-levels (one 15, the other 18) who decided to take a trip to the resort and were ambushed by Level 45+ Super Mutants. So like any valiant knight in shining armor (or in this case some dude in a trench coat), I aided them in defeating these deadly high-level foes. The dust settled, and Mutant corpses littered the road. We exchanged hearts and thumbs-up emotes, and they even sent me an invite to their team. I decided to tag along with them cause I knew they will not be able to survive the dangers of the resort by themselves. 
---
I don't want to make the story too long so I don't overshadow anyone else here but after multiple ghoul kills, an encounter with a Deathclaw, a shopping spree, and a subsequent escape from the resort when one of the guys accidentally shot a robot and another guy was about to nuke the place, I bid farewell to the low-levels, exchanged goodbyes (and some spare supplies for the road for them), and parted ways, venturing off inro the wasteland once again by my lonesome.
---
Great memory
---
It‚Äôs frustrating they wouldn‚Äôt implement something like this if they already have it in other games. Especially since it‚Äôs a good QOL update that would roundly be enjoyed.
---
i dont know man a sack of wet toast is probably quit heavy could probably at least take out a small child with it
---
What the buck are you implying?
---
The game just has shitty optimization. It does that on every platform.
---
I have a lvl 1 prototype suit so it must scale.
---
how did they clip the big neon joe sign through the walls like that? been tryna do that for my dj concert but i couldnt figure out a way to do it
---
alot
---
Is he scorched? If so thats why
---
It gets worse. If you claim a workshop and later someone comes to challenge it. If you don‚Äôt fight them for it they will travel to where you are and rage at you for wasting their caps.

If it is, make it a reasonable amount that people who don‚Äôt buy atoms, only earn them, can get it. Maybe 4-500, I‚Äôd like the idea though that it costs like 20k caps. It would be a more welcome item that even the more casual players would try to accomplish, cause them to play more and grind for caps. I truly think though that it‚Äôll be part of that election thing coming later, more times you win, the better places you can stay in.
---
? well you learn the mods with a plan so when you make your new one you will still know the mod
---
With survival mode gone, workshops are really the only outlet for PvP at this point. Maybe that‚Äôll change in the future, but for now, unless you want to fight other players, just avoid workshops.
---
Just Vault 94, all the others are yet to be released.
---
Set it up with all true stuff and burst fire it from the hip. Only way to make the thing work right now.
---
There really isn't any reason NOT to make a mule.  If you have a friend that can babysit a bag you can dump off all the stuff you know is worth something or you might use to save stash space.  You can do it yourself if you have a private server.  You can't move caps by yourself, but if you have someone to help you can 5x your stash if you want.  It's a pain in the ass but it's built into the game from day 1.
---
Xbox One X has the best performance of the ones you listed. Supposedly the Lions share of their internal playteating is on the X and that is the reason it's so poorly optimized for more powerful PCs. 
---
It very well could be that PSN/Xbox Live are more stable than the purpose built alternative for PC but that is 100% speculation. I say One X over PS Pro (aside from you not listing it) is the One X is slightly more powerful and Xbox live slightly more reliable.
---
I know the mask shows up as a marker on your compass but I don‚Äôt bother too much with the event itself, I just go for legendary farming but haven‚Äôt had any legendaries my past few runs!
---
Being able to help my parents with money issues is pretty nice to be able to do.
---
Yes. I have incinerated several legendary shitbats mid flight the last few days and been unable to find the ash piles lol
---
33 LUCK is the breakpoint to fill your crit meter in one shot with the Crit Savvy card.
---
Look for legendary armor pieces that all have the unyielding prefix and exactly 3 of them most have +1 LUCK. That will add to 15 (base) +15 (unyielding) +3 (three minor +1 effects).
---
That shouldn't be too hard to find as a base, and actually leaves room for godly effects such as sentinel or AP regen but it's really hard to find godly pieces like that.
---
As for automatics, this will make 2/3 shots crit. 1 shot to fill meter, 2 shots as crits. Effectively a 66% crit rate.
---
They were for the cut quest "Room Service" - [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Room\_Service](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Room_Service)
---
so first of all i love that post
---
some people on this subreddit may remember earlier this year i sold "sets" wich basically were starter kits for various playstyles
---
nothing groundbreaking but basically whole sets of armor grouped together with nice low level legendaries and occasionally some apparel or aid
---
the whole point of this was to help casual players to start roleplaying a bit
---
players seemed to enjoy what i came up with and i was very proud with my work but i just didnt have the time and creativity to go on with it
---
since then however i gather a lot of legendaries and my plan is to go on with it when wastelanders releases
---
i want to sell one set per week and basically make a little quest/competition for those who want it
---
they will be all/mostly legendary things like exterminator sets or something among those lines
---
if id recieve one of the legacies id love to include it in one of these sets once the time arrives
---
anyways as i said i love your post and idea and i hope you may value gaming enough to at least get a few hours in every once in a while, would be a shame to loose such a person in this community üëçüèº
---
If you turn off auto renewal you'll keep fo1st and won't be charged again
---
If you ask for a refund you'll get your money back and lose fo1st
---
Plans for camp stuff can be earned thru workshop defence missions. Not sure if the walls are tho.
---
You can make 1400 caps a day Max by selling to robot vendors. Save every gun from enemies you kill and turn them in.
---
Also cooked food and purified water and drugs was a good start.
---
Pretty sure there's a heavy sharp rocket mod for it that is the best mod for the sledge
---
That doesn‚Äôt exist. Vampires + explosive + 10%dmg while aiming
---
The explosive effect and the 10%dmg while aiming both occupy the 2nd star slot the ‚Äúmajor‚Äù effect
---
That looks FANTASTIC!!!!
---
Pretty sure they changed it so you can now buy items to complete challenges.
---
Seems like part of the adventure to me.
---
Exact same thing happened to me ...... Only about half an hour later did I remember that I was carrying PA with jet pack. Went back and retrieved my  Bashing Ghoul slayers lead pipe...... LOL
---
It's a two edged perk, when it work ( well fed ) you get a bit more tanky resist very well diseases ect, until it kills you after a fight when you are at 25 ish hp and get suddently hungry, it's a nice perk but i quickly gave up on it
---
Lol who needs to pay anyone to shit on 76? Anyone would do it for free. Heck, I paid Bethesda $60 for this crap game.
---
So what im getting from this is that you're a sad person who has no idea what being a decent person means
---
me it's in wastelanders because I'm tired of that
---
I know this will never happen, but if we could know the level of the camp owner, that would save a ton of wasted time. 
---
I realize that it could be a mule or alt, but let‚Äôs face it, the majority of the time when a &lt;50 level player has a bunch of weapons and armor listed, it‚Äôs all non-legendary crap.
---
Well you nailed fair play I thought it was something I missed that would have been an awesome way to end that quest
---
Agree
---
Cant get explosive and 10% damage while aiming on the same weapon as they both are secondary effects
---
Yes, I don't doubt that for a second!
---
Thank you for this quote, was looking for this.
---
How is a scrapbox and tent not content, how is a private server (that mods probably will be tied to) not a feature? All cosmetic items I guess.
---
I am too! I make all my money from junk and ammo and magazines/bobbleheads. I'm unarmed so sell all the ammo I find with Scrounger, and I also make 5.56. At first I used to bulk the junk for my vendor but then someone on here said, 'why do you do that, it's a waste of plastic, you can just price your junk per unit to get the same amount'. They were not wrong! So now I do that, which means I also get to make money from the plastic, which sells like hotcakes!
---
or being so full of shit.
---
Well that answers the quesion I had, did you manage to learn any "Unlearnable" plans via scraping.
---
&gt; (Building a PC to run games is too expensive for me, so it's not an option for me. Could easily drop $4K on a gaming rig)
---
It is only expensive if you make it expensive. Comparatively, PCs can cost much less overall than consoles over their lifetime. Don't forget you have to pay for monthly online access just to play many games.
---
&gt;I‚Äôve found dense plans in watoga, Welch, Lewisberg and harpers ferry,
---
Are you referring to world spawns or Vendors?
---
If you pay for the year up front and cancel, you will get the year. You will never "waste" money, as in you will always get exactly what you paid for or get refunded. Keeping your money and giving you nothing is called stealing.
---
  If you're below a certain level (level 7 or 8; not entirely sure) then no public events will pop up for you at all, not even Fertile Soil or Scorched Earth. 
---
  No idea when they changed it, I personally dislike the change but yeah, that's a thing now.
---
Wanna trade places?
---
If you can, add in Scorchbeast Brain - +3Int
---
Holy shit 900 hours? In fo76? Man you might need help i'm serious
---
Thanks.
---
strange change, but well‚Ä¶
---
So I will just keep going and see when they pop up.
---
You just need animal friend and be at least twice the critters level. So charisma 3. Have seen no difference with just 3 vs the 6 I run with vs boosting it even higher with chems and gear. With some the larger games like sloths and death claws u mush almost get up right next to them and ADS for it to show the tame option.
---
add me on psn: Owl_No 
---
what is your lvl?
---
65
---
Thank you, sent you an add right now, I‚Äôll be free to play tomorrow though
---
\&gt;&gt;  I get it, I'm on a popular campsite between a lead and junk resource 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Clearly you don't. Otherwise you wouldn't be here complaining about it and would just accept it as part of picking an overly popular location. Just like those Whitespring train station CAMP's
---
quad tesla does the job, doesn't have to be a good one. cheap and nasty one star. I regularly come out of uranium with over 1000 carry weight when the mobs actually spawn
---
Honestly fella, I just do as I do. I‚Äôm no saint and I‚Äôm no demon either. I‚Äôve killed more players than I care to count and I‚Äôve given away more legendaries to low levels than I could ever sell. Will I use those legacy weapons for good? Probably not. But they probably won‚Äôt be used for bad either. Who knows. I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm just a guy doing whatever.
---
We HAVE to take hints from other MMOs
---
depends on your build. I run bloodied, first one to lock onto the other guy wins haha. bffr railway is no joke if you're using Vats. bffr handmade, bffr fixer, bffr tesla
---
who actually plays the game in the hope of getting an exact roll from a drop? this is what the trading system was brought in for. trade your drops because one man's trash is another man's treasure. trade up to your desired gun
---
To add to this, Mini Nukes, 6lb's each. Bin those as well.
---
Never bother with workshops on public servers, only use them on private.
---
The vendor at the white springs train station should have them
---
Or fall into it. Was literally over a legendary body about to loot it, then it fell through the floor.
---
&gt; Both are dollars, both have a different tax percentage that's it. Just looking you can tell the game is being charged less in the states than in Canada. 
---
You think 1 USD == 1 CAD?
---
&gt; Just looking you can tell the game is being charged less in the states than in Canada.
---
If you're naive enough to think that 1 CAD == 1 USD.
---
&gt; This was not about the exchange rate. 
---
Uh, yes it is.
---
&gt;  It's about how the same game will be sold for less in America than in Canada both in starting price and sales tax. 
---
In this case, and I'm only talking about this case, very, very slightly less in starting price.
---
And the sales tax is decided by you, via your government.  You cannot blame the seller for the sales tax.
---
Not a bad idea OP, unfortunately toxicity has reached your thread once again. After scrolling through the replies and truly a contest of "who has the least amount of downvotes".
---
I wish you a pleasant journey out side of the Fallout world and here's a one last Nuka Cola for you!
---
Tom
---
This is obvious I guess.. But did you try to move your camp and replace it.. Sometimes that helps
---
Obvious yes but I'm not gonna move it cause they havent fixed the game I finally like where it's at and I'm not moving it for that reason and besides who's to say that if I move it I wont be able to place anything at all I'm not about to take that risk
---
The games priority is getting you into a server at all, camp placement has no bearing on the server you end up in, should definitely be an option though
---
No, it‚Äôs the only thing in the game you actually have to worry about. They don‚Äôt need to be like teddy bears too
---
Man, I have no problem with these. I can take many hits and soak it up. 
---
Maybe you‚Äôre playing the wrong gear / health type / weapon. 
---
I can put them down in 3-5 shots.
---
Of course they don't. They can make them hurt like the super mutions. At least that's a challenge.
---
What armour do you wear?
---
Agreed.  These are one of the few things that can actually threaten a well-geared character, they do not need to be nerfed.  And if you target the thrusters, they go down quickly enough.  Use VATS and be smart about how you fight.
---
Really? Where?
---
I'm not understanding this, VATS doesn't aim for the weak spots, it just locks on to the target.
---
The number of unique legendary 3\* items is closer to 350.000 than 500.000, not that this makes that much of a difference.
---
The 3\* mob kill numbers are very likely to be severely underestimated, though. Even during the scorchbeast challenge, there were vast numbers of players who didn't significantly contribute, largely because either they didn't have the equipment (low-levels) or inclination (crappy loot, annoying to fight, whatever). 3\* legendary mobs, though? I'm fairly confident those are being hunted down more or less consistently wherever and whenever they turn up. But even if you were to increase the numbers by a factor of 100 or so, this doesn't significantly change the problem of good 3\* drops being severely undersupplied.
---
So, I still agree with the gist of it: the current loot system is crap, duping is likely to be rampant, and the need to go to outside channels in order to trade high-end stuff due to Bethesda having no idea about how to design a game economy is a huge barrier for trading and hence bad for the game.
---
You need concentrated fire in perception to target different limbs, without it you only target the torso I think
---
The only thing is I barely have any points to perception /: so this wouldn't really be helpful for me
---
If you can spare the special points (or had luck with the card packs every 5th level) invest in the card hard bargain early, so you can sell for better prices. If you have some grape mentats, use them before you buy/sell expensive stuff.
---
If you used up the daily limit of 1400 caps from the vendors - buy something you want and a part of the caps spent will go back to the vendors wallet (up to 1400 again if you buy something expensive) so you can sell more stuff. 
---
(Almost) free plans: claim workshops, defend workshops. Store your junk before you do this, in case some 'nice' level 999 shows up to stomp you
---
Visit player camps and look for camp plans, usually a lot cheaper than robot vendors
---
Things to collect and sell on the go with low weight: Clothes, chems
---
Things to farm and sell: cooked food (plant crops at your camp or visit one of the farms at the W side of the map), purified water. If you have the card green thumb, equip it before you harvest crops
---
Yea, 1 rank in Concentrated Fire allows you to selectively target head/limbs.  3 ranks makes you a sniper-god with head-shots.
---
super mutant parts from mt. emmett?
---
I'll try putting that perk maxed then. Thanks!
---
Exact same issues tempted to quit again but I promised I would get to level 100 and finish the quests my experience today made me want to quit more than ever, died while defending a power plant I fixed then server disconnected, fixed the powerplant again some how lost all my gears and oil so I couldn't fix my stuff walked all the way across the map to get What I needed only to have a few level 300s steal the base they did not even build any thing and they were first members spent 2 hours and only got 2 cores...
---
I've never had three servers in a row I've had to go through before I found one that I could load my camp into. I'm saying it should look at your camp location and find a server that has that spot available
---
What Dixie said above
---
Yea, I guess perception helps a lot. I only have 2 points in it unfortunately, so I'll have to level up more just to swap some points to it
---
I have the same problem, but at almost every event not just uranium.  Someone said they are going to fix this. Can you tell me how that might work please?
---
You are complaining about troubles killing enemies with ranged weapons while have no points in perception ?
---
This could be an AWESOME weapon, but... BGS decided to gimp it with NO SUPPRESSOR and crap sights.  Give me a handmade with decent sights and a supressor and you have a worthy back-up to a handmade, heck maybe evern better in situations.
---
The key to killing them is cover and high fire rate or large damage output weapons.
---
What is your platoform?  I can make the building parts you need and a TON of extra stuff if you are on PC.  All I need is for you to tell me what you want, I make it you place it and then rinse repeat.
---
Broke my own single-year record and raised $1,500 for kiddos at Children's Hospital
---
Who said I was using ranged weapons? Also not everybody in the game uses perception. I had charisma because I wanted to share 5 star cards, strength &amp; intel is for my weight. So I have a reason to not have many in perception. But I have a mutions where my charisma is negative so I'll put taking two points off of that and endurance as well.
---
And yet you still hang in there... those bugs are there to stay.
---
To me üòÅ
---
Thanks! Glad to see a lot of helpful tips. I don't really try to go after them and when I do I had trouble. I'll try using these things üòä
---
Wow. This must be super bad now.  I've had bad events like you guys are describing and got concerned, but the next event went normally and I figured they fixed the bug.   I don't do the event super often, but I'll try and see what happens.  P\*ssed me off when it happened the first time.
---
I'm here to up vote everyone to balance out all the down votes!
---
Into the ether.  They're gone and never coming back.
---
Bethesda‚Äôs pocket to take them out of the market
---
They are gone forever
---
I assumed cause consentrated fire .
---
Well you aint gonna kill things by sharing cards.
---
If using ranged weapons max perception is pretty much a must have for dmg cards if you actually wanna kill stuff.
---
Just tired of ppl with QoL cards not understanding why they cant kill anything.
---
Sounds like you want "freespeech".
---
I have news for you, "freespeech" is just to protect you from prosecution. That does not mean you have automagically the privilege to post anywhere you want. If the mods decide they don't like the way you write/spell/smell they have the right to rescind your posting-privs here.
---
Crying about it does not endear you to anyone.
---
I'm melee and when I'm not hiding, I have to deal with their armor penetration. One Gusty is okay. But when there're too much of them, use cover. For the weak spot it's his thruster. But if you run a crippling build, destroy its arms and it will launch a kamikaze attack.
---
I can kill most stuff. It's just the Mr. Gustys I had trouble with because it's the only enemy in the game that kills me in about 4-5 hits. I shared 5 Star cards because I really like to help out my teammates, I'm a helpful person in this game. I didn't think I would have to explain everything but I do I suppose.
---
Honestly, I've never encountered a legendary anything at Emmett. Wonder if they decided to make a WestTek 2.  The deathclaw was a garbage boss and the the mine was underpopulated.
---
As if they're capable, lol. This has been happening since Skyrim. A decade.
---
You call it a bug, I call it a feature x) I hate when I spend too much time in the same server, these little bugs help me remember that I need to move to take a new mutation, find some new legendary, etc.
---
Just move it once, then move it back to the same location.  It's like 50 caps.  Rebuilding the base for some reason always seems to fix the bloat issue.
---
That's what people didn't really even question if I was a melee build or not. If there's a lot it's hard when they all shooting you üôÑ
---
Thank you for your testing and comments.
---
I also did some experimenting...
---
One of the comments was that possibly the damage was not displaying properly.
---
Experiment logic was to use a low-damage weapon so that 5% damage bonus would be noticeable even if not displayed.
---
I took a basic 10mm pistol, removed damage enhancing perks except Tenderizer, and went "hunting"... Victims for testing became Mole miners.
---
- the damage showing was 11 per shot (with or without Tenderizer)
---
- it took 36 shots to kill a Mole miner (3 clips)
---
- Tenderizer did not make a difference
---
I will have to do a follow-up experiment.  If Tenderizer lvl.1 provides 5% damage bonus and the game rounds down, then 5% on damage of 11 may not have an effect.  I will repeat the experiment with a weapon doing 20+ damage per shot
---
Now it's on Bethesda's hand. But it's unlikely to happen unfortunately. I'm waiting until Wastlanders to decide what to do with my ps4 account since I loved to pc. But I'd love that to happen.
---
It's useless.  I only bought it to troll the whiners.
---
The collectron, however, is both fun and useful.
---
How long is the Ranger Advanced Armor skin available to 1st members? All month?
---
I tried making a camp on the right side of the map a few time sbut I'm a terrible fighter and, despite being level 195-ish, I have substandard gear and AWFUL aim, so when a group of three or four level 68 Supermutants, or a trio of level 50 Murlocks show up, I'm risking death to engage them and they tear my base up in the process.
---
So, despite selling high level gear (mostly good stuff that I, myself, am not built to use) I'm over in the low-level area, because I suck at combat real, real bad.
---
(I mean, for the record, a build with Int 15, Cha 12, no mutations at all, and which avoids doing stealth, power armor, or Bloody triggers can be *made*, but... this is not  a good idea. Trust me.)
---
Nah, see they terrify me. That's good design. They make me feel like a dirty commie
---
Did this a couple days ago and had 200+ acid in 10-15 minutes before I got bored. Great method when you find the event.
---
If you're melee, put a point or two in agi for Enforcer. Try to find a legendary shotgun with weight reduction and use it to cripple things. Usually on melee I can one or two a shot it, depending if I'm hiding or not (stealth melee build). But yeah, if I'm not mistaken it's the only ennemy that use armor pen. I run a full set of UNY but my DR is around 400 in both. They're not a big threat if I dispose on them quickly when I'm detected. I rarely use stimpack with this character.
---
I can 2nd this. A similar problem happened to me a few updates back and moving my camp and demolishing everything definitely made space to build what I currently have.
---
Xbox.

Somehow converted to $$ and directly deposited into 1 of Todd's offshore accounts...

---
Not sure exactly but there is a level that you don‚Äôt lost your junk if you die I would stop at the level before that
---
I hate it, but as far as it is, it‚Äôs basically a form of in game advertising. I personally, only put legendaries or rare items, I just don‚Äôt make money on medical or crafting supplies. It would be nice though, to break it down by legendary status.
---
They enter the abyss

Those caps pay for the free items in the Atom shop. :-P

Uranium Fever is pretty much a scrip/cap farm while hoping, PRAYING you'll get Shielded Raider plans. That and looking for scrip to bank for another sale.

Sentinel Looch already posted his Discord below - message him for an invite, and look forward to seeing you soon!
---
You'll  100% miss them if they ever figure out how to fix it(hopfully never as doing so would probably cause 2 worse bugs)
---
I do venture into those areas to buy and have found some good buys. I also have a camp in the forest by arktos for the acid and it has no defenses, i might come back to a scorched or mitant but maybe only level 5 so no worries..thanks for the comment
---
Try other workshops... this one and Poseidon's are the ones people really dispute I think.
---
I believe the excess goes in the secret stash...the purveyors nether regions, past the legendary drills. Gooooooood luck with alllllll that!

Radium rifles want a word

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
I know, it's not that bad, but it's distracting as hell and breaks the atmosphere. I hope they fix it soon.
---
It depends of what the mule is going to store and how much effort you want to put into it.
---
You cannot equip the Excavator PA until lvl25 and some of the weight reduction perks (bandolier, ordinance express, batteries included...) have a higher level requirement than the 'usual suspects' (travelling pharmacy, pack rat, thru-hiker...).
---
It also depends on whether you can get hold of low level armor with weight reduction.
---
I managed to get a set of lvl20 unyielding armor with 5xWWR which is pure gold (doesn't make weapons weightless but it does reduce the weight of any weapon regardless of type and/or mods by 90% and with 35 STR on that char is just a bottomless pit :D)
---
If you take your time and take them to 50 - taking advantage of double exp weekends and with a bit of practice/planning you can do several of them in one weekend - then the possibilities expand a lot.
---
Lvl 45-50 armor with less desirable primary prefixes + various weight reduction prefixes is cheap and widely available in people's vending machines.
---
The key here is planning. What do you want to store in the mule, how much effort you want to put into it and can you be arsed about QoL stuff or not.
---
As opposed to other aspects of the game that are pure RNG therefore do not reward thoughtful planning, investment and effort this is one aspect that the more you put into the goal the more versatile and rewarding it is.
---
it stays in the box and you can still take it out but just can't add anything to it anymore
---
I just threw on my hazmat suit and ran around to collect fluxs when i was low level and that event happened.
---
&gt;SBQ is scripted to gain Health and Resistances based on the number of players present at the event.

no she isnt, stop spreading false info

 https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbuz2r/psa_scorchbeast_queens_health_does_not_scale_with/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Not really true.  There's a cut-off point for usefulness.  This is why back when there were more organized clans running multiple Queen Runs, they were very careful to have a certain ratio of support players, because even though it's useful to have someone handle adds and apply stimpacks, each person present increases the Queen's health and damage reduction, and so there has to be enough high-level firepower (no, your gauss rifle alone won't cut it) to carry through the Queen's boosted defenses.
---
Well this is a nice gesture.
---
I just play as a good guy. Help people where I can, making sure not to one shot legendaries, giving people what they need or sell them at a very cheap price. I like to hang out with noobs sometimes to help and teach them.   
---
I don't really have a specific story, they're normal and generic. Like seeing a lvl 20's workshop being taken over and helping them out to defeat the attackers. Or showing someone how to make healing salves. Or selling stuff in my vendor for 0 caps. I'm sorry I don't have a special story to tell.
---
‚ÄúMy hubby, bloodfart‚Äù. Lmao
---
click the link i edited in, she _does not scale__
---
thats about bang on. WHY are you getting downed for this reply ?????
---
Downvote all you want.  It won't change the truth.  Math is hard to argue with, just do a seach in the archived posts of this sub.  It's been spelled out before.  Bringing along dead weight will insure a failed event and wasted nukes.
---
I have no idea where it originated from but it's been his GT for a long time üòÇ
---
her health scales with each person in the event. so if lower levels who are underprepared make it harder for those who can withstand the battle. since bigger enemies will smack them around like a rag doll. in most cases lower levels do not have much in the way of good enough gear to be effective without acting as more than a target for NPC enemies.
---
&gt;her health scales with each person in the even

this is false, click the datamine i linked

Cheers!

when i replied you did not have a link on my end

I've played since launch, only once was I killed for a workshop, At times I had 5 or more at once. But be aware, PVP is full on at workshops, even if you are on pacifist mode. oh turn pacifist mode on in settings so you don't accidentally shoot other people. My experience is that the community is very kind and will rather help than kill you.
---
Turn on pacifist in settings, then you can't shoot people by accident and a bounty.
---
Ok. We got a lot of new screen shots and teasers about wastelanders last week. If we get something every week there won‚Äôt be anything new to unveil at launch.
---
My gods, I've been begging for a quest/dialogue/inventory log since the Beta.  I've been in your shoes, so many times!
---
If this happens their brahman must die
---
Oh c'mon maybe 1 guy did this to you.
---
No idea üòÇ
---
It's not a big deal, but did you see the point or are you just excusing Bethesda?
---
THANK YOU!!!!! 
---
I hated even more this time bc it was one of the more interesting quests in the game, totally kills the Questin‚Äô mood.
---
üëç
---
Its kinda lvld to your character. Somethings like enclave quests you don't see until you do part of the quest line. 
---
Airport you need to trigger now. Fertile soil has a much smaller range. Those early ones had some changes.
---
I still have my legacy TSE Gatling Laser, which has been removed from the loot tables a long time ago.
---
That's probably the closest thing we have :)
---
Can assume your luck is high via unyielding? I've learned most the DR mods by scrapping way less but I scrap early and often. 
---
Lately I've been farming armor plan locations for the rare ones.
---
FYI safes are worth while and you have a chance to get a weapon plan as well. Never loot a safe that you may go back to unless it has a plan you want.
---
Whether you are level 5 or 600, workshops are pvp areas. If you are unwilling to handle that there are other ways to get scrap. Need titanium? Go thin the herd of mole miners in the ash heap if you arent willing to take on raiders of workshops.
---
I wouldn't feel so bad about my own house IRL if I applied the phrase, "order is not natural" to it. hahaha Seriously though, some good advice.
---
Only have this happen once a week or so, usually claim the hemlock holes workshop for the acid.
---
PC here, consoles seem to have a higher population of douchenozzles.
---
Aye, quite agree, it was a dumbass move on my part to claim it. And a momentary lapse of common sense to post my frustration. I‚Äôll be a good little wastelander in future and take my licks quietly.
---
At least you can loot those. Mine just disappear never to be seen again right as they fall to their death
---
I wonder if the bot accepts cooked roach meat?
---
Yep, agree totally. No more workshops for me, but thanks for the advice, greatly appreciated
---
The caps are equally distributed among all the cap stashes and super mutants.  You see, instead of just giving money to the impoverished vault 76 dwellers, the powers that be decided it would be better if each vault dweller had to pull themselves up by the bootstraps and go looking/killing for caps.  This in turn stimulates the economy as the vault dwellers need to purchase ammo and aid in order to proceed (and of course there's no free healthcare in Appalachia)
---
I wonder if peeps are just tired of the ‚Äúpissing into the wind‚Äù rage against 1st ?   It‚Äôs done.   
---
I for one find it fascinating that in this game, just like real life, some peeps are splitting into factions.   That Aristocracy group of 1st-rs for example, and the ones that hunt them.   Reminds me of the types of behaviors in the FO76 lore.  Too bad peeps don‚Äôt learn from the mistakes of previous generations.  Reminds me of the old saying ‚Äúthose who forget the mistakes of the past are doomed to repeat them?‚Äù
---
Is it just human nature?
---
ü§îü§îü§î

Peace
---
You were given the Perfect Storm, a 10mm smg with explosive modifier. Probably some other ammo and basic stuff as well.
---
The thing is you have to know where you are... Would you lose time keeping you camp all pretty pretty in the middle of the Apocalipse?
---
You woulda hated playing a year ago when you or your camp was never safe. I miss those days.
---
They are sent to the "Feed-a-ghoul" foundation, which actively works to shove buckets of rad-away down the throats of non-feral ghouls (in the form of meals such as "Spicy Blamo Mac and Cheese" or "Sugar Bomb Marshmellow Treats".).  There are some ghouls who resist, thinking that rad-away causes autism, so some of the money also goes towards education and/or hunting down of these ghouls.
---
There is a bug in game show you are on stealthboy but.
---
Yep.  Don't take workshops on public servers. PvP players have completely destroyed the experience.  Use private.
---
No, that's just speculation with no basis.  They could have kept Survival just fine.  Survival went away because players few players in the game care for it, and those that do just do it toxically.
---
If you want that, go play Rust.
---
It's frequent.  Griefers are definitely on the rise.
---
Let them put in a link from 7 months ago that was copied and pasted from the other 12 months ago after the first queens ever done. Knowing Bethesda said how many times they changed the values completely?? Anyway I'm not a programmer so someone please point to where it says "number of players = same resistance" or something to that effect? All I saw was "multiplier" something...
---
And sorry if I didn't specify the real problem but I'm surely not the only one that's noticed anything from only a few extra enemies to having 20 beating the crap out of me from start to finish...
---
Capital building is good xp.
---
It's pay for minor convenience for all the utility items.  Not Pay to Win. Name one that would actually be Pay to Win
---
Yeah, it's unfortunate that this behavior empowers them psychologically.  A little sad frankly.  Perhaps we should arrange counseling.
---
Really? I don‚Äôt think exclusive outfits were promised besides riot gear
---
No, he‚Äôs not. The other person who responded answered it, I believe.
---
I believe it‚Äôs a burning effect, rather than explosive.
---
Mine's level 3!
---
He can carry the same max amount as any other character, he'll just be overloaded quickly - and the stash is 800 lbs just like all the others.
---
I just place him at a train station near a stash box and some world containers to make life easier to transfer stuff to him and all is good - I don't to run around with him he's just 2300 lbs of spare storage :)
---
didn't think the enemies level scaled with the player there because it's apart of the forest
---
When you go up to the door it warns you that it's lvl 30+. But they are all max lvl when I go and I am lvl 140.
---
Idk, I am just suggestion something new. They did promise exclusive items in the advertisements.
---
ight sik cheers man ill probably start using that place then as its closer to my camp
---
Usually has 1 3* in there also.
---
Climate change, you know?
---
wait so i can get more nocturnal laser pistols
---
You dont it just, it just does what it wants
---
To Bethesda. I mean Oblivion. And, technically, Bethesda in that case too.
---
Its role-play like this that really helps bring the game to life!
---
Agree, I don't even like the outfit, having more reskins of an outfit I don't like does me no good.  I'd much rather see some more interesting outfits
---
Should be for everyone that can and will contribute, not freeloaders that do nothing but make it harder sorry
---
They did say there would be discounts, my guess is they are giving the new skins for free as said discount.
---
Utility is the term i belive your looking for
---
Somebody in the last Uranium Fever I did get so embarassed by the thumbs down from everyone else that left the event.
---
That Could Go Very Wrong, Very Very Quick
---
I thought I was the only one who got those smoke glitches
---
They should also fix that bug where loot bags sometimes dont have a marker on them and the bag blends into the ground.
---
Legacy explosive energy does energy explosion damage...  the only counter is to get really high energy resist and stack on damage reductions.  Still probably a waste of time - my advise - skip PvP entirely.  Fireproof does nothing neither does dense vs legacy energy explosive.
---
A five day old account that only has shitposts in its history completely showed me the error of my ways.
---
Or other stuff besides outfits, like armour paint or camp items. As someone who likes mixing up armour sets outfits aren't my thing, especially when every other person in the game is wearing the same thing.
---
It's great seeing stuff like this. I don't know how some people do it, I've seen camps that are at least twice the size of mine and far more intricately decorated yet I'm always struggling against the build budget. I must be missing a trick.
---
In  a way we get armor piercing ammo via magazine mods or perk cards.
---
Yeah I would love some CAMP items or armor paint too.  Outfits are neat but I also have started not wearing them as much because if I spent the time to get a full set of marine armor gosh darn it I want everyone to see I have a full set of marine armor
---
That is frustrating... How about we incorporate the user's level into the vendor display. Level 300? Legendary Central. Level 30? Probably not.
---
Seriously, use the fucking search function. This question is asked every goddamn day.
---
I tried for 20 minutes or so to get on the roof with my jet pack, but kept encountering hard-stop invisible walls.
---
LMG would like to have a word.
---
Seen all the vendors sooo many times - sorry, I have no recollection of which on had it.
---
I got up on the left side, maybe luck as the wing was right on the edge .... but not lucky with the legendary weapon I got for my troubles
---
it's not quite the same!You get some bonuses for a brief moment,but using different kinds of ammo,with the Wastelanders and coming,dealing with raiders and such,would be a very nice addition
---
I've almost flown to the moon during queen fights .... lol
---
I love when people say come murder me!
---
I want some spicy mac n cheese for real though. Even marshmellow treats. We got smores which are good. But yeah i want these two now. Mac n cheese- 1 mac n cheese box 2 spice 2 brahmin milk 2 boiled water?
---
Yep, agreed.
---
The legendaries disappear and the whitespring's robots are empty
---
Managed to get on for a while last night - you were busy in a nuke zone so I didn't bug you, but I'm sure you saw all the purchases popping up on your screen.  
---
Thanks!
---
I work in retail and if I had to listen to this on my time off I'd throw my controller through my TV.
---
Yes to this! I really don't want to buy all the serums plans every time for my characters
---
Thank you
---
Do you kill the sbq fast though and do alot of damage
---
That took that out. The discounts.
---
If you are having problems killing the SBQ then maybe you need to rethink your guns and perk layout. Don't blame low levels because you're not correctly setup for the fight.
---
Sheogoreth has visited this plane of oblivion. You find the mad hatter table northeast of Tyler Fairgrounds. Nice easter egg. Not as cool as the Wabbajack! Eh didnt see that one coming did ya?
---
I want a player karma system, where you can give players +1/-1 thumbs, and that becomes a karma thing.  Then put players of similar karma on similar servers :)
---
Wow, this is a great camp
---
The said exclusive emotes and the ranger outfit. Look again.
---
Reminds me of the Youtube video from Kevduit, where he wantet to try killing the SBQ with a bunch of low-levels.
---
His end commentary:
---
Did we contribute to the fight? Not at all.
---
Did we make it harder for everyone else? Absolutely.
---
But hey, worth it because we got these cool legendaries ‚Äì that we can‚Äôt use until another 30 to 40 levels‚Ä¶
---
When that incident happened I doubt there was a damage cap to 120 or something. Anyway, he had a quick shooting weapon with explosive ammo and was a matter of 2-3 seconds anyway.
---
Yeah, thanks for your advice, but I'll stay away from workshops. Plenty of places to get junk and whatnot.
---
Hi Stelli,
---
dann schau doch mal bei Vault76.d
---
Also pay attention to junk that cannot be bulked, but can be sold in raw form. These will not show up on the tinker's bench, but have a non-zero value in the stash box. For example, I once had more than 700x raw asbestos before I noticed and sold the large majority of it.
---
I have the t-60 with the Elder Paint Job xD
---
Or When you kill a scorbeast in the air with l√°ser weapon for example and you Can find the loot
---
this. Plus like to mention that the best way is to open the engineering wing first, enter the room with the generators and not progressing the mission (no repairing or inserting keys or whatever). The crickets will keep respawning. If it seems like they stop respawning, usually there is one hiding in the corner. Once you have enough acid, just leave the vault (= most economical way).
---
Ahh got ya. I had one that was a scorched but also diseased not sure if it was casued by one or the other but he kept doing that earthquake thing. Replaced him with a regular one and it never happened again
---
It does not matter as far as I know, so just just craft whatever version is the cheapest. Also, in the case of armor, I craft and scrap the lightest type (of combat, leather, etc.) when possible.
---
How does this technically work?
---
Could you just put on a hazmat-suit, fire one shot with a pipe-pistol at the SBQ, and then hide till it goes down, and collect the XP and loot afterwards?
---
Just asking for a friend‚Ä¶
---
Well although I don't think that was the point, it probably has become the case. And we do know that many of the servers used for Survival became private worlds, so in a way it does seem likely.   
---
I see a good way of trying to balance it out a bit would be to add some other PvP options in the base game which people can go into willingly (maybe a Raiders vs Settlers game mode/event once Wastelanders drops?)
---
Level isn't everything, and weapon "worth" is kinda relative.  What's bad to you may be the best thing another player has.
---
  At 156, best weapons my Excavator clad self brings to the SBQ is an AA LMG or a ballistic Gatling....no more than 50 dmg per hit ... against a DR of what, 32k.?
---
its the lease fee on your vending machine....
---
Honestly feel like commenting about what I‚Äôve done may end up like humble bragging but idk hopefully not. I just play the game, helping others out who are lower level, giving extra nuclear key arms to those that wanted to do a double sbq stuff like that. I just stay away from meta builds bc that would make the game easy and stale. I just help others, like crafting a full set of t60 armor to give to a level 40 that didn‚Äôt have good gear, or running a silo with a below lvl 50 so they can complete the last quest. Stuff like that.
---
I have a great home for you. Its a lake house in the Savage Divide. Lovely area, with an acid node. Don't mind the neighbor. He is a scorchbeast that gets upset with all the new tenants. Now this house can be all yours for a simple 10,000 cap down payment.
---
Greetings,
---
Also started yesterday, but on PS4. So no crossplay‚Ä¶
---
But if you open the map you can see other players and their level. Low-level players will probably in the starting zone of the map, so‚Ä¶
---
Enjoy the game.
---
See. That‚Äôs the thing. My deathclaw changes, from server to server. I‚Äôve never seen him as a scorched. Mostly he‚Äôs just a plain old deathclaw, but sometimes he‚Äôs diseased.
---
I had the same thing happen, walked into a workshop and got one shotted. Must be some sort of hack or bug, I didn‚Äôt claim it or any other workshop, and had pacifist on. 
---
And these people are trolls, not into PVP - if they were they would be in nuclear winter. But they want a one-sided unfair ‚Äúfight‚Äù, so they do shit like this.
---
I don't remember if June was before or after they changed how public events are started.
---
They no longer trigger just by a player walking into the appropriate area.  
---
Public Events are now on timers.
---
I think the Morgantown airport one is the exception, as it is started by dropping a flare in the mortar.
---
Yes we should like say some flies flying above the meat pile ? Oh wAit we do !
---
Did you store the items, or scrap them?
---
Scrapping frees budget, storing does not.
---
i killed  3* scorchbeast with a plasma gun bc it was the only weapon with ammo left and the fker turn into green shit and disappeared... i keep around like halg and hour until it was dark trying to find him but no luck lol
---
Ok thanks for the advice the 200 or so other times I did it must've just been luckyüëçüèº
---
I like it the way it is.
---
I'm (lvl 85) protector of my older brother (lvl 35) and nephew (lvl 46).  My brother for some reason is a SB magnet wherever he goes, last week he was poking around Pumpkin House and after the dust cleared the score was my gatling plasma - 5 to SB - 0 (2 were legendary).  He's even spawned a few over my camp and that's the only time I've ever seen them there.  He now refuses to go sightseeing too far without me as he plays solely for fun and doesn't get into the game systems, etc.  
---
He also had a random lvl 11 and his four lvl 100+ buddies lockpick and completely decimate his camp a few weeks ago.  (How does a lvl 11 have +3 lockpick?).    This would've been enough to put him off the game so I rebuilt him in a less trafficked area and unloaded my supply of 20 mini nukes on the instigators camp.  It appears that guy has since been banned.
---
Not sure what legacy is vs. legendary but they sound cool.  Happy Holidays!
---
except mules are the opposite
---
It was hardly rage. I was pissed off, I cried like a baby and now I‚Äôm over it. But thanks for stopping by, it‚Äôs been a pleasure
---
Thats cool thanks for the comment
---
It would ideally still need to be improved in at least one way, right now an automatic handmade still has slightly better DPS if we take the non-linear damage resistance into account, and the handmade also has much better damage/AP ratio in VATS. The SMG could have better ammo capacity though if it was not for the "buggy" stinging magazine on the handmade. All in all, the SMG is decent enough as a secondary weapon against weaker enemies, and to save 5.56 or .45 ammo. It could benefit from somewhat better fire rate, though, or reduced AP cost.
---
I didn‚Äôt know excavator gave you extra ore...
---
Lol, well said, you sold me on it.
---
It is a cap sink. Every game has them. Artificially removes caps from the "economy" (as if this game had a decent one lol).
---
Even with that i am almost always near max caps.
---
Not a waste of caps but time.  I'm end gamer in the 200's, grab 1400 caps per day, sell stuff all the time and spending caps to travel around he map is no big deal.  BUT, yeah, going to camp showing 30 armor and 27 weapons only to find clothing and nothing legendary kind of sucks for wasting time.  Maybe just put in brackets next to each the number that are lego.  Armor(3), Weapons(5)
---
Very true... Level 2 camped on top of Whitesprings Station? Definitely worth a trip.
---
For that reason, I take workshops only to get plans.  
---
Check the map for other players.  If none are around, hit the claim button, and immediately head for the green line marking the edge of the zone.
---
As soon as the claim bar completes, step over the line and get out of the zone.  You'll still get the reward.
---
For defend events, if I'm still in the area, stay outside of the zone and snipe the CG enemies.
---
If you increase by a factor of 100 then you are saying people kill 10 times more legendaries per day than they killed scorched during the kill scorched challenge.
---
If you feel like keeping up with the ammo and its not your main gun then yeah go for it.
---
Lvl 2 then i got boored
---
Ducks are 'in' bro.
---
Honestly just enjoy the ride. 
---
Don't get worked up about what your missing or not doing or should be doing. Focus on beating the main questline, exploring the map and levelling up.
---
Doing all that will put you in a good place for when and if you want to join the endgame grind.
---
No idea mate, not particularly light on the armour. It‚Äôs all good though, learned a valuable lesson, no short cuts on resources from now on, time to take out some miners. Thanks for taking the time to write though
---
Cheers mate, I‚Äôll look into it. You win today‚Äôs ‚Äúmost civil response‚Äù award
---
Fallout 1st üëå
---
If you mostly want it for queen fights I would look for a Scorched one.
---
True
---
I shall find it! Thanks! üëç
---
not that I'm aware of.  I crafted 10 of so lowest level possible lever actions, then immediately scrapped them.   Learned 6-7 new mods.   Int is either 9 or 11, I forget which.
---
Took me a while to get round to 76, didn‚Äôt fancy the hassle you speak of. Fortunately most of my experiences have been positive, I was just having a moan, but thanks for your input mate
---
Btw "over a year" was implying that I, uh, played over a year and maybe have an idea what I'm doing üòÇ. Actually since fo3 doing quests and building up to the end. What you're defending is the equivalent of 80s and 90s cheat codes that warped to endgame
---
Bulk doesn't save space, it just makes it sellable to the vendors.
---
Such a good idea!
---
No, you won't be able to add more, but you don't lose any of it. You use out of the scrapbox until it's gone.
---
This has been asked hundreds of times on here. Maybe search for answered posts asking the **exact same question**, next time?
---
This was what I was looking for.
---
Sure it would be cool, but I wouldn't hold your breath.
---
Yeah lucky that the other players carried you through the event. Don't blame low levels because your not as good as you think you are.
---
Ive combed through the subreddit and hadnt found the answer myself. But thabk you for answering.
---
It's going to fund reconstructive surgery for self-conscious ghoulified humans. Just accept it, and be happy for them.
---
&gt;  And we do know that many of the servers used for Survival became private worlds,
---
No, we don't know that, for the obvious reason that there are no physical servers.
---
Bethesda doesn't have a room of servers hidden somewhere.  They use virtual servers on AWS.  They can dynamically create and destroy servers at the flick of a switch.
---
Why is this a problem? You had a free pet for a while.
---
It's the same as ESO's crafting bag.
---
While your subscription is active you can add/take things from the scrapbox as you please. When the subscription ends you can no longer add anything to it, but still take/and use the scrap inside for crafting.
---
Anti disease wouldnt help. Soon as you exit, instant rad worms, or parasites.
---
How is that worse.  You get to mock them for being idiots.
---
Yes , you loose your weapons , armor &amp; caps also
---
Ah makes sense. Thank you for your help.
---
Simple text chat would be also a ,,MUST HAVE''.
---
I understand the math, but... RNG nullifies your calculations, my original (Main) character looted Four 3\* TSE Dragons, and three 2\* TSE Handmades by level 80, that same character has continued getting epic drops regularly up to level 350. I'm now playing on a second character that is currently level 201, and has never gotten what I would consider an epic drop. During my session last night, we killed 3 SBQs, and I killed/Looted a total of 19, 3\* enemies, and did not receive a single 3\* loot item, RNG just sucks sometimes.
---
No, you need to do a certain percentage of damage to "Tag" the SBQ.
---
You can earn the achievement for defeating the SBQ without firing a shot though.
---
I play on an X with a wired connection, and an S on a wireless connection. Aside from some FPS issues during combat on the S, they both perform well enough to play competitively.
---
I would recommend the X, but it's also $100-$200 more than the S.
---
Id imagine they could use Vault 94 instancing technology so you load into your  room and can invite folks so long as you ate the party leader.
---
Get explo laser for yourself and shoot first... There is really no counter against them atm.
---
i know it's kind of a long shot...but i suggested the repair kits in the past and they implemented them!So,why not those?
---
We're still sporadically living through them, without the NDA
---
Supermutants Retirement Fund.
---
PA edition owners got a fancy non-canvas bag
---
Helps pay for the secretive Nuka Cola Delivery Service.  Those vending machines can‚Äôt fill themselves! Bringing refreshment to the wastelands since the bombs dropped.
---
I‚Äôll pay ten times that. Looking for a profit? LOL (nice find)
---
In whitesprings's the maintenance area, in the bathroom there is a gas mask in the toilet.  I figured it was a good place to keep one.
---
Workshops.
---
Pro tip: get yourself some Troubleshooter Heavy BoS armor and some good weapons. Its how i usually clear silos by myself.
---
Don't complain about afkers getting the loot. Either we all can get the loot or only those tag it. Unless you know of some way to implement a system to prevent afkers from getting the loot while not stressing servers.
---
Where do I get heavy bos armor? Sorry I‚Äôm learning a lot
---
Purified water... thats it
---
I still miss the bug where you can turn the Sledgehammer into a stick by using the No Material option. Was fun whacking things with a bloody swing speed reduced weight wooden stick. Why did Bethesda remove that option idk. But go for Armor Penetration rocket powered.
---
For the love god please, what an amazing Christmas present this would be.
---
I play the game alone and actually enjoy it.
---
All of these problem can be resolved If they allow mod support
---
If you go to Grafton, the Vendor there sells the BoS plan and i believe you can get the Heavy Combat plans from Free States. Also to get Troubleshooters its rng there. Best try recycling tge Purveyor or fighting legendaries.
---
I don't think that realistically happens or you've just been extremely unlucky with griefers.
---
Thank you, I‚Äôll try figure things out when I get home :)
---
If i still had my xbox i would give you my set but i uninstalled the game and sold the xbox to pay bills. Hoping for a new xbox for xmas if im lucky.
---
Thanks, makes sense.
---
So I will rather stay away for a while. Don't really care much about achievements...
---
True is hip fire
---
Stabilized is ads
---
Aligned is vats
---
IDK about magazines, but for other items that say "Acquire xxxx" buying that item from a vendor (bot or player) does count toward completing the challenge.
---
Actually what I'm saying is that your obviously not very good at killing the SBQ. If you have to blame low levels for you not being able to complete the event that is your fault. Just because you played for over a year doesn't mean you know what your doing. That is obviously clear because you have to blame low levels and post it on reddit.
---
&gt;Every 3\* legendary item has a 1/500,000 chance of dropping 
---
Not sure where this number comes from but I assume you're multiplying the number of available armors/weapons by the number of available primary, secondary, tertiary affixes. It's more than likely wrong just at a glance because considering all factors it's doubtful that calculation would work out to 500,000 so conveniently (even rounded). Not every affix can apply to every item. There is also not an even chance of spawning weapons vs. armor which would be two completely different numbers. Your odds with the purveyor are also completely different since you can choose the item type and number of stars. I know people that cashed in over 11000 scrip during the last 50% off event. I also don't think the odds for these things are even well understood since it happens server side. Any legendary that drops can also be said to impact the odds of generating god tier weapons because they are required to generate the necessary scrip.  
---
&gt;Every 3\* monster has about a 1/3 chance of dropping a 3\* item
---
The purveyor has a 100% chance of dropping a 3\* item :p  
---
&gt;When there was a challenge to kill scorched beasts 44,000 were killed per day. Scorched beasts are at least 2x more common than 3\* monsters so it can be estimated that 22,000 3\* monsters are killed per day. That means that 8.5 million 3\* have been killed over the 390ish days the game has been around. 
---
None of this makes sense. Whitespring farming is still a thing. So is farming Westtek. People run these for the express purpose of spawning and killing legendaries. When we talk about legendary spawn chance it's important to consider that mob density (the number of mobs) and time between encounters is a huge factor.  Several events guarantee 3\* spawns additionally. Scorchbeasts are also not "2x more common" they are 100% chance spawns in at least 5 or 6 places in the cranberry bog alone, along with several other places around the game world. It doesn't make any sense to use scorchbeasts as a measure for how many 3\* legendary enemies are spawning in the world.  
---
&gt;Even if you account for 100% margin of error due to purveyor trades or other estimates that means that across all three platforms at most 11 of any particular item has dropped. 3 or 4 per platform 
---
If the margin of error is "100%" then this means your calculations need to go in the garbage :-p
---
All said I don't necessarily disagree that there are a lot of duped items floating around (including all the legacy ones) but I am literally paid to do stats and analytics for a living and I question much of the math and information presented here.
---
Experience of taking things (junk) for granted, without repercussions..?
---
Workshops are PvP zones, have been, will be. You get a warning when claiming. What did  you expect?
---
I have the whitesprings jumpsuit that I've been holding onto since Mischief Night;  how much is that thing worth anyway?
---
Agreed. An AA lmg is nothing to shake a stick at and gatlings i think are the most base damage per shot of all the heavy guns
---
World of difference from a lvl 15 hiding inside a bunker with a pipe rifle ...
---
Awesome! I'll give that a try tonight, I'll report back if it works for me.
---
They need to fix the display of rewards and the actual rewards. I completed the enclave event the other day, and modus decided to send me a package from space that contained one hit of calmex, a can of dog food, 24 dollars and a wooden left leg.
---
we trim our tree on christmas eve...
---
Yes. Look at it from other side, though: plenty of high lvl players around, saturated with junk and doing queen over and over
---
Sorry dude/dudette, I think your experience has been different from mine.
---
Ha! Noo
---
This happens to me all the time, but sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. Think it depends on the server. It happens in PA and unyielding gear. Freaking sucks. When this happens I just join another server
---
All decorations or just your tree?
---
The Vault 94 raids add most of what you're asking for.
---
So far it seems like they do. Halloween and thanksgiving stuff came out right before and stayed there well after the holidays were over. It‚Äôs annoying and seems very last minute and thoughtless, like a bunch of 20yr olds were like ‚Äúoh shit bro, mom reminded me it‚Äôs Christmas tomorrow‚Äù.
---
I have two female characters and the riot gear is absolutely useless to me. Give us the skins AND something new, Bethesda
---
Your experience is that if you take a workshop everytime someone takes it whether your there or not, and if you don't come they follow you around the map getting wanted picking locks and trying to fight you? I simply don't believe this.
---
No what they  should do is if you kill a legendary  it disappears they should just put legendary item in your  inventory
---
You're over it because you didn't find the warming embrace of other weaklings like you thought you would.
---
I‚Äôm always down for a silo run. My team launches 3 then hop servers a few times.
---
I almost think they donitnsonwe cant grind atoms and are forced to buy them instead
---
Yeah I only take them for the ‚Äòclaim a workshop‚Äô daily at this point and literally as SOON as I finish claiming them I fast travel away to avoid getting killed. Almost every time without fail I check my map and see another player lurking nearby the workshop right after I leave. Sometimes they wait there for like 20 minutes trying to see if I come back.
---
Someone taking your workshop, sure. But not following you around the map if you don't defend it, and definitely people aren't sitting in hiding staring at the screen at an unclaimed workshop for hours waiting for someone to come by.
---
I hate it when you loot a corpse that has both a tresure map and a legendary on it. You loot the legendary before the map and the displaying of the tresure map cancels out the displaying of the legendary.
---
They removed that from their website. No more Atom discounts for you.
---
Needs to be more like walmart. Christmas stuff avalbile in october.
---
Good advice, I kept going thinking I'd get something worthwhile, I did get junk from mole miners so...
---
Eat the rich.
---
Yeah, having proper PvP mechanics and not this joke Bethesda has created.
---
It was really odd, thought I'd done something wrong, I'll get ore elsewhere.
---
Yeah I dont fuck with workshops on public servers anymore.
---
They go to me üòÅ
---
Id also like to see a new backpack that fits with the ranger armor. Theres backpacks that look okay with it, but id really like to see something specifically designed for it.
---
agreed even this week where i had the whole thing down 100% went in with some people that already done it a lot if you dont get every pipe and hit on all cylinders. nothing you get nothing. Timers suck
---
I dont really use UF anymore for legendaries, i use it for a quick steel run.
---
Also on PCs NW is infested with cheaters, while adventure servers are free of them...
---
Cap issue?
---
Put on your excavator, run WS cottages and the laundry building.  
---
take everything the critters drop, and pick up every item you can.
---
Do the outside area of blackwater.  kill, loot, and pick up everything. hop on the roof of the mine entrance and check for a bobblehead.
---
Goto the trainstation bot vendor, hard bargain3, grape mentats.  Sell everything you just looted.
---
Exchange the legendaries you don't want.
---
Put the bobblehead in your vendor for 50-75 caps.
---
Do that 2x, and you'll likely be at your daily cap limit.
---
Level 50. That way you can use them at the Purveyor
---
Fair enough, wanted to make sure I wasn't missing a trick - Only Dense I've got so far is Trapper from an Ash waste Vendor
---
Cant make a new one , atleast i could not when my sub expired
---
I would not mind some patch insights. That would at least mean there is a patch coming before the end of this year.
---
Well, it's their job to keep thing interesting *somehow*, not necessarily with Wastelanders stuff, so that players don't go play other games like they are already doing.
---
I keep getting into the same 4-5 servers every time I try to server hop. Europe PS4 doesn't seem to have a healthy playerbase rn.
---
I picked up a bloodied meat hook in there this weekend. Only 1*, and I know it‚Äôs all RNG, but it‚Äôs enough to keep me farming there. Good luck to you.
---
I do retaliate to every claim attempt, but pvpers are generally cool; only met maybe two or three true griefers since beta... Playing on PC btw.
---
&gt;not freeloaders that do nothing but make it harder sorry
---
Harder how?
---
Respectfully disagree
---
straight out of the vault to the purveyor (fast travel on friend) and set up camp. So basically level 2. The carry weight is IMHO not so important since you have a stash box. 
---
Tbh, that location is a bit dangerous for a level 2. I do not get online with that one for more than 5 minutes, so I don't mind. Best location would be in a green zone near an unlimited container, so you can transfer items quickly and relatively safe.  
---
I made a bunker with concrete floors all around since it holds a lot of good stuff. :-)
---
I figured some would. You should play destiny. That‚Äôs the game for sweat and stress raids.
---
I'm not convinced that the plan to build wood armor exists; I was looking for it for a very long time. You just have to find or buy the armor.
---
If you could get the plans from novice I suppose that would be sort of an okay solution.
---
bethesda as an easy 15$ permonth answer for that
---
As someone with close to 1k hours in the game playing since beta, this is the only endgame content I see, aside from plan collecting and what have you. As such I enjoy the difficulty, artificial or not. My squad and I can clear all 3 weeks on expert with ease, so in my opinion they dont need to be adjusted bc they're fine as is. I find the completion itself the real reward, going from thinking meltdown is impossible to finding it one of the easiest and entertaining of the 3 raids is quite the journey, for example.
---
Stealthboys does not guarantee you being unVATSable
---
Some people are assholes. Even someone in my party chat let me know about a legendary i used a tesla with all perks off to get a hit on everything. I was not on their team and solo so had to get a shot on everything. When he called it i sprayed the tesla in hopes of getting it since it was already low life. Well he didnt get the legendary but neither did I.  
---
He Thought i got it so he decided to go and run and shoot every legendary first no matter what and kill it.   What a dick.   its like those people when playing friendly fire matches and accidentally get killed by their own team so they go hunt that person down and kill them on purpose.  
---
Some people are just assholes. They know it.
---
Its bad and you should feel bad
---
Thank you for elaborating.
---
I tried the journey, but I just were unable to find the challenge challenging and resulting satisfaction satisfying. But that's me, and I'm not the one who assumes they operate on the single valid perspective.
---
Not understanding your point. A 2* TSE is not the same item as a 3* TSE and not all 3*TSE dragons are the same because there are multiple 3rd stars.
---
I ran UF last night with one other person, at the very end about a half a dozen people showed up but by then it was too late. We waved each other over every time an enemy spawned and hit them with a smaller weapon before killing them...got a level 20 unyielding leather chest piece +1 endurance and a two shot missile launcher...
---
One of the other things I do is, after you take a workshop, spawn in and at the closest point to where you spawn build a stash box so you will remember to get your junk every time you come to the workshop that way it minimizes the chance that some d-bag will get your junk
---
If you're over 18 I'll go on with you sometime xD I'm a high level though but I enjoy helping new players :)
---
Workshops are PvP zones, and have been since launch. I don't know what you expected.
---
&gt;I would like to calculate an actual number for this but I agree, it's doubtful that it's 500,000.
---
Try this on (based on data from the fandom wiki weapon and legendary effect lists):
---
There are around 40 melee base weapon types that can drop as legendaries, with 18 primary, 4 secondary and 6 tertiary legendary effects, i.e. 40\*18\*4\*6=17280 legendary 3\* melee weapons.
---
There are around 50 ranged base weapon types, with 22 primary, 7 secondary and 9 tertiary legendary effects, i.e. 69300 legendary 3\* ranged weapons.
---
There are about 100 base armor types (including light/sturdy/heavy differences), with 18 primary, 11 secondary and 13 tertiary effects, i.e. 257.400 legendary 3\* armors.
---
That's a total of around 344.000 legendary 3\* items. The numbers are not entirely correct because I've ignored things like Explosive not being available on energy weapons anymore and things like that. But still, for doing guesstimates about drop rates, 344.000 or even 350.000 is close enough to the bitter truth.
---
Holiday items are coming soon, no worries! :)
---
Last time I played bodies were disappearing within seconds, is that still happening?
---
meanwhile hunter/hunted is a ghost town;  can i ever even *start* a damn match?
---
I think you have to meet whatever damage threshold is in place to get loot from the queen. I‚Äôve been leveling an alt and have experienced this same thing. Just tagging the queen gives no loot and no flux/repair kits.  I burn a ~1000 or so .50 cal rounds from a plain 50 cal and that seems to be enough

Tbh, they should‚Äôve been here Tuesday. Not saying I‚Äôm not gonna get it this time around cause there‚Äôs always next year too and I fully intend to be around, but I want to get the most out of it, ya know?
---
Couriers could still be a thing yes? Mailmen are not a dead job at all. Even Cass agrees. You dont mess with the person who brings the mail. Obviously its well known that couriers are hardened by the wastes.
---
It might be Vault Tek blue, but there will something slightly off to make it annoying.
---
I'm closer to 2k hours than I am to 1k hours and I still find timers extremely unrewarding thing to beat.
---
Or how about a loot all mechanism.
---
Yeah that one drives me absolutely mental smh.
---
Don't know if this helps you but when bodies disappear they tend to go back to the original spawn point. So if you know where that is you can hopefully find your legendary.
---
You're so right dude, sadly..
---
They should fix the lag and technical issues, not nerf the difficulty by removing timers. Fortunately, there is a reasonable chance that the Wastelanders update will bring some improvements, as it relies heavily on instancing tech (same as used in Vault 94), and it would be difficult to sell the game if the lag was not fixed.
---
Glad to hear the X and S are both contenders for performance. I have read that FPS can make a difference in competitive play. I think it also depends on the TV's refresh rate as well. I read that the X will auto optimize to your TV's performance.
---
Sounds like the damage drops off now over distance then being the major change - yes I noticed that damage vs. SBQ isn‚Äôt that great when she‚Äôs flying.
---
Best was an AAE .50 cal. Everything else is going back in the machine.
---
Not too bad. I got a Bloodied/+10% damage/faster reload Fixer and a few things to sell. And days of scrip. How about you?
---
Awesome, just need to hope it actually goes through.
---
or maybe just search reddit, someone asked the exact same question 3 hours before your post, stop the spam please
---
That's great feedback on building a gaming PC. I have been out of it for so long my assumptions are outdated.  
---
I added the PS  Pro to the list. Good catch.
---
alternatively, add the incendiary effect to the legendary effect pool so we can get burning effects on other weapons. I was honestly surprised that Perfect Storm is the only weapon that has it.
---
agree 100% on the alien blaster though. the in-game one is worthless outside aesthetics.
---
Nobody tell them about supply drops
---
Well I just like being human to others even if I‚Äôm the one taking the hits both In game and IRL. Got a couple of shity years and I‚Äôve lost close friends to drugs so I‚Äôve been trying to make new ones online. There not dead, just beonde my help.  I keep my mind busy on fo76. It‚Äôs my 5 year plan now and 1 year has gone and I‚Äôm still motivated. Fallouts have all ways been the greatest, even though 76 has had lots of downs, but that‚Äôs life and it‚Äôs overcoming obstacles that makes us stronger. 
---
PS. I‚Äôm not into all that trading so I know I‚Äôll probably keep your legacies safe if you decide to come back.
---
was busy pretty much the whole week so i missed out completely. shame, i stocked up on script too.
---
A friend of mine sent me some spreadsheets so I'm actually hoping to generate some numbers using an analytics program. How the 3\* items get rolled is supposedly this:  
---
\-Item Type (basically had a 1/3 chance, Armor, Ranged, Melee)   
---
\-Then which item  
---
\-Then Legendary effects A then B then C  
---
Armour obviously has the worst odds because it has the most combinations.
---
Definitely damage drop-off with distance, maybe a tweak to beam splitter too, but since the main issue with this weapon was that it could obliterate a pixel-sized opponent in second, I consider fixing these weapons damage drop-off a major balance adjustment.
---
Simply put, these weapons were OP bullshit and when we did prearranged events we quite often banned them from being used, and now we don't give a damn, they're weapons just as any other weapons, and if people want to use them we're not against.
---
There's reports that you get flagged as soon as the "Take X workshop" pops up as a quest. You become killable to other players as long as that's an active quest in your queue.
---
I haven't tested it, but a lot of people were talking about it a few weeks ago in another thread.
---
the mission is to protect them until the event ends.
---
after that, what happens to them doesn't matter.
---
Either idea would be great tbh, I would like an Incendiary effect added to the legendary pool!
---
Garbage
---
Datamined already 4th Star is shit like poison/burn dmg
---
Yea thanks man you to
---
I can't be free states turned raider?
---
I have a similar situation. I started carrying a primed gun to do more damage with my second support player and now consistently get the flux and repair kits.
---
It seems like looting the queen is a lower damage threshold than getting full rewards.
---
probably because it was false info
---
AND MY AXE!!!
---
Mmm, Prime Rib... (I always kill and take the meat, since I‚Äôm eternally bumping into my max carry weight)
---
I haven't played since the first two weeks when raids were absolute garbage, so I assume they are at least a little more playable since then. My issue with the timers is they don't achieve their intended purpose, at least not for the right reasons. It doesn't add a real challenge to the game, it punishes you for shitty servers (beyond your control) and essentially forces you into min-maxed bloodied builds. You can probably do it with a different build if you get lucky enough with the times and are decent at the game, but solo you're pretty much fucked unless you have a min-maxed build and one of the top tier legendaries that are always the #1 priority for duping. If the challenge was more about skill than horrible servers and pushing endless waves of tanky meatshields with pitiful exp rewards at you, i wouldnt mind the timer. But in its current state, it needs to go
---
The only interesting thing I got was a Berserker Exploding 50 cal
---
Everything else went to the vending machine or got scrip'd
---
&gt; going from thinking meltdown is impossible to finding it one of the easiest and entertaining of the 3 raids 
---
I had a similar realization and I‚Äôm glad to see somebody else thinking the same. I think Meltdown actually has the most interesting mechanics that require some quick thinking and adaptability in Agriculture and Pump Control. 
---
None of the other raids come close.
---
If you have excess aid items put up a vendor machine and a super low price. Other players will clean you out and give you weightless caps in exchange. Ammo does not move quite as fast and by low price I mean about what you can sell it to the vendor bots for not the marked value which is 4-8 times higher.
---
Scrap your excess weapons and armor or sell them to the vendor bot, players do not care unless it is legendary with good perks.
---
If you do not have acid you can try selling your ore at one cap each. I have offloaded excess ore I did not need that way when I was selling the acid for three to four caps. I have sold a couple hundred ore at one cap, which is funny since I rarely can sell the final scrap you get from smelting the ore at two caps (for instance aluminum, but 2 caps is the cheapest you should sell it at as it will eventually sell to a needy player at that price easily).
---
You are using VERY flawed logic and numbers, so while you may be right, it's going to be in that broken clock twice a day kind of way.
---
Only VIRTUALLY bad, as they are not real Brahmin
---
There‚Äôs a valley next to kiddie corner cabins or whatever near grafton. Me and a buddy spent a good 3 hours yesterday leveling a mule and farming meat as the radstags and Yao guai were multiple endless spawns.  
---
Sometimes like 30 radstags and 10 bears running around at a time. Kill them all run across the lake and they came back. It was crazy. What‚Äôs also crazy is the server wasn‚Äôt laggy as far as moving and shooting, but looting was all delayed a few seconds.
---
A lot of people also once said that other players could steal stuff from you via the trade menu and that turned out to be garbage.  Just because a lot of people are saying it, doesn't make it true.
---
Maybe there's a new bug.  I don't know.  But I will require a lot more proof than a lot of people talking about it before I accept it as fact.
---
Apart from the last [ITV](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5POGB2AdrZDMt1vR9LXQNf/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-happy-thanksgiving) , none.
---
Someone needs to pay for all those airdrops.
---
Try august
---
The Enclave needs funding *somehow*...
---
Yeah... that's a conservative figure. Conservative figures, speaking of which, have made this place a shithole for much longer than 25 years. Were you under the impression mining families being exploited lived in mansions? Think more mud from unpaved roads and one room 'houses' approximately the size of your average toolshed. That was for the people with the best working-class jobs available.
---
It hasn't really improved.
---
I agree there's a lot of duped items, my contention is with the way you arrived at that conclusion :p Even 1 in 400,000 doesn't make sense. The odds for melee, ranged and armor are all completely different. Two bloodied explosive handmades with reload speed aren't statistically that unlikely. Rough numbers as per another poster:
---
"There are around 50 ranged base weapon types, with 22 primary, 7 secondary and 9 tertiary legendary effects, i.e."
---
If working solely with the purveyor that's a 1 in 69300 chance. Though even that calculation isn't really accurate because not every weapon can have every affix. Energy weapons can't have the explosive affix for example. That doesn't mean you have a higher chance of getting that specific handmade, it just means you're calculating possibilities down to the final result which is unnecessary. In this way "1 in 69300" is also disingenuous because if flamers had 1000 extra affixes that no other weapon had it would have 0 affect on whether you could get a specific type of handmade because your chance of any handmade is 0% if you don't first roll that in a 50 item draw.
---
Ah ok. That actually might be it. I just let him run in when she lands, get a few good swipes in with his AA Deathclaw gauntlet and then he runs back to cover. Ill make sure he fights a little more &amp; see what happens.
---
Thats a bummer
---
I want that Santa outfit , Beth don't disappoint :) My Junk collector wants one too lol..
---
Well they ended the radio silence after Fallout 1st recently, so perhaps there will be more in the future.
---
Zilch.
---
Basically there isnt much. QuakeCon was when we had more info, but it hasnt changed much. Id check out the Inside the Vaults that they have. A week ago or so they released pictures of places that they're working on. No date or solid story line has been released yet.  Still in the dark about a lot of it. They did say that this month they would be releasing more pics and info on it tho.
---
Can anyone confirm if this has anything to do with Luck? I legit ignore safes because I‚Äôm sick of silver/gold (watches) and cloth (useless money). My Luck is at 7.
---
Got a bloodied 33%VHC 25%LVC handmade &amp; Bloodied 25%FFR 25%LVC Assault rifle between 2 characters &amp; 2000 script. Rest was complete garbage.
---
If they put a low chance of getting the plans into novice mode than maybe more people would try out the Raids. As it is now though the timers are the reason most people, I have talked to, do not play the Raids.
---
It's not a unique weapon, it's a standard 10mm smg with the incendiary effect. The fixer actually is its own weapon, with a different model and a unique non-legendary effect applied to it.
---
It's I believe only a 4* effect, which is shockingly still not available in the game yet. Maybe wastelanders will bring it in. 4* and 5* effects were already datamined to be in the game and adjusted from their fallout 4 counterparts back in January. Most quest reward weapons in the game have effects or effect combinations that are not normally possible, hence what makes these weapons in any way valuable. The one that's just a AA .44 pistol is useless. The perfect storm or all rise or bunker buster are unique in providing something you can't get otherwise
---
1. Craft a bunch of stuff first so you don't sell anything you need.
---
2. Make sure there's no "junk" in the stash as it weighs more than scrap. Pull everything out of the stash and scrap it all then put it back.
---
3. Bulk a bunch of scrap to sell and then sell it
---
4. Go into your stash box after you've sold whatever and take out anything extra.. for example, I don't think waste antiseptic and a few others are bulkable, I had thousands of it and when I went to clear it out it dropped my stash weight a ton.
---
5. Don't store ammo or anything like that, I only keep .45, Ultracite 5.56 rounds and a few fusion cores on me. I'll typically go to a low lever players camp drop all my extra ammo and emote them over.
---
Hope this helps.
---
You mean the Walmarts in your areas ever took them down??
---
I've read many times before that luck only affects the durability of the items you pick up. Higher luck means higher durability. I've also read many times that it has no effect on rewards/legendary rng.
---
5 people? No. But I wouldn't go as high as 500.
---
BGS is stingy with releasing info so I‚Äôm doing the best with what is available.
---
My waving 3 waving Santas have never left my camp, their singing is a fixture of my CAMP every day of the year
---
I do about 1000 points damage (using the visual damage indicator in settings) .  That is a good target.

According to math during mischief night it was around 14k playing at any given time I think
---
I agree that the matching making could be harder. I assume it would be like matchmaking for GTA Online Heists. It will be a complete crapshoot who you get. 
---
If you‚Äôre a 3 man group looking to fill the 4th match making could be good fun though.

Communication is always good.

I think I have these 2 plans I keep with me for giving them to low level players (or at least I am sure I have 2 different walls plans) I can give u for free
---
vault 94 is a raid dungeon that i wouldn't recommend trying to solo on any level higher than novice, which is a shame cuz you don't get the better rewards on novice. there's also The Burrows which is basically just the sewers under Harper's Ferry, but that really has no replay value to my knowledge. kinda fun the first run through tho. and if you just want new stuff, the airport in morgantown was restructured to be more interesting for new players, has new notes and lore, and you get a plan for a small backpack. could be worth a look. idk how long you've been gone but in case it's been a long while i'll mention the train station outside Berkly Springs is now a Legendary item vendor. just scrap unwanted legendaries at any legendary scrapper (at any train station) and she'll give you a random legendary based on how many scrips you pay.
---
there's also the nuclear winter mode that does have lore but you have to find the notes and terminals in Vault 51, which is a lobby so you're only in there like three minutes at a time, and even if you find it it's locked behind your NW level. if you care about the 51 lore, i'd just watch Oxhorn's video on it.
---
I have a bunch of broken cameras. You need to craft one at a tinkers bench. Go to a terminal and find the missing person quest. It‚Äôll give you one. Otherwise it is in the world randomly.
---
Not really worried about missing stuff, just wanted to do stuff with others :) F4 is, to me, a great single player experience, wanted to enjoy F76 as a multiplayer one.
---
I don't believe that what you do in the fight effects what the rewards are, other than the pass/fail of doing enough damage - the drops should be the same as long as you get on the loot list and complete the 'quest'.
---
That said, it's hard to say without looking at the loot tables (dataminers might be able to chime in there), but I don't know that flux or repair kits are *guaranteed* to be part of the reward.  But as far as I can tell, nothing has changed in the last week or so, I'm still getting both, but I don't know if I get both *all* the time (I don't look that closely).
---
I got the crappiest weapons ever during the sale. My first legendary at full price was the best legendary I've ever got.
---
If you are shopping for them other players have bought regular nuka at 5 caps, cherry at 10 caps, and quantum at 25 caps. Sometimes you can sell large shipments to particular buyers at higher prices but those seem to be the prices they move rapidly at for me.
---
My second character is going to be a nuka freak as they are an incredible healing item in my opinion, particularly with the perk. And you get slightly richer every time you drink one.
---
Bethesda, do other devs release broken, incomplete, unpolished, unfinished games? Please don't release games in that state yourself.
---
This ‚ÄòDatamine‚Äô you refer to has been around since the game came out.. it is just as likely that the 4-5th stars that were data-mined were cut content as they are future content...
---
 Would like to see 4-5th stars down the line.. we need more powerful creatures to scale with our levels for stuff like that tho!
---
I horde so much resources that I bought fallout 1st to horde more.
---
I‚Äôm in the exact same boat as you playtime wise. I‚Äôm well enough equipped on all my characters to beat the raid even without my friends; and I STILL don‚Äôt like the timers.
---
I have mine for sale for 5076 caps, but no takers and it's been a couple weeks. But I put the White Power one up for the same price and it sold within minutes, so idk
---
Lots of good stuff for my vendors, but nothing for me personally.  90% crap, 10% salable items.  I'll probably net about 75K caps or a bit more from sales.
---
Weapon is great.  Obviously you will want Heavy Gunner perks, Stabilized, and Bloody Mess for max damage potential.   Since it is explosive, demo expert helps a bit as well though the overall percentage it adds doesn't really compare to the other damage perks.  Personally I would go 6 INT with 3 demo and 3 stabilized.
---
The downside to the LMG is ammo cost.  It chews through .308 at an extreme rate and .308 has horrid crafting stats.  Ammo Smith and Super Duper are must haves for any build.
---
The bright side of a Heavy Guns build is that you are going to have a bundle of points in Strength.  Invest in melee perks so you can go hands on and conserve ammo where appropriate.  Optionally grab some other Heavies like a Gatling Laser or .50 cal to blow easier to squire ammo.  Save the LMG for end game content.
---
I agree. They're difficult as it is, but then you add in crashes and lag and all the other malarky....  They don't need timers.
---
I blame super mutants, damn things are always loaded
---
My thoughts exactly!
---
yea, took me a while as well.  For the more expensive ones, best I could get (from bot vendors, anyway) was about 5880.
---
If you are on PS4, I think I have a few mods on hand for various types.
---
spend money on decorations, what a joke this sub is.
---
I wish the legendary machine would take my crap even when it has less remaining coins than the item value ( i.e. it would allow to sale a *** weapon for 35 coins instead of 40 if that is all the machine has left for the day ).
---
In addition to the minimum damage threshold, if you do meet it and get the flux, you can still lose the flux if you die before fast-traveling away from the SBQ site. I've gotten to the point where I make a beeline for whatever FO1st tent is placed nearby and stash my flux before fighting that last wave of scorched adds that follow the queen's death.
---
Lots of people just want to level fast. They miss all this, and say the game is empty.
---
haha if you mean age, I'm well over 18 :D In terms of level I'm only 4 :(
---
How do I find you ?
---
Some of the perks I run include-
---
All three heavy weapon perks, bear arms, lock and load, stabilized, bloody mess, and one gun army.
---
The stabilized perk gives let‚Äôs you ignore 45% armor while in power armor, so only get that perk if you use P.A.
---
Not sure if I‚Äôm missing any, but I can 3-4 shot lv 68 super mutants with headshots and a two shot Gatling gun
---
Ohhh I'll "search" for them then - thanks for the tip!
---
Ah sadly I'm PC but thanks for the offer!
---
not sure about the "backup". if you ditch it you can go all in on your commando build and do considerably more damage with criticals. That would mean to go strength 1 and max out luck for critical savy and better criticals. I would also recommend specing in vats, so you would want concentrated fire, gun fu (rank 1 will do) and grim reapers sprint. adrenaline will also fit nicely. white knight is not necessary as you dont want to take damage as a stealth build anyway
---
I'm on Xbox so don't worry about me.
---
It's nice to see people like you. It's too bad you are leaving the gaming community but I understand. I injured my back at a young age so my wife and my games are all I have. Too bad I'm bad with both üòÇ
---
This right here. You‚Äôre right Papa_Shekels. You always have a fairly balanced view on things Fallout 76 related. Glad we can agree on this man.
---
Yea, I liked the Perfect Storm, but at the time, didn't know about waiting to complete the quest to get a higher level reward.... so mine was L15.
---
Would be nice to have as a L50 :)
---
I'm in that same location, I bet. And I deal with it too.
---
I moved my first camp on the River with a junk node because it was always taken. So I moved north so I could sit on both those nodes.
---
 Now I'm considering moving my camp again and just sit on Lead, and let my Collectron worry about picking up junk for me. 
---
Probably somewhere in the Mire... But I've been hesitant to move there, as that area creeps me the fuck out. 
---
I'm not normally one to get creeped out at games or anything, and I love the forest/woods areas. But something about that place...just weirds me out man.
---
3 snally gasters &lt; 10 crickets
---
would buying them count for the possum collection badge that requires me to find all the flavors?
---
Maths! lol :-D
---
I recently saw someone this subreddit saying they'd like to have a group to play with, so I messaged them and hopped into his world, I then proceeded to ask them about what they'd like to do in the game, such as what build they wanted, weapons and so on. They didn't have a back pack so we went over to the airport and got them the small one, then I proceeded to help them get the regular backpack, by helping them step by step in getting everything they needed, and after about 2 hours, they got the regular backpack at level 36, and to set them on their way, I made and dropped them 1,500 5.56 ammo, a decent handmade and 1,500 caps, all without asking for anything in return because being able to help others, even if it's just a game, or through voice chat, means more to me than getting something in return.
---
Drop Good Doggy, Hard Bargain, Scrounger, pharma pharma.  Use those points elsewhere and swap those in only as needed.  And do you need iron fist at all?
---
I'd personally drop White Knight too, it's not that big a deal to keep up with repairs.
---
Not a particularly deep review, but that's where I'd start at least.  I'd go more points in Perception and possibly luck if you have the points to spend.
---
I wouldn't mind a fixed game.
---
*Atoms. Nothing else to spend them on
---
Thanks for the info! I‚Äôm hoping they adjust the .308 ammo production soon
---
&gt;Ammo Smith and Super Duper are must haves for any build.
---
Note: Not as 'every day' perks, but have them to swap in *as needed*.  Don't run with those into fights.
---
Buy lv1 weapon weight reduction armor or pull from the purveyor with your mule.  Container transfers work for items - not so safe before 1st but now you can rejoin your private server.
---
had it but it just didn't do enough damage to take down harder opponents.  Maybe a higher level would have worked. I think I had the explosive perks active at that time.  Also lacking a scope just was annoying since I had camoflauge.
---
Don't forget to prime it.
---
West-Tek will give you a bunch of xp
---
Sometimes that‚Äôs hard to find if you don‚Äôt know where they spawned
---
How would you calculate the number of 3* that have dropped in game since launch?
---
Fasnacht is timeless.
---
Hi, i want Items
---
Went in with 800 odd scrip, chasing better armor, for the most part.  Got some that may be decent, but need to start modding to bring up the DR.
---
Most of weapons I got...back into the machine.  pipe pistol, flaming pitchfork.  Nothing god tier, nothing explosive.
---
That doesn‚Äôt always work when bodies get blown to pieces, or a body disappears back to the spawn and you don‚Äôt know where it is. Or in the mire if it ends up under water. Or legendary robots that don‚Äôt have flies.
---
I'm not taking requests anymore, so the items will be random
---
I agree. That trade bug was bogus AF. But that's why I prefaced it by saying I hadn't tested it. It's not so ridiculous as to be blatantly untrue, but until I see it, I'm not inherently going to trust it.
---
Oof
---
Most of the unique quest reward weapons end up being useless on your first character since you'll always get them well below level 50.
---
I would like to see a few things happen with them:
---
1. Make all unique/named items weightless in the stash
---
2. Make it so you can use them as an ingredient to craft a higher level of themselves (Like the Mistress of Mystery gear)
---
3. Make it so that you have a way to get them back if you accidentally scrap or sell them.
---
I would argue since there is no other incendiary effect in the game like the one on the Perfect Storm.. it therefore is a unique weapon.. even if initially I never said that..  said ‚Äúkinda similar‚Äù to the fixer.. both rewarded by quests.. both have a unique effect not found else where on other weapons, has a name.. 
---
Other guns and weapons fit into this category sure.. there‚Äôs even a shotgun that gives you +5 ap called civil arrest or something like that.. but they would b rather pointless to add, and all rise wouldn‚Äôt work.. bunker buster maybe but I don‚Äôt think it would really improve the state of RPGs..
---
Perfect storm, don‚Äôt think anyone can argue it wouldn‚Äôt be fun to run around with a legendary kickass Submachine gun.. since subbys pretty much suckü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
you know damn well they'll wait to the last minute to do something if anything at all.
---
**On a side note...** I did notice a Christmas tree underwater under the broken bridge up near the Mothman Museum.
---
I can one/two shot most enemies in the game with a mediocre gun and fairly fine tuned build. When a really tough enemy needs to be brought down its still a fairly simple task, even solo. Getting a godroll is irrelevant as things stand right now. If overall the difficulty will be raised a few levels a good roll will become viable, until then there's no real incentive to work for one.
---
To add to that, Survival was free, Private Worlds are paid. There were fewer Survival instances than there are Private World instances. Bethesda added volume and didn't simply "trade" one tiny set of instances for a much higher number of them.
---
14k - across all platforms, during a peak event, and that assuming that everyone did the event only once per hour and that all servers were full. The real figure, today, is much lower than that.
---
Still, I will give you 14k. That is an *extremely* low number for an 'AAA' (I don't really believe F76 should be considered AAA though) title with only a year of life. Freaking Brawlhalla has more players than that. Battlefield 1, a 4 year old title, has more players than that.
---
If you were an investor, you would know just how bad that number is for this game.
---
I didn't say the servers I go to are empty, though.
---
I meant age, I don't really care about your level :P My gamertag is DrUnknownShot if you want to find me
---
On my third char I made a point to not do any unique rewards quests until I hit level 50, so I'm nearing a complete collection of max level reward armor and weapons that I will display at some point. Here's hoping Beth eventually lets us display armor so I can put Silver Lining, Trail Warden etc out for viewing with the weapons.
---
I use to have one but sold it. It was an excellent weapon but I got tired of a heavy weapons build and .308 ammo is a pain and it eats it just like the MG42 it is based on. Ideal build is heavy weapons ideally with stabilized which of course means PA (another reason I dumped, don't like PA - clunk clunk). You could prime it for SBQ only fights too. I use an AA FFR Automatic Railway Rifle with commando build for that. Fires 10 rounds in a split second with resulting criticals around 2500 HP, and a prime TSE 10 mm SMG for mopping up the scorched. Ammo is cheap and easy and I can avoid PA.
---
I actually did this with Bunker Buster and Perfect Storm so I had Max level variants, it‚Äôs unfortunate that they‚Äôre just not too useful tho
---
That sounds like a cool collection tho dude!üëçüèº
---
With pleasure, once  i am online  i wiƒ∫l post
---
You think so? Seems pretty good compared to what you see on something like COD. I don‚Äôt play those anymore but remember black ops only having like 1200 playing 6 months after release or so. 
---
You said only 5 people are playing on a server...
---
Why scrounged? I‚Äôll be going thru ammo pretty fast
---
There are also locations where you can get bags of chlorine which have 5 acid per bag I think. One location in the bean stalk event.
---
PS I sold it within 1 hour for 25K
---
same
---
There is no real incentive to work for anything in this game. All incentive is player generated.
---
Thanks, I might need a headset then. I do have a controller keyboard, but it's not the same thing :)
---
Where do I do this "Looking for Group" post thing?
---
I farm events and set spawn encounters so it helps me a little more than people who run the burrows or west tek
---
I think I sell these plans in my vendor. PS4
---
Thanks! Yeah it's counter-intuitive because some of that stuff, like Somerset Special and Perfect Storm, can be extremely useful at low levels. Not much good to a well-supplied veteran Wastelander but it's cool to have them anyway. I've still got a few to go, know for sure I'm missing Pyrolyzer and Daisy Cutter. Maybe a few others.
---
they implied that the Wastelanders plot occurs a year after the base game plot, and outright said people "came back". so the human npcs are people who either abandoned appalachia and returned after we made it safer, or people who just showed up looking for a new home. nothing is getting rewritten.
---
Pyrolyzer is another cool one they should do! Didn‚Äôt think about that one..
---
i could really use some clean socks
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBZTIKfT-S8
---
True on that! I hope they won't patch this one
---
No worries my man! ;)
---
Whhaaattt?
---
how does someone hoarding more wood and plastic than me make them better at the game?
---
When was that? With CoD2? Because right now, Black Ops 3, Black Ops 4, WW2, and Modern Warfare all have way more players than Fallout 76. Sorry, but 14k is something one would expect from an slightly popular indie game - like Squad or Insurgency. Not from a Fallout game from Bethesda.
---
"I keep getting into the same 4-5 servers every time I try to server hop" - I didn't say anything about 5 people.
---
One thing that helps with ammo is to put a prime receiver on it. The ultracite .308 crafts in much larger batches than the regular rounds. Only downside is it takes a florescent flux for each batch you craft. I have a TSE LMG with the prime reciever and I love it, melts scorchbeasts like butter with the heavy gun perks, stabilized and bloody mess
---
I wouldnt bother with the whole backup idea. Try something like this instead https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f643fb&amp;d=pg2ph2pi2pp2a72ar2l71eo2an2ao0i12lt2p02eh2c72a04lu2sg1lv2&amp;w=&amp;m=c519f&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
I'm on a bit of a break right now but just before I stopped I nabbed All Rise and man did that bring back some memories from my first month with the game. I didn't care much for legendary grinding at the time (still don't but it is what it is, gotta do it). My friends I was playing with also didn't really appreciate that the grind IS the game, so we thought the stuff you got as rewards was the peak of weapons and armor LOL. We were all running around in Ultracite PA with All Rise, fighting scorchbeasts LOL. It worked tho.
---
I see lots of opinions in the replys, but very little facts. this issue may well be worth testing ( I havn't). but by all accounts, those that have, do report the increased difficulty when other players (regardless of level ) turn up.
---
My point is that just because you have a specific mathematical chance to get something, doesn't mean you will, or will not get more, RNG is just that... Random.
---
And 3 out of 4 of those Dragons were 90% Reduced Weight.
---
I once received 3 identical drops from Uranium Fever (Mutant's Tire Iron, with Swing Speed &amp; Reduced weight), I promptly sold them to a vendor in fear of being branded a duper.
---
Are you sure that's correct? I may be wrong but i thought it was just the newer weapons they added (fixer, bear arm, etc) that this applied to. As i say i could be wrong though. 
---
Either way, I'd recommend getting a fixer plan on that character ASAP, I got a great legendary fixer during a recent sale and it immediately became my favourite weapon.
---
Spent about 1500 scrip and nearly everything went back into the machine. No Fixers, no Sheepy weapons, no good Junkie's weapons. Got a Quad Railway Rifle and that's about it.
---
Last sale had much better rolls for me. That's life in this game.
---
Yeah I decided to opt out of it but I certainly want to keep scrounged so I can find ammo easily
---
Also, I've found it depends on which workshops you take. The people that take out other players at a workshop are after two things, your resources and a quick kill. If you go claim the workshops that have ammo, fusion cores, lead or canned food, you're more likely to get attacked. The PvP players looking for an easy kill will server hop at the workshops in the forest looking for someone low level to take out. If you claim one of the remote workshops in the ash heap, mire or bog, you're less likely to get attacked.
---
Of course, getting killed by another player is no big deal anyway, so don't let that stop you from taking workshops. Stash your junk and don't fight back. You'll lose 50 caps which is just fast travel money. Hide until they server hop and then you can claim it back. I don't bother being stealthy any more and still have only gotten attacked a couple of times. And honestly, it was kind of fun.
---
Is it a skin for the paper bag you can drop?
---
I hate timer mechanics with a passion
---
I loved my perfect storm and used it for a lot of levels. It would be a great idea to have it with 3*.
---
You can't is part of the point I was making (because you said there shouldn't exist more than 3 or 4 of an item). It should also be understand that once these items exist in the game they can only increase in quantity because they aren't being destroyed. The game has been live for over a year.
---
That's my point. 
---
You can't use faulty, made up statistics and than claim it as proof of anything.
---
I m looking for a level 50 one n giving away a level 30. My condition for give away is. Pay it forward to the next level 30.
---
Best I'll do is ammo for you
---
Its much easier to craft ammo than try to find it
---
2.5k scrip and I got two TSE .50cals, TSE SMG, a couple AA/FFR weapons and an AA/FFR/+1 per gauss rifle
---
What should I use for those spare 2 points then?
---
And a JE minigun I forgot about lol
---
It is four times more efficient in terms of steel, lead, and gunpowder requirements if you modify the gun to use the prime receiver, and craft ultracite .308 ammo. That obviously also boosts the damage, especially against scorched type enemies. The downside is that you need flux and ultracite. All in all, I think heavy guns and power armor are best for people who farm nuke zones and Scorched Earth.
---
Not at all. In fact, I only sell junk, ammo, plans, legendary items and gunpowder. Everything else takes space and doesn't sell. 
---
Stash space is the only precious thing in this game.
---
That story implies that drops aren‚Äôt very random at all.
---
Because it doesn't help your damage.  You swap in that card when you're searching items, and swap it out when you're done.
---
It's not super convenient with scrounger (or other perks that involve searching), so it's up to you whether or not to bother swapping things out all the time.
---
I never used that perk, and really didn't have huge issues with ammo, but it will depend a lot on how much you'll want to be farming.  Eventually you'll probably just ignore that perk once you're fully operational, once you get good at farming things.  Or, get good at your vendors and just buy ammo (though that's probably a ways down the road).
---
The saddest part is that clearly a lot of love went into the building of Vault 94 but players have to rush through there so quickly to beat the timers that we miss all that work. 
---
As a modder, I would love to just stroll around and admire the layout and cluttering but there's zero chance of that.
---
Quad Explosive combat rifle, which is pretty awesome. Needed a weapon for my sneaky guy for when stuff actually finds me, and this thing fits the bill. Bonus, it uses the same ammo as my Instigating LA, and it seems to have randomly turned that gun into an explosive weapon as well! I don't know how long that will persist, but I enjoyed it during my session last night.
---
Weapons were total trash, but I did manage to get a couple pieces of scout armor that will be useful.
---
This has been happening to me the last few times and there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm not doing enough damage. I‚Äôm using a prime mini gun and prime 50 cal and always use a magazine that does extra 15% to scorched as well as all the chems I use. I stand right in front of her face and do a lot of damage but haven‚Äôt been getting the flux or the repair kits.
---
Honestly, I have good days and bad days, but all my five characters have 800-1000 scrip to spend because I have practically all the items I need/use. 
---
I think all of us have more scrip and caps than free stash space.
---
The .50 cal eats way to much ammo to be viable as a prime. Plus you can't remove the prime receivers from the .50 if you change your mind since they have no default receiver to go to. The plasma would work great. I have a TSE prime plasma and it works amazing on the queen
---
Do you mind? Im busy doing the fishstick. Its a very delicate state of mind!
---
Remember how gta used to have a dialog menu tab? I wonder how diffuclt something like that would be to hot patch in.
---
whether it's worth it really depends on you.
---
for 13 dollars for one month, i get like 16 bucks worth of atoms, a ranger armor suit (plus whatever variant is available that month), and two dance emotes. i am rolling in caps so paying for fast travel means nothing to me, so tent is more of a convenience item for me. i actually enjoy the "social" element of 76 and love people coming to my camp/rest stop to buy things/craft what they need (i put it near morgantown so i get a lot of levels 5-15 starting the game out passing by) so i have no use for the private server outside farming workshops. and i tend to use my scrap to build things to sell almost immediately so the scrapbox won't get much use either.
---
basically, for me the 13 dollar one month sub is enough to get the things i want, and "try out" the things i don't. the actual "services" it gives are meh to me. i don't plan to buy a whole year unless they add more monthly rewards like new emotes or the like, but maybe the monthly atoms and private worlds are enough to justify a year purchase for you?
---
Are you talking about the proof of purchase because that thing sucked or the badge that let you know when you came in. Most people dont even use it.
---
They can decrease, inactive players, traded for scrip, sold, dropped, lost to the void.
---
If more players were mic'd or we had text we could coordinate events better. I hate just running around shooting each enemy once. I feel like I'm leaving all of the work to the other players. 3 star enemies should also drop 3 start loot.
---
What do you mean over 100% core load?
---
Damn...I wonder how many others this is happening to. Bethesda needs to be aware of this.
---
Thanks for the info
---
i'm so mad at myself for not thinking of this. i always forget blueprinting is a thing.
---
I believe these were to be added for the Christmas event. Someone may have cheated a way to get some or the game messed up.
---
Walmarts in my area just rebranded as "Christmas outlet" lol.
---
I got an AAFFR25 gamma gun and Quad FFR gamma gun. Not sure what was with the gamma guns cuz I got like 7, something cool to mess around with I guess. Got some rad rifles that didn't suck, too. I don't usually get anything that is both awesome AND something I will use heh
---
Sounds like what was datamined after the last patch for upcoming holiday event. Don't think they are available yet so maybe it was pulled from the dev room by someone.  Not to sure, I know I haven't seen any on Xbox.
---
I just thought I was being really unlucky but seeing someone else say the same. I‚Äôm running out of repair kits and I did have loads.
---
Thank you so much for sharing this website! It was fun to play with and I really needed some help! Thanks a million!!
---
Interesting, this item was just mentioned in today's ITV, but isn't slated to go live on the 12th.
---
"Each ‚ÄúHoliday Scorched‚Äù you take down will drop a Holiday Gift for you to unwrap. Gifts can be low, medium, or high-quality, and may contain anything from a lump of coal, to rare plans and recipes. You‚Äôll also get some wrapping paper so that you can craft a few Holiday Gifts of your own to share with your fellow Dwellers."
---
No. It was in a different Atom Shop bag.
---
Also check your misc tab. Gunpowder, ores, and if you do silo runs or vault raids, mainframe cores will eat up your stash space pretty quick. Superstims are also wicked heavy. You're better off keeping them in your inventory with traveling pharmacy.
---
I could see that being abused real quickly.
---
I created a character in order to get those unique items after 50. Do you want to know what happened? By then I had 50 better items to keep in the stash. 
---
So... Not worth it. In fact, I used an explosive +vats accuracy reduced weight SMG all my way through Cold case. 
---
The only keepers are the max level Somerset Special and Stand Fast for the stealth bonus.
---
Yep. Posted similar. Stirred up the toxics big time. Apparently I shouldn‚Äôt claim if I don‚Äôt want a pasting. See their point sort of, I was warned that PvP was possible, but it‚Äôs a pretty sh1tty gameplay style imo
---
It seems like a 10% chance to even get milk lol
---
Try one of the LFG's on discord, it may be easier to find people that way.
---
Do you guys think we'll be able to use both at camp or just one or the other?
---
Wait that‚Äôs a thing?
---
Sweet!
---
So will the Christmas NW rewards be like the Halloween in that I should wait until they're all available to start getting XP towards them?
---
I havent receved a single legacy ive been at max caps but thats as far as ive gon i think it wuld he realy cool to have a legacy and caps would help me rn hut im sure some people deserve it more but its worth a try
---
Yes! Getting a little hope now!
---
In that case I‚Äôll stick by my approximations and basic conclusion, The drop rates are so low that duplicate items are best presumed to be duped.
---
Most legendary smgs are better by then.
---
Now this, this is a true ITV...
---
When you repair a weapon with weapon artisan, it's fixed over 100%, its condition gets to 200%
---
You might achieve 200% of core CND with enough intelligence, which means twice the ammo per core.
---
Yeah dude pretty cool of them, it has a santa suit on and collects candy, coal and toys. Definitely better than the base Collectron. I hope we're able to have one of each though
---
Yeah, I was thinking the same after posting it :D
---
It'd take a little more work, but I believe a system could be made that isn't as easily abused. You just have to leverage some mathematics and calculate a few more things, including a way to detect abuse and diminish things with weighting.
---
I would say so... kinda silly way to realease them...
---
Yeah it's really cool of them and seems to be a separate Collectron so we might be able to have both!
---
Haha
---
they explained what the pics were "look a church with vines" "oh a parking garage... thats under watoga" . we got no new info regarding content or changes.
---
Probably just one :( if that is the case I'll probably just keep the Santatron up and live off of candy.
---
Is that available now?
---
2000 scrip all on 3* armor. Got some quite a few nice scout pieces and a few others that I'm building a trade list for.
---
http://imgur.com/a/A8yeKFy
---
It gives candy, coal, or toys only.
---
All things considered, this was a solid ITV:
---
Free Trial for Noobs
---
Double XP weekend
---
Patch Tuesday
---
Holiday Event that isn‚Äôt just in a single location once an hour
---
S a n t a t r o n
---
Halloween NW rewards are back
---
Holiday NW rewards are starting earlier so we can get everything before Christmas.
---
I‚Äôll TAKE it.
---
And later in the game the monorail location in the south by south east has about 80 lead.
---
A robot... with a beard.  
---
Yep, I'm buildin' that!
---
No, comes with the Christmas update
---
Ok? Well it was enough for me. Personally I would rather wait and experience it all when released. I wouldn‚Äôt want to know everything before it is released.
---
Oh OK, I'm still happy about it either way üôÇ
---
Ok, that's some actually interesting stuff that may make me play again after not playing since Halloween.
---
I've almost given up playing this on public servers.  It's easy enough to solo on a private server.
---
There is also the opposite scenario.  Yesterday I played it and I suspect for everybody else it was their first time.  I'm around 170, everybody else was 40-50.  But they didn't know what to do.  We lost the collectors constantly, nobody would repair them but me, and they could barely fight off the hordes that spawned.  On top of that, one of two of them would just go for the legendaries, who were highly difficult to hit with the swarms we had because of the large # players. I managed to get a single legendary, but after the final legendary was killed by a melee build in the swarm of others, I just fast-traveled away, not worth trying to save all their asses.
---
This is the thing I don't understand, PvP is this game is basically a shit show. If you actually want a Versus game, either play NW, or play one of the many other versus games out there that have done it better.

Here's a fully perked up true stealth commando build - [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1e533ff&amp;d=pg2ph2pi2pp1ar2l71an2ao0lt2cu2p02s00eu0er2ir2la2lk0lv2lu2a51a30a71a02eh0&amp;w=&amp;m=c5102fe3b&amp;nw=&amp;n=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1e533ff&amp;d=pg2ph2pi2pp1ar2l71an2ao0lt2cu2p02s00eu0er2ir2la2lk0lv2lu2a51a30a71a02eh0&amp;w=&amp;m=c5102fe3b&amp;nw=&amp;n=)

When you use unyielding armor pieces and lower your health to reach agility level 30+ almost nothing can spot you and damage you deal is insane, your ammo usage will drop significantly. Rad/energy/poison protection can be bumped up with right armor pieces and food/chems.
---
Ohh this is great - thanks!
---
Don't get me wrong, but it adds variety to my commando. My handmade, Tesla, fixer... All of them have these high tech sights... The SMG keeps it "guerrilla".
---
I feel good about it: it looks rugged, tough, durable. 
---
No bashing molerats with those fragile, pricey recon sights...
---
The real purchase pressure is taking the stuff out of the shop a few weeks later. Never know when this will be back, may as well buy it now! I just wait til things I want are on sale anymore heh
---
More than 14k people are playing BO4 right now?
---
I like Chem Fiend, 30% longer chems with 1\*
---
Great, I'll try to find you later today when I'm playing.
---
toys can be scrapped, candy can be eaten, and i assume true to it's nature as an Xmas gift coal is useless. so, i'm fine with these.
---
You will need to adjust your appearance to FAT!
---
They already told you Wastelanders was delayed until next year and last week's ITV was all about Wastelanders.. Settle down dude!
---
Im pretty sure its not supposed to go live until the 12th. So id leave it the hekk alone. Lol.
---
Can ya pay for my therapy group? Great Lakes recovery?  10 months clean! Cheers!
---
We have receivers for that. I feel your pain, but the game has its own rules.
---
Wait so the holiday event is essentially just hunting down random dressed up scorched that drop presents? That doesn't sound nearly as fun as a structured event. If the rewards are decent won't all the good scorched areas be all farmed out non stop unless you play on a private server?
---
This is actually not bad. At least they keeping the updates steady. Even if it‚Äôs just little things till Wastelanders.
---
Its content thats coming, but i didnt think we were supposed to get until the 12th. So id leave it alone until then.
---
Same. Toys have screws, lead and sometimes plastic. Im all game.
---
Since I like to pillage and grief I am most deserving.
---
Gotta disagree friend. The timers are what inspired out guild raid team to build a dedicated 4 person team, each practice and perfect their SPECIFIC and distinct job in novice, and now they 4 of them expert on farm. Listening to them as they work is a real treat becuase you can recognize the skill and work they put in. They deserve the armor sets that they earned.
---
Yea it‚Äôs pretty common, I always try to take a power plant for the fusion cores and I have had people waiting for me to return.
---
PvP damage "should" be reduced to 110dmg.  So with that said, AAE seems to be the most appropriate.  I've learned of some new tricks like Nuka Quantum spamming, but I think AAE automatic is the goto for PvP.
---
I‚Äôm real happy the bot is free
---
I‚Äôve said this before if I am at that event and someone is hogging the XPs and kills I will absolutely engage them in PvP.
---
Youtubers will make a video on the collection costing $6 but are silent when something good like this happens
---
Double XP is always good news, I put on 15 NW levels during the last one and didn't even play on the last day. I'm glad they are incorporating the original NW map as well just for variety. I think Morgantown is far superior but it's nice to have a choice. I got all my Halloween rewards last time but I'm excited to see what's for Christmas. All in all this is a solid update.
---
Phew. 
---
I've had this bug where I couldn't see a couple of offers in the atom store, one of the Halloween bundles and something else.  So I never really know if everything is out yet.
---
You better watch out, he gives coal too. You better not cry, and I'll tell you why, cause he'll still give ya a toy. Santatron is coming to town
---
I tried my luck, maybe 800 scrip. Tons of shit I gave away and a Bloodied faster swing combat knife which I like but don't use because my 1h melee has gone brawler.
---
It only cost 500 atoms/$5 so sounds like shitty journalism to me lol
---
So here is a rough breakdown of some chances for various items... bit of precursor information:
---
**Any time a 3\* drops there are 5 rolls (you can skip the first one for purveyor):**  
---
\-Item Type (basically a 1/3 chance, Armor, Ranged, Melee)  
---
\-Then Legendary effects A then B then C
---
**Weapons:**  
---
Based on the ranged weapons list here:  
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_weapons](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_weapons)
---
45 ranged weapons with possible legendary effects  
---
22 one handers with possible legendary effects  
---
17 two handers with possible legendary effects  
---
7 unnarmed with possible legendary effects

---
Primary affixes for armor: 18  
---
Secondary affixes for armor: 10  
---
Tertiary affixes for armor: 12  
---
**Scenarios:**  
---
**#1**. What are the odds of a 3\* drop being a two shot explosive handmade with reload speed (assuming that it has already been determined that a 3\* item is dropping)?  
---
3x45x23x7x9= 1 in 195,615
---
What if it's only two shot explosive handmade and who cares about the other affix?  
---
3x45x23x7=1 in 21,735
---
What if you're buying it directly from the purveyor?  
---
Two shot explosive handmade with reload speed: 45x23x7x9 = 1 in 65,205  
---
Two shot explosive handmade: 45x23x7 = 1 in 7,245
---
**#2**. What are the odds of a 3\* drop being unyielding, +str, sentinel combat left arm (remember there are 5 armor slots) from a drop (assuming that drop is going to be 3\*)?  
---
3x19x5x18x10x12=1 in 615,600
---
What if I don't care which armor slot?  
---
3x19x18x10x12=1 in 123,120
---
What if I don't care about the secondary affix or the armor slot?  
---
3x19x18x12=1 in 12,312  
---
What if I bought it from the purveyor? What are my odds of an unyielding, +str, sentinel combat left arm?  
---
19x5x18x10x12=1 in 205,200
---
19x18x10x12=1 in 41,040
---
19x18x12=1 in 4,104
---
Better criticals or four leaf clover. Will really help up your total dps and crit spamming
---
Being that it is the only place to get Grape....
---
Awesome!! Thanks for the info :)
---
At least my teeth still look great.
---
But that's wrong to presume. 
---
How long have you been playing? You've never gotten a duplicate weapon or armor? I have several times. 
---
And I have seen a lot of instances where someone was selling an identical weapon or armor as something I found off of an enemy myself so I know for 100% certain that it hasn't been duped. Not from mine anyway. 
---
Frankly, your numbers of only 3 or 4 of any particular 3 star item on any particular platform are insanely low. 
---
I bet I've looted 1000 3 stars myself in a year. It would only take less than 400 other people doing the same thing to hit the max number of possible legendaries (if for some reason every single one of those was completly unique)  
---
How many of people play this game? Who knows? But I bet it's a lot more than, 1,604 (to use your only 4 per unique combination estimate) 
---
Does duping exist? Of course. But is it really that big of a deal? Probably not since while it may seem like everyone is running around in god level gear, that just isn't the case. If it were that prevalent you'd be able to buy duped legacy weapons for next to nothing everywhere you looked.
---
Given to it? Or in general? The gatling lasers get an incendiary mod
---
positive things that the community actually didn't loudly ask for and are genuine surprise gifts don't bring in the clicks like blind outrage does, unfortunately.
---
Welcome to Fallout, its the same for legendaries.
---
I expected to have the option to surrender the workshop when it was contested so I wasn't forced into PVP.  Thanks Bethesda.
---
Use punctuation, ffs
---
So how‚Äôs it break the game by putting camp decorations in the atom store? The halloween event had a good mix, a lot of unlockables by only completing the mischief night event and a few in the atom shop. Some people don‚Äôt have loads of time to grind events but still want to decorate their camps for a holiday. 
---
You‚Äôre not playing but saying things are wrong. Guess you don‚Äôt see all the camps with atom store items, why would they change something to appease players like you?
---
is it? i thought i found a grape in the dome that had the Quantum power armor paint.
---
tbh the orange one is the one i'm missing.
---
My issue is with the ... at the end. Get a few rewards then it ends with ... have to hunt for what I just got.
---
I've purposely placed my camp right near Vault 76, directly below the Ol' Bessie cow (between her, the Isolated Cabin and Gilman Lumber Mill), in a small pond between , so that I can intercept and aid as many new vault dwellers as possible. I had a 100+ and 150+ husband and wife couple take me in at the lowly single digit level 7 during the E3 free event and I am now 106 with too much .38, 10mm, stimpaks and radaway (have shower), Rad-X (use diluted), and water (I only take purified water from other vendor's if I buy something from their machines, and anytime I stop by my CAMP I drop water at counter of the [Vault Dweller Bar](https://i.imgur.com/aw2vWr8.jpg) (Also really want neon lights for more WELCOM! LOL). I've helped a handful of less than level 10 players, some right out of the vault, and on top of searching for the plans I don't have and farming legendaries, helping people is one of my favorite things to do in Appalachia! I don't usually tell everyone on Reddit/in-game, other than players I know well, but I am known to just jump off in a moments notice, due to being IRL responder. (EMT/firefighter and volunteer for both as well), I guess helping new players in game is just an extension of real life combined with my love for Fallout since FO3 on Xbox 360 (and yes, Halloween FF costume is the best/most accurate for at least my departments). Even if it's not to win anything I'd love additional visitors because I am proud of my bar! (image linked above)
---
wonder why the mods removed this?!
---
Where was this posted?
---
thats a good tip, thx
---
I'm stoked for the coal since it's needed to craft Scaly Skin serums.
---
I've taken Monongah a few times and never been contested. Even had a person join for a while, share cores, and then inherit it when I logged out. I've only had one D-bag workshop theft attempt up at Red Rocket, which I did not contest but instead got out of Dodge.
---
a normal mod, yeah. one you craft and add to it. i meant a legendary mod.
---
Yep. And you know the absolute worst part, when I read free trial on the title I immediately thought they were offering a free trial of the 1st subscription to active players so we could take advantage of it for a bit. Doh! Why give the cow for free when you can rent it out on a monthly basis. If they were proper pushers they will do this some day to get you hooked after that first taste.
---
Inside the Vault update, comes along with a new event
---
And BO3.
---
I like lifegiver, also if you do lead belly and cannibal you won't need food or drink really. Fireproof is must have if you have explosive weapons, its awesome against scotchbeasts blasts too
---
Aesthetics before everything else: choose the mod which looks best. Difference in damage is not thaaat big. 
---
My baseball bat is barbedwired because looks. Never felt underpowered.
---
You are warned of what can happen before claiming it.
---
Just because you don‚Äôt like hearing it doesn‚Äôt make it any less true
---
It's buck wild when someone who no longer plays the game assumes they speak for the community about what Bethesda needs to do to keep players and bring back former players.
---
From the September 5th ITV:
---
&gt;Finally, we wanted to let you know that your feedback has not gone unheard when it comes to players who don‚Äôt help out with event objectives, or legendary enemies that get killed before you‚Äôre able to land a few hits of your own. We are working on a second phase of event improvements that will include a performance-based reward system and enable you to loot legendary enemies during events without having to hit them before they die, but this is still further down the road. We will keep you posted in the coming months and will share more details when these changes are ready.
---
I like to collect and scavenge treasure maps. I usually hoard up about 300 or so then go to collecting. I scrap all guns for mods, sell all the chems to vendors. I then generally watch the map and find a low level or two that seem to playing by themselves. I will contact that person and travel to them and dump them all my known plans for camp, weapon and armor mods.
---
Amen, amen, and AMEN!  How many times have I blown a super mutant's head off, then proceeded to run to the next one's, then ran all around looking for the loot of the previous one.  ESPECIALLY when an explosion has taken place like a car exploding.
---
There's a BFG in Fallout 4. 
---
It's pretty badass I guess but damn the ammo is expensive.
---
They are being put into a reserve for wastelanders dlc, it‚Äôs to fund the rebuild of all the new locations being populated then
---
i myself posted a datamine, and another user posted from the datamine ama
---
I feel that the receivers are not quite doing the job...i mean,as far as the receivers going,i don't think there are really many choices!You really need to be going for the most damage,so the hard receiver for me is kind of the only way to go.T
---
Wonder why they felt the need to mention that the free trial doesn't include upcoming wastelanders content??  That content would not be available at the time of the trial anyway...
---
If you have unlocked both a Santatron and a Scavenger Collectron, you'll be able to have one at a time in your C.A.M.P. 
---
But because you own them both, you can switch your Santatron to hunt for the things the Scavenger bot normally finds, or vice versa.
---
Thank you for the reply! I didn‚Äôt mean to be rude when writing this post so forgive me if I sounded that way.
---

While the Scorched thing is cool, I was hoping for an event like meat weak or mischief night.  I was hoping for a Santa Grahm.
---
From watching Youtube I thought max stats are 15.  So, what's the max?
---
I'm so excited for the Christmas event and all the new decorative items! The new string lights look so much better than last years.
---
feed the beast.
---
Well... You have three dif. Types of magazines with dif. Levels of penetration plus perks. The "armor piercing" area is too well taken care of. And Prime receivers could be considered Black Talons.
---
Revolvers could use anti-armor ammo, though.
---
Kinda makes it sound like it will be it's own game mode. Or just old content written before the delay.
---
That's super tame compared to most of the BETA guys who are well over 1500 or even more. I came in a couple days after initial release. We do what we enjoy.
---
Thanks for replying yourself! Was already getting my hopes up to be honest. Can you relay to the devs that people want more life in their camps, like ambient NPCs that wander around like the Collectrons? Thanks for the response though, it's good to clear stuff up early
---
The only keeper I had was a JFFR Gatling Plasma.  There were a couple decent rolls which were worthy of my vendor and the rest was all scrip.
---
it's also barely "pay to win" considering my camp is on a junk extractor and from what i've seen my extractor is way better than the robot. so i didn't buy it.
---
this santa one, though. i like it.
---
Ah got it thx.
---
Linky for anyone else interested: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7MJVLws9DRhH6OpzAXfLde/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-update-16-highlights
---
Just finally sold or scripted all the junk I got for 1000 scrip.
---
Those events brought people together, which caused server instability issues. I guess the true spirit of Christmas is avoiding people and killing those different than you (scorched) while playing all alone. Most scorched are not strong enough to allow for multiple people to tag them effectively so presumably everyone will spend all event jumping around scorched areas that no other players are in. Just seems like a weird set up.
---
Probably the best one we've ever had lol
---
Really is the best one we've ever had
---
Gotcha thanks for the clarification
---
\*free to those who already own the collectron - would be my guess.  
---
But who knows.
---
this and the last one were great, what with the "thank you for sticking with us, here's a few more teases for Wastelanders while we work hard to get it done".
---
tbh if they stopped doing these every week, but each one was as substantial as this, that'd be fine.
---
You tryna tell me there's *another* HOA roaming around Appalachia? Fuck all y'all, I'll cut my lawn when I damn well please (never) and paint my tent whatever color I want (green).
---
Actually Valseek replied to my post and said you can only have one at a time, but if you own both you'll be able to set the Santatron to pick up things your Collectron collects
---
Terrible.  Spent 8,000 script, and now have 4,500 script worth of weapons.
---
i'm not saying all weapons should have those!but weapons that don't have those kind of magazine options should have different kind of ammo usage
---
JuiceHead is going to HATE having to report this. If he does at all.
---
It's all good - not everyone hangs on every word that BGS publishes, so it's not unusual for there to be info out there that some people aren't aware of.  
---
I wasn't even sure I'd be able to find that issue of ITV as quickly as I did, they don't make it easy to look at back issues.
---
So for me 15 luck is a must. I normally run 3 crit savvy, 3 better crits, 3 grim reaper, 3 bloody mess, 2 starched genes the last point is up to you. Four leaf is pretty crap imo. With crit savvy you'll be filling your bar in 2 shots depending on your weapon (without any bonus in luck, so 15 luck.) I'd recommend 1 point into class freak or serendipity. I do serendipity because I'm a sneak berserker build. I'd only recommend 1 point in gunfu in agility because it's easy for vats lock to break so you just want it for the fast target to target.
---
I truly wonder what % on this sub dont play anymore or never played and only chirp to say bethesda bad based on some youtube vids.
---
 Trying to be edgy with variations of takes some dood they subscribe to yelled about only to get clicks and with little to no research before making claims.
---
Brave of you to speak your mind here. Thumbs up.
---
though now that i think about it, if they did add Incendiary as a legendary effect to the regular pool, what would happen if you had an incendiary Gatling Laser WITH the incendiary mod attatched? would it just extend the burning duration? double the burning damage?
---
So you estimate that you‚Äôve killed 3000 level 50  3* legendaries. Or 7.7 every day since release.
---
Ha no
---
Ok, thanks I haven‚Äôt seen the auto renewal option before, guess I never noticed it thanks this helped a lot
---
When you put it like that it certainly is.
---
Return of the ammo bench would be cool
---
Which one rare the alien blaster? You can get that in a safe in the toxic Valley
---
Stop watching clickbait from talentless YouTubers
---
Besides that chart copied and pasted from 12 months ago, when even Bethesda said her overall resistance was 30%, then 70%, then 50 ( in whatever order), and apparantly nobody can explain but it's so easy to just keep copying and pasting...
---
Where did I say the SCORCHBEAST QUEEN is too hard? Or did the title say SCORCHED EARTH meaning the event as a whole??
---
Hey man! I have a load of extra plans taking up space in my stash. If you‚Äôd like you can have all of what I have duplicates of
---
Okay sure, send a messages or something if you want :)
---
The Wastelanders comment is really interesting since it's only mentioned for trial players. Do you think that could mean it's closer than we thought?
---
People expect at least some decency, like people trying to PvP with someone about same power/level.
---
The game is already mess and the player base is low; why not give a hand to someone new, maybe even helping them defending the workshop vs npc if their level is too low?
---
Lol.
---
Which event gives Raider armor plans?
---
I sure hope there is more in the atomic shop than a bearded robot.
---
This holiday scorched event sounds pretty awesome.
---
I hope it will be its own game mode... really stupid to be fighting the scorged in a map where the scorged are already dealt with...
---
That‚Äôs kind of the fun of it if you ask me, trying to hunt them down before your fellow vault dwellers take them out.
---
Maybe I write it wrong I mean I look from time to time and see no changes or huge changes. I'm still active from the stand and know what I'm talking about.
---
I know many of the community wanted private lobbies and how did they implement that? Right a subscription which one can not be cancelled for the PS4, as they write down. Destroyed weapons can still be used (btw an old patched bug that came again). The Gatling weapons sometimes need several attempts to fire (problematic at events like scorched earth). Players sometimes fall under the map when joining a server or use fast travel. And there are many more bugs that I can list up. Players complained about duplicators, but Bethesda gave some 1st players tons of stuff because they didn't tested their patch and their scrapbox eat the players items. They got stuff like 600 Vault-Steel what is like playing the raid for over 180 hours or 60 hours I'm not so sure anymore.
---
And I'm afraid of Wastelanders after Patch 14.
---
Glad to see I‚Äôm not the only who does this haha
---
That's their problem. Expecting "decency" from random people in a *videogame*.
---
Secret Santa is FO ONLY
---
coal is used in a serum recipe, but outside that yeah useless
---
Looks great, it's a shame that diner sign is taking up like %15 of the camp's total budget. &gt;\_&gt; 
---
We never did get an explanation for that insanely high cost from Bethesda.
---
My last comment also fits for your comment.
---
Checkpoints would be great. They could also make it like the Burrows where if you die you start at the beginning and have to work your way back to your party. With the endless waves of enemies, it could still be a challenge to get back to your team. Then have each section have a timer and if you fail you can try it again without having to redo the sections you completed already.
---
Thank  you so much for sharing. I read your post, used the website ( [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)) and made a new build. So excited to get it going! I am only a level 26, so it is easy to respec right now.
---
Thank you for the advice on weapons. I was planning on doing lots of melee and automatic rifles AND shotguns. Took a lot of perk points. To me it makes sense to choose one weapon type and go with it. I never thought of it before you though.
---
Is there singing anywhere near as creepy as the Snowman laughs?
---
Clearly you dont spend the same amount of time that I do on my camp I'm not going through that pain in the ass again
---
If you can build the staff, you can get the drop through the purveyor just like the fixer, and get a legendary staff. It might take a while though, she is not always kind
---
Ended up with two Junkies fixers. Was happy with the first, which wasn't great 2nd and 3rd effects, but the second fixer I got was a junkies FFR. Rest were sale or right back in the scripper.
---
The whitesprings jumpsuit is pretty common after mischief night, it used to be around 10k before the event. The other 2 are still pretty uncommon, the whitepowder being more so.
---
That's not a problem, that's just a bit of naivety, followed by frustration.
---
The problem are the ones not even trying to be decent; they are unnecessary.
---
&gt;Never loot a safe that you may go back to unless it has a plan you want.
---
I don't understand what you mean. Are you saying...
---
1. Pick the lock.
---
2. See what's inside.
---
3. If there are no plans that you want, don't take anything.
---
4. Server hop and pick it again?
---
I'm just checking, because that kind of makes sense, but I never thought to do that before.
---
You have been misinformed. Auto weapons are better in vats than snipers. Especially seeing how lately crits aren't always hitting anymore (bugs or otherwise.) They also have 40% less ap consumption. I can crit more times in one mag with an auto than with a semi.
---
Good idea.
---
The day after Thanksgiving I decorated my pretend house.
---
What why? I don't want to see the game fail at all and I almost always talk about the latest stuff positive or negative. Where did you get the idea that I would hate something good happening?
---
Nice place!
---
I tried to record one of my plots yesterday and had mixed results. I used Loilo and it tends to come out a little stuttery at times cause of the microlag. 
---
How do you record your plots and what do you use? I was thinking it may be best to just record each area of the camp in photomode (which seems to slow down and smooth out movement) and then edit it later, but I've never used editing software before and wouldn't know where to start. xD
---
He was talking about plans, I didn‚Äôt read thoroughly. User error, my bad OP
---
Completely agree. My team and I have hardly done any as it seems like too much of a resource drain and stress for nothing unless you get crazy good at it.
---
Im gonna keep some and place them in camps of people i dislike lol
---
It'll be interesting to see how it pans out. Just seems odd considering how the other seasonal events were structured. The nice thing about the Halloween event was that you could run some NW matches while waiting for the top of the hour to roll around again. This doesn't work as good for balancing the 2 different events at the same time.
---
Also I really wish that double XP for NW was during the new Christmas rewards and not the old Halloween ones. Makes me regret grinding them out during the initial time.
---
A burning boxing glove would be badass. Would be really satisfying to fire punch mole rats to death.

---
Really with vats build you should always have at least 1 concentrated fire, 1 gunfu (LoS gets broken a lot not worth more than 1 point), all the crit perks in luck BUT NOT four leaf clover it sucks. So normally 2 point in starched genes and 1 point in whatever you need. Class freak, serendipity, ricochet ECT.
---
There's no Survival anymore and there's no way to PvP besides Workshops.
---
Better than when your fighting a legendary SB and it just turns away from you and floyd to the next region. Probably the most frustrating thing that happened to me lately. Luckily you can chase them down, they dont de-spawn but god its annoying.
---
well we do have some kind of ammo bench!a few additions on that would be more than welcome i think!
---
This one and the past Thanksgiving one were tremendous. This gets me really excited for the 2020 ITVs when they start dropping Wastelander details
---
I better be able to have a junk bot and santa bot active at the same time. santa bot sounds cool as hell.
---
TL;DR version: Calculating all possible combinations of items and legendary affixes only tells you how many combinations exist, not their probabilities. Weapon, ranged and armor probabilities must be calculated separately because they are in completely different trees of probability. There could be 8 million types of armor and it wouldn't affect your chances of getting a specific weapon because you are still rolling a 1 in 3 chance at the beginning when the item drops. If you fail that roll your chance is always 0%.
---
Specific 3\* armor stats are the most difficult with melee weapons being the least difficult.
---
Oh and bloody mess I forgot that.
---
You can get the Barn and Warehouse plans pretty easily through workshops and player vendors. However, the Brick and Metal variants are much rarer and will often require you purchase them from the robovendors. 
---
If you're struggling for caps, one easy way to make a tidy amount at low level is to go to the west coast and find Point Pleasant. There are Mothman Eggs there you can harvest that sell for a nice amount when cooked up. You can follow that up by heading south along the western coast and you'll come across a few farms that have a buttload of corn and razorgrain to harvest. If you get the Greenthumb perk you can get a good 300 crops from 2 minutes of picking. Between that and the Mothman food you can get about 500-600 caps for about 10 minutes of low effort.
---
Beyond that, Fort Defiance is an amazing place to farm caps when you hit around level 40 (or sooner if you have a combat build and some decent gear). The Straight Jackets that are littered around the place sell for 45 caps each with the trade perk equipped, and you get about 15 of them per clear.
---
I hope they change the way you earn NW rewards for Xmas beyond the basic XP. Would be cool to unlock at outfit for number of kills, or time stayed alive for example.
---
My mistake I should have said quest. One of the main story quests, Signal Strength, has a CHANCE to drop the plans. Other than that, you‚Äôll need to get very lucky with treasure maps.
---
It‚Äôs the same problem that Protected Casual Underarmor had. Besthesda fixed that problem by adding it to the robot vendors.
---
Sure hope soo! I wanna check your v√≠deo today. This is good news but I wish you are neutral on all your vids.
---
You can't automatically presume that it is a strait 1/3 sample on 3 star enemies killed. 
---
You also can't seriously take the Purveyer out of the equation (which I didn't). There are just too many items generated that way every day to make an assumption that everything is oh so rare. 
---
Besides, while no, I don't kill 8 3 star creatures EVERY day of my life, it is a very easy thing to do if you are intentionally farming. Without even server hopping you can get a half dozen just casually playing for a couple hours.
---
Cool try, but it does not. Even in a remote way.
---
Im sorry you feel the need to crap on this game on this sub, but at the same time remember not all ppl will not agree with your opinion and voice their own. Take it with a grain of salt.
---
Yeah my assumption is they are tiered the exact same way. I guess we will know once they drop the first one but I probably won‚Äôt start on them right away. Maybe last day of double xp. The glow in the dark suit is cool but I haven‚Äôt used it since the day I got it.
---
This is the kind of stuff that makes you want to pick the game back up if you put it down, or to keep plugging away if you never did put it down! Exciting stuff!
---
That is not what the announcement says.
---
So Double XP will be going for the Nuclear Winter Halloween Challenge re-up. Does anyone remember the amount of xp needed to get all the rewards? I didn't bother with it at all the first time around but I do really want that glowing skeleton.
---
Santatron? Santatron?! A themed robot who brings me candy?! I'm so f#*!ing excited!
---
Given how many people ask daily about "What's changed since launch?" I think it's safe to assume they aren't aware of the Wastelanders delay either.
---
Why did they mention Xbox live and PlayStation plus members are ‚Äùrequired‚Äù to access the free trial is what I‚Äôm wondering
---
Best things I got out of it were an Instigating Explosive Lever Action and an Instigating Bashing 25AP The Fixer.
---
That would be an interesting approach, maybe a bloody santa outfit unlocked only with kills and a pristine clean version for time stayed alive for the bush hiders. Lol.
---
Because if I'm handling a strong legendary solo then that means I have to wait for it to slap me back and most likely one shot me before I am able to damage it...
---
Scorched also
---
Try to make friend, many people like PvP.... or try the PvP radio.
---
... one shot killing someone like that is not PvP; where is the fun to kill a target that cant even react or fight back?
---
Keep only what you need. Simple.
---
Also being rag dolled in skyrim by giants.  Good times.
---
I only use Scrounged when I‚Äôm specifically doing scavenging runs to find stuff to sell. I equip this, Pharma Farmer, Butcher‚Äôs Bounty, the mag and bobblehead finding cards and off I go! Would never equip it just for general playing though.
---
Dont plan on making nuka shine tell i have about 100 quantums 1st then i will make shines.
---
As someone with a BSS+S boxing glove.. I would love to see that! ü•ä
---
Thx
---
Don't poo-poo the excitement. They are trying to give nice, quality, *free* things to everyone for the holidays, just like they've been doing with wallpapers.
---
Don‚Äôt know why you are getting downvoted. You are correct.
---
&gt;Besides that chart copied and pasted from 12 months ago
---
the one i posted was 7 months, after the %DR changes, the AMA even more recent at 2 months
---
&gt;Where did I say the SCORCHBEAST QUEEN is too hard? Or did the title say SCORCHED EARTH meaning the event as a whole??
---
i mean, the thread is specifically about the queen, as was the original comment. and nobody is claiming its to hard/easy
---
That would be amazing
---
I did hear something about some more "generic" NPCs will be able to stay at our camps with Wastelanders.
---
Can we get snow on the map please üòî
---
Calling it now...even with the rocky start and all the drama that's going on at this very moment...after everything is said and done FO76 will go down as one of the best games of all time
---
Yeah, well. You know how it is.
---
It's fine with me because it's a little different. It's basically another type of Legendary, and you'll bump into them in the normal course of play, rather than being summoned to a repetitive event every hour.
---
Maybe, I just reread that part. It is interesting that they say  ‚Äúwastelanders content only available for regular players during the event. So maybe they are gonna drop hints or little things for us to find like before they introduced Nuclear Winter and the sheepsquatch.
---
Interesting. I'd imagine you are no longer going full-auto when doing multiple crits then? 
---
On PS4 you need to press a different button (triangle in this case) before pressing the trigger for a critical shot to be fired. What you're describing sounds like: press crit, fire, release, re-crit, fire, release, repeat until said thing is dead.
---
Guess I'm lazy in that if I have a crit available I'll press it once and then just spray full-auto.
---
I agree there's no fun at all in PvP as it is now (apart from the now deceased mode NW). I have given many suggestions to Bethesda about how they can make PvP much more fun and less frustrating for everyone. Let's see what happens with Wastelanders.
---
Corrective vision surgery isn't too expensive these days.
---
You are the last 76 news guy I watch. You do report fairly, good and bad. Legacykilla is the joke on youtube. Such garbage he releases without even verifying most of it.
---
*Hello darkness my old friend...*
---
Yeah but I figure at most there will be one, and I want more because I'm greedy. I make little towns and I want to fill them up
---
This is what I try to do. Throw together a low level modded pipe and a bunch of .38.
---
I'm curious, did you get the dense modifier from scrapping or buying/finding them? I've never seen dense come up from scrapping yet. I do have most of the armor mods now, just missing a couple of the dense ones(metal/raider and I think robot).
---
Yeah I think I saw this camp, on PC. It was a nice camp.
---
It fill on the second shot. So it's a three round burst with the third shot being a crit every time. I have paddles so I easily spam the crit button.
---
Or the ability to turn off the timer for a higher difficulty of mobs.
---
You're really complaining about the way Bethesda chooses to give us free stuff..? You're truly a special kind of person.
---
Can't wait for the last reward to be 30 000 exp because *why the hell not* right? Let's make us grind NW during the holidays.
---
Why do you say you will always get them below level 50?
---
Really???
---
Any advice on where to find things that I can tame. My character is level 110.
---
So you know a place where I can find a deathclaw? I am level 110.
---
Plus you definitely don't need to release the trigger. Just need to practice your timing.
---
Nice! I have some practicing to do :-)
---
So if I pack up the generators instead of just logging off and leaving them, I'll still have them when I retake the workshop the next time I log in?
---
I'm fine with different, but one of the problems with the targets being only scorched is that scorched are basically never legendary on their own. The same issue was apparent during the clean up community event. Spend all day clearing scorched only to realize you haven't gotten any legendary items after hours of gameplay.
---
Personally I'm not muh into PvP, but I also sent them officially a suggestion (some kind of 5x5 flag capture). It will be promptly ignored, but at least I tried :D
---
"Ends in a week"
---
Exactly. 
---
I don't bother to server hop but there are members here who run a level 3 safe route and server hop. Level 2 and 3 safes are the best.
---
Good luck. You can deal great damage even without a bloodied weapon when you get it right.
---
Luck also affects how fast your critical hit bar fills (I could be wrong though)
---
Pretty sure it's primary objective is to play it online with several other players.
---
Depending on the time maybe we can go hunting for some of those new festive scorched together too üëç if your not too involved in the quest line or anything
---
Firstly, I appreciate you replying and respect the inquiry. 
---
Perhaps my off the cuff remark was a bit tongue in cheek, but regardless, as a long time subscriber I can say that it is my sincere opinion that your coverage of this game, over the past year, though thorough and dependable, also seems to carry a rather, for lack of a better term, ‚Äúbias‚Äù against the game, and your informational videos regarding FO76 news have become significantly more subjective in the way it‚Äôs presented versus objective. 
---
Case in point, the grossly exaggerated and over reported ‚Äúcivil war‚Äù between FO1st and non FO1st members was pretty much invented by sensationalist Youtubers happy to report on controversy (I am not necessarily including you in this, but at least initially, it seemed like you were adding to the ‚Äúyellow journalism‚Äù that was being propagated by other more ‚Äúsensationalistic‚Äù youtubers. 
---
Though I am still a sub of yours, in the interest of full disclosure, I more eagerly anticipate InnovSurvivalist‚Äôs post on the subject, as I feel that she covers the game not with a halo of negativity, but with a genuine like of the game and taking opinion out of the equation, she also conveys a more objective view on certain things than I admittedly pickup from your videos. 
---
I apologize for my long response. Brevity has never been my strong suit.
---
I would say it will be around the same as the skeleton outfit, if done rigth it is doable
---
Also those water filter things no one ever uses, I think? So still mostly useless.
---
I don't understand what this is about.
---
The collectron skins that‚Äôve been leaked were all separate purchases anyway, not just skins. That and the fact that this one collects different items makes it clear that it‚Äôll be it‚Äôs own item for free that doesn‚Äôt have any prerequisite purchases
---
Thanks, I've been working on a Junkies build (Commando using JE Handmade) so the potential is certainly there
---
The season definitely makes me wonder how the Savage Divide would look if it were snowcapped.
---
This type of event was probably the easiest to implement without having to divert resources from the development of Wastelanders. If something more substantial was planned before, that would have been designed for the version of the game that already has living NPCs and all the associated tech upgrades, so the scorched hunt event is something that had to be made quickly after the delay, and with limited manpower.
---
I sell the weapons I can hold. But fast traveling hurts my wallet and I don't have spare points for that perk that makes it cheaper. I've been hovering just over 1000 caps lately. 
---
I don't know what PA is, sorry. I'm still new. But I do not use a laser Gatling.
---
Probably
---
I have no idea if it's correct. Probably not. I'm going to try anyway. I wanted another character to 50 anyway for the purveyor deal weeks. I do have an extra the fixer plan though. I will see when i get there.
---
 Its getting quite boring anyway on my level 270 character.  I already have a bunch of God tier weapons and armor. A change of scenery is nice.
---
Bethesda is the only company in the world to be late on holiday season.
---
PSSSSssssssst, Bethesda, it's fucking okay to be christian and celebrate christmas, if you are not, do them all you fucking twats...
---
Yeah I found that curious too. I doubt Wastelanders could be coming that soon but you never know
---
Let's actually take your theory as a good idea for a moment to imagine what the game would actually be like. First, if you want it to be an in game drop then you have to choose what % chance it has to drop. If it's common then there will be a bunch of santatron plans floating around on characters like pumpkins from the Halloween event. This also opens the doors to people having to pay caps in order to unlock it which is no fun. If it were a reward for a seasonal quest then they'd have to make the quest and develop everything around it. Taking away resources from Wastelanders development. This is simply easiest for everyone.
---
Dude I see you as most unbiased of any of the Youtubers covering this game. You report on the good, the bad, and the grey areas. 
---
If one leans heavily one way or the other regarding this game that may color their impression of your news reporting. Don‚Äôt sweat it man.
---
A couple of weeks ago I posted something on here, saying that I will be doing a secret Santa. All you had to do was tell me what you wanted and I will make it happen. However, people kept ordering things and when I went to deliver it no one would respond
---
Probably hecause of gameplay issues or something like that
---
Same reason why there aren't any melee executions or special death animations for getting killed by specific enemies (like the Assaultron or the Yao Guai)
---
Yes,  mischief night event was actually good to be honest I played it sometimes. The Atomic Shop wasn't bloated with microtransactions. I think you're right and you've made a good point as well. But a negative aspect of patch 14 (the Halloween Update) was the monthly subscription for a private server (and other stuff). Like I said in an other comment the community suggested private servers and we got them in form of an monthly subscription of 12$. The Community wanted a fridge but I think most of the players didn't wanted it like an atom shop item. I just want to say that. 
---
Edit after I got a message of Patch 16:
---
I have readed the patch notes for patch 16 and so far it looks like they are doing the same thing as Halloween, what is the right way. But I m still afraid worried about Wastelanders and I really hope I am wrong.
---
Where did you see new string lights? 'Cause actual Christmas lights would be awesome.
---
It's one of the cap sinks required to prevent runaway inflation in the game.  Same with fast travel fees, NPC vendors, etc.  The game spontaneously mints caps for rewards, mob loot, cap stashes and so on.  They need cap sinks to remove that money supply.  Unfortunately, that's the same general argument for the 30k caps limit- trying to limit available liquid caps floating around.
---
It's all a rough attempt to keep the overall caps supply more or less even, or at least not too far out of control.  Otherwise, player-to-player vendors tend to get more expensive as cap values drop (player vendors charging what the market will bear, while the market has more caps to easily spend), in-game vendor transactions (like plans and equipment) get too easy/cheap (making that aspect of the game too easy), and generally screws things up in a lot of unanticipated ways.  I don't know if B. has one, but many MMOs actually employ economists to keep an eye on such things.  There have been some pretty interesting articles, and even a few doctoral theses and books, on economy in game worlds.  Kind of a neat thing to watch over time.
---
Yeah, it's doable, and the map rotation should spice things up but imo the 15k was just a little bit too much. 10k would have been more than ehough. For instance, I found the VTU rewards to be more accessible and less time consuming and the last reward didn't even ask for that much. Moreso you could unlock all of them one at the time on the first day, whereas drip-feeding the release of rewards is a waste. We all know most people will just wait until all rewards are released to unlock EXP for all of them at once.
---
I'm not into PVP, I don't find FO76's controls fun in a competitive environment... So I spent most of my grind hiding in bushes.
---
I have a level 50 Perfect Storm I found at a vendor back in the day...I don't use it but something I'll keep forever...
---
https://gamestoday.info/pc/fallout/new-map-of-random-encounter-locations-found-by-datamining-and-made-with-mappalachia/
---
You want to use the Scene map. ive had good luck in lower mire and bog
---
I would match players who have similar pvp kill counts over the last 24 hours they have spent in the game. This would isolate griefers to their own server, and leave everyone else alone.
---
I wonder if these holiday scorched only spawn at regular scorched locations or if you can just find them anywhere. It‚Äôd make farming them easier if it‚Äôs the former
---
Just like me ahaha 50 matchs in top 10 without armor ou weapons at all... Just let them kill themselves
---
haha I forgot about those
---
I use mine just to tag it. I then let other players kill it.
---
At least the Double XP will make it *far* easier to do
---
QFFR railway gun and BFFR plasma gun.
---
Both have 250 DR while reloading though ü§¢
---
holiday infected? -- that's downright merry!
---
The datamine from last weeks patch showed some new styles! 
---
They new holiday stuff starts popping up around 7 minutes in.

Your teammates can stim you but if you bleed out it kicks you out and you can go back in.
---
As long as they aren't firing their pea shooters at her, preventing her from landing, it shouldn't matter. If anything they'll distract a few of the trash mobs that spawn while you and the other high levels can do the actual damage. What irks me is high levels that AFK.
---
yea i would farm there but as atm im a melee character exclusively id rather just not deal with being shot at
---
Checkpoints for Raids
---
I assume you mean Shielded? Because I don't think I've ever seen that one for Casual. Is that the only one missing? I don't think I've ever seen Treated Raider, either.
---
They really shouldn't make them less difficult, what they really need to do is make success more rewarding so people want to do it.
---
An eyebot that goes around and plays music for you :000
---
Yes. Yesss. Yesssssssss
---
The plans and bulk ammo scrap are great rewards in my opinion. They‚Äôre too hard to obtain. So yeah I don‚Äôt agree.
---
I disagree.  Learning expert missions in V94 was the only challenging content in the game. 
---
There's plenty of casual content in the game already. 
---
That said I can say that standard is very casual once you know what to do and expert isnt *that* hard.
---
I think they pointed it out just in case not everyone is up to date with the news, and some of the people who are still unaware that Wastelanders has been delayed might have ended up very disappointed downloading the trial and finding out that it is still the "old" game.
---
Okay thank you. BTW my phone doesn't like that website for some reason. It warns me about viruses but I manage to Google it the map.
---
I personally watch Juicehead, albeit with a grain of salt. I get that like a lot of us, that he still enjoys the game. Like any good individual, he is critical of what has spanned over the course of time, and I can respect that.   
---
Granted, I still hear him say a lot of the same stuff over and over again in his videos, but that's because he expects better. It's why I still watch his videos.  
---
As for LegacyKillaHD, I've legitimately blocked his channel on Youtube. If anything, I detest more vitriol and hate on a game I've personally been hooked on since the announcement.
---
Good Argument I agree but I think it is also not fun to pay hard-cash for something like this. Sorry for the short and late answer but it is really hard to reply detailed to everybody. 
---
To add: After I read the Patch 16, I think they do it the right way. Doing such festival events like the Halloween scheme was the way as the community wanted it (not like the main feature of this patch (Private Worlds)).
---
Also great that you argued instead of replying useless stuff like "what can a non active player say about it"
---
I just changed my sub to annual.  I am now totally hooked on the private server aspect.  It adds a lot of what previous FO's had.  The other thing that's great is that all enemies spawn at appropriate levels.  Not all level 60 at top of the world or whatever just because that's who was just there.
---
It has made the playthru for my new character a lot more fun and less frustrating.
---
Oh I remember you haha. We won‚Äôt agree üòÖ
---
Awesome! Thanks for the link!
---
I think these things can be funny at times. I got hit by a Gulper and caught fire yesterday . I killed them and stayed on fire for my entire time on the server. I got some great photos of my character on fire with the Mothman and in several locations around the map. Even when I put on PA it was on fire it looked cool.
---
I am not the OP but some of us remember the early days. I don't watch your videos because I remember that you were on the hate train early on.
---
Pretty sure it counts both places
---
I assumed the double experience happened during the free trial, thus ending on December 16th. The NW event begins on the 17th:
---
&gt; In addition to the Free Trial Weekend, we‚Äôre also kicking off a new Double XP event for all game modes during those same dates
---
So, they actually count as part of your build total AND your stash weight I believe.
---
The liberators collect them and use them to buy canned goods at Mama Dolce's as part of their plan to turn West Virginia into a communist state.
---
I got the whole deal after I completed The Messenger once.
---
I think what Valseek was meaning, was that you can still have only one of them out at a time. They're essentially both Collectrons, just gathering from a different loot table.
---
Exploding wouldn't be op on a 10mm smg even with the burning damage.
---
Holy crap.
---
Hey thanks for taking the time to reply, I actually really appreciate getting feedback on my stuff. 
---
I recognize your point on the civil war thing, but I feel like I kind of mentioned that? I covered it mostly because it was a big topic at the time and a lot of people wanted to hear my thoughts on it. Iirc I mentioned how somebody reported a case of it occurring, but that I had never seen it and in fact seen the opposite (cut to everyone dancing together). I don't think I painted it as this massive problem around the game as much as said yea that is a thing that may have happened a couple time, but I haven't seen it. I understand how even covering it at all may be viewed as ridiculous, but sometimes I cover things because they are big. If the civil war thing was one random post and got no attention I would never mention it, but since it had become such a thing and all these crazy stories were being spread around it I felt the need to give my take from a more realistic perspective (at least I think that is what it was). I have done this in the past with other things that imo weren't noteworthy, but micovered or blown out of proportion so I feel a need to talk about it. Like the moldy helmet thing - I saw the article and had no intention of covering it, but then saw a bunch of people talking about how it was effecting PA edition helmets and felt a newfound need to "set the record straight" in a way. 
---
I would agree that I am biased, but I think literally all YouTubers are biased one way or another. I try to format my videos in a way that counteracts this (facts first, opinions after) but of course it will come through. Case in point with Innov you describe how you like her content because of her more positive bias. That is not to say it is a bad thing at all, but a different perspective (I enjoy her stuff too). 
---
But one thing I don't fully get is your point on me hating to report on this. I think I pretty much talk about everything notable good or bad. As of late imo there has been a lot more bad, but its not like I didn't talk about the inclusion of V79, recent Wastelanders teases, or later today when I praise Bethesda for a swift gift removal from cheaters. Is there something notable that you feel like I haven't covered around Fallout 76 due to my bias? Or is it more that you feel I cover more minor negative aspects of the game due to my bias and not more minor positive aspects?
---
Yeah I made that comment before Valseek added that comment. See I was already getting ahead of myself lol
---
Yeah, made it to the top 10 way more often that way than actually playing the mode. It somehow made it more exciting for me, a really dangerous hide'n'seek ahah
---
But I don't know if I could handle 25 more games of that during Christmas. It was really time-consuming.
---
Are you on xbox?
---
Ability to build villages with friends
---
Heck, even some of the datamining and images of Wastelanders is looking amazing!
---
I‚Äôll definitely do this, thanks for the help!
---
It‚Äôs annoying, but I think it happens because you‚Äôre technically replacing the entire wall on the inside, rather than just retexturing it. That‚Äôs how it seems to be anyway
---
I love your reddit name.
---
Not exactly sure what you‚Äôre trying to say to be honest. Now you bring up private servers? That has nothing to do with the atom store. On that subject though, so how do you think they are able to maintain the servers for you to play privately? It costs money to keep them running. I don‚Äôt know of any game that gives you a private server for free. Wandering around playing 76 majority of the players don‚Äôt seem to have a problem paying for 1st either. I see scrap boxes everywhere, survival tents scattered at scorched earth, and the dancing emotes all the time. If anything the best value is the atoms you get with it, not the private server. I hardly see anyone on a private server in my friends list. 
---
The fridge? I didn‚Äôt see anyone asking for that. You have a backpack mod that does the same thing that you can utilize perk cards with to reduce the weight instead of stashing it at full weight. Who goes through that much food that you fill all 15 slots anyway. The fridge is more a cosmetic item with a almost useless perk to stash food. Adding that was in no way game breaking either. 
---
No matter what gets added there will always be people finding something to hate on. There is no perfect world to please everyone and keep the game evolving for years to come.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been trying this but haven‚Äôt had any luck with high level players. Even though i try to be peaceful they just annihilate me lmao. But thanks for the tips
---
This does help, BTW. When you have multiple workshops and the "defend" event starts at a couple at once - you just can't be there in both places. So, if someone defs them for you - it's great help.
---
+30% dmg vs animals
---
Shielded (or whatever the top tier is I can‚Äôt remember) has a chance to drop from Queen of the Hunt. The issue was that it wouldn‚Äôt drop unless you had the lower tier one that was a possible reward from the main quest line. Oh and queen of the hunt was bugged forever so a lot of players (myself included) never had the quest pop up. 
---
Treated Raider is just a normal drop I believe. I know that the shielded raider plan is highly sought after (still haven‚Äôt gotten it myself lol) and can be rewarded in Savage Divide events
---
Junkies/explosive/faster reload Fixer was my major haul. Got another Quad Tesla too, but I think the secondary effect was underwhelming. I was fairly satisfied with what I got.

100-200lbs of shared stash space between characters on the same profile.

Legacy has several videos of horribly exaggerated stuff or just flat out lies. I dont get why people still watch him.

You should. Same workshop only and I think its a week. I packed up some turrets last night so I will test again later on today.
---
If you have an NVIDIA graphics card, simply press Alt+F9 to instantly start recording.

I've liked your videos for years and still watch them JuiceHead, but I agree with this guy. You are entitled to your opinion but I've noticed, especially when talking about microtransactions, you seem to be biased against 76. One example is you've said that the prices are outrageous when being compared to other games but really the prices are quite average. I mean, you cover creation club content all the time and the prices are much more outrageous than 76. Especially the fact that all that DLC costs money where Fallout 76 is making it all free. I don't think I've ever heard you talk about how easy it is to earn atoms for free either. 
---
One of the titles for your videos was literally "Bethesda Just Added a $7 Fridge Into Fallout 76". Sure it costs 700 atoms but I would argue that $7 is not the actual cost of the fridge. You mentioned learning about economics in college yet refuse to take into account that Fallout 76 is handing out over 700 atoms a week for free. Surely you must know that this devalues the currency (atoms) right? I've bought everything I wanted from the atom shop without paying a dime. I understand risque titles bring in more views but that's exactly the point PRL867 is making about your bias towards the game relative to other 76 Youtubers.
---
Also, it seems like you've been level 20-30 in nuclear winter for the last year. I'm starting to get the feeling that you don't really play which ties in to why PRL867 and I probably enjoy InnovSurivalist and RifleGaming videos as of recent.

Never happened to me,  I regularly take 2-3 workshops for free fasttravel. The only time I got in trouble was claiming someone else's workshop - turrets started shooting me at some point in time. Once a guy tried capturing my workshop - shot me badly, I ran away. But  then I returned and seems my turrets started shooting him - so he has teleported out.
---
If you don't lock resources - why should they capture your workshop if they can have all for free? Except when there's daily task to capture workshop.
---
Seems this is a "community" issue - just like with Rust. Tried playing (family sharing), got happy cause I didn't buy it to my account :)
---
then maybe those low levels shouldnt be doing a fight they dont know either, and ruining for the ones that do. 
---
Every single Queen fight I have done in the last 3 months we had to have someone go to public chat and chew out the newbies for not performing the event properly. 
---
If it was your nuke, do what  you want.  But when its my nuke, fight her the way I want you to.  You will get loot, it will take 5 minutes, and then you can go fuck up someone elses day.
---
The last ban wave a few weeks ago hit people using cheat engine to modify files. After that went out I saw a marked decrease in NW wall shooting flying insta killing players. I hope that with this free weekend they keep whatever they used up to date!
---
the guns from fallout 3 and NV and right-handed bolt action animation
---
What, the melee executions? Yeah, they were
---
[Here's a vid showcasing them](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dJGhg484bbE)
---
I would like it to be a central casino location where you buy chips with caps and then you can exchange the chips for caps or even script (at a much higher exchange rate). The casino can have slots, blackjack, poker, roulette and the like. Maybe a poker table that can be crafted at your camp to play poker out in the wasteland.
---
Unyielding and Assassin's are both Prefixes
---
So like New Vegas
---
Your Unstoppable Monster or Bloodied Meat hook isnt going to do shit if some lvl 15 with a pipe pistol wont stop shooting her.
---
Or some dumbass tosses a grenade as soon as she lands (which causes her to take off again)
---
If you sit by the overseer camp and the covered bridge he will eventaully wander through.
---
Don't carry 8 heavy weapons and its ammo. You have a stashbox that's accessable from many places
---
Exactly. Except for your luck skill has no effect in the casino.
---
Yep, that's it's only use, never in a battle though.
---
huh, I never played as a melee character so I never got to see these
---
Does this include stimpacks
---
combine fusion cores or ultracite fusion cores so I don't have 20+ with 4%
---
by shooting her in the air, or tossing grenades which prevent her from landing.
---
or standing on V9, the fenced in area isnt big enough for her to land, so she stays in the air.
---
This is correct.  It's a bit of a limitation with the game engine.  The game is both storing and displaying/rendering the items, so both have to be accounted for.
---
It was talked about quite a bit when they first came out.
---
Camp budget improvements :(((
---
[And here's the vid for the special death animations](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RujD8C1p3uM)
---
Yeah combined they weigh less than a handmade with Bear Arms, so your point is moot.
---
They might ban a few obvious cheaters, but I would not expect a major overhaul to anti-cheat or general security before the big updates announced for next year. I hope those will finally bring some improvements to the net code, servers, lag, optimization, and make the game less easily exploitable.
---
thats why im a free states girl. fuck HOA rules.
---
Logistic / fine print reasons. You can‚Äôt play multiplayer games without love or plus. One idiot will be like ‚ÄúI downloaded it but can‚Äôt play it for free!?!?!‚Äù. But if you‚Äôre on pc you just need an internet connection.
---
I'm sure there will be, I can't wait for that Santatron and I'm excited for whatever else is coming
---
Junkies is pretty good. I'm going berserker so I can use the weapons no one wants.
---
You get a set by finishing the hornwright quests. Don't remember the name offhand but it doubles the yield when mining ore while wearing it
---
I'm pretty sure we're getting companions who chill in our camp with Wastelanders. It probably will have a limit of 1-- at least to start-- but it's something. xD
---
so you're saying small things like this need optimisation...
---
A doggo that wanders around my camp like my collectron
---
Good idea with the chat thanks. Just wished that worked a little better too...
---
The most powerful build is the Duper build. Anything that‚Äôs the latest meta, this build has it. If you‚Äôre not using any duped BS, your build is just 2nd best at best üëå
---
I'm not seeing the quoted text you're referencing. I see " The trial will not include upcoming Wastelanders content," which doesn't mean people who have bought the game **are** getting Wastelanders content.
---
Not arguing the point, but can you point me to the full paragraph (I'm old so entirely possible my eyes are just missing it).
---
Funny you should mention berserker, I've been slowly collecting a small cache of explosive berserker weapons for my next build after Junkies ;-)
---
Thank you everyone for the replies. With fireproof 3 and a dense heavy leather set I can take 4 shots from a person at half health with a bloodied explosive laser which is much better than without the dense mod. And I‚Äôm glad to know about stealth boys being iffy
---
Put 1 point for each gladiator perk and iron fist for a 40% buff with 4 points, rather then fully ranked up cards. If it was me Id do the steath commando as backup cause you can do solid dmg with just a bloody mess buff and nerd rage if you got a bloodied rifle. Meat hooks obviously better for bosses, couple 5.56 rounds per mutant at westek for xp, loot or whatever you go to places like wes tek for cause thats all it takes. You feel me?
---
Edit: just seen the link now, still got my opinion.
---
I haven't attempted a raid but I would have to agree with you. Most players are used to the more chilled relaxed Fallout exploring. With the difficulty of enemies in the raid as is and the server troubles most players have, the timer doesn't work. It literally sets you up to fail.
---
Jesus, what is your build that you get to 711 damage on it?
---
I didn't even realize you could get these legendary
---
.....except for an entire mode dedicated to PVP, hunter/hunted, and icons where you can flag yourself. There really isn't ANY lack of opportunity for PVP. There IS a lack of ways to FORCE PVP on people who didn't sign up for it.
---
I would use critical savvy or grim reaper's sprint, and also swap out pharma farma (it can still be equipped when needed). Although it looks like you would prefer not to use VATS? But if you do want to use it, then I recommend higher perception and luck, and lower endurance and intelligence (ironclad is not essential, nor is having gunsmith equipped all the time), then adding concentrated fire and luck perks that improve criticals.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7MJVLws9DRhH6OpzAXfLde/fallout-76-aus-dem-vault-highlights-von-update-16
---
Did you have beam splitter and burning on the laser?
---
Lack of that statement in all ad copy (and photoshopped out of box pictures) when I bought the game almost made me return it.  (What?!?! Another 60$?!?! )
---
The reason I didnt return it was by the time the package was delivered to my house, xmas sales were in progress, and I could not return it for the price I paid.  
---
So I bit the bullet and bought PS+.  Hindsight says glad I did.  But I would have rather had the notification PS+ was required beforehand, not after the fact.
---
Yeah I guess, it‚Äôs just that bloodied isn‚Äôt the best for pvp and I want a solid pvp/pve
---
I see you
---
I‚Äôm a bloodied build, I mainly use my bloodied meat hook.
---
I keep gunsmith because my auto tse handmade wears really fast, I‚Äôm trying to get my hands on other guns so I have back ups
---
600 some scrip and the best I got was a bloodied explosive pipe revolver.
---
The point was to seamlessly switch to melee when running out of ammo
---
Thanks for the correction! I did that quest 112 levels ago (which means months of game time for me), so I had forgotten that.
---
That'd be awesome :D How do I find you, and that sweet sweet loot? ;)
---
Great build! I love camps like this that blend in with the surroundings and have a theme to them.
---
what is itv?
---
I will give you my first born for this
---
OMG. That would make a beautiful present for my girlfriend. You lucky person!
---
I suspect more NPCs will be a feature of mods/private servers, rather than the base game. I doubt the servers could handle every single player having a bunch of NPCs in their camp. xD
---
That. Why would it include Wastelanders content either way? We won't have it then so why mention it?
---
Inside The Vault, the weekly update article released by Bethesda!
---
I'm really not...this is how I truly feel...i believe they didn't have a direction when the game first released...slowly but surely they are building something that has the potential to be great...hope they don't Eff it up like Rockstar did GTAO....time will tell but on console there's no other game like it to me
---
yeah i know what you're saying 
---
i play on ps4 and i just see how bad performance can be, not all the time, but it needs to improve a lot...
---
i play tons of games on my ps4, but fo76 reminds me of playing skyrim on ps3... pretty sure they could do a lot to improve performance, cuz other games i play like rdr2, BFV, MW, spiderman etc none of those games' performance is as bad as fo76 even though graphics are a lot better 
---
but i still enjoy the game tho
---
At higher levels, as you collect more perk cards, you can swap in weapon artisan 3 to repair guns to double condition. That is, assuming you do not already have it. In general, the late game involves a lot of perk swapping, which can get annoying. Similarly, you do not need hard bargain in combat, lone wanderer (if you play solo) and maybe rank 1 of tenderizer could be more useful, then switch to hard bargain when trading with vendor bots.
---
Considering Fo76 is absolutely trash, what i'm basically seeing is people desperately trying to think buying this ""game"" was worth it. You can't even say they're defending it because they have nothing to defend.
---
What 2nd and 3rd trait for the meathook? Unyielding armor? What 2nd and 3rd trait on Unyielding? Marine, Scout or Heavy BoS?
---
Hey there,This is how I would build a commando/meathook build:

---
Swap out perks:Nerd Rage if you are a Bloodied build-&gt;First Aid if you aren'tSwap Better Criticals for Pharma Farma or Scrounger depending on what sort of collection run you are doing.
---
You can get Calibrated Shocks for both legs of the X-01 that will add 100 pounds of carry weight to your power armor. Personally, I just wish they had legendary power armor pieces like with regular armor that had some of the same types of perks.
---
Yeah I decided to switch it hard bargain for tenderizer and I‚Äôll just switch it when I‚Äôm selling stuff
---
I didn‚Äôt see what he wrote. What would you recommend?
---
I would hope they roam the entire map.  In a way, I like the idea better than being pretty much locked in to one location for a week grinding to get all the rewards.  
---
  Surely better for lower levels, who, in general, were woefully underprepared/underequipped for the location of Mischief night.
---
"It's important that we.."
---
WE dont have to do shit. Do as you please but fuck this WE shit.
---
Stay salty my guy
---
Fair enough...
---
You couldn't be more wrong about bloodied builds: most of those get facerolled in the missions due to massive hordes of ghouls and other melee enemies handing out rads like candy and/or rads within the Vault itself mandating the use of rad sponge or radaway.
---
Full health fares VASTLY better in Vault 94 to the point where I have a few friends who don't run it simply because their bloodied builds DON'T work in there and they refuse to change it up.
---
At most going in at around 60% health on a bloodied build works but at that point you could be using junkies, furious, aa, ts, or other legendary effects and getting pretty comparable results.
---
As for the lag though sadly this is still a factor.  You can occasionally find a "good" server that allows you to run expert missions but it often takes multiple server hops.  Private servers are really the best option now to run the missions.
---
So yeah, lag is enemy #1 here and needs to get resolved before more timed content should be added to the game.
---
The most powerful hits come from very weak builds, Bloodied ones. So you might find less power and more survivability to be an actually stronger build.
---
 I can melt the horde at The Golf Club with my Combat Knife build and suffer a reasonable amount of damage and walk away with everything. A Bloodied build would kill the first one with one shot, but then be mobbed to death.
---
In most vendors 1:1, I sometimes see it in outside game with a slight bulk discount, but not a lot.
---
If ESO is anything to go by (it costs 700 crowns there), chances are you might have to if such option was added.
---
Alright, I'm pretty happy with this. An event for getting goodies from going out and fighting scorched, a free santa-themed robot, and double xp? That's really nice. Also going to be good to see what fixes come with Update 16 too. Good way to run out the last of the year I think. Though I do wonder if Santatron will be able to collect junk too as an option, or if you need to have the junk collector bot to do that?
---
 The best experience like this I have had was the dragon thing in the original Metro. If you are slow at the library, he will grab you and pick you way up in the sky and just throw you.
---
 Still my best death in a video game so far. ;)
---
Yea mate I have the worst rng but I guess that day it was on my side. Lol I hope you get one for your gf
---
Lol üòÇ
---
1 cap. Some people buy for 2 but the people who sell for 2 are stupid.
---
Well what I'm wondering is I see people using as a trade currency so is it still 1:1 then or dose its value increase when using it as currency
---
So a regular combat rifle has a higher dps than a handmade?
---
Yea any of the sheepsquash weapons can drop at the purveyor as a legendary
---
No, fixer does tho.
---
GT: Justinjr2488 I‚Äôll be on in an hour or so I can join you :)
---
This is really cool to see! The rest of the article was interesting to read also, however, I will be going away on the 12th until the 30th and it seems I will miss out on everything. Can has plenty of F's in chat, please?
---
Yes, it was modded properly.
---
Holy Krampus. That's one heck of a weapon. And 711 damage with that? Absolutely horrifying. I should look into making a melee build sometime, I always seem to end up making heavy weapon power armor builds.
---
F but if you're on PS4 or Xbox you can play remotely via apps but still F
---
this - suppressor and other barrel attachments plus sight options would make this gun a lot more viable.
---
I'm talking specifically about attachments that keep the gun from wobbling side to side at all and not climbing too fast in ADS.  Unsure if there's a direct correlation to what the attachments are designed to do.  Captainnoob mentioned it in one of his vids but can't remember which.
---
What is this voodoo nonsense you speak of
---
Mumbles didn't provide me with much.  Maybe a couple mildly interesting items for my vendor :(
---
It‚Äôs good you are still covering the game. 
---
Sometimes I feel the thumbnails are too hate-clickbaity, but that comes with the platform I guess.
---
Only thing I do make sure is avoid the comment section. I don‚Äôt know why but it‚Äôs 99% haters most of the time with the videos. Usually always the trolls and toxic ones. Like the ones that have that mockery annoying tone. 
---
Personally I like that you are sticking by the game and keeping it to facts and logic first and keeping it real and I know you still play. 
---
Your videos are at least better than other YouTubers I can name that does this just for hate revenue. 
---
I am looking forward Wastelanders news you have.
---
What's your best heavy weapon power armor build
---
Last night SB fights.... tripleteamed by 2 regulars + 1 legendary.  Found the regular bodies, but the legendary poofed to who knows where.  Argh.
---
I say do it! It‚Äôs really fun!
---
You're gunna pay anywhere from 30k to 45k for the full set, usually 15k for body, 20k for head.
---
My guess is that they have a chance to appear, like a legendary enemy, and they‚Äôll be found in normal scorched locations.  Berkeley Springs, Morgantown Airport, etc.
---
Remote play on PS4 and someone mentioned you can do the same for Xbox
---
Guess I'm setting down Modern Warfare and GTA for a few games. This seems promising to me.
---
Be careful with explosive on berserker. Hurts really bad üòÇ. 
---
A little tip for berserker. Get gear with sentinel and stuff with damage reduction for certain types of mobs. When gear breaks you get the legendary effect still with none of the DR that effects your weapon damage negatively.
---
"We pulled the Haloween event 8 hours early so we're restoring progress and giving you 5 days to complete it. Fuck everyone who actually spent the time prioritizing it." 
---
What a fucking joke.
---
How though? on a phone? I have never heard of this.
---
Are you ok?
---
Yeah phone. Look up remote play PS4, I've used it before
---
* once you know the plan for them.
---
They cower in fear that you eat them for breakfast :)
---
I just bought the body and I am only 40 tokens from getting the head , I would not sell the set for less than 55 to 60 k . Alot of time to collect all those tokens
---
Make a ticket. Characters might be recoverable.
---
That a is a hybrid stock. Half true and half bashing.
---
Forceful is another. Half stabilized and half bashing.
---
Bashing gives you a lot of condition so ppl like it.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been waiting for carpet lol
---
 In the FWIW category -  Couple of patches back, they changed they weight of items in display cases/stands from (whatever the item weighed in stash) to something negligible .... like 0.01.
---
The T-giving display cases seem to take less budget than the glass cases, and can hold more, so you don't need as many of them to display the same amount of stuff.
---
Great tip! armor level shouldn't matter either since it'll be broken, so probably a bit easier/cheaper to get.
---
The ‚Äúlegendary Santa‚Äù concept is pretty cool.  It would be funny if they came with a raspy, labored ‚Äúho ho ho‚Äù voice line.
---
I‚Äôm honestly happy that the plasma grenade plan will probably become fairly common, but I feel a little bad for players that struggled to acquire it.
---
That's really great! I love everything about!
---
Exactly
---
They very well could be.
---
Those who attack Workshop Owners are most often Wanna-Bees attacking low level players to make themselves feel big &amp; tough, we frequently use workshops to help level up new characters, and also bait in the griefers and murder them, as soon as they realize there are other high level players to deal with, 90% bug out. I will occasionally contest a workshop, just for the PvP, but only with high level (100+) players, and evenly matched teams, PvP can be fun, but I see no point in ganging up on someone, or murdering low level unsuspecting players, there's no sport in that.
---
Actually, a normal crafted bear arm shows 700-800 i dmg on my character, it's really nice, but the one he got is has the anti armor and swing speed, so it should be very good :)
---
not one of each but santa tron can collect both from what they are saying...and it seems like it will be free...dare i say.
---
next week bud
---
Yea I wish it would have been a bloodied but at the same time I‚Äôm happy it didn‚Äôt drop as a nocturnal bear arm lol
---
Anybody get that weird thing where the yaoguai can kill you in for hits because they do a 1/4 of your health and hit incredibly fast?
---
They removed survival mode, so yeah workshops are a lot more contested now as they tend to be the best way to signal to the rest of the players on the server that you are down for pvp.  
---
My advice is there are other sources to get those same resources if you don't want to pvp, just don't take the workshop.  Or do as others suggest - take it but don't hang out there for hours on end expecting to just be able to gather up resources without any conflict.  instead setup the minimum needed to get the resources you want, leave, and then return later to collect.  This way your not exposed for a long time.
---
I think someone lied
---
The vertibirds.  If you repair the landing pads in thew workshop, you'll get automated vertibirds that circle around the workshop and fire on enemies.  There will also be a crate of signal grenades you can grab.  As long as you're not out of range, you can be running around the world--such as AVR medical Center for example--toss a signal grenade and the vertibots will fly to your location to provide some extra firepower and backup.
---
What an elitist crappy world someone must live in to begrudge other people a chance to earn make believe items.
---
Most of the people I see at workshops actually want to pvp these days.  But in any event calling people dumbasses for pvping in a pvp area isn't constructive.
---
99% of the map and game is pve only and pacifist mode is a thing, imo let the pvpers have their tiny slice of the pie.
---
what about griefers who don't PvP?
---
Or just players who don't play well in a group (i.e. one-shotting legendaries)
---
Two handed is nice
---
Yeah, this is annoying as Hell.
---
There's Hunted/Hunter on the radio...
---
Indeed. All my legendary gear now starts with "aaa". Saves a lot of time swapping sets
---
Oh. THOSE vertibirds. They do hardly any damage though, never really seemed worth the hassle of taking a workshop for them.
---
I believe better criticals (and other critical boosting multipliers) is only calculated from your base critical damage, so it won‚Äôt include things like sneak attacks, eagle eyes, mister sandman, etc.
---
The numbers can get a bit wonky but I believe it still works as intended.
---
Legendary Super Mutants used to do it a lot as well. They used to shout, "Run Away." and I always started looking for a legendary. Maybe Todd is trying to keep those good drops away from us lol.
---
An AMR and actual clans/faction interaction be it pvp, pve, or literally anything else.
---
Then why aren't these people tuning in to Hunter/Hunted radio?  There's never anyone on there.
---
Oh great... Halloween tewards. Just in time for Christmas... so.. will we at least get christmas rewards in time for valentine's day?
---
I remember that from a while ago, i'm just not used to seeing a scorchbeast from the fissure site south west of whisperings dash away to the cranberry bog and over the mountains like it realized it was late for curfew. I couldn't even keep up.
---
You'd first need to define "powerful".
---
There are glass cannon builds that can 1 shot the SBQ.  But these builds rely on a very specific set of buffs that last a very short time interval and also must run insanely low health bloodied and thus are extremely vulnerable and will die when sneezed on.
---
Is that "powerful"?
---
otoh, there are tank builds that can stand in front of the queen solo for hours and never die including tanking all the adds, but don't deal massive damage.
---
more weapons, weapon balance overhaul, and the release of the next raid
---
Too late to be "best game ever" with how the launch was. A game like No Man's Sky was able to recover relatively well from a similarly terrible launch/misinformation and its never mentioned as "best game ever".  Bethesdas done OK to bring people back I think, but ive never considered it to be the best game ever. Its a good game to be sure, I enjoy the hell out of it, but its very shallow in several spots, not accounting for the bugs.
---
I agree with you about the damage.  I'll repair the one at the Munitions Factory, but only to use it as an early warning system of sorts.  Wherever that bird goes, and wherever I hear it firing, is where the next mob wave has spawned and saves me the trouble of running all over creation trying to find it.
---
I should not have said singing, but music and ho ho ho but creepy just the same... love em
---
Cashed in a total of 4800 Scrip from 3 characters during the sale, mostly on 3\* Ranged, and got a lot of disappointment, nothing useful, and only a few I consider vendor worthy.
---
Great to hear - thanks!
---
I think scorchbeasts should be grounded more often
---
Unfair to fight if you're a melee build and can't ground them reliably
---
If you remove the timer you remove the difficulty system. It‚Äôs about the only difference between difficulties.
---
I think something with their flight pathing or whatever was messed up at some point. They seem to be behaving more strangely in a last month or so.
---
I'm always qeued on H/H. It has only reached 4 players three times - and one was during BETA.
---
I really want a free states combat armour paint.
---
It's not that. It's that people prioritized those limited time challenges and missed the actual Halloween event. That was their choice. Just like it was the choice of other people to prioritize the actual Halloween event over the NW limited challenges. I could understand putting it up for 5 days with no restored progress; or 2 days tops with restored progress. That would allow those that were within reach when it was pulled to earn it and those that weren't even close to *maybe* earn it. Instead it's restored progress and 5 days essentially making the limited challenges pointless to do during the time they were actually active.
---
Yep.  Most I ever see is 1/4 on there
---
Just switch bash damage with incendiary since bash is literally useless
---
Agreed. Or at least make wings easier to cripple or something...
---
My least favorite is logging into a nuke zone, that's fantastic.
---
Yeah looking forward to that, the gift mechanic is a cool touch
---
I usually see it for .8-1 cap per bullet. It's easy enough to farm from mutants and now that some people have unlimited stash space I'm surprised the value has stayed as high but it is one of the most popular ammo types.
---
Probably what I'm running currently. I've got really bad luck with getting weapons, but I got a furious gatling gun recently. I'm basically one or two shotting most things, and SBs go down decently fast too. The SBQ is and always has been my worst nightmare fighting though. Never seem to get a good weapon build for fighting her. I think my typical damage with the Gatling gun is around 100-150 per non-crit shot to most things, with the crit shots going up to 200-300+ at times. I still have some tweaking to do though.
---
Not sure why I've been downvoted when it's true
---
You can't expect a melee build to carry guns and ammo that do enough damage to make SB easy
---
That is quite literally the same problem. The risk is not worth the reward. 
---
The reward should inspire people to take on the risks of the activity.
---
You are asking to dumb down the only truly difficult thing we have to do in the game for easier rewards. Upping the ante would be way, way easier of a fix than recoding the difficulty of the raids.
---
It's going to be nice having both and neither one costing me anything.
---
I'm betting something similar to the scorched officers carrying silo pieces.
---
I agree - i've still got several of those halloween cat decorations that absorbed into my walls and foundations sucking up budget :(

That or some sort of wireframe view that would make selecting them easy etc
---
They will try everything to keep a few dollars. It's embarrassing.
---
Keep trying, show them the court ruling. They will give you your money back eventually.

I've often wondered this myself. Q1 2020 is when its "official" timeframe is, but releasing holiday/Q4 2019 makes more sense financially. A common idea in contract work is to slightly overestimate completed work, so you look like a hero when it's completed on time. You tell a person a job takes 2 weeks, and get it done in 8 days, you look like a hero. You tell a person a job takes 1 week and it takes 8 days you look like an idiot. I'm wondering if they overshot their first window, so they added another 5 months for completion but really could have it done in 2 months. No proof, just thoughts I've had for a while. Although those comments in ITV seem a bit out of place.
---
Nerf bloodied!
---
I had a thought for that. I think that the way standard mode is now should be expert mode. So expert mode will still have a timer and have very tough enemies. Standard should be no timer, tough enemies. Novice should be no timer, Weaker enemies. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôd like.
---
I totally agree. Everything else is so casual that is gets boring QUICK.
---
It was never fixed, afaik.
---
Should pick back up for 2x xp, and reintroduction of halloween skins, xmas(?) i assume.
---
You can't do it, but Todd does what Todd wants
---
Probably too hard to do and make it look good. Just snow falling would be fine, but then people would complain about it not accumulating. If they wanted to make it accumulate, they'd have to do it for every static item in the game, which is probably too difficult to pull off.
---
I always thought legendary ammo would have been way better than baking these effects into the weapon itself.
---
&gt; i suggested the repair kits in the past and they implemented them! 
---
[Thank you for that...](https://i.giphy.com/media/soFDqwoP0I6M8/giphy.webp)
---
I don't seeing them removing it since it is a rather well liked mode. The hacking problem just kinda sucks
---
They can't even use the reason of, we can't send money to an Australian back account, I gave provided them with my US bank details and Australian bank details.
---
I don't think so, because they have worked quite hard to make it work, but should they? That's another question.
---
I guess that's also kind of my point though.  A lot of people use the death of Survival as a reason for contesting workshops against players who or 3 or 4 times lower their level;  but if these people would log into Hunter/Hunted, perhaps it would actually fill up.
---
I enjoy defending my workshops against aggressors, but am not going to haul my level 218 ass to the Charleston Landfill and one shot a level 25 noob who's trying to mine lead.  That's not PvP to me.
---
I know it's delayed to 2020 Q1
---
But I don't give a shit about CH stuff .. all I want real permanent content not temporary
---
Soul.
---
Yes. Some of us are attached to those Brahmin.
---
Honestly anyone who does this I pretty much write off as a player I don't want to be around.
---
Month-long events would be really nice...
---
It's the only real money sink in the game tight now, so it will stay valued pretty well. On average I'll shoot 3-5k 5.56 in a day, which is low for a lot of players, but Ill only spend 400-500 caps a day, there is nothing really that I need only fast travel. But I do use ammo, so its where I'd spend money. Lead is the new gold.
---
Not hard enough
---
they worked quite hard to make survival work too.  That was a shitshow, just like NW is turning into.
---
I give it till Q2 2020.
---
Odds are so little anywayy
---
If you have the original and you also get the free Santatron, you can build both and have both run in your camp?
---
Holy shit Juice, do you still play 76? I thought you quit shortly after launch.
---
If if was that well liked it wouldn't be nearly dead.
---
They need to improve the mode to see those numbers go up and like, fix the hacking issue.
---
This is great work, keep showing new builds because they look fantastic.
---
He will randomly give you presents during the holiday.  
---
I assume it will be a candy/junk collector when the holiday season ends.
---
Confirming about prime the plasma. I bought up cheap, nearly depleted cores in player vending, then converted to ultracite with ammosmith and super duper. You'll never need to worry about ammo consumption again.
---
Better than Wild Appalachia tho?
---
Of all the guns in the game to **not** have a suppressor mod...
---
Try perfect storm with the strangler armor to raise hell in pvp
---
That is only correct in a zero-sum view. Those who completed it at Halloween aren't losing anything. No one is taking their earned rewards away. It is only allowing other people to get them. Don't be Scroogeatron.
---
More free states stuff? You guys have more than literally every other faction except raiders.
---
Not if their is money to be made.
---
Lol, k
---
What madman would turn off godrays and fog? Those are like the best features to have in a scenic shot.
---
I just realized sorry
---
One time a few months ago I got a Furious Fire Axe with + swing speed and strength, not my thing but sold it for a small fortune. 
---
Other than that I‚Äôve yet to ever get anything noteworthy from the purveyor.
---
Weird mine were already completed for the weekly yesterday along with some of the dailies. I have the event team completes at 6/10 too. I didn't get to play Tuesday, was at Stanford.
---
For those scorchbeast, it's nice to have some damage. They engage if you hit hard and they're pacified.
---
All good man just letting ya know and clearing it up for whoever's reads it
---
That‚Äôs weird my game runs fine even when playing from NA East on my Aussie friends game
---
Sorry, but this will never reach the level of great games like The Witcher, Fallout 3 and NV, GTA...
---
This will be regarded as an interesting spin-off at most.
---
üò¥
---
I've had it work only some of the time. Even if i'm standing and unloading at them.
---
If they were really working hard, they would have done at least something to fight the hackers. But so far they haven't even acknowledged the issue.
---
Their customer support is probably one of the worst I have ever dealt with, I know how you feel.
---
You can revert the .50 now.
---
Yeah those legend mutants run and hide. They run away while the rest distract. Usually find them tucked away in a room somewhere. I think it's good coding myself =\]
---
Nope. Protect them, milk them, kill them, eat them
---
We will keep our neighborhood pristine even if we must call on the power of atomic fire or FEV!
---
Seems like a pretty popular mode from the communities I've been in. I've been getting back into more myself &amp; there's always a good amount of people playing..this is on PS4.
---
Im sure raider and free states bundles will always find a way back every few weeks.
---
It's not PvP, indeed. It's boring for the "winner" and frustrating for the player that dies, because they couldn't even react.
---
PvP needs a complete overhaul. It just doesn't work.
---
I don't care either way. I'm saying it's dumb to even have these challenges **AT ALL**. And while yes, you are absolutely right. You're failing to see the point of LIMITED TIME challenges that have LIMITED TIME rewards. You can't trade it. You can't drop it. It's literally for showing off. So, what's the point of showing off your now pointless grind because everyone was able to revisit the Halloween challenges during the Holiday challenges? Instead just fucking put it in everyone's crafting table and eliminate the dumb challenges.
---
Yeah when they unveiled the roadmap was good too
---
if you dont go to 3\* your missing out on 15% damage.
---
Yes its worth it.
---
I moved from a location in the mire with a lead spot and water bc I was running through my junk, however I also ran across a dude who's camp was far south and it was legit. Also right next to junk spot. If you're interested I can try to dm you some pics of the locations
---
the people who sell for 2 are ~~stupid~~ savvy.     
---
Never leave money on the table.
---
Better to leave at 1 star in my opinion unless your seriously min maxing. I run all types of bloodied weapons with a focus in rifles so I run one of each commando and rifleman, 3 tank killer and concentrated fire 2, which I swap out for conc 1 with glow sight/green thumbs
---
All I want from Santa is a fast travel fix! I wake up every morning and write him a letter :)
---
You mean the free states salute? Yes its in the shop, but I think it's with one of those packs.
---
We‚Äôre all entitled to our opinions. I enjoy the game a lot but couldn‚Äôt compare it to something like the last of us for story or even something like super Mario world which to me is pretty amazing despite its age and simplicity.
---
Plus, there will be people who get a copy of 76 for Christmas. They won't have much, if any, of a chance to get in on the events. Especially with the need to download 60+ gigs of files.
---
Some of the plans that were datamined are really good as well
---
Some things dont appear to come back. I've been waiting for mosaic tile for a very long time, sigh.
---
No but the endless waves of enemies are a timer in and of itself.
---
It won't be able to coexist with the Santatron.
---
I got an AA SS three star meat hook and BFFR FR western revolver. Oh and a TSE pipe revolver which I almost scripped before checking the value, it‚Äôs now in my vendor.
---
Neither, get a lever. 
---
But if you only have those 2 to choose from, the Handmade is better.
---
I'd like to see either a BOS bundle or an Enclave bundle in the future. I know we can already do BOS combat which is nice but I'd like to see some weapons skins &amp; camp items as well.
---
On my full health guy, I usually shoot em with the instigating dragon for the regen. Aim in third person and you get a dot. Hard hitting weps like instigating or if you're bloodied, gets them to turn red.
---
I guess that would involve creating new game assets like textures and particle effects which is a whole shitload of effort.  Do they do this in other games, I'm curious?
---
It‚Äôs the circle of life!!!üêíüêóüê¥ü¶Åü¶íü¶èüêÜü¶ìüêæüêæüé∂üéµüé∂
---
Oh man, i killed 2 3* legendary ones, farmed their  drops and got disconnected. Game didn‚Äôt saved anything.  Even got my prime ammo back.
---
(Regular scorched beasts btw, no queen)
---
Rifle I do 3 star each, 3 conc fire and 3 tank killer in serious fights.  Non serious I swap one out and run passive perks that are situationally useful.
---
I don‚Äôt see long shot as useful personally.
---
1:1 in my opinion.  I'd prefer the ammo personally.
---
Suuuure Robert House in disguise xD
---
Handmade has much better recoil. The ammo is easier to make too.
---
I also miss them dearly üòî
---
Kill animations, bullet time, Vats criticals and Deathclaw grabs were a big part of the fallout experience and the general gameplay fun. The only ragdoll that you may still witness is the smaller enemies flying around when tackled with a Pain Train perk wielding player.
---
In my opinion, Bethesda should restore at least the real time executions and make them toggleable. During the animations player characters could be immune to any other damage. Such animations are present in games such as Friday the 13th and ESO despite both of them being online.
---
That‚Äôs literally why I bought the fridge. Not for food. For the lawn outside my porch
---
I allways capture a few workshops to use as fast travel points and ive only been contested maybe 5 times in all my play time on PC.
---
If some people buy for 2 than how is it stupid to sell for 2? I would argue the people buying for 2 are stupid since it always sells for 1 elsewhere
---
I've always thought they looked really ugly in fallout
---
Handmade or Fixer for semi auto.
---
Roll them. I am usually in a party. I play the Lone Wanderer game, until they attack. Then my party members come in to help. I tell you, it makes a difference when you have some solid fellas watching your back.
---
Recently did a raid for the second ever time, on novice, with a buddy.   Crickets everywhere, very annoying, it wasn't too difficult but when we got to the end we both said "is that it??" there's no boss?   We talked about how they might make it harder for the other modes, and remembered someone said they were timed, and decided fuck no, no way we're going through that AND have timers, back to nuking whitesprings like regular folk for us :)
---
When you open the Change Apperance menu, it's under Extras, not Face as you might expect it to be.
---
That's a glitch. if you go to NW first or are in NW when the challenges reset then its gunna show any daily or weekly challenge you've done in the past as already completed &amp; you most of the time don't get credit.
---
So pretty much just remake the burrows? Lol
---
 Still better off also having a semiauto large capacity rifle to backup a lever action.  Not all combat is long distance and at times you can get mobbed.
---
Yeah, i was afraid of that. Gonna save some atoms for it.
---
The salute itself is available for 200 atoms for a couple of days.
---
Why do i need to get my hp low with a set of unyeielding for this?
---
Handmade, ammo is easy to get/make, less recoil, and has superior damage
---
I have a lever action and a handmade. The LA does heavy damage but it‚Äôs really slow. Any suggestions?
---
I spent maybe a thousand scrap with my oast spin being a really goid 3* deathckaw gauntet mostly just a lot of rolling pins though
---
Good to know! And, hypothetically, if I went full auto?
---
Glad to hear it! It‚Äôs my favorite weapon.
---
That's a real world reference to something that actually happened in Point Pleasant.
---
Haha nice
---
I guess this is a good point, if there's people who like something more hardcore then it's good there's content for people like you, I shoudn't expect ALL the game to be about me I suppose xD
---
Why did I get 2 down votes? I helped or at least tried like doing so.
---
Having a timer during a raid is just weird. Have some tasks be timed, sure.. but not the entire damn thing! This game is so cursed with lag, poor optimization and all the rest, that have a consistent timer during the whole thing is just asking for trouble. Have phases with checkpoints instead, this isn't a speedrun. 
---
The rewards are an insane grind with how long this is and the daily cooldown, it's not like removing the timer would make it easymode. You still gotta put in the work, DAILY! Just look at the numbers Bethesda, hardly ANYONE bothers doing this activity as it is. It's insane gatekeeping of content.
---
Who knows PC has access to the production of it and bethesda hasn't banned them yet cause Supposidly it exists in game.
---
A lot of Fasnacht decorations can easily double as Christmas decorations.
---
Unless... Update 16, which they included no info on, includes a new (probably short) quest line about repairing towers and inviting people in... Heck maybe a few more steps towards meeting the Overseer.
---
In the Wastelanders trailer, Daniel does make mention that they "heard there's hope here in Appalachia", and that they traveled far (subjective obviously).  If Wastelanders takes place 1 year after the vault opening... Turning on radio beacons to signal an all clear and having pepole arrive and be set up a year later wouldn't be... too far out there.  
---
(Or they just forgot that the delay happened).
---
They're not horribly difficult. With a fairly competent team and a bit of practice all 3 missions are do-able on all difficulties. Expert might be a challenge on particularly laggy servers but its definitely better than it was at launch.  
---
I would like to see the format change for the next Vault raids (for a bit of variety more than anything) but dont want to see the timer removed from these ones.
---
Ah, no biggie. I think that's the last thing I played Monday. Thanks
---
My theory is its gonna be wastelanders, you take a 3 star to an NPC and they upgrade it with flux and other rare mats
---
Because they are Bethesda shills.
---
There's a difference between 'difficult' and 'tedious' though, I don't mind difficult so much.  What REALLY winds me up is when the game says ok you have 20 seconds to do this.
---
1...2...3..4..5..6... ok I'm ready for you to start.... 7... 8...9............10.11.12.13.14...... 15.... 16 17 \*presses button to complete objective\*.... 18.... 19....... 20 You failed start again!!!   What the hell man
---
This surprises you? They don't even give Fallout 1st members their free ATOMs half the time. There's no way in hell they're going to give out refunds, court order or no.
---
Seasonal items should be available at least two weeks before. The appeal of decorations is getting into the spirit leading up to the holiday; it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm going to spend Christmas Day playing FO76. I won‚Äôt even be at home that day.
---
I dunno. Really appreciate your comment.
---
Well it could just be it's a CYA since some may have heard 76 is getting an update and they want to make sure everyone knows it's not out yet.
---
OR
---
MAYBE 
---
An early look/tease of Wastelanders is our collective surprise Christmas Present and will unlock as a separate game mode (like Survival) solely for paid users in Patch 16. It probably won't be the whole full release but maybe it'll be the updated overworld with the new communities in place but no actual new content (ie no NPCs, no questlines, no items) -- simply a self guided tour of the new map to drum of hype for it's eventual 2020 release.
---
or maybe they wrote these things months ago when Wastelanders was penciled in for November and forgot to take it out or figured it simply didn't matter and we should all probably just ignore it and go about our day.
---
As in right now?
---
Correct, I've tun tests on both the Bloodied Swing Speed +1 Strength variations of both the Deathclaw Gauntlet and the Meat Hook.
---
They don't actually seem endless, I shot out the enemies to the point they stopped respawning.  Which was a complete waste of ammo because no XP, but hey I got lots of acid and I'll be eating cricket till May
---
I'm going to give them to January 1st, then I'm going to apply in small claims court, and apply for court sheriff to repo company assets.
---
Thanks :)
---
Yes. [https://imgur.com/NVZjkam](https://imgur.com/NVZjkam)
---
Honestly, after the BoS plan debacle months ago, I learned not to fret over missing out on some rare reward, because chances are, it's not going to stay rare forever.
---
nah just drugs, like fury and psychotats
---
There is, but it's not as straightforward as it would be on PC.
---
I want a Behemoth with dragging a nuclear rocket to launch people into the air while screaming "FOOOREEEE"
---
I really hope that won't be the case. Seems like the best items are the ones they haven't brought back. Like the Mr.Pebbles backpack.
---
Once you have him, you have him forever! He can still be used after the seasonal event he just won't find presents after the event and will still find candies and toys, etc.
---
An actual slow firing .50 cal sniper, like the AMR

---
PS4 remote play is typically on the same WiFi network.
---
Alot depends on legendary stats right i have a two shot explosive assault rifle which is great wvwn though the basic version is weaker than handmade. Good legendary lever actions can be tough to find but lots of great combat and even a few fixers pop up now and then
---
Exactly.  The game always changes, so it‚Äôs kinda foolish to pay out the nose for anything.  It could be super common in two months.
---
Doesn't it give you temporary invulnerability to radiation when you respawn? I'm pretty sure I went through this the other day. I was fighting the Queen without my PA on, died, thought "oh, shit", but was then able to run outside of the blast zone without taking rads after I respawned.
---
You can set it up remotely as well. Someone I was trading with did it while he was at work. Hurm... He might have worked from home though
---
I need to get enough badges to buy one more Backpack mod, then I'm done forever with that joke. Until I need to grind it all over again for my new PvP character... :(
---
I rarely buy ammo that I can craft easily but that makes sense. I use ultracite for most of my guns just because I farm it a lot and you get a lot more with crafting perks.
---
Which state are you in? Vcat in Victoria is very good at this type of thing. I'd start the process now, and cancel it if they fix it, since it is a long process
---
True I have Xbox live anyway but still I know exactly what you mean
---
Carefull with that info or she might become his GF
---
Nah I'm in wa
---
Handmades and fixers are still the best choice
---
Yeah, but it's not like 76 has insane graphical fidelity. Something approaching Skyrim's presentation would be fine by me.
---
I don't expect them to add snow or anything, let alone make it dynamic, but it just struck me as an interesting way to spruce up the otherwise samey appearanace of the Savage Divide.
---
Good on you for making this free! Thank you
---
Im always up for playin with people. KoreyAllen and MoirasBioticPee are my PS names.
---
\^this
---
Oh, I'm all for it. Sorry my post was negative. I just dont think they will commit the time to add it in.
---
It'll probably be taken off the atom shop, but if you got it they won't take away your ability to build it or its presence in your camp
---
You don't happen to have the tricentennial edition do you?
---
On pc i bought one from a player vendor, scapped it for the plans and now sell them in my vending machine. If on pc you should be able to find one ir just ask a super high level to craft you one to trade
---
Awesome! Thanks for the fast response!
---
This actually came up the last time they had a free trial.  They are just being proactive this time.
---
Good to know! I‚Äôve got a TSE LA and Handmade which I love, so I didn‚Äôt know if there was anything better.
---
Perfect, much appreciated!
---
Agreed 100% I don't subscribe to many gaming channels but I do with innovsurvivalist. She gives honest opinions and coverage based on how she feels and not what the MASSES want to see. Everyone is caught up in negative drama and they know that's what gets clicked... Thus spreading negativity. I absolutely hate following Bethesda and Fallout on Facebook and am considering unfollowing based on the negative trolls who only tried the beta, hated it, and kept their opinion on how the game sucks. If juicehead posts a negative video on this event you know it's to make the trolls happy.
---
Same answer.
---
Carry both, you'll just want to use the handmade when there's several enemies that have spotted you, which is most of the time
---
Welcome back

Quad Explosive RW Railway Rifle

AA Power Attack RW Mr. Handy Buzzsaw Blade

Bloodied 50%Crit RW Salvaged Assaultron Head

Nothing truly amazing but I went home happy with some new weapons to play with.
---
The Collectron takes hardly any budget.
---
will it be time gated so its only in game during christmas or if you grab it now is that a permanent unlock
---
This. Or like Dying Light, be able to hit a key and it will show an icon over the body or pile of whatever it ends up being. I like the suggestion of beeping too but I hope it's not an actual beep and is more like the bobblehead or magazine noises. Beeping would drive me crazy lol
---
True but I always keep a little space open for new stuff
---
A fixer with the same legendary effects and mods will out damage a handmade iirc
---
Permanent unlock but one of the things it has a chance of collecting will go away after the event
---
With a F2P weekend and the return of some new cosmetics (along witha. 2x xp) You'll see it pick up.
---
Thank you!! üòä

At the moment I'm using a formatted external hard drive to record (can do that on Xbox and record an hour at 1080p), and I actually record my voiceover separately with my phone and use OpenShot to edit on my laptop. Hopefully I can upgrade how I record and edit next year!
---
When I started on YouTube I just used the basic Windows Editor.
---
Fallout 1st member will be able to in the future is all the info we have. I doubt they will give it to us for free, as much as we want it. Their servers can barely handle what they have goin now, I dont want to imagine if they increased it now without overhauling their stuff.
---
"Geordi, you've got a lot to learn about being a Chief Engineer!  You don't tell the Captain how long it really takes.  How else will you make him believe you're some kind of miracle worker?"
---
sick nice that every christmas bethesda reward veteran players
---
like how last year if you played at any point in 2018 you got fallout 1, 2 &amp; tactics for free and then this year a free collectron 
---
feel rewarded for sticking around and playing the game when things are kinda rough
---
"Bethesda DISRESPECTS paying customers by offering cooler FREE version of Paid Item"

He may have a VPN connection to his home network. Although now that I think about it my primary PS4 is located at my brother's house and I can connect to it via internet but the connection and lag makes it unplayable.
---
Old Guass rifle models ( either from fo3, nv or creation club with the crank, I love cranks). An actual working terminal you can write stuff on, a AA mounted .50 or mini gun for your camp to defend against scorchbeasts.
---
There's a free weekend during the event and it will be on sale for half price. Any progress from that weekend is saved. If they can get in on the event for FREE  and with the sale why would someone wait till Xmas to get it at full price?
---
Ah well for the original commenter this will still help him since he only needs to get to the menu
---
Alternatively you can just use the actual in game object 3d model from game files and convert it to CAD, then make manual adjustments to fit your actual arm dimensions.
---
A competent development team.
---
Very good to know. Perhaps I‚Äôll take the plunge.
---
Maybe it will only switch to collectron mode if you own a collectron.
---
It's a balancing act, you'll have to deal with not being able to have absolutely everything on display at the same time.
---
If they bump up the budget too much, older systems will have more and more issues with rendering everything, so there's limited options for doing that.  They can probably simplify some of the camp items (remove some of the detail), but they can't just bump up the limit without consequences.
---
I like turtles.

And joining the Scorched Earth event puts you in the nuke zone, so you can basically fast travel into a nuke zone that way lol

As someone who has exams and projects for the next two weeks I support this. I know games want to have something going on close to Christmas but jeez why is every game I am playing decided that they will have limited time events during finals, are you trying make me fail my classes?
---
I am very careful about using aid and repair kits now at the SBQ fights. I've missed several because the load time always seems to take several minutes when I happens.

If you store the wall and the put it back, you‚Äôve got the wall and cat saved separate in your menu. Just put the wall back and delete the cat.

Thank you! I'm not there quite yet, official reseller here made a promise to order FO4, so with some luck I'll be in Commonwealth very soon.
---
I‚Äôve found with power armour frames, removing the floor/roof above where you want to put the frame will allow you to move the improperly placed item.
---
     Ran into an issue with the white springs mirror sinking into brick walls, the only way to remove it was to switch the wall to a doorway, ‚Äúpick up‚Äù the mirror, and move it to a different wall there I could then delete it.
---
story, gameplay, multiplayer interactions, you know, the kinda stuff this game would get once it's out of alpha if it wasn't already a fully released 60 dollar game with a 100 dollar a year subscription
---
I completely understand that aspect. I just hope they can find a way to cut somewhere else because I feel like budget fills so fast currently. Maybe it is just certain items that do it but I run no turrets on a relatively small camp and it can only be 1/2 decorated currently
---
If it's visible it's one more item the server has to keep track of. Every custom placed item the server has to monitor will count against camp budget.
---
Love that idea. One of my characters has a "junk yard" off to the side of her house with some crap like a jukebox, old stove, tub and toilet that I like to imagine is where she pulls parts for tinkering. It was really just a way to cover up a firecracker berry bush. But an old fridge would be right at home there.
---
I got mine at the southern lookout tower. Took some server hopping.
---
If innovsurvivalist is allowed to give her honest opinions, why can‚Äôt Juicehead?

The front sights for the 10MM SMG are actually present in the game files. They just don't attach properly. They are supposed to be there though. They're just bugged.

Idk, for all we know they had a team working on it since way back when
---
I dont know how long it's been since you played but just so you are aware you may load in over encumbered and near a train station because there was an update awhile back that took all the pieces off your power armor chassis. I recommend starting fresh with a new character to get your bearings then maybe switch back to your old one.
---
They haven't said anything aside from private servers possibly getting an increase and workshop builds that save.
---
There are some obvious bottlenecks that hold them back from increasing it. Going to an area that has 3-4 fully fleshed out camp builds within site of eachother will cause frame drops and noticably increased server latency. Huge games that are trying to create a massive multiplayer sandbox all run in to this brick wall. Server meshing and optimizing loads on the server sounds simple but it can take entire teams and possibly even years to fully develop. Star Citizen and Dual Universe come to mind. The developers of both treat server meshing and optimization as one of the biggest features in active development. I think Bethesda should follow suit. 
---
Please Bethesda. People would be a lot happier if we saw you publicly acknowledging the issue and telling us what the plan is going forward. Is server meshing a priority? Is it being worked on in any significant capacity? Etc.
---
Does criticizing a game mean hate?
---
Someone's getting coal for sure you grumpy boi
---
More weapon paints.  All weapons should have at least 1 paint.
---
So if that is the case, would it be possible to increase the distance that camps can be placed by other camps to fix that issue?
---
Goddammit now I gotta scrap and rebuild my camp to accommodate the Santa bot and decorations &gt;:(
---
Being able to build in the Towns and cities already on the map. 
---
* Like taking over a house in a Discoverable area (Flatwoods, Beckley, Morgantown, ect..) - same budget limit but smaller building area.
---
* Being able to build somewhere where you don't have to put down a foundation first.
---
His opinion is geared by what's controversial and going to get clicks... Majority of the "gamers" out there hate fo76 so they're gonna click his video to get epic lolz and share them with others to get epic lolz.
---
Sometimes it's hard to tell what makes up all your budget, but there are things that absolutely take up a ton.  Turrets and lights most people know about, but anything with a lot of polys and textures.
---
Best thing to do is add/remove things and watch the budget bar, and avoid anything that takes big chunks.  If there was a way to display an accurate number along with the bar (which may be something a mod could do), I'd be willing to pitch in to help catalog the costs.
---
Is bias a bad thing in this case? You‚Äôre clearly biased to one channel over the other, but you shouldn‚Äôt be hated on for that; why are opinions on a video game any different?
---
Junk Junk Junk and a Bloodied limb damage Fixer.
---
I was told it died...months ago
---
WOT
---
Idk I feel as If a fallout 4 or skyrim snow mod probably exsists that does exactly that to those games..... and that's one person. Why wouldn't Bethesda be able to do it with an entire professional paid development team.
---
Interesting, did you find that st whitespring?
---
True. Or simply deleting them one by one from the menu where you can see the given item count. It's not perfect and may require deleting all of them, but at least it would give us much more control over the budget. CAMP walls and foundations aren't really a problem since you can always remove them along with the stuck items and then place them again. In-game structures like walls and ground are a different story. I could easily rebuild my base but still, I would rather not have to do it just because I may forever lose the ability to place two machines at once.
---
Totally understandable. I think the game launched in a pretty bad state but I definitely went overboard with some of my videos
---
I usually play NW at least a hour per day. Probably have close to a dozen friends that do the same. IMO it would be the best BR if they smoothed out the stability issues on console.
---
Fair point.
---
LOL!
---
Damage type shouldn't matter as long as you damage them. For the queen, you have to damage them a certain amount before they'll drop stuff. How much damage for the queen, I don't know. For all other enemies, you should only need to tag them and they'll drop stuff. So if you're tagging things (other than the queen, of course) and they aren't dropping stuff, you may have a bug or you may have missed and just aren't aware of it.
---
They‚Äôre geared towards what‚Äôs most controversial? I wonder if that has to do with the fact that FO76 is a controversial game that adds more fuel to the fire with its own updates. And it‚Äôs not like he hasn‚Äôt put out positive FO76 videos, I‚Äôd consider his most recent FO76 video pretty positive.
---
Hahahaha!
---
They shouldnt countdown during npc talking. Add server lagg to that and delay was some times 1,5 - 2 min. lol
---
(This was week 1 &amp; 2 and on expert)
---
You're not gonna wait till Xmas to open it are you?! HeHe
---
Wait so, if i didnt bought any collectron this free version will do the same?
---
+karma
---
It was in a suitcase outside Pleasant Valley Station. It does nothing but disappear when clicked. It's the second one I found.
---
Find a FFR lever action and run the hair trigger receiver. Plenty fast then, and if Bloodied the damage is still more than enough. For that matter find a FFR Fixer too.
---
Radeon.
---
I'd guess that these slow/pause gameplay like VATs and in FO4 with single player it didn't hurt anything but in an online multiplayer game like FO76 you can't slow/pause the gameplay
---
My opinion is just my opinion. I talk about neutral or positive stuff all the time? Was there something major and positive that I didn't cover or something Bethesda did that was really good and I did not give them praise?
---
Damn, that‚Äôs crazy. Fixers are pretty good at pvp too
---
it got shut down by the owner, because the owner and mods got caught being involved in fucked up practices like price rigging.
---
if you search market, then put 76 on the end of it, thats the good sub and you will want to head over there
---
It is supposed to give you plans / aid items / caps
---
CAMP structures aren't that much of an issue. I have my base in a metro cart that has quite a thick ceiling structure on it, so when I place an item inside, it may end up on the roof or inside that cart structure without me being able to reach it from either side but the count still says I've got some items.
---
If you find a BE or BFFR Combat rifle for a good price though don't hesitate. A BE or BFFR combat rifle out damages a normal Bloodied Fixer or Handmade by a good amount.
---
Wait what is this santatron? What does it do?
---
And there comes the sloppy logic/rhetoric. 
---
Lets be clear. Everyone that ends up with those rewards will have completed the challenge. Yes some people with have gotten more time to finish. That doesn't mean that "everyone" will have it, just the people who are willing to work for it.
---
If flexing game achievements is THAT important to you (if so you REALLY might want to broaden your horizons) and you just HAVE to have a limited time outfit untarnished by the confusion of the first challenge ending earlier than expected, feel free to go for the holiday ones. It is unlikely that Beth will make the same mistake again and you should be able to flash your SUPER SPECIAL pixels at McDonalds to get your fries faster.....oh wait. No you actually won't.
---
I dunno. I stopped watching your videos after finding out that you primarily focus on the negative aspects of this game. I rather watch positive coverage and hope for the future. That's why innovsurvivalist is so intriguing.
---
Same thing as a Collectron except it gives candy, toys or coal instead of junk. Valseek says if you already have a regular Collectron then you can set it to the same settings because you can only have one of either. But tbh I don't know why you would because this free Santatron is better in every way
---
Because mom and dad already bought it or something? I guarantee there are people who have it on their wishlist who don't hang on Bethesda's every Inside the Vault and will have no idea there's a free trial coming up. We are all the exception and not the rule for sure.
---
IMO probably better off giving them to mid to high levels so he knows they're not going to play till level 20 and quit.
---
That'll be 800 Atoms ;)
---
It would be a nice Christmas present but my main concern would be them putting out something just before the holidays that ends up being buggy and then there not being anyone around to fix it..
---
That's true as well, I think that eventually Ult 5.56 will be the new standard for mass production, (gold) regular 5.56 a bit lower (silver) and caps as a slightly necessary but low valued currency (copper). Markets over time stabalize as long as there is not a sharp increase in currency (ie dupers duping 5.56/ult 5.56 and flooding the market).
---
Uh.... we are in very late Q4 2019, brother. If they release Wastelanders now, I guarantee it will be a bug riddled shitshow. Let them work on it.
---
Yeah. After i already wasted atoms on it.
---
What is the purpose of candy or toys? Except toys being cars etc to then scrap for junk
---
How to avoid PVP at workshops:
---
- crouch before entering the zone. Stay crouched.
---
- crafting, sleeping or jamming will de-stealth you
---
- set up as quick as possible. Dont build extractors you do not need. Leave immediately.
---
- ignore "defend" quests. The "retake" quest does not appear on the map as a travel target.
---
- The "retake" quest spawns all npcs in one wave, reducing completion time.
---
- use the fast travel mat. Worshop/misc/fast travel target. Place it right next to your resources. Saves time.
---
- use the wire glitch to avoid fussing with conduits. Snap a conduit on another object. Attach wire to conduit. Pick up object, spin and place down. Now moving it anywhere will ignore wire rules.
---
My favorite workshops:
---
- hemlock holes (acid)
---
- Berkley springs (water, lead)
---
- munitions (lead, ammo)
---
Ah good luck
---
One problem is I'm on console and I'm not sure if that is possible to do so.
---
Um, I‚Äôm sorry,  but I‚Äôm a melee build with a strength of 15 and I still carry a handmade, and a Gatling plasma for SB fights.
---
[response from Bethesda earlier](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e6jd0l/itv_free_trial_double_xp_and_holiday_scorched/f9qziti/)
---
True, this has crossed my mind as well, bugs are inevitable, they can't test 10 billion possible things us weird players do. But, I think they were trying to work the kinks out as much as possible in this last month and a half for that exact reason.
---
I think this is actually aclot more likely to get people into the idea of fo76 moving to free to play. 
---
FO1st is making enough to offset the cost of slowed new game purchases, and atom transactions can float the rest. Ramp up userbase as much as possible for people trying game for first time and realizing that much of the "OMG game sux! Fuck Bethesda" drama hopefully does die down in time for wastelanders to launch and game gets a "second look" period similar to destiny 2 and no man's sky that objectively had a lot of similar bad press at launch.
---
they‚Äôre going to butcher everything and we‚Äôre going to grind thru and continue to open our wallets anyway.
---
Just come out of stealth and go back after they notice you...
---
Give these guys a call:
---
State Administrative Tribunal
---
Level 6, State Administrative Tribunal Building, 565 Hay Street, PERTH WA 6000 or GPO Box U1991, Perth 6845
---
Phone: (08) 9219 3111 or 1300 306 017 (cost of a local call)
---
Cheat terminal, world manipulation, move position y or x by 200.  It's very possible.
---
You mean ‚Äúa really nice thing the *developers* are doing‚Äù
---
From what I have read, they can be forced to land with a shotgun and the enforcer perk (agility) by crippling the wings, even without using the shotgun damage perks.
---
But in what way to I primarily focus on the negative aspects? I talk about the negative, positive, and neutral stuff. I think as of late there has been a lot of negative but I don't think I have avoided any positive things.
---
If you own the standard Collectron, you'll have the option to make the Santatron collect junk or scrap just the same.
---
I read that part about wastelanders not being available on the trial and thought ‚Äúwhy mention it if it‚Äôs not ready yet‚Äù gonna go ahead and say it‚Äôs a surprise gift for all the fuckery the last year.
---
Use an overlay tool like the Nvidia Freestyle mode. You can pretty much make your own reshade doing that, and it looks fantastic.
---
As far as textures... there's some chance some of the 4K texture mods from FO4 can be ported over. Maybe try asking mod authors of the 4K texture mods if they are interested in porting them to 76 or look for mods with open permissions for porting to other games and then contact one of the 76 mod authors that have done texture work and see if they want to take the job of porting them.
---
It is a separate bot. 
---
It‚Äôs a free bot that you either have to choose to have the a Santatron or the original Collectron in your camp. Can‚Äôt have both. Was confirmed by LadyDevann.
---
That's my point, I just have this gut feeling that sales will drive decisions not developers/customers. I don't want a push for release, I've just got worries it will be
---
You didn't waste atoms on it. The Santatron can only collect pure junk if you have the Collectron. So otherwise you're just getting candy, toys or coal
---
I could give you one so you can scrap it
---
Would live BOS bundle, but to OP' s point, a complete bundle, all armor, and or all rifles/ pistols ... Not some strange bits and peices.
---
this is also my greatest pleasure
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e6jd0l/itv_free_trial_double_xp_and_holiday_scorched/f9qziti/
---
After the Event only Candy, Toys, and Coal
---
It‚Äôs unlimited scrap/junk. Not unlimited stash space.
---
Its great they are giving this for free but can I get a refund on the atoms I spent on the collectron? Its pretty lame you can't have both running at the same time.
---
Those damn bears are the most dangerous things in the game. If I can stand on something where they can‚Äôt get me I might try to take one on with grenades and guns. Most of the time I just run like hell.
---
It seems like your the biased one friend
---
But first... let me take a selfie!
---
Im asking if i need to buy the regular collectron to be able to switch the santatron to a junk collector instead candy
---
I don't see it as anything more than a notice for those unaware that Wastelanders was delayed.
---
And what if i dont have the regular collectron? Can i use the santatron to collect junk?
---
I'm convinced whoever makes decisions on what's always available and what rotates out is smoking crack. 
---
Why they dont have more skins available all the time for the more popular weapons and armors, is just beyond me.
---
Wait, so are the Christmas items already out?
---
Not until we get the elite riot helmet, thanks.
---
unyielding. but frankly just the fixer/handmade and sneak perks will do. unyielding will give you tons of AP and help you stay hidden (+agi) plus vats accuracy (+per). you could make use of crits as well (+luk) but with bloodied the difference is marginal. lots of carry weight, too.
---
I like better sneak for the 3rd. enemies will almost never spot you. but you can't go wrong with ap refresh and sentinel, either.
---
Omg!!!!!! 800 caps!!! Lol I‚Äôll pay you 1000 caps lol JK!!!!
---
On the Xbox there's no customize setting
---
Maybe just there is no confusion people might think they would be getting something and being disappointed/pissed when they don't
---
Fire and Brimstone, eh? I guess that's one approach to news or ideas, to each their own
---
Nah next week judging by the news
---
No. Only candy, toys, coal
---

---
Unless it‚Äôs bugs, I‚Äôd say you can usually equate most of the negatives to Bethesda as a whole. Good decisions like this usually can‚Äôt, the most the suits would have said about the Santatron would be: ‚ÄúGood idea! That‚Äôll help get our image back into the green!‚Äù
---
Mines have been detonating slower and slower woth each new fallout game it seems lol
---
You expected a free robot to have more functionality than the one for 500 atoms? Collection rate is so small anyway so it really shouldn‚Äôt matter.
---
This week is week 1.
---
I dont expect smart movements from bethesda lately lol
---
I think it is labeled as change appearance. It will be one of the smaller text options above logging out of the world. So pull up you map, then the menu and it should be toward the bottom. Then as someone else said it will be under extras once you have it up
---
&gt; Edit: its a single emote at a price of 200 atoms.
---
Oh, I thought it was the salute itself.  Hope I didn't steer the OP wrong.
---
40 scrip
---
Having both a BE Gatling Plasma Build and a BFFR Fixer Stealth Commando build, I think you have those in the wrong order. No gun in the game will beat the BE GP.  Even the non-Bloodied Legacy GP will out-damage the Commando.  If you are basing damage on that website calculator, I suspect it isn‚Äôt calculating legacy explosive damage like it is actually in-game.
---
The highest DPS gun in the game for a commando would still be a BE GP.
---
For like, 5-8 sec or something like that. If you are good with the quick menu and spam radaway you can escape
---
More weapon mods that should already be in the game. Like the 10mm SMG suppressor that it had in previous fallout games or the other missing attachments in 76 that were present in Fallout 4. Doesn‚Äôt make much sense as to why stuff that was in the previous game isn‚Äôt in 76 considering it‚Äôs basically the same game but reskinned and added multiplayer.
---
It got shutdown , sucks too because the market sub reddit is super strict and the bazaar would let you say whatever as long as you told what you were selling
---
I would not be mad at having checkpoints, and maybe a bit more time.  Needing a shotgun to cripple trash mobs is kinda stupid.
---
It‚Äôs incredibly difficult to press buttons and things while 4-5 enemies are jostling you around.  I pretty much give up if I have to mess around with the circuit breakers.
---
It's not constantly popping, but I've never had to wait more than a few minutes to find a match in the past month.
---
Playing PC, time zone between ~4pm - 10pm PST.
---
Play on PC if you like playing with hackers and cheaters.
---
Graphics have potential to be a bit better on PC, but not by much.
---
Consoles are more stable.
---
Are you really complaining about the santatron?
---
lol yes i was being serious. You see, at the core of any ‚Äòbuild‚Äô is the weapon (unless you‚Äôre Bruce Lee), and that good weapon isn‚Äôt easy to come by. You can grind a thousand hours and never come across one. Or maybe you already got it and sold it for cheap before realizing how useful it is. 
---
But for the dupers they duped a boatload of ‚Äògod tier‚Äô they could get their hands on, then use those as currency to trade for the latest ‚Äòmeta‚Äô. Unsuspecting gamer joe thought to himself ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not into this bloodied thing, why don‚Äôt I trade this useless bloodied explosive fixxer mama murmrgh gave me for that beautiful explosive pistol and five other god rolls this guy is offering. Next thing you know some duper is high-fiving his moms and uncles and everyone is sporting a BE fixer the next day.
---
Thx for the reply, hopefully they get their server speed up because I cant make it past the atom shop splash they throw at you lol.
---
I accidentally got one of my smoke machines stuck in a boat, and I can't retrieve it without moving camp. Camp took like 6 hours to set up, really don't feel like doing it again, so RIP smokemachine. I feel your pain.
---
It is kind of funny how we can craft everything from machine guns to fusion reactors, but none of us have figured out how to build a bicycle.
---
That I'm warned that I can be dicked over doesn't mean that I shouldn't have a choice.  When I first started this game I thought it would be more of a high noon thing where another character "called me out" to defend my claim, instead it is the epitome of claim jumping which everyone should despise.
---
I also wish that fusion cores could be inserted into our fusion generator and charged back up.
---
yup!! i built around and put a broke toilet and other pretties decorating an old truck on one of my builds including a pink Christmas tree, right outside the house.
---
Congrats man, thats a nice weapon
---
I know youtubers can make videos out of nothing but its not like alot could be said about this to make a video out of it. Its one free bot,its nice but its not going to make much of a difference like bringing people back to the game or anything while some of the negative things were enough to make people leave the game. Glad they did put out something without the price tag though,its a start
---
Probably too late to get anything in Wastelanders, but that would definitely be a cool quest chain.  Wouldn't bother even asking you to name him.  It'll be "Dogmeat."  It's always Dogmeat.
---
I see this claim all the time. 800\~ hours of time logged on PC and I've yet to run into **one** blatant exploiter. I don't play NW however (I'm to understand its terrible, frankly).
---
Do display cases have separate budgets? I have three Vault-Tec party hats in one case, and the game always tells me that my budget is exceeded when I try to add the fourth hat, no matter how much camp budget remains.
---
There is another coming with the Xmas evwnt
---
Dear OP, could you maybe read the Inside the Vault posted today.  Just a thought.
---
I can't speak for One X, but there isn't a comparison in my experience between PS4 &amp; PC. Stability and performance is much higher on the PC. 
---
Plenty of UI, QoL and aesthetic mods on PC if that is your kind of thing. Perk Loadout Manager is damned useful (supposedly this/something similar will be added to all systems in the future).
---
Nice. Until Wastelanders drops (if ever), it'll be something at least.
---
&gt;Play on PC if you like playing with hackers and cheaters.
---
Only applicable for NW.  Very few active cheaters in Adventure, with one exception, which is duping.  THAT is not restricted to PCs, though it's been more uncommon until recently.
---
Also, most people rarely run into duped items at all either way.
---
&gt;Graphics have potential to be a bit better on PC, but not by much.
---
The could be (with mods), but honestly the game is poorly optimized enough that you don't really want to push the graphics much.
---
&gt;Consoles are more stable.
---
Definitely false.
---
Or better yet, fix them so they can be leveled up. Some unique weapons allow you to do this, others do not. Guess it makes too much sense to be consistent. &lt;smh&gt;
---
I‚Äôve played the game and lost my original account thanks to Bethesda‚Äôs great engine. Miss my BE rifleman :(
---
I haven't done that yet. But I will,  just a thought
---
So there is limited modding for the game? Will that get you banned by Bethesda tho?
---
The issues that exist now are more annoying, there's nothing truly game breaking.... or at least a reasonable workaround is known. Because they have fixed a lot of stuff and continue to do so, there's far more complaining about staleness. They are also using this Christmas Holiday event to address some of the things people have been complaining about. Mainly extremely hard to find plans, like the Plasma Grenade Plan that dropped to a reported .001% chance of dropping from  4 random events in the Ash Heap.
---
tl;dr they know they have to keep both set's of complainers happy. Some want new content some want more bug fixes.
---
also, you should get the game, it's cheap and fun!
---
The issue with this is that screen shots are stored locally on your system.  Bethesda could implement the ability for you and only you to see your screen shots, but visitors would never see you content.
---
If Bethesda did enable image upload (in order for other users to see your content) then that would open the system up to non-Fallout images being uploaded as well (hint that is bad).
---
Fighting Strangler Heart in standard Dead in the Water is like "We only have 20 minutes, whatever shall we do?"
---
On Novice the enemies stop spawning after awhile, and you can run around fixing pipes and finding keys, or whatever.
---
Pretty much all Tesla's have some worth since they are great event weapons for tagging enemies. I would probably list it at 1k in my vendor.
---
Exactly the same here. Only one useful item is a bloodied ffr gat laser, but i already have two of those. Everything else was only good for scripper.
---
So they do it both at the same time? Damn! No wonder it gets released so late, they‚Äôre making sure no new bugs occur, fixing old ones, and making new content!
---
On our last attempt at a Vault raid, my friend and I made it to the untimed room before the final push. She tried to get out of her PA to make some repairs and froze. Heartbroken. I tried to go on, but I couldn't complete it by myself. It's a tremendous waste of resources for no return :-(
---
Lol it wasn't that crack head ladydevann... it was valseek, weirdo.
---
PC has fewer kids not to say that some of the older players are much better. It's nice being able to run multiple copies when you need to move stuff. Graphics can be better. PC is probably less stable since changes come more frequently. Being able to run mods is nice but can be problematic when new updates come out. Hackers and the like are more common on PC but still fairly rare outside of NW.
---
"I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd have been able to complete any raids at all if it weren‚Äôt for private servers. They‚Äôre simply unplayable in public servers because of the lag. The raids are basically locked behind Fallout 1st because of this"
---
Says it all really.
---
regardless of how fun it is or how much you like it you gotta admit it was kind of fucked at launch.I didnt even play it until the free trial in April?I think. Even then on my base ps4 it was pretty fucked.I do understand as a game like the fallout games have so much going on that its going to be hard for them to perform online but if ya pay for a game I expect it to work alittle better.
---
I certainly hope so, too.
---
also hope my post didnt come off as an attack on you, sorry if it did. 
---
but yeah, i hope things get smoothed out because i am going to play regardless lol
---
Quit whining.
---
I have definitely gotten some stuff wrong in my coverage (leaked consumer data), but I definitely knew you had to scrap things to learn mods and that mods were a thing. I actually remembering a critique of mine being that despite them adding many new weapons, only the pump felt like it got significant love in the weapon mod department.
---
Also, would it be on par with explosive? Or would they have to rework explosive? However, not killing yourself would be a bonus.
---
It's actually not a client issue. All of these items are queried from a normal database outside of the hosting server into an in-memory storage database on the hosting server when a player loads in.
---
They've obviously allocated X amount of GBs for camp budgets per server and have that baked into their AWS hosting plans' specifications.
---
So to get higher camp budgets, and higher stash limits, they have to increase the cloud hosting resources dedicated to each server shard which, obviously, increases the cost of the hosting.
---
I'd scrip it
---
Graphics will be pretty much the same outside mods (which are mostly PC only, but there isn't a huge number available).
---
XB should be pretty stable, newer consoles seem to be mostly fine.  PC tends to be very stable, but that will depend on your rig.  It's a bit of a crap shoot there, I'm just about rock steady on an OK-level rig that's 3 years old.
---
PC vs console will really come down to whether you like to play more on keyboard or controller.  That's a religious discussion I won't get into, but if you have a huge preference, that will effect the answer (you can likely play with a controller on PC, or a keyboard on XB, but I haven't any experience with either of those).
---
Probably toys because the cars have screws and they know we need screws.
---
I gave up due to cheaters. I'm sure a lot of others did too.
---
Of course, thanks for being so open! I think I was being a bit hyperbolic by calling the creation club prices outrageous relative to the atom shop. The point I want to highlight is that atoms can be earned for free by players in opposition to creation club credits. I certainly couldn‚Äôt defend the prices for the atom shop if they weren‚Äôt free.
---
I really appreciate the content you make around Fallout 76 and I still look forward to each one. You also seem like a really sensible, down to earth man which I commend! I hope I didn‚Äôt come off as trying to insult your intelligence or authenticity. Everyone is free to play the game at their own pace :)
---
Lol yeah... this is dumb. I'll use it, but it's not anything amazing bethesda. Good job impressing the idiots though. Lol
---
No worries, lot of videos a long time ago so it is easy to confuse
---
Fastnacht was not supposed to come back before end of year... the entire event is about the end of winter.
---
Throw the mine down then shoot it when you want it to go off still a trap just not how it should work.
---
It also depends on PC versus Console. People on this sub talk about _constant_ issues with griefing and unwanted PvP and I'm pretty sure they're all PC based.
---
On console, over the course of my 2 level 100+ characters, I'd say I've been griefed once, and had never had the workshop contested until the survival servers went down. Heck, most times on Xbox I'd play and never even see another person unless I went to their camp.

It's weird, but I think in this one instance... the console players are the civilized folk?
---
Nope, it's fully stuck in the boat. Can't highlight or grab it.

I like how you think your downvote matters
---
I would agree if it wasnt for the lack of content in general other than the queen really isnt much to do unless u like wasting caps on encryptid
---
At least there are perks available to reduce weapon weights for heavy weapons. Try carrying a few modded rifles....at 20+ lbs each, they add up fast.
---
Whatever it is, its not enough to even get inside power armor on AU ping
---
So.... Confused.
---
Free trial runs December 12 to 16th....
---
But "Won't feature any of the new wastelanders content"....
---
Wastelanders was pushed to next year. Am I missing something here?
---
I only use mines on my shotgunner, cripple them then toss mines down gor them to crawl over
---
Very true there. I haven't played on Xbox aside from the B.E.T.A. really (met a lot of kind people there), whereas on the PC I've really only either run into jerks or a small handful of people that I could work with. Lately it hasn't been too bad, but I've also only really been going on public servers to check out shops for legendary weapons.
---
Perk Mutation, allow select perks to be customized to behave differently (Ex. Scrounger *: all containers can be searched but the amount of ammo found will be reduced)
---
Have hundreds of the stuff
---
Do the miners maps in Ash Heap. Get lots that way
---
 With a melee weapon? Anyone can stand on the bus.
---
Considering the shitfest of not having the Collectron available to everyone this is a v good step they took
---
There's no way they could add in dynamic snow without demanding more from the hardware: players choose to install mods, so if we install something that our system can't handle it's our own damn fault. But Bethesda has to optimize their graphics for PC and consoles, so they can't just release an update that increases the hardware requirements and makes performance even worse for console players.
---
Still holding
---
This is accurate.
---
Some people are assholes.
---
That's correct, 14k XP. I got about halfway there last time, before I got tired of Nuclear Winter and decided I wanted a break more than I wanted a glowing skeleton suit.
---
good question, I haven't tried that!
---
You said a bloodied build would kill one with ‚Äúone shot‚Äù and then get mobbed to death.  When I think of shooting something, I think of guns, not melee. And no, I don‚Äôt stand on a bus, that just causes the ghouls to run away.  I just mow them to death coming out the front door.  Super easy.
---
This happened to me very early in the game before camp damage was addressed 
---
Accepted a team invite, and a team of high levels swooped in and killed me and trashed my camp.
---
Oh yeah. My favorite is I wait a few minutes to take care of my own things and then I teleport there and she's already dead along with 3 legendary scorchbeasts.
---
raids have been literally this years biggest flop
---
&gt;Not all aspects of this game HAVE to be casual.
---
yes they have otherwise you will have vault 94 which almost nobody does
---
Yikes. I also never listen to the radio while playing. No idea if that is actually connected haha
---
Hmm i want one badd
---
Yes had it happen to me the other day when I owned the ammunition workshop. Had 2 people show up and tried taking it. Ended up killing both of them several times but then 4 more showed up and killed me and took over the workshop. They followed me around harassing me and eventually stopped. Come to find out, they stopped harassing me to harass a lvl 10 player, which they killed instantly. All the players were level 80 to over 300. People suck. Luckily it‚Äôs the minority.
---
Darn..
---
No I think it‚Äôs funny 
---
Like blowing up cars!!
---
No.  They have brought back many many things from the vault.  It's actually kinda funny they say "get then before they're gone" cause they are never permanently gone.  They come back whenever they need an influx of cash.  But if they are always going to come back eventually the urgency to "buy them before they're gone" is nil lol
---
Hmm
---
Dont open it. Its a trick used by hackers to get accounts banned.
---
These things are *NOT* supposed to be released. They were hacked in and mass-duped, and i would be careful with having one in your inventory.
---
Outer Worlds was meh and not even really close to what Fallout is. Can people stop comparing Fallout and the Outer Worlds please TOW was good in its own way and Fallout is good in its own way just because they have some similarities does not make them the same type of game
---
Do you know about how the contractor perk?
---
i wonder if latency could cause the game to drop.
---
are you using party chat? a few weeks back it was giving me big issues if i was also using chat. as soon as i stopped using chat the problems pretty much ceased.
---
Yeah I mainly do it to get meat lol. Always food hungry. But lately been farmin west tek so glowing danger doggos feed me.
---
Unless it‚Äôs an auto or with FFR I‚Äôd scrip it
---
for max amount of damage max them out.  the rest of the perception perks are pointless. :3
---
I gave up on in game radio. Made my own playlist with the one Appalachia radio songs. Its better to have some variety.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve done this once or twice, I turned my Xbox off for the night
---
I hope wastelanders doesnt flop...
---
Just keep in mind that there's presently an exploit (and yes, Bethesda has formally called it an exploit) where players are being killed through Pacifist Mode using radiation damage.
---
I just don't feel like I should have to run around in pacifist all the time, sometimes there is room for quality PVP, but I get what you're saying. Thanks for the sympathy
---
Would be nice if they added in fucking matchmaking for people who don't have dedicated friends to play with. Game is played soloable my arse
---
It helps to know I'm not alone in this, sorry it happened to you too man
---
The way the effects were modified from Fallout 4, and the fact that they're labeled in the data as 4th and 5th star effects, suggests to me that they will be implemented at some point, rather than being cut content or vestigial Fallout 4 data. 
---
Nonetheless they will have to be modified a little before they're implemented. One of the 4th star effects uses a projectile override like Explosive does, which means it'll cause the same bugs if it's enabled on energy weapons *and* it'll overwrite/be overwritten by the Explosive modifier if a weapon has both. And the Bleeding damage one looks identical to Fallout 4's, which was *absurdly* powerful because it stacked and ignored armor, so Wounding automatics/shotguns were the most busted weapons in the game.
---
I have to believe that there's gotta be an answer to this; I'm sure someone's tried it.   I started experimenting with glitch/underground builds after seeing others doing it, and I know since then that so many people were doing this that others started to complain.  
---
It's tricky to find a good spot to glitch through.  Often times there's layers of graphics (a retaining wall, then a mountain side after that, etc...), so you may glitch through one and be "trapped" in between with nowhere to build.   There's a variety of different interactive objects that could be used.  I used a couch.  I've seen people have good results with instruments.  But the most commonly used is the cooking pot.  And at some point, people started complaining of going to camps and having to use multiple cooking pots to glitch through the various layers of graphics when all they wanted was to use the vending machine lol
---
Pretty sure they'll drop the 10th or the 12th since that's when the christmas event starts ^-^
---
It's something they didn't have to do though, it's not sad to be thankful for something they weren't required to do
---
Yeah I wrote this before inside the vault dropped. Thanks.
---
He simply gives his audience what they want. The way he covers the game annoys me but I understand the dude has to make a living. If the "fallout community" changed over night and became more supportive of the game, I'm sure the way he covers the game would change overnight too.
---
Like I said in OP, I wouldn't care even if Bethesda fixed it for me at this point, I'm just venting
---
But yes I am aware
---
Drop it like it's hot....like radioactive....in the super-bad-account-banned kinda way
---
I've always got the impression that at least half of the crafting we do is more of a gameplay thing, and lore wise a lot of stuff we just salvage from other locations. Explains why we would 'build' rotten sofas, broken chairs, etc and is a lot more plausable than building fusion reactors from scratch single-handedly.
---
Or better yet, when it doesn‚Äôt crash and it still doesn‚Äôt give you any loot
---
Ya people use the mutation exploits to get you as well. Seems the griefing picks up when we run out of content.  Hopefully the Christmas event tides them over for a bit
---
Big deal.
---
I volunteer.
---
You are now Karen.
---
Be responsible with this power.
---
the one i saw was a banjo...it seemed that he placed a foundation on a 30-40 degree grade and had stairs attached under the map to the foundation, then a banjo stock poking out of the dirt...i was hoping to replicate this at the campgrounds workshop for testing, then build and nuke...plain and simple
---
Actually had almost exactly that happen to me in the past as well, although I ended up logging out after they killed me a few times lol. Sorry that happened though man, I appreciate the solidarity
---
I get that... but the whiny babies going on about youtubers not covering this is wrong. I watch several content creators covering fallout, and the majority of them talk about stuff like this.
---
And there's nothing wrong with covering the negatives. It's all information, and opinion. I appreciate them doing little things for us..
---
 But the matter that really stands... is they have their hands right up our asses, and most of the playerbase is comfortable with that mass in their ass... I on the otherhand, kinda feel constipated.
---
Sure, why not.  Could be fun.
---
because if you get on a server and you are the only one that wants pvp you wont get peope queing up for hunter vs hunter? not only taht theres no global notification/ server queu  for players that want hunter vs hunted making it a dead mode.
---
Glad you got in!
---
That's so cool I didn't even know this weapon existed in the game
---
I agree.  I'd start with 1,000 and work down from there.
---
A Tesla isn't usually going to be a primary means of killing something (outside of PvP) since it's not a very strong weapon, so the benefit of Executioner is a bit dubious.
---
I want 6 settlers 10 at most idc if theyre worth 2 turrets each let me start a lil community out in the bog
---
Ahh, that might've been what did it. I haven't heard of mutation exploits but I do have most of them, and I could see the splash damage ones having an effect like that
---
Really?? If you don't mind explaining, how does that work?
---
+karma Tysm!!
---
It was kinda fucked at launch, but what was more fucked was the YouTube response and what it did to this community in the long term. 
---
YouTubers (including juicehead) spun this game into a joke. There are plenty of things to be critical about, but turning it into a sitcom for views was insanely wrong.
---
I only partially blame the streamers though, the parrots that repeat everything they say without playing the game themselves are equally shitty.
---
You act like NW isn't the most fun part of FO76
---
I‚Äôll walk around taking photos of their CAMP while complaining
---
How do I access the cheat terminal?
---
Pshh, you act as though you could just run electricity through some type of conductive coil to produce heat on demand. Obviously it's not that simple.
---
It's also strange that the brewing station requires wood for fuel when it's pretty clearly a propane or other gas-based heating system.
---
Nice off you to think that I was the one kicking you down a vote  but it wasnt me. I was merely stating a fact and im not one of those petty reddit-jockels who feel the need to emphasise their points with downvotes.
---
Ya, the mutation that sends a shockwave out initiates pvp so idiots run around smacking people hoping it procs. I've also seen griefers run in front of players shooting or swinging at monsters hoping they get hit.
---
You got it!
---
The 'infinite enemies' thing is the laziest thing Bethesda could do for challenge.
---
And they did it.
---
Yes they are
---
I just want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not asking for a casual experience. Just something a little less daunting. A way to get the gear without killing myself.
---
Perfect. My black powder does 3√ó the damage of my .50 sniper
---
It‚Äôs called novice, there‚Äôs multiple levels for a reason
---
Episodes like this always warm my heart.  Thanks for sharing n.n
---
Yep! If the machine would keep high scores by recording the gamer tag.....Epic!
---
I think this would rock
---
I appreciate that you can recognize that, and I realize your videos are not anywhere near soley responsible, just a tiny part of it.
---
I just don't know how it will ever be fixed. People who have never played the game make fun of it with the platitudes they picked up on YouTube all the time when I mention the game. It is out in the wild and people don't forget that stuff.
---
Thanks for the heads up, if I pick the game back up I'll be sure to keep that in mind
---
Oooh that gets me steamin. Especially when it drags out 20 minutes.
---
I had a harder time with the instruments, but I've seen others do it.  I think it's easier to glitch sideways into something and then build down as opposed to glitching down into the ground from the beginning, but try different things and see what works best.   Keep in mind that once you're in, underground, it's easier to create other glitch points.  For instance, at the 2 minute mark of my video, you see how a 4poster bed could be used, with the top of it sticking out of the ground.  But that had to be placed while I was already underground.
---
May I ask how it does 711 damage without being bloodied berserkers etc?
---
Fallout 1st has been this years biggest flop*
---
You can‚Äôt get the plans from novice mode.
---
Right, it's not the YouTubers fault that there's only been negative things to cover for months
---
It would be cool for sure. Make the whole score mean something. A good healthy way to be competitive WITHOUT pvp.
---
Some sorta sniper rifle. Sooo bored of using the same guns I been using since 2015...
---
I don't think any more of this mention of Wastelanders than the error listing the end of the Holiday Scorched event as Friday the 26th, when the 26th is Thursday. Little errors, redundancies, etc. happen all the time in web communications. There could be more to it than that, of course, but I see no particular reason to speculate about early releases based on some thin speculation... mainly because I have no interest in disappointing myself. ;)
---
That aside, I've never expected Wastelanders at the end of Q1. While possible, it seems far more likely that it will arrive (and was meant to arrive) in January some time. I had originally expected Wastelanders to show up in early November, so that's still giving them an extra 3 months to fine tune the update. If they delayed until the end of Q1 that would be something like 7 months of content drought, which would be *terrible*.
---
I had it for awhile and got rid of it for this reason. It wasn't really that great of a boost anyway.
---
That has nothing to do with the scenario though. It's a server issue at that point. I totally feel this though, stuff like this happens to me in game all the time.
---
I think the Enclave are scared of Zetans and that's why they abandoned the project
---
Atom shop?
---
*Free?*
---
What sort of loopy land have I entered
---
Casuals keep this game alive. We want the rewards.
---
I think both the hate and the love are justified.
---
It's a beautiful game with slick mechanics and an interesting environment.  But everything about it is a snack, there isn't a meal to be found.  If that makes any sense.
---
Ya, it's kind of a one hit wonder though. I have an instigating explosive black powder rifle that absolutely crushes......then you have to reload. Lol. Fun gun though.
---
i only got it because it looks cool
---
I'm not sure on that one. I know for the future tec globe, I built that when they made yhe mistake of letting everyone use it for free instesd of selling it, so they let everyone keep it who built it but you can't build more. So, everytime I've moved since then, it just goes back to my stash and I make sure not to delete it ever. Not sure if the dual smokes work the same of not. I wouldn't risk it, if it was me.
---
Right. Like if I get top score on your machine, it should stay there. Just like on Stranger Things. Lol
---
I think he meant more about just how *stable* it was. It's honestly quite embarrassing that a year after launch 76's stability still is shaky at best.
---
I think it‚Äôs my cards but I could be wrong mate, I don‚Äôt have the mods on here yet
---
If you open it you get put on the naughty list :p.
---
This is my point buddy. If true it would be actually a great homage from bethesda to fallout 2.
---
The improvements to private servers are a good additon, but I wonder why it is that a simple "Invite to Server" option wasn't considered.  It seems like being able to handpick friends to add to your server would be more practical than having to form a team beforehand, since a team is limited to 4 players.
---
Yeah, I found a 3 star, instigating, 50% damage resistance while aiming, and +10% damage while aiming for at someone's camp for 1500 caps. Hell of a deal
---
What mods are there for black powder rifles?
---
Has this kind of thing happened before? Hackers spawning unreleased items to get people banned? I'm a VERY casual player and I wouldn't want to get into any trouble, it was hard enough reaching lvl 50!
---
I think a big part of it is Bethesda. Some stuff is definitely worsened because of media. Unfortunately Bethesda has made a lot of mistakes with 76 and garnered a certain reputation. I have some faith Wastelanders will bring a major PR and player boost. I just really hope it launches mostly bug free and enjoyable and without some major hiccup that curtails the experience
---
This game needs a legit war on hackers and dupers.
---
Bethesda your silence is deafening on this topic. Be louder please.
---
Hope there is rare outfits like the halloween event! Need an elf suit! (like will ferrel in the movie elf)
---
That would be neat. I mean even if they were just basic blacked out screens until you play them would be cool to me.
---
Maybe you've played too much CoD, kid, but it's been pretty typical for free things to pop up in the Atomic Shop.
---
You do speak a lot of sense, I'll agree. Those little errors do pop up a bunch, just was one of those things that had me second guessing myself. Holiday 19 does seem like a stretch, but I def see it coming out Jan 2020 like you said. Beginning of Q1 makes much more sense than the end of Q1.
---
Do you have mutations that proc effects?
---
I know this is one of the tricks to pull people into PVP, if people start harassing me (which is VERY VERY rarely), I just pop a Rad-X which temporarily mutes my mutations so they can‚Äôt get the proc.
---
I believe you mean Robot Santa Claus.
---
Or figure out a way to use purified water to cook
---
Never had 1000 rounds
---
LOL...whoops :)
---
Thought it was a bug. They seem to be spawning in containers within the world as of today. I found two in suitcases. When I clicked on them, they make a noise as if collected but they disappear. They are nowhere to be found in my inventory.
---
Yes, but not at this scale. There are loads of unreleased items that have wormed their way in, but your odds of coming across them are microscopic. The christmas presents, however are much bigger than any of those cases, and have been mass duped on PC, and possibly on console.
---
If youre not on PC though, dont worry. If you are, just be careful. Any items that seems suspicious, check the wiki before picking it up to see if it should be there.
---
Possibly the Land of Damage Control!
---
Nuke mines. But it takes ages to kill someone with more than 1/4 of HP, and that's if they are stupid or AFK.
---
I mean fudge rounds.. üòÇ
---
It was probably a PSA for people that heard about Wastelanders this summer and didn't hear about it being delayed.
---
Thanks! :)
---
Yea I also thought it was a weird comment, I'm just not translating the weirdness into a good thing just yet, haha. 
---
Here's to hoping for a polished Wastelanders in the new year!
---
I guess im just frustrated with 76 bad TOW good. I was so hyped for TOW too and it missed the mark. Subpar ending, side quests, and i honestly didn't feel lije playing to be honest. To be fair. I have really been playing 76 much since i did most things i wanted to do
---
"Games won without firing a shot while crouched"
---
Reward: chickensuit
---
cool, i'll keep that in mind, i'll try it either later today or early tomorrow and i'll report my results
---
 Exactly. I go in there and murder every one personally. So much fun. ;)
---
You‚Äôre like me then.  RL luck of 1.
---
I have 2 friends that got really bored at all the other games they have. I convinced them to play this game and they both bought it. Me and my one friend have been very nice around the community (I once posted an uplifting story/question about what people‚Äôs favorite thing about 76 is, but I got downvoted to shreds) and my friend has been playing this game so much and (level 100 now) and has recently thanked me by giving me a sheepsquatch outfit and white spring jumpsuit. I can‚Äôt play the game that much due to my strict parents not letting me play during the week, and only a little during the weekend. Would really like it if I can have a legacy to help my character out.
---
Also since people are downvoting everyone because some people are greedy, I upvoted all the negatives I can find.
---
Try looking for a quad lever. That thing does work!! Much better in a rifleman build than a handmade or combat rifle imo.
---
I agree the executioner's adds little, but it is a weapon I like limb damage on.  At events like One Violent night I target legs to both tag and slow down the ghouls headed to the jukebox letting others finish them.
---
bayonet, thats it.
---
Thanks, not sure why I got downvotes
---
This
---
Yeah you always took damage from other players (unless pacifist), I dunno why you think we didn't.
---
The santatron only collects santatron stuff. No junk. Only people who own the collectron can set the santatron to collect junk
---
Does it use the flux that spoils or do you have to waste good flux for it
---
Agreed, I‚Äôm hoping that wastelanders is the other ‚Äúhalf‚Äù of the game that‚Äôs missing. I can‚Äôt enjoy any older fallouts anymore without the fluidity of real-time Vats
---
It's an auto
---
So, just a thought here, perhaps public test servers are close...with Wastelanders??
---
You don't know how pacifist works, do you?
---
Are you on PS4?
---
Yea, just had someone explain this to me. I picked up all of my mutations farming west tec way at the beginning, so I kept the splash damage mutations instead of re-rolling for the rest of my life or spending all my caps on serums. If I pick the game back up I'll be sure to respec all my mutations accordingly
---
sounds good though
---
Do you think a QE LA beats a TSE?
---
Santatron will only collect both if you own both.
---
I'm not sure about damage numbers but a quad lever is probably superior for mobbing since you get 20 shots before reloading.  I have a quad ffr that is awfully good on my stealth sniper.
---
You read like Eustace from Courage the Cowardly Dog. OOH GA BOOGA BOOGA
---
Santatron doesn't collect junk unless you own the paid collectron as well.
---
maybe I don't, enlighten me oh mastermind, as far as i understand if i have pacifist on, I cant damage anyone.
---
Damn. Imagine having a refined receiver, or a auto reloader, etc. 
---
People like us would be gods
---
Don‚Äôt even need to respec, rad-x just shuts them off temporarily.  You can keep doing what you‚Äôre doing.  If you‚Äôre like me since you in general want your mutations on, you never use your Rad-X, so you‚Äòd have a ton stock piled to keep taking them while they just waste their time.
---
Most Toys contain lead, screws or both.
---
Right, thanks a lot for the explanation, fellow vault dweller!
---
I know what the purpose of it is - however as you probably know *"the lore says"* the robots can bring it back at any time and they (BGS) have mentioned as much:
---

---
&gt;**Q: Speaking of Fasnacht Parade, is it ever coming back?**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;**Maria:** There‚Äôs a holotape in Helvetia that mentions that since the robots are now in charge, they can ignore the calendar and hold the festivities whenever they please.  
---
&gt;**Mark:** My Magic 8 Ball says, ‚ÄúOdds are good.‚Äù

---
&gt;We‚Äôve also retrofitted popular Seasonal Events, Fasnacht and Meat Week, with this functionality. So, if they occur again (hint!) they will benefit from the improvements.
---
I could have sworn there was another tease but I guess my memory has failed me.
---
Edit: Updated my original comment to reflect it's original intent.
---
You can't take damage anyway. Slap damage was removed many months ago.
---
The only thing pacifist does is stop *you* from damaging others. Not the other way around.
---
You stated in your previous comment that others can't damage you if you have pacifist on, which is false.
---
Sorry, but the circlejerking is in full swing again
---
For sure all your load times across the board will be much faster but as for the removal of server lag this will still plague you as will delays in crafting menus and the normal UI lag / Event lag.
---
if you are not open to getting robbed or fighting them turn pacifist off. Every time you look at the toggle that says "pacifist" think to yourself: Am I built for PvP? am I prepared to fight while squads of goons at any given moment ? Because that's what your signing up for. In the past I would go into events and cancel the event leaving pacifist turned off. A platter would accidently shoot me and I would be able to initiate PvP. Killing their entire team. looting and leaving. Sure I got killed someone's but I was prepared and had no junk on me. Never turn off pacifist unless your ready to fight at all times with anyone. If you do have pacifist off keep your doors locked and keep your vendor stored. If you get into an altercation with a player your giving them an easy bus ticket to come to your house and wreck everything and you.
---
Wait curious here how do you win without firing a shot would you be betting on 3 left and two downing eachother?
---
If you can't remove a wall for some reason due to it being a nightmare to rebuild, you can always change the wall into a door or window piece, del the offending item and then change the wall back.
---
Or they fall i guess?
---
ballistic damage. Or guns... it doesn't need any buff if your stacked in rifleman or commando. That player or enemy is dead.
---
the best is that dude that farm like half millon clicks everytime he talks about fallout 76 or bethesda 
---
but when his beloved director launch a shitty game he goes with "if you have patience and are open minded you can enjoy this game" well shit, if you did that with f76 you can probably enjoy too if you enjoy delivering boxes
---
never seen a bear arm before, is it armour?
---
I think the scorched should armed per their region. Ash heap Fire breathers equipment, Savage Divide Raider gear, Mire Free States and Boss, Bog BoS to include PA troops. It makes no sense that an unarmed jumpsuit wearing scorched is "dangerous" to me in Full Combat/Scout armor or PA.
---
I really wish they‚Äôd add these (along with additional holo-tape games).  I‚Äôd put a few Nuka-Tapper in my bar and sell refreshments like a small arcade.
---
QFFR sounds pretty deadly, now that you mention it. I‚Äôll have to look into that, thanks!
---
Scorchbeast is your best friend when you're hiding on the bottom of Grafton dam.
---
Yeah or usable nuka cola machines!!
---
You've never had a player die to the Scorchbeast or radiation? Also sometimes they don't make it to the circle suspiciously. Basically you just gotta be lucky
---
if you ever brewed before you would know you use propane ( gas) or wood. If your brewing on an industrial level you can use electricity but it had to be a perfectly sterile environment. Brewing or distilling requires flame. we brew extremely quick though. Brewing takes months- years. Die to the aging and process times. So if you want realism try it yourself. I brew at home a couple times a year with my wife. That stuff is not a quick process at all.
---
I highly approve of this idea i dont move my house or anything like ever but my buddies always complain about this and i would too it seems like it would be very irritating
---
Also any instigating lever will 1 shot 80 pct of the monsters in the game
---
Especially when you have a BUNCH in them. Ammo is the most tedious though.
---
absolutely.

I used to run a TSE Lever in my rifleman build before I got my BEVats.
---
The quad will make you much more effective in a mob situation than a TSE. 
---
Rifleman builds are about accuracy and one hit downs.  The TSE loses accuracy because of the second shot, so it gimps what the lever was designed for.  
---
The second TSE shot generally misses your target unless your right on top of it, which is not optimal for a rifleman build.
---
junk farm points are often taken so this colectron is like having a junk extractor anywhere you like (dunno if it's worse or better). But since it has a computer to make him search for scraps or junk i think in the future it could be more specific, i would love that he only search for 1 item like "lead"
---
Like one time i won cause scorthbeast. But thats it i dont think ive ever had anyone suspiciously die always had to fight for my wins üôÅ
---
Yup. Not sure why you can't get the to represent your faction. It would make a great, cheap atom shop item that people could get in one day. Price them at 100 atoms or something.
---
Didn't realize PVP was this closed off, thanks for the advice
---
The game is already so easy I run 6 points Commando, 3 points Tank killer (yes it works I definitely notice when it's not on) and 3 points Tenderizer, and 3 points Bloodymess. And I don't have any real bullet spongey issues except with Sheepsquatch
---
Because everyone is itching for Christmas. Maybe some Christmas music for the radio. I am sure some of the classics are not under copyright at this point. 
---
In addition some seasonal events would be nice as
---
 well! 
---
Or maybe a member of Bethesda will go around in a  notty Santa suit, and hands out gifts to all the good little girls and boys on the week leading up to Christmas, also make an event for pictures with Santa. 
---
I swear Santa,  I have been a really bad boy this year! 
---
All the possibilities, they are endless. 
---
I wish you, and everyone the best!
---
so slap damage is gone, so people cant hurt you in non-pvp, even if pacifist is off?
---
well thats news to me
---
Your really nice üôÉ
---
My pleasure. Stay safe out there!
---
Lol my team n i were never good at hiding. Heard shots off we ran lol free loot man
---
you can look up your tadpole currency in the stats tab (its not in items), the last option to the right lists all your currencies
---
If your on xbox I will make you any serums you want for free. People like this are scum sorry it happened to you but simply cure all your mutations and I will craft you any that you want.
---
GT: Dragonic One
---
Shoot me a msg I work a lot but am on most night around midnight EST.
---
Hmm. The game has always spawned me at the closest icon outside of the nuke zone.
---
No you're really nice
---
Bloodied primed hvy gunner to the face, still not getting rewards sometimes.
---
Bruh. Slap damage was removed shortly after launch, right around when they made CAMPs invulnerable.
---
then get head shots and die anyway.
---
They have vendors of plans n ammo so i believe it
---
Except candy is useless. I saved enough over three months for an epic and got a wood one star. Kewl.
---
i would love to join for raids since i play alone and can't do solo, i'm on pc with this name
---
(i have 1st so lag is not a problem)
---
Yeah, it make me so mad, I‚Äôm pretty low level (37) and I can‚Äôt really afford to have that kind of ammo loss. Bethesda really has to fix these kind of problems.
---
The exams are only part of the badges. You still have to do the rest of the things for each badge
---
For cook, there are like 8 recipes you have to cook to complete.
---
I completely forgot they gave you the classic collection since I already owned it on Steam :P
---
I use it as a really light weight piece of food I can eat to fast travel, so I don't mind it. Tired of eating spoiled food. Gotta take better care of myself :(
---
you don't have to hit them just hit near them
---
Yo if that was a play on my username I salute the fuck out of that lmao. And yeah it is but usually nothing with ana actual function
---
That would be a dream for me:
---
* Add new nuke recipes
---
* Turn the Nuka Cola plant into a workshop that produces whatever type you choose (at different rates).  
---
* Add a vending machine that you can stock.
---
You right, you right.
---
Yea but very few people knew about due to a small amount of news outlets online mentioning it there are literally millions of people who own the classic collection and dont even know it which is bit of a shame
---
This is excellent!
---
ah so it's bugged, because people sure as hell can damage my lowlevel mules, feel like im playing survival when playing those
---
Thanks but I'm on the first quest ( 4/4 tasks - revive an ally, pass 3 exams, clear kiddy corner and dolly sods.  I've done the first three but it's not registering that I passed the exams.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and never had troubles finding full matches
---
Bethesda absolutely has made mistakes, but its that media amplification effect that I have seen as doing the most damage.
---
I have my own criticisms for Bethesda, but I also stepped into this game absolutely knowing it was going to be a mess. What I didn't expect was the crazy amount of hate from people who were not even playing, just watching videos from youtubers about the game.
---
Wait, so if you blueprint your vending machines and move when you put the blueprint down everything you had in there and all the prices will still be the same separated and everything like they were before you moved?
---
I might have to give up the in game radio aswell. That might be one of the issues.
---
No I trully dont know, never been raped, I paided for the service.
---
Wastelanders will be the final chance to make or break the game's reputation, so releasing it early would be a death sentence. That said, if the leaks are correct, they were shooting for February but the money from FO1st and the newly hired man power was brining them ahead of schedule
---
Does the same apply to shotguns?
---
Thank you Bethesda!!!!!!!
---
i'd love to get my hands on one as well, however i'm on ps4
---
A *whole* 1,000 rounds?  
---
*laughs in prime mini-gun*
---
I believe I scrapped one of those but it wasn‚Äôt legendary or have any crazy mods. Shit, might be in my stash I‚Äôll have to check when I get home
---
So many pics of weiners and buttholes.
---
Well if you have the vending machine on the ground. You have to directly place something ON the vending machine it automatically blueprints it in the stored menu. It HAS to have something on it or you lose it all.
---
Your comments and opinions didn't fix anything.  Why does this player base think the sun rises and sets for them.  Your just a consumer playing a game.  Noone really cares how you feel.  Especially Bethesda. Gtfo the forums with this nonsense.
---
I try to get a decent weapon and some armor at the start and then stay underwater for as long as possible until the storm forces me out.
---
Excellent. This is the type of stuff I want.
---
I figured out the problem. It isn't with the game.... I am in a back room converted from a garage. With my old att account I had something called an airtie (basically a wired from the outside ethernet cable connected range extender, so it put the modem that's 35 ft away directly in my room.) Which is blocked by a cinderblocks wall and a mirror on the otherside lol!  Anyway I hooked up the ethernet to my old airtie and I'm getting 203mb instead of 60mb. Thanks for everyone's input.
---
I always kill assholes afking at vendors with nuke mines üòÇ if they drop junk i leave a "you have been insulted" note. Its hilarious
---
I‚Äôve been playing since the BETA with my fianc√©, but had to take an extended break due to IRL events (we got a new house, both of us have embarked on new careers, planning our wedding next year, etc etc.).  We both hopped back on a few months ago and we‚Äôve been building out teams since then.  My current camp is right next to the overseers camp with a ton of cheap aid items, a table full of free stuff that always manages to stay stocked because of this awesome community - and I‚Äôm sure my ‚Äútake a bag, leave a bag, you dick‚Äù sign helps too lol.  I also have free water and some #protip signs around my camp pointing out the free melons (they‚Äôre food AND water kids!) in case I‚Äôm not there to help them out.  I‚Äôve encountered and helped countless newbies, whether that‚Äôs full blown power leveling a level 5 through white springs after giving them all the XP boosting goodies, or just dropping a few stimpcks and radaways if they want to do their own thing.  Sometimes I‚Äôll hop into events if I see a low level struggling on their own just to make sure they‚Äôre not wasting their time and ammo.  Just the other day we managed to completely fill a private server with 3 lowbies (including the fianc√©s mother... :/) and the rest of us higher level players.  Within about 3 hours,  we managed to get her mom from level 2 to 10,  the other guys saw a pretty good jump too.  Helping out the newly minted vault dwellers is the real end game for me, that‚Äôs how we rebuild after all!
---
So before I move, if I take and put down one floor and then throw all four of the vendors fully loaded on top of that floor and then blueprint the floor and the four vending machines they will stay loaded?
---
Not sure if I‚Äôm getting exactly what you are saying or not
---
Was this just outside Whitesprings station?
---
In this game ? Naaah never bud
---
"Coming soon, for more atoms than you can earn in two months"
---
Pass....
---
Just saw this on your insta haaha
---
Lololololol ;)
---
well in my challenges Athlete and swimmer is a 6 point challenge, and cook being a 9 point..so unless im misunderstanding something, you're still missing some challenges in those
---
Aside from your condescending butt-hurt, your toxic trash opinion is entirely wrong and you should be the one to gtfo. You can thank us for you not having a 400lb stash and any player not be able to walk up and shoot your camp to pieces out of boredom.
---
When I move, I usually just find a spot and throw down my camp box...It blueprints some stuff for me and it doesn‚Äôt others... I find it Blueprints stuff that is tacked on top of each other or close together. But if it‚Äôll save me the time of having to reload and reprice my vendor, I‚Äôll do it
---
Please Bethesda consider this as it would be great for us working family folks like myself we need to make time for friends for family for Fallout and unfortunately work....
---
For sure. I bet especially trying to grind up as a low level.
---
The game wouldn't be where it is without the community's feedback, I agree. It's important though that the feedback is well thought out and in depth. A little bit of nicety in the feedback helps too, don't think all of those "game is shit, shut it down and issue refunds" posts did anything for it lol
---
And on top of the that, it takes them longer to land it seems
---
Should. Ive done it before.
---
üëéüèºüëéüèº
---
Yes fastnacht will return... just not by the end of the year. Nothing you shared shows it was supposed to come by EOY
---
It's not just passing 3 exams, it's earning 3 Tadpole Badges.  On the Map menu, look in the Challenges option, and then World (yes, it's not the most convenient place to put them).
---
lol okay player vending and vault raids were added through suggestions. Many quality of life adjustments as well. Even adding the newly added weapons to Purveyor drops was added from feedback
---
I could name something that‚Äôll hit harder than the bear, the the colonel  gutsy, they have perfect armor penetration
---
Oh my God, you just saved me 30 to 45 minutes every time I move. I move quite often, I find one of the more enjoyable aspects of the game given the bugginess. Weather for a resource or just for different scenery. I appreciate it
---
Siri doesn‚Äôt understand context obviously
---
Yea I've did the event and hadn't discovered the location yet
---
One would expect it to return yearly - It seemed to a fair few of us (or at least people I‚Äôve talked to / seen commenting) that it might come back twice within a year‚Äôs solar cycle. 
---
In the same way meat week came back more then once.
---
Way worse than an extractor, almost to the point of uselessness
---
Simple decals?  Yeah, those would be nice.
---
No one can enter your stash box but you. If you build water purifiers or resource extractors you can lock them to keep people from taking them. For crops anyone can take them but they grow back fast and it's not an issue really.
---
Yesssss
---
You lock your extractors when you can. But crops can be taken. Not sure what plundering is but nobody can take your stuff out of your stash box.
---
Like 32 for max storage trav pharm, hiker, bandolier,batterys included, ordnance express is what I got on mygeneral mule
---
Legendary Lary my weapons armor mule is 50, has a full set of trash armor with the 20% WWR perk and the armor WR  perk
---
Which console?
---
LOL yeah. Now when I see the quest pop up I make a mad dash back to my camp to make sure I have everything I need. I make it in time for the fight more often than not but it's frustrating when I don't. Maybe they should extend the timer just by another minute or two.
---
I‚Äôve been to this guy‚Äôs camp.  It‚Äôs set up just north of Flatwoods.  Really great camp and a really cool guy.  The interior looks fantastic, too.  There‚Äôs booths and a counter, even a restroom.  It‚Äôs about as good as any location built into the game.  Maybe better.
---
Um... Where is this free Santatron? Did I miss the free Collectron? Or is it coming the week of Christmas?
---
Wish they keep stuff so when I collected enough atoms, I can get it (e.g. rustic staircase). Now I have to wait until it comes back... Which is good because it might be in sale, but I was hoping to get it now ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Amazing analogy
---
*I can see my house from here!*
---
The update is next week, not exactly sure on what date the events start
---
I'm recently new to fo76 I started in October (pc) I sunk countless hours into 3 and NV on 360. I just wanted to say that the caliber of ppl I have meet like alot of the higher level characters have already been leading by example. They have inspired me to help others lower than myself or to just drop a gift if a camp is cool and the owners around. That said I would've been playing when it dropped but I'm a husband and a father now and couldn't justify buying a next gen console or the game but I could justify a new laptop for work dell g5. The fo76 community is not at all what I had in mind back when I used to play modern warfare in high school the community was disrespectful and rude bigoted even but all the folks I have encountered act like adults it's like the gaming community as a whole aged with me idk if it's just because fo attracts a certain type of person and is just special or what but I will say I'm scared of the future. Now I know it's just a game but it means alot to me and I will try to be a part of the solution and not the problem.
---
When people open "your" stashbox, they'll only see their own items, so no, noone can steal from those, and if you're adventuring, you can use another guys camp to store your stuff in "his" stash.
---
I hope that didnt confuse you too much, lol
---
Thanks... I'll be sure to keep an eye out for when it drops. üòâüëç
---
Also your camp can be nuked, but this isn‚Äôt a problem in the forest and is rarely an issue other than around Whitesprings and maybe the Top of the World
---
Your stash is private, so is the 1st junkbox.
---
Your crops can be harvested by anyone, unless you lock them inside your base somehow (various ways to do this)
---
Your resource extractors/water purifiers/Junk bot can be looted by anyone, unless you lock it.  There are 4 levels of locks you can use 0-3.
---
I honestly would wait till lvl 10 to start focusing on your camp.  The plans, exp and junk you get while getting there will become invaluable once you do start camp building.
---
If you want to jump in and start building right out of vault,  I would focus on getting your workbenches built, and a few water purifiers to get yourself started.
---
There isn't any plundering possible. Other players cannot attack your camp. You're able to lock everything except crops
---
How do you lock it?
---
Plundering is stealing but by force like Pirates or Vikings
---
It's a pvp game.  Your the one griefing.
---
Plunder:  the violent and dishonest acquisition of property.
---
I saw Grahm get tag teamed by the bears by the WS cabins, they beat his ass down, permanent leg damage animation.  
---
Yeah, I saved Grahm, fucking fear me.
---
Holy shi\*t!! What does nuking do? I imagine it destroys bloody everything?
---
Indeed i'd have done that - if my entire house wasn't built on the concrete foundation in question :D
---
We have a *disease* called Bloodworms, if that counts?
---
You know with blocker/serendipity/dodgy and wearing a hazmat suit the ghouls will only hit you for like 2 damage, right? I run bloodied unarmed build and ive never stood on the bus or anything to farm there. I just walk through there over encumbered because the hazmat suit removes my carry weight bonus.
---
No one can attack your CAMP itself unless you're not in Pacifist Mode or have engaged PvP in some way (like Workshops, or being part of a team where a member has engaged PvP with someone).
---
I need it anyways. Serums
---
You can also build  a doorway and walk thru it. Then change the doorway into a wall. Then you can put anything you want in a room nobody can unlock.
---
Depends on your console, but if you hover your cursor over it in the build menu, next to the "move" and "scrap" options there should be a "lock" option (on ps4 it's left trigger). You can set what level lock you want. Most people dont bother picking locked player owned stuff at all cuz if they succeed they get a wanted level.
---
You have to attack someone before they can destroy your camp, it's not pacifist in general. I'm out of pacifist most of the time and people still can't destroy my camp
---
If Bethesda didn‚Äôt care how we feel, this game would have been abandoned last December.  Without players, a game is nothing.
---
I am with you!
---
Christmas wasn't the only thing that came early after seeing this...
---
You can switch off the turn based combat in Tactics, that was always a challenge lol
---
I see this often when your camp is taking the location of one of their camps and they want you to leave the server. If Im asked nicely I usually will leave it to them but usually they either threaten of just try to unload/intimidate to which I simply put away/store my rad shower and purifiers and go about my buisness.
---
Go play COD lmao
---
Youre welcome! Safest method is to just make a floor separate from everything and then place your vendors on there. Then it should work that way.
---
Well, last year Insomniac Games gave the players of the *Marvel's Spider-Man* a free Sam Raimi's webbed costume. All we got at that time of the year was [this](http://beta.ems.ladbiblegroup.com/s3/content/a4a811f15c188e4e1a7cfb1d64de6bb5.png).
---
I'm glad to see Bethesda is not going to pull off another scam like that this year.
---
Yeah i went and put it low down so it didn't seem to matter. Really though its the ones i tried to put on my exposed concrete foundations that are the particular concern. 
---
A feature like that suggested would mean you could at least edit it out. 
---
Ironically when i warp into the world and my base is materializing the damn cats are often rendered before the concrete foundation so i can see them as a irritating reminder.
---
Hadn't thought about that, sadly they got both my fusion generator and my shower so I'll be sure to remember this if I ever hop back in
---
Yeah if you place em on a floor it also works. But depends on how you wanna. Cheap n eazy method
---
Weapon
---
Yes it will return annually... you said they promised it would come out twice in one year. That‚Äôs just not true.
---
Yeah, it was surprising they hadn't added events until Faschnact. Though they did make Fallouts 1,2, and Tactics free if you played F76 in 2018
---
No they are not the problem. The problem is that you guys cant kill her properly. If you guys are complaining that people get on top of V9 then drop the nuke to cover the entire area. Radaways drop off ghouls all the time. Stop dropping to fight outside the zone and fight in. Deter people from coming. But it sounds like you guys really need to rethink your setup. Takes my group between 2-5 minutes to take her down.
---
Or even have a nuka maker like in fo4!
---
I never said it's impossible, but in any event full health is great in the vault.
---
Thanks for the tag, but I'm up on a roof right now. An actual roof irl lol
---
Hahahaha!! Oh nice
---
I just like to collect clothes in general lol
---
Pretty much. Like I said, not a problem in the forest and rarely a problem elsewhere. If you see Death from Above trigger you can check, but I‚Äôve never come close to being nuked myself. Build around the Whitesprings and it might happen, but otherwise it‚Äôs rare.
---
What? No. It's not bugged. You can't take damage outside of PvP, period.
---
Yeah Im on xbox.. Im anxious for wastelanders additions.
---
You didn't change the stash size or do anything to fix the game.  All you do is run your mouth on reddit. Your self-centered opinions are not as important as you believe.
---
Totally agree. I call him a mad man for even attempting to run a raid as bloodied.
---
Cries in handmade
---
On the one hand, it IS nice that Bethesda is giving away a free Santatron.. that basically does the same thing as a Collectron, but additionally collects candy. On the other hand, it's kind of a d\*\*k move because it basically negates the purpose of a having a Collectron... you know, that thing that we actually spent Atom on... a junk collecting robot that does, well, less than the Santatron.
---
I'm all for freebies, but if Bethesda is planning to release stuff for free that's nearly identical to a "for pay" item, it should announce this at the time when it releases that "for pay" item and give us the choice to purchase now or wait for the freebie.
---
Freebies are nice, but they aren't quite so nice when they take an existing paid item, modify it a little, add a new feature or two and release it for free.
---
Now, if this freebie were of a "timed" ownership, such that you could only own and use it for a limited period of time before it disappears from your inventory, then I'd be more okay with this. That means the Collectron will have continued value after that freebie disappears. But, the fact that some of us spent 700 for a Collectron when we could have waited to get this version for free, yeah that kind of chaps me just a little.
---
He doesn't give out the same loot as a Collectron unless you already own the Collectron
---
So what are you doing right now exactly? ü§£
---
I just wish there were packs of deathclaws. The only place that has multiple as far as I know is the Abandoned Waste Dump.
---
We need some harder hordes.
---
Lol seriously, I‚Äôm tired of people shitting on 76 while handling Death Stranding with baby gloves üòÇ
---
Nay our setup is fine.
---
You may like fighting in rads, but we dont.
---
The problem is assholes who think they know what they are doing, and fucking up the landing.
---
Once she lands, she doenst take off.  We have a few bloodied melee builds in our crew that drop her in moments.  If she lands.  Getting her to land because of randospam is the problem, has always been the problem and will continue to be a problem because people dont want to learn, they just want free loot.
---
Its a mechanics based fight not a T&amp;S, you cant treat it like a T&amp;S.  And when people dont know the mechanics, its a waste of a nuke.
---
By chance do you care to share how you get her to land when there are 10 people shooting at her in the air?  That would be invaluable information instead of your normal "you guys suck get better" attitude.  Because I guarantee my crew has dropped more queens than yours
---
 Way too many perks for me. Its not like I have choices. ;) They don't hit me a lot. My knives are all +40% speed and are into the 300s pretty quickly as everything procs, so anything I touch dies.
---
 Its mostly rads, I have Radshield hotkeyed, and my BoS Heavy Combat is all I need, to survive easily. As I have Healing Factor I don't even do anything about my minor damage, just move on to the rest of the golf course. ;) I sell Stimpacks a lot.
---
run standard in a group.  Problem solved.  eventually if you have a steady enough group you will be able to take on expert and win, and you will fee a sense of accomplishment and pride in the achievement.    
---
As opposed to having it handed to you by removing the timers or otherwise dumbing it down.
---
If you‚Äôre looking to casually dip into a variety of weapons, or use rifles as a back up on a melee character, take one rank of each card.  If you want to use semi auto rifles as your primary weapon system, I‚Äôd definitely suggest maxing out all three cards, and also investing in stealth.
---
I personally put all my chips into stealth and rifleman perks on my main character.  He‚Äôs definitely not the top DPS build available, but soloing SBQ is by far the easiest with that character.  He‚Äôs super efficient.  Aside from a bloody gauntlet build, I think a bloody stealth sniper is the only other character capable of killing a regular scorchbeast in one hit.
---
i've brewed plenty of times(never with wood), haven't in awhile b/c yes it really is a affair even with a good wort chiller, but this is a video game with a "fermentor" that is slightly nonsensical contraption
---
One of them should run.... Doom!
---
I'm 100% serious too, it could, it should, and Bethesda totally can! 
---
DO IT.... DO IT.... DO ITTTTT!
---
&gt;He doesn't give out the same loot as a Collectron unless you already own the Collectron
---
We only know this from the release notes. How it will actually function is as yet unknown as the item hasn't been released. It's possible that it may **not** be tied to the Collectron as has been stated and may allow anyone to collect Junk and Candy without owning a Collectron. They don't call this company Bugthesda for nothing.
---
I really missed out when I didn‚Äôt get that flooring.  I was like ‚Äúit‚Äôll be available again‚Äù, but it‚Äôs the one thing that doesn‚Äôt keep returning to the shop.  LOL.
---
Nothing can be stolen from your camps
---
anything else is a disappointment IMO
---
Im always willing to roll the dice when i see a punchbowl
---
I seem to have also missed that.
---
Meltdown sucks. Just a fetch mission. The other two, not so bad. Expert is insane on both if laggy
---
Ooh. Or a fallout clone of doom using the centaur from 3 or NV. And use all the new mobs as well.
---
Me too. I really want the beer keg. How is it obtained?
---
No one has said what you CAN loose. That is junk. At any point, if you die, you loose all junk you are carrying. It will fall in a paper bag, but sometimes the bag falls in a hole, the server disconnects, or others take your bag. 
---
The only place another player can kill you (if you have pacifist on) is in a workshop. But enemies can kill you anywhere making your drop available to anyone to pick up.
---
but thanks for letting me know how much vault steel i need
---
You act like if 'fun' wasn't a subjective thing.
---
Yeah. I collect clothes though so :p
---
Or MAYBE- the mega top secret and hush hush contents of Vault 79 are in fact a secret space shuttle, with which the Enclave intend to launch themselves into space? That could explain why the Secret Service arrive; not only to investigate why the Whitespring dropped off the radar, but to secure the shuttle and prepare Appalachia for the incoming exodus of Enclave as they prepare to leave the planet.
---
Our end goal in Wastelanders might be to sabotage or destroy the shuttle, preventing them from leaving, explaining why the Enclave gave up their plans of colonizing another world.
---
I‚Äôve got a hard time scrapping them away as well
---
That‚Äôs a lot of load to put on the engine and server when you have 24 players
---
If I actually still have it, it‚Äôs yours, if you‚Äôre on Xbox
---
Everytime I get into PVP it does. I dont bother anymore. No skill kills reign right now.
---
Oh good thought - I‚Äôll try that tonight
---
Everyone who does pvp is this basically or worse god mode explosive laser legacy
---
Laughs in 50 cal hunting rifle
---
Or there‚Äôs some new content tied to the presidential suite in the bunker.
---
Congrats man!! But... Is it Bloodied Explosive? :D
---
According to an employee comment, you can only build 1 of these "collectors" in your camp. If you want a Santatron roaming and collecting, your Collectron must be scrapped. It's a one-at-a-time thing, apparently. This may also be why they're doubling down on Santatron so that it in addition to all of Santatron's freebies (i.e., candy), it can also collect what the Collectron collects. Of course, if I had to make a guess, it will collect Junk, Scrap or Candy mutually exclusive. Because it's a one-at-a-time thing, you can't have Santatron roaming for Candy separately from the Collectron roaming for junk. Yeah, that's no bueno.
---
Let's also keep in mind that the only candy in Fallout 76 is pretty much Gumdrops, Bubblegum and Cotton Candy Bites... which is far less useful than collecting Scrap or Junk. This is particularly true for those of us who still have hundreds of pieces of candy that we collected during the Halloween event. Now, if they're also planning on adding some new seasonal candy, such as Candy Canes, Peanut Brittle, Peppermint Bark or even Fruit Cake Bites that only Santatron can find, then that might make Santatron a bit more useful.

Is there a reason the tesla does so much damage now?
---
Yup its either teslas or vats either way the pvp in this game isnt skill based. Better off playing NW
---
So know more creative PvP builds anymore
---
more and more it does.  I usually will go on mic and just tell them "hey I'll not use stealthboy tesla if you don't" and if they get with the program cool, if not I'll go a round or 2 and then bounce cause I find that type of pvp uninspiring.  
---
That said stealthboys are the only legit counter to vats so it would take a major overhaul of pvp in general to really fix all that.
---
Thats true its pretty safe on xbox atleast
---
Right I made that comment before Valseek shared that detail
---
Most people Ive played with their kit is only OP DR, not ER. I run like 450 ER, so it doesnt do much to me. They might also run full auto.  Damage cap at 110 means only auto for PVP encounters.
---
Yeah, I remember this guy in PA came into my house just smashing shit, he ran outside and kept breaking things like Junk extractor and that so I attacked him, thats when his stealthboy'd sniper teammate started killing me and my friend I was teamed with.
---
Theres always going to be some weird loophole to force PvP but at least it's not as ridiculous as it used to be.
---
There is a protected zone that cannot be targeted by nukes. See the map here: [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Blast\_zone](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Blast_zone)
---
The wiki's info for Fallout 76 isn't complete, but it does have a ton of good stuff.
---
This wasn't me, but I do this every so often as well. 
---
Escort duty is a lot of fun.   It takes us high levels to places that we haven't visited in a while and, if it's a lower level area, gives us a chance to break out some fun low damage legendaries.   For me, it's a silenced 10mm pistol....
---
hey did you figure out what was wrong ?? I can't seen the number aswell,,, 
---
I have 2 mods,, better inventor and perk manager
---
Are you using those mods ?
---
No one can take anything out of your stash in but anyone can access their stash through your stash box, and vice versa.
---
Lol no actually i didnt even do that, i just collected fluxes haha
---
Surprised people are still upset that people play this game
---
Neither do I so long as they give no advantage. I'm just wondering if the devs even care any more, given their lack of reaction.
---
Agreed I abouted escape artist to counter vats works wonders
---
Max out slugger perks.  You‚Äôll need all the damage you can get, even with an instigating weapon.  You can lose the fluff perks like Can Do, Travel Agent and weight reduction.  I always have more food, healing items and water than I can ever use.  Fusion cores are also really common.  I keep 10 and toss the rest.  Also, you‚Äôll have nothing to spend your caps on after a while.
---
If i see someone called karren walking around CAMPs complaining i will literally scream
---
Have bought well over 200 2-star weapons from the purveyor, never once got a god-roll item...
---
Yes I have been working on taking multiple workshops at once. I have Fallout 1st so I just use the private play and take multiples and spend some time gathering stuff and such.
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Who doesn‚Äôt?!  LOL
---
Yes, I'm using them. They're more important than seeing the damage #s, but I wish I could see them anyway...
---
Agreed. The terminal is way underused.
---
Its a great theory, and works when you dont have randoms shooting her in the air. 
---
I suspect you run with your crew on private servers?
---
It was cool to keep track of the missing persons missions. But does it actually do anything else yet?
---
Well not an item. But there was a little know changer to hunter vs hunted. Where they gave 3 people the pilgram out fit n 1 person the turkey outfit and there was a turkey hunt kind of thing. Pretty cool
---
Also, I'm totally joking
---
online games had zones capable of handling 100's of players at a time 20 years ago, yet here we are barely able to handle 24 at times.
---
Fuck yeah . was thinking the same id love to open an arcade. Maybe a working pool table ... Slot machines? Go go bar?
---
ha ha fucking ha ha.
---
Thank you ! What would you recommend trading out for more slugger perks then ?
---
Also I have far too many cores, atm I'm just trying to get x01 mods from Modus
---
You‚Äôll probably be banned now
---
I try not to use my telsa in pvp, my go to for assholes is bloody railway rifle.
---
that isnt very good..
---
some aspects of it are ok.. but on the whole.. nah, you can do a much better shotgun build than that
---
What a pleasant surprise. Return of the Halloween Nuclear Winter rewards for those who missed them (maybe I'll finally try out that mode), free 'Santatron', a fun-sounding Christmas event, and an answer to the requested choosable NW maps and much-needed properly private servers? Nothing to complain about here, other than it seems like I'll need to do a deep clean of my stash to prepare. I didn't get to play during the last double XP event either, so I'm pleased that there's another one so soon!
---
Unsurprising that the free trial will be corresponding with the holiday event for a bit. Those few days in Appalachia will be very hectic... but certainly interesting.
---
Shouldn't the weapon be Bloodied as well to get that kind of damage? :)
---
This is the problem with PC gaming.  And has been since the Mid 90s when online gaming got its foothold.   Everyone remember the Archmages Staff of the Apocolypse in Diabo?    Same thing is happeneing in fallout.  Tools will be designed to cheat, they will be distributed, and used.
---
There is a very strong crowd of "hackers" who datamine and browse code to find out how they can get around the rules.   This is a problem on every PC game on the market.  People will find a way to cheat, and hide it.
---
This is not something that can ever be controled on PC due to the massive differences in hardware and software running on said devices.   Consoles are much easier to control because everyone is using the same software and  hardware as the next guy, so it is less likely to find that backdoor into the code.
---
You cant stop a linux system from circumventing security protocols.
---
Yeah I run low health PA all the time. Put emergency protocols on your torso and you'll be good to go
---
Yes.
---
That's a fun one
---
Oh duh @ me. I changed it and then decided to do shotguns and never changed it back. Silly me. Thanks for pointing that out!
