Seriously it would be nice to be able to do something with duplicate plans
---
---
---
Ok, thank you for understanding, can we trade tomorrow?
---
Straight jacket, clown suit n hat, prisoner collar, all gas masks, ritual mask, raider and trapper armor sets
---
That’s very interesting I would like more info
---
Mine's more for roleplay reasons but I built my camp with a public are and private area. I have a workshop open to the public with signs pointing the way then a little cabin for myself next to it which I have locked. No real reason for it just makes sense in my mind
---
That’s generous 
---
I'm imagining a duper giving a horde of super mutants Tse shotguns and then kiting them to a populated area. Bastards would probably kill themselves. 
---
I replaced it with TS level 30 revolver but yeah, that gun is great.
---
They don't have the budget for that.
---
I completely agree with you. I was moseying about in Watoga and was killing some pretty decently leveled Scorched. (Decently leveled for me lol) and a lvl 85 player invited me to trade, for some reason other games have made me very leery of player v player interaction so I kind of just bAcked off. Well he didn’t like this, he followed me and dropped me a full set of lvl 50 armor. 2 melee weapons and 5 Stimpaks. What a guy. It was honestly one of the coolest interactions I’ve had on a game to date. This is a great community. 
---
Or we just play the game we want to instead of jumping servers and farming stuff. It is not a priority for my character. If I ever get marsupial it will be by accident and I will probably drink radaway. But, you do you man. I'm probably just jealous or lazy or something.
---
Sadly xbox 1, but I will dedicate my server jumps to harpers!  Thanks for the input!
---
My set up is the drifter outfit, gas mask with goggles, and the leather officer cap. Looks super badass. Would love to get my hands on the hunters long coat but obvi is really difficult to get. Wish me luck!
---
I got ya. Hordes confuse me. I always show up and then the event ends. 
---
I replaced it with TS level 30 revolver but yeah, that gun is great
---
Oh my god, that's...beautiful...
---
I’ll be on my in 20 and good to go
---
That's really helpful. The one I've been looking at puts the whole divide into one category. Thanks!
---
I'd settle for being able to get the rain coat from American Psycho to wear for when I go around chopping everyone up with my axe. 
---
Level 38 so far, been playing for a couple weeks and have had many, many encounters with other PCs. Only one of those were hostile. Love this community.
---
PSA
---

---
Get explosives expert perk card and whatever card relates to the gun that’s explosive.
---
You can literally double or more your damage 
---
Where is the damn face palm emoji
---
Yes! I will with the rifleman and demo expert perks I have equipped. Give me about 20mins to get home. Xbox also btw
---
 Definitely agreed. I’d add on top of that that unlike fallout 4, the majority of enemies that you meet are going to be melee enemies.  Robots are only used in very specific locations, scorched don’t really post much for threat with their guns, so it’s only super mutants that are dangerous at range.  The majority of enemies will try to bum rush you and kill you, be they ghouls or monsters.  This further restrict your play style availability to only ones that are effective in those situations. 
---
they don't crash entire servers, just people in the general vicinity. sometimes not even that.
---
&gt;economy
---
there's no fucking economy. this isn't a mmo.
---
Max level, yeah. 800 caps? Can mod it up too, if you like.
---
I’m similar except I’m the one who is going to be playing FO76 while HE is the one who is going to be playing phone and switch games. 
---
The block function doesn't work if someone is invested enough to join after you leave a server. 
---
I’m Using PS4. My issue is that I have a Water purifier that’s stuck in my storage. It has a not allowed symbol on it. I can’t erase it nor place it. It’s taking up 4% of my storage. Storage space I really want.
---
I don't know?
---
Please just destroy it instead of giving it away.
---
Gotcha bro inv me when you’re ready I’m just  chilling 
---
I’ve never heard that? My budget has been full for multiple consecutive level ups
---
Ok I need to ask wat is anyone bothering with ammunition factory after is was nerfed. You can literally make thousands of rounds in the same time frame as the 100 get from the factory by doing a steel run and going through lucky hole mine in excavator armor
---
Nice. Send the stats and I’ll Venmo ASAP.  We should either text or private convo. I think real currency is against the rules. 5858134944 text if you want. 
---
These are the reason I wanna scrap legendaries. 
---
I wear the same outfit! Black glasses too. 
---
Maybe in fallout 7?
---
$10 on PayPal pffffffff
---
HAHAHAHAHA 
---
Don’t engage in PvP (turn pacifist on) if you don’t want to ‘be bullied’
---
If he’s ignoring you he can’t see you either 
---
Do you have mic and who is running the nuke 
---
So, it's going to be a dull boring party then if at least 3 people don't get killed, Dothroki-style......
---
Get ready for the patch the next week or so fixing it :c I also had that gun it was fun.
---
Maybe using nuka cola quantum
---
I think that stopped being a sound argument after retailers consistently  kept putting it on sale after black friday
---
Sure! I'll probably be on from ~10am-2pm Pacific. Possibly later in the evening as well. Just send my an XBL message or reddit PM when you're free.
---
Can agree 1000% that we need better legendary modifiers and reordering of modifiers, but also explosive as is way to powerful it needs a change big time.
---
Love the instigating change you mentioned as well.
---
Hopefully we get something like this in the near future.
---
Im soooooo ready, im no grifer tho i jus wanna have fun. I shoot most players i meet n usually imthsts the end as they dint shw any interest in fighting 99% of the time
---
It will be based on the level of the enemy killed. So yes, this means you can farm level 50 gear at level 2, if you wanted to.
---
Ok, thank you
---
just got a two shot black powder rifle, does 600 base damage its level 15 as well, so if anyone wants to one shot everything from low level hit me up for trade or to buy it.
---
Oh I thought you were doing it 
---
🎶Wouldn't it be nice🎵
---
I know! I don't take the pvp too seriously (I'm the type of person who would strip down to their underwear in game and challenge you to a battle of fisticuffs), so it was interesting to see these two guys go at me so aggressively both in and out of game with the messages. I'm sure I will encounter some good sports sometime! 
---
Yep, I would have done the same. Enjoy the caps and thanks for taking care of the sign over my head type of deal.
---
Nah, it's a cut up propane tank. You can see the valve and such up close. 
---
Ahahahaha 
---
Uhh
---
And yet 76 is losing players, banning players and of course being sold at 25 bucks. You're so far in denial you lapped Cairo twice! 🤣
---
Could you just not see them on the map? 
---
Also, pretty sure the constant health was just stimpack spamming, i believe there are perks that make them heal faster. 
---
Rock on! 😎🤘
---
You know that's never gonna happen
---
I havent noticed an increase, currently level 95 and have had the same camp, in the same spot, for at least 10 levels. Budget bar hasnt changed.
---
Yeah but it gets the immediate revengers off your back. Granted, someone will come after you no matter what server you're on, but you have a fighting chance of saving your loot at least.
---
The backdoor so I only have to close the electric roller door at the front to lock the camp down.
---
Lol furious doesn't even increase damage, it's absolutely terrible, or if it does it's a meaningless boost.
---
CoD is peer to peer. They don't run on severs. Hence why so many people have conn issues, lag and issues with shots not counting. And the "server they have is just a waypoint to check your account and etc. They don't host matches and still don't.
---
I'm past 200 hours now, just played 5 hours today with no dcs or crashes.
---
I got a feeling my internet is a part of the puzzle and probably the main issue with the game.
---
Stable wired connection with a live ip address and I'm regionally near my isps fibre optic backbone.
---
I may prefer the Enclave due to the neat uniform and the bunkers a pretty nice place with the crafting tables and all the different type of vendors.
---
I’m level 190+. Double yours.
---
I can knock out a few per day.  But it takes several days to buy even the cheapest atom shop items.  Because the base challenges aren’t repeatable.
---
Some of them have absurd requirements.
---
/7600 hours exploring the wasteland is an example. 
---
I managed to get it to work for about 40 minutes and it disconnected again.  :( 
---
New players wanted to claim a workshop and get ammo. And I wasn't going to provide the supplies to make them ammo. No one owned it when they arrived so they grabbed it. 
---
They carry a box with birds in it to tell them when enemies are nearby.
---
They can be bought at responder vendors. Not rare, but definitely useful for leveling up until you farm legendary armor or switch to pa.
---
Yeah but watching 20 players fight for their lives against a hordes of mobs while you sit in the middle and snipe the Scorchbeast Queen is one of the most priceless moments I’ve had in this game haha. 
---
Hey man, I don’t think this is going to happen the codes just reset
---
Predator g9-591 Laptop
---
After I open any sort of in game Menu (cooking, crafting etc) Tab and LShift no longer work correctly.
---
Tab doesn't work at all, both to open the Pipboy, or to use as the Back command in menus, and LShift only works if I double tap it.
---
I have this installed on my PC and I don't get these issues, this is only on my laptop.
---
I can rebind these to other keys, but if I put the Pipboy on anything other than the tilde, once I've opened it I can only close it by pressing ESC. 
---
Bethesda bragged about making singleplayer games to make fun of EA.
---
Bethesda made a multiplayer game that is somehow worse than anything EA has released.
---
What do you not get you dense fanboy?
---
Yeah it would be nice to put photos we take on the wall. Even if it were only one or two. 
---
Door, cuz people lock doors in their home
---
Not a quest as such, but collect treasure maps until l50.
---
Just because their original implementation was already done badly, doesn't mean it makes other ideas less valid. This more highlights an existing problem than condemns the higher population idea.
---
Nope. Are you hopping after getting one? 
---
There's a cooldown. Also diluted radaway reduces mutation chance by 50%.
---
*raises entire self into the air* time to complete as many quests as possible
---
Yeah man I totally feel you, I bought it again on ps4 to play with my gf and players are just so annoying there. I've been attacked so many times, my base attacked, people sending you messages after harassing.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
In my time on PC i've never once been attacked and every interaction has been pleasant, but there's so people obsessed with ruining your time on console.
---
What do I do when shes flying well out of range tho?
---
And wouldn't it be nice if the cuckoo click actually cuckooed 
---
I’m not questioning your good intentions, I’m questioning the community as a whole.
---
It does not.
---
There was a thread on here awhile ago that used stored % you show there is no change in budget 
---
R/gatekeeping
---
Amazing just what I was looking for. With all that, can you hit flying SBs?
---
I loaded into a server earlier, as I was still staring at the helpful tips screen I heard that little horror-style musical sting that plays as a nuke is landing.
---
"Fuck sake" I said out loud.
---
Eventually the world came into view and I was granted the sight of my dead corpse being boiled inside my power armor...
---
Fantastic!
---
Normally, you can't clearly see the weapon they are using. This game clearly shows that I'm getting hit with a hatchet by a Scorched, not a switchblade. If they want to randomize it still, maybe it the same class? Two handed melee weapons generate two handed melee weapons.
---
I think you just broke a record. Over 600 Tons
---
I am a fire breathing mistress of mystery ... don't need those other factions.
---
Yea it's been there since the beta, you've come across the damage bug where no what you do, whatever y I Ur fighting either be a npc, player, enemy.  Nothing can kill it. That's pretty much how the God mode bug started when the game launched and people reported having God mode and could never die. Closing the app. Restarting their console did nothing.
---
Well bugthesda, they know about the problem but I've have never seen any fixes/patches on it like so many other minor or game breaking glitches/exploits. 
---
I had to build mine as a row of 3 and a row of 4. Made me realise rectangular builds were boring and i need to make them different shapes.
---
Thanks I didn’t know about the cool down, I use to have the marsupial I lost it on accident trying to get it back.
---
Lvl 15?
---
If you're on ps4 i was going to offer 500 caps as I'm leveling an alt.
---
Your offers are in la la land. No one wants suchlow level stuff
---
Oh yeaaaaaah fuck
---
Similar, but with Mining hat for the better light.  
---
If she if still in the event zone, that’s fine you just need hit markers. The shotgun
---
Is tool for melee not the dps. As for her flying outside the event zone, that is an event bug. Another nuke would  need to be fired after the timer expires 
---
[removed]
---
This is by far the best answer.
---
Same to me. 
---
Maxed out. Scrapped two lamp. Wanted to build those lamps later again: I’m not allowed since budget is at max :-(
---
I don’t believe there is a limit, but you can’t choose what mutation you remove.
---
Yeah but I did only just start playing this last Friday. 
---
His do you ensure you get back on the same server where you dropped it?
---
Oh no you killed Gordon Freeman victim #1, how will we ever get Half-Life 3 now?
---
Nobody is saying you can't own a gun... Nobody is saying you cant carry a gun... all we are saying is you cant carry a gun in town!
---
WHY ARE PEOPLE LIKE THIS
---
I've also heard that "upgrading turrets can decrease your budget use". Any idea what that means?
---
Tfw though it doesn't show up as an option that terminal is lockable
---
I've always just scrapped and stored stuff with wires. I have a fully maxed camp and noticed recently I had a sliver of budget again. I wonder now if it was wired randomly clearing from the budget
---
&gt;At no point was it stated that he was in a team. Making your point invalid.
---
&gt;
---
Okay..
---
&gt; It's a bug, it's happened to me. If you can't accept that, good for you.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; It happened when in a group with friends. I had pacifist mode on, he had some kinda 3 star explosive legendary I died in 1 hit.
---
&gt; There's nothing else I can add.
---
I guess you can't read.
---
Not sure how this happens. I tend to not log off in the two areas I have ever seen nuked. The bog and white spring.
---
Thanks for the alcapsing, but did you fail to notice how I said I'd screenshot to show it working in a different post, I spent 30 minutes working at it so it wouldn't be floating 10 inches off the doorframe (exagerated, yes, but you get the point)  I have gotten it to work, at my camp, and have multiple friends who've been there and were the ones that pointed the gap out to me in the first place causing me to spaz out cause it fucked with my ocd since it wasn't 'plumb'
---
So far Ive been able to cope without it for almost 70 levels, but I am considering building an X01 suit now that I have the plans - just need to find the jet pack mod
---
It often turns to meat piles at the position it died, not where the ragdoll came to rest, which can get confusing.
---
Explorer's outfit, ushanka hat, black rim glasses. Nerdy explorer~
---
third best armor ... the top will surprise you
---
PvP is good especially if you find someone playing with their mule character
---
Ima be there
---
That's odd. Have you considered submitting a bug report?
---
Everything except my crops because crops.
---
3x3 block foundation with centre block missing and replaced by two water purifiers.
---
If I had a power armour station I’d need to upgrade to a fusion generator.
---
Not really, it doesn't show up as an option to lock it at least not on ps4. 
---
I would be so nervous hacking a terminal in that place - it takes me forever.  Locks are not as bad though
---
I need confirmation on this. 
---
Either they cant join you if you leave world - or its another thing Bethesda needs to fix.  It is intended to block players and prevent stalking. i wouldnt be suprised if doesnt work right. Add it to the list! Top priority!
---
The pve community has to shutup about pvp. Your post is idiotic. The people you complain about were just playing the game. 
---
I want to be able to sit on my rocking chair on my porch and fire at people who get on my lawn
---
Those tile floors are just wonderful, I wish I hadn't missed them.
---
No.
---
I want to hear "I sell Propane and Propane Accesories." 
---
Thank you! I always noticed that spot being bombed but didn’t know what it was 
---
YES
---
You can connect to basements with different elevations and even place concrete stairs INSIDE the lower foundation connected to the upper one. 
---
- place a foundation
---
- place the short beam on it
---
- connect another foundation next to the beam 
---
- place more foundations at both heights
---
- place optional a concrete stair on one
---
- use full and half walls
---
It’s basically to build a base with different foundation levels but snapped and connected 
---
Sometimes I wonder if Bethesda even knows or understands how their plans drop or spawn at the vendors for players. I've run into the rare-spawn vendor bot a few times now and both times he's had apparel items that are super common and can be found in abundance throughout Appalachia. What's the point of having a rare-spawn vendor if all it carries is common items? \*smh\*
---
Its there often if you go back a couple times, brick at Harper's ferry
---
I read somewhere it depends who kills it or it only can be killed so many times.
---
Not 100% sure but he is definitely gone.
---
Sigfast is right. All you really need is sentinel on all pieces and chamelon. Pretty bullshit though that power armor is trash in pvp. 
---
PvP is still 100% garbage though.
---
Try fullscreen
---
You certainly can. I have no idea how much damage the shotgun is doing at that far a range, but you can see the pellets explode on the beasts. Then sometimes the beast takes a little bit of damage, other times it takes significant (like 40% health) damage. I think one of its limbs is accidentally missing explosion resistance or something. 
---
The explosive ammo has its own unique range separate from the gun, and in the shotguns case its definitely longer. 
---
I have 18 I don't think there is a limit 
---
Good additions!
---
Absolutely. She is alive it why can she blame you for setting the world on fire...
---
You are right. Pretty much all of the problems I had on day one are still in the game. Shit I’m not sure if  they even know how to fix the duping issue. The only fixes I have seen are the ability to pick servers for camp placement and additional storage. I’m still getting daily crashes and enemy health bugs which are the two most annoying bugs among a host of others. 
---
Sometimes It feels like it's shared. Saw some glowing blood dissappear from Bloated Glowing Ghouls at the Whitesprings Golfcourse.
---
Do you have a picture?
---
Maybe they are realizing less dollars is better than no dollars ? 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Another thing, I got to atom challenges done today I felt like should have been completed awhile back. Did they finally start fixing the ones that weren't progressing? 
---
The store is fully loaded an automated.
---
Everything has been datamined so they aren't adding more or working on it atm
---
Alright, so I have tested Luck of the Draw and Weapon Artisan together and while it still shows that Luck of the Draw is proccing, it still doesn't increase the bonus durability bar (white bar) at all.  Looks like Luck of the Draw is a dud for these.
---
Yea then u gotta block them, although, they may have a friend who can see you but you dont know who it is. Just hop. Pvp system is ridicilous in fo76 anyway
---
I’ve noticed that if two enemies die at the same time and one is legendary sometimes the game will load the non-legendary loot as if it was the legendary and vice versa so check other mobs killed
---
No. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aax7wa/we_never_left_vault_76/
---
check out the picture.
---
I posted this exactly the other day and just got comments like "craft slower" or "It doesn't lag me".
---
But yeah, it just needs a craft 5+ all at once feature, just as we get when scrapping
---
uh, lol?
---
...a clever sting operation
---
Although, mine is just a t-shirt... I need to find this jacket you speak of. I got the BoS engineer outfit last night though... Loving that
---
It lights up and turns as well. 
---
Could be worse they could just jump in front of you, making you kill yourself with you TSE shotgun, over and over again 
---
oh Shotgun is not a dps weapon? i wanted to do shotgunner mainly
---
 Even in FO4 I found semis better conserves ammo and higher per shot damage.  With a mouse at least I can click pretty fast.  As of the last time I played the Combat rifle still keys off rifleman perks even with the auto receivers, so that can be a fun in between.
---
I hear what you are saying. But did you really expect anything different?
---
Got it by scrapping combat helmets (spawning once a day at the end of Glass Caverns)
---
Nothing official.
---
Would be funny if they did a ban wave of course.
---
Those youtubers are easy targets.
---
Facts? Nah.. get out of here.. need more mindless hate 
---
It’s not my first time just never seen it this bad
---
I've observed this happening when the mob is in "danger" on another target. Your client applies the stealth attack, the server disagrees and restores the extra damage.
---
Thanks. I'll try that now
---
Emplate356 is my psn I'd. Currently level 53 wandering the wastelands as Sam Elliott.  Complete with cowboy hat and western duster. There's a new sheriff in these parts! 
---
Should of sent him a friend request and really show him how he has messed with the wrong person xD
---
Your mistake man you let him crash there for the night
---
Agreed
---
Yeah what a great achievement.
---
FFS
---
It can be I guess, maybe (Unless you min max for shotgun). I was talking strictly about being a melee main and using the shotgun as a tool
---
Yes. Both. 
---
It's already a thing and a pretty bad one at that lol
---
Mine were acting weird. Nothing at 2. One at 5, another at 6.
---
10 triggered properly for me too so i haven't missed any.
---
Maybe try relogging a bunch?
---
Had three lvl 5s attack me with their fists, I'm lvl 126 mind you, i wanted to scare em off by knocking out one of their buddies, but i couldn't damage them with my TSE bloodied black powder pistol, so i know pvp is trash-tastic lol
---
CLAM SLAM! FTFY
---
Where does it spawn in the cavern?
---
now if we could get stuff that isn't stupid...
---
Interesting 
---
Tbh, glad you got all his junk, though how the hell does one store all that shit? Do they think it’s smart to get a bounty and break in when you’ve got that much loot of you? Just dumbasses, I swear. 
---
Well give me 30 minutes to confirm 
---
 They are level locked Perception cards.  I do not recall what level I got the 2nd one as an option.
---
Should be: 08719947
---
and on New year as well. Idk. Seems like the process is not automated.. If this is the case. Oof. The code pieces did reset but they are the same.  
---
I was going to reply with something but Nadaar beat me to it. My top is Robot Alchemic Drive if you must know.
---
Oddly those same PvP people complain the loudest when that happens to them.   Almost like they are children.  
---
I killed a dupers mule character that was wanted for breaking into my base and he had 900 plastic so I bulked most of it and put it in my stash, and dropped the rest 
---
Probably the best thing in the atom store atm, apart from maybe the fish lamp 
---
Yeah, you can convert caps into real money, just like games like WoW did(buying gold with $$)
---
Perhaps it’s because of the holidays and people receiving the game I’m seeing more griefing... then again, it’s not always the super low levels that try this dumb shit, it’ll be the ones that are 40+
---
Being annoying shouldn’t be funny to these kids, but it is. 
---
Thanks!
---
I’m not a fan of those practices 
---
I also get grieved constantly via chameleon armor/explosive weapons. There’s essentially nothing to counter it (from my knowledge anyhow). 
---
Was minding my own business just trying to get some junk at my workshop, and a dude 50+ levels higher than me appears. I give him the good old thumbs up, but my friendliness is met with a thumbs down. Next thing I know, he begins claiming the workshop &amp; immediately turns and 1-shots me. I return to get my loot, only to be met with explosive fire from seemingly nowhere, and lost a good chunk of my caps for it as well. 
---
If I'm playing it with my SO can I raise my...let's go with leg...
---
RizingToBe if you want to join. 
---
Tag an enemy who is killed and you get loot, doesn’t matter if 1 player of 16 players tag it, thy all have unique loot.
---
No tag for a player no loot for that player
---
 Agreed, it is so odd they do not exist.
---
4400 steel??? How do you have that in your stash???
---
Not to be /that/ guy, but system?
---
Do it again
---
IDk why your being down voted I didn't realize it until near that level too.
---
When in build mode  go to item edit and then select an item.  If it can be locked you pull the "left trigger (on Xbox)" and then a drop down comes up in the corner of the screen.  select the level of lock you want to use and apply it.
---
The better the lock the more junk it costs.  can go none to lvl 3 no plans needed, that I know of.
---
Funny shit and worth it. You know they were salty about that. 
---
We need a group who griefs the griefers. 
---
It’s below 75% I think. I’ve only killed one with help. 
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/cWgvaqc they do now!
---
You get the full set given on the BOS quest conclusion :-)
---
Where are you aiming?
---
We had a few confirmations from different people that this is the case.
---
Turrets/lights/ advanced power connections/ PLANTS. I was shocked at how much budget all of these consume. 
---
There is an economy.(selling serums, explosive weapons, mods...)
---
I have only found 2 good weapons and am trying to sell one of them.(TSE handmade)
---
I don't want to sell it for 500 caps to compete with dupers
---
Wrong, I have the regular and a refined that nearly matches a hardened .308.
---
I kan tipe guudder!
---
We don't know what they do yet. Pete Hinds had specifically said it's not pay to win and the Atomic Shop will be cosmetics.
---
Maybe they were for special events. In any case, they changed the tag in the code for the lunchboxes from atomic Shop prefix, so it's hopefully not something to worry about.
---
I'm comparison to Destiny, where you basically had to pay to get to the end, Fallout 76 is reasonable with their transactions. 
---
Thank you! I'll keep a look out. 
---
Well a level 82 showed up with a explosive shotgun and destroyed my base, but i repaired it with his friends mats
---
Legendary dragon can deal extreme damage.  Slow as hell but it can do thousands with the right legendary traits, perks and health levels 
---
Already did that.
---
It’s one thing when a million teens are invited into a new teen game a-la fortnite bumping into an occasional rare “old person”. 
---
 A different thing altogether when they’re invited into a hardcore franchise frequented by the first serious gaming generation. 
---
43, 4 kids, one’s almost at booze age, my gaming days go back to basic games on a Commodore MMF9000, and my min-maxing days go back to SSI games on early days PCs. 
---
SBQ is the only source of Ultracite PA or Prime plans, afaik. I’ve only done that twice, but both times she had two of each on her, so you may have just bugged or got the short end of RNGsus’s stick. Both equally possible in this game. 
---
Still being sold full price in the Xbox store and plenty of people play it. Just all the tools are weeding themselves out. Nobody wants you on anyway. For whatever reason you're still on the subreddit bitching. Get out of here if you don't want to play the game, nobody gives a shit
---
What system are you on? I can build a complete set on PS4.
---
Word
---
Hrmm. I don’t really want to but a good suggestion if true
---
I have an SO who i'm spending new years with, but secretly would love to be playing fallout. Can i just raise a finger?
---
Very early on in the game I locked the door because I  only just found you could actually lock doors are was excited about it.
---
I found that locking doors always ended up with my place getting destroyed. What happens is if you lock your door people assume there is something good inside so they lock pick it, the turrets kick in afterwards which mean the player shoot back then breaks stuff just to spite you.
---
If you have extractors you can lock them specifically but most of the time people just want to look around and then they will leave.
---
Not everyone though, some people are just dicks, not much you can do about that....
---
RemindMe! 18 hours I’m out of state but when I get home I’ll take a picture and show you. Basically I spent about an hour and a half aligning a foundation and a stairway so I could put a platform in front of the doorway and put a door in.

I've seen him three times in the last couple of sessions on the north-south road just to the east of top of the world (between the raider camp next to the train station and the wrecked trucks with the Mr Gutsys to the south). Last night helped him clear some robots from the camp. He didn't have anything I needed though (I expect once he has my other excavator calibrated shock I'll never see him again). Good luck

900 could be legit I ran across some dupers who had 100's of thousands of bulked plastic, springs, steel, aluminum and what not. I stealthboyed into their base, and started picking up all the shit they were trying to exchange via bags, Ended up with 200 Bulk springs, 200 Bulk Plastic, 500, yes 500 TSE 50 cal's 20K rounds of Shotgun ammo and 5000 Nuka Cola''s ended up weighing around 3K pounds
---
What’s your GT I guess the codes didn’t reset. I’m about to run C silo. My GT is x949Mafiax 
---
What do you mean by disconnecting the source from the plan?
---
Of course, because all the idiots that do some
---
dumb shit run to their friends and whine about how they got their ass handed to them.
---
After trying the natural route and getting egghead three times in a row as a melee... it’s worth it to just buy the serums you want.  So worth every cap. 
---
If it was similar to pricing before the dress would be 1000, the bundle of tuxedos would be 2200 and the pose would be 800.
---
It's still too expensive, but it's a step in the right direction
---
Dam man thats lucky i have just about 700 springs from him bulked
---
Except one of them is literally a bundle for the (relatively) low price of 800 atoms. 
---
Only friends and party members should show location indicators on the map.
---
For all Bethesda's bullshit about making a limited and controlled PvP, it has turned out to be exactly what so many were concerned it was: A license from the devs to troll and grief others, forcing them to expend their play time other than they wish.
---
PvP needs to be relegated to separate servers.
---
Wrong
---
Where to get the serums?
---
Really? Where else can they be found?
---
Yeah its pathetic when you bitch to your boyfriends to correct your mistakes
---
They are stat sticks, so pick one that gives the right stats. Melee types for example like shielded urban operative for the +3 strength.
---
lol I spent so long figuring this out. 
---
shut your mouth. I wanted a suit or tux since day 1. Now I have 3 and I'm happily living out my Fantasy of being a foreign agent who stowed away in vault 76 trying to survive in a world gone mad.
---
I try to use it when I need assistance but hardly anyone’s ever around whenever I’m somewhere in the land. 
---
I would do it too if the stash was unlimited!
---
The heads at Bethesda know what no one here wants to admit: Fallout 76 is this year's Mass Effect Andromeda. 
---
They're just counting their money watching everyone fight it out knowing full well the half life on the game is almost up.
---
The official word from them on duping is that they fixed it with the last patch...
---
This is obviously not true; they have not spoken on it since the last update.
---
What they have spoken on is the reload animation for the handmade and the bugged industrial purifiers people can't delete. These are slated for a "mid January patch" for the purifiers I guess that's a quick turnaround as far as Bethesda is concerned.

Mary Poppins... in hell.  Cool shot!
---
Why do you care that other people are playing the way they want to without affecting anyone else?
---
that Forest has some dope visuals for being in one of the most Dangerous places in the game. Very well done!
---
I used to make forum posts for World of Warcraft like this. Once I got to this stage I knew I was done for awhile. It seems you have the weapons and build you want. You are also tired of the only things to do in the game. 
---
Enjoy some time on another game or outside. The game will be waiting for you once it gets some new things to do.
---
What the fuck do you smoke?
---
I can confirm again. Same exact thing happened again. I should have recorded it. I did save the video clip on my PS, but I'm not sure how far those go back, or how to access them yet lol.
---
I moved my camp and it was over budget and even after scrapping things, I still had my budget meter full without even having anything placed down.
---
Scrapping every single thing and then moving my camp again gave me back all of my budget except for the 4% and glitched water purifier problem.
---
The game enough is punishment
---
Hope you enjoyed the fire there !
---
Actually just go ahead and make her a big dung pile. It's fitting. 
---
When I did my testing I kept starched genes equipped and mutations still got added from serums. It only stops you picking up random ones from rads.
---
I don't even keep a camp anymore. After the first two times of it being deleted and my blueprint not working I gave up and fully committed to being a power armoured nomad.
---
I don’t! I swear I thought it was him when I heard him talking about the quest involving the burial of the civil war soldier.
---
What do we do if we're both playing? Do we both raise our hands? I don't understand the rules. 
---
Happened to me many times, fight one guy, kill him. All of sudden he’s in a group of four, which is fine, but don’t destroy my camp because you’re salty man 
---
Are you able to launch new nukes with last weeks codes?
---
More then likely the body turned to ash/goo and the physics carries the body in the direction it was headed when it died. Happens to me a lot. The ash pile will settle where the body would rest. Probably why some ash piles don't show up. They are forever micro-bouncing.
---
Becarefull with accepting random party invites. Because they can steal your loot from workshops if you locked the resource machines.
---
Terrible idea. Do you want every member of the opposite sex to spontaneously combust from sheer sexual desire when they see you wearing that? Pretty sure the servers aren’t immune to that either. 
---
Technically you get 55
---
I would also like to see. Heavily g trouble visualizing. 
---
Hey, awesome! I'll add ya'll when I get home probably after midnight. Look forward to kickin some scorched ass!
---
I always lock my junk extractor. 
---
I also lock all the water purifiers in my water farm.
---
Purified water may not seem like alot.....
---
But they could be making off with dozens of my purified water. Thats a decent chunk of caps for me.
---
Mine tells the right time twice a day.
---
Try Awareness perk?
---
you can get a 3 star perk that heals more from each stimpack, then there is another perk that makes them heal faster, not sure if thats more than 1 star or not. Throw in the 3 star perk that auto heals you if you get below a certain health percentage and its almost impossible to die unless your one shot. 
---
The higher level mobs generally just have more armor. You can check with the perk in Perception called Awareness.
---
You'll need to buff up for armor penetration. If you find a weapon that can do significantly higher damage than they have armor.... You can somewhat skip the armor penetration (situational).
---
Experiment with Ghouls vs Watoga Robots, for example.
---
(You can grab the objectives without killing the scorcedbeast and skedaddle.)
---
r/Fo76filthycasuals is a wonderful respite from the negativity
---
Well I stand corrected
---
You can have all of them except carnivore and herbivore at the same time. My friend and I both had really good luck with getting all of them and removing them one by one to get the ones we wanted. 
---
And then get radicool and nerd rage on top of that.
---
Which platform
---
This game has been the one thing keeping me sane.
---
I injured myself in september at work and have been useless since then. As each attempt to return to work, or even try heal has failed. My life basically crashed and burned, but i love fallout 76.
---
Im level 320 in fallout 76 with over 450 hours played. The game is keeping me from having to think.
---
Upvoted for the Doctor Who reference
---
Also not heard that either lol I do know turrets take up a fuck ton of budget space. But
---
Idk shit I’m just your average Player
---
And they are clean suits!
---
I’ve managed to tame a couple of animals, but they revert back to hostile after about 30 seconds. I assume that’s intended. 
---
It really is awesome. However, be forewarned as the weapon condition drops back down to 100% the damage output drastically reduces. It is more than enough to clear a nuked Whitespring though. Repaired to 200% my drill does 54 per tick, it's a beast. 
---
A refined .50 is almost equal and in crafting ammo you get much more for the same mats.  I think they got a bit lot in trying to balance things and kind of broke the .50 sniper.  It still has a use, just not what it should be.
---
There's a nice little spot east of black Bear lodge or what ever. Has a junk and lead extractor spot you can hit with one camp. 
---
Codes did not reset this week.
---
Laptop?
---
I did the mr farmhand one on fury and got it
---
Got a friend in there right now attempting a launch. 44 Minutes past code change, pieces are still in inventory. Will update if he is successful. 
---
Scorchbeasts can drop prime plans but its rarer
---
apart from all those, pets such as the brahmin also take a healthy chunk of the budget
---
I thought this would help, but have watched guys use the power armor exploit to get through the conveyor belt hole next to the door up there.

Some one made a resource node map.

I got it, never touched a drop... gotta love this game... hahaha...

Taking the ammo factory, and to a lesser extent the Poseidon plant, always be prepared for a fight. Totally agree with OP, the high level was a dick.

Not sure the levels stack against your favor tbh... I was level 60 something and thought I Could take an active workshop level 25 guy chased me away after several deaths each way 
---
Similarly yesterday a level 199 attacked me unprovoked with his level 131 buddy I'm at 142 and one shot them both after accepting pvp. They asked for it though they attacked me for a good 5 minutes before I retaliated.... I guess my point is more to be careful who you mess with... you might get messed up especially if you are the aggressor...
---
Amen! On third toon thats above 60. Different play styles, camps, role-playing, collecting. 
---
 This is absolutely why we need a way to level weapons.
---
how do you lock your door?
---
Yeah I've seen this lol
---
Does the key code switch work? Will it keep people out?
---
Was that your first post?
---
... because it is affecting everyone else ... o_o
---
Don't keep any aid items in your stash unless you're waiting for the vendors to refresh their caps to sell them. Don't hoard junk you don't use. Throw away ammo you don't use. Learn what has good value for its weight and stop picking up things that aren't close to 100 caps per pound, like stimpaks. This is what I call "dumb weight", and the only time I pick things like that up is when I'm doing my vendor run and I know I'm just going to immediately sell them.  
---
You can also get deep pocketed on gear, legendary armor that has +1 STR or weight reductions to ammo or junk, calibrated shocks, marsupial, and underarmor that adds up to 3 STR to make your life easier. I can carry 320 outside of power armor with room for more.
---
I used to think they were tough until I got the all rise. Now I just wait for them to land and whack away 
---
Probably not hardware issues, but I feel ya!
---
How exactly?
---
No idea lol. Its probably the #1 chewing up space.
---
Enclave bunkers medical or science wing I believe.  But I know it's the Enclave bunker. 
---
I feel the same way about purifiers. And if I can't have the water. No one gets the water. Bounty be damned. 
---
It does both, beyond that you can turn them on and off.

What do you raise if you’re spending New Years playing 76 with a SO?

Fort Defiance top level kitchen...all plastic plates and utensils

West Virginia...

Freaking hard as hell! Finally got the Jetpack, just seconds away from another player snapping it off before me. Thing was, I didn't have the funds and only noticed it as I heard the steps from this other player. Sold all my Stimpacks in haste. Got it in the end. Then the player next to me, started the puke emote... lol... 
---
Oh well, now on to the shocks.
---
Happy New Year everyone!
---
I've been very lucky, got marisupial and istope one that deal radation damage to melee foes.  
---
Nevermind, dumb question...
---
I'm not accusing you of being a duper or an exploiter but damn that's a ton nof steel
---
There sure are a lot of crashed planes around the semi-wasteland - wonder if thats some dark humor Bethesda put in...
---
Where are said dupers??? Daddy has a good job and needs:
---
1. 3 star weapon

2. Full set 3 star armor

3. Another reason for the wife to be mad.

Saaaame :/
---
1. you spelled that wrong  
---
2. you don't really socialize outside much do you
---
Jeez yeah one just dropped dead on my front lawn yesterday.
---
I don’t agree with them being reasonable, since a skin for one armor or gun can run you $10 or more. Honestly, if they were more reasonable with their prices, say $2-$3 per skin, then I think more people would be willing to buy them, but right now it’s straight up greed. Also, Destiny 2 blows haha
---
If you're going non PA, I'd really along a 5* iron clad in there.
---
First person shooters like those aren't the same as an open world RPG.  You might be right, I'm not an expert on online game development by any stretch, but my understanding is the servers cost money.
---
It was pre-order only bud
---
You know?  They should make a large tent made from a SB - it would take skin and bones to make.
---
Few hundred dollars a month lol
---
Indeed,  but where's the fun in that :-)
---
The fact that you seem okay with it makes it seem like your a duper as well. Note I say seem, its a personal view. Most of the duplication glitches thus far have involved causing some form of controlled server instability which impacts everyone except for the duper (cos they want it). Not to mention it's in the EULA that it says that exploiting known bugs and glitches in the game will have consequences. Not that they have done jack diddly bout it so far. It's just a shame that they probably won't do what Arenanet did to Guild Wars 2 several days after launch.
---
Other than the fact that duping over 10000 pounds of different items on a server that can currently barely hold enough unique items for 25 players ?....
---
The duper also then sells these serums and such out for dirt cheap caps or even worse, they sell it for real money 
---
You talking about the Responder Bot that sells the hunters coat? I had to sever hop for over an hour to get that one outfit. Fallout fans arent used to that. Remember when you would meet someone and think "Oh, that's a nice outfit. Either they are giving me that for completing a quest or imma bout to murder someone for a coat." We used to get outfits for completing questline. If it worked like that in 76 we would be showing off the amount of time we put into a faction or questline. Now it just makes people think we are dupers, xp cheaters, and people with no life that server hop for hours on end for a cosmetic.
---
The drop rates are wonky and all the good stuff is too rare. I get 10 troubleshooters for every 2 shot I get and even when I get the good legendary it's on a shitgun. Not to mention all the Single action ivory grips floating around...they need to show this whole system a little more attention. 
---
How do you even follow people to different servers?
---
=/
---
I said a failed experiment, meaning that Fallout as an identity does not fit this 'games as service' genre. So in that respect they tried and failed, however no game is beyond saving it just depends if Bethesda care enough to fix the state it is in. But if Bethesda want to win back the trust and goodwill of players then they will need to fix it. Especially as they have Starfield and Elder Scrolls releasing next, people will remember this fiasco and they will be much more sceptical of future games. 
---
I would love to share my 4 main builds. I wanted to try out multiple different playstyles, so I bit the bullet and went hard leveling characters early on. By far my most favorite way to play Fallout 76 is with my [2H Melee build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3d3589&amp;d=s40sm0sn0se2ss2eo2e82lt2i44a72a00el0sg2er2a40aa1pf0c71la2ah0lb0ek1lr1e00pe0sy2&amp;w=pm0l71eu0cr0c31pa0p80p90eq1i30ia0i50ag2c52ep1&amp;n=Omnipotent%202H%20Melee%20v3.1). It just annihilates everything and hardly takes any damage in my [X-01 Power Armor](https://i.imgur.com/PVVj2Hp.png). I love melee and I hope it stays this awesome.
---
**Important Notes Regarding All Of My Builds**: I always get 3* Lead Belly and at least 1* in Cannibalism. This allows you to heal for free and completely ignore hunger. All you have to do is eat a few people here and there.
---
I am a solo player so my builds all use Lone Wanderer. If you plan to play in a group, you should experiment with other CHR perks to find a more optimal setup.
---
All of my builds have an option for Starched Genes, as this is a requirement for Mutation builds. If you do not like mutations and/or you intend to ignore them, you can opt to remove this perk and any SPECIAL points associated with it if you deem it necessary.
---
&lt;====================&gt;
---
#**Build #1 [\[PA\] 2H Melee Build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3d3589&amp;d=s40sm0sn0se2ss2eo2e82lt2i44a72a00el0sg2er2a40aa1pf0c71la2ah0lb0ek1lr1e00pe0sy2&amp;w=pm0l71eu0cr0c31pa0p80p90eq1i30ia0i50ag2c52ep1&amp;n=Omnipotent%202H%20Melee%20v3.1)** or [2H Melee Build (PA Optional)](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3d3589&amp;d=s40sm0sn0se2ss2eo2e82lt2i44a72a00el0sf2sg2er2a40aa1pf0c71la2ah0lb0ek1lr1e00pe0&amp;w=l71eu0cr0c31pa0p80p90eq1i30ia0i50ag2c52ep1pm0&amp;n=Omnipotent%202H%20Melee%20v3.0)
---
**Personal Rating**: S
---
**Leveling**: Surprisingly easy to level with. Get a high damage 2h weapon like a board, axe, pickaxe, etc: and engage enemies at a close range. If you find yourself in a situation where you're taking too much damage, back off and keep a sniper in your inventory to pick off long range enemies. Most enemies seem to take a lot of damage from melee and as soon as you get 3* Incisor, armored enemies will die quickly too. Robots that can absorb bullets like a sponge will cower in fear to your big 2H weapons.
---
**How To Play**: Super Sledge or other high damage 2H Melee Weapon works wonders. Run around and 1-2 shot most enemies. You take severely reduced damage from melee and hit like a freight train. It's impossible for your limbs to be damaged so it's also very tough for enemies to slow you down short of becoming overencumbered. Makeshift Warrior 5* means your weapons will hardly ever break. As a bonus: when they do break, the repairs are usually basic materials.
---
**Notes**: If you use PA, replace 3* Barbarian with another STR ability ([eg: 3* Pain Train](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3d3589&amp;d=s40sm0sn0se2ss2eo2e82lt2i44a72a00el0sg2er2a40aa1pf0c71la2ah0lb0ek1lr1e00pe0sy2&amp;w=pm0l71eu0cr0c31pa0p80p90eq1i30ia0i50ag2c52ep1&amp;n=Omnipotent%202H%20Melee%20v3.1)).
---
#**Build #2 [Sniper/Rifleman \(PA Optional\)](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f548b8&amp;d=e82e00el0pd2pk1pl1pr2p61pp2lt2li2l71a72a51an2ic4sg2s01c72ib2ao0a00ah0&amp;w=eq1pa0p80p90ag2i30ia0i50c31c52iq2&amp;n=OmniRifle%20v1.12)** 
---
**Personal Rating**: A
---
**Leveling**: Get a hunting rifle as fast as possible (they are very abundant) and you're good to go. .308 ammo is very plentiful in this game so you should have almost no problem finding more ammo for it. Lots of enemies drop hunting rifles as well so you can learn plans fairly quickly from scrapping them.
---
**How To Play**: This build is a classic ranged build which takes advantage of stealth sniper rifles. Try to avoid direct combat as much as possible, though it's okay if you do have melee characters getting in up close as 3* Blocker causes you to take 45% reduced melee damage. If you constantly stealth around and aim for the head/weak spots, you can end up killing a lot of enemies without even getting shot.
---
**Notes**: Very powerful solo build early on, but tends to start feeling a little weaker later on until you can get better legendary weapons like 2 shot explosive. Overall quite strong however.
---
#**Build #3 [[PA] Heavy Weapons Guy](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f343a6f&amp;d=el0e82p02sq2s32sr2ip2a72a00a30a80lt2l12ls2ih2st1s20s12c71l22s82l71lu0ic0&amp;w=i30ia0pa0p80p90eq1ag2i50cr0at1c52&amp;n=OmniPower%20HvyWpn%20V3.1)**
---
**Personal Rating**: B/C (Early game), A (End game)
---
**Leveling**: Similar to the Shotgunner build, this is a slow leveling build because you need some levels to get heavy weapon perks, there are no good low level heavy weapons, and it's hard to stockpile ammo at first. Start by using any weapons you can find (eg: hunting rifle) until around level 25-30 when you can start using some heavy weapons. Stockpile 5mm ammo and try to find a [Gatling Gun](https://imgur.com/sDYOCtv) as soon as possible. It can be tough to keep up with the ammo cost of these things, so you will probably need to swap weapons from time to time and switch it up a little. 
---
The first 40ish levels are slower than other builds, but things to tend to pick up a lot once you've got some decent legendaries and heavy weapon perks.
---
**How To Play**: Classic heavy weapons build where you can unload bullets like crazy on anything and everything you see. Stabilized allows your heavy weapons to ignore 45% of armor so even armored targets will get shredded quickly. Nothing too special but fun nonetheless. 
---
If you are lucky with V.A.T.S. you can get free repairs. Grim Reapers Sprint can proc fairly often and restore all of your AP. Allowing you to spray more bullets into your enemies. Also after you kill an enemy in V.A.T.S., Gun Fu automatically selects the next person (JUST TAKE CARE NOT TO ACCIDENTALLY SHOOT OTHER PLAYERS).
---
**Notes**: There were a lot of points spent in Luck which could be considered optional. I would recommend making some changes there first if you are looking to adjust this build in any way. I had a little trouble finding perks that seemed powerful with this build. But adjusting points around for some explosive perks might be decent if you intend to use TSE weapons.
---
#**Build #4 [Shotgunner \(PA Optional\)](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f65458d&amp;d=el0ei0lh1l71lu2a72sd1su2so1sp2pc2le2lt2ic4e82c72as2a00a40s01p02sg2&amp;w=ce0ev2lm2i30ia0i50pa0p80p90iq2i61eq1c52cr0c31at1ag2ie1ih1if2ij2&amp;n=OmniShotgun%20V1.00)** 
---
**Personal Rating**: B (Early game), ? (End game [not yet achieved with this build])
---
**Leveling**: Similar to the Heavy Weapons build, this is a slow leveling build mainly due to the fact that a standard low level shotgun is not very strong. The upgrades give it a lot more range and at the damage falls off within a very short distance at first. Start by using any weapons you can find (eg: hunting rifle) until you have some decent shotgun perks and upgrades.
---
**How To Play**: When upgraded, this build can really decimate enemies at close range. While it may still be weak at range, you can always keep a rifle on hand to try and pick off long range enemies.
---
**Notes**: It may be obvious from the build, I currently use PA with this build. But that is entirely optional and you can remove/ignore those perks if you prefer to play without PA. My version of this character 
---
I hope this helps some of you guys looking for a new build and/or improving their own.
---
I'm 100% open to critique and criticism. If you think one or more of my build suck, let me know! I'm all ears and I'd love to debate on possible improvements wherever possible. :)
---
This I did not know. I don’t bother to keep pets. Good info thank you. 
---
I completely agree with you that it isn't a single player game. I was mainly illustrating how I choose to play. But the fact is that they gave us an option that basically says "I would like to opt out of pvp" and I would simply like it to remain that way across the whole game.
---
Ive finished the game, what BOS quest is it?
---
Not quite. There is Pacify that calms them down for about 30 seconds, then if all the above criteria are met you can Tame them and they will walk around you camp, fuck up intruders, and give a wanted level to any Marsupial assholes wearing Santa costumes that jump over your walls into your courtyard and kill your Deathclaw with an Explosive pump action shotgun. 
---
Nope, full desktop PC.
---
SBQ? 
---
Tell me do you think it'd be all right
---
If I could just crash here tonight
---
You can see I'm in no shape for driving
---
And anyway I've got no place to go
---
And you know it might not be that bad

You were the best I'd ever had

Holy shit thank you
---
Can confirm
---
I agree about funding free dlc, it’s a necessary thing these days, but I was being sarcastic. The prices are ridiculous and they would make more off sales if they weren’t so high. I also think it’s offensive that the game needs many fixes, but they keep shoveling out new Atom Shop content.
---
Ok but look at fortnite: they did their own one time event and it went through just fine. Why would Bethesda not follow suit?
---
The NY skins are cheaper, but I agree 1800 for a power armor is steep. 
---
What platform, what you lost? I have many sets..  
---
Updated drivers?
---
When in workshop edit mode, look at door &amp; it will be the button option the furthest left (LT on Xbox). 
---
The Enclave has no record of such mission being authorized.  President Eden will be informed. 
---
I’m in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean on a drill rig playing on PC. ☺️
---
Not a duper BTW, all hard earned :-)
---
Been several days since this last happened, so I thought maybe it was fixed, but then tonight at White Springs, after Killing 3 Legendary Ghouls, all 3\* in a row, I got mobbed and killed myself with the TSE.
---
Immediately after re-spawning, the server disconnected, and I could not re-connect to the same server, so loot, &amp; legendary loot was lost forever.
---
BETHESDA!!! Please fix this, I should always reconnect to the same server if I have left a loot bag somewhere.
---
ritual mask and tattered dress
---
Two people standing together for a long time, usually very different in levels from each other.
---
yeah, dont wait for confirmation.  hit one then immediately go and hit the other.  bounce back and forth between them if you have to.
---
Still happening.  Sometimes it gets fixed by logging out and in again, but that's annoying when the quests take you near multiple scorch beasts...
---
Wow man, wouldn’t want that carry weight but shit that’s lucky, like previously said. Least you got about 5000 free caps and all that ammo. Was this PC? 
---
‘cause I’ve noticed a lot of dupers on Xbox. 
---
It's on a timer, just hit the first one then run immediately to the next without waiting for the quest messages to update. I have completed it twice. I think it's meant for 2 people to activate it at the same time. The timer is quick but you can make it
---
'If it's bad why play it'.
---
'Don't say it's bad if you haven't played it'.
---
'Why do people keep writing articles about it'. Well typically people keep writing articles about things that keep happening, oh my god there were football matches last week are they still writing stories about this weeks scores? Move on to another sport please...
---
That looks like explosive vents not calibrated shocks. Different mods. 
---
O u
---
Totally feel you, haha. I can't imagine people actually spending money on their awful cash shop. 1 skin for 1 item, no thank you.
---
I've never really been one of those people though, so I don't think I've ever understood the appeal of it in the first place.
---
We do have flares though
---
Happened to me 4 times today I a nike zone. Was so pissed off
---
Bedroom &amp; power room, a “vendor” counter (if I have one); reason being those are all areas/thing I want to have enough time to put on my ass-kicking pants before dealing with any rabble rousers. 
---
They went to my profile and joined from there, until I appeared offline. 
---
Ok if you can't get in tonight, which I really recommend then do something you normally wouldn't do. Like for instance watch a movie from a genre you normally don't fully appreciate. Or play a game that you never finished. Any way if you want to talk add me on PSN I'm under MemETic1.
---
Code accepted at 00:56 UK time.
---
I lock up my shop because have a farm inside. My resourse extractors and water purifiers are also locked up because
---
when I NEED water I don't want to jump to my base and find out that someone has taken all of it.
---
Keeping in mind in that 5 minutes they were attacking me I was buffing up on physchotats and setting my skills to maximum damage and putting level 3 barbarian on and trading off my junk to my party in the event I lost... if you gonna battle.. do it right
---
Glitches are canon, since we are all pod people.
---
You still do reduced damage for a more plentiful ammo type.
---
Good to know 
---
You're not President Eden so how do you know it wasn't authorized?
---
Sweet. Good to know. Time to hunt some fart dragon. 
---
Damn. Tell him to hook a brotha up! (jk) xD
---
No kidding though. At 20 lbs a pop those are hardly ever worth carrying unless you're a heavy weapons guy IMO. It's sad because you know they are good, but it's probably not worth the hassle unless you're heavily trading.
---
Thank you for explaining 
---
Time to nuke flatwoods
---
I thank you for the attempt at helping, but that doesn't work on my phone. I tried that and the interactive map, to no avail.
---
With all the explosive vent drops we get, they should allow us to attach them to every PA piece and make a belly flop build.
---
When you end with that room protected by lasers, you are given a full set. People assume it's just a chassis and scrap it, that's a top level full set :-)
---
Ah!  Chems worked.  Not sure why alcohol wouldn't, but got it.  Thanks!
---
jet pack is fun, but it eats cores like crazy.
---
I agree
---
Its not an alienware is it? For me, the game is not playable until i disable a slew of alienware programs. Tobii eye tracking is the main one. 
---
Also if you have a Nvidia driver....
---
Goto- control panel
---
Nvadia control panel. 
---
Make sure the right graphics card is selected for the game. For me it kept going for GPU/integrated instead of performance graphics by default. I had to manually change that.
---
Took me weeks to get this game to run right.
---
Here’s my guide to doing this, I’m on Xbox-  
---
1. Don’t just jump onto a server with the intention of swapping items, you need to make sure that some of the other players are going to be there when you come back with your other character, pay special attention to players who have claimed workshops, especially the “good ones”- Charleston junkyard, the ammunition factory, hemlock, etc. as they are invested in the server, same for players running the silos to launch nukes. What you’re trying to avoid is server hoppers for obvious reasons. So I’ll usually play my session and do this after a good while.
---
2. Pull up the social tab and find these players, go to their profiles and check to make sure they haven’t made themselves “appear offline” so that you can join their game. DO THIS WITH SEVERAL PLAYERS ON THE SERVER, the more the better. Write the names down if necessary.  
---
3. Find a low traffic area on the server, not a marked location. There are tons of unmarked locations with containers you can use. The forest is best because of the original post, by the time you want to put effort into transferring items they will be to high of level for levels 1-16 enemies that are in the forest (not confirmed, but I just used a savage divide location and the scorched ganking my toy happened there and I haven’t run across it in the forest). 
---
4. Make sure you are alone, use stealth getting to your intended container so nobody snipes your sweet gear (I’ve definitely had to abort because someone who probably had no idea what I was actually doing came along to interact with me or just happened that way).  
---
5. Deposit loot, check social tab again to confirm your join targets. Take a deep breath, exit server.  
---
6. Select character in main menu that is the intended recipient. Pull up the social tab, highlight player and join game on them.  
---
7. RUN LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDED ON IT TO YOUR CONTAINER, time is of the essence. There is a chance that the player you joined on DC’d and rejoined a different server, if your item(s) are not there make sure the local population is dead and looted and pull up your social tab and join on a backup. I have had to do this once and it was for one of the best drops I’ve had, I was able to recover the item but I about had an anxiety attack.  
---
That’s how I transfer items with no help, and I’ve done it about a dozen times with a 100% success rate. Hope it helps.  
---
Also, it would be real sweet if I could just get drops that are appropriate for my various builds and not have to do this but it is what it is. 
---
Exchanging?
---
You weren't dropping stuff on the ground were you?
---
Yep. I legit cannot find one reason why this is running so badly.
---
Open the one in gorge junkyard and get a raider PA set.
---
I noticed, still annoying cause some were in 4, but maybe they’re improving...
---
How you get tse guns
---
Sorry man try [this](https://m.imgur.com/9Rccgzd). Just trying to make sure the right people get credit for the post
---
Green shirt and combat boots with the beret.  Black glasses.  Pink skater haircut.  Chick.
---
I’ve only had it crash on me like twice, I’m on PS4 Pro. 
---
I’ve had like things break on me, where I’ve had to quit and restart, like bugs. But only 2 actual crashes. 
---
Yeah the assaultrons certainly do
---
Its been pretty slow in gaming lately.
---
I'm surprised the internet didn't snap over atlas.
---
Couple bits of info for you since I read this SO MUCH
---
PvP areas might get you into PvP situations.
---
Leveling ends at 50. If he's lvl 400 and you're 50. You have the same amount of stats. 
---
I couldnt view the interactive or imgur site using my phone. So that's why I posted here for help.
---
Thanks for tip. New build " the driller killer"
---
This. I stopped unequipping it after I got my last mutation. I currently have 7 I think and I just can't play the game any more without there effects. It feels too sluggish without them, so I saved my caps and bought a serum for each one just in case I ever fuck up.
---
Scrapping power armor items seems like a good idea in theory, except what will really happen is every power armor suit on the server will get farmed and stripped, and then no one will have power armor except for the few people playing 16 hours a day who will have massively overpowered PA.
---
It's bad enough right now. I am about to hit level 40 and doing regular sweeps of a bunch of locations, I still have not found the last leg piece to complete my T-51b set. At least 50% of the time the frame has already been taken 
---
&gt; PvP is garbage in this game
---
Anyone who won't admit this has Bethesda two feet deep in their ass. There's nothing enjkyable or challenging about having god tier weapons that let you instakill anyone regardless of armor.
---
They should have installed McAfee on those robots. :D :D :D lol i'm precious..... 
---
I like grabbing a miners outfit, gasmask, and pickaxe and running around like I'm Harry Warden.  Now if I could just find a hockey mask to go with my machete...
---
Shhh, she's watching Youtube or probably already asleep.
---
Wait that was a whole set up top quality power armor? I dropped it cause I thought it was just a chassis and I already had one with excavator. Damn. 
---
I miss speed demon :(
---
I wanted matsupial.
---
Got twisted muscles (am rifle build).  
---
Then empath.
---
Had to start again.
---
Got marsupial...now scared
---
Well they nerfed server hoping so its a possibility now
---
No problem if you have bird bones!
---
Confetti pose has an infinite spawn of confetti animated around you. I kind of love it.
---
haha not a duper at all.. just a hoarder.
---
So i guess i calibrated my game unintentionally (which is good i guess i calibrated it to the eating contest) and the quest is still in my pip boy so do i just go in and out of the park until it triggers?
---
something in the area of 11-12ish%, also nasty blow.
---
but i didnt know about the advanced power lines, which i used somewhat in my last camp
---
That's how it worked in Fallout 4. It doesn't in 76 unless I'm missing some step in the process.
---
Look into ipresentinterval in the .ini file also
---
What did they do to server hopping?
---
Can confirm Charlie did NOT reset
---
Oh hey, I just posted about this earlier! Isn’t that great how a level 15 power armor set is locked behind a level 40 lock?
---
In the newest update it was patched, now you just have to do the minigame each in-game day, only once an in-game day
---
I finally heard some voices after disabling all the recording devices in the Windows audio control panel.
---
I don't know for sure if that's what fixed it, but that's what I tried and now I hear people.
---
One of my dream jobs now would be to work for Bethesda to help them build a lower debt codebase.  (with the guidance of the experts there as I am only two years into my career)  
---
Hey Bethesda, you want to make this a learning lesson and do things right?
---
Nope, not an Alienware, it's my own build.
---
Yeah, and if you're a real mutant.
---
I've gotten into the habit of blowing away the prize bot as soon as I see him
---
I take a look tomorrow when I get access to my PC, thanks.
---
yay
---
It's never a smart idea to put your generators outside; I can always tell the people new to building apart from the veterans just by that. You should move it somewhere more protected if you have the space.
---
Pretty sure they have weird builds. Like melee builds dont work the same. 
---
Thats so fucked up but so funny. here, have an upvote
---
Never really thought about it. I did in the beta, but I guess it was ignored. I might say something again.
---
Also im on psn and so its in game day/night intervals not actual day/night
---
furthest i go is Flatwoods. Where the heck is Whitespring?
---
Ahh, alright
---
Then we'd all be the same with a mindless build.
---
Afraid so my friend...
---
Soo is it different?
---
Do Brahmin do anything for you? Also where is the recipe located under? I know I have it, but never see it.
---
Nope, it's the same, just each day/night cycle
---
Sorry I forgot to mention that it's imgur that doesn't work on my phone, you did good it's not your fault.
---
Yeah, I've ran into it a few times, all lvl 1 eyebots?
---
Well no SO but im playing 76 to avoid a possible DUI if that counts!  Not leaving the house tonight!  Pizza, beer, booze, weed, and games all at the ready!
---
Also a bunch of the plants are irradiated but there wasn't a nuke, so this is only getting weirder.
---
Level 7?  Wtf.
---
Ppl need to stop crying when their in zones they have no business being in.
---
Pretty close. I have to run up to my team to heal them.
---
Game day/nights
---
Pacifist and becoming wanted aren't related.  Pacifist just means you can't accidentally start a PVP fight. 
---
You STOLE someone's stuff and became Wanted. You really need to be warned about that??? It's common sense. But now you know and you shouldn't make the mistake again. 
---
They have enough real problems that they need to address.
---
And I'm not a PvP'er either.
---
TIL servers get horny.
---
From what I understand, yes
---
Not just a fix but also a workaround. Which is a lot better than nothing. Right now people can get put into gamebreaking situations that halt progress entirely (a developers nightmare).
---
The reset button would at least allow players to progress further.
---
Have you not yet met ants? At least 10 times worse.
---
PS4
---
Drank whiskey just before i killed the queen scorchbeast. That worked. Various beers while defending a workshop against those small chinese robots took care of the other challenge.
---
Thank you very much for your help
---
I said we have no record of such mission. And that President Eden will be informed.

---
 &gt;figured out my problem. I was running my refresh rate at 144hz once i changed it to 60 it was fine. 
---
Nope. 
---
Nah, these are lvl 50 and 38 protectrons. Some have tracks like robobrains.
---
&gt;blazingatom

But everyone is already taking the pieces / frame, not sure it would make a huge difference..
---
adding.
---
dog lipstick.
---
Hi, I would like the double barrel, you still online? 
---
fair points, especially considering how quickly they break, but still..
---
Hmm, haven't seen that there.  Have seen it happen elsewhere though.
---
Yeah I use the switch to shut off my rad shower and it uses a noticeable chunk of budget 
---
good info... Will edit.
---
Nope, bottom of the map, south of Lake Eloise.
---
There is two ways to get power armor out. One is to drop it which makes you lose it if you don’t hope in it to claim again. The second is to place it. You will get a green outline like in camp build mode. Armor placed in this way reverts to your inventory even with a server crash. 
---
What level are you and if you are on Xbox I’d be willing to help you out with something to get you by. I upgraded a friends excavator armor to lvl 45 and took his lvl 25. Extra set I was going to pass on to a low level player either way. 
---
No problem. Happy new year!
---
You want to rent an Atlas server? Private quadrants? $600 a month. holds hundreds of players. Bethesdas hold what, 25? Crash all the time? A few hundred bux sounds about right.
---
That's honestly a dumb excuse for super mutants
---
&gt;oops we spilt some FEV in our water before the war
---
And they released it way to late
---
So much feels there
---
Whoa there, you think they would actually be able to add something like that by 2030?
---
I doubt they would discount the items if it was for a major money making holiday like Christmas, Halloween, etc. I hope I am wrong though. 
---
You are encumbered. 
---
economy implies real money value. there's none in Fo76.
---
We need more memes and shitposts in this sub. 
---
Title: Fuck this shit im out..
---
Post: ...of snacks because i love playing this game all night long!!!!!!!
---
&gt; Don't be that guy in the corner of the party scowling and cleaning his weapons. Have some fun.
---
How presumptuous of you.
---
I'm the same way.  Cut off the nose to spite the face, but damn if I will let anyone take advantage of me.  Admittedly, it means I lose a lot playing Risk with friends.
---
Have an upvote.
---
I hit the queen. Will probably do it again when the silo resets. 
---
I'm PC,  I have X01 prototype with recon mod and calibrated shocks, X01 Blackbird with Recon helmet and jetpack, BOS Ultracite, Top level Excavator and Nuke Cola armour x3.
---
Can't display them so I give them away (except BOS)...
---
PC
---
&gt; If it's not going to really affect revenue in one way or another, it gets back-burnered, sometimes forever.
---
100% true. Sooooo many companies are still using insanely outdated versions of software. Just because they don't want to have to update and possibly break what is already working.
---
Drop them in a bag in the hallway of white springs. Wish I’d find a bag of goodies like I drop on the regular. 
---
LOL Sorry! Thanks for seeing that. I linked the wrong Screenshot! I just updated it
---
Its just a little cricket! 🦗 
---
Nope.  Keep on getting disconnected.  I'm done for the day.  
---
Its a little red pellet (kinda like a tic tac) that comes out of a dogs no no zone
---
Haha yeah I was mad the other night I left a server to get away from this asshole griefing log back in right in front of him and get killed
---
I wondered if it was something for New Years? Since Bethesda made that instagram post about meeting at the Whitespring Bar at 11:45 est.
---
They did nothing to server hopping. lol They only changed spawn rates.
---
On PS4. Thank you though! I love how helpful the community is! It all repopulated in my stash box for whatever reason. Not sure what happened. I am familiar with the different ways to place the armor down. 
---
Yeah, the weapon balance in 76 isn't as great as the previous games IMO.
---
Hah. I genuinely dislike the whole "Teabagging / mocking laughs / condescending" attitude in PvP. Good to see that you got him back!
---
Same rugs from Fallout 4... I don't think they are that bad but of course there could always be more variety; variety is the spice of life.
---
*purely cosmetic microtransactions to fund future content instead of paid DLC that breaks up the playerbase. 
---
People would bitch constantly about paid DLC and now they're bitching because developers are trying to bring that same content by selling cosmetics.
---
I doubt it, its probably a glitch with the  cell spawning different enemies.
---
Mine is all open, I'm happy for passers by to help themselves to my water and vegetables and benches, it's in the forest so hopefully low levels find it useful. I hope they clean the mouthpiece of the tuba after playing it though. I've only had one person try to trash it so far.
---
I know it was accidental but that's funny.
---
Or hook it up to wires.
---
&gt; Lol furious doesn't even increase damage
---
it does, it is broken on some weapons though.
---
Gattling it works FINE on.... as many dead queens will attest to.
---
If it’s like how it is in FO4, it caps at 150% over normal damage (250% damage per shot at the 10th hit and after) 
---
Two shot doesn’t double damage. The second shot gets no benefits from perks and such. It only deals base damage.
---
Furious is crazy overpowered.
---
That's not the point its been almost 2 months ago since it was released and people are still making articles. Its not like it's last weeks sports game it's two months ago game. Also describing it like a sport doesn't make much sense because OP is talking about get off the game/series not gaming in general. It would be more like move onto a diffrent sports teams from the one you like, which makes since because if you don't like the team you pick another one not abandon the sport all together. Also Happy New Year if it hasn't been happened yet for you.
---
Cook it into a steak and eat it for +3 INT.
---
Cook and eat it.
---
"Just above profit margin" ...oh you sweet summer child.
---
Yeah what this guy's said gotta be fast run from one ti the other it's like awole bots talk to guy out front and fail b4 he finished talking now I talk and go in and hit the button 
---
Was wondering that myself.  Be nice if they gave some descriptions or examples of some of the things in the AS.
---
I DO have an SO, and it's her birthday. Yeah, I'm still playing. But, since it's her birthday, I am taking a break to go pick up the pizza. 
---
Surprisingly not yet...
---
Push to talk is indeed implemented for PC at the very least. Got pushed through in one of the last couple patches. Also, happy cakeday to you. ;)
---
Food
---
I disagree, I think people would be able to use the extra points for different playing style variations and still have 34 perk points they could not use still leaving room for everyone not to have the same perks. I know I wouldn't waste my points with shotgun, pistol, explosive, etc. perks because I prefer to play with a rifle. Thus, I'd allocate my points to more stealth, rifle, and carry weight perks.
---
Also, considering how many power armor melee builds I've run into and after reading people complaining about the game showing preference to melee play styles, I think we've already got a problem with people choosing the same builds.
---
You play on console? I got loads of ammo in my stash depending on what you use.
---
Yeah.... About that shit I was giving a teammate some stuff to make radshield - not duping anything dropped some stuff so they could pick it up and some guy shows up grabs the bag then starts spamming crap about me duping. I dont dupe, never have so I am like what the hell, how does me a higher level giving me a teammate like 10 antiseptic to make radshield with make me a duper? So as you guys take on the mantle of bethesda police try not to screw up normal player games
---
Thank you for your hard work!
---
Explain how you get 500 atoms in an hour. It's not realistic unless you are grinding alts.
---
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=fallout+76+launch+codes+24-31+December
---
What level are you?  I always see just brick!
---
See above. Thank you though!! 
---
Its a bit upsetting that Bethesda actually listens to and responds to this community. 
---
Its like legitimate politicians reaponding to  r/politics. Reddit is great. Redditors are awful. 
---
&gt; its been almost 2 months ago since it was released and people are still making articles
---
Because it is still, currently, shit. Not because it was shit 2 months ago.
---
Holy dam that was me!!!! 
---
Never said anything about what you are allowed, or not allowed to do. I just see see lots of post of people bitching, which is fine. I just sometimes also post that I personally do not experience the crashing, freezing, and lag that others post about. I’ve seen only a few posts of others that don’t seem to have issues like myself.
---
I think he means there’s no differentiating what’s ok and what’s not ok to loot. As in past games, regular junk was white in text while red text ment it would be stealing. Buddy got wanted for looting the press box at the demo derby place. Took us a minute to realize we weren’t teamed up lol. So I killed him, gave him chems to compensate for his cap lose and called it good. 
---
I'd rather be home playing. I forgot to switch out to my lone wanderer perk while the SO wasn't looking. Now I'm stuck "sharing". Bah Hum Mirelurk...
---
Like the BoS... Oh wait
---
They are only invincible until their ap runs out, you just have to shoot them enough then they will suddenly die
---
180 
---
I leave the building unlocked so players can use the workstations, but the door leading to the purifiers is locked as are the purifiers themselves. I also lock the gates that surround my farm.
---
You can buy caps for dollars, does that count? 
---
Got it, thanks
---
I would like the opportunity to at least upgrade.  I waited, and rightly so, until a price drop before buying.
---
Farming for hours or buy it.
---
This is why I aim at the head it's a 1 shot kill vs 2-5 body
---
And then one shot yourself  with firing to close and be a hindrance on your team when you die every time you get hit. 
---
Same to you
---
Sucks for sure.  Luckily so far my experiences have been mostly positive and almost no negative but im sure we will all have this happen at some point.  IMO the biggest issue with this game is non-persistent servers.  Servers need to be one toon per account and you always log on to the same server.  People keep complaining about no NPC's.  I dont need npc's.  I do need a server community (this game is like a RP server communities wet dream) and we cant have it due to new server every time we logon.   This would fix other issues also like giving real reasons to capture and hold a workshop.  They would have to do something about item/container/mob spawns though.  As of now people just server hop to get new mobs, that would have to be addressed for sure.
---
I feel ya man. I just lost my marsupial the other day cause I only have 3 points in luck. I threw on super duper to make some ammo before I went to go fight the scorched beast queen and forgot to put starched genes back on. But hey, it's good to get a break to remind you of what it's like without it. Also it's kinda nice not jumping 15 feet in the air when you try and "search" something. 
---
My boyfriend always writes this won't but i never correct him.. its hard not to though
---
Note: I already quit playing. But Bethesda released a broken game. People are going to exploit it. Rather than banning players for exploiting the game, they should fix it. 
---
Lazy... 
---
Not only do people enjoy watching/reading criticism, it can be helpful to them. People also enjoy writing criticism, if they feel they understand why something is shit. 
---
Now imagine you’re running a youtube channel revolving around video game criticism, and something shit rolls around. You have something to say, you want to say it, and people want to hear it. If the shit thing is deceitful in its shitness, a crusade against the shit feels like a duty.
---
Gotcha, that makes more sense. It's switched back to ghouls now, but they're still dropping legendary items. Whatever it is, it's replenishing my caps, so I'm happy!
---
Well except not everyone is doing that because I do find some. 
---
Thank you!  I firgot it was cakeday!  So many karma whoring meme posts i missed out on.
---
Bye
---
I somehow put my power armor piece in the food processor in feed the people while clicking on the soy protein, so...
---
Reminds me of the Splatter cannon in 4. Good times. 
---
Am I the only one who had trouble reading this?
---
k bye 
---
For sure, I'll take robots over ghouls any day of the week!
---
Yea asked myself the same after i found a book shelves without books.. 
---
TSE will be nerfed in to the ground. Combat in general needs an overhaul and balancing.

Unfinished. Not “arguably unfinished.” We have metrics by which we judge games and “being able to play them without game breaking quests stopping your progress” and “highly unstable servers that prevent your from playing entirely and frequently reset your progress” are sure signs of an unfinished game. 
---
How do you pick up a bag?
---
If you don't mind spending your time, in a game you payed for, grinding mindlessly.
---
What are you doing here? r/Fallout is more your speed. 
---
How isn’t it last budget limit! 
---
Have you ever played Rust? It's a rough game and a griefers haven.
---
To bad they despawn when you get too far away from the workshop 
---
Remember, they mostly have explosive weapons as well. Its game over if they get one shot on you. One shot is all they need. You need multiple. And AP doesnt factor cause the dickhead I was facing was over encumbered and moving slow anyways.
---
I use them as barriers sometimes. Help me to avoid falling down the stairs from the 4th floor :-)
---
We cant even successfully, consecutively party up yet lol
---
Set the fast travel to be inside? How do you do that?
---
There was a bug that repeatedly stored items creating hundreds of copies.
---
That is the result.
---
Fun fact, he can't change much of anything. Can't connect wires or build anything new.
---
I bet it makes him crash more often too.
---

---
Pvpers can get creative. I think it makes this game great. Folks like you hate it. 
---
The funny thing is... Will pvp servers actually make PK'ers leave?
---
PK =/= PvP
---
While I agree that they have to make money 'somehow', the amount of corners they cut early on should be able to fund the short term until they fix the game to a paper able to sustain itself. Not expecting them to do this and encouraging supporting their current model of business is endorsing an awful, low quality cash-grabbing philosophy of running a business.
---
No, I just got off cause I have to go pick someone up. I'm hoping to be back on for a bit in a little over and hour. I'll let you know. 
---
Plants stay irradiated for a few hours after the nuke so perhaps there had been one on the server earlier. 
---
Lol
---
"push" vs "press".

---
34 years. You have 34 years. Give or take.
---
I have this exact same bug on PC.  Was trying to figure out where and how to report bugs so that I could report this.  Anyone know for PC?
---
I drop trash gear and bulk and sell junk daily. Only way I can make it work.
---
They're gonna spawn a shit ton of SB's and scorched to keep you from FT, then nuke the site from orbit.  Its the only way to be sure. XD
---
Everyone would be 15 str and 15 in agi or per for a weapon type.
---
And another 15 in luck for vats spam.
---
We'd all be the same
---
Just glad they did fix the explosive weapon glitch. Doesn't help me get the explosive combat rifle back but, at least enemies won't inexplicably regain a majority of their health with each consecutive hit. 
---
It sucks atm but how often are you forced to engage in PVP?  Not ripping you or anything like that.  Im generally curious as I basically PVE and ignore PVP.  I think Ive been forced to engage in PVP , 2 times so far in many hours played.  To me its not really been an issue, though Im sure everyones luck is different.
---
Also just a heads up but if you get a bounty by accident you can just server hop and clear it.  WHile that sucks sometimes (of you have capped any workshops), but at least its a way out.
---
Hopefully they allow private persistent servers eventually with toggleable options for PVP and other stuff.
---
It's a super rare item you can put into a robobrain that makes it a level 250 10 Star Boss that drops 13 legendary lead pipes and 38000 syringer ammo. You only need to craft the whole robobrain first and then infuse the brain into the robobrain head for 100 of each kind of Stable Flux and your Eternal Soul.

I use the golf course north of vault 76 just walk forward stand on the barrel and get mutated log off/on and get another

We don’t know 1) whether future content will be laid dlc or not, 2) whether future content will break up the player base or not, or 3) whether the revenue stream from cosmetics has a net positive or net negative effect on future content.

What works do you live in?
---
Once I came home and opened my door only to find two glowing ragstags in my living room 😑 they weren’t dead yet
---
In order to persuade someone to do something immoral just convince them they are in a simulation.
---
I lost my jetpack too ..................... What the fuck is wrong with the devs, that like saying oh if you need leather we are going scrap your armor without telling you................................................. Now I got to hunt for a jetpack and I wasn't even server hopping crazy for it I just stumbled upon it............
---
Serious question: how does them duping affect you?
---
it would if Bethesda didn't explicitly forbid such behavior. as far as they're concerned, real currency is a big no-no.
---
unlike *actual* mmos such as EVE, Fo76 will never have a market. the notion itself is silly.
---
Got no clue on what does that have to do with anything, though I’ll answer regardless. No, not even close.
---
No i havent as im console only, im huge fan of ark but no time to be serious player there. I love the brutal level of pvp that brings but im more about gun play than dino power, so rust has always appealed to me for that and other reasons, i may eat my words on this lol i hope bot tho!
---
Worth confirming first though, this is just an observation
---
No problem, let me know when you get back. Thanks 
---
Nope, every last one of them needs either a temp banned or permanent ban from official servers. Bethesda is fixing these issues but these players are out actively hunting for the next exploit when one is discovered. They are focused on abusing bugs; their focus should be diverted to a screen saying they are banned. They have a choice just like we do to abuse the game; they lack self control and maturity.
---
You really need to cut back on the Old Possum. XD
---
What's the best way to farm mutations before starched genes comes into play?   How do you recover from the radiation without losing them?   What tricks are out there?
---
I haven’t done any grinding and I’ve already spent some 1200 atoms earned in-game (I’m lvl 27). I have done a few events more than once, but not because I sought out doing them - I was just in the area when someone else started the event, so I joined in.
---
Belly of the beast
---
Oops. I've been adding recipes to the list as well (with the "Recipe:" prefix). Hope that's ok, looks like a bunch of us are doing that.
---
Go out with pals instead! You'll have one hell of a time.
---
I go days without using my mic. Other days I might toss friendly comments at nearly everyone I come across. Suppose it varies with my mood. Regardless, I've found it useful and entertaining, both. I've found almost exclusively people who are very chill, and sound about my age. Which is to say, college age adults and on up through a couple decades past that. There was one kinda manic guy that was funny in a mildly alarming way, not truly harmful to my gameplay but more like I'd just jumped on the Crazy Train alongside him. A server disconnect inadvertently 'saved' me from that guy maybe 10 minutes after I ran into him. I've found in general that the people that I chat with on voice longest, end up on my friend's list and I wouldn't mind playing with/near them again in the future.  
---
I'm also like you - I wander rather aimlessly and explore and ponder things, read terminals and notes, all that. Also 'only' in my 30s on my one-and-only character, but I don't mind. It's all about how *you* enjoy playing the game. That said, if you want to chill-explore sometime, I'm down. PC, name same as Reddit, I'll try to remember to add you next time I'm ingame.
---
One is enough, I just went and hung out at Vault 76 with a bottle of wine and a whole bunch of Liberators. Happy New Year! 
---
Ok, this is epic
---
Sometimes?
---
Excellent. Gonna try that right meow! 
---
Ps4 &amp; I have the mural too. This build has not eaten eggs or seen the mothman. https://imgur.com/a/ESwThaC
---
He was a bit of a dick
---
Man, I'm glad I'm not the only one doing this..... It feels like such a waste though.
---
Moreover though, do you feel like you're spending most of your time managing your inventory over actually *playing* the game?
---
I just sit in my camp trying to figure out what to trash, what to scrap and what to save..
---
Because I see a lot of curious people asking about the state of the game from others posts so decided to just directly show anyone interested what their getting for their money.
---
I'd suggest looking at your stash and actually do something about it. 
---
I have enough junk to repair/build anything multiple times over, 15-20 pieces of gear, 1k .50 cal ammo AND i sit at 450/600.
---
What are you hoarding? Ammo for guns you dont use? Chems/aid items you'll never use? 
---
Nah I got it down now
---
I know bulking lead and aluminum can reduce your stash weight a bit. Also learn to bulk and sell junk you don’t need. I ALWAYS have a crap ton of cloth (1,000+ at one point). I usually try to keep most of my mats at 250 at most (some exceptions like screws, springs, or other materials that seem like I blow through quick). And things like Black Titanium Scraps can take up quite a bit (1/10 of a pound for Each I think).  I thin that out to around 100. You’ll get the hang of it.
---
TL:DR Learn what you really need and take into account how much everything weighs to keep your Stash light.
---
I gave him 300 caps becuase he ran out 🤦🏼‍♂️ please read 
---
That is for photo mode not for screenshots
---
I see both sides.  What if youve capped 3 workshops and are on for 18 hours(fictional scenario as we know itll server d/c withing a few hours).  Someone should have a chance at being able to use those.  They really do need server options for sure.  PVE/PVP/RP Versions of each also.    My dream, and really the only thing I need out of this game atm, would be mod support, persistent servers, and customizable private server availability.  I know people run the spectrum with love or hate for this game but ive had a blast.
---
This is the most legitimate post on this reddit.
---
I really like how they worked the BoS into this. The way the former military people are looking at the foundations of the brotherhood and going " ... are you fucking serious with me right now?" 
---
It was fucking fantastic writing.
---
I actually saw this person build 8 new heavy machine gun turrets.
---
Holy shit haha didnt think you could have gaming pcs on an oil rig
---
The budget limit is generous if you don't add defenses. Turrets eat about 10% even for the light machineguns
---
Its on an online game so they report on updates lol
---
Fo76 fucked up in a monumental scale, it's only natural that people are still in awe over how bad this particular dumpster fire really was.
---
I mean, Atlas was probably worse, but its budget was a fraction of Fo76's. no to mention people expect better of a triple A company. much, much better than what they delivered with 76.
---
and it's universally agreed upon that 1 and 2 are better games than 3 and 4. universally is a strong word though, since there are lots of players younger than the first Fallout itself that started with 3
---
Your opinion does not matter go back to youtube
---
On Xbox you can join them from the people tab &gt; friends &gt; join, and not have to go through the trouble of going past the main menu
---
I would love for them to get that purifier thing fixed, and that animation from fo4 for the rifle too. But I would rate those lower on a priority list than duping.
---
I'll keep playing because I still find it fun, but when it comes to rampant cheating that crashes servers, it is something in the back of my mind that stinks. 
---
Ruining it? They will just move camp and that same bag will be there again. It's stored at least twice if not multiple times and copies each time they do the dupe. Nothing lost. Nothing ruined. In your stupid face!
---
How do I instigate the mistress of mysteries quest line ?
---
how much for the smg?
---
Great way to let everyone do whatever they want.....it affects almost nothing lorewise....therefore can easily coexist with single player games and be canon
---
Then you get deluged by his slim jim scream spamming.
---
That's from their stored. 
---
They can't craft or place anything new.
---
It ruins the trading market, the legitimacy of anything in the game, it causes lag via huge inventories of items being spawned in which is know causes for server crashing, it ruins the difficulty of the game for everyone, and it is bannable offense on nearly every single multiplayer game on the internet.  
---
Yeah, let me sit down in a chair, reduce the decay of thirst and hunger, and just let me play my damned pipboy holotape games &gt;8C
---
Aaah you know what I mean.
---
Ohh I have a ton of turrets 
---
I rarely use youtube, If you have a better video sharing site, please let me know.
---
Every online service ever should have 2FA.  Either phone software or physical authenticators like they have for WOW.  It would be great if someone would build a physical authenticator that could work with many different services. (not sure thats even possible)
---
Totally. Well definitely add me if you want. I've been wearing my mic all day today but of course haven't run across anyone yet lol. 
---
Jason Borne, that's Jesus Christ!
---
Man, paper would be cool. We could post notes, or leave them at camps. Like, a mailbox would be cool.
---
Professional noob here ;-)
---
It's all about what you make with them.
---
Couldn't people already theoretically do that since that's only 45 points? They'd still have 5 points to spare in other categories, not to mention the extra 6 through other means.
---
I like this much salt on my chicken. Not about pvp. 
---
So, unless it's changed, it is very brutal. 
---
The servers get wiped often because the game often involves the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. Essentially if you create a character on a server, your character is ever lasting on said server until a wipe occurs. You and your base are persistent (similar to ARK) I suppose. 
---
The problem with this design is that, more than likely, the people that win are the ones that play exhorbanently as they are able to attack you and your base both when you are on and offline. In addition to this, there is absolutely nothing off limits in this game. So, when you are killed and your base is destroyed, you drop everything and your spawn and your base can and usually will go along with it. 
---
I've tried to enjoy the experience personally, but in the end it becomes difficult to do so because it felt that Everytime I logged in I was starting over from scratch and unable to compete with(or just be nearby) powerful groups on said server. 
---
I'm interested to see how exactly this works in FO76 and if they can find a way to balance both griefing and the inability to attack someone if they log off. 
---
You're using the wrong perk card. Fix it good is for PA I think.
---
Just a joke lol
---
Don’t read gaming articles, most of the time it’s someone who was ordered to write about a certain game and put in a few hours unwillingly. As an example here’s a headline I saw “mobile game ark survival evolved is great but what it really needs is crossplay with other platforms” these people will write anything to just have written something. 
---
Meh, in theory its nuts but the time and effort to do it is nuts too.
---
All for a tacked on side attraction to a pve game.
---
I've only heard about this build here and never seen it in game and probably never will.
---
And even if i do i never carry junk anyways so its not like it matters
---
To try to take over the world of course.  Oh wait - different Brain
---
Thanks for informing me! I don't play the game but was interested in how it affects other players. I didn't realize they had a trade market! That's pretty dope and I definitely understand the lag issues. Thanks again.
---
It's a rare spawn chance, like how some places have ghouls/super mutants/scorched
---
Are you on PS4? If so, I can rebuild your shower for you (With 2⭐ Contractor), or provide the materials for you to do so yourself.
---
Maybe it will? It's still Dec 31 in the US.
---
If you look though there's at least 15 turrets in this screenshot
---
you are everything wrong with the modern gamer. 
---
I’ve seen high int work but haven’t tested powersmith myself. I don’t think Armorer applies to power armor. Repairing to 200% with fix it good works pretty well.
---
Thank you so much, I appreciate that!
---
Thisnisnxt about PVP. What are you going to do when someone destroys your entire base and follows you constantly then you might feel the gripe. Especially considering the next big update is PVP focused, its literally adding fuel to a dumpster fire. 
---
Get what your trying to say but it isn't really earning anything when its based on luck and rng, just saying. Two people can work on killing the same legendary, one gets a decent drop the other gets a nocturnal rolling pin.
---
Bye 
---
This particular camp is clearly a glitched mess of exploit. I was just answering the question of how it could be possible
---
This is a screenshot of a ghoul before it loaded in, so this is a baited post. Once it loads in it’s fine.
---
Sorry to answer your question with another question, and possibly stupid question, but how do you look at the list of challenges?
---
Dude trust me I'm far from an incel and I fully accept the fact that i'm in this position because of myself and no one else. This wasnt really a 'woe is me the world has made me sad and the cause of my depression is everyones fault but my own' and more just kinda something to be funny for people in the same boat. Maybe just to let some other people who are alone tonight know they're not the only ones
---
I think there can be different kinds of markets. I don't think anyone would deny that there were people making real money farming gold in WoW, even though you couldn't buy gold directly with $. 
---
Just because they don't buy it directly from bgs doesn't mean there is no economy. 
---
Who needs to take your junk when they can destroy your base? And considering there is even a reddit marketplace for 76, this can easily be bought. Play a couple hours, get some caps, buy the stuff. Boom.
---
Open the map, if on console l1 or lb and then scroll down to challenges 
---
How is this a baited post? You clearly see me walk slowly up to the ghoul, even faced it then shot it. It takes 15+ seconds for a ghoul to load in?
---
To build a rideable scorchbeast
---
Haha I would but they're all with their own SOs, hence my dilemma
---
One is fine. I had one bottle of Blackwater brew while levelling up and that worked. Managed to get event done as well on same bottle as I was doing event while levelling. 
---
I actually had 2 but the first wore off before I levelled.
---
I have same issue. I thinks it's a bug
---
Oh. Those were easy to port.
---
To be fair, any number of things could be setup for the future.
---
So no fix?
---
Not hard just boring.  I've killed 2 sorch beasts at level 45, and never want to kill any more if I don't need to, it's such a slog for so littel reward I have zero interest in doing it again.
---
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH THATS WHAT THEY WERE DOING!! I just thought it was like sitting in the mens room and tapping your foot towards the next stall so I didnt say anything on my mic and went about my business elsewhere.  Now I know. And knowing is half the battle.
---
Brahmin give you fertilizer the plan is under resources
---
Thanks sir
---
I think it might be a bug in how the game interfaces with the system firmware. it's specifically any time I unplug and then re-plug my charging cable while something is loading. crashes almost without fail, very reproducibly. trouble is, my charging port is going, and any minute movement (e.g. I uncross my legs) makes it disconnect momentarily. I need to get it fixed but it also really really shouldn't be making the game crash.
---
Yeah, Ive found a couple at that little house between the observation tower and radio tower N of Flatwoods (the one with the pool table).
---
Wow...
---
Bro Happy new year that made my night! Have yourself and upvote and +karma.
---
Old enough to ride my bike across town to play "Space Invaders" at the pizza place. We had a free Coleco Telstar hooked up to the 11" B&amp;W portable in the basement. I am ashamed to say that I pirated Wasteland from a BBS while in college and also pirated FO1 from Usenet some years later.
---
lol "I don't see the problem so it doesn't exist"
---
Sorry u bought a terrible game.
---
Prepare to kill your self...  a lot. Especially around feral ghouls.  
---
Yea me too dude, thanks for the compliment.
---
It's also in Lucky Hole Mine where there is a creepy underground church where you can get that sword OP has and there is a hidden chamber with a sleeping cthulhu/tree god in it. 
---
Some additional info here, too.
---
Anyone else encounter this last night around 1 AM EST? https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ab14pz/anyone_else_encounter_this_last_night_around_1_am/
---
Have you tamed a hermit crab or atleast do you know if it’s possible 
---
I'd agree to have it added to the game as something you can earn but it cant go to the atom shop since that is for cosmetics only.
---
Same
---
 No. Forever reclamation day.... and the day after. 
---
I like the Responder Paramedic outfit, with gasmask. I change the hat a lot, it's a military one right now. I need to get the bathrobe as that was my outfit of choice in FO4.
---
I've seen it occur, myself, and the condition you're suggesting makes sense, but could be challenging to replicate...
---
That said, it would explain the ScorchBeast "Full heal" I've seen, as they will stop fighting with me to engage a Deathclaw for example, and the next thing I know it's fully healed.
---
This is embarrassing. 
---
I’d hop server. Seriously I’m so tired of people bitching about this game. You literally wrote the answer in your tirade, throw a Molotov or grenade at them. Fallout always had bugs and I walked around king shit of FO4 one shotting everything I wanted and can pretty much do that in FO76 as well. Now all of a sudden people get to compete with each other and the game sucks and it’s the worst. Wah wah wah play a different game then. 
---
Added with some edits, credit given
---
No mods. I did set the game's priority to High in the task manager and through my GPU settings I set a profile for FO76 to force the game to use my graphics card instead of the integrated graphics chip. In that profile I also set the game's Power Management Mode to Prefer Maximum Performance and set Max Pre-rendered Frames to 4.
---
I gotta say, I was a little worried that public servers wouldn't feel quite right for Fallout, but I think they've actually got the number of players per server/map set at a pretty good level. Go into a place with vendors and workbenches, you find people more often. But out in the woods or mountains? Not much at all! Just about perfect.
---
Where did you get that? I had one lvl 21 from the mire,but the same mire was too much for him to handle and i had to move my camp to somwhere safer. 
---
not sure if someone has mentioned this or not but you can take damage right after entering the incapacitated mode (the mode when you have the option to be revived) so two shot weapons or weapons that do continues damage will always instant kill the player. eg assaultron laser can incapacitate you and then kill you strait after before it turns of its laser. this removes the point of being able to be revived after dying and In my opinion you should only take damage from player melee hits while incapacitated making pvp more interesting.
---
That's not how pre-orders work, man. They needed an incentive for people to pre-order so they said "here's these things no one else will have besides other people who pre-ordered." So they can't offer an upgrade for it, at least not for a while, but it may be included in a later version
---
Right? Apparently it was my Imgur cakeday a couple days ago. WHOOPS. 
---
I don't care if people don't think its a good game they still have already voiced their opion about it and dont want to see them circle jerk the subject. Also it is a game from almost two months ago not a week ago so there is no reason for how youtubers and articles continue to circle jerk.
---
Idk 34 felt good. Although I always mix up numbers. It's either 14 24 or 34. Your numbers don't go past 30ish.
---
Garments don’t weigh much, though. 
---
I had them spawn literally ALL diseased glowing ones 58+ in whitespring. There was no nuke launch and they dropped legendaries.
---
Geenades are equally as useless if not even more. I just don't think you're reading anything and instead are basing yourself off a single player game that doesnxt have mechanics that are switched when in PVP mode. 
---
Glad to know I’m not the only one with the phantom purifier! Ugh!
---
Main problem is that there is no end game content at all for high level players. Some of them are already so frustrated that they just spend their time by harassing other low level players.
---
Full set of dense robot armor reduces explosive damage to almost nothing so, there ya go.
---
I have a SO... and he’s playing PubG. So FO76 for me!
---
You can if you make 3D models for a living 😀
---
Most often it's because they're considered "in combat" (eg agro'd) to another player
---
I'll take the SMG, 2000 caps sound good?
---
Yes i def understand rust is like ark in many aspects. Ive stayed hidden for weeks solo and living small on ark. Ive raided and been raided. I rarely destroy all of ppls stuff or steel all their stuff as its pointless and straight uo fuckin mean.  i takes what i needs. I wish pvp in fallout was a bit more involved and hell i jis wish it happened more often. This game could be made very similar to rust or ark rather as almost all elements are present now. And yes i am too curious to see how this pans out with the pvp updates and such. Im on ps4 btw if you or anyone wants to team up or fight me with some good ole pvp im ready!! I love the fallout universe and 76 is fun for me, i hope you enjoy it too!!
---
Don't know why you got down voted ,I love my 2 shot explosive weapons but they need to keep them as far away from the new PvP mode as possible. Maybe have us create new characters for said mode ,and the explosive legendary effect simply isn't available in the mode
---
the fact it's not officially endorsed puts a huge dent on the profitability itself. not many people would farm caps/legendaries knowing it's against the ToS. it worked for WoW because it has an infinitely larger playerbase.
---
besides, the important thing is that Fo76 is simply not a mmo. would you consider Dark Souls a mmo? or better yet, do you think SAMP should have a "healthy market"? SAMP is short for San Andreas MultiPlayer, btw. a dirty mod that allows for, well, multiplayer. that's essentially what 76 is, Fo4 with online enabled.
---
and even more important, Bethesda is not competent enough to have a functional market. ESO worked because it's its own thing. gamebryo has way too many bugs to allow for a market.
---
I did mine with a few bottles of Old Possum and the Soylent Green event.  That pretty much took care of the event and robots and about half of the needed creatures.  Still needing the level up one, hard to time it right - whats the longest lasting chem/liquor?
---
Yeah this happened to me yesterday! Then I went to the glassed cavern and there were no scorched... only liberator commie bots 
---
The exact reason i have never bought an item directly off a player or legendaries from a vendor

---
Thanks for the advice.  I used it as a starting point so try something out.
---
Every game gets worse with griefing.  Once you have done almost everything people get bored and just mess about.  Also once the everybodys in the same boat learning phase runs off, people become more hostile.
---
I would also accept the Super Mutant loudly proclaiming "Bong".
---
😭😭😭
---
Yes, this game has builds.
---
&gt; it is a game from almost two months ago not a week ago so there is no reason for how youtubers and articles continue to circle jerk.
---
It is a game from today. And it still merits criticism. Welcome to live services.
---
Whats the best for a stealth/rifle build?
---
Torquemada75 same working dad but a bit higher level. Had a bunch of time off and used a bunch of sleepless nights to get lvl 90something 
---
They can but they don't as you're too gimped going that route.
---
5 pts across 3 specials is tough.
---
With 25 more points no decisions are involved. 
---
Not really a way to automate it since they could easily all be in different servers.  basically the lot of you would need to decide on qa party leader, then all join their server.
---
Keep this thread going, especially after you find the flamer again!
---
Call of Duty and/or Battlefields of the yesteryears had dedicated servers and peer-to-peer hosting, so they didn't have a technical upkeep except for the anti-piracy servers that checked to make sure you had a valid license to the game. 
---
They also started DLCs during the same era, starting as far back as Battlefield: Bad Company 2 (Vietnam DLC) and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (Variety map pack). 
---
And then, both EA and Activision were pushing to increase the standard MSRP of games from $49.99 to $59.99.

So in the span of 3-5 years starting from 2006 or so, the game industry increased the price of games, started offering DLCs, and also offloaded server costs to the users via peer-to-peer multiplayer hosting. So it may be difficult to ascertain whether or not devs/publishers were eating the cost of upkeep or passing the upkeep cost to the user during this time.
---
Not saying you're wrong on any particular point, nor support the game industry for doing what they do in regards to micro-transactions/DLC. Just clarifying that the upkeep costs/etc for shooter franchises has changed quite dramatically over the years, so it may be hard to make the direct comparison between those examples you listed and an online RPG like FO76.

I strongly believe that if you will randomly achieve it, you will love it instantly.

This is a wasteland survival game. Im not suggesting abusing its mechanics (server hops) Im suggesting using them to their full extent (to unlock its most fun elements). The increased manevourability is in my observation the single strongest part of my character, and that was my point - I dont see this as reason to insult anybody and that was not my plan, I just wanted to share what I believe is piece of strategic information.
---
You too :)

Really bro, guess you must be new to Fallout or gaming in general if a bug like this breaks you; T posing is a bug found in alot of games over the years. I rarely see this bug and I'm over 270 hours in plus this is Morgantown which is generally the lagiest spot in the entire game.
---
Sure why not. If you need some, i can make you a marine wetsuit, improved version.
---
Its a build but not even a fair kind. Usually builds have negative effects to them. This seems like a build where the only thing that can be done is a literal nuke.
---
Yeah Fallout 76 fucked up on a monumental scale. But how many ways can you say that? Apparently an unlimited number of ways I guess.  I just find it bizarre. 
---
You just summed up the problem with Fallout 76 in one sentence. 
---
Youtubers,  writers,  etc. keep saying it in 500 plus word articles and 20 minute long youtube videos. 
---

You have to mark 10 bunnies. I didn't bother to finish though
---
You have to reclear it, even if you rejoin Server. Player enters Server and visits any Location, mob respawn.
---
The thing that sucks is sometimes your forced to interact with dumbasses or PVP when you didn't realize.
---
First time I ever got wanted was an accident I was in Whitesprings, and got horded by ghouls.  I was circle kiting them and accidentally tagged someones house that was set up on  the greens.  So I got a 20 cap wanted notice.  Wasn't trying to hit it didn't realize i was anywhere near it.  Hadn't turned on Pascifist as I didn't even realized I needed to.
---
Got kacked by a level 100+ in PA and a super sledge who stole all my junk I was trying to unload and sell at the WS station.  Kinda pissed.
---
Second was me being level 25-30 don't remember exactly and some dumbass lowbies running after me plinking away with slap damage while I'm trying to finish up a quest that took me near one of the towns close to flatwoods.
---
Anyway after aobut 20 minutes of bad emoting them and making it clear I didn't want to fight they finally left.  I didn't need or want that shit but they just wouldn't go away.  I finally dragged them into areas with higher level stuff that would munch on them  But it was fucking annoying as hell.
---
I heard that it's pellet, if I'm wrong then 2 shot is def worth it
---
That's really cool hopefully it's not a one off thing though.
---
Hard to say, but what it looks like is that it spawns a random Excavator mod. I got emergency protocols.
---
You could not sound any more salty / jealous. 
---
There are rabbits in game?
---
I was powerbuild pistolero until I got TSE shotgun which, without any perks, made my old build obsolete. Level 157 now.
---
Still available to make a set?
---
Yes it will.
---
Range is your guns range. 
---
Shoot the wings.
---
Beware, enforcer trivializes most of the game
---
True they need an incentive to pre order.  But it wasn't even much of one really.  Just a few skins for an extra 20 bucks.  The PA edition straight up broke the law and the game was released in a beta state at best.
---
I love the game.  Have over 200 hours so far and despite it flaws I can put up.  The issue is I actually pre-ordered on xbox but cancelled it after playing the demo before it released.  
---
I knew it was coming down in price and was right.  I'm glad I didn't keep the preorder otherwise I wouldn't have saved almost half the cost.  
---
Buddy marked lightning bugs and said they got some random loot. Nothing special. 
---
Oh I know it was but I am sure he didn't see it that way :P
---
Have SO, but also have three kids. 
---
Oof. Maybe some other kind soul will be able to provide the materials to rebuild your shower should you need to scrap it.
---
this is good habit - also insert your lowest charged fusion core before logging out so it can get fully charged next time you log in. 
---
Luck only affects the condition of loot. High luck characters have the same chance for "good" loot as a 1 luck character. That's not a bug, it is working as intended.
---
Yesss, I sure am. I’m not around my console due to the holiday, but I can make one for you and try and get it to you tomorrow?
---
How do u get the long coat
---
All great! 
---
When I was low leveled I used to lock my purifiers but now I just welcome people to my place and don't care if they grad some.
---
Nope, they should never let items that give you an advantage be in the Atom Store; ice cold drinks give a huge boost of positives. Now if they added the ability for fridge related buildables to do the same I would say go for it.
---
Yeah same for me on the locations. Some say I haven't discovered any when I have. For the forest area I need to discover an area I have already discovered to complete it.
---
You probably got hit with a TSE handmade or shotgun.  Craploads of damage in a single shot and more than enough to rip open somebody's power armor.  The armor itself would take a ton of damage as well.
---
So, why is it worth having the plan for the .44 Pistol anyway?
---
I did that the other day with speed demon I was depressed I just got used to the new move speed 
---
Then employ someone over the holidays.  I have worked in industries where I've works Xmas day and over New years.  They can't hide behind that excuse.
---
It would be nice, but certain things wouldn’t make sense, like certain vault dwellers coming out of the vault TWO MONTHS after reclamation day
---
You need the full set
---
Don't get me wrong, I kinda like the way they put them in too, but they should have just called them the brotherhood
---
Full suit
---
Pretty sure when you face shot a moleman it makes a satisfying crunch

Its really better than chainsaw/ripper, somehow i modded with that armor piercer and ...  now im able to \*drill (pun intended) to about 2nd enemy in front of me :) frag me, right? :D

PvP is already neutered in this game. Can't complain about PvP when your in an activity that warns you that PvP is possible while doing it. If you don't want to PvP stay away from workshops, or capture then the first time for the reward and then leave them. 
---
Not saying this to be unsympathetic, I understand that PvP isn't for everyone, and hopefully these faction wars will give the PvP wanting players an outlet, but honestly this games PvP is practically nonexistent. You had a bad experience, no reason to let it get to you. 
---
Hmmm, well it was something I noticed when getting in and out of power armor. I have 10 perk STR, but only 9 when you look at it due to mutations. My PA was giving me +3 STR, and I noticed that my 200% chainsaw was adding damage relative to the amount of STR gained from my PA. 
---
Maybe the interaction is as specific as PA bumps it up, or maybe it is STR. I'll have to do some more testing as well it seems to fully flesh out what is going on with this one. 
---
If you Bethesda people read this, please don't get all butthurt and stop reading after the first paragraph because you thinks it's a "Hate Post". Or because you don't like what I'm saying. There are things I genuinely like about this game. The first time I launched a Nuke, I did it solo. And I took like 5 pictures with the in-game camera mode (nice touch btw😎) because it was a glorious 4k UHD sight to behold. It's just.... Right now the bad outweighs the good.😟
---
1. PC
---
2. Tunerbuilder
---
3. No screenshot for you!!😂
---
4. Nerfd fusion core availability/lack of end-game content (But really, it's the lack of NPCs that pushed me away) and overall I'm generally disappointed by this game😞
---
5. Support ticket...😆
---
Alright. So I've officially stopped playing fo76 and went back to fo4 until you people get your **** together and release some new content worthy of the prestige FO4 had. (Also, keep in mind users would rather pay for dlcs of high quality, than have free poorly designed content). It's gotten quite boring walking around and, "exploring" (really just wandering around aimlessly wasting resources since I've mapped the whole of WV in-game and camps are very restrictive in how big you can build them) Buildable settlements would have been very cool for literally hours on end of enjoyment. Aswell as companions and buildable robots. But you can't have settlements or companions if THERE AREN'T ANY NPC'S!!!!   😡
---
"Of course, you can play this solo". Hah! Todd Howard your hilarious! Sure, you can go it solo, quest by yourself, launch a nuke by yourself (Not as hard as people think), take on the scorched Queen by yourself-ish (soloing her is nearly impossible to attempt because of the people that flock to the event due to a world wide notification). But man is it empty and boring after the main story line is completed (because there aren't any human NPCs as noted earlier!!!). I completed the main quest in 10 days averaging around 5 hours a day. After that it was like, "despite all the bugs that was kinda fun, but now what". Everything else after that feels like a grind, the events, world hopping to get a rare item(because having a boss that drops them every time or a quest to get the item is too mainstream!!), launching a nuke, and the scorched queen. 😒
---
And all this must be done in a survivor type fashion from PVE, PVM(which is fine), and annoyingly --&gt; PVP (which is not fine), which works best or sometimes only with power armour. Good thing there aren't any OP Mr. Gutsy robots. OH WAIT THERE ARE, and they can spawn in SWARMS!!!! Because I love to be killed by a swarm of 7 ridiculously OP robots; while trying to defend a power plant for a lousy 1 FC per hour!!!!! It's impractical to get more than 1-3 every hour, since you people went overboard with the nerfing of the FC extractors and general availability. It doesn't help that the jetpack tears through fusion cores at an ungodly rate of 1 core/10 minutes, if I'm in the mountains or a large city trying to jump around. They were too easy to get before, I agree. But 3/hour with all three bugged power plants captured (assuming you don't get disconnected) is absolutely ridiculous!!! I went from having around 30 at all times, to struggling to keep 3 on me all in the space of a week because of the nerfd availability. Either you spend caps fast travelling around and hope someone hasn't grabbed them before you, or you server hop for hours trying to find some before someone else grabs them. YAY  😡
---
There is no reason why I should get disconnected so frequently with my hardwired fibre optic internet connection with an 175gbps internet speed.  No one should get disconnected from one of your servers with less than 15 players present and not a single blast zone on the map. The only reason is that you hired the wrong people to build and maintain your servers. OR you didn't actually test them properly before bringing them online.   😡  (yes, another angry face. Because this is ridiculous)
---
So, back to FO4 I went. The game I have spent over a thousand hours playing, because you guys got the formula spot on. Despite the issues, I still love it. Unlike FO76. This game should have been with NPCs, then there could be settlments and companions. And the perks based on perk points (not apoints that max at 14 per S.P.E.A.C.I.A.L catagory and at 50 points total, that's absurd). It's sad, because FO76 has so many great additions that FO4 was lacking. A giant new map with loads of excellent lore potential, more realistic weather patterns, graphics tweaks, a gripping story line (too short, but still a good story), new monsters, updated guns, and (My favourite part) repeatable nuke launching. 😍
---
If you people had combined those attributes with some of FO4's base game framework (lvling system, workshops, workbenches/stations, weapons/armour build/modding without plans, companions, and the settlement system) it would have been just as epic as we were lead to believe at the E3 conference this past year.
---
But instead you rushed, overhyped, and left unfinished what could have been game of the year. 😔
---
That is all! 😉
---
Yeah but its release date wasn't today or a week ago. I didn't say it was immune from criticism but there is no reason for all the articles and videos still coming out about it because its not like it has gotten worse or had no improvement because it has had a lot of improvements. Its start had a lot of problems and it made sense for articles to come out. However, its still getting them which just goes to show people are just hating to hate on it ,not to report on it.
---
They always seem to have caps, maybe Grahm is slowly domesticating them.

Morgantown High School has a ton of plastic. The gym is full of plastic pumpkins and bowling pins. If you loot the whole place you'll get quite a bit.
---
The Grafton Monster in the aqueduct by Charleston Station drops acid and is pretty easy to kill if you're a higher level. Snallygasters in cranberry bog do too but take longer to find and kill.
---
I bought these.  Good fair price for a few outfits and a hat, though should be around 600.  None of this 1800 for a skin crap.
---
You rarely encounter this? That's a bold statement. I see this several times within 2 hours of playing in various areas. I will gladly make a montage just for you and anyone else needing reinforcement on this. Look at my edit before you even posted, I'm a huge Fallout fan, So no I'm not new to Fallout or gaming in general. You're also assuming this was the ONLY thing that got me. Did you even read the post? Probably not. I mentioned the game looks like garbage and even runs like garbage on Ultra with an 8GB GTX 1080. i7 8 threaded CPU. I've been monitoring the Bethesda forums closely and almost every update has "Performance and stability fixes" in there, So they at least acknowledge the game isn't running well. I made another video one time as well, Of the HUGE shadow distance and load distance problems, where shadows will blatantly pop in and out constantly right in front of you. I want this game to succeed but it won't unless people voice up about it's problems. Don't even get me started on the smudged ass textures.
---
It was the same for me, i would have taken the colored lights for 500 but the whole bundle for 2k, no way. Honestly i don't really understand why they didnt just add the items seperately as well.
---
I think you need to grab their wrist and raise their hand, and then they do the same for you. 
---
Of course they will.  Your complaining about people complaining.  Which is worse.
---
Good luck to you!

Yup, even true with the radawau effect of decontamination arches. Lost 2 of them

---
Mmmh.. *Brain* meat!
---
How about you just stop and do what you said you were going to do and just shelve the game. This isn't a healthy way to spend new year's. Nobody cares about your cause.
---
So many people roll over to the Golf course when a nuke drops , it’s easy to see how the game is nerfed. 
---
If you don't like pvp, farm some led and gun powder and take the double production perks, its much faster anyway.
---
This guy lmfao. What did he think people were going to say... "WOW dude what a badass!".. lmfao.

Doesn't lead to anything, In fact i don't quite know if i got a reward from it either.

Why?
---
Join the two big community pages and you can join groups that way. I've had some good luck with randoms there so far.
---
Have you got rid of all your duplicate plans/recipes? Unlike other items in the Notes section they're quite heavy. Dump them in bags for newbies or leave them in tools at vendors. Don't stash food/chems, you don't drop them when you die so you may as well carry them with you and have the perks to reduce their weight. Check your gunpowder, it's in Misc instead of junk. Get Marsupial mutation for an extra 20 carry weight. 
---
Yeah the armor peircer is long. It's basically the dragon piercer from monster hunter. Hold the trigger and run into battle. I did do wotaga highschool candy mission with the chainsaw and was super happy. The stagger is anoyying when you are getting hit a lot. But it deals so much stagger on it's own that once you get the weapon pointed and running, your a killing machine. 
---
At the very least they need to add a messaging system to the launcher so we can DM friends. 
---
Okay, sounds good to me! Thanks. I've been trying to get it to spawn all day. I'll be sure to save you a donation 
---
For calling out a company that’s making dumbass mistakes and not blindly loving them like a shill? And who calls themselves a gamer? A cringey weirdo like you, that’s who.

Yes, you're looking for the "through wall" conduit. Horizontal middle part can go through walls. Personally, I just use windows and feed the wires through them.

Stephen Knight strikes again...
---
 No problem! Happy new year!
---
NOOOOOOOO
---
&gt;its not like it has gotten worse or had no improvement because it has had a lot of improvements
---
This statement makes no sense. Improving something that is bad doesn't make it good.
---
&gt;However, its still getting them which just goes to show people are just hating to hate on it ,not to report on it.
---
Or that the random 'improvements' have not redeemed the game? Would you expect bad reviews of a restaurant's food to stop if they made the decor nicer?
---
Same to you!
---
Thanks

I connected my fusion generator to a conduit outside my house then put another one inside it and connected that one to the shower, no power. What am i doing wrong? the lights seem to work

Only if you have a 30 power rated wire with a 50 amp breaker
---
The game is shelved as of 30 min before this post. I'm not particularly upset that I'm responding to people but it seems its making others upset that I posted this about their game. My new years isn't being ruined by commenting on reddit while I'm waiting for a game to update. But it seems I'm ruining other peoples night by bringing this up and that alone is enough to make me stop then. I'm sorry for ruining everyone's night by bringing this up. I just hate that a lot of people might actually be planning this game to purchase for a mini new years break on gaming and will be sorely disappointed.

---
This is a good idea

Right, so you didn't fall for the pre-order trap. But you can't have your cake and eat it too, the pre-order skins have to be the carrot on the stick

They reset in the inventory but the words on the wall didnt change for us. We tested, and the codes from last week worked.

Oh you know they cannot disable that. I want they rebalanced that kind of guns

Atom shop had you covered.
---
The trade option was there to trade and sales with friends and others in your area. I don’t think that System was made with an intention of a mass market economy. If the really had the intention of a mass market Capitalist economy then they would have include a in game mass trading system and board Market Place IE a trading post in game where you posted items.
---
Instead we took the Mechanics of the game and created a black market Capitalist market place through other Social Media avenues.
---
To answer do I believe that black market economy has been hurt by duping. It has drove prices down enough that all items are available to all players at a cheaper price. The Market about 70% was Controlled by a lot of small groups who have been duping since the game came out and they was charging top dollar and slowly putting things out to sale to control the market.  
---
What end up happening more people learn how to dupe and they flood the market with items. Used to be a TSE Handmade or Pump went for 10-20K Caps Each. Then the renegade dupers started selling them for 1-3k each. It drove the price down and it Feed a high demand. So it made the black market a truly a free market. Though it might have hurt some Individual sellers it undermine the corrupt groups that was trying to control the market.
---
Plus the Value and how much Fallout76 can be a free market and Capitalistic is already capped. You can only have 25K Caps at a time per Character. So already your in a controlled structure. Lending Credence that we don’t have a Full Market And Economy supported in game.
---
That cover resources and everything else. The Question Or Idea of a Market being stable is ridiculous. A market will always go up and down, ebb and flow. The Only way a market stays Stable is if it’s manipulated and controlled.
---
As the question of server bug and instability of the servers is something to be more upset about. That is a separate situation the complaining about TSE guns and a player created market.

Thought about it, reluctant to spend the atoms though. 
---
clean clown costume has been datamined, so it's likely to be in the atomshop at some point.

The idea is nice but 50~100 atom per kit won't make sense since some clean version of existing outfits in the game are already in the atomshop for ~800 atoms.

You can, and should, consult a site like [nukesdragons.com](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) to see which cards become available at which level. The bonus packs might be random, but the selection of cards you can pick at any given level are not.

‘Enclave’?  Never heard of it.  My unit (what’s left of us) are the sole surviving officers in the US Army in West Virginia.  It’s been hard, but we have managed to reestablish security along highways between Flatwoods and Morgantown.  We have food, supplies, and bedding for 40 men and a fortress with walls 5” thick on the East side of Lake Summersville.  We are the US Army.

Absolutely. I'm not against PvP at all; in fact, I like it. But the way it is at this moment... there's just no way I could have done anything to prevent him to take that workshop.
---
&gt; You STOLE someone's stuff and became Wanted.
---
Did he though?
---
That workshop comes with locked doors and a safe. They're part of the world and not placed by a player.
---
Any safe or container placed by a player is just a basic stash box. The items in that safe does not belong to anyone, unless they put items in them which would despawn on a server crash/restart.
---
The owner of a workshop can literally remove locked doors they themselves cannot open, as well as any containers that might hold items.
---
There is therefore zero expectancy of ownership of any item in a container.

Kind of. The vendors all belong to different factions and share their caps so if you sell stuff to a member of a faction, all other members of that faction will have the same amount of caps.

  Some of the factions, like the Firebreathers, Responders, Free States, BOS and Raiders have their own quest lines as well.

Yes, because criticism of this game is so deeply hidden nobody doing a simple Google search would ever... EVER find anyone giving this game a shitty review.

It doesnt have to be 3 star at all. The armor just needs assassin skill on the armor, the others are all perk cards. Can literally grind white springs as armor shows up more than weapons anyways.

Thanks, I should have just left as soon as he destroyed my turrets I’ll keep that in mind next time. It just pissed me off so much because I didn’t do anything and was just getting destroyed for no reason. 
---
Welcome to explosive weapons.
---
No need to report
---
If you're xbox, I have a lvl 50 autogrenade with 50% armor and 50% limb damage. Also 455 40mm. The launcher does 249 with max explosive perk.
---
It’s amazing how someone can write so much about a video game but I can’t write a 5 paragraph English paper
---
You sure about that? I have to admit I've never tried to lock a workshop terminal (are there any others besides that one?), but I've only seen locks allowed on doors and resource gatherers.
---
oh fuck I have like ten of those succulents
---
i hope they don't get destroyed? why do those even have a health bar??
---
Similar experience 
---
The ones you absolutely need you can't drop. And yes, all holotapes respawn where you originally found them.
---
So are you doing a big giveaway now ;)
---
I would take some mutation serums from you.
---
I lock my doors and junk extractor, if anyone glitches into my camp using a bench from though the window, they'll get stuck inside and be forced to appreciate the effort I put in my camp.
---
The evil part is enemies occasionally get stuck in the ground, good luck fast traveling out.
---
I don't know because I suck(ed) at it.  Finally I just bought the serums I wanted.
---
As the other person stated, use the wall pass through conduit.  
---
If they are connected then no power will flow. 
---
No I’m on PS4 
---
Platform?
---
Ps4, xbox or pc?
---
Something else I noticed was that if that certain legendary enemies didn’t drop something I may actually find legendaries on non legendary enemies, kinda strange but it happens. 
---
Not alive after i paased through there
---
So the 50 version doesn’t do that much more?
---
I hoped I wouldn't have to point out the irony of you calling me presumptuous when you decided I would say something in reply and then call me wrong for something you decided I would say lol.  It's New year's man, have a happy one.  Here's to a better next year for you bud.
---
Upvoting for content but also just for a great photo! 11/10 for holiday lights in the background;-)
---
Maybe the MMO for Bethesda is many members online
---
Haters gonna hate.
---
Well, a lot of survival open worlds have designated pvp servers, so the idiots can kill each other and leave everyone else alone. Wish we had that already. And the bounty system doesn’t do shit to stop griefing. Do I need to mention that people in pacifist can still die even if they don’t want to do pvp? Lmao, it’s just getting worse 
---
Maybe just like a finger?
---
Oops! Xbox One

I'm not saying the game is the greatest I'm talking about how it gets circle jerked for views and you are just taking my comments out of context and not listening about my point. I'm tired of people making articles and videos for views when they have already made an opinion. If you are a critic you dont review a restraint  you already reviewed before. It annoys me that there is media still bashing it when they have made their opinion on the game already and keep making them for content. Despite their opinion not changing.
---
Yes the game isn't the best optimized just like Fallout 4 (No big surprise there, I knew it would be like that in large cities) and so far Morgantown is the only place that lags for me. I only play on medium shadows and shadow distance though because that is where the lag usually stems from and I don't care much about graphics; everything else is on ultra. I've never seen the smudged texture issue in 76 but I've seen videos on it and have experienced it on Fallout 4; it's an LOD issue where the distance doesn't load in properly. Outside of graphical issues that are 99% fixed by lowering two settings there isn't much in the way of stopping you from playing the game through till the end.
---
Ok
---
Ah.. sorry friend, I'm PS4
---
Go check the subreddits and get back to me.
---
Hell you should be able to put it together in a couple of hours right?
---
Put your theory into practice.
---
I've built doors in all the doorways and locked them - my goal was more to prevent hordes from getting inside. At first I thought they always spawned outside and only got in if there was a way, but that doesn't seem to be the case.
---
People seem to forget that the large stairs near the offices up front are open to the inside if you don't fix that door in the front of the building. Dropping some cement security walls around the gaps like the loading dock and the holes in the walls is pretty much necessary if you want to close that place up.
---
Thank you! Happy New Years. Hope it's great. 
---
Then tonight was a good night to meet some new single friends ;)
---
No, it’s October 23rd or 24th. 
---
You too!

There's a great source of copper straight east of The Whitespring Service Entrance on the map, slightly northeast of Solomon's Pond. There's a copper deposit there (refer to [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i\_made\_a\_map\_of\_resource\_deposits/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i_made_a_map_of_resource_deposits/)), as well as around 6 copper veins embedded in the surrounding rocks. Each vein can be harvested 2–3 times, and each harvest provides 4 copper ore when using Excavator power armor. You'll just need sufficient acid to process the ore into scrap (1 ore translates to 1 scrap).
---
That's the one I currently camp at, but due to a bug if I place artillery the game doesn't spawn my camp at all. And the more important reason, I want to be away from spawn more so my Tamed deathclaw is safer.
---
I dont think he will be notified of your comments unless you reply to his comment in his comment thread.
---
then why are people coming to the reddits and asking if the game is worth it if there is clearly enough information on a google search, figured it would cut down on the "is this game worth it now" replies on the reddit
---
I've been running the cowboy hat, patrolman sunglasses, and Starsnstripes bandana since about 10 minutes into the game.
---
That explains why I saw a guy had put cement barriers around the box on that conveyor once.
---
The spot I have is really convenient because it's near the center of the map so pretty much never anywhere near nukes or high-level enemies but also I've only ever once logged on to see it occupied by another camp. 
---
No, I'm not telling where.
---
Yeah, I do it all the time. Also leave the factory itself unlocked so people can pick it up if they want. 
---
I cant really argue with your opinion since you said graphics don't mean much to you personally. I can however attack the fact the game is very unoptimized and mechanically feels unfinished like spawns also just "popping" in on you from no where.
---
It should, but there is also the chance someone else picked up the plan on another server. I had to server hop a few times to get the Nuka Cola power armor plan for example because people had already collected them on the servers I initially opened the mound on.
---
You’re unusually passionate about this
---
you need some mentats my guy
---
did you get any good drops?  Nocturnal Wood Legs all around I'm guessing?
---
I have mine I’m selling for like 50caps, I also have a Tesla arc trap I believe 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
He didn't walk up to an open safe and loot it. He picked the lock in an area claimed by another player.  The lock picking is what got him wanted. Just like if he was picking the lock on a resource extractor. 
---
If it's locked expect to become wanted. 
---
Go in the silo by atleast 12:15-12:30 if it’s your first time.
---
Once you get to the launch room it’s 7 minutes until prep is done, 3 for the nuke to fall. Everything up to that point is about how fast you can kill things and repair stuff
---
There shouldn't be micro transactions in a full priced game to begin with. So no this is not a step in the right direction. It's completely unreasonable.
---
I am utterly disgusted by people who buy this stuff and or defend the practice. 
---
I’m testing it now and will report back 
---
Just put them in the stash. They have no weight and if they are important the game wont allow you to drop it in there anyways.
---
There’s a place east of harpers ferry you might be able to reach water and pile at the same time
---
Thanks for trying!
---
Naw, the ticks and blood bugs are tied for creepiest of crawlies 
---
I never said you were wrong, I'm literally telling you just need assassins and call it a day for the limbs.
---
Thanks stranger, think you meant 11:15 - 11:30 but its good!
---
what the hell is a wall pass through conduit ahahah
---
Did you mean to post this on r/Fallout instead? 
---
Didnt even notice that. Absolutely! If I notice I don't build things like that. Like to keep it classy!
---
There's multiple quest starting spawn points.  I stumbled into a young woman's body near Somerville I think.  I've seen it spawn at the radio array, a water processing plant, and I think Lewisburg.  On her body is a green and black tattered dress, a worn veil, and a damaged holotape. Listen to the tape to get the quest going... 
---
I’m dying😂😂😂 my hat of to you good sir. Never let someone keep you down!  
---
Since this is specifically about fallout 76. No. This is the appropriate place to post this. since this reddit is specifically about THIS game. Did I  post in the wrong place if fallout 76 only allows positive rose tinted glasses feedback? Probably then.
---
I say this time and time again. Cosmetic micro transactions are fine. When they add items that actually do something, then we'll have a problem. Until then, I really wish people would stop bitching about cosmetic micro transactions. 
---
Happy new year all!
---
Um they have a 3 suit bundle for 800, and 1 dress for 500, it’s still a little fucked.
---
How close to other locations and Harper's ferry? It's general location? 
---
I lock the front door to my house to see how many people waste lock picks trying to break in.... Take that you PvP hassling jerks!!
---
That place keeps blinding me specially on a nuked zone.  Ran onto a tree while a Yao Guai was chasing my ass, tried to kill it but was also killed in the process. TY TSE Shotgun!
---
They'll nerf it like they nerfed the M79 when they do, don't worry
---
Thank you for this! Never bothered putting on robot armor really since it’s DR was always lower then what I could craft. 
---
pistols have movespeed
---
Also depends on wether you bypass certain things in the silo, me and my buddy repair the mainframe cores at our camp and lockpick our way through the silo and sneak around only takes us 10 min 
---
I think there might be a bug involving how often recurring/respawning characters reappear and their bodies staying there. I mean, you would claim that it's scene-breaking if a boss's corpse is there from the last guy who fought the boss, and you're currently fighting the same boss who is very much alive (and knowing Bethesda, recovering HP).
---
The only time I've seen this happen is the Grafton Monster that roams the riverway outside Poseidon Power in Charleston. I went over to drop the monster, and shot him from the top of the cement wall. As I jumped down off the wall after killing him, his body disappeared. The XP notification from killing him was still on the screen. I haven't seen it with other, lower enemies - go into the Whitespring clubhouse some time after somebody else and count the 37,000 meat piles from scorched/ghouls - but I have seen posts in here complaining about SBs and the SBQ vanishing before they could be looted.
---
I don't think that's how it works? When you relog it uses the highest charged core you have in your inventory, from what I've experienced.
---
Been like this for a while now, it'll get fixed when it gets fixed. Adjust your play accordingly is usually a better tactic than letting a bug ruin your game because you can't figure out alternatives.
---
I don't even....
---
... so many kills, garbage... and you get this...
---
/BANGSHEADONDESK
---
But I'm genuinely happy for you mate, well done!!  Grats.
---
If I could hope on I would defend our house with my explosive 50 cal... 
---
Ne of harpers next to highway 
---
Are you sneaking at the time? I’ve had it happen a bunch when sneaking... even the server thinks I’m gone I guess.
---
Sweet, thanks  
---
Yeah, I tried out one of those orbital grenades just to see what it would do, and apparently there was a molerat somewhere in the boom zone. I was checking out the area at the bottom of the cliff nearby almost 5 minutes later and saw a bleached out molerat corpse go slowly rolling by... presumably endlessly until it ran out of map or hit a wall.
---
Oh and my post was
---
“Griefing is getting much worse”
---
Not the game is getting worse because of griefers, the game is still fun as shit 
---
I do hope so. With all the dupers in the game, this is very game breaking.
---
These are not server based thus they don't have the same continued cost of opperations. 
---
&gt;pals
---
Bold of you to assume I have friends 
---
No need to be aggressive geez. Yeah I have like 6 other guns...
---
This game kept me sane during my sick leave from work for your same issue. Honestly, take it day by day and try and relax through exercise, meditation, and some self reflection. 
---
are you on PC?

I didn't call myself a gamer. I called YOU a gamer. You're also a little bitch. 
---
Ah nope, Xbox sorry. I can’t really remember where I got it from, maybe during the free states questline?
---
lol no
---
the plan is in the world, when you go to a new world it's a new world
---
Geez, it's almost like we can make a statement with just our wallets!
---
Just...no
---
Personally, what I would do, is  enter the silo around 11:20 ish, then when you get to the part were u actually launch the nuke, launch at 11:57. The timer goes for 3 minutes. So if done correctly, it should hit at  Precisely midnight
---
Honestly half of self posts on Reddit could be answered via Google. People just like having a voice or just want to start a conversation.
---
Spawns popping in are usually caused by players entering the same area as you; seen int alot and yes it is annoying at times but there isn't a better system that I know of which would replace it. I would rather everyone be able to fight and kill enemies than someone coming in late and their experience being ruined due to everything being cleared.
---
Why does fallout 76 NEED to be server based? What does a centralized sever system bring to the table besides artificially justifying a cash store?
---
People expect alot from Bethesda. They released a game that is half a year from being finished, 
---
You should be able to open any trailer but its limited to only a few because reasons
---
Thanks, I'll look into it!
---
Was this on PC by chance? The senario sounds pretty familiar to something I did yesterday 
---
Whoa that's possible. He's the only guy in the game that could bridge the gap. I respect Graham more every day
---
Good luck 
---
Your logic is sound, but even after tweaking and tweaking my character’s face they still look gormless; so, it’s helmets all the way, I’m afraid. 
---
Just contradicted yourself. What’s your Facebook? 
---
It charges like a laser musket if you don’t reload more than once each time it will waste your ammo. 
---
Lol ironic you'd say I don't know anybody given that you're the one crying about a game because nobody wants to play it with you. Takes a special kind of idiot to keep moaning about how much they hate on it's subreddit weeks after it's come out. You have way too much free time if you are taking time specifically to bitch on the internet about a game you don't play
---
My last base was on an acid extractor. Good for awhile! Haven't seen too much activity outside of ghouls but I'm gonna hunt down that deathclaw . The mansion above me is always good for some co as well
---
Why wouldn't they have just duped the chems?
---
I'm gonna use an online clock instead my own for that reason because milliseconds and such 
---
Two questions for people here, one is a hypothetical about "duping" and the other is about a situation I experienced which I am asking you guys if it was duping or not.
---
First: **Do you consider the bulk acid exploit (bulk 10, scrap for 15) to be cheating like the duping is?** Why or why not?
---
Second: Situation described below is a spoiler for a Cranberry Bog area quest. [When searching for the saboteur for the Watoga mayor quest, when I found him, several of the containers in his trailer had many, *many* multiples of both his password file and the "Free Watoga!" flyers. Glitch, intended, or attempted dupe cheat?](/spoiler)
---
The wanted mechanic is incredibly poorly implemented with little sense to it. I can steal water from unlocked purifiers just fine but at the very same CAMP I can't unlock their doors that they stupidly locked just so I can't harmlessly use their workbenches (which then means I steal the idiots water that is somehow the one thing they thought didn't need to be locked up lmao).
---
Still have mine, working fine
---
What do you get?
---
I got a Medic's smg and a Troubleshooter's plasma rifle, so not bad. Hubs got a Nocturnal Shishkebab and a Vampire's 50 cal machine gun. 
---
I jumped around a supermutant who was stuck in a shopping trolley each time he missed me he made agitated noises which added to the moment 
---
Oh, and a Grognak axe, which he was super stoked about, haha.
---
I'm a vet. Of many a fallout. Only had a generaror go down one time. My one turret takes care of it lol
---
Honestly i wish that if an aggressor killed you while taking over a workshop the defender didn't loose any caps. The advantage is always on the attackers side since they can either initiate with no response time on your end. Sure they have to be in a little box, but half the time ppl just take it over to kill the person there not to actually capture a workshop.
---
Yea no idea I’ve never looked it up so I’m not sure how their process goes maybe they want exp for making the chems all I know is fuck dupers 
---
Have to tame it near ur camp??? Or everywhere??
---
But like inrepkied above I'll put it on a foundation.
---
Small room with PA inside
---
This story was awesome. 
---
I've got 24 perks I haven't used yet. I'm level 49. 
---
Thumbs up for all the effort you went through to teach him a lesson. The munitions factory is really the only workshop worth taking over unless you love building. With the nerfed extractor output, it’s faster to just scavenge and kill stuff for resources.
---
Lol. Isn't it like 7 xp per chem so it wouldn't be worth it. Not a very smart duper.
---
Grenadier only increases area of effect. Demolition Expert is the one that increases damage.
---
I keep looking at the laminates and stuff and realize I'm not gonna use anything else. The astroturf would be cool on my deck though.
---
I have healing factor and absolutely love it! It’s extremely rare to ever use a stimpak any more. The thing that throws you at first is that it doesn’t kick in until you go from “caution” to “hidden”. But then you get full heal except rads almost immediately:-)
---
Thanks!! Iove building.
---
Oh man what if they change new player spawning points over the course of the game like ESO did? Would be cool. Dunno what other kind of beginnings there could be though
---
Maybe **SKREEE SKREE SKREE** is Scorchbeast for "Hey man I wanna borrow your tinker bench for a minute to make some ammo ok? I'll leave you a barbed walking cane mod for your troubles."
---
&gt;  I'm tired of people making articles and videos for views when they have already made an opinion.
---
Except the articles address different points each time.
---
&gt;If you are a critic you dont review a restraint you already reviewed before.
---
According to...who?
---
&gt; It annoys me that there is media still bashing it when they have made their opinion on the game already and keep making them for content.
---
Perhaps if the game had less content to critique there would be less critical content.
---
I agree. The spamming of its screech is what annoys me the most. 
---
Petty much. I play Destiny or Division while HE plays his mobile games. The gendered stereotype is getting really old.
---
Not sure why this isn't getting up voted more.
---
I voted for 76 because I tend to pick up games and drop them quickly. But if I have friends that I can play with I tend to play it a lot longer.
---
Still wont buy it tho.
---
Name of tape?
---
Disconnect from the internet and play single  player, should stop people from attacking you. That or have you tried the non multiplayer fallout games? 
---
Currently rocking the straight jacket, prison collar and tin foil hat, bottle cap glasses and nuke green hair.  
---
Does it?
---
I was killing ghouls near Charlie I think and one exploded and I swear there was like confetti or something that came out of it as soon as I killed it. IDK if it was cause I looked quickly or what but I swear it exploded.
---
&gt; Your GPU isn't **creating** the meat piles, the game is.
---
A graphics driver is the software that allow your operating system and programs to use your computer’s graphics hardware. If you play PC games, you should keep your computer’s graphics drivers updated to get the best performance out of your hardware.
---
Blocked.  
---
You need the advanced power connectors from Harpers ferry or use a window/door to run a wire directly to the rad shower
---
Why don't you? It's not hard at all to buy the good prefix gear for 1-1.5k a piece tops. Pay more and get it faster but good armor is duped too it's not rare.
---
What I do is go out hunting legendaries for shitty drops.  Like Nocturnal Rolling Pins and Exterminator's Wood legs.  Then, the only time I am ever disappointed is when something good drops, which is rare af.  
---
Nocturnal forever baby
---
What console you on

Get some friends help you get you back on your feet. Your in a waste land bad things can happen and will and that’s okay those things you learn from or can’t even control but get back on your feet. If something like that happens in life you won’t quit that easy same thing here don’t quit get back on your feet maybe even start a new play through just try 
---
Play a shitty, broken game - get burned 
---
All games make you grind to some extent.  I am not happy about the price of the Tricentenial and massive price drop post launch .  But I am having no problems getting in game Atoms, my CAMP has benefited from nice floors and the sweet fish lamp.  So what my friends aren't into building  I am and so are many others.  But I'd never give Bethesda another £, $, €, ¥ for stuff that should be in game plans.  On a separate point, my Xbox friends have now moved off 76 completely.  Truly I am exploring the wasteland as the now lone wanderer.
---
Did people bitch for what  20 years prior of dlc being a thing people looked forward too? People still do with eso and never complain because the content is amazing.
---
The same silos we launch every night pinky
---
I know it's buggy on PS4. Sometimes nothing will be under "team", but if you look under the "recent" tab and see the player that sent you the invite you should be able to click on their name and accept from their. Again it's still buggy though... I can only accept about half the time, and if there's multiple people on the team it seems to make it worse. One on one invites seem to work most of the time though.
---
Fair enough, are you on ps4? I would love to join you.
---
yeah for 6 fusion cells... they're worth like 1cap each? if that?
---
Re equip the pieces, then jump out of your armor and wait 5 secs then jump back in. Should fix it.
---
I'm pretty sure the saboteur thing is a glitch. It's been like that the two or three times I've been in there with team mates. 
---
Same here don’t know why
---
A good practice.
---
https://ibb.co/PZvWdjQ
---
This was one of the most amazing nights I had in the last couple of years! I‘ll definitely be back!
---
Is it locking you out and saying access denied or is it just not working? 
---
Does armor &amp; etc normally take damage after you're already dead? Not in my experience so far. Youtube finally uploaded my video. See for yourself... He's got like a missile launcher or grenade launcher. I can practically tank the scorchbeast queen... Does this mean that missile launchers are a PVP weapon in this game? Cuz they effin suck otherwise...
---
Play another game a little, I do that when I get tired of war thunder. The new Hitman game is pretty good for instance
---
?
---
I had a level 110 person set up camp right by the overseer's camp and attack me (randomly) a couple of weeks ago, and some level 72 kook attack me at the whitesprings train station. I think I was about level 66 then. 
---
No idea what their motivation might be, or age, but it's definitely irritating if you are't into PvP. 
---
Thankfully, they were probably equally irked when I logged off. 
---
I was going to offer you my 3 star plasma gatling on Xbox 1 but nevermind
---
I hope they just remove the effect entirely.
---
Rip. What’s on it
---
Flashes red on the hand scanner
---
Don't use stagger on the queen , she never lands and gets stuck in an animation
---
A hardkore challenge would be to play the game with one character and see how far you get before a server drops or you d/c, if this happens consider the character dead forever. Doubt you'll get far.
---
It doesn't say anything, hand scanner flashes red instead of green and we aren't taken inside.
---
I’ve had no problem with this. Haven’t experienced it yet
---
same issue on pc
---
way way better!
---
I'd like a wall clock to wear like Flavor Fav, some colored legs to look like MC Hammer parachute pants and a big old flat top wig. On my power armor.
---
K.
---
Don't know why you got downvoted, it's actually a really good work around until Beth can directly address it.
---
honestly the nukes have been a bit messed up the whole day, people were saying they had a cooldown so you cant nuke from all the silos within some time on the same server but there was a group of 10-15 players who nuked the prime site at least 4 times while i was on the server with a friend. had 3 blast zones on top of each other at once, got the queen event at least twice
---
So you're suggesting when population hits peak times there's a guy there "manually spinning up servers?"  Or that they couldn't do that because it'd need to be manually done??
---
Maybe theyre trying to prevent everyone from launching at the same time and crashing the servers.
---
anyone?
---
Craft yourselves a Pipe Revolver Rifle that takes advantage of Both Rifle And Pistol Perks.
---
My Lvl 50 is doing 121 Damage base per shot. For Snipers? Craft the .308 Pipe Rifle with the same benefits. My Crafted does 144 Base Damage.
---
I used a cryolator on him and dressed him up, then killed him.  Hat too. 
---
He.  Did.  Not.  Like.
---
No you have to wear the wendigo outfit and kill the wendigo
---
Trust me, I know. But seriously, I spend them so fast before I can even stock pile them
---
Lock away the stash, no need to give someone a drop off for there junk before attacking my base.
---
A single missile turret can do the work of multiple low level machine guns. There still budget heavy. You just need less. 
---
Thanks. Guess it's time to play with radiation until I get it again...
---
When things like that happen I’m just left wondering if it’s some obscure little thing that Bethesda is doing, or if Fallout 76 is legitimately so out of hand that there are enemies unintentionally exploding when they die.
---
That’s part of the complaint most people have.  You’re flooded with Atoms early on and then it slows down a bunch.  For example, I’ve put over 100 hours in and I’m around level 90 and I have 3,100 atoms and I’ve only spent a couple hundred.  I bought a pose and a photo frame.  So the problem is you have my 100 hours of gameplay represented by roughly 3,500 atoms and Bethesda is asking for nearly 2/3 of that for one set of Christmas cosmetics.  It’s overpriced.
---
The idea is to hook you early with a flood of atoms so you can buy stuff off the shop and then slow the earning of atoms to a trickle and feed you stuff like overpriced holiday cosmetics so you break out the wallet because your atom earning has been drastically slowed and you’ve already spent what you’ve earned in game.  I love 76 and have defended it a lot but the atom store is a bit shady with the prices and practices imo.
---
Don't worry, he probably had a straight jacket and witch hat anyway
---
Thanks definitely going to do this!
---
Uhhh. It won’t run?
---
For solo'ing regular scorch beasts, i can still use enforcer right?
---
2 shot 1 agility and something else
---
Im lvl 243 all i get are team invites. If you wanna do some events or fight queen add Vextroa and ill join you on pc
---
Yes mine has been doing it for a few days now torso and arm first now gone to torso and leg. 
---
   Screws up my carry weight as well all the time if I fast travel it happens ,change servers same crap. 
---
You have to kill wendingos until you find the wendingo clown costume plan. Then, you have to tame one and make it equip the wendingo clown costume that you made (it takes about 30 wendingo teeth to make).
---
What a dick. I always love helping people. I never scum over someone like that. 
---
exept almost no one accepts the friend requests from a random player.
---
That might need to be the attitude I take!
---
Very nice ! I was also [pretty close ](https://imgur.com/gallery/9cFuLwh) as you can see
---
Late to the party, but this just happened to me. I had TWO of the +50 weight mods and finally have enough Violet Flux and both of my mods are gone. They were here this morning, but I decided to upgrade the chest piece of my Excavator suit. I'm beyond livid... 
---
Just to save you the disappointment later, I'm pretty sure there is no power armor you can use at level 10. If I remember correctly, the lowest level for raider is 15 and 20 or 25 for t-45
---
Not sure if it’s the New Years vodka or not, but this has me cracking up.
---
I follow the ICW - doing the Great Loop, so we’re rarely more than a few miles from shore. 90+% of the time I have access to data from my AT&amp;T cell phone so I don’t need the internet out to sea plan.. You’re right, the sea plans are insanely expensive. I would only use those for short messages - never streaming.
---
Or they're (Bethesda) just gonna launch nukes at 12 and they don't want ppl controlling them?
---
The last time i killed the Queen (At least a dozen times by now) I got a scorch beast meat as the only dropped then it disappeared on screen, that's when i stopped caring about farming fissure prime
---
Hmm that's a good point.
---
"Damaged Holotape" I believe.
---
No New Year's Eve nuke party at midnight I guess. Bethesda Tweeted for everyone to gather at the Whitesprings bar at 11:45pm EST to take some New Year's Eve pictures. Guess they want to make sure nobody nukes it 
---
I havent found it yet, left or right side of the river? And closer to Harper's or Dyer?
---
It really starts shining with Gun-fu, Adrenaline, Tenderizer, Bloody Mess etc. Have Fun!
---
You on Xbox?
---
Good idea.
---
Exactly! I'm like, weird stuff constantly happens in Bethesda games so I usually pawn it off as "wow that's pretty clever/wild" instead of "I think the servers are commiting seppuku"
---
Idk ingame stuff saya otherwise. We got radiocative craters and terminals talking like the bombs feel nearby and the radiation sweeping in. Read this at the middle mountain cabin thing. 
---
The wanted system definitely needs adjustment. But the lock picking issue is a lack of game knowledge on your part. If you break into my locked resources or my base I absolutely should be able to retaliate. That being said I enjoy PVP with players who want to fight back. Fighting over workshops or just plain revenge is a blast but I'm not going to harass someone who clearly isn't interested. Usually if I see a bounty no matter how small I'll travel to come clear it for you and leave your junk. I think there is a way to engage against other players without griefing. Not all of us are dicks
---
Tbh why have a electric chair if you can't use it? That's like buying a car but I can't use it it's only a prop. They should at least add realism to where you can place a generator to it and fry you, your friend, a piece of junk, Or at least make it a trap. To where when someone sits in it you can quickly attach a wire to it and fry their brain.
---
12 remaining
---
Without video, but Going with your math your gear could have moving target perk while moving. Or sentinel from gear and suppresor legendary weapon for even more negative damage. Until bethesda confirms your math i wouldn't count on this build.
---
Each one also drops ionized meat(never spoiled) and Glowing blood sells for 6 caps each at vendors 
---
It’s literally a circle jerk for views they know there’s a hate train for the game so they use it to their advantage and of course people with hive mind mentality eat it up cause they feel special that there’s a YouTuber/reviewer talking shit about a game they’re salty about not coming out the the exact way they wanted it to come out. People need to learn how to make their own opinions and actually play the game and not eat up everything a nobody is saying for views. Sure the game has problems but Bethesda is working to fix it and there’s no implication of this on these salty ass videos.
---
Special event going on tonight. No nukes tonight !
---
Right side of road by abandon waste dump location
---
I haven't been forced into pvp a lot either, only twice that I remember. I'm not complaining that pvp exists, I am merely requesting that I be warned that an action will flag me for pvp when I've opted out of it by being a pacifist, that's all.
---
And I'm not sure how you managed to clear it by server hopping. I got my eanted status late last night, and couldn't find anyone to kill me until today, after I had logged off and gone to bed. My wanted status definitely did not go away from changing servers.
---
What do I do with all these dead clowns then?
---
I put it back in my inventory today so I'm ready. Fireworks a la nukes!
---
"Professional" reviewers (and I have a hard time talking about Youtubers as being professional reviewers) don't have any credibility in my mind as they're so far out of touch with what fans of a series/show/movie/game are interested in. In extreme cases they are paid to deliver a specific angle in their reviews.
---
One movie for a fandom that I am a part of got single-digit percentage by "professional" reviewers on Rotten Tomatoes when actual fans of the fandom were giving consistent 85% and up. It wasn't a *perfect* movie, but the people it was aimed at certainly enjoyed it, and it was clear that the reviewers who *did* watch it (it was obvious that some didn't) missed significant parts of the story and subtext.
---
I wanna see what becomes of it O\_O :D
---
Sorry, but I'm not the one who put immediately in caps... Which is agressive...
---
Cba to pm
---
There is a special event tonight, no nukes are allowed to be launched this evening.
---
I’m not a West Virginian but I wholeheartedly agree with this.
---
A good basic rule to follow is to keep no more than 100 of any crafting material. Anything over that, bulk and sell immediately. As you play you’ll find that some materials can be as low as 50 or even 0, while others you might want as high as 150, depending on what you burn through. 
---
Some scrap items can’t be bulked but can be sold directly. The same rule applies, just keep an eye on them. 
---
Will you occasionally need to load up on some extra materials? Absolutely, but this will keep you well stocked 99% of the time and make management quick and easy. 
---
The same principle can be applied to any other items in your stash. Just think through what you actually need vs what you think you need for convenience. You’re always going to get more stuff. 
---
The big weight sinks beyond that are mini nukes, missiles, grenades/mines and plasma cores. At one point I had 75lbs of plasma cores in my stash. I don’t use energy weapons at all, so they got dropped. 
---
:)
---
You need the circus training station. Check Wendigo wandering vendor, he has the plans from time to time.
---
Try to snag a couple of his teeth everytime too, it will speed up the process.
---
I mean, I can’t speak to late game atom earning, obviously. Maybe it changes then - I’ll find out in like 5 months when I finally get to lvl 90, I guess.
---
In borderlands there are only 4 players. Once you start adding more(like the 24 in 76) you get much longer load times and unstablity across the board. As well as connection lag and snapping, which I have found 76 to actually be very good about. 
---
Never mind I've never some the quest before
---
Can only hope they do something very significant to improve this game, or it's going to have a short life :(  Doesn't look very encouraging at the moment :(
---
You to fellow vault dweller. And Happy New Year to you to from Boone, WV.
---
Does plans for the helmet spawn in the same places as the other pieces?
---
&gt; Duurrrr, cause it has to?
---
Clearly you are missing the point. Why did bethesda face to design 76 as a server based game? What aside feature of 76 necessitated this decision? So far all I've got is "the fanboys will defend the existence of our cash shop if they think the game costs us money to run."
---
WHAY!!!!
---
Sim City insisted it would be online only, but relented and created a single player offline version. Star Trek Bridge Command insisted it would be VR only, but relented. You underestimate the value of a complaint. But what right do I have to gripe? Nobody on Reddit does that...
---
It just works
---
Pretty sure the chemistry station has all you would need to do it. 
---
Thanks, I think I have seen that before. I think I was thinking of Brahmin Pen.. any idea what that does or where its located by chance?
---
Innovative
---
No nukes tonight boys.
---
Thanks, I found it but my purifiers can't reach water for sure. I might take it anyways though. I need to think about it. Thank you!
---
Yes 
---
Have a good night of gaming 
---
Okay..? You don't need to friend them to join the server. So long as it's just a disconnect (not a full crash) they'll appear in the "recent" tab under social. You have the option to join the server they're playing on from that menu. 
---
the point is not how luck effects the condition, it's how I have some examples of Poor RNG Seed and Exceptional RNG Seed, the holds through multiple tests.
---
That is the Brahmin pen it gives you fertilizer and a brahmin that gives you fertilizer
---
Why do I feel like Bethesda is going to spawn nuke zones for free when the bomb drops
---
I posted on how toxic they were and they did exactly what I said they where going to do
---
Hopped servers until it worked... Definitely haven’t experienced that before 
---
You can use a bare chassis, for considerable benefit, at any level.
---
1. For the most part all the articles and videos circle jerk how the game is buggy. I don't see them making different points i see them calling the game empty and the many bugs. There isn't much else they cover.
---
2. If you are a critic you don't constantly review the same restraunt you go to other ones and critique them. I wasn't clear before but ass long as their is plenty of time in between each review its fine but a game like fallout 76 obviously isn't going to be fixed two months except for the most urgent bugs. So there is no need to critique the game this soon from release as it will be mostly the same.
---
3. That's not the point I didn't say it shouldn't be critiqued. However all these people have already critiqued it and are just doing to get cheap views and clicks and have nothing new to add.
---
“Set the fast travel to be inside.....”
---
What?!?! Tell me more please 
---
You too
---
It’s just bugs though. It’s just not the way the game is supposed to be. &amp; I haven’t finished my current play through! I want to launch a nuke before restarting at least. 
---
I'll take one
---
is that a bug? thought additional damage would kill you (unless I read that wrong)
---
I’m playing overwatch. I reckon the toxicity level of that will push me back into fo76 quickly. ;) 
---
Or by either holstering or un-holstering your weapon.
---
\- rep
---
If it's any consolation you can't use PA your level. You can wear just the chassis, and those are very easy to find in this game.
---
I'm online now. Been server hopping trying to find lever plans so just let me know when you're ready and I'll go to my camp and stick around on a server. 
---
I enjoy them and I hope they don't get changed.
---
I honestly wish this sub could go one day without that kind of suggestion. If you want to watch the noclip documentary about the development of 76 you'd see how the idea behind not doing that is so everyone is different and it encourages people with different setups to work together. 
---
Don't drink and post, knucklehead.
---
If i wasn't out with friends tonight id gladly launch a nuke with you 
---
So it's not better? Damn that's a shame.
---
it shouldn't kill you directly after you die because if something fires constantly at you you will just die strait away which removes the purpose of the reviving thing in the first place
---
&gt; If you are a critic you don't constantly review the same restraunt you go to other ones and critique them.
---
You do if the restaurant keeps 'improving'.
---
&gt;a game like fallout 76 obviously isn't going to be fixed two months except for the most urgent bugs
---
So reviews on urgent bugs after two months are ok then. But wait...
---
&gt;all the articles and videos circle jerk how the game is buggy
---
Wow! Pretty much the perfect moment caught on video!

it's funny because you wouldn't be complaining if you were on the giving side. "nerf explosives!" boils down to salt most of the time, really.

they're not even that op unless you spec properly. an auto explosive laser rifle will shave less than 1% off a high level scorched, how is that op?

Black powder two shot The Dragon is pretty epic. Over 1000 damage.

Yesterday I was playing alone and died in a nuke zone. I tried to respawn but it kept saying I couldn't fast travel into a nuke zone and gave me no other spawn options. I only had one option which was quit to menu and rejoin. Only, none of the players on my recent tab gave me the option to join...
---
I did not think of this.    
---
For my Pistol char I could make that first weapon and take both weapon type perks?
---
SO free since 2005... then WoW happened and now i'm here.
---
I’m aware. Just wanted to at least gather it. It was the first power armor I seen in my play through and my buzz at getting it was broken by the server issues.
---
Some wendigos are friendly. Power armor scares them away. So you have to walk up to one unarmed, and initiate conversation. Then you can ask nicely to equip clown costume.
---
Well as long as you stay in lower leveled regions you should be fine; but leave the forest area and go anywhere to the east and you will have issues with outdoor generators. Great looking house though!
---
Yeah I tried to and did that repeatedly and it still didn't accept that stage as finished. I just gave up and left. It's ridiculous that you need 2 people to easily complete it.
---
Well, if they’re going for a shared world they’re either looking at some sort of server/client architecture or some kind of peer-to-peer setup. Are you saying they should have chosen a p2p architecture?
---
I usually don’t lock up water to leaves it free for players walking by. If they added a wanted level for just taking the water, that’d suck for people that want things open to the public.
---
I heard You cant launch nukes tonight.
---
What platform?
---
I’ve been doing this too! Unfortunately most of the time people decline it. :( Every now and then I get someone who accepts so hopefully more people will if they know about it. Thanks for being awesome!
---
It is a mystery
---
I have three floors and the foundation of my house is high above a lake where my purifiers and resource collectors are. 
---
My 2nd floor is a large loft over first floor and my stairs to three go up over the empty space above floor one. 
---
Borderlands only has 4 players due to the limits of splitscreen couch co-op (and possibly coming up with and balancing more than 6 vault hunter classes per title) not because of networking plenty of peer to peer and local host games have had more than 4 players. Also why does 76 need 24 players? What part of its design necessitates this many people at once served by a centralized sever? Aside from "that passing rando has a t51 PA with christmas lights! I want that! But Why do I have to pay extra money for it? Oh right centralized servers cost money to run, and we totally need those for some reason"
---
Possibly related but Scorched Officers haven't had codes all day. And come to think of it my nuke codes didn't delete either, normally they'd be toast by now on a Monday night.
---
Hmm something's fucky...

You have more chance of just having nothing spawn there instead though xD

If you pick one up, it'll start a cooldown and you can't get anything until that expires. Server hops will not help you
---
No nukes can be launched till the New Year!   Make sure to be at the bar in white springs at 11:45pm est
---
Ya you don't need any invite.  They can be oblivious.   Just look up their name, choose More-&gt;Profile, join game.  You're in their world, they have no idea.
---
Well that's pretty sad, I saw people there complain about Bethesda got diss, people who defend Bethesda got diss, it almost feel like they don't actually care about Fallout, and just want to be edgy and cynical, I was like that once, and I'm not pround about it.
---
Not at all. But I got the gist, too late to join in though. 
---
Instructions unclear...
---
I do have my own TSE rifle, even without the demo expert perk, it still hurts a lot. That is why I am not using it.
---
At least kite it or something. Anyone can kite.
---
easy just put it on him

Seriously? Huh. Thanks for letting me know.
---
Well supermutans have 10 agility check to stealth effectly.

And You always Need furtive perks maxed.

Encouragement to play together maybe? Lol

They have plans to release new servers for a dedicated PVP [mode](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/6Gmr5HkkEgOY2k8qyey4M8/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-december-19-2018).   
---
You won't even have the option to do the handshake first before you get obliterated. I haven't seen a single post on either sub about this massive issue. Lengendarys break any hope for balancing PVP. TSE guns are going to be the meta for PVP. Anything else will be a player chosen handicap.    
---
76 for me is the bleakest of the Fallout series...  Nobody had a happy ending.  
---
[This is a thread I worked on with another redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a4mhxx/any_investigated_the_west_tek_gps_coords/?utm_source=reddit-android).
---
Tl;dr here's the highlights of the above thread:
---
In short, its a snallygaster. Kind of a bummer.
---
 [Depiction of snallygaster from enclave science wing](https://xboxclips.com/O918/screenshots/e207a310-6e58-4efd-b076-4fe9c83a84dd)
---
[here is a link to an overlay of those coords, outside the real huntersville IRL, and my best guess as to where they would be in fo76](https://www.reddit.com/user/O918/comments/a4w4fu/west_tek_coords_overlay_fo76/?utm_source=reddit-android). Interesting idea: if those coords are a real geocache.
---
For a while I was running on a hunch that am52 was this behemoth near that red circle on the map, until I reread that terminal entry about the appearance (I guess I only read the coords 1st time).
---
I’ll keep this brief and to the point
---
I think there’s an issue with the durability of energy weapons. They don’t seem to last more than one clip- having max rank gunsmith and the “luck of the draw” (or whatever the name is of the perk that has a chance to repair your weapon) seems to have little to no impact as well.
---
I have a quad combat rifle and go through several clips (each one being 80 rounds) and don’t have to worry about it breaking mid-fight, but my double explosive Ultracite laser rifle will break after about 2-3 clips being fired, never mind the fact that the ammo is not exactly common, to boot.
---
This is very frustrating and makes an entire weapon type not viable for use, whereas my all rise will be able to go for days without repairs as long as maxed out makeshift warrior is active. 
---
I’m aware there are more important stability issues that, rightly so, take precedent, but I think small balancing things like this could go a long way towards improving the game and the longevity of the player base as a whole.
---
Thank you to those who took the time to read this, and Happy New Year! 🙂
---
I’m not a little bitch! Nuh uh!
---
76 is clearly not a ranked competitive game so yes I think they should have gone p2p so that we wouldn't "need" a cash shop. And I say need in quotes because if someone doesn't have a good reason why we need server/client then in turn we don't need the cash shop that supports it.
---
Yeah 
---
This Mongrel dog meat is **RAW!**
---
You can't have meaningful PK with no stakes.  When nothing can really be gained or loss, the only people doing PK are the trolls and no game should ever cater to them.  Look at GTA Online, where you can't walk down the street without somebody blowing you up for literally no reason.
---
GTA Online at least has the benefit of selling players new toys to kill people with.  Fallout provides nothing.  There's only so many times somebody can slap somebody to death before they get bored and quit the game.  Good riddance when they do leave.
---
If you disconnected due to a server crash how could you possibly rejoin the same server instance
---
that's nothing, [a mod author uploaded evidence](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/189) that they're even worse (second image, bottom right)
---
10 remain
---
That's what happens when you copypasta a single-player game whose "Very Hard" setting is stupidly easy and got turned into a console shooter to appeal to godmode kiddies.
---
I found two guys that matched the scenario. The server was lagging like crazy and then crashed as soon as I got close. The high level guy was working at a weapon bench and wearing a santa suit. I feel a bit conflicted about Santa now...
---
demo expert is not the only perk they benefit from.
---
and you're not using a strong weapon because... it's too strong? I find that hard to believe.
---
Only things which were protected against an EMP charge should work. In that manner the advanced robotics, most military stuff that was made in anticipation for a nuclear war, etc. I'm guessing the only reason lamps work is for the convenience factor. 
---
Everything else was fried after the bombs fell. That's why you don't see anyone cruising the wasteland in sleek new cars. The NCR had a few half-tracks at their use but they had to completely refurbish the parts themselves. Actually, speaking of electricity in Fallout, it doesn't do too much to think about it. It'll make your head hurt. There are generators around which eat through, presumably, gasoline. And we know gasoline was so crazy expensive and controlled before the war that it makes no sense that you'd still be finding viable reserves of it, let alone enough to power generators. 
---
Sorry for the tangent, the subject has been bugging me for awhile.
---
Why am I up voting this if it makes me sad?
---
Ty I’ll have to look through my stash, holotapes weigh nothing so I stash them 
---
So small group p2p so you and your friends can play together after completing the solo game experience?
---
Not sure why you're said that, I'm being as polite as possible I can, if you're refering to how I describe people who wishing physical harm on others because of video game and you have a better idea of how to address these people, I'm all ears.
---
Is the suppressor worth it not to attract more enemies even with the range hit?
---
If Bethesda was a relationship I would have ended it by now. 
---
He asked you how duping affects the game *technically*, not how you fucking feel about it.
---
I’ve watched enough videos of the main duping method to know that’s not what’s crashing the servers.
---
I also don’t trust other people like yourself blaming other players when the WC glitch was being used ubiquitously and designated as the main cause for server instability. It was fixed and nothing changed.
---
I’m asking this for the 10th time: how does duping affect you when PvPing in this game (don’t care about PvP since it’s a mode that’s barely being utilized)? Still waiting for a good answer beyond the “I don’t like cheaters” like that 5 year olds are so fond of saying.
---
Yikes, you win. Pass the heating pad, ole buddy.
---
Post on bazaar.  I got mine replaced by a higher level one in no time. 
---
1. Yes and you have to give them time to improve and restraunts improve much faster than games.
---
2. Yes the most urgent bugs get fixed first but there is still other urgent bugs that need to be fixed as well. I worded it wrong there because there is still a ways to go and its not like there are no minor bugs after that. Much of the point of giving it time was to give it time. To wait 6 months then come back to it not re-review every Monday and expect much of a difference. If they reviewed it once at the release and once when the stop bug fixing. I would be fine but the sheer amount of just articles and videos on it about it being buggy repeating what they already said kinda annoys me instead of making more new content.
---
So here's what you do. You find a circus station from the wandering wendigo vendor, he has a 5% spawn chance in the scorch beast queen event. He's call Wendingus and looks like a mini megasloth. 
---
Approach him unarmed because if any weapon is drawn by anyone, he aggros into a hermit crab, power armor also scares him off.
---
Ask him nicely for his teeth and then trade 1000 caps for the circus station plans (lots of Wendi teeth needed)
---
From here you can then call upon a tame wendigo at your camp and send him to the circus station. Once he gets on the trapeze, he'll have a dead clown tied to him.
---
After watching his act for 20 minutes, give him a thumbs up, if he thumbs ups back, kill him. If he attacks, you have to start over.
---
Hope this helps, good luck!
---
I don't know.. maybe I'm wrong but I did this last week to get around a disconnect.

Early on, I'd just slotted the second rank of picklock, and then I forgot about it. ...Until I was wandering around and saw a rank 2 lock on a glowy thing! This was before I had a full grasp of what resource extractors are, and how workshops work. So, I got excited, because this was the first rank 2 lock I'd seen, and I proceeded to pick it! Just as I finished, I got that little pop up text that mentions that sort of activity could make me become wanted. I said "oh, woops" and backed off, leaving the stuff in the extractor. No idea if I actually became wanted at that time, I didn't think to check, nor did I know how.  
---
Not five seconds later, the owner of the workshop I had inadvertently vandalized came stomping around the corner in his shiny yellow power armor. He stared at me. I stared at him. And then he bashed my teeth in. I'm not into PvP myself, so I ran crazily in a little circle while he did so, and then I proceeded to die. I think I apologized on mic as my freshly-battered corpse self, but I can't remember. Anyway. I fast traveled back to the Overseer's camp near Flatwoods and was entirely ready to go about the rest of my night, lesson-learned. Only to have Power Armor Guy appear in camp and start talking to me. He noticed I'd not grabbed any of the stuff from the extractor and had followed me to ask if I needed some. Real nice guy. We laughed at my faux pas and ended up hanging out for a bit after that.  
---
Would it have been cool if the game warned me before or during my lockpicking adventure regarding what I was accidentally doing? Sure. But then I might not have met Power Armor Guy and gained a buddy to hang out with that night. That said, might be handy if we could figure out an efficient way to petition for mercy-killings on this Reddit to help clear unintentional bounties.
---
Maybe not alone, but happy new years to you too strangur.

I’ve got a bit more time than you do, and even though Atom income slows down at higher levels, the daily and weekly challenges are still enough to pull in a few hundred Atoms a week. 3,100 Atoms also seems pretty low for someone around level 90, so you probably missed a few easy challenges.

They literally made the scorchbeasts.
---
Honestly dude, that was just way too much text. Your arguments we're lengthy and too abstract to get the general gist of. I did my best to read as much of it as possible but even as a supporter of 76 it just came off as a never ending rant. Keep it short and sweet man. You'll have better luck
---
I don't think it's worth the points, but there is a perk card that drastically reduces hunger &amp; thirst while at camp. 
---
Not just me having this issue then. I also find voice chat just stops working if I get a team invite or invite to a different world sometimes (even if I ignore it). On XB1
---

Alright I’m hopping on as well, ign:AngryCaboose 
---
At any random spawn locations across the map. You can find them everywhere, but mostly outside named locations. On the roads, near points of interest (pylons, abandoned camps), etc. 
---
If you have no idea where you can find some random spawn locations, just explore the roads a few times on different servers. You'll see that different enemies appear at specific locations.
---
As far as I know, it has not been on sale outside of Black Friday and holiday sales. It only seems consistent because we are in a season of sales.
---
This story is great. The only thing is anyone 45+ is using the same weapons tbh. The 2shot explosives cap at 45 I believe so he might be 100 but if you’re over 45 and esp 50+ you have the same special points and same weapons available. Good going man!
---
Cliff camps ftw!
---
Swap in Hacker 3 to shut down the turrets. It made my second silo run waaaasssy easier.
---
I'd be interested in larger groups of the game actually implemented some mechanic that made use of or necessitated them, but the game now as implemented is basically a very unpolished borderlands with some survival elements, and subnatica's style of story telling. The need of a server/client architecture seems excessive, and artificial towards trying to justify having a cash shop.
---
I've read hundreds of FO posts over the last few days, and don't see anyone saying PVP rocks, it might be the one thing everyone agrees on
---
This is awesome! Is it possible to add all locations of water? Many of us want to see if a resource node is close to water.
---
That was my first lakeshore camp spot also until people kept building there.  
---
The free meat was hard to give up but I am not far down the river and surprisingly found an acid resource I can put a collector on that is underwater
---
I added two fertilizer collectors when I was in that spot and it looked like I had 5 Brahmin. 
---
Nice.
---
Gonna travel to my camp
---
Very true! I didn't know that it did, and now I do and won't be making the same mistake again. But, to be fair, it's not like I broke into that person's camp. This was a safe that was part of the munitions factory, and there was nothing to differenciate it from any other safe in any other location. When you claim a workshop, it lends itself to believe that you claim the object you interact with, not the entire location. But as you said, that's on me for now knowing. I certainly wouldn't have done it if I'd known.
---
There's a mod that does this.  Been using it for a few days and I have to say that I agree.
---
I mostly use it to switch between my main build, and one for unlocking, hacking, and crafting.
---
MTXs are not inherently bad, and Fallout 76 is one of the better MTX systems. They fund post-launch support, and I’d much rather get a free content with optional cosmetic purchases than paid DLC packs.
---
Just want to make sure to keep your expectations real. Beth tweeted to ask everyone to meetup at the Whitesprings bar to take some New Year's pictures. Chances of a unique event is unlikely.
---
I think I'm done until this game is patched significantly
---
Under misc there's a fast travel mat. They had it for C.A.M.P.s in beta but removed them in the full release for some reason. They still exist for workshops though. 
---
The only problem with putting it inside sometimes though is that anyone who fast travels there, by fast traveling to a friend or party member, ends up in the fast travel mat too. Munitions is a little broken right now, which makes defending it for PvP a chore at times.
---
Keep it up you generous wastelander! You make it so the high level players aren’t hated completely!
---
That's too bad,  i hoped they stuck around as long as you were on the server. 
---
Alright, meet you there
---
There's no such thing as a full set of dense anything. It's a chest only mod and tbh if there was a way to counter explosive shotguns in pvp it would be common knowledge.
---
I'll be down in about an hour, gotta wait for my girlfriend to get off work otherwise I'd have to leave mid run
---
I just ran past the Scorchbeast to finish the quest.
---
Same, that's why I tried it myself but they were always gone when I went back. 
---
Old news then, but doesn't Subject AM49 sound way more like the Snallygaster 
---
But the description seen in the Enclave Science wing makes Subject AM52 being a Snallygaster make more sense as I based the subject as the in game Snallygaster model. 
---
Thanks telling me this
---
Find a mod for it.... oh wait
---
ran into him again got shit
---
Yeah it’s stupid. People like what they like, gender doesn’t matter. 
---
We would be playing it together too but... well... all the problems with FO76 kinda drove him away. I’m still hooked though. 
---
Lol I feel this 100% recently started going to whitesprings instead of watoga if low levels are there so I can help them level. I'll do 80% of the damage to the charred and then let them get a hit in. Idk how many times I've stood there and let them beat me to near death so they can get the xp. Not to mention crafting hunting rifles or 10mil smgs. I can't help myself if I see them using pipe pistols and dying from it. 
---
Take a break if you aren't enjoying it. Come back when you do.  
---
I like randomly wandering around and doing funny shit with friends so I keep logging on. If you get bored try other games or activities.
---
Will do. I got a butt cushion and reruns of golden girls on. Ensure is in the fridge. Feel free to join. Lol
---
Was the safe a stash box in disguise? Cause that is actually a thing. If not then I didn't even know you couldnt unlock regular safes if its owned. Its possible you might have shot an extractor or something by mistake. Happens to me a fair bit. 
---
Two of the Brahmin keep drowning themselves, they had one bar of health left last time I saw them.
---
The weekly and daily challenges are the aforementioned grinding.  The post I responded to was talking about doing it without grinding at all.  That’s what I was responding to because he said he had spent 1,200 atoms without grinding.  
---
The 3,100 may be low because I played a bunch of the beta and I don’t know if all those challenges came through or not, I never checked.  I’ve also bought a couple things so it’s probably closer to 3,500 total which I said.
---
Either way, pulling in a few hundred atoms a week and then asking for 2,000 for 1 cosmetic pack is still a bit ridiculous.  Even, if you can pull in 500 atoms a week, that’s a month of daily logins and doing challenges for 1 Christmas cosmetic pack.
---
Anyone know  the event 
---
I imagine you’re a squeaker. 
---
Instructions unclear, penis stuck in wendigo.
---
I think he was talking about Fallout 4 and Dogmeat's ability to fetch items for the player and some of the settlement building aspects. In regards to FO76 he literally said "sometimes it doesn't just work". I realize it's just a meme, but a little context goes a long way sometimes.
---
Do you have any idea how long that cooldown is? Hours? Days?
---
Around  camp mcclintock you can find some ammo bags each have 2-3 I think also a quest there. 
---
Thanks. Might start a new char to try this Pipe weapons spec out.
---
This is the biggest reason for the inflated prices. The Atom Shop prices are balanced pretty much exclusively around the in-game Atom income. 100 Atoms can be pretty easily pulled in through a few hours of gameplay, so they have to scale up prices to compensate. However, the Atom-to-dollar exchange rate doesn’t take this inflation into account and makes Atom Shop prices seem really high.
---
I can’t stress this enough, but getting a playgroup does wonders.
---
This is an attempt to pace the game world. If they let the clock run then eventually we would be in the same timeframe as FO 1-4 and NV. Bethesda will likely move the clock forwards when major events take place. Imagine what changes the world will have gone through after one year lore wise. SBQ will lie dead, The figure sites may be sealed up and whitespring might even be a massive hole.
---
I hope it’s nothing too cool, Ingot work tomorrow and will miss it.
---
Still got some? 
---
Where did you find the tile floors?  I don’t recall that in the atom shop.  I have the wood floors. 
---
My point is that I wouldn't have picked a safe like any other in the game if I'd known it would flag me. It's all good and fine if the player has extractors that are locked, they are related to the workshop mechanic and it is intuitive that they would be viewed as a pvp offense. A safe inside the layout not directly linked to the mechanic of claiming a workshop is definitely not intuitive, although you make a fair point about locked doors being the same (another thing I didn't know would flag me).
---
To be fair though, it's not like I stole something the player placed there for safekeeping. It contained randomly generated loot completely separate from any player action, just like any other safe in the world.
---
Either way I feel it's rather poor design, as it creates false flags.
---
White knight rank 3 and you won’t have to worry about ballistic fiber again.
---
Wendigos dislike clothes, as is obvious. However, they like shiny things, such as screws, and collect them obsessively. So. You need a shiny clown suit.
---
Normal clown suits you find are not shiny. You need to go to the costume store in the north area of the Savage Divide, and search it till you find a quest item “box of sequins.” Do NOT collect the box of glitter, it afflicts you with a disease “Fuck This Shit” that causes -4 CHA due to being in a bad mood. It’s also bugged so it doesn’t keep coming back like it’s supposed to. Anyway, craft at a tinker bench the Shiny Clown Suit, which will let you interact with any Wendigo. Poof, Wendigo in a clown suit. Also, this quest will randomly reappear. If you don’t do it, you’ll get randomly afflicted with glitter. Again.
---
I’m a big dummy then :D

&gt;Instigating the dragon sells for 2.5k
---
&gt;Thats 3 hours of grinding caps over 3 days. 
---
&gt;Day one: hit whitesprings loot junk. Sell it to vendors (both vendors) - hit watoga. Same deal. 
---
&gt;Day2 and 3: Repeat. 
---
&gt;2400 caps. Happy new years.
---
You can get 1,400/day (well, 1,350 with travel costs) by hitting all 7 vendors. 
---
I tested this just now on PC.
---
What I did was making 6 light boxes and wire them all up (more than 10 wires)
---
Then I scrapped all the light boxes without scrapping the wires.
---
At the end none of my budget was taken up.
---
Can others on all platform try this out and report here too? 
---
Okay, I will see what I can do.
---
15-19
---
After 20 it never appeared for me.
---
Between those lvls above they were both at BOS and harpers ferry a few times I checked.
---
I have almost every weapon plan because I checked each vendor multiple times every couple levels .
---
This is my #1 complaint at lvl 275.  
---
15 to 20 for vendors. Patrol Duty event is best, but I can never get it to start.
---
&gt; exploit
---
You just answered your own question. The only delusional entitled kiddies who try to whine about how it isn't cheating just want something for nothing. Pro tip: if it is any kind of **exploit**, it is **cheating**, it's what the word refers to. It isn't an opinion, it isn't a legal case, this ain't the People's Court, you can't take it to Jerry Springer.
---
I realize many might not **want** it to be cheating, but what they want means **fuck-all.**
---
Unfortunately not I'm on the box sorry for the late reply was closing up at work and planning for my fun
---
Source? 
---
Also check any of those mini apc style looking things with the open backs, they tend to give fibre. Scrapping any spare power armour chassis's give fibre too.
---
Yeah sometimes they do and sometimes they are up a long time.    Tried to build a camp where they would spawn inside my “pool” on the bottom floor.  They kept blocking my door and I couldn’t get in my own house. 
---
just dont
---
had a level 47 earlier (i’m level 21) fight me and win. i then respawned and killed him, then killed him again when he respawned. he respawned again and shot my house with a fat man. i just turned that shit off. 
---
16x the detail.  
---
I could see them doing that as most people are probably thinking similarly but that would truly suck
---
Maybe it's a Y2K joke. 
---
Please tell me you're on PS4. I feel like Golden Girls RP needs to be a thing and my old ass is up for it. I call dibs on Dorothy.
---
This was duindorp ! 
---
It's true that it allows it, but it doesn't decide a games programming, and it certainly cannot change server side settings. The game itself is what reduces the piles to mush in order to prevent strain on the gpu, and additionally, the servers. 
---
In all honesty, you should have an actual idea of what a computer is doing before you go and make comments like this to other people.
---
Me: certified IT networking and coding whiz 
---
You: some nobody on the net deciding that people are wrong and making assumptions based on the idea of computer parts or device management that isn't true.

Blocked
---
worked before patch doesnt work after patch for me. :( and game almost always crashes more than it dc’s for me.
---
If you want a guaranteed shot at 3 stars, can't you do Uranium Fever?. I also still get new plans from claiming workbenches occasionally. Not that your ideas don't have merit, just saying.
---
Looking good. Really any melee build will be good for running around killing stuff. Will have to use a rad-suit for nuke zones if you go non-PA.  
---
Also, running a bloodied weapon, nerd rage, adrenal reaction, twisted muscles, and talons makes for some really explosive damage when under 20% health. Especially x3 sneak damage.   
---
I play a 2h-bloodied melee build with PA. My hammer usually hits for about 1700 without sneak attacks.
---
Well, the Charleston Landfill has steel and water, but it sure ain't green.
---
The official lore was no direct hits
---
There was definitely no mistaking this as just a plain old safe that is a part of the layout. Since I have pacifist turned on, I can't initiate pvp from shooting at someone or something owned by someone. This safe was in an office on the 2nd floor next to plenty of cabinets that I was able to loot just like normal.
---
Thanks so much :)
---
Yes... this. 
---
Hehe, yeah. I should have specified in the post I'm looking for camp locations.
---
So true, I have over 140 of it lol 
---
No kidding. That's like 200+ lbs of weight. 
---
Ohh, my bad.
---
My personal hunch (with no supporting facts!!) is that the rewrite of the creation engine to support multiplayer and this quasi-seamless server architecture is for something else (Starfield?) or was an excuse to develop technology they didn’t already have.
---
Same, no matter what I do it never triggers
---
10/10 title
---
Would call again 
---
Next time just invite them to the team.  When you leave they will inherit your workshops.
---
Do explosive weapons glitch the queen? Had the queen not take any damage 3 times now and I know several people in the group are running TSE’s one shotting the adds but can’t get her health bar to move 
---
The point is I can't unlock a door that only prevents me from harmlessly using crafting tables but can freely take their water.
---
Look for hank
---
I hope you feel better man! Thank you for your kind words.
---
I have heard of the Patrol Duty but that is completely random drops including duplicates so I think it would take a while.
---
Really just find the steel spot and make the land water purifier if it comes down to it
---
Yeah no problem, I don't have the space for all of them and I hate to just throw them on ground. 
---
The daily and weekly challenges generally aren’t much of a grind. Generally they’re things like “Kill a Robot” for dailies and “Complete 5 quests” for weeklies. They’re almost always things you’re going to be doing anyways, so they are not a grind. Your Atom income will also be supplemented by the occasional non-timed challenge, which can give you up to 80 Atoms at a time.
---
I can also confirm that Atoms/challenges completed in the beta carried over to the full game. I had about 2,400 to spend when the game came out from beta play.
---
Remember that the Christmas pack was, as the name implies, a bundle of items that typically cost 200-500 Atoms on their own. The only thing that I could consider scummy about that is that the included items were not available for individual sale.
---
Oh no!! Unfortunately, I'm on Xbox. I'll make sure to try and slur it up with a Blanche character, when I inevitably make a female character.

Here's a thread on some locations for ballistic fiber.  Also, for non-legendary items it can be cheaper to build rather than repair.  Use the White Knight perk to reduce resources, too.
---
Best place to farm ballistic fiber? https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a8vh5e/best_place_to_farm_ballistic_fiber/
---
Also, McClintok is decent (no enemies) if nobody has visited in a while.  Two bags spawn at the skeleton and car located 10-15 yards before you reach the front gate.  Inside the main building two bags can spawn (one on a locker on the right, one on the desk/shelf on the left), and there can be military grade duct tape upstairs near a Bowie knife.  In the live-fire range two more bags can spawn in the building.
---
I tend to graciously remind lower levels that when taking a workshop to fortify it up so no one can reach claim bench without going wanted.
---
I best show them by claiming the work shop, beating them up couple times, fortifying the shop, giving a brief overview on how /why.
---
Then i supply them with a level appropriate weapon of a type they prefer, 1000 rounds of x ammo and 20 diluted stims and Salisbury steaks.
---
I had a level 21 actually try to fight back several times. It made me so happy i gave him a bonus 2k credits and a set of lvel 15 raider power armor.
---
Tough love is the best kind of love. 
---
::( man im so sorry to hear i hope your body attempts to heal soon and im glad the game is helping someone else as well! ❤️ much love
---
There's no "might be" about this, it IS your character's carry weight. Go look at your stash box, it'll give you the same 180 limit when we KNOW that the stash box has a maximum of 600. If you still don't believe me, ask yourself why the carried weight goes UP when you take something OUT.
---
I have bad news for you: you have no choice. Until Bugthesda overhauls the system, any nimrod of any level can take your head off in one overpowered shot, at any time, whether or not you have Pacifist on (which does not protect YOU, only OTHER people) and right through the "damage reduction" of being attacked without cause.
---
Fair point about pacifist and being wanted being two separate things. While I don't agree with your assessment that I stole something from someone (it was a plain old safe with RNG loot), I agree that maybe my idea of what the pacifist flag is, isn't actually what it does.
---
I'll give this a try next time I'm online. Sounds like it'll work! 
---
I'm not sure if this would help, but:
---
[https://fo76map.com/](https://fo76map.com/)
---
The PvP mechanics in this game are really god awful. They need to fix legendaries (mostly explosive, but i think two shot as well because it has PvE implications in that all the other prefixes are just bad compared to it, rendering them useless), but its already ruined. These super hard to find (Im level 201, never duped or glitched in any way, and after killing probably close to 3 or 5000 legendary creatures, only found 4 explosive weapons and none of them two shot) TSE weapons which should be a rarity to see are commonplace because of the duping problems.
---
Game is a mess tbh, would love a private server to just play solo

Say what you want, it replaced my all rise super sledge

Hey thanks for the offer. I'll add you next time I'm on.

I would rather MTX personally, as someone who does not have a reliable or expansive income, I am able to purchase the game and play for as long as I want, with a monthly fee, there would potentially be months I would have to miss out on when more important things would need to be paid for (such as bills, etc.)
---
Yes I can run the event and legendaries do spawn. But it's always mole miners. That's its. *background heavy breathing is all I hear in my head phones. Scorthbeast constantly screeches, plus the rad needle going apeshit in Whitesprings. The constant burr, burr, burr of the alarm in a silo.* Cant we have a challenge without me walking away feeling like assaulted in my ear? I wear a headset for sound and in a lot of the events I have to take them off my head because it's just too much. Could just be me but a lot of the audio in this game is over the top. Except the atomic shop/whitesprings shopping music, fucking fantastic.
---
It is not currently in the game
---
Only reason I could think is they’re kids. Most adults and seasoned gamers don’t care to babysit anyone. They always wanna party up, then beg for stuff. I’m with you, I don’t mind sharing and being kind but when it’s asked for especially by kids, I’m less likely to be as generous.
---
I made my house look like my real one
---
I've been looking at it, but that map is not showing all the small body water locations. So I thought maybe someone in here would know of a location.
---
Yeah. I feel like all these weird exploits latley have made people wary about trading and joining teams which is a pity.
---
Although accidentally shooting rockets in someone else's face probably doesn't inspire a great deal of trust in people either :P 
---
Yes, and I read that holotape and it wasn't the last one. The last one is from mountaintop where the overseer is attacked. BTW, that nuke launch holotape appears when anyone on the server launches a nuke, it doesn't have to be you.
---
I think having hostile actions in red would be an excellent warning method, and it would be very intuitive as it is learned behavior that both red is bad, and from previous fallout games.
---
 And wouldn't it be nice to live together 
---
Okay, I'd like to know more about your life and how you have a job making 3d models on an oil rig. Are the models related to the rig, or do you just live there for fun?
---
I would have been if I didn’t get a Babysitting gig to make bank for this holiday
---
For what we have currently, I’d rather do cosmetic micro transactions. If it was like wow (I’ve only played an hour or so) where it seemingly gets new content every few months, I’d be fine with a monthly fee. 
---
I’m only fine with monthly fees on services like Netflix and what have you that gets new content periodically, not 5 hours worth of content every 3-6 months
---
Umm... people also spend New Year's as single people partying with their friends. It sounds like you just don't want to go out.
---
The worst experience I've had in pvp was 2 players attacking my base. One would blow it up with a fatman to get a massive (300 to 2k caps) bounty. I would kill the bounty and he'd have no caps but his chameleon friend would be able to attack and one shot me with unarmed. 
---
The only reason I stood a chance against them is I had an explosive shotgun and could camp a staircase when the unarmed guy would seek revenge. Whenever the guy destroying my base would kill me he would trade caps to the unarmed enemy. It was a pretty annoying way to grief that ended up destroying my whole base. I left once I had gotten my caps back from the unarmed. 
---
It's ok, I still love you &lt;3
---
How do you deal with the rads in nuke zones? I have the same build except with power armor using emergency protocols. I really only wanted the build to kill the Queen quick.
---
You should "Inspect" those multi star weapons. Each star represents an effect, and sometimes the "named effect" and the primary effect are different, which is why your Mutant Gatling says it has explosive bullets. 
---
Anytime
---
I don't want to help your name is lies
---
Jokes on you I am a unarmed non pa build!
---
That’s hilarious that you think holding down a weapon and drilling someone is more effective then hitting them once. Maybe this is good against low level mobs but you ain’t doing crap in PvP with it.
---
Same!  Also, how do I apply?  
---
Aw &lt;33
---
It's honestly hit and miss with the disconnects and crashes 
---
I've got around 140 hours in the game and I've had around 20 disconnects and only 2 crashes on my launch PS4
---
I've gone 8 hours with no problems sometimes and other times I've had a disconnection in the first 20 minutes of playing 
---
There's a new one that's dark wood. 
---
Idk but if you shoot me, say by to your junk.
---
I'm lvl 80 and havnt done any real pvp yet.
---
Hey bro sorry for shooting the base I was trynanlog out lol
---
Honestly the idea that they'd make more games like this is even worse, and still leaves open the question of what features these future titles would implement that would justify a server/client architecture? The creation engine isn't exactly a good platform for ranked competitive e-sports.
---
Sounds like something that really happened!
---
The struggle is real. Giving a bottle to the youngest now in hopes that it'll be crash time.  Also hoping mom will take big brother to our room and let him watch a movie before bed letting daddy game.   
---
Does white knight work with power armor. 
---
Sorry I couldn't be much more help D:
---
But for me, to find a decent acid resource I went to nearly all the locations listed until I found one I liked. I don't know a good Iron deposit though, apologies!  
---
Shit I hope it’s still there, was saving up caps to buy the serum. 
---
Until we got there

And that is because?

Damn raiders.......

You have to tame him, then equip a party hat on your character.  He will deduce it’s your birthday and dress appropriately if you drop the clown outfit and hat in front of him.
---
What
---
Right on.  A mine by a car can be a nice surprise.
---
When? I can't get on until 9pm pacific, (1.5 hours), but if you can wait I'll join you. 
---
Many said it was though, could they have been wrong?
---
Don't keep missles and mini nukes virtually worthless craft ammo instead of keeping mass amounts of steel and lead around has worked for me. Still have issues but it helps.
---
Well, obviously. Encouraging players to launch nukes is a pretty extreme case of ludonarrative dissonance and one of the few things I actually hate about 76
---
YOUR NAME IS 'TRAPS ARE NOT GAE'
---
Very cool that you got a good story out of it! The person who owned the workshop couldn't care less that I had become wanted however, in fact I had to wait till this morning to finally find someone willing to kill me! And it was from someone I had just killed 3 scorchbeasts with, so I guess I got a story out of it too, just not as exciting as yours hehe.
---
Oh
---
Great job! Looks angry, very befitting of the Enclave!
---
Server room for two?
---
Many people also claim the world is flat. The weapon did not exist within the game files as of December 5th
---
Yep, feral ghouls  remind me that explosives are not the solution to every problem.  Gotta have options!
---
This isn’t the first time this joke has been made.

Good to know. Thanks!

How does one joinncult of mothman haha
---
Dude 1.2 Million pounds is around 600 tons
---
Pc and we already cleared the silo
---
Yep. Boone County!!! Ash Heep isn't as appealing as my stomping grounds though.
---
I dont have missles or mini nukes in it
---
That is what I am getting at is that everyone, at least in this area, are either dead, scorched or mutated. We are what is left and we are the new beginning. America’s best and brightest. 
---
Its all good. I figured thats what happened. Sorry you ended up with a bounty.
---
You know, that’s an excellent idea. One of those things that most MMO (MOBA? How exactly should this be classified?) games have built in at day one, yet somehow I didn’t even consider it until you mentioned it. I would very much like to see such a thing. 
---
Just close it and join your friends if you put in the card you can continue to put in the code and launch
---
Yeah I do the same with my melee build.
---
You can definitely try!
---
I’d prefer not to be a kept man.

I don't disagree with you, but you are not taking scale into account. Old games were anywhere from 16K to 256K. yeah, you were doing all that work from scratch by hand, but compared to today's games, it's the difference between a dinner table for twenty vs. a doll house dinner table for four. Back then it was doll houses by hand. 
---
Wow you really nailed that sleazy salesman vibe
---
very good point.
---
Or be a pro and swap weapons when things are getting at close range.
---
Go to west tek, if you fast travel, go around the building to the back entrance. There will be some huge vats collect the toxic goo from there (as much as you want, helps if you have the thru hiker to minimize weight).
---
In one of the rooms nearby, there is a decon arch, if you dont have your own.
---
Just start chugging toxic goo, and then jump in the decon arch to reset your rads until you mutate.
---
Its a little more tedious to do this with a pre existing mutation, since youll want to swap starched genes in before you get in the arch, but I got carnivore after the third drink, I didnt want that, and got lucky removing it with radaway (and not chameleon).
---
 I wasnt getting a new mutation after a couple of cycles (I didnt know theres a cooldown). I thought my cured carnivore might be buggy and preventing me from getting a new mutation, so I sever hopped. I think drank more goo like 2 more cycles and got marsupial, which is what I wanted, now ive got 80 leftover goos :)
---
I understand your point, thank you for sharing.
---
Thanks? 
---
I got a bunch the other day. Just find somewhere with high rads and stand in them. Let them kill you a few times until you mutate. Hang out on that server for like 10 seconds then reload and repeat. You’ll be keeping a lot of rads, but when you respawn you get like 1/5 health back. I didn’t worry about heading back up to full health, not until I was done, I didn’t want to waste radaways. 
---
Happy mutating! 
---
I don't understand why these people play the game.  Who the hell plays a game just to break it and ruin their experience as well as everyone around them
---
LoL it was a compliment 
---
Yeah wouldn't say this is always true either.  I have a bank alt who's logged out at my friends camp.  If I stash limit I tend to just unload my stash to my friend, log into my bank alt, and have my friend give me the stuff back (vice versa if I'm transferring to one of my played toons).  
---
Silos are locked atm 
---
Oh. Well that makes a lot of sense. You really gotta do the damage immediately. It’s really brutal in this game. 
---
It’s like hardcore mode on bf or cod.
---
 Wendigos ... do not like bayonets. ;)
---
This happens at times on ps4 as well since launch sometimes running sideways works as well. I put it down as either server lag or ap regen kicking in.
---
You and me both buddy. Worst house guests ever.
---
As far as I can tell, it does not affect Radaway or other aid items. But I’ve got a lot of mutations going and haven’t tested objectively, so take it with salt. 
---
When are you on? I still havent managed to get one lol
---
Usual suspects for weight:
---
Missiles/Grenades/Fusion cores - ammo weighs a ton.
---
Chems are stupid heavy - Stim packs and Radaway in particular, but they all add up.
---
Water/Food can weigh a 1lb apiece. 
---
Inert Flux/Hardened Mass/Nuke Zone stuff is all heavy as heck at 1lb apiece.
---
Lots of junk weights .1 lb a pop - if you're no careful you end up with 20 lbs of asbestos.
---
Gunpowder and Ore sneak in there as well because you have to purposefully remove them if you're not actively crafting.
---
Power Armor pieces not on a frame.
---
Rifles, 2-handed melee, and heavy weapons are all stupidly heavy.
---
Heavy armor can weigh 12 lbs a pop.
---
Unfortunately, this isn't a game that really tolerates a lot of hoarding.  Getting a buddy and making a mule for stuff like flux helps.
---
IIRC a terminal in the Whitesprings says New York and Boston were hit.
---
When your done dressing your wendigo up like a clown, we are all gathering by white springs for a snipe hunt! come join us!
---
Yeah honestly my explosive Gatling is so op it’s silly. I want them nerf them ASAP. 
---
May seems harmless. It could be intruding to the owner having someone use their stuff. Are you gonna let some stranger into your house to use your sink for their dishes?
---
Plus (after experiencing a lot of PvP at my base and others), it’s best to have crafting and stash boxes locked away so any griefers can’t store junk as easily before raiding base. I’ve blown into many bases but before I start, I’m using their benches and stash to store all my junk.
---
Could be worse. I found him after hopping for almost two hours, and a passing level 7 killed him. 
---
Just message someone on the map and ask them to kill you and don’t go to your camp until that is off your head. A lot of douche bags will destroy your base after they kill you. I agree though they need to do more. I’ve been wanted for what I though was nothing. 
---
So I’m basically screwed then. :( 
---
Oh I agree! It would be awesome! I wish you could do a complete landscape job. I would much rather do that then waste budget space placing floor mats outside.
---
Duping unbalances the rarity of items, making the game literally unplayable for the rest of us asshat.
---
Boston got hit by the edges of a strike. The actual city killer nuke was way off target. You can visit the crater in the SW corner of the Fallout 4 map
---
You weren't kidding about 20 pounds of asbestos i had tons of bulked useless stuff like bone shards
---
All it says is "Shoots an additional projectile" so technically, you're right.  But I don't think that's literally what it means, because one additional pellet doing that much damage doesn't make sense.  I'm just going to assume it's firing a second shell.
---
Google authenticator, works with Google and my uplay account. Haven't used it on anything else though.
---
I wonder how he came to the conclusion that most people in 76 are douches.  This game has an astonishing lack of shitheads in my experience.  I've only met one or two in almost 200 hours of play.
---
Most likely until new content comes out :(
---
Almost certainly no, unless you go pistol, explosive, and explosive two shot 10mm pistol.
---
That's some mundane shit right there lol
---
Seconded. I’ve heard nothing official or unofficial on this. 
---
T-51 has best Damage and Energy resist but poopoo rad res for nuke zones, X-01 has best radiation and 1 less energy resist than T-51 but worse damage resist
---
Easiest to do with a full group server hoping, then whoever finds it messages the group to join them. 
---
"  (two-shot legendaries) is useless on auto weapons. "
---
If you're in a crowd full of ghouls (as in Whitesprings Golf Club) then the two shot is actually more practical. One weapon where it's not useless is the Two Shot Automatic Tesla Rifle since the weapon technically "locks-on" to the mob so you benefit 100% from the two electrical beams. 
---
Last time I checked only aluminium and lead lose weight by bulking and acid becomes heavier. Everything else only needs to be bulked to sell.
---
I met this lvl 80 once that dropped me some radx. Pretty cool I suppose seeming I’m only lvl 20. Thought that counts I suppose 😂
---
It has no negative effects so there’s no need to be worried about it but you can’t be in armor to use it
---
I think he meant it works. It is not perfect and it is not horrific but you can use it and it will not punch you in the face multiple times
---
I wish I could you gold. 
---
Don’t take away from their endgame activities by disabling raiders, no.
---
To get xp by making chems
---
Oh... Rip 100's of plastic....
---
🖕
---
This finger? 
---
Yeah, just remember that guy and when you’re level 80 you could give some low level some rad x too 😂
---
Two Shot Explosive revolver with all pistol perks and level 5 demolition should do the job for most everything besides scorchbeasts/queen
---
I just stand outside of whitespring naked to get rid of any bounties I get accidentally 
---
Another answer that makes no sense.
---
I bought a ridiculously good shotgun for 10k caps that probably was duped.
---
It helps me kill monsters faster in Whitesprings and SE Grafton.
---
I’m primarily solo and server hop frequently to maximize farming or if the zone has too many players. This a perfect example of how duping “affects” the game: it fucking doesn’t and the hundreds of players I’ve run into never said anything or seemed to be bothered by it.
---
Keep making shit up, really gives credibility to your argument.
---
Same here! She just went to bed and is getting the baby in the morning, so I have a few hours of Fallout ahead of me! /raises foot
---
If you still have some, I’d take one for that price. 
---
This was hilarious.
---
I really dont understand griefers. Contrary to popular belief, they are not psychopaths. They can conceive of others feeling miffed and even hurt. True Psychotics cannot. Moreover, they enjoy others suffering, where true psychotics are simply indifferent to the idea that others can suffer.
---
No, I think these broken children are no lifers with zero skill at anything that matters. The only way they can gain sense of power in their lives, is by making others miserable in online games. The rest of their life is hopeless and hapless, and they have so little willpower to try and change it, that they resort to making themselves online gods in order to torment anyone with the misfortune to encounter them. And online games, just continue to enable these assholes...all while publishers wonder why the MMO genre is all but dead despite their pouring a billion dollars into it over the last decade or two. 
---
Its time they separated players by level. If you are not playing with friends, then you only play with others in your level range. Say, +/- 5 levels or so. This should eliminate griefers such as these entirely, since every fight will be a tough one. 
---
&gt;I had them spawn literally ALL diseased glowing ones 58+ in whitespring. There was no nuke launch and they dropped legendaries.
---
Glowing ones continue to span for a few minutes after the bomb clears. You probably loaded into a server just after the rads went away.
---
I don't think many people know about it, because everyone leaves the area after the nuke goes away, and I get at least 1 or 2 more spawns from the golf club building and the presidential first. 
---
Thank you and for the armor fact
---
Not much in the way of confirmed but there is this twitter post.   
---

---
He just had to scrap some loot from all those low levels he's been killing probably.
---
Treat dupers like you would any raider or cannibal, with contempt and rapid fire.
---
You take this game way too seriously. Ruins the legitimacy of the game? Ha, that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. Especially from a dude with a Raider tag.
---
Not a whole lot of xp.
---
I certainly was not happy to see shotguns moved into their own perk instead of grouped with rifles like in Fallout 4.
---
8 left 
---
Picture please! I'm at work :( 
---
I do
---
There isn't a trade market. There are people who hoarde guns and blueprints and sell them for astronomical prices most people could never afford.
---
Hmm sounds about right then
---
We couldn't even reallocate specials 2 weeks ago, it's 2ay better than it was. It sounds like you need a nuke in your life with a good party to get those levels. Or just make a secondary character :)
---
I have a rifles character lvl 72 and my main (was) an unarmed/heavies hybrid. Now he's 140 and I can do most of the things haha
---
I had a level 208 come by and destroy my workshop and kill me 5 times for "Funzies" all while he constantly mocked me over voice chat (level 40) at the time.
---
Is the power armor station in an auto shop at the north end of the forest? If so, I do the same thing!
---
I want to play thru the nite and not see anyone irl but unfortunately not an option tonight
---
My brother had this exact problem as a rifleman until he started using VATS, and more specifically leaning on VATS Crits.  Before he was just treating this game as a regular shooter.  Once he starting utilizing VATS crits and rearranging his SPECIAL to use more agi/luck he started destroying scorch beasts
---
Sweet. Let me hop on, tag is same as reddit name. 
---
No, it's not a too many perks issue, it's a no way to change easily like loadouts issue. Even though it would be more enjoyable to respec points without drawbacks, that probably can't happen due to drawbacks increasing the life of the game. 
---
So is the circle jerk on this sub dude.
---
Outside of a TSE shotgun, a good book is a Vault Dweller's best friend. Inside of a shotgun, it's too dark and noisy to read.
---
It is but wwith a queen atm
---
You must be new to fo76 xD
---
&gt; .. That's a pretty sick ~~wall~~ whole house trophy 
---
Exactly how me and my team work but I've also been playing stealth modes on farcry, ghost recon when available and battlefield sooooo it's just my.style 
---
actually I play since beta
---
No worries. I actually meant my tag is same as reddit, invite when you get a chance. Good hunting. 
---
The exact same thing happened to me! It was in a farm house which is on the same land as a workshop. If the workshop isn’t owned you can pick the lock and take the loot without any consequences. If you own the workshop then you get access to the safe without having to pick it and can take the loot. If someone else owns the workshop then you can pick the lock but doing so makes you wanted, regardless of whether you take the loot.
---
It happened to me  because I had failed to notice that the workshop was owned and the safe looks the same in all scenarios. I had looted the safe multiple times before both with and without owning the workshop. Luckily, someone came along and killed me for the bounty and just left my junk alone, which I greatly appreciated. It was such a relief to lose the wanted status!
---
I'm gonna up vote you. Post with actual in game content never seem to do well.
---
I had the same problem! I was at a bunker in the Marshlands when two of the cave crickets attacked and killed me twice. I still dont know how to deal with them.
---
You want power patcher perk
---
Hmm, interesting. 
---
Okay, how late will you be on?
---
I used to choose based on the view, but then they needed the .308 drop rate sound I needed to headhunt lead deposits.
---
He seems nice.
---
You summon him at the lighthouse, then meet him In the wild while he is benevolent then you must kill him...
---
That's actually a really good idea. Like you'd need an extractor barrel or something. I second this thought.
---
I'm trying one kinda. Vats is crucial to max damage.
---
Anyone know where to find fireman axe mods? 
---
U'r not alone, man! Loads of us panicy guys and gals around lol. And what I found out is that we're awesome at helping eachother. Much more so than psychologists etc (unless you got a real good one.. many are just shit). Stuff gets better. Alot better. Keep u'r chin up, help is just around the corner. Just ask :)
---
did we just become best friends?
---
One day I was logging back in after becoming an Enclave General. I loaded into the server and my player couldn't move yet because it was still loading the map. Then a tool tip popped up explaining something to the effect that "nuclear blast zones are highly irradiated and I should use rad x/radiation suits/ power armor to survive. I said to my friends in the party "huh that's weird why is it explaining to me how fallout works?" Then the game finished loading and I immediately died from radiation. Because I had just gotten the general rank in the Enclave I was admiring my new uniform and now wearing any rad protection. Well.....that's how I died.
---
I’m a super impatient gamer, and the worst part about sleeping to me is how you can’t do anything while you’re sleeping. Like I get it, it’s like real life, but I’d really like to browse my pip boy and plan out my next move, rather than wait a minute to wake up. 
---
I've been waiting for the hubby to go to bed so I can fire up some Fallout. 
---
Oh that is MESSED up!
---
I already have made mistakes. I really realized it at about 23. I was building for the weapon I was useing most and had access to so I shifted focus now I'm 44 and kind of fucked. Anyhow maybe respec should be something that's is hard to do and only available once, and again after a major Nerf or patch update. I know some of this has been said. Just another opinion.
---
OH DAMN!! What time will this be?
---
Hold my beer
---
Mostly open. I have a separate building for the fusion reactor that is locked, as well as a rad scrubber.
---
You aren’t understanding my point. I was just giving him 300 caps for the hell of it, the fusion cells have nothing to do with it 
---
I'm on rn
---
If they were split apart for individual sale I would’ve probably bought something.  That’s the way it should be done.  I don’t have a problem with the atom store in general.  If it provides me with free game content for the game then I don’t care.  But I don’t want to spend a bunch of time/money for a bundle.  Break it up and make it reasonably priced and I’m good to go.  If things are reasonably priced I don’t even mind kicking in a few bucks every now and then to buy something.  The emote pack that just changed the symbol without changing the emote was pretty lazy too.  That was what, 800 atoms?
---
I actually didn’t know that...
---

I have always been Relay luck with RNG in MMO's. It use to piss my wife off to no end... lol I also have an the X-01 Jetpack and 1 Shock leg :D
---
Switching styles is what alt characters are for
---
Sorry chief. I just had to get off. How about tomorrow morning at 10-11
---
There is a legendary affect that makes your armor weigh 90% less and lets you use the mutation while wearing that armor. 
---
No nukes can be launched tonight
---
Nah there's a good chance you'll be back in the same server now, i was shopping for plans but saw the same inventory at pleasant valley. 
---
Well Bing bong a long to you.
---
Nice story doesn't work
---
Okay, I'm probably not gonna be on till later. If you happen to be on still I can message you.
---
You can add flair to your account on this sub
---
I'll add you! 
---
No problem :)
---
Oh...is this reset day?
---
Bulk actually increases weight for most of the junk btw! It seems like youre saving space, but its just because of the plastic thats being lost
---
Textwall = boring
---
Yeah I got griefed at least 10 times in the last 2 days.
---
The trade market is a rough thing right now because it's hard to do anything in game to spread awareness. But that will change with time.
---
The lag and crashing is a huge issue for me. For example, what vendors are selling is unique for every server. So if the game crashes before you could buy something you're screwed. The most painful ones are when I needed to around doing events or selling to other vendors to afford something.
---
Ok time to go scrap most of it
---
MEEEEEEE
---
Pics or it didn’t happen 
---
Whoooooweeee! 10-11 your time (EST). right babe?
---
Wew lad
---
How many people are you picturing playing Fallout 76? A few thousand? Lmao
---
I have a Grognak axe that has a 40 or 40% faster swing speed does 30% more damage to scorched and another affect I don’t currently recall.
---
My purifiers. I need water.
---
Not sure why, bethesda also posted on ig for people to meet at whitesprings station, maybe its so people dont nuke it all night long
---
I never play pvp, what’s wrong with it?
---
It’s a holiday
---
I got mine tonight too 
---
Can’t anymore the game crashed
---
So two shot &gt;bloodied/armorpierce?
---
Why not both?
---
Oh. That sucks
---
I always try to do this as well. I have noticed high level players usually will accept invites but have no interest in the workshop lol. 
---
Just came across something like this actually built into the game?! Freaked me the fuck out-- look at the Kanawha County Cemetary (North of the Nuka Cola Plant along the Ohio River) and the Church next to it. I recommend looking at it if you'd like a scare.
---
Shes dead im home cooking her
---
Exactly! I feel like mutations are more of a high level experience also and this could help spread it out and give those level 3's that are new to the wasteland a chance to join the herd of Power Armor players leaping above them from rooftop to rooftop. 
---
Even just a two shot 10mm can be viable with the right build. Someone posted a video of themselves taking down a scorchbeast and a legendary ghoul horde at the same time with one
---
And the Raider tag impacts what he said how? And nice way to gloss over the lag and server crashing issues. 
---
***Laughs in RTgame***
---
Also keep in mind that perks dont affect stash, so sometimes it seems like aid and some junk barely weigh, but thats because you have perks equipped to reduce it, and then besides that lots of weapons and armor may seem good but youll come across them often, best to just sell them off and not keep em
---
So if I have chameleon and don’t want it on all the time, all I have to do is equip armor, right?
---
Oh...I obviously wasn't paying attention.
---
I know perks dont work in the stash I figured it out with ammo
---
What system are you on?  I launched one earlier and have seen two at whitesprings today.
---
call me crazy but what if theyre planning a server-wife new years nuke event?
---
Wow. Just FYI, the most common disconnect from late game is a nuke launch: 20-120min of robot slaying and pain in the ass questing culminating is either a nuke launch or a crashed server, sometimes in the range of 50/50 Chance. 
---
If you’re steaming now, you’ll be boiling later. Maybe set the game aside until it’s stable?
---
The third would need to be instigating, penetrating, or some sort of damage (mutants/assassins) for deal.
---
What exactly am I looking at?
---
New Year’s Eve is hell of a drinking night am I right? 10-11 eastern time
---
Only good scorchbeast is a cooked one, I suppose. Though I have to admit I’d be pretty hesitant to eat that... anyway, yeah, logging in. 
---
There is a place near white springs l cant remember the name of. It has a 30 rad/sec pool and then a anti rad gate inside a door like 20 feet from it. Theres a ton of mole men around but if you sneak it's not an issue 
---
Gee, maybe because I didn't have something negative to say about those? That doesn't mean I don't agree with that. You could have left it at that and not have been so dramatic about an exploit. Don't blame the players, blame the devs for putting out a less than stellar, to say the least, product with almost no support since. 
---
Before you say anything dumb i'm Level 114 and play almost daily and also never exploit anything. 
---
I think if you commit a "Crime." I exploded a car once for fun and it unleashed a chain of explosions and then all of a sudden I see dozens of Mr. Gardeners or whatever they are called swarming towards me.
---
Your answer is why the economy is fucked, have a great 2019.
---
I got my full set of T-51B just server hoping in Watoga.  There are like 4 spawns very close and high chance of T51b.
---
What platform? Because I was in a server earlier that had three simultaneous overlapping blast zones, and lots of players congregating over there, and yet I just went about my own thing without any issues, infact, nearly every day for the last couple of weeks I have been in a server with someone launching a nuke, sometimes two - three times in a single session, and it has not affected my ability to play.
---
Nvm! I just opened the link! Lol (facepalm) thought the link was for the pic...

I have an arm you can have. 
---
I’m PS4. Dm me your tag. I’m not home right now but I’ll just give it to you. 
---
I'd rather optional microtransactions that do not affect gameplay and are completely cosmetic. 
---
I am fully prepared, as someone who already paid full price for this game on release and has enjoyed all 150+ hours playeed, to pay roughly $30 per major expansion similarly to how ESO functions. I prefer this than than the structure of most other MMOs (monthtly billing) as I personally see myself saving money.
---
Also speaking as someone who bought FF14RR  at full price, paid like $10 or $15 monthly (for maybe a year or two), then bought the first expansion, Heavensward, at $30. Total spent was maybe $210 before sales taxes and assuming the monthly subscription was $10 for a singular year. Yes, I had a ton of fun in the game but, no matter how I cut it, I couldn't justify myself spending that much a year on a single game, especially since content isn't shelled out as often.
---
The Responder Vendor Bot definitely has it. He spawns at Charleston Station next to the shack between the river and the station. 
---
If you fast travel there, run along the tracks and cross the railroad track bridge and run back to that area. If anything other than the vendor spawns there (because I’ve gotten; ghouls, super mutants and other random baddies) server hop and try again. 
---
I just got him to spawn and I was able to get the plans just before some level 17 came over and killed him...
---
I hope this helps! 🤙🏽 
---
DrSparka: Yup - you're right. Bad card design is just that, bad design. My response doesn't take such issues into account (which it probaby should). I'm just so sick of these people spreading false information about these kinds of issues. Software, as you say correctly, relies on hardware performing as it should. :)
---
I hope you were able to clean the chair.
---
Lemme double check, but I think I got 2 barn plans, ill give one to you.
---
Hmmm I know it’s not instigating or bloodied I could be one of those.
---
76 is very likely struggling to break 10,000. Hey, best not release on Steam because people might actually be able to get some accurate numbers on whos playing this garabge.

Can I still raise my hand if she gave me 76 as a gift?

I launched one earlier today too, but I keep getting this message. I'm on PC

Not quite as up there are yourself my first game being snake on intellivison 2 but still down to play with someone who doesnt have 24/7s and mommys paychecks backing them.  Kids go to bed at 7:30 EST I am usually on shortly after that and then just random times on weekends.
---
Lmk plz!
---
Just the other day I spawned in at the golf course and I heard the sound effect for an incoming nuke. I picked up the quest, and I see that I have 12 seconds to run back into the enclave bunker.   
---
Now, LATER I discovered that the door to the bunker in front of you when you fast travel also takes you into the facility. So, knowing I have 12 seconds, I only know one entrance, and that's the main doors. I book it, thankfully I wasn't encumbered, and sprint to the door. It was a moment I wish I could have recorded, because I technically ran out of time.  
---
Just as I'm about to crest over the Whitespring bunker's main doors I see the time hit 0:00 and the screeching violins begin to fill the air. I know I still have moments before the bomb lands. I turn around, slamming my "E" button and... loading screen.  
---
When I spawn inside the bunker, I was SO CLOSE that the game loaded in the cloud of orange/brown in the blast radius, and for a moment I couldn't see in front of me. When the cloud vanished, I was left shaken... but still standing. I'm glad I didn't know about the "side entrance", because it would have been far less climactic! 
---
Dont listen to him! Just get irradiated. Pop on the 0erk card that let's you do radiation damage and the drill, chainsaw, and mr handy become the most epic and annoying pvp weapons ever!!!!
---
Yes I have all the mutations and don’t even notice it because I use power armor 
---
This post has been made twenty other times saying the same things. 
---
“I love this game and I know it has bugs and it’s not perfect but xyz” etc etc. it’s literally the same shit every time 
---
Exactly! 
---
Which reminds me...i have free untracite explosive vent plans x5
---
This helps... Thank you! 
---
On PC here, too. This was around about 2pm-4pm Eastern (US) Time. I dont know if it was just a particularly crowded server...but wow was lag bad. Actually got a server failed to respond error for a split second, once.

This post just made my entire new year 😂

I was the blue haired girl with the 10 mm smg , my merchant character actually.

Got you correct?

Considering they did this same thing in Skyrim when searching for words of power, I really don’t thing this is that big of a stretch to ask for. I’d totally be down for this.

You can get them randomly in a cache or go to the red rocket gas station near the top right of the map

I'll launch.one at sbq if u have enough people
---
Make friends with a wendigo. 
---
Except were not, because we know that at the farthest 200 years in the future the entirety of the East Coast is still a wasteland, amok with super mutants, raiders, and ghouls. Did the best and brightest just decide to become settlers or raiders a few years after leaving the vault? We don't hear anything about the people of that area in the entirety of the rest of the fallout universe. So obviously nothing happens.
---
Free? I mean yeah, hard to argue with that, but you sure?
---
Same friendo
---
You get the wendigo drunk then when he passes out you put the dress on the wendigo. Easy solution your welcome
---
With no publicity? I'm doubtful. And generally when it comes to surprise upside or possible bug, it's a safe bet to assume bug. Maybe it's for the better given server stability since Christmas
---
I won’t be on until mid day tomorrow, i can let you know then otherwise if you get a better deal just take it.
---
I got downvoted?  LoLz
---
Soooo... I may have *accidentally* killed murgle. 
---
Yeah I’ve found that armor set also. Not sure if it’s anything more than a humorous type of thing. 
---
well I was trying to do a nuke for the first time, but apparently we can't.
---
Might have been, or I am just extremely lucky (altho not lucky enough to snag to perfectly preserved pie unfortunately) because yeah I dont experience very much if any lag generally, unless my internet decides to play up (and I know its my end, because I have notoriously bad internet which loves to completely drop out)
---
Okay lol, I was curious as finding a full set of power armor by itself is very rare but one with a message? Different lol
---
I have a nuke ready to go, first nuke for me at midnight
---
Agreed. But i can only grab 800 to 1000 an hour... At the spots with 2 vendors. Other vendors take more time. 
---
I got a full time job. I wanna have fun. But sure bang it out in 2 days and get that dragon back! My younger self would do that too. 
---
Aren’t explosive weapons supposed to be op? They’re really rare on good weapons 
---
&gt; and stash
---
You don't even need to have a stash box—your CAMP emplacement already lets you, and you alone, store your stuff.
---
Sorry about your experience. I've mostly had good experiences, but there will be the occasional grievers like this. I've had people stalk and steal my stuff in bunkers after letting me die and then bolting, people attack and destroy my camp and run away before I returned, and people try and ambush me. I'm on pacifist usually, so usually ambushes aren't that big of a deal due to the damage penalty , but explosives with sneak attack can be a bit of a challenge if they get the drop on you. It's often hard to counter that as of now.  
---
I at least had the satisfaction of one person trying to ambush me with an explosive weapon when they tried to get the drop on my after I exited the Whitespring Golf Club. They thought they'd be clever to kill me by using their weapon to detonate the cars in the parking lot as I walked through it. They did this and I ended up surviving. It actually backfired and they killed themselves in the process. Clearly they underestimated the blast radius or their damage resistance. I had a good laugh. I probably deserved to take their stuff they dropped after they tried that on me, but watching them come back to reclaim it after such a failure was good enough.  
---
It's somewhat annoying when people do this then teabag you... but really I see it as them satisfying themselves more than anything. I see it more as childish more than anything. I don't let them get to me.  
---
I haven't had someone destroy my workshop, but I also don't use them too often. It never seems like it's really worth it for me as the confrontation isn't worth what you can get from it. I usually leave at some or all of my workshop unlocked. I don't care if people stop by and take a few things as long as they aren't just sitting there taking everything as it gets generated. Maybe if workshops got a buff then it'd actually be worth investing in attacking and defending them.  
---
Unprovoked PvP just generally doesn't seem worth it to me in general. Kill someone unprovoked and you get marked and people hate you. Most of the time it's a dick thing to do. Be nice and people are often generous, help you out, and often give you free stuff or are open to trades.
---
Get marsupial and become an AC130.
---
I'd be interested but I just spent all my caps....
---
You interested in plans at all? I can check what legendaries I have. Melee? Ranged? Doesn't matter?
---
Sorry, gonna have to cancel on that. Forgot I went on a shopping spree earlier, little short handed atm. 
---
There’s a ghetto fix for it. BEHOLD! THE POWER... OF GOOGLE!
---
I thought it was like the circus.  A bunch of wendigos got in a tiny car and you blew up the car.  Quest complete. 
---
Mothman probably laughed his ass off
---
I got two that want to
---
I dunno how often this works for you, but I have never had a disconnect where my team didn’t drop as well.
---
I got a three star Grognak ace that’s 30% damage to ghouls, +1 endurance, &amp; 40% power attack damage. It one hits ghouls in nuke zone
---
Hot DAMN I'll have what THIS MANS HAVIN !
---
A lot of people got handmade on their first run.
---
I got 3 x pump action shotgun....
---
Or they're gonna nuke it?
---
Someone else recently on this sub had that happen and posted video of it on youtube. Seems like a quest that hasn't been finished yet or something and could be coming in a future update. But idk why they wouldn't just remove the suit from the world if it's not ready yet
---
Same tonyou!
---
Random encounter type thing. Doesn't happen for everyone but it's cool when it happens. I've yet to see it but I've heard about it. 
---
My buddy did the too, lost a couple X01 pieces. Told him we needed more iron in our diets 
---
I heard there was a junk jet in the game. I wonder if it can be used for decorating purposes.
---
She seems to be alive amd well, since she leaves a holotape to you if you launch nuke on not on fissure site.
---
I dont remember what the am 49 entry said.
---
Extra little easter egg: if you got to the end of emmett mountain disposal site tunnel, look in one of the barrels broken open and youll see a bunch of supermutant body parts. Presumably this is where west tek sent their failed subjects, seeing as it is right down the road... i think theres a terminal entry alluding to this (cant remember which location)
---
I did some additional testing and think I know why I wasn't sure it scaled with STR, I just wasn't thinking.  Most of my characters are at 15 str so the chainsaws always looked like their damage was the same.  I did some testing with unyielding pieces and adrenal and STR is directly affecting chainsaw damage just like you said.  It's just so small until the dmg of the chainsaw jumps up a bit that a few points doesn't change it much or at all from around 30ish dmg.  Once the chainsaw starts hitting the 40s or you start stacking massive STR (sitting at 30 right now) you can easily get your per tick damage up past 70.  I am thinking that by the time I get done building into it a freshly repaired 200% durability chainsaw will be ticking for over 100 damage.
---
Things I never knew I always wanted!!
---
I need to come try that event for the pump shotgun plans! 
---
Agreed, the current method of server hopping instead of actually playing the game all day is preferable. (sarcasm).
---
Ok I might try it a couple times
---
 I have been able to locate the proper files and fix the issue. They sound nice, like Santa bells. The problem in question was caused by the proper audio files being placed in the "sounds\\sound\\fx\\wpn\\tambourine" folder instead of simply "sound\\fx\\wpn\\tambourine". I repacked using Archive2 tool included in the FO4 Creation Kit ;) 
---
I wasn't aware wires took up budget. Thanks.  
---
I still have a large water purifier that's in my Stored section that I can't place or scrap. If I try to do either I get an 'Unknown Error Occurred'.
---
But soon as they land they’re made of tissue paper for melee builds 
---
Come to think of it I haven't seen a nuke today
---
Oh your right. Let me add this
---
"Something, Something, Bethesda"
---
This was great, but I'd like to point out that he wasn't 60 some levels higher than you. The level cap is 50. Yes he has a number next to his name that says 105, his progress is stopped at 50. My point is that explosive legendary needs to be reworked in pvp.
---
Quality Shitposting
---
On a side note .. pick some perks
---
Even less reason to go low dps pistol spec.
---
I just tried to get into the silos about 20 minutes ago... wouldn't let me in.
---
Apparently this is why... https://twitter.com/Fallout/status/1079814471969853440
---
I know how to make one wear lingerie but not a clown outfit
---
Hazmat suit so far. Ill let you know if i figure it out before bethesda does.
---
Its no problem. This ones on me. Stop by
---
I saw a post on here yesterday that said the Free States vendor (the only one with the handmade rifle plans) is glitched. You want to go to Harpers Ferry and get the plan as early as possible in your leveling.
---
That plan first appears at level 15, but apparently as you level, other loot closer to your current level crowds it out. Once enough items are in the loot pool, it stops showing up at all.
---
Anecdote is not proof, but I went to that vendor dozens of times starting in the 30’s, and at level 80+, I have still never seen that plan on him.
---
Am considerIng making an alt character that I level to 15 just to go there and buy it.
---
It’s very nearly unplayable. Just a total mess. I usually am the one defending this game, but this has been the biggest disappointment for me, and is mind boggling. Was super excited to finally take on the queen and it has been  so choppy each time I’ve tried it just seemed totally broken
---
people are "raiding" everyone these days as they run out of things to do; the lower level or least-experienced players (i.e., the youngest players) just get the brunt of it because they are easy prey. 
---
This game never had a distinct end-game anyways, but as duping has ramped up and everyone has 3* legendary two shot exploding weapons the only thing left to do is turn on our fellow man lol, and that's why i'm probably not going to play for awhile.. Game is just frustrating and annoying to play now and completely asocial if you don't have an established group of friends to play with, i found myself being harassed and bothered so much that i began to *dread* running across another player, and when i did i always kept them in my sights because more often than not they'd be looking for trouble.
---
I know some of you are all about PvP and that's fine but that's just not my thing and i think i'm within my rights to think you're an asshole if you are walking up and one or two-shotting people who don't want to engage in pvp with your stupid insane TSE or melee builds, it's not fun and TBH i don't think it was the vision for this game at the outset either, it's just all this game has right now so people are doing it
---
✋
---
I’m actually constantly amazed at how I accidentally use a stealth, I run in with melee and frequently find enemys have no idea I’m there even though I killed a bunch already then I just decide “well he doesn’t see me anyway may as well crouch for sneak attack bonus” 
---
For real? I mean I’ve got stuff to trade
---
No for me if you go to Palace of the winding Path and follow the cliff line north there is a patch of forest next to the cliffs, it was sitting in those woods.
---
Take my upvote
---
I'm talking about crafting, not repairing.
---
If you want to leave something behind, ill accept but not needed
---
okay so 10-11 am? Jan 1st? yes? explain slow.

So assuming he started with 1 strawberry bubblegum, he's crashed at least 11 servers.

What's the best way to the bar? I honestly don't spend much time inside the whitesprings building

I might have to I really don’t want to though

Don't know if she got infected, but she definitely has a Speed Demon mutation. Shes been everywhere man.

Haha...

Like a *wicked* clown?
---
During any interaction with a wendigo, you need to remind yourself that they're driven by curiosity and a need to be hugged.
---
So I just tried this and lost a bunch of ammo. No biggie but it was a big fail. Can’t just use a random person since they have to be a friend (at least on PSN) to join their server.  So then I tried to use a random friend that I have traded with and I guess they crashed or were server hopping 😂 
---
Guess I’ll go back to bothering my friends when I need to nuke some junk... or get a 2nd game
---
you can, specifically with the weapons from that quest
---
*Meteor strike inbound*
---
I found a two-shot, exploding mini-gun. Wasn't even fun anymore. Nothing felt even remotely threatening. Threw it in the stash, went back to my old ways. I have friends that still use them though. If I'm around them, I just stand around. It's not even worth trying to get a piece of the action. 
---
I’m lvl 230. There’s nothing to pick
---
Oh shit dawg. How? 
---
Brahmin pen is the same thing. That's what the name is on the plan. It puts a brahmin with a little haystack in your camp and produces fertilizer.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.

At least it's actually feasible to remember which ones you've already learned.

i know its not X-01 but i got 2x T-60 ones from the Watoga Station with about an hour of server hopping on a side note level 50 T-60 legs are easy to repair as they dont need springs or screws
---
I built a camp around it:

---
Ah, wrong sub. Whatever. Thanks man, you need anything lmk
---
This, there is no sense of playing with a team when you can, not just solo a supposed to be a difficult enemy/event, but one shot most of the enemies.
---
That is why this game lets us determine our future. We can become raiders bandits and outlaws or we can rebuild America from the ground up. Or at least this is the initial plan. This game is far from over with more DLCs to be released. Maybe in the DLCs we figure out why we were unable to rebuild and establish a new world. Until then we go off what we know, we are next to alone in this barren wasteland and it is up to us to make the best of it.

Legendaries heal themselves once
---
mine someone simultaneously plays on phone and laptop while I game on the big screen. 
---
No worries, thanks for the shishka
---
PS4 pro or regular?
---
Omg I love this
---
Least I could do
---
I always think of him announcing grafton day. "And dont forget to support my election... ha ha ha."
---
HOLY SHIIIIIEET! 
---
Well at this point I think it's pretty safe to say that the current chainsaw as long as it isn't changed, like people are thinking it might be, in a future patch is definitely something you can build around and have MASSIVE success with. 
---
Even at 70 dmg per tick, I feel like you could take on almost anything in the game. My dumb ass has been running around with all my perks topping my chainsaw off around 40-ish dmg. I need to start building heavily in this direction so I can see just how crazy this thing can get. 
---
Omg I finally decided to get around to doing this quest line, and I've been looking everywhere trying to figure out why my game was bugging and I couldn't get in.  
---
agxkahdsajo
---
Ok.  At least it's not a bug.  Thanks for the post.
---
Oops, nevermind. I think it's related though...
---
This joke was made in comments?
---
Musta been the Responders.
---
I have the flu, so I'm going to raise my hand behind my bubble. 
---
For what kind of game it is (online yes, but I would hardly call 24 players at a time "massively" multiplayer) most people are fine with micotransactions. I think the problem stems from when things like a simple palate swaps (ie the black power armor) cost about $20. Even farmers know you can only milk so much.
---
How long after the ball drops is the appropriate amount of time before you can ask to turn this junk off and play?
---
It’s in the crafting menu rather than the modding menu
---
Ah, that explains is. The Sentry Bot was a legendary.
---
I had to find wall signs to LOBBY BAR
---
Had never been haha
---
I definitely agree with others who have advised to look into professional assistance. There is too much unneeded pain and there are places set up to help. Thanks for having the guts to admit to yourself/others how you're doing, and please don't stop with Reddit, but have a look at the professional services who are trained to help in the right ways!
---
why not? we have clocks that don't work but a time system that is tracked in game.
---
I’m really sorry to hear that. On Xbox you can join anyone’s game as long as they don’t have their profile offline. I only use my shotgun so anything else is irrelevant to me. I guess you’ll just have to tell a friend to stay in the server for you so you can transfer. 
---
Theres another one at that ice cream place on the forest/ toxic valley border. Two bears wearing gas masks around a beaker. I posted a pic of it a while ago, haha like one of the comments said, it didnt do well
---
Pray tell, HOW do you *accidentally* kill Murgle. 
---
I'm curious. 
---
It must be the audio filters they used when recording the lines because it sounds just like him!
---
Those codes expire at midnight! Better hurry!
---
Yes Happy New Year as well
---
This was great love it. That guys a dick glad you were able to do something 
---
That’s great lol
---
I've gotten it twice at level 15 only. Took me about 20 server hops each time. Past level 20 it vanished and only showed radium rifle plans
---
Other then night and day effecting stealth, what does time actually do?
---
Feel for ya, I lost mine to the decontamination shower in the enclave.
---
All I got in return was a bunch of new quests and a stoopid plasma rifle. Stoopid enclave.
---
Hilarious
---
That sounds like the area I found mine also. 
---
Look here, too:
---
http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Blade_of_Bastet
---
Found the Enclave.
---
Too many Cooks, maybe.
---
I try to deal with low levels frequently, ammo exchanges or I give them any plans I can’t use maybe low level weapons they can use or sell also
---
Poor baby
---
Found them at Grafton Steel at level 45. Also was able to find them at Harpers Ferry from 15-25.
---
Cuckoo clocks are mechanical though.
---
I am, heading there now!
---
Also gotta love getting downvoted for asking a question.
---
imo the players are the best part of the game. 
---
The aiming issue in third person also occurs intermittently with my legendary TSE handmade.  I'm not sure how off the aim gets, but 30 degrees sounds about right.  I believe holstering the weapon fixes the issue for a while.
---
Most of these aren't bugs, they're just how the game works.
---
I would ACCEPT plans, but am not actively looking for any and have all the major ones I want. Itd take a lot of plans to equal the value of this gun imo (10kish). Like all the ones I dont have lol. Rad shower is the biggest one I'm missing. Besides that, just bear rugs and other random stuff. 
---
For legendaries I prefer ranged. I'm built around shotguns, and already have my dream wep (two shot explosive combat shotty), but would accept others shotty variants (instigating or penetrating). I'd accept a good melee. Any wep that synergizes well with its enchantments, I would consider. For example: "berserkers" (more dam per consecutive hit) is underwhelming unless it's on a ripper, minigun, or some wep with high fire rate. 
---
Also crit based so effects that heal or do more dam on crits are appreciated. 
---
I came here to say this! Saw it today and had a chuckle. 
---
This made me choke on my drink 😂
---
there is a pool of toxic water in the west tek building where they were making super mutants. it can be collected like any other water and gives 84+ rads per bottle.  it's a good free way to get random mutations, if you collect a bunch and go home to your decontamination shower or find one to use elsewhere. 
---
I've found radioactive water to drink.   I can get mutations easily enough.  What I can't do is recover from the radiation and keep the mutations.
---
Or maybe the key is to keep the radiation and live with less life?  I have no idea.
---
They quickly added pvp after the whole pubg/fortnite craze.
---
I’m wondering if maybe it’s a random spawn possibly?
---
Not hacking my shotgun can do that it's an explosive shotgun with all shotgun and explosive perk cards
---
Same! But no one on my server is here 
---
"Yes boss I need this Vega64... it's good at rendering..."
---
Yea with them not playing the game and all I bet they’ll take any exp they can get lol and maybe they think duping the materials and making the chems “legit” might be less of a ban motive but it’s still bullshit regardless the way they do it 
---
You really let a game ruin something for you? 
---
Cover is better than the original and youre a little bitch.
---
Is there a vender at Grafton steel or just lying around
---
haha yeah dude next time ill look into my crystal ball and see that people dont like when others build there, my bad hahahah 
---
That's pretty dank! I have a G. axe that's instigating with 40% more on power attacks, though-- which I'd say fills the same niche. 
---
I wanted to do this for a long time, but I could not get my camp to place in that area, so i just built around the dish.
---
Any tips? Or maybe a closer picture of where it is?
---
&gt; Giving a bottle to the youngest now in hopes that it'll be crash time. 
---
Whoa I know it's New year's but 2oz is probably plenty.
---
Wow, I’m getting a lot of hate for making a simple observation.
---
Or healing factor.
---
Quality costs, something the younger generation never understood. It's a very large topic of debate which is something I am not really in the mood to go into. I will say that even if I didn't stick around very long after the launch of Final Fantasy 14: ARR, I've always respected their decision to stick with a subscription model. Many years later they are still one of the most popular and successful MMOs on the market. When talking about a sustained world in a video game I think that a subscription will always be better than F2P or P2P.
---
Nukes have been disabled new years
---
I’ve had a blast playing the game, even though it’s broken...and Country Roads will always be a good song 
---
im level 82, with a high DPS rifleman spec, TSE Gauss and TSE Handmade.  Killed her successfully 6 times so far
---
Lol same, oh well
---
I would assume damage resistance is higher for heavy. Like how sturdy leather has more DR than light leather. Try making a piece of each and comparing stats.
---

Better stats, weighs more
---
all the things, cuz who leaves their post-appocalyptic house unlocked when any ole stinky raider can tromp mud all over and get his sweaty dirty butt cheeks on your bed?
---
I got nothing, I think.
---
I don't have plans like bear rugs, just Ultracite and non-PA plans. 🤷
---
Happy hunting. I'll find a good 50 some time. :)
---
I have 1 time cause never really attempted
---
I didn’t even know it was possible! Are you just trolling us?
---
Same.  I need violet flux to add calibrated shocks to power armor AND I still need the Nuke achievement.  Obviously not tonight.
---
This guy who I played with for an hour made me a full set of excavator armor, gave me a legendary gun, and gave me 500 5.56 ammo.
---
This other guy helped me grind levels ( I was level 15 at the time) by the end of the night I had grown 10 levels and he gave me a bunch of weapons, even though he had no mic. 
---
There are plenty of nice people! Congrats to you! If y’all see me on feel free to say hi! I’m on PSN: ehhnarwhal 
---
I had a little over 1000 from just playing the game and don't regret buying the tuxedos at all. Now I'm the classiest cannibal in the wasteland.
---
This isn't the first time Country Roads has been a fad and it won't be the last. Its a good song.
---
Also the game isn't terrible.
---
Ultracite and T51b are different armors. 
---
What system you on. Looking for a stealth partner
---
They are repaired above 100%
---
No I’m not it really happened now thinking about it I should have recorded it
---
Where are people gathering for this? Looking for a good place to shoot my flares and lob molotovs with other pyros in 17 minutes.
---
They should have done a giveaway somehow for people in the bar
---
I'm there
---
Hi there, I'm dad!
---
Or, you know, despawn at your camp and not out in BFWV
---
Ah he made you lay an egg!
---
Do you have a picture of it? No idea what you are talking about 
---
Is that how i tellbthe difference without wearing it?
---
Nukes are temporarily disabled for some reason. Always use the "Missile Silo State" holotape before attempting to launch a nuke. 
---
Not even sure how to respond to this
---
You have to climb on the base of it, just under the dish, the U looking thing. I don't think you cna get up there solo without jetpack, maybe with another person to build you stairs up there and then log out
---
Even in a game I’m alone on New Years. 
---
Did you bring hungry?
---
I WOULD RATHER SET THE WORLD ON FIRE THAN SERVE THIS!
---
!thesaurusizethis
---
Awe I feel the same way right now lol
---
It's dependent on your Luck, I'm pretty sure. I got one once after boosting the stat with Party Boy and Appalachili, but never again since.
---
part of the world / time zone? Maybe create a LFG or equivalent on whatever platform you prefer and get a group going!
---
LMAO
---
Hasn't happened to me yet and I try everytime I pass by one of those things XD.
---
I have seen pics though and you would think it would be better than it is for how rare it is to get. :-/
---
My luck is at 5 I believe tbh
---
Write down?
---
Oh yeah that’s why I did ammo on the test run. I haven’t played anything other than shotgun for about a week now 😀
---
Was just hoping to consolidate all of my junk and overload one the hell out of one character 
---
It happened to me either I switched servers and the elevator worked, a few minutes ago I noticed it was happening again 
---
Just like irl....alone. Lol
---
You must be fun at parties
---
Yeah I bought it would be better but I can’t complain it’s food and I ca eat it anytime I want
---
Literally any PvPvE game. It's the worst.
---
I also am a naked camper. That is why I lock my door. 
---
Thats how I usually do it, if its a legendary (it seems like the legendary effect name sometimes strips off the "heavy" /sturdy/light prefix).
---
Ok thanks 
---
One visit to the lucky hole and now I have 1000 lead, no acid and no steel.
---
To get rid of junk, I just bulk it all up and sell it to vendors.
---
Nothing other than my wife and I on ours... 
---
I helped out a guy a couple days ago I got him all the wall plans and a security doors plan and gave him caps ammo and so much other stuff and I really enjoyed it So did he and I plan on helping him ahain
---
Glad I wasn't the only one thinking this. Server hopped like 12 times.
---
LETS GO
---
Big mood
---
Something fucky is going on here
---
White Springs Bunker, Science wing ,Genetics Lab , the serum from the vendor is 4600 caps. Hard Bargin Lvl 3 brought it to 3880 caps for me.
---
I actually am hungry in game.
---
I just want my hits to register... 
---
But I would love small details like this 😩👌
---
Ah gotcha, thank you. 
---
We're here.. can't find the bar and getting attacked by ghouls 
---
Better than what the wendigo choked on I suppose!
---
I ran into a random Miss Nanny and listened to her version of Little Red Riding Hood. Got rewarded too.
---
I met two douches squealing at me to "take off your pants" at the overseers camp. Presumably all those players got filtered out though because everyone else I've met has been great.
---
Good bot!
---
I had two people here with me, guess we got our photos then they both vanished.
---
Yeah, I've got a jetpack, I just never could get the camp to go green and place. Maybe I'll try again.
---
It'd also be nice if most of them didn't look comically large on my walls 
---
U'll need to go there for a quest. No point in going through that struggle until then
---
I enjoy stories like this. I play with a combination of Marsupial and the charisma card that boosts your positive mutations when in a group with other mutated people (Strange in numbers?). So my friends and I go about our business and we had this one person try to take the factory from us one day. Alright, fair enough. I one-shot her with my wonderfully ridiculously overpowered melee build (she couldn't have had more than 2-3 endurance and I got a sneak bonus on her.) and we make sure everything's locked. So she sneaks back in using a stealth boy. She'd found a way in somewhere, we were still trying to find all the holes. No worries, I'm wearing a chameleon pieces of armor and I always sneak around. So she can't see me standing on the conveyors. She starts the capture, the turrets go apeshit on her and she dies.
---
This goes back and forth for a while. We block holes, she picks locks and breaks barricades to get in. I'm always nearby to make sure she doesn't get the capture but it's fun as hell trying to figure out what she'd done to repair the damage and prevent her re-entry. Finally she catches us during a defense and we're on the wrong side of the building when she starts capture. On a side note... did you know that with three mutated friends and that perk card you can literally leap from the ground to the roof of that place? So I leap to the roof, and over to the other side. Ran in the door we had locked but not barricaded and go mow her down.
---
We spent an hour doing that stuff. She'd come back and we'd watch her at the entrance and she'd bolt around the other side and up the stairs, only to find me mysteriously in the way again. I don't think she ever realized I was just jumping up. Never did it in front of her.
---
I love the stories that workshop brings, even if the place is useless to me except as a way to build stock for my teammates who do use guns. 
---
I guess? I was just pointing out a fact. Not sure what’s so wrong with that.
---
Smelt any and all ore too
---
I did
---
It's a quest that you'll return to later, when you need to acquire a government ID. Until then, it's only good for summoning ghouls to kill.
---
Have SO, have to work, would rather be playing FO76
---
Yup. Hoping for a few atoms in a hidden achievement. Nope. Back to farming gears. Lol. Happy New Year anyway.
---
Also would like to know this 
---
I’ve gotten 3 out of the machines so far. About 10-20 hits and those suckers are mine. It’s extremely easy on this one.
---
I have a ski sword that is basically a beefier version of the Black Diamond. It has the +1 Strength, but also has a 40% faster swing speed. It does bonus damage to mirelurks and bugs but who cares about that particular perk. Love that thing, almost all I use anymore, and I used to be really particular to my multi-hooked meat hook. 
---
Goddammit boy, you took my fusion cores. Bwaaah!
---
Spending today playing deep rock galactic by myself. Was playing 76 earlier for the first time in a while but it seems kind if empty right now.
---
Happy new years to you!!!
---
I was in that exact same situation 2 weeks ago. I know the feeling dude. Only thing I can tell you is get help from a doctor and to go your loved ones, people that can give you a constant framework. That's what got me out of this! It had been going on for months and eventually a visit to the doctor and staying at my parents ( even though I'm married) has helped a ton. I'm still at my parents RN. 
---
No one but me on my server. They should really acknowledge the fact that most people don't use Twitter. If they want to get people involved they shuttle put something on the login screen rather than the "new year, new you" bullshit they have today.
---
Oh well, not sure why I expected anything different at this point. 
---
Damnn
---
It's the whitespring station
---
I can’t even find the bar 
---
That could be why my quest hasn't completed.  I picked up the post-nuke launch tape way before the B&amp;B tape.
---
Hey you still got it?
---
I'm also approaching the 200 hour mark by now, the worst I've found was people in whitesprings setting up turret camps or running with explosive shotguns taking all the exp for themselves. I have NEVER had somebody shit talk me out of nowhere, try to bait me into shooting them, or grief my camp etc.
---
Yeah took me awhile. It’s somewhere by the green side.

&gt;Let's all gather around the White Springs bar tonight at 11:45EST and get some New Years Eve photos together! 
---
Find signs on the walls
---
Did something similar in abbies bunker today after being given a tesla rifle plan have had a lot of good experiences with this community....and some bad lol
---
I sincerely believe that most of the people attacking Fallout 76 aren't doing it because it's a flawed game (not saying it's perfect), or because they're upset, or because they aren't having fun. I think they're jumping on the bandwagon because right now, hating on Bethesda is the popular thing to do, and it'll get their Youtube channel or their press site more hits.
---
Nah, the quest can't be completed and it's not a bug.

Some are. My girlfriend collects clocks and most modern cuckoo clocks are battery jobs from China. The older chain ones are becoming more and more rare, and speaking from experience, the ones with short chains are usually the battery operated ones. I'm not an expert but most 'real' ones have long chains as it takes quite a bit to actually make sure the clock stays wound, though I'm no expert. The ones in 76 have short chains so it's either an intentional design choice to make the aesthetic cleaner or the asset designers didn't know the distinction.
---
I’m the only one in here on my server...
---
I'm switching between Fallout 76 and Guild Wars 2. GW2 has the best auction house system in any MMO. Technically it's not an auction house, it's a commodity system with buy and sell orders.
---
xp from crafting them? Maybe they make chems to cause the server crash instead of boards or whatever is the standard item
---
What does the "Missile Silo State" holotape do?
---
I did this same thing. I'll pour a Nuka-Cola out for you, comrade.
---
I just got it. I gave them 10 dollars because i believe. Ill post a video in a few moments for you
---
COUNTRY ROOOOOOOOADS 
---
TAKE ME HOOOOOOOOME 
---
TO THE PLAAAAAACE 
---
I BELOOOOOOONG
---
76 isn’t bad 
---
It's more fun playing on a half empty server than it would be marking some random midnight with my wife.
---
Maybe at midnight all three silos will launch buttttt I doubt it 
---
I was short 350 so i got 1k atoms +100
---
Same! I dunno where everyone went. They were here then gone. My husband’s been saving up all day for this. 
---
I thought ultracite was upgraded T51b, apologies for the assumption. 
---
That kind of shenanigans sucks, but the player who can't pay the bounty ends up with a 4 hour debuff that gives them a 50% penalty against other players. Not much help when they have a buddy stomping you for them but at least you can be certain that he isn't going to be doing much to help.
---
I wish i didn't buy rocket girl suit but i got my suit too
---
Normal, stalking, or vengeful? 
---
If your camp is stored, then you served hop a bunch, your stored buildings will duplicate. I’ve had mine quadruple a couple of times, but usually it’s only doubled or tripled. If the persons camp was multiplied, this would make sense. But he is most likely at like 300%+ of his max budget and can’t place any wires or build anything brand new. It’s great for structures like this, but not if you’re collecting plans and enjoy building new camps regularly 
---
And people like you are the reason microtransactions exist in the game.
---
Nothing against you. You do what you want with your money. 
---
You know full well it was stuck before this post was made. My god 20 years in a vault and You guys will bang anything.
---
You shouldn't be doing that to those weird, glowing, loud... slim... flexible and bendy... weird things. Oh they just... mm so slim.
---
Don't put your dick in that.
---
sorry this wasn't the best angle for this shot, I should go back and get a different one. But there is also this that I found:
---
https://i.imgur.com/mdUARis.jpg
---
I won’t tell you how many I bought 
---
Same! My husband has been on almost all night and barley anyone has been on. I think everyone’s mostly on PC. Feel free to join his server if you want. Vdubb4
---
Just found it. All alone lol
---
Pipe pistols have better dps than a hunting rifle though, if they have good aim and can fire it off close to its limit
---
I expect nothing from Bethesda. I expect everything from the modding community. Really doesn't surprise me this game is so rough.
---
Someone tell me the last time Bethesda truly released a game without time of issues at launch.
---
They just get lucky that the y have such a dedicated modding community to fix their otherwise garbage games.
---
Yeah, I completely understand. I know what they do. Give players just enough to make them want to purchase atoms. At least your dlc is supposed to be free eh? :*
---
We know what happens. We know the BOS doesn't make any kind of return to the east coast until just before the events of FO3. We have in game form what happens on the east coast in the future haha.
---
I'll put a video up for you soon.
---
I’m on PS4, otherwise I’d join in. 
---
Agreed. All the Christmas goods should have been available Thanksgiving weekend, not mere days before Christmas.
---
It will tell you the functional status of each of the 3 silos. That way you don't waste time going to a disabled silo. 
---
They're dying of white nose syndrome! And people say bethesda doesn't pay attention to detail...
---
Doors don’t auto close, so after you leave camp with the door open unwelcome guests can come in and trash it.  I lock my doors, but also leave a chem bench and stash box out front for guests.
---
You mean IRL or in game?
---
You were supposed to take pictures of the huge crowd of people that showed up so the powers that be have something to put on their Twitter.
---
Did you account for time zones? They said 11:45 ET
---
It was just a thing to encourage people to take pictures and post them to twitter. nothing really set up to happen.
---
Here's an idea. When they introduce private servers they reveal we are in a simulation. Because we know it's a simulation we can modify it and invite other people into the simulation.
---
Have an uptoot and a Happy New Year! 
---
Shanadonah riverrrrr
---
Brilliant! I shall never do this quest without laughing from here on. 
---
To make workshops worth it. Everything we've built should go into storage at that workshop when we log off. so if   
---
 we decide to claim it again we just plop down everything we've already made.
---
That's my favorite workshop too!  Don't have any stories to match that though.
---
I went and it turned into a bar fight with all the turrets and robots included. Pretty entertaining. 
---
There really should be a seizure warning for the scorch beast sonic attacks.
---
Yeah my friends and I are by ourselves here as well
---
Drop from your inventory instead of placing it.
---
The janitor and maid bot were with me. Does that count? Lol
---
Yes
---
I agree at lvl 50 it should do around 400
---
Thanks 
---
Good enough!
---
Wait, do I not have to collect all the rings in the forest zone? I don't have enough resources to craft 100 daggers in Skyrim but I'll keep trying to best the facility level in under 2 and a half minutes. I can do it if the scientist spawns in the right place.
---
It’s 12:03 est 
---
I spoke too soon, 2 people just showed up
---
The picture in their tweet was in whitespring station with the vendor
---
Nice
---
Fallout 4 insinuates that an AI started the war.
---
I found my pump shotgun plan in a house near the first lighthouse near vault 76, so lucky
---
Nope, PA equivalent is Power Patcher under Int.
---
I have no clue then
---
Dude the quality of life is way at the end of the list with things that need a fix in this game. We all have a billion inconveniences that need to be adressed.
---
Since I dont bother capping stuff much anymore here are my 2 secrets... first, if you put the fast travel mat just outside the capture circle, you can spawn in and shoot immediately, killing most people.
---
For maximum lulz, put the fast travel mat in the little room near the front door that has its own internal door... that way even if someone is on your friend list (but not in your team),) or one of their teammates is close enough for them to leapfrog, they still wont be able to enter the inside of the factory without picking a lock/smashing a door.
---
oh no
---
If they come online we have a group ready to rumble. Add clevysauce56 
---
Well, i took a lonely photo there
---
No, you wish you COULD have missed it. It's a DMV sim, and a damn good one at that.
---
I was at the bar and two others showed up. Nothing happened.
---
My game crashed. Says servers are down. 
---
I started a new character.   Been playing for three  days and patrol duty never spawns.   
---
You may wish to check two things for your Mic.
---
* 1) Make sure under Audio you have Push-To-Talk enabled.
---
* 2) Make sure under Audio--&gt;Voice, that you're set to "AUTO", not AREA or TEAM.  I can't tell you how many people screw this up and then get angry when no one seems to respond to them...  because they can't hear them.
---
* Check your Controls---&gt;Keybinds for the default Push To Talk button, it is usually Caps Lock, but I personally change it to one of my mouse buttons so I can talk stress free in combat.
---
Hope you continue to have good days in Appalachia!   :-)
---
Wife is at work...so I'm pretty lonely
---
My mr. handy blade got up to 54 with 200% condition without any melee perks. Problem is it fell off pretty quickly, it does 45 damage now at like 190% condition. It is a really cool weapon though and I'm having fun with the electrified one despite not being a melee character
---
Yeah but doesn’t mean you have them, higher level mostly means higher chance of finding something. Me and my friend are at 100 now and only one explosive and 2 two shot weapons between us both so finding one with both prefixes is not common, and the explosive was only like a lv 30 wep so also might get lower lv 
---
I like the idea of a optional monthly fee like with eso 
---
See everyone has there way of helping however my way is making me broke hahaha maybe i need to start giving tough love.....or not hahaha 
---
And who cares if it’s merely cosmetic? Someone just sounds a little jelly OP got a sick suit and you don’t 😂
---
Check out r/76Market       
---
Ratty skirt, top hat and bottle cap glasses. Also, the long civil war dress looks amazing when stepping out of power armor.
---
You already can upgrade the Order of Mysteries weapons and armor.  Just go to the workbench and create a 'new' one that will consume the previous one.
---
Don't enter the circle to contest and you won't be PvP flagged, if you want to engage with first-shot advantage fire from outside the circle.
---
Same here. I was quite lonely...
---
There's a chest on a circular platform at the top. If you're lucky you'll get a good plan in there, but it's not specifically related to the handmade rifle. 
---
Even at level 2 it's basically a non-factor. Kept planning on getting it to level 3 but always had more pressing needs and now it feels unnecessary. On the rare occasion I do need to repair armor I have about 150 to pull from.
---
Another stealth player! I want to start an assassins group. Interested? 
---
I have never modded a bethesda game until late fallout 4 as I’m a console player.. which also didn’t have even 10% of the problems this game has. personally i think if you rely on mods to make the game fun then you aren’t a big fan of the game in the first place. 
---
In my 250+ levels I've never seen a TSE, only 2 exploding single shot cryloaters, and probably about maybe 10 two-shot weapons without exploding tags doing tons of whitesprings nuked zone farming.  It's definitely soul crushing.  Right now I'm trying to find sentinel armor and it feels like yet again trying to find TSE weapons all over again, but just armor with that stat -\_-.  I've tried LUCK @ 8 - 15 and doesn't seem to make an iota of difference for me.  
---
If it's a simulation then they can do whatever they want to fit the needs of the simulation.
---
Wait a second, my hamster are running...
---
It’s not like we were the only ones in the vault! Shoulda been a whole community of things to bang during that 25 years! At least the voices kept telling me there were other people.....
---
Only person on my server as well. 
---
Beautifully executed. The trap-door is brilliant. I use lvl0 lock on mine to lure players into being wanted. Your approach is way better.
---
If only we could make traps that could really hurt people. I spent 50% of my budget and can barely scratch people even without armor.
---
So many fond memories of this quest... DC'd 3 times at various points, having to start from the beginning each time. Im pretty sure they coded in an intentional freeze in that quest
---
Lol, that's what I was worried about!
---
Got a picture with three of us in excavator. Would have LOVED to get the picture we were planning on. With three nukes going off at once while we have thumbs up in our real power armor, but no,  nukes were disabled. Absolute kick in he nuts. To think I actually logged on for the first time in weeks just to try. Fuck them so hard.
---
The only way the attacker can shoot first is if you're in the workshops capture circle, otherwise all they can do is initiate the capture and you have all the advantage from outside the circle.
---
I was chameleoned on top of the bar for a while but nobody showed up. And my game kept crashing
---
Plenty of other people level the alt and then buy extras, so you can just buy plans off them instead. Going rate is around 1.5k caps.
---
Everybody know what he is talking about. There is a perk called weapon artisan then lets you repair weapons up to 200% condition. That second bar from 100% tk 200% comes in a form of white bar over the yellow condition bar. Same for armor and melee weapons with their coresponding perk cards.
---
Hey you making sense, we don't like yer kind round here
---
50% isn't much when you have an explosive shotgun unfortunately. They can also still stomp your base just fine.
---
Racecar bed disagrees. 
---
Just got dc on my first nuke/queen.  No one under my recent tab so I'm assuming the whole server got fucked.  Thanks, Bethesda.
---
He never actually says what the situation is in West Virginia. We are left to assume he saw the Scorchbeasts, but maybe he saw something else and didn't tell us. 🙀
---
Husband said add him 
---
Vdubb4 
---
He’ll do one with you. Level 117 
---
But putting corn in a distillery and making moonshine would be more “west virginian” than a chemistry station 
---
Honestly, there are so many weapons that need to looked at again.  The M79 Grenade Launcher, like you mentioned.  Also, things like the Single Action Revolver and Light Machine Gun.
---
Fire a flare off at midnight, or better yet, a nuke.
---
I got a ghoul slayers mr handy buzz blade. Im literally a lawn mower in a golf club.
---
You are a synth but were programmed to ignore any evidence for it. The storyline dies out because you are told you are a synth and never hear it due to your programming.
---
Nukes temporarily disabled.  
---
From Bethesda: 
---
It's roughly an hour
---
I don't know if this is brilliant or if I'm just really drunk, so I made sure to upvotge you..
---
They're disabled for some reason
---
It's a quest in the Brotherhood of Steel questline. I believe it's called Back to Basic.
---
game is kinda of a wasteland right now. my whitesprings camp hasn't been evicted for a few hops now.
---
all the better. I fucking hate playing with other people.
---
I disagree. I just think Bethesda makes a decent foundation, but their design decisions make their games get boring fast.
---
FO4 got pretty boring fast as you got wayyyy overpowered wayyyy too fast. All challenge is gone after that. Unless you wanted to play survival mode which was horrible due to everything being ridiculous bullet sponges.
---
Because downvotes are there to help people realize mistakes. I swear like 3 people have actually read what a downvote is.
---
So THAT'S why I have been unable to check off that quest. Huh.
---
I think a video game company is running the simulation out of Texas.
---
Happy New Year to you too!
---
*Bloodstained, he peeled off the ridiculous costume. He hadn't felt quite right since donning it nor had he completely understood the purpose of his mission, but he had stopped questioning the robots a long time ago. When was the last time he'd seen another human?
---
Upon removing the hat, he instantly felt a sensation like being splashed with a bucket of ice water. Upon closer inspection, he could see the tiny barbs that had been sewn into the fabric. He flung it to the ground in horror! Then he looked around. The room seemed brighter and he had apparently become deaf to the sounds of tortuous wailing until they sharply fell away.
---
The decorations hung limp and in tatters. The Mr. Handys floated about vainly attempting to clean the blood and mangled body parts. This was no dank cave littered with the bodies of mirelurks. He knew this place...he...he grew up here.
---
The vault.
---
Around him lay the broken remains of his dweller brothers and sisters. His vision started to spin and distort, but he knew this was no longer a hallucination. He shut his eyes and grasped at his temples trying to will away this reality he had created. He dropped to his knees but they didn't touch the ground. Beneath him lay one final body. He knew who it was even before he opened his eyes, but he had to look. Her face was as unrecognizable as the ruined lead pipe that fell from his grip. But the unique vault suit was unmistakable. He'd only ever seen one person wear that suit.
---
The Overseer.
---
As he raised the pistol to his head he could hear the grinding of the colossal metal door rolling along it's rusty track in the distance. He heard something else that nearly stayed his hand. The Mr. Handy unit nearest him paused from it's work and seemed to be mocking him in that same foreign tongue he'd heard the liberator bots chatter in so many times before. It didn't matter...HE didn't matter. They'd finally won.*
---
I would love to run around in my Ultracite armor but what's holding me back is the Calibrated Shocks, now if I knew someone who could build them for me...
---
Thank you! 
---
Max strength, max intelligence if you go heavy w/power armor, minimum 6 luck for Bloody Mess and One Gun Army, and 6 charisma for Tenderizer and Supressor. Minimum 3 in endurance so you can have Ghoulish for nuke zones.
---
I didn't know that was possible. Ty. 
---
Happy new years
---
Everything after the war is part of the simulation. What if the simulation ends and it turns out the bombs never dropped?
---
It kind of is massive though. I mean, look at a more traditional mmo, sure there may be hundreds or even thousands of players on a server, but also, you are limited to playing with the player that are on your server. You usually only have a few to a few dozen in any particular zone or map. You can travel to other sites to meet up with other players. In 76, the whole map is one zone. Sure, there may only be a few to two dozen players on a server, but you can pop over to another server to meet up with other players. In fact, you can potentially join up with anyone playing on the same platform.
---
So no unyielding for nuke zones? That is the only thing keeping me from trying it out.
---
I have to use a controller now thanks to a shoulder injury and it's been an adjustment trying to figure out what works. I think I've finally figured it out with the audio. I'll check all these things next time I'm on. 
---
They’re still not quite there, but it’s getting better. Let’s not forget that some of the new years outfits are straight from Fallout 4, so it’s still shit to have to buy them with Atoms at all.
---
Sounds like there's multiple, the one I read aboit was from a raider who said mongrels or something broke the legs and he was stuck
---
Agreed.
---
Just had this happen to me today. My level 12 toon was wandering around yesterday and I left her in Whitesprings, stupidly. When I logged in today, someone had nuked it. I was near the edge of the blast zone, but I couldn't run fast enough to get out. On the next respawn, I tried to ft, but still couldn't. Finally had to give up.
---
I think the prices may have crashed a bit. I bought an Instigating dragon for 1k a couple of days ago. Most traders are only interested in 2-star upwards.
---
All plasma weapons are bugged in some way. Best to just ignore them until they get fixed
---
hey where is the whitesprings bar at?
---
Thanks dude
---
I like it a lot. I would mess with endurance some they don't seem to help too much.
---
Yeah, downvotes are there for things that don’t contribute to the discussion. I’m confused as to how stating a fact doesn’t contribute to the discussion, too.
---
Hey i read most of the messages people are saying i agree dont rely on a game to hold you down look for professional help i ised to go through depression you just need to fine the 1 person in life to hold you down and be there for you. Message me if u need to talk
---
Not to mention all of the easy ones that are broken and not completable.
---
There's a field of view slider on the photomode settings if that would have helped you.
---
Quick someone get drunk and go whack a supermutant in the head with a paddle ball and string over and over...

2019 - Where did it all go wrong? 
---
https://imgur.com/a/2HdO6Q9

Almost whole server showed up on ours, but nothing happened. 
---
Nukes temporarily disabled.
---
Reverse pickpocket the costume onto one and it will auto equip it
---
My nuke holo tape shows 'ERROR! System Temporarily Unavailable!' across all sites on the server I am on, was going to do a Silo run to do some Whitesprings legendary armor farming :( 
---
If its not light you will know its heavy
---
Life is old there
---
Some ass came to my camp and killed me, i respawned and he came back and killed me again (i was super low they were 60-70 or something). Next time i spawned I seen he was using my camp shit so i fast traveled and moved camp as fast as i could. Dont kill me and use my camp like an ass.
---
Wow! 
---
I’ve just never bothered to try before. I don’t know why, I guess I just assumed since I’ve seen them open and closed that the closed ones are always closed.
---
Fair enough.  I like the game and have fun playing it.  I don't want to return it.  I have been in IT for ~25 years and every company that makes hardware or software has bugs.  I was just saying that I am frustrated that it is crashing, freezing, etc., as soon as they patch it, things will be great.. a few bugs or minor annoyances are no big deal, just hope the base game gets stable for everyone soon... maybe it will be a New Years gift from Bethesda
---
Older than the trees
---
Sir I believe you’ve had enough for tonight.  Can you please get ya dirty drawers off the counter.
---
I'm not paying for stuff that should be in the game. I'm also not paying for holiday items that took little effort and should be given to the community as gifts. Disgraceful 
---
Cause what they posted on Twitter. Sad thing was was ppl that showed up were alone. Lol. Silly.
---
How about so and I are both playing and afk to watch the ball drop. 😁
---
wasn't me bud, but I'll top you back off 
---
Zomg Fork Knife!
---
The train station has a bar with a bartender vendor 
---
It’s seen as unnecessary criticism to most people
---
What I did was found a dead glowing wendigo. I am a cannibal on my main character so, of course I ate her. Then I had the option of transferring to the corpse items which is the clown suit and mask. Upon the transfer you have to get downed by the near by feral ghouls. As you go down, the glowing wendigo resurrects and kills off your feral attackers. You of course die because she turns on you and she will take all your junk in your bag much like a real life marriage. 
---
The quest is completed upon respawning and your bag is mysteriously still there, however there is a note in the bag and the clown outfit. The note reads, "Itchy. Tasty." 
---
Congratulations you are now awarded +1 to Perception permanently, but when you log off the servers will reset this stat due to a glitch. You know, Bethesda stuff.
---
I thought it said kill a wendigo while wearing a clown costume. Like wear it yourself. There’s a clown costume inside where it sends you, wear it overtop normal armor and kill the damn thing. Mission complete.
---
I use it for a pvp build. 
---
Power armor is the way to go for Nuke zones. I dont wear armor in nuke zones like a  slob 
---
LoL it’s Koo.  Just baffles me sometimes 
---
It wasn’t meant as criticism.
---
jesus. u just said something nice. why are you getting downvotes. guys come one your better than this. 
---
I've only been wanted once and it was due to unlocking a junk extractor.  Had no idea what it was at the time or that I would become wanted.  Pretty sure previous games the item would be red to show what you were doing was "illegal" but not the case here.

Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze.

Either way people see it as negative

Younger than the mountains

Haha appreciate you 
---
He blocked you 
---
He blocked me but can still kill me?
---
Ive never seen those plans there
---
Great, thanks.   I am going to try just the CPU / GPU changes after a fresh re-install and see if things improve. 
---
Also, I am going to do a full re-install of the GeForce drivers to start from a clean slate.
---
Thx

No one but a janitor bot showed up on my server.

Lvl92 here, I always go find the nearest player and drop all the ammo and meds i don’t want. I hate wasting shit
---
Guess I’ve got some haters? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Happy new year!
---
That's the magic of fallout baby
---
Honestly - you make a very solid point. I worry that, with Atoms being able to be earned in-game, if there will come a time when Bethesda cannot afford the development staff and server hardware required to keep it going. I only hope that they introduce the ability for private servers, and by that virtue, server side mods, before that time.
---
I always go find the nearest player and drop all the ammo and meds i don’t want. I hate wasting shit
---
Blocking someone doesnt do anything but remove your marker from their map and theirs from yours.
---
Stop being a bitch and love the game
---
No, i was at the junkyard. I saw someone was there and teleported. I didn't care if the looted since i left them unlocked and was looking for just one specific random junk type. I see that my workshop is being attacked, before i can even turn around i get a explosive shotgun to the back.  Wasn't in the capture circle was standing by the water purifier thats built there. He initiated captured, shot and killed me, then ran out to loot my body. 
---
Unless this has changed in the last two weeks as long as they are capturing and your the owner they can shoot and kill you.
---
Ah well, new year new lessons, aye?
---
Yeah, I'm glad you are having a good time OP. I too disregarded it for a time due to all the criticism, but I got on with a friend, and had a blast. I recall playing fallout 4, on recommendation of a friend as I hadn't played any other fallout before. I enjoyed skyrim tho.
---
But I remember talking to my friend about what if we could have this experience multiplayer. And now, I know there are flaws with this game, but I hold out hope just for the sheer potential it has. This could be just the slow beginning of something great!
---
Anyways, I hope you continue to enjoy your experience in this new year!
---
Second floor of the resort. Go up the stairs and turn right.

There's one in the whitespring too

You just gotta know wendigo.

FAKE NEWS
---
I'm playing because I'm a mom and would rather stay home with my son than go out, especially with all the drunk drivers on the road.
---
No your bitch ass should be fixing the game Tod
---
Bethesda should have marked it on our maps as an event
---
Not everyone knows what he’s talking about. Some of us do, but not everyone. Please remember that we’re not all as smart as you are!!
---
Same here I've crashed on PS4 like 20 times today ouch.
---
The weight is a dead giveaway. Especially if its a vanilla legendary. Just keep a tiny mental note of how much each tier ways and it should give you a good idea if its normal sturdy or heavy
---
That post doesn't actually say they disabled them nor why they did
---
Also can spawn near the overseers camp where the reenactor can be.
---
Spawn on the main white springs building. Walk straight ahead thru the doors. Walk up the stairs and to the right. Although nobody was there. They should of forced spawn ppl there or something...
---
Sorry chief. I’ll beon tomorrow morning 
---
Can confirm.
---
I got you fam! 
---
That’s understandable, they look very similar.

Dude, how do you not have more upvotes! That was **GREAT!**
---
Weird, not seen it on the handmade but I'll add it!
---
yes
---
That's lame as shit
---
Lol, that's perfect. You made me snort bubbly cider.  Nice. 
---
I think the reason he posted and why this is slightly different was that the guy followed him across multiple server hops
---
It's the new years vodka. And whiskey. And beer. And gin. 
---
What did 2018 do to you?
---
Had to let everyone know!
---
Lmfao this is literally Ferris Bueller’s day off 😂
---
Lol, you're like those people who only blame CEO's for bribery when it also took corrupt politicians to make it happen.
---
People are responsible for their own actions, the dupers are the one's causing lag and crashes because they choose to dupe knowing full well what it's doing to everyone else. The exploit in of itself doesn't do anything.
---
And yes, when you mock someone for their appearance (flair) and don't actually address their arguments you are glossing over said arguments.
---
Servers don't appear to be region locked? My brother lives in Australia and I live in America (married an American), and he has randomly joined my server without doing the "join" choice, just happened to appear on it.

Easy. He's part of the Enclave.
---
Yeah its more of an escape mechanic thing. Since pvp isnt scaled, and since full damage isnt done until you fire back they didnt really do a block system
---
If you guys want to spend new years together, add KEAZAR, let's get this party started

Fuck, AND I FORGOT SCOTCH!

Get it together

I'm going to have to do that mission

Breathing can help panic / anxiety a lot.   Breathe in slowly for 5 seconds.  Breathe into your belly and let it expand. At 5 seconds, pause briefly, and then slowly exhale for 5 seconds.   Try to do this for 5-10 minutes.  If you stop doing the breathing exercise or your mind drifts and you forget to keep breathing, don't worry.  Just try it again.  The longer you do the breathing, the more relaxed you will feel.  But no matter how long you do it, it does lower the stress level.   I use this as a way to reduce stress and anxiety all of the time.  It's relatively easy, you can do it anywhere, and in any situation and no one even knows.  I have been in stressful meetings and just done my breathing to stay calm and carry on.
---
Stalking, didn't even know there were others.
---
This is why I always say staying in pacifist has more griefing potential than attacking people because you cant stop them from doing anything. Also why I say that owners of workshops should get to pvp anyone
---
Nice job though, creative way to get him back

I'll do better next year, I swear

Your compliment on the Overseer voice actor made me finally look up the actor herself. You youngsters will likely not recognize the name Adrienne Barbeau but those in the senior group certainly will. As a young woman she was more known for her voluptuous figure than her acting. But I agree that she turned in a fine performance as the Overseer. 
---
What console are you on? I personally struggle with anxiety, depression and a disassociative disorder so I can understand where you're coming from. If on Xbox, feel free to add me if you ever want someone to play with. My GT is SoundlessAxis7 (and I'm a woman btw, not sure if that matters to you or not)
---
It was Xbox, I ended up  giving a couple of the 50 cals to some low levels and drank the nuke colas, ended up with about 4500 caps and every mod for the 50 cal unlocked. Dupers are terrible on Xbox right now
---
Probably chameleon armor or a stealth boy.
---
Theres plenty of Side, Misc, Event, Daily Quests &amp; Discovering to help with leveling up. In addition, I think most people would prefer to go against mobs 5-20 levels higher than you since this game isnt exactly the most challenging in terms of combat
---
Lol this guy is so great xD.  Lets dress up a wendingo lmfao

I read that as boner and was up for the challenge

In my experience:

* Bloom? No.
---
* Blur? Yes (In-game setting)
---
* HDR? No.

It's an utter, utter travesty in this time of gaming that a product *with* these features has no options to control them.

I will be very happy if a white-knight swung by and proved me wrong - please feel free.

Tonight while Doing some casual WhiteSprings Power leveling of a friends alt, another "above average" hung out with us for an hour..

Character B - Powerlevel target - x13 1*, x3 2*, x2 3***

Character C - "Slightly lucky" - x9 1*, x5 2*, x4 3***

Character A has a 14 luck

Character B has a 3 luck

Character C has a 10 luck, and and seems to be "slightly" above the curve consistently, but never insanely lucky like some of the other examples.

Don't be afraid to slow down and just do some exploration, running from a fight isn't a bad thing! The first 20 or so levels can be a pain so don't feel like you're doing something wrong yourself. If solo is boring I'd recommend finding some guys to play with who can show you some of the more interesting parts of the game.

Shit is so OP and shouldn't be necessary or a thing honestly. 
---
I mean they are probably right that B deactivated them but I do wish they made a post explicitly stating that
---
I have farmed Enclave for serum recipes and x-10 mods. I have seen ever mod 100's of times. Not a single rad scrubber. I can pretty much tell you its not in the game yet as of writing this.
---
Then the retail prices of games needs to climb.  Games take many more labor hours to create than they did 20-30 years ago, and yet we are effectively still using pricing from the 90's as our baseline.
---
This is why companies are doing things like loot boxes, crazy amounts of DLC and expansions, cosmetics.  They have to make their money back and fund the next rounds of development without raising the base price of the game.
---
Omg are you on Xbox? I want to help/join this cult, I have some great victims to bring along lol 
---
By the way, don't bother, there's no receivers. Only long and shirt barrel, long and short stock
---
I got 10 atoms for being there. No one else was there though.
---
Just my extractor if somebody wants to use my crafting and water I don't care. 
---
We don’t talk about fight club 
---
Sadly a rule, we must break. 
---
&gt;Does anyone have any solutions in mind to this?
---
don't take workshops?
---
Never give up. Troll till the end.
---
These people who expected Beth to actually *do* something in their own game.
---
If you go to the hwy 62 marker on the map, right above the miner's monument, and south of white springs, on the side of the road is a random spawn. I have seen that full set of power armor spawn there quite a few times. If you see a tipped over trailer, it is directly across the road from that.
---
&gt;Not everyone knows what he’s talking about. Some of us do, but not everyone. Please remember that not everyone has common sense and basic observation skills
---
Ftfy

My SO and I played together.

ah probably because the whitespring station where i assume they took thta is usually in the blast radius of a nuked whitesprings... ah well

Yup had a few 3* legendaries do it now.

Shut up Serene

Binging banging and bonging as I’m hackin and whackin and smackin.

Wouldn't be here right now if they were.

If you insist...
---
Found Trapper Arms on a random event between the Overseer's Camp and Green Country Lodge. The random event is the one with the ghouls in the paramedic costumes.
---
I envy you for being able to find so many nuked Whitesprings.

In Fallout 4 I played hundreds of hours. Always tried. Got pie only once.

Wear assassin's armor to reduce player damage, or play a game built around pvp
---
It happens ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I would have been 100 percent okay with them removing in-game earn-able atoms while lowering the Atom Shop prices, as long as all future DLC was free. I know people would have flipped their shit over that, but it was the right way to do it. Now they're stuck in this shitty spot where the it's hard to balance the prices against what can be earned in game, and people are pissed of anyway.

I have retrieved these for you _ _

Bethesda. Please hold my hand.

Welp, I’m drunk enough to find this absolutely hilarious. Well played.

I don’t particularly care one way or the other ;)

Ah yes, even though they are one of the largest components of the game.
---
Please stay on your medication.  You want to discuss any changes with your doctor before you make changes.   Sudden withdrawal can have really nasty side effects and really make things worse.
---
 Discuss any concerns or side effects with your doctor and you can come up with a plan.   
---
 And realize that there is no shame in having a mental health illness.  It is an illness like any other and anyone with one is dealing with a real illness and is not something that can be shaken off, or just toughed out.  Any illness needs to be treated.  Talk therapy and medication are two treatments that can be very effective.
---
 Also, realize that there are alot of people that have mental health issues, and a lot of people taking medication as a treatment and there is no stigma with it.
---
 And- if you see the all of the drug commercials for all of the medicines for all of the illnesses, you notice that there are a lot of people that are dealing with all kinds of health issues AND every medication has side effects, but depending on the benefits of the medication, they can be worth having to deal with them
---
I already fixed it, stupid bot!
---
If you're still on let me know. Thanks! 
---
The whole thing is i was wearing power armor, and im a tank/heavy weapon build and i felt helpless being melted.
---
No. No one likes it. Merlin is DEAD
---
I'll have to wait, your world is full right now. 
---
I just had a guy with a mutant explosive build harass me and destroy my camp for no reason. I used stealth boys to kill him a few times, but ran out and lost my caps again. I only had 200, but it sucked. I couldn't leave the server, I had workshops claimed.
---
I think the point was to take photos together and have fun, not mysteriously 'get something' 
---
Played a little FO76, played a little Kenshi, now it's time for a hefty glass of Lagavulin and some Netflix...Being single is rough.

On new years as well. Would totally drop one on sbq to bring in the new year right. 
---
Find players who are selling serums. Most of the trading groups have them. They can run from about 1k to 1.5k a piece. Much cheaper than white springs bunker. 
---
not really, no. not by far.
---
I guess its an unpopular opinion in this thread, but I like you.
---
Assassin's Creed don't have bullshit/fun weapons like Two-Shot Explosive Combat Shotgun with 90% less weight.
---
Damn 1 2 shot for every 10 trouble shooters? That's lucky as fuck. I just got my first 2 shot after like a hundred legendaries. 
---
Realtalk though why does this mission always pop up?
---
I'm a raider tag because my current character roleplays as a raider with full raider gear setup, raider only power armor and raider style camp; doesn't mean I'm running around abusing bugs or harassing players. 
---
 The players abusing the bugs have no self control and no respect for their fellow players and that is why they deserve banning or whatever punishment Bethesda dishes out to each and every one of them. It doesn't matter how many times these bugs are fixed; as long as these types of players are around they will continue to hunt and search for new bugs and glitches to abuse.
---
I have been on this quest for 2 days I can not figure it out for the life of me!
---
If you feel any better while there is no appropriate sound effect for that action, a scorched mobs head shot off that rolls very slowly down a slope into a parked car sounds like a semi crashed....do that and you will laugh forever.
---
Also sure it's fixed here, I believe in the latest patch.

If you are in a workshop at all, you had it coming.

My base is in the same spot, had it since just after B.E.T.A ended, lost it 4 times in total, made my husband trek out there to make sure it was safe all the time xD

Exactly

It's probably revenge. PVP modes stop you from seeing them on the map.
---
I had some friends over for some couch coop (Overcooked 2 and The Yawhg). One wanted to give 76 a try cause he was on the fence.  
---
He started a new game, loading took about 3 minutes (from RAID-0’d SSDs), he got in, made his character, got “Server not responding” multiple times and just as he was about to leave the vault he got disconnected from the server.  
---
He went “Nah, I’m good”.  
---
There went my last chance of playing with Ny of my real friends lol.
---
I’m level 44 and I haven’t completed the main quest line and I have to go there. Fuck this shit
---
All 3 will eventually drown if you leave them. They are kinda stupid. I just let them do them, and tend to farm them everytime I log on for the free carry weight food.
---
Sorry. Thought you meant like can't see him in game. If you can't see him on your map it may be because he's sneaking while he jumps or sneaks until you get there.
---
I’m holding you to that 
---
Oct 24 for me
---
It's sort of upstairs from the entrance, I think, I always get lost and wander around until I find it.  It's not down with the other stores, anyway.
---
Yeah I know my build has 30% damage for my rifle (took the 1st rank of rifleman,expert rifleman and master rifleman) (same with the perks for slugger and shotgunner) and , 30% damage for my shotguns, 30%damage for 2 handed melee, as well as the max rank of demolition expert so it increases the damage of my explosives by 100% counts for explosive bullets. So I'm a hybrid of sorts. 
---
You people are so odd. It's just some costumes and stuff, guy. Calm down. Besides, everyone gets free DLC regardless of whether they've bought anything from the Atom Store. Sounds like a solid deal to me. 
---
Well, at least that’s one person ;)

Daily Event  
---
500 Atoms - Take picture at Whitesprings bar between 11:55-12:05 local
---
What could have been... 
---
this is false.  Just had a nuke.
---
Besides locking the terminals, theres another little secret. Im gonna share it because someone else will eventually discover it. 
---
You can build a door in a doorway that already has a door. Open one door, then lock it with a level 1 lock. Build another door in the doorway and lock it with a level 3 lock. I do this with all of the exterior doors and watch as people pick the level 1 lock only to be greeted by another door with a level 3 lock. They usually move around the building, picking the level one locks but getting stuck on the level 3s. They build up a nice little bounty at that point and now they dont have to initiate or accept PvP by trying to take the workshop. 
---
In the back, I put Punji boards all over the halls and lock all of the inner doors with llevel 3 locks and leave one on the outside as just a single level 1. They will go to the window almost every time trying the last door and tyhats where they usually die. By then they have a bounty that \~40 caps and cant see where you are. I flip a couple mine in back to back, chuck a nade and open up with the SMG I have that increases damage with every shot. Some escape, most die. Theres enough budget to spam turrets everywhere too, if you dont use the nodes outside and are only there for ammo. 
---
I defended that Munitions Plant 6 times today against people of higher level and people of lower level. One higher level guy did get in and we had a hell of a fight, but the turrets wore him down along with the ever increasing damage from my 10mm SMG. He eventually panicked and tried to pick a level 3 lock to get out from where I had him trapped; wasnt quick enough. 
---
The door trick is so much fun...you can even build them so they open opposite ways; one in and one out. I barricade every other point of entry with fences, ice machines, and nuka cola machines. I dont even understand why people try to take it, its so fortified and difficult. Its really not worth the hassle to try and take the workshops from people IMO. 
---
Also, one last trick. 
---
If you open the front doors then the inner doors that go directly into the workshop, and stand in the doorway just outside of it, all of the attacking monsters will path that way. Thus, they all come right to you. Once its over you loot right on the doorstep and close up shop. 
---
It’s pretty simple really. There’s a certain quest that teaches you how to make friends with a deathclaw. It must be completed as a prerequisite. This was your tutorial on how to complete this quest, and awarded you with this passive ability.
---
Now, find a wendigo and use the “make friends” ability. It may not show on screen, however it does proc. Then make sure it follows you back to your camp (you may have to wait up for it a couple times so it doesn’t fall behind.) It’s kinda tricky/buggy because it still shows as hostile sometimes and it may attack you, but just use stimpacks when needed and you should be fine. 
---
Once back at your camp you must use the “juggle” emote in front of it (you unlock this by making friends with a Mirelurk Queen for the first time). Important note to avoid bugs - This must be done WITHIN THE GREEN OUTLINE OF YOUR CAMP OR IT WILL NOT WORK!! 
---
If done correctly, the wendigo will “juggle” back, and will now have the appearance of a clown. You’ll see its pointy hat clearly. It will be friendly towards you and your team, and helpful in fights too! Now just murder the fucking shit out of it and you get your reward. 
---
I'm lying, I can't make a promise like that. I can't even promise I'll do it better next week. I was just hoping no one would remember in a year. 
---
Mine was October 27th last time I checked. That was like last month.
---
Pot, kettle.
---
Sure you could, just have different ranks of that item and randomize it. Rank 1 all the way up to whoop yo'arse. lol
---
Ugh,
---
Didn’t think so. Was on 2340-0100 (current time) and saw nukes, no event at all. 
---
it's boggles my mind that the event disabled nukes. i guess it'll be disabled for 24 hours due to time zones
---
power armor does jack shit against players.
---
there's no effective way to protect yourself in pvp. even assassin's relies on the server, so by the time it tells the client to mitigate the damage you're already dead.
---
I have been playing on Xbox One for 5 days and throughout a few hours playing I consistently get 4 or 5 disconnected from server messages. My NAT is open and I have no other issues playing any other games that are truly multiplayer.  It’s a huge pain in the ass and there are not many threads i have seen. I have very very fast internet even though it doesn’t seem to matter for FO76. 
---
I'm only level 23, but I've tried to help people a lot, usually just giving them plans, guns, ammo, food, etc.
---
Yesterday, there was this level 6 who invited me to a team as I ran by. I felt sorry for him and accepted. What followed was 20 minutes of me trying to help a fyi (or thereabouts, very young anyway) to finish one of the first quests  (the water testing). He wanted some power armor and I had an extra chassis and some cores that were low, gave them to him. He couldn't figure out how to ft to a team mate, so we walked to flatwoods. Scratch that, he played around and we ambled, extremely slowly to flatwoods. Once we got there, he didn't seem interested in completing the quest. Instead, he found another guy around his level and started to trade with him.
---
I'm a teacher, so I had been patient with him, but at that point I gave up! LOL
---
Just some suggestion in case if you plan to write up that essay:
---
1. Try just mention the game took more effort to grind than you expected and duping is the only way that fits your play style. Additional reasoning like duping so you can "spend more time soaking up the lore" only discredit your argument. (Why would you have time and effort to dupe, if you already need the time to explore and soak in the lore?)
---
2. I doubt "no player driven economy and no hub to spend caps" would bring any benefit to the writing here. While this may benefit your personal end goal (sell duplicated item for caps), it can easily be used as a counter-argument that you and many others like you would bring the game economic down instantly once a hub comes up. Therefore, you and many others like you will need to be eliminated before a hub comes up.
---
3. Quotations/references for the argument of "fixing exploits instead of bugs will diminish an already dwindling player base" is advised. Since most Youtube influencers (eg. AngryJoe's FO76 angry review "...regardless whether you personally like it or not, cause one man's trash is another man's treasure, and trust me, this is trash..." then go on with clips of various bugs) bashed the FO76 due to bugs and not exploits, fix bugs should be the faster way to bring up the player base.
---
4. Not sure ending with "Time is the real currency in this game, folks" is a good strategy, as this reminds me what to my time when you dupe, which only leads to a sour feeling quickly.
---
It also sucks that attacking your workshop and getting killed by turrets lets them seek revenge. Like, dude, it was your own fault you got killed.
---
I actually think your build is garbage because theyre fairly easy to kill, might be because your gun dont have the right mods or damage (level 40 is usually a tough level because you start getting high level enemies.)    and btw there are no lvl 50 wendigos, max levek for them is 42
---
You left out Martial Artist. Useful for anything using Gatling and Laser Gatling.
---
If you can scrounge up Sentinel legendaries they're great.
---
Ammosmith + Super Duper, of course. Science perks if you want to build energy weapons. Fix It Good and Weapon Artisan.
---
Scaly skin is a great mutation, but add Class Freak and Strange in Numbers. If you're a solo player get Lone Wanderer for the damage buff.
---
Yay I got it guys thank you :)
---
depends on your int. and these minigames have always been stupid, if you pass the check you should just unlock whatever.
---
I don't understand this stance. I see it in every single thread about the Atom Shop. The most successful mmo ever ran (well...still runs I guess) micro transactions very successfully and with little pushback from the player base or critics. People paid full retail price for the game, paid $15 a month for access and paid full retail price every 12-18 months for an expansion. People were more than happy to spend $5-25 on pets, mounts, transmogs, etc.
---
Nearly every mmo after WoW has tried to duplicate it. Why would a company not offer non essential items for a fee. Most people have zero interest in the item, but it will make a small percentage of the player base very happy.
---
Sneaking around being all sneaky with a scope, saw movement, aimed and shot. Got up to it and saw I murdered a cat. 
---
I mean, you’re here. The people upvoting you are here. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Seems we’re all in this together.
---
This is y I just use single shot bc this hasn’t been clarified. It may be just the first bullet, but I’ve been wrong before.
---
Are you PS4?  I  dropped off a bunch of plans to a low level player today.
---
It wasn't about microtransactions or not, it was the pricing of the cosmetics, the previously free Fallout 4 assets on the store, and the fake sale that they put up to mislead consumers. Most people are fine with microtranscations just not the way Bethesda went about it.
---
There's also a thing where they can get killed by your defenses while you're away, on purpose, say they want to seek revenge, loot their stuff, then come find you wherever you are and OHK you while you're not paying attention.
---
Getting killed by the defenses of a shop you attack should _not_ allow revenge.
---
I mean. Take off your pants. All problems = solved 
---
Wrong bar
---
Oh, you again...
---
lol most of the ash heap was super easy for me, so I thought "Oh, going to lewisburg for a quest. That'll be easy." like 11 super mutants chucking grenades and attacking me, even when I loaded up my 2 d-pad switching black powder pistols, and with another random a little lower level than me, we still got destroyed.

The apple of eden is a lot more fun than some tse  crap.
---
I don;t think you can set up a water purifier on a toxic pond. I seem to recall trying that about a month ago. It wouldn't make sense if you can't boil it either.
---
I know how you feel.  I dropped off 10 Handmades (one supped up one, and 9 to scrap) and it drained me of springs ... a trip to McClintock and Sugar Grove got me back over 80 though.
---
Probably not since they weren't disabled for Australian New Years. Had three blast zones overlapping on my server at midnight
---
There’s so many rooms in the game, what room?
---
Might go up by play time
---
Ddn't even know an event was going on; they should have announced something on the actual game itself instead of just twitter and had it setup as a quest or something. Ah well next year I suppose.
---
I knew you were full of shit from the very moment you began arguing against a definition.  
---
&gt; The game itself is what reduces the piles to mush in order to prevent strain on the gpu, and additionally, the servers. 
---
This statement implies that somehow the meshes loaded on your computer are weighing down the server.  They're not.  There is no server side graphical representation of the game.  Think about your machine running the game.  Now imagine there's a server graphically representing every inch of the map all the time.  The ram requirements alone would be outrageous.    
---
&gt; Me: certified IT networking and coding whiz 
---
Giant red flag.  No IT person would ever say something like this.  We would say we're CompTIA A+, Network +, Security +, CCNA etc, but we would never make up a generic "I'm certified" statement.  Why?  Because we're proud of our certifications.  
---
And that's what it looks like when a faker gets destroyed.  Blocked and I'm going to go ahead and ignore this thread.  
---
Another thing that I have been told and I hope can help you or anyone here is --  take a minute and focus on what you have to be thankful for or you enjoy --- for example, you have an X-Box, Internet connectivity, a game you enjoy, you have been able to reach out and receive help from fellow gamers.    Think of anything else that applies to you.    
---
I think any activity that helps you feel better, gets you out of your head (a good distraction from worry/anxiety is a good thing.   
---
Exercise of any kind is also really good for your mood. A walk, jumping jacks, you name it -- it helps burn off the stress hormones.
---
I heard a funny or stupid saying once-- why do zebras not get ulcers?  -at the first sign of stress, like a lion, they run there ass off until they are exhausted.  They burned  off all of the stress related hormones that cause anxiety.  meanwhile, us humans worry all of the time (chronically) and don't always burn it off, so some exercise can really help.
---
My last suggestion---&gt;  avoid caffeine altogether.  It is like gasoline on a fire if you suffer from anxiety and panic attacks.   If you do quit, taper off so you don't get awful headaches.
---
Happy New Year! 
---

I think that was just social media PR. There was no special event

so he was an asshole? should've just blocked and hopped.

not sure i'd call it an event - there was nothing there.

Massive is subjective, compared to 1 person, 20 is massive.  Compared to an ant humans are massive.

I get you that FO76 doesn't fit the standard MMO tag, but neither do a lot of games with that tag anymore.  You encounter the same amount of people if not more on FO76 then you do on elite dangerous.

---
I've got 160 hours and have never been griefed once. Perhaps your behavior is part of the problem? 
---
Would be nice if the entire server didn't crash, but sadly I think it usually does.

New Years treating you well friend?
---
Eh dont care games garbage unless u got friends and dont see why people complain when people dupe unless they hoggin an area or being assholes bethesdas fault for a buggy hell if i could dupe i would but dont see much of a point at the moment to even try and risk getting banned 
---
In all fairness, I consider MMO to have some progressive RPG mechanics and quest lines that multiple people are able to participate in at once.  Now I'm no subject matter expert, but I have been playing MMOs since Ultima online and ever quest, the games that built the genre and IMHO sorta define what an MMO is.
---
So I guess that makes that Hank? 
---
Its thru the main entrance. Go right up the little stairs past the doors and make a right
---
What event and Nukes are disables?
---
Ikr, why does Bethesda have to be so obscure about the actual game mechanics like this? *sigh*
---
You probably could. I live in Grafton and apparently the big thing here for new years a bit ago was to pop off a bunch of gunshots all over the hillside. You could get away with it...
---
Literally Unplayable 
---
I could try, make sure you read the comment thread on here talking about it. Only way to do it is though an unconfirmed glitch that was thought to be on PS4, we can surely try tho. 
---
You never completed the event so it is counted as a fail since you were removed from the server; fail = lose what you invested.
---
Good luck getting this answer from them lol. DM me if they answer it though lol
---
Just have then always dropped equipped weapon plus 1, easy enough to implement and solves the feels weird moment when they dont have the proper weapon. Btw I have noticed leader mobs almost always drop their weapon plus 1 more, super mutants with mini guns drop them and 100ish rounds of 5mm ammo,  it's how I farm ammo for my gatling most the time.
---
Mine was Bobby Pins at dollar store.
---
You are not alone friend.
---
Seems misleading to have a receiver category and not have any other receiver. Well, that's another strike against it.
---
That didn’t show up in my challenges :/ if it had I would have gotten it because we took a picture right at 12:00 local time.
---
pretty sure i saw one in watoga on a roof, the building with the face
---
I'm married and playing. Took a break to watch the ball drop with the family. Now everyone is tired. Gonna go back to it, I think!
---
Like all the other legendaries.
---
I would argue it is more then amount at one time in an area rather than how make people can cycle through as spots open up. otherwise things like mobile poker games could count as mmos and it then sorta loses its meaning as a term.
---
but my point still stands. people would be fine with the microtransaction model if the pricing wasnt absurd. 
---
Yeah, that LMG seems way too weak for its high level requirement and expensive ammo. Should be at least double the damage.
---
Happened to me and a couple of guys on my team...we searched for like 20 minutes until he came and attacked a friends camp so we all hunted him and completely ruined him. 
---
I’m sorry that happened and it completely sucks. 
---
Once I got to lvl 15 I decided to just explore, collect and start mayhem. Didn’t get back to actual questing till I was 40. Had a blast and now the quests are generally easy and fun.
---
They need to prove they are committed to adding content before this is even worth discussing.
---
I saw a level 27 today at Monongah. There was a defense event. It happened to be a Scorchbeast attack. No one else was there, so I fast traveled over to kill it.  Im not using some maxed out build that can kill them quickly, either. The thing I do have going for me is a Quad Double Barrel with extra limb damage and the crippling perk. Once she landed I just kept pumping shotgun shells into her, swapping to the 10mm that ramps up damage with every hit between 8 blasts to the wing. Killed it, but used way more ammo than I wanted since the whole point of me being on was to stockpile ammo. 
---
Dude was hiding in the building; he came out, gave a heart, I gave a pew pew pew and bounced. 
---
No, I'm on PC
---
Scortch
---
No I wish not to be on FBI watchlists

If you're on ps4 I can sell them to you

Is anyone else missing the option to initiate search for silo codes from the  surveillance system terminal? I'm only seeing the option to look for keycards.
---
Question of the year. Years? 
---
Last I looked FFXIV had one hell of a cash shop. WoW does too. Hell WoW has even started selling gold (with a bit of a middle man via the auction house).
---
Subscriptions may cover the cost but it doesnt line the pockets near enough it seems.
---
...no? By definition of the lawsuit, soulja never had the right to distribute that console under his name, so any opportunities from his console were invalid. Also, wasn't it just playing retro games? Like, NES/SNES/Genesis? I doubt that thing would have been able to run even fallout 3, much less 76...
---
"picture event" is a pretty grand title for one tweet.
---
Run melee....
---
Also in all fairness explosive guns make it easy as well, how much easier stealth builds become with a 2 shot explosive Long range weapon is funny.
---
Not one aside from trapper
---
How new are you to the game? 
---
I guess. Also with the right perk cards, leap of faith is also possible.
---
That’s pretty much it. 12str/12per for the damage perks and whatever else you feel you may need to supplement it. Mutation, charisma, crit, anything you want can work
---
I've been searching various forums for a while and my main question remains unanswered:  is there a min level for a power armor frame? twice I've found frames with a couple parts I couldn't use and unequipped them and then entered, exited, and stored both frames
---
Playing since beta
---
Mine was 28th a couple weeks ago but I haven't checked recently, I did play during beta but I've only played casually since then.

Damage resistances of armors are affected by your INT stat when crafted.

European or African swallows?

"Adopt a noob"  I had a friend hit L15 that had only stayed in the Forest and I took him on a tour. Whitesprings (he was a kid in a candy store at the mall), Abbie's Bunker, Welsh Station the Watoga Station, basically unlocking his map then gave him 600 caps, a beer and a Grape Mentat at Watoga. Was about 539 for handmade plans for him. Gave him 2 L15 weapons; Bloodied BPR and Anti-Armor pump shotty with a hardened receiver and kept the change. He was stoked.
---
I thought it was just a photo pose not an emote.
---
I've had a similar experience although I don't know how old he was as he didn't have a mic. I tried helping but after 30 minutes of him jumping around everywhere like a monkey with a cocaine problem I gave up and said I needed to go do things, he gave me a thumbs down haha. 
---
That's awesome you tried to help a kid, most people just ignore them. 
---
I really don’t mind wasting .50 ammo on killing a scorchbeast for someone at all. My build isn’t maximized for anything really, I’m just a big guns user with a Legendary .50 Cal with the +30% against Scorched effect. But it’s freaking awesome taking one of them down in less than one clip of ammo!
---
Dang. I was hoping there was a rhyme or reason to it but I guess not. 
---
Something like that 
---
Mr. Sunshine on my goddamn shoulders John Denver. 
---
Oh damn I finally got what you mean. You bought 6 fusion sells from him for 300 caps.  It’s hard to understand how it was written.
---
Pfft, only savages cook meat
---
The codes are the same from last week
---
Not an emote, I thought the same at first and almost bought it haha
---
Good thing we couldn't nuke! You might've DIED.
---
I thought this until I made a new character. People are douches only if they think they can take you. If you're higher level than them , or even just 50+ really you get a lot less douchey behavior directed your way. 
---
Um, what?
---
I waited until level 92 to launch my first nuke.  Two days ago, actually.  I nuked Whitesprings, of course(aside from me on the map there was noone above lvl50), and was promptly disconnected after one run through the Golf Club.
---
It was a breeze, literally.  Just swish swish boom with my melee PA build.  Only P.I.T.A. was getting lost between destroying the cores and replacing them.  I ran I  circles for a good 40 mins before I found the correct station and door.
---
Yesterday I was restocking stims when the nuke warning sounded, and then "Scorched Earth" flashed.  Go time.  I went there and was shocked.  Nobody else was there.  Seriously people why would you nuke prime and not bother?  Anyway I shrugged and started hacking at the SBQ.  Got her down to 75% then out of nowhere like 12 people show up and join the fight.  
---
Shes down to 60% and all hell breaks loose...Megasloths, Snallygasters, Honeybeasts, Mirelurk Queens, some varying stages of legendary most just glowing.  There was even a 3* Legendary Wolfraffe(the fabled long neck, hard to kill!)  
---
Then the bitch regenerated, and people started leaving, not caring about the bevy of loot and EXP being offered on the ground.
---
Eh well.  I leveled up to 98 in one hour.  It was fun and I got two Ultracite Mod plans among other things(I dont have Ultracite Armor yet so something to look forward to.)
---
I’m actually down for this but I’m a pretty low character..like level 5 low but I’m working on it.
---
I could join with my 96 but like....he’s part of the enclave...
---
Ice expansion is devastating,  they show it semi accurately in antman.  Its gonna expand regardless.
---
Yea...sorta bummed i just doubled checked and saw it was a pose...
---
Why must you do this?
---
I just jump in the water next to
---
Blackwater mine with barrels in it.
---
Get mutation.
---
Server hop, repeat.
---
Have been very lucky this time and only need speed demon to have all the ones I want (eagle eyes, marsupial, healing factor, electrically charged plus speed demon)...but too afraid to try again and stuff it all up (again).
---
There aren't any New Years emotes. There's an icon and a photo mode pose. 
---
When that happens I just look down and wait for the dam thing to land then start wracking it with my bat.
---
No idea why people like that song, i think it sucks 
---
I only use atoms I earn. 
---
I hung out for a while on PS4, but yeah, nobody else showed up. 
---
Yes, but the left arm scout armor you can buy, has 12 dr. The right arms has 20. 
---
So was I because the court room was across the way and it showed that as my path to next objective.
---
It wasnt so long as to kill my game mode just irritating lol.
---
TDS got ya.
---
I'm telling you, we need another reclamation day in which we all "wake up" from the simulation (that many if us have read about) and all TSEs are gone, bugs are fixed, and PvP is more balanced.
---
they probably had every server active with one person at each bar 
---
That still happens. The glitch they fixed was where you'd randomly stop doing damage. 
---
&gt;mini megasloth
---
so.....a sloth...?
---
It really all depends on what you are going for at that moment.  My usual 'team perks' are XP/Speed and damage reduction.  If we go into a nuke zone (white springs especially) one guy will set up with rad sponge and the group heal stuff, because we are all clustered together to murder things.  Its gotten to the point that with a full team I can go in my power armor and stay rad-free and full health for the entire duration, which is really cool.  
---
You can also eat some foods and use other boosts for XP when you know you are about to get into a scrum.  I save the XP magazines and bobbleheads just for that.  If the zone spawns quickly enough its a TON of bonus XP.  
---
Blast Zones are nothing to be afraid of.  Trust in your armor, bring the right meds, you'll be fine.  Avoid going to fissure prime unless you can actually hurt the queen.  More players = more difficult kill.  The rest are not that bad.  If, while adventuring around, you can deal with a scorchbeast solo without too much worry, no blast zone should be a problem for you with a group.
---
Just sucks only a few heavy weapons are useable.  Have a level 50 legendary gatling plasma that's two shot explosive, but it breaks in like 2 cores.
---
Someone been watching Dumb and Dumber recently?
---
I had this happen during nuked Whitesprings. I'm a melee build.  There were probably 5-6 people one shotting everything before I could get a strike in.  It was pretty lame. 
---
And yet people still find a way to bitch about it. I saw someone get mad at this for, like would you rather be perma banned??
---
How long for the youtube hate train grabs this and uses it for clicks?
---
Typically, in my server, I banned you LONGER if you bitched at me for a ban *that we have blatant evidence of you doing!*
---
Can you please explain what that means for the quest? We are supposed to be able to access the other options in the terminal and the game isn’t letting us choose any other option except for calling in more cargobots with keycards.
---
Cool thank you.  Additionally, thank you for the SPECIAL recommendations.  That's not too far from my build right now, but I have more in INT than I do in PER, but that was from when I was thinking I might do more with energy weapons.  Since I've focused on Ballistic, those points in INT are less necessary
---
2 characters at 130+ here. I just doubled the water purifiers (all unlocked) at my camp so I can give at least one random low level character, per day, a sizable care package of water, stim packs, food, disease cures, and a Nuka Cola. I like to think it's a novel experience to have a magenta-haired asylum nurse appear out of nowhere when they first leave the vault and say "Hi, I was waiting for you to emerge from that place. Here's some stuff, enjoy the game!"
---
hahah yeah... same thing happened to me.. forget what quest line I was on... I think the Mystery line.
---
I saw their Instagram post like a few hours (est), really wasnt a good announcement. 
---
Seemed s very rushed last min thing so they wouldn't seem like they forgot about NYE 
---
Wanted to come back on here and admit that stealth has some serious advantages.  Whoever was trying to stealth grief me before did not know what they were doing.  If I were a valid target (aka - wanted) I would be hard pressed to figure out where those shots were even coming from.  Even mostly prepared for it (in armor, meds ready, and fully armed) I STILL didnt fare to well.  
---
Now, combing the shock troops and someone out doing stealth to get the kill?  That would be fun.
---
Something similar happened last night, had hundreds of screws and springs ect on me, died at white springs and my bag was stuck in a Bush and unlootable.  5 seconds after that my excavator armor broke, went to camp and realized it had used all my stored resources before ones in my inventory so had to go farm more mats to repair.....was pretty irritated.
---

---
Level 46 Unarmed. Not a lot of time to play, but willing to link up. 
---

---
Same, honestly. It works in 4 where you aren't worried about AoE damage to other players. 
---
I always try to get a hit in with melee, then kite so others can hit it so they can loot too. Explosive kills everything instantly. No way for melee to dish out that much damage to multiple creatures at once. 
---
Yeah, I don't disagree with your point. I'm fine with the atom store, in theory. If they bring the prices down a bit, which it looks like they are.
---
ressurecting this post. 
---
Yeah the little nail boards you can stick on the floor.
---
Lol, I was to busy hitting backspace over and over to watch it slowly strip the spot of the ink or whatever it did.  Electronic typewriter at least.
---
They're supposed to be rare. Go look at any of the trading subs. They're everywhere. 
---
I was lucky enough to just stumble across one in an office building. He was sitting at a desk, typing on a terminal. Easy sneak attack with a one shot kill.
---
Upon further inspection, it appears that the wendigo was using the terminal to access metacritic and wrote "76 reasons to not buy this game". I resurrected him just to beat him to death again. Mission complete.

---
Hahaha that was fun. I wish I had remembered I had that mutant's explosive black powder rifle earlier, though! XD happy new year, man! I'll fill you in on what happened last night later lol
---
Sounds cool but you know some douche would come by and kill him. 
---
Haters don't even know they can be earned, they only think they're obtainable with real money.
---
Oh, my bad. I thought you already completed the quest one time. I don’t know about this one 
---
Weapons are divided by size not by damage type in this game. All rifle sized, pistol sized, heavy sized each have their own perks for damage. And shotguns have their own damage perks. Rifle and pistol have auto and semi recovers and damage perks for each firing mode. Regardless of if it’s energy or ballistic they’ll benefit from the same perks.
---
Yeah same I was talking about the other one
---
256 and 149
---
You're correct. They're not rare now. They're selling for as low as 500 caps now. The market is flooded.

Also I think bethesda didnt realize that the disconnect between gems/energy/atoms/ect and money doesnt really exist anymore as the first thing most people do now is convert the BS currency into $$$.

If you mean Serana, I’m tired of all these caves and the sun is such a bother.
---
I understand the aggravation there, but imagine running in to a Super Mutant Primus with a 2 shot explosive minigun. Don't think many players would be happy at being instagibbed.
---
Level 21; I've run into 100's of players; only 4-5 have attacked me.  1 was a bounty I chased, which to be fair I instigated.  A few have just fired and I ignored it and went on my way.  1 guy at the dirt track had mad turrets set up and shot at me until I shot back, when the turrets also got me.  Got revenge though, so kudos on the setup to them.  
---
It seems to me that if you just mind your business, most all players will let you.
---
Odd suggestion, but if you're trying to make "you" in the game, have a friend do it. They don't really need to get the game much. My character went through like 5 transformations of what I thought I looked like until a friend edited it. Now I swear to god I'm staring in a mirror every time I play, it's uncanny
---
Thank you.
---
Don't engage in PvP.
---
mind if i add you in game? 
---
That is rough. Do you have the weapon repair on hit perk? It won’t solve the problem but can help a bit.
---
That is a good picture you have taken. Honestly i would probably name it something like "Daily life in the nuclear household"
---
When a Power Armor finishes a fusion core and inserts the next, can we please have it select the next lowest rather Han next highest? I should not be wasting so much space on half full cores and would much rather use them first.
---
Nukes are disabled. Area around Whitesprings is spawning mobs and flowers like it's in a nuke zone. Sometimes the ghouls are robots too..

Nah the flaws and glitches really do keep it from GOTY but it is no where near as bad as the youtube hate train made it out to be.

Events
---
I feel you all to well. Before I turned on pacifist mode, I was checking out this one persons camp and some wild dogs started attacking me and his camp, I shot the dogs but also accidentally shot his wall giving me a bounty. Had my spouse kill me to get rid of the bounty. Another time spouse and I were meandering around and found a claimed workshop, just passing through and we saw some red tanks, shot at them to make them blow, ended up with a bounty. I killed him this time to make it go away. They really do need to figure out a new way for PVP, because even with pacifist mode on we can still get griefed by higher level players.
---
This is the first thing I noticed at the factory, but then again, I click lock literally everywhere any time I build....

Lol, yes rank 3 along with 200% repairs and rank 5 gunsmith.  My gatling gun lasts pretty long and is my go to gun, but most other heavy weapons are brutally destroyed when killing mobs and break super quick, just like my 2 shot flamer does.  Both stay in the box waiting for a hopeful fix.

I think all this has done is highlight the problem of having no community support in the game.
---
I leave my doors open with a welcome note next to it. Yet no one ever uses my place because it is hidden too well, but I don't want to move it because it has a great view, and I have yet to find a new home.
---
Ehh...my TSE Handmade does 2-3x more dmg than my TSE Pistol. I don't see the point in pistols.
---
Well they'd be dead here too, Aus New Years was last night. And I don't play again until another 3-4 hrs from now
---
Just when I thought you couldn't be any dumber...
---
ahh
---
No modding needed :) but have to see what budget I have when I get Back online.
---
I was the only one there on my server lol. 
---
Also what’s up with not being able to launch nukes? I was gonna time it to drop at midnight for me and start the year off by killing the queen 
---
Literally logged off and started reading all of this stuff. I see now that people were not able to drop nukes and the holotape says "error". Dont know how some people were able to do it. Wish I read this stuff before and took screenshots so I dont sound like a liar. Lol.
---
lol looks like a mightmare version of the deku tree.
---
As far as I know you can't clear it from server hoping, just have to wait about an hour for it to finally go away.
---
Doesn't stack w/ Speed Demon. Pointless.
---
The thing that is destroying my morale is the fact that close to two months into the game, I still cannot reliably team up with my friends.    This game was advertised as being a co-op and play with your friends game, and they have completely and utterly failed.     That is what is probably going to make me stop playing this game, not the duping.   
---
It's how I got power from my roof to inside my c.a.m.p. 
---
But I think you need to learn advanced power connector plans (not sure if that's the exact name) 
---
Not sure what your point is here other than elaboration of what was already said but the point holds true. 
---
Stop. Using. Shitty. Passwords.
---
Sorry bud logged out already
---
I would have ventured my noob ass (lvl 15) out there if it weren't my Wife's turn on the Xbox. 
---
Would love to watch and gamble on fights; also happy to pay for the privilege 
---
1.) xbox one 
---
2.) Cpd420 
---
3.) Aint got one sorry  
---
4.) I'm disconnecting or freezing about 2-3 times an hour. This is especially problematic when I decide to do something like a bunker raid, or daily mission because usually the disconnect happens after I've dumped a lot of resources: caps, ammo, stims, into the mission. 
---
If these could be fixed by either checkpointing or fixing the issues some otherway that would be much appreiciated.
---
\*cough\* you should help me out in GTA5 man I gave up on that game cause I'm broke
---
But they can't Permaban people, already not many playing lol. Can't reduce the number anymore or there will be 0.
---
Yeah, most mission rewards spam you with meds. Quickest is probably workshop capture/retake missions. Just run away from any bored high-level PvPers.
---
If you don't want XP then get Pharma Farma and go through a pile of med boxes.
---
Well for starters you might think of cutting some of your larger stacks down some to help make room.
---
I usually bulk, starting from heaviest to lightest then take all my big bulk stacks 20+ stacks of bull and take it down to 15 stacks each and sell the rest. Then I have room for whatever the hell I need hidden away at any time.
---
If you place a floor tile under water,  you can't get it back unless you move camp. 
---
It's just not selectable.  Though you can snap other pieces to it. 
---
np 
---
This is great info and useful, many thanks.  I have all these perks except ricochet, which I will add.
---
The only thing that has hurt me lately is a spawn of 3 L76 yaoguais who all attacked together.  What is their magic perk which allows them to do so much damage?  Stagger is irritating, but that can’t be my real problem.  How are the getting past all that avoidance and PA?
---
Thanks in advance.
---
Another friend actually aforementioned gambling and yes I'm going to add it.  You can leave your gt.
---
Oh ok I'll go look through for tons of stuff. I thing I have 70 bulk springs....
---
Thank you. Hope the same for you and your friend!
---
Hey, I've figured out how to build what I was referring to in my original post. Just updated the post with the steps, hope it helps! 
---
Pharma Farma is the perk card that allows you a chance to get more healy goods and the Watoga Emergency Services is a very good place to farm stimpacks. But it's also a popular place to do such, so don't be too disappointed if you come out empty handed. Also Events/Workstation defending has a high chance to give stimpacks as well. 
---
It's a meme from osrs sub.
---
True love right here! 
---
ignoring blueprinting completely, when you place your CAMP module on a nww spot, it auto-stores your base as that giant piece, one which you already know can rarely be placed. So, break it down, from the stored tab. It doesn't completely destroy anything when you break down that 'bueprint', it instead breaks it into the individual pieces that made it, and then leaves those pieces in stored.
---
At this point I break a bunch of these pieces down, cos the new base wont be the same as the old base. I leave anything that will actually cost me, like the Fusion Reactor, cos id lose Nuclear materials (on a budget!) if I remade the reactor. Break down all veggies, you get full parts back, break down anything you wont use, and prob best to break down decorations, all from within stored tab and done quite easily. 
---
P.s. also check your and tab. Things like inert flux can stack fast and weigh a pound each.
---
Well, I don't know *ahhhhhhhhh*
---
So, this is still happening. It's absolutely frustrating because all of the progress from the previous 5-10 minutes is moot as all and/or new enemies spawn. &gt;:-(
---
I think they’re just fucked til Bethesda fixes them. Shame too because I spent weeks trying to find the plans on Grahm. Only solution I’ve found is wiring a separate switch into the circuit and using it to open and close the door from inside my base. For now it’s more just for show than anything. Be nice once Beth fixes it, if they ever do.
---
So in reality, there were 10 redditors there in chameleon, crouched in the corners, watching for "normal" folks to show up. 
---
It depends on the bottom line, if current players stop playing after the 'end game' and the media negativity puts off new players is shan't last long.
---
Every online storefront/client should have 2FA as the first feature implemented. You are dealing with both people's money and privacy.
---
I'll knock it down to 500 caps. Nearly at the caps limit anyway.
---
the servers have never been better, at least on pc. there's no one playing.
---
makes me wish the game was offline even harder.
---
Yeah, definitely can't join unless they're on friends. I tried this a couple weeks ago.
---
Its gonna be all good man, add me on Xbox my gamer tag is singuei99. I swear that you will get better this year. 
---
its for the Prime receiver. Much like the crossbow only having the Prime receiver for itself.
---
I haven’t done a plasma but I did a furious Gatling laser and I saw a noticeable difference in scorchbeast fights. 
---
How xd But that seems a fine deal.
---
yeah that's the one I was going to do too. 
---
I’m so confused and entertained right now. 
---
It does way slightly less but it's very slight. I'm talking like .3 pounds or so. Not enough that you can rely on it as a weight reduction strategy, but technically yes it weighs less.
---
When you make bulk acid you are actually getting an extra 5 acid when you bulk it. So basically you can bulk it,
---
Scrap it, and bulk it for unlimited acid if you have plastic.
---
This&gt;&gt; 'obnoxious, visually overwhelming, ~~uninteresting~~, and cause lag/game crashes'
---
I just run at all costs if I see one so I can keep enjoying the rest of the game, scorch beasts are just a bug in the game that I do my best to avoid.
---
Try them all and form your own opinion?
---
How much flux per? 
---
joker if you on pc could you make me a set id give a nice tip
---
Same.
---
I found a plan today
---
Nukes are blocked for the new year
---
I run Jokers Bargains and i can attest to it fucking up the player market. What takes us days and weeks of grinding they can dupe in a few hours. They sell for dirt cheap or real money making the idea of what Todd Howard said pointless. We cannot be npcs for others like shop owners if this kind of thing is allowed to run rampant.
---
As is i don't know if the player market can even recover.
---
She's playing Tomb Raider that I bought her for Christmas. IDK what the new one is, but that one. 
---
Personal GOTY, yeah, mine too. Can't handle the press, but it definitely tickles a niche very well for a certain type of player.
---
Reasoning?
---
Bro I love it,  its like another world for me to live in. Lvl 120
---
I've found energy weapons (Laser/Plasma) break unreasonably quick no matter what you do. I built up my own Laser Rifle and it broke before I was even through the first clip; so I just scrapped it down and have stuck to ballistics.
---
As much as I would love to do a melee build (it speaks to my hoarder tendencies because ammo going down range is ammo I don't have anymore) - I am so over-encumbered even a level 1 Liberator would be able to fill me full of holes before I got in whackin' distance.
---
Why did he not take any damage from a fully charged gauss rifle (with all possible rifle perks active) with and without passive mode on? All he was wearing was excavator armor and I don't know of any Legendary power armor pieces. Is that a thing? Besides, I have demolition expert 5, and I can't destroy a full set of power armor instantly. I think I was level 78 in this video...
---
I approve. I'd really love the chance for some custom hooch recipes.

While we’re talking about chairs, can we actually lounge on the chaise?

I'll create a pure strength build called the Sorsby where I just strangle weak ghouls/cellmates
---
It's bizarre when people talk about high expectations from Bethesda released in terms of QA. They must have never played a Bethesda game at launch, except maybe FO4. Not excusing releasing buggy games, nor am I slagging off Bethesda. Just pointing out how weird people's expectations are by expecting them to suddenly release a bug free game out of the blue.
---
At least among the perks I have it looks like Batteries Included is the only specific energy weapon related perk.  Science! comes into play when modding as well, but I'm not sure if it has other uses
---
Thank you man i love this community alot
---
no not better spawn just giving people a chance to join it 
---
Thats not proof though. It could be bugged. I am seeing posts on LFG of people who are launching now.
---
Idk I saw a dude doing that earlier and after I showed up he followed me and we booty touched the mole miners inside. I think it’s because that event is hard to do solo so they wait for someone to help.
---
Events and forest zone workshops(so you don't use more than you earn on the defense events).

Thank you! ❤️❤️❤️

Different quest.

Just one if I recall

 I get it but still pvp is here and new, for whatever reason my post in the market has gained alot more traction, so please don't forget to share and atleast upvote.

That is terrible. 
---
Like silver said. With some practice you could make it a series of pictures. Get some players to dress in “normal” clothes and pretend it pre war life. Do captions. It’d be funny!
---
where!?
---
I understand , thank you.
---
Check Bethesdas twitter genius...
---
Wouldn’t it be nice if Bethesda actually finished their game before releasing it?
---
Thank you so so so much! Will take this to heart , and try to keep my head up i just am in a really low place much love dude!
---
so far the only things for sure that weigh less when bulked are aluminum and lead, unless anything changed
---
easy to find stimpacks: go thru every place where supermutans are.

Trust me when you farm days and weeks to supply your store so you can roleplay as a npc. Like todd Howard talked about and one of the reasons as to no npcs.
---
Only to have a duper fuck it by duping shit like 120,000 nuka colas ( 1 cap each) bypassing 25k cap limit. Able to buy everything in the game and sell it dirt cheap. Or dupe things like serums,mods ans TSE weapons making the real methods for them pointless.
---
Never alone getting into all the selling for real money...
---
But alas here we are and seven weeks with not a word or ban hammer from Bethesda...
---
I have one that gives you 5 loadouts for perk cards. It's an absolute must for anybody who doesn't do the exact same thing (i.e run around whitesprings) all day. Just one button and you can have all your crafting perks equipped, then once you're done press another and you can go off exploring again. 
---
I can't guarantee it's safe, but I waited a while after it came out before trying it and now I've been using it for weeks without any consequences.
---
Muh immersion.
---
my desktop PSU died, so I'm just chillin'  
---
being single is great, tho. You'll miss it when it's gone.
---
Yeah, it's been rough tonight. Been trying to play with two friends all night. took about ahour to get us all on the same server. Everytime we tried to join in on eachother server has been full. Then the one time we get on one it lags, then lags some more then crashes. Rinse and repeat. Also on PC so i don't know if H-t- is lucky or unlucky.
---
Thanks.. I didn't expect people to be that thoughtful!  I just did it again, and we had the 3 normal legendaries but perhaps only about 5 regular mole miners in total.  It's usually frantic, I've never seen it so quiet and boring.  Random is as random does?
---
My Xbox is Punidj , thank you 
---
Idk just they said to meet at the whitesprings bar and the nukes were blocked so everyone could go thats all I know 
---
White Knight makes repairs trivial
---
Take me home...
---
I rather do Uranium Fever with people. I'm a support character so it'd feel wasteful to solo it.
---
Oh that’s not too bad
---
Well done,  indeed. 
---
Okay and the last tweet says nothing about nukes disabled and the meet was set for 11:45est. That was 2 hours and 15 minutes ago genius. 
---
Thank you for posting this! Was gonna buy them!
---
At least it was dead, imagine your underwear if it wasn’t 
---
Of you paid a company to build a building and they made it at the quality level of Fo76 would the appropriate response be to justify it with the same logic?
---
Bridges are much longer and more complex than they were 100 years ago, yet they aren't falling down.
---
I managed to launch one at 12:05 EST. They shut down the bot that starts the launch prep, but I let him get killed and rebuilt him. As soon as I emptied my sack for toddies, they booted me from the server.
---
Nukes are disabled?
---
 U play Xbox?
---
It's blindingly obvious they have disblabled nukes to stop their fragile severs from crashing back to 2018
---
U play Xbox?
---
Nah pc
---
Update, things played out exactly like that.   Lol
---
Permaban the dirty cheaters, and the numbers might just go back up. It's more enjoyable when you don't have filith running around ruining the game.
---
for american servers
---
Same here . I came here hoping for info.
---
Seems like they are locked for all of new years day from what I've been reading 
---
Sigh... unzips.

Ah ok I got the same thing on xbox

I was going to give it to u if u played xbox

load into another server. Someone probably has a camp in the same location as you 
---
Wtf why 
---
Are you implying we shouldn't be making better games in 2018 than were coming out in 2013?
---
It's been 5 years, you can afford to upgrade your console/PC...

How do I do that with Xbox though?
---
My gf brought it up and i thought it was hilarious.

Wait... Whatt
---
New years celebration @ whitesprings
---
They said meet at the bar. Not a single word about nukes
---
Why and for how long? This explains why I cannot find any nuke zones lmfao.
---
Good for you man. Every time I see this it makes me sad. I just saved up to buy my first serum today and its a little depressing that there are so many people duping more of them than they will ever need even if they we just giving them away to every person they met during play.
---
First one sounds like cheating but you have no choice if you craft items that use acid it would break your bulk giving you more acid.
---
You cannot control that one and bulking is needed to control your stash.
---
The other one is a bug since launch and that just keeps piling up.
---
&gt; He's called Wendingus and looks like a mini megasloth.
---
Please implement u/LoneVaultWanderer 
---
Like i said that's all I know 
---
Reload the game.. Not sure how easy it is to server hop on console.
---
Mayor for a day safe runs.

So freak reduces the 55% chem to a lesser amount? Saweet.

Yup, same. I think servers are down right now :(

I'm glad my heartbreak saved you 360 atoms, fellow dweller :(
---
Another question is how do you get the never ending quest to go away, I've killed 3 Wendigos while wearing the stupid Clown Suit, 1st one didn't register at all, quest completed after the second, but no reward, since the quest was gone I dropped the Clown Suit, then later that day the quest came back again. I found another Clown Suit, and killed the Wendigo again, with the same result, quest complete, no reward, then comes back next time I log in.
---
Got armor penetration ripper drop, time to test it lol
---
I’ve logged in and out a few times but no dice.  It’s so frustrating. 
---
Pipe weapons are fine initially, particularly if you get Licensed Plumber in an early perk pack. Early on, just try all the weapons and see what you like. Build divergence doesn't kick in until later.
---
For heavy weapons a popular choice is a (non-energy) gatling for ammo conservation and a 50cal for raw dpm. Laser and plasma weapons are currently a bit rubbish and flamer fuel is too expensive. Harpoon gun might be good but I don't remember.
---
You don't get much mod choice with heavy weapons. The gatling has one upgrade for each part, except the front ring sight which is broken. The 50cal just has the heavy barrel.
---
yes i've literally had it only spawn the bosses before
---
I can help you, when do you want to do this? Right now? Or in the next few days? 
---
And in nightfalls it never ran out. 
---
Just keep me covered and i could burn any boss down.

G Sync doesnt work in borderless windowed mode as far as I have tried.
---
Ive tried every setting with COD, Destiny, OW, Battlefield. The G sync Icon will turn on fullscreen but never windowed.
---
To be honest, I cant even tell the difference. Since my system always keeps the refresh rates high anyway.
---
Also there is a certain build that focuses on low HP high rads .. don't be sucked into it .. year they may have 40 of each special but they still only have 40-50 health .. I'm a standard power armor tank build and they can't touch me .. 
---
melee stronk, melee cheap to repair, melee no need boolets

The game's balancing is whack, that's why "meta" stuff like super sledges and TSE guns are king.
---
That's not very Cash Money of you bruh
---
I want to do a power armor melee build but it seems very junk expensive. Also power armor comes late in the game.

I'd hope its a bug. Would be stupid on their part to disable them

I burned up all my diluted stimpaks, about 100 split between my group, the other day or so on a ScorchBeast Queen fight.  Using Super Duper and Chemist I crafted about 40 diluted after a few minutes of collecting tick blood from Point Pleasant, Moonshiner’s Shack, and Dolly Sods.

The world where people bitched constantly about paid dlc and still bitch about free DLC while ignoring that video games haven't increased in price for 20 years.
---
Healing salve is the way to go. Collect sootflower bloodleaf and boiled water. Combine at cook station. Does about the same amount of hp regen as a diluted stimpack but is way easier to craft. You lean the plan for it on the first responder quest you do.
---
😭
---
Another player built you stuff? That would come from their stash, not yours.  I believe that when you logged off their items don't transfer to you.  Therefore, logging in again should give you nothing since you built nothing beforehand. 
---
Maybe I'm wrong, but that's how I understand it to work. 
---
I did try this, but the results were poor at best and I started to feel like a rat pushing a level hoping for a reward.
---
Yes, especially with multiplayer games. People would act like these dlc for games was something that should have been in the base game even though the base game was full of content. I  used to visit the battlefield one subreddit regularly and it was a daily topic there.
---
How did it nuke go?
---
Now build your camp there and you'll have a dog!
---
I hope your joking.... a game using any song shoulf not change your experience of that song.
---
This seems like a troll....
---
Can't report a player because Bethesda doesn't have GMs who respond or monitor the game.
---
Discounted right now, might be 330 then. Only reason I bought them
---
Go away fed
---
Morgantown airport in the medical area I got about 50 regular stimpaks when combined with the chemist perk you get more than enough diluted stims. 
---
Again? How many times must the bot teach you this lesson!
---
Looks cool, what type of power armor do you use, and how do you handle all of the fusion cores?
---
I can’t tell if you’re joking lol
---
lol I like these.
---
I've wondered abut this -- several times I received legendaries from casual mobs.  I didn't complain, except that they were crap legendaries that were useless to my build, but even giving them away becomes a hassle, as I'm shambling around over-encumbered on double-secret-probation looking for someone with the right build to give them to, and it's time consuming, but I hate dropping legendaries on the ground in order to run away from a horde of chubbie glowing ghouls.
---
i drnank
---
i drnak
---
X01 with motion assist servos and calibrated shocks ... I rarely go through fusion cores .. if you log out in power armor when you come back the core is full ... I'm also highly mutated which probably helps alot 
---
i drank
---
lol get him im drnak
---
It would help if Bethesda actually owned their mistake. They've yet to admit that 76 was a monumental fuck up.
---
You Magnificent Bastard!
---
Legit explosives are just trash price now because people assume it's duped, so prices have plummeted for good legendaries. Trade is real shitty when everyone can just dupe what they want.
---
Buying a 10k duped gun just encourages people to exploit the game. If they are selling for real money, it's worse because they're scamming people who are clueless to how cheap these weapons really are.
---
Well worked for me while back lol. 
---
lol same

I love to build at places with radio too, it just makes the camp feels more lively. My current camp is on a hill overlooking the Mire, comes together with a trailer, a radio and a water source a short distance away (the water source's not within the camp radius sadly, but it's still fairly close, just follow the small hill behind the trailer to get to the small pond)
---
I recently stumbled upon another place that comes with radio too, but it has a hostile turret within the structure, not sure if it might despawn after you place down a camp there or not. 
---

---
dont you need to engage them for them to do any decent damage?
---
I haven't even done that.  As I said in my post, I've been encumbered since day 1 of beta, and I'm a bit of a carebear, so I like to give things away to people to help them out along the way.
---
I haven't completed the main questline yet because I only have 1 friend who plays the game.
---
im pretty sure its a bug cause the codes didnt reset ether
---
Most of the people I meet are great (or just look like they are AFK).
---
The problem is when I have seen people being douches they are doing it in a really big way and ruin your whole experience.
---
Then why not make it a safe zone, like Vault 76?
---
Wait what am I missing they can be friendly?
---
thanks
---
Not a rumor. Check fallout twitter. They disabled it so nobody would nuke Whitesprings for news years. 
---
Bethesda, save these poor people from themselves XD
---
How often do you have to repair your armor?

i peed and farded and shiddid

Dear God why 
---
Literally never ..
---
Nah, doesn't say that. Did they disable logging in too? Because I keep getting dc'ed and then stuck in the loading screen.
---
Servers are just fucked.
---
As I type this I see a message saying servers are going down for maintenance hahahaha
---
AFAIK you cant. Even the perk that removes rads during the day will wipe them out. Get starched asap.
---
Didn't answer my question, but made me laugh, though
---
I spent the last 2-3 hours traveling with a level 10, now level 13. Crafted him armor, a weapon  and did some missions. Good times.
---
Energy weapons are not their own thing ... You need either rifle or pistol perks to increase energy damage 
---
Why were you in a baby carriage op?
---
I’ve heard of Role playing but I don’t think fo76 is designed for that sort of role play 
---
Sounds pretty good. 
---
If the reason for the chem resistance for stimpaks and psycho?
---
Melee is the only one that has boost from special alone 
---
I thought she was coming out of the ash heap when she got attacked, oops.
---
And if she is responding to us nuking things she must still be alive?
---
I love this game, don't get me wing. But RDR2 is GOTY for sure, earned.
---
It’s a post apocolyptic wasteland.  I’m surprised there wasn’t a bloodbath on every server 
---
I know, but energy weapons as a whole are weak. Except ultracite but they are hard to get and require rare items to build/fix. 
---
There is many Chems that help and it's a case of the more the merrier .. and pshyco can be combined with mentats or buffout

Did the outside look like this? http://i.imgur.com/5My4YEe.png

Yea but things change and as you said at the moment it's explosive perks or melee

nope no sneaking

Could I switch out marathoner and dodgy or are they useful in the end?

Fuuuuusssiiiioooon haaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

Tin foil hat and prisoner collar.

It’s a mess

Apparently he is an idiot and didnt; realize that you can LOCK the terminal when you are in build mode. Just like the machinery and doors, the terminal has the ability to be locked which would put anyone attempting to hack it into Wanted status and the surrounding turrets would go apeshit on.   
---
Just a FYI.
---
Haha, exactly. Are they trying to say they designed their own modeling program with a custom 3D slicer just to print a simple bottle that can easily be designed in 2 hours with any readily available free-ware? The whole thing is just a joke. You take measurements, model, slice, and print. That's all there is to it. If at any point you've started writing code, you've made a serious wrong turn, lol.

The outfit is in the same place where you get the plan for T51 PA Nuka-Cola Paint, you can follow this [guide](http://dulfy.net/2018/11/21/fallout-76-nuka-cola-outfit-and-power-armor-paint-job-guide/) here on how to get it.

OH I didn't know there's BoS engineer outfit in 76! Where did you get it?

Got a really sweet Legendary weapon this evening, 3\* TSE The Dragon, with 250 damage resistance while reloading, then accidentally dropped it while trying to Equip it, and it disappeared  into oblivion with no warning.
---
100% up to you .. for the most part I don't need power armor so they help me a bit 
---
I always find it too easy. I have to be careful as I oneshot nearly everything including the legendary bosses. 
---
I’m a rifleman vats/Crit build with a Double Explosive Gauss rifle (Not that TSE duped crap).

If someone is in there with me I try just to do splash area damage to tag the mobs instead of one shotting them.

You're god damn right it is.

Anyone can see the Defend Event and select it to fast travel to the location from anywhere on the map. When you do this, you actually fast travel INSIDE the factory, as opposed to the normal fast travel when you come in on the road as the owner. So not only the exterior doors have the dealt with but there is a backroom that also has to be properly sealed. Personally i like to put emitters and flame throwers in there but that might a bit much. 
---
To much work
---
This 100%. 
---
Do the quest “Mayor for a day” in Watoga. Makes all the robots neutral to you and you get access to the Mayors safe which has 6-8 Stimpacks. You can endlessly Server hop collecting the stimpacks until you can’t carry any more. 
---
Had lots of SO's I prefer them as FWB, you can still do everything you would do with a SO ( cept kids, but having kids is crazy anyway lol) but you don't sign any contracts, don't have any real obligation to a FWB, and you'll have gobs of money and freedom. One of the best features of FWB is you'll always get the good sex, if they think you have other FWB and you should,they compete with one another, I am not getting married again till I am an old man.Not recommended for guys who have strong emotional feelings or possessive attachments to women, it takes a I don't give a fuck attitude to be truly free in the bachelor life.
---
Area based PvP is everything that’s wrong with PvP. Look at Diablo 2 and other successful games that had a bleak endgame; outside of starting a new character, PvP is what keeps the game fresh. It’s the only varying, unexpected thing in such a world; otherwise it’s the same boring dailies and the same monsters and the same grind over and over again. PvP is the lifeblood of online games, but it’ll forever be the ire of crybabies.
---
I seen a lvl 300 once.

So here’s what your gonna wanna do treat her out to a nice meal and then take her back to your hotel you can either go stiff or let it free like a hose 
---
What reference is this
---
No, I know not everyone is hacking, but the line is the difference between modding and aggressively modding. Hell I modded it, but that was because I wanted my damn steam overlay back lol. But does that mean I should be banned because I have a modded bit that launches fallout with overlay? How is that fair if anything I am damaging myself with distractions and an extra menu and things I have to close. Now things like radars for stealth and crouching I can see being banned but how are they gonna determine it?

NO CLUE. There is a porta-potty on Monongah lookout (I think north of this location) that has an elevator button in the back of it. I do believe flipping the switch that you posted does effect the elevator button in the potty, but it did not take me anywhere.

The guys never ended up getting back to me. So busy on that unfortunately

A ton of places in FO76 and FO4 have these creaking noises. The noises are mostly found near wrecks such as the crashed space station. In fallout 4, the shipwrecks and diamond city made this noise.
---
Happy New Year, everyone!

I skimmed through the video cause can’t really see it all rn but I will later for sure. What I got from skimming is that he’s complaining about loot boxes he never once mentioned games like fortnite, league of legends, other games that show you what costume you’re getting when you pay for it. My bad if he does talk about it though like I said I just skimmed. Coming from a person that has spent like 800 bucks on league of legends and a good amount on fortnite skins I buy cosmetics cause 1. I look cool af 2. It supports the developers of the game so I don’t see a problem with that what I have a problem with so micro transactions that give an upper hand which isn’t fair and basically forces you to buy them to have a equal playing ground. cosmetics are an option not a necessity so you saying “it’s people like you that will keep micro transactions going” is totally uncalled for.
---
Definitely very random. I've seen teslas and targeting HUD's while server hopping for (And still not finding) a jetpack and shocks for the X01..
---
Okay, but, if you want PVP, why couldn’t you just go to the raider areas? It’s not blocked off, and any level could access it as long as they made it to the PVP area. 
---
What platform do you play on? 
---
No, you’ll have them both 
---
Oh, how does that work 
---
PC Techkie
---
You starve 
---
Why no stealth? Too many friends? :P
---
Lever rifle + handmade is what I do. Works fine. I don't bother with melee, just run backwards and sideways when enemies get close, but then I'm mostly non-PA so a bit squishy.
---
Build is pretty simple. Tank Killer, Bloody Mess, Glow Sight in dangerous places, and as many rifle damage perks as I can jam in. One point each in Adrenaline and Tenderizer, then a lot of quality-of-life stuff. When in PA I equip Dodgy. I don't use VATS much so it's freebie tanking.
---
What legendaries are you running?
---
Fallout 76 actually needs stuff like this.
---
If you're not familiar with the Rule of Thirds, you should look it up.

I’m unsure of where I received the second chassis but I can’t get rid of it and it is taking up space in my Stash. The screencap is taken inside my armor chassis I previously owned.
---
Personally after playing eso gw2 and old games like runescape and others...id rather pay for the cosmetics..simply comes down to i would rather spend my money on what i like over to keep playing a game..sometimes i have extra and sometimes i dont...really comes down to having a choice to spend or not...

Neat I’ve always wanted to try that

Except for the massive cost in resources for no benefit whatsoever

The burning sensation stops after a few days, when it shrivels up and falls off.

it does not say nukes are disabled stop spreading bullshit, nothing in that post says they are disabled.... it is more then likely a bug since hte old codes are gone from my misc, but when i went and got the new ones they where the same as last week.......

I don't understand how it works.

You can still eat preserved foods and canned goods, definitely a challenge but not impossible

Again- by removing PvP from the general world and thus removing it as a potential hazard when not specifically looking for PvP, you ruin the spontaneity and variability of the world. It becomes a mundane, predictable grind with no real endgame reward. Take a look at what happened to Ultima Online- the minute they catered to the crybabies and removed their ingenious criminal justice system in favor of a basic, optional PvP zone, they killed their own magic, uniqueness, and placed the first nail into the game’s coffin.
---
Remember what?
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but how does
---
&gt; Let's all gather around the White Springs bar tonight at 11:45EST and get some New Years Eve photos together! See you there!
---
imply in any way that they are disabling nukes? Did they specify this somewhere else on Twitter? I couldn't find anything.
---
Better Than Life™... don't do it kids.
---
Good idea
---
Thanks for the advice! That Gatling does AoE, has 90% reduced weight AND does 10% more damage if you're mutated.
---
So three stars means three effects?
---
not sure how long. i'm trying to get on an AUS server lol
---
Well, I think the wiki implies that she got angry about the nukes, then went to mountaintop and got ganked by mole miners. Probably will be more clear in the DLC.
---
Pvp is a useless part of this game
---
I'm on Xbox, in White Springs, all alone :(
---
I ran with a gatling plasma for a while but it breaks too often of doesn't feel very powerful. I am not sure about the cores as I always had a bunch if them, not even sure where I picked them up from.
---
I had a bunch if cores I am looking to get rid of if you want them though (PC).
---
I generally stick to myself, so the half dozen times I've encountered other players (I'm lvl 61 now) it's been mostly negative. But the few times it has been positive, it's been hours and hours of positive followed by friending each other and playing again on another occasions. So it makes up for the bad. 
---
My SO is my waifu pillow.. It finally started standing up on its own after I _used_ it for awhile ;)

Can scorched be friendly??
---
I was responding to the comment from root\_0f\_all\_cause.

Forced pvp in games where its shit and doesnt belong is just shit. And youre obviously too stupid to know this so its safe to assume youre shit too.

If this were UO youd be a trammie bitch talking about how hard you are when you roll into fel with 40 guild members.

Lucky #@$%!#$^ my typical legendary drop is one-star special underwear that reduces damage by 3% from ghouls named Christie only between 4pm and 4:03

They are using item copy bug 
---
I stole everything from cheaters
---
They had Superslage (blooded, attack speed, power+1) and a lot of plans (serums)
---
no there was a radio in the beta i assume they took it out cause of bugs
---
I don’t know, man. My ones are always naked :/ 
---
Okay, but was Ultima’s pvp good? (Actually asking, don’t know anything about Ultima) Assuming it was- I can see how that would be  annoying and ruin the game. But, fallout wasn’t designed for it. If they balanced it and built the game to actually accommodate PvP, I would be all for it. I do not consider getting one shotted and ganked by high level jerks killing me and taking my junk “spontaneity and variability”. 
---
I would argue that you could EASILY add more spontaneity and variability by encouraging players to cooperate and communicate to achieve a task or trade. That is one of favorite parts about the game. The ability to Interact with other players, such as giving low levels supplies or trading funny stories, is in my opinion on of the things this game did SO right.
---
I'm a sneak sniper build at level 40, started at lvl 17-20 range so I'll have to change some specials but something in my build is broken currently as far as the sneak aspect is concerned.
---
Everything I come across stays in [     CAUTION      ] after I initiate a fight in solo and they HAVE TO walk into me before they see me. So sneak sniper is viable :)
---
I don't think ther are enough perk points to run both Power Armor and stealth, and I prefer PA.  I used to have All Rise but then it broke and I forgot to repair it, so I accidentally scrapped it.  So now I'm using an AutoStim, +1 int left arm, and Last Bastion (+5% acc with guns).  
---
I'm not the worlds more accurate person with guns, so Iike the melee because can swing and miss and not waste any ammo :)
---
I use VATS pretty frequently.. when clearing out beginning areas Iike to just hit 'q' and shoot about 5 or 6 times and not have to worry about the whole aiming thing ;)  It is also nice to get controlled crits as well.
---
I'm heading to bed at the moment, but tomorrow I'll post the full build with SPECIAL and perks.
---
It’s the Y2K bug. 
---
&gt;So three stars means three effects?
---
Yup. You never know what those 2 extras starts are going to be until you look. 
---
Pizza and wine. Keeping it classy 
---
do they get mad?
---
&gt;  when you decided I would say something in reply and then call me wrong for something you decided I would say lol.
---
I didn't decide you'd say anything, I quoted what you said. I didn't call you wrong, I called you an asshole for being negative to others for having a different agenda. You don't get to be a snide asshole and then pretend to be the white knight of the thread, you're just an asshole. None of that is irony, its you being negative towards a different view point then following that up with being stupid about it.
---
Servers are just fucked at the moment.
---
Blind fanboys are claiming Bethesda has stated they are preventing all nukes. But nowhere does it say that.

Probably energy explosive. Apparently dense or padded non-PA chest pieces work well against it.

I honestly can't tell if this is the cutest or stupidest thing ever. I'm almost sorry I was out having a life cos it would been fun to go.

I can't speak for FF14, but the WoW shop was minimal (Legion last time I played) with a few mounts and a couple of pets. Having a cash shop isn't Satan in action. Having to rely on the income from the cash shop in order to provide adequate customer support and any meaningful game service isn't the best. Pay2Play cash shops are for the most part quite different from F2P/Buy2Play cash shops in terms of what they sell. Loot boxes (gambling), trade:able skins/mounts (in order to convert real currency to in-game currency to compete with the third party sites), and my favorite. Quality of Life buffs, Like Bless Online, you had to buy mount stamin in order to ride fast. Otherwise it took a year and a half to regenerate it. The same was true in Tree of Savior. Just shitty features that everyone has come to expect of a game in todays market, but they strip those features away and then resell them to the users because most people will go mad without them. It's just a cheap trick to milk money out of people.
---
I can't log in at all. 
---
It says Authentication Failed. 
---
I'm on console, so it's definitely a server issue. 
---
it was epic fail for them
---
I think its a paint job. Because I got a [gilded minigun](https://imgur.com/4b0er8i) as a drop a few days ago.
---
I recognize this for what it is, but it is possible others will not. Maybe add: _Just kidding_ at the bottom. 
---
10/10 would LOL again in public. 
---
You're lucky you discovered that on T-60 shocks rather than X-01s.
---
As a workaround, don't bulk steel unless you're about to sell it. It doesn't save weight anyway.
---
Yep this is what I want Bethesda to focus on. Hopefully they'll add Hello Kitty skins to the shop as well and maybe a Macho Man voice over for Ghouls pack. BONG!
---
Consider that 99.3% of players will completely ignore you or simply wave and carry on, the game is already pretty mundane and predictable. Removing pvp would change almost nothing. I see one wanted person every eighth or ninth server I am on. There is absolutely no need to remove it, because it's basically non existent.
---
But is iT Fun thou? I Love my revolver with gun fu shooting around. Also tse is kinda a bit meh it’s too op imo.
---
That article especially is a trip. I commend you for actually reading that drivel as it was quite lengthy for what it sought to accomplish, which was to say "this game sucks". 
---
I mainly want to know what the problem is. Why are people so stuck on hating 76? It really doesn't make any sense to me. I see the valid criticism and the ways the game needs to be improved, but writing an article like this truly is bizarre. They assume much and make judgements based upon those assumptions. Really seems like they set out first to bash the game and everything else came second. I think the term is "motivated reasoning". 
---
My friends and I pushed hard this week to get everyone ready to launch a new years nuke... And then we couldn't

I often clear lowbies of their wanted status. I then wait by their bags and sometimes give them a plan/weapon/ammo to get them on their way to become stronger. Some day I hope to get ganked by one of the lowbies I met.

Not great. Disappointed to say the least. Has some coconut flavoring. Pretty shitty rum imo.
---
The whole experience reeks of OMG it linked, and I logged in, let's ship!
---
Not that I've ever done something like that myself.  Sometimes when standing on a mountain of dependencies written by other people, and no clear understanding of any of it, you are just asking for issues and fixes that break 20 other things.
---
Sometimes NIH is a good thing
---
Clearly we're all paid shills.
---
nah, the rum's always gone ^((in this case it may be my fault)^)
---
SB are above my camp so often when I login that it forces me to regularly server hop just to be able to progress with my current quest or camp activities, not near any fissures, at least the C.A.M.P unit allows easy repair of the whole shebang, that's nice.
---
Prob dropped on fram by another player
---
That's awesome!
---
You make friends with the Wendigo(crack jokes,have small talk)
---
Once you gain its trust, take it to the cuircus( its true home)
---
He will soon find the costume and be one with the clown
---
Thanks for the tip but I use my steel for bullets. (I'm a heavy guns build.) 
---
The date is stuck on reclamation day, so I'm not too surprised that they didn't think about tracking time.
---
Ive yet to hear anything abou a key location
---
The fix: you'll want to drop your ammo for it then pick it back up and I believe you have the gun in your hand when you do.
---
Possibly but usually when you modify a PA frame that doesn't belong to anyone it gets bound to you. Also the condition of the pieces were pretty bad. 
---
That’s a good point, and I like the oddly specific statistic lol. However, what say you to people overtaking workshops and people who broke your C.A.M.P.? PvP is engaged with workshops and heavily provoked with breaking property. 
---
I feel like you should propose subcontracting their server costs since you are apparently a magical server elf of some sort.
---
Let us all know how that turns out.
---
Bravo! Nice work! 
---
How certain are you the seed is tied to the name explicitly?
---
I'd imagine special stats might play a role in determining the seeds. Have you tested identical builds?
---
Does this have anything to do with the countless empty safes my girlfriend finds while I always find loot?
---
Does the better odds name contain a space? I bet not. I suspect spaces in name fuck the rng bad if it is indeed tied to to a seed.
---
Have you shared this with those who dig through the esm? I believe all item generation is client side but the server sends the creation packet. More information would be available on this if people find charname in the esm. 
---
I actually made two friends in this game.
---
Helped one guy take down a deathclaw, and the other I have some stuff too.
---
Haven't actually had anyone try to kill me yet.
---
they didn't want people nuking whitesprings they posted on their twitter about meeting at the bar in the hotel, it's just for tonight i assume
---
Beware. It's not consistent, but just picking up junk can get you flagged. It's less too plenty of frustration in areas like Wade Airport, which have not workshop areas. 
---
Oh thank god, dude. I got a little drunk and went for a spin in the ol' PA and I figured it just got impounded, but fuck.... WHOOOOOoooo what a relief, man.
---
This isnt really proof
---
Im actually going to reply with "so im suppose to leave whenever someone shows up to grief me?" Because that's what you are saying. That gives the power to the assholes. All that has to be put in to place is a mechanic where if you fail to take a workshop, you can't try again for a certain amount of time. That would have solved this whole issue instead of letting this guy harass me for an hour straight while I'm just tryna play the game how the game is intended. I mean literally it says "claim the workshop" whenever your near one so yes, i do believe workshops are an integral part of the game and shouldn't be abused for the pvp mechanic.
---
Probably not mad at all, once the stuff is put in a container the duping is done. They still keep their items, just not the extras. They just server hopped and carried on most likely.
---
This post is all over the place, please clarify 
---
As a PvPer across many games, this has not been my experience at all. When you've played enough games that have unrestricted PvP, constant risk of dying and losing everything you have is just something you get used to.
---
Ah I don't use Twitter.  If that's the case what about the fissure sites pretty sure they always open and you could fall in them right?
---
I disagree. You can go popup blind.
---
If you are a pacifist...
---
...the dialog should read "This Action is Impossible for a Pacifist" and it should be Impossible to perform the action without changing your settings.
---
... Claiming unclaimed workshops should be free or discounted.
---
... Adverse claim of a claimed workshop would be Impossible.
---
... A non-pacifist should incur agro from your workshop defenses normally since that's how _they_ chose to play.
---
I'll give it a look, thanks for the info.
---
Nah
---
What why? If this is a joke not funny
---
Can't launch nukes .(didn't know about the Twitter post) and fissure sites are closed up I remember falling in them  and you can't now .
---
I already made friends with the deathclaw, now I get to make friends with a wendigo? This is the best!
---
It just irks me that I have to micromanage my perks depending on what I'm doing at that exact second. Sure I have a general dogsbody build but now I want to make armour. Switch switch switch. Now I want to do combat with a gattling, switch switch switch, now I want to wear non power armour, switch switch switch.
---
Note none of this is preventing me doing what I want, it is only making me micromanage it. Yay such funs.
---
In FO4, NV, 4 there was a trade off. Sure you Can get Nerd Rage but then you can't select Lead Belly (exame not canon )., in this it is just you can't have more than X combination of cards. 
---
Clearly no idea that the graphical data still causes a load on the server, regardless of whether the world itself is loaded across the server or not. And given that each individual pixel itself requires the server to upload/download that data from each and every computer loading the queen means that a flesh pile, which is much smaller and therefore takes less data, is easier to load across all screens.
---
And any idiot can get CCNA certification. Hell, just claiming that you have a CCNA doesn't mean anything. CCNA has courses for TURNING ON A COMPUTER for God's sakes. And in all honesty, listing out every single certification they have for IT, and need for every single job given how often the industry changes and how often you need to be recertified given industry standards, who the hellwould sit there and list them all rather than just saying that they are a professional &gt;.&gt;
---
Clearly someone who used Google to try and show someone up and failed. 
---
How did you guys end up floating in #14?
---
Did I hit a nerve, lil guy? If it were UO I wouldn’t be playing after the introduction of trammel and felucca- I’d have quit like everyone else when PvP became option, felucca was created for it, and carebears like you came out from under your rocks because you were too afraid to leave a guard zone in the original game.
---
Additionally, what sort of games does “forced PvP” belong if not in open world rpg’s? Do you mean to say that only competitive games- the rts games, pubg’s, and overwatches of the world qualify as being valid for PvP?
---
If anything this game has too restricted of PvP considering the method of initialization.
---
Now get back to crying into your pillow about my mean opinions, you millennial fruitcake 😂.
---
Hang on, didn't you just post something about being a *cannibal*?

Damn thanks for the info though

yes sir! i am online now... TheSpielor ingame!

Yeah. I think the iffy reviews scare off the punks. All the griefers are on RDR2 and FO76's population is simply wonderful.

Man I JUST posted that subreddit on another image.  It's my new favorite thing, honored to  contribute. 
---
Good God no.
---
Stuff is mostly meh now. With some exceptions, but with how steep the prices are for some of the items (limited time ones especially) I could see happenin by that the odds of getting something deemed "good" as being lower than something meh or average. I mean skewed to make sure that those items are less likely to appear than they should if they had unaltered chances.
---
I'm  not saying Bethesda *would*, just that with how triple a games have been recently with loot boxes and microtransactions, I could see it happening.
---
\^\^ This \^\^
---
Yes- if anything PvP is too restrictive. It needs to be balanced to avoid instant kills and reworked with a better system. Easier to initialize; guard zones; a criminal justice system beyond a simple wanted status etc
---
Good advice! So, if I have one (or two) of these giant, utterly unplaceable stored bases...is there any way I can delete it without having to place it? Or is it just eternally taking up 50% of my stored tab?

just lost my god rod super sledge from trade glitch and I wont be playing again

The patch to 'fix' the exploit to dupe was basically just to deny the ability to rejoin a server via recent players (so cheaters couldn't dupe items solo). It seems like it was simply a temporary fix. 
---
People are still duping with second accounts/computers or with friends. If you see people just hanging around a paper bag or container for 30+ minutes and the server starts doing the 'server is not responding' crap, you know they're duping. It's more obvious when the characters are named similarly--I literally see small groups of players with just random number generated names in towns or &lt;PlayerName&gt;001 and &lt;PlayerName&gt;002, etc. People are doing this because they are trading items for real money (eBay has a bunch of weapon/armor listings for each platform)
---
So essentially, there was no true duping exploit fix. Just this change that made it so you couldn't rejoin on a random player that isn't friended. This is also partially why servers are still very unstable: duping requires server instability or something like that to delay the server-side character saves.
---
&gt;so im suppose to leave whenever someone shows up to grief me?
---
yes. there are assholes everywhere and, contrary to popular belief, you gain nothing by standing up to them. except a negative caps count. whenever you take a workshop you're putting a huge red neon sign on your back that says "kill me"
---
it's also hardly integral as you can gather junk more efficiently. the way I see it, workshops are Bethesda's way of incentivizing pvp. they're like arenas, and the winner gets some free stuff.
---
what they should rework is camp interaction. as it is, it's too easy for griefers to destroy your shit. but workshops? don't see a problem with them, at all.
---
Your budget goes up as you level but from what I've read you will need to completely rebuild and/or move your CAMP for the budget to rise.

TELL ME LIES TELL ME SWEET LITTLE LIES\~

Ultima’s original incarnation went for “reality.” Guards in cities that an individual could call if stolen from or attacked; laws that guards inforced such as not looting innocent corpses; players who committed crimes had their name turn from blue to grey for 2 minutes provided they were caught (such as stealing) and of outside of a guard zone they could be attacked by anyone for this. A player who killed more than 5 innocents would inherit a red name and be considered a murderer- guards would kill him on sight. It would take more than a death to remove it; he would have to wait many hours logged in online for a murder to “roll off” and him to become innocent again. As a murderer, like as a criminal, anyone could attack or loot him freely. High penalties for murder; realistic gameplay. No “magical force field” preventing players from attacking players etc- just a warning box (in later days before the game was ruined) that made a player confirm whether they’re meaning to perform whatever criminal act they’re about to perform (could be toggled off) to prevent accidental flagging.
---
Looks cool. Is the Raider thing with the bodies part of the environment?
---
Marsupial Mutation, we're just standing on the sign there. Was a ridiculous shot, why not haha
---
Pretty much all my character eats so alright. 
---

---
By and large, the worst I've seen is people not being considerate about drops... Or heaven forbid, not returning a wave. 
---
That's a tiny tiny minority. I've given and gotten a lot of gifts and waves. This is a game where the PC population often *fucking queues up* for occupied vendors. 
---
Win or fail a SBQ, I've always found a surprising amount of solidarity and camaraderie. 
---
Yeah... this effectively does nothing to the dupers. It lets people feel self righteous though!
---
There used to be, but then they got removed, I guess it was some sort of bug.
---
ive been playing the whole time with no message, on console btw
---
Honestly, I just want my CAMP to be indestructible (by players) when I'm Pacifist.
---
I've come back to my camp multiple times with everything destroyed, and some high level asshole trotting off to grief someone else. Then I have to spend all my resources to rebuild.
---
If you lost your hammer, what was used to hammer this nail in the coffin you speak of?
---
People building stuff in your camp gives you the object. Or at least it did at launch. 
---
If anyone has the bomber jacket they could part with please let me know
---
Okay this sounds awesome and it’s a shame that they got rid of such a dynamic and deep PvP system. However, I can’t say that fallout has that. If they did, that would be cool! I guess I should say that I would rather see FO76 PvP improved before getting rid of it completely. But they would likely have to do such an overhaul that it wouldn’t be worth it. 
---
I found that dog too! Made me kind of sad to think he's stuck up there. I was going to build a camp there so he could kind of be my pet, but it's not really close to where I travel most. 
---
Imagine being this gay
---
My forehead
---
I had Grafton in addition to the Munitions Factory, so it was ok. IMO thats part of what FO 76 is all about. 
---
Changing engines is usually intensely complex and takes a few games to really get the handle of.
---
 I can only imagine how bad Bethesda would be if they were also learning a brand-new engine.
---
oh explosives expert helps those guns  ? fuck yeah time to get that perk. does the damage stat on one of those weapons include the explosive damage 
---
Oh look, it's this thread again. 
---
There is also the 300% HP regeneration mutation but that kills the effect of stimpaks at default levels if they don't have the two perks mentioned above to help plus the perk that helps with the negative effects of mutations.
---
They probably want plans, 30 caps is cheap to pick up plans you might not have.
---
I physically recoiled 
---
Mods will be scrapped if you need the materials they provide to build/repair
---
nope. that "exploit" isn't real. you messed something up on your end.
---
if you can provide any sort of undeniable evidence that the exploit exists, i'll paypal you $10.
---
Oh that's nice for you on console.
---
When crafting if you do not have the base ingredient it will scrap mods before bulk versions of those ingredients.  Happens for any sort of crafting.  Usually happened to me after bulking a ton of items.  Took me reading a reddit post to realise what was happening.
---
why do you need strength points for an explosive weapon
---
"Won't someone take pity on me and give me one for free?"
---
Caps are easy to get. It's not a waste. When I started playing I stumbled on the dirt track junk yard. I saw the quest pop up clear the enemies. I encountered my first bug unfortunately, one of the mobs was under ground, so I didn't get to take it. I went back there next time I played and took it and didn't know what to do hehe. So I start looking up what to do at workshop etc. Now workshops are my favorite part of the game. 
---
Its not that difficult to fortify it enough to force lockpicks or destruction of ice machines, nuka cola machines, fences and file cabinets. 
---
i get marsupial and jump in the air and shoot them 
---
Mods can be used as junk. If you are bulking or crafting it will disappear and be used for whatever material it is. It is quite frustrating.
---
the game automatically scraps them when you need the materials to craft something.
---
Yeah, all of that was just hi. How are you, oh whats that you are doing over at my workshop?Oh.. i'm dead and you are destroying everything. I need to stop begin such an a hole huh
---
Let's be real here. PvP won't be removed. It's part of the core of the game. PvP takes the place of human npcs including their hostility
---
XP my dude. Especially for low levels. (I'm a 61) 
---
This is poor advice.
---
I agree. Fallout has an awkward engagement system; most engagement is accidental, and the penalty towards murderers is nonexistent. I always prefer realistic, engaging PvP to having none at all.
---
Yes, I got to keep the containers and decorations from the raider camp.  I put stuff in the containers for passersby while I'm raiding nearby encampments.  When I came back today my bedroom door was open and there was a decent gun in one of them, I think it was a thankyou.
---
if you want to pay money for caps, you can already do that.
---
♫ Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream! ♫
---
Yes - if the piece is standalone it wi be called sentinel. If not it will be whatever the first legendary ability is (if more then 1 star legendary). 
---
The stat itself gives -15% damage when standing still. Get 5 x pieces + some helpful perks and well... the math speaks for itself.
---
I'm talking about refreshing their inventory for like some stupid low amount of atoms.
---
There is also the breaking bad teddy bears (I posted before)
---

Ffs...did you contact Bethesda? Opened a tocket?
---
&gt; initiate conversation
---
Now you’re just talking weird and stuff. Initiate conversation?
---
Since when can you do that in Fallout 76?
---
Just near some traincars though? Kinda odd but okay
---
Funny that gets down voted. I'm not accusing just suggesting. If you're getting griefed much more than the general population you have to examine why. It's either your personality or your base location. I'm sure you greatly increase your chances of being griefed if you make bases in high population areas (like outside whitesprings anywhere).
---
I don’t exactly want it to be removed (despite my title, I know lol) because of us acting as npc’s, but it’s done so poorly. When someone attacks me, it doesn’t feel like a raider wants my caps or chems or to just kill me. It feels like some level 100+ level jerk is bored because he’s explored and experienced everyone other part of the game and is killing for fun. (Maybe that’s what a raider is going to feel like no matter how they do PvP?)
---
Mods are like bulked junk. They get scraped if you need the materials to craft something. This obviously unnintended feature is present from release, they haven't fixed it yet.
---
If you want to farm for specific plans you can already just relog, but that's also shit-tier gamer behavior.
---
And the way you're passive aggressively defensive over a very passively stated question adds to the theory. 
---
Yea because I record all my games .. it's a thing whether you like to admit it or not .. I had my weapon, I traded l, no longer have it ... 
---
Sometimes creatures can have explosives in them.
---
If your perception is high enough, a dialogue box will pop up to warn you. Its only happened to me once before
---
I have, might need to relog/store? I have problems kepping them on, do they even do any good lol
---
There aren't any XP glitches left except for duping items and crafting something for measly XP. Set up a macro and a duper has a solution to level a mule character who they need to hold more stuff. Take them to level 15 and they'll have max strength. Maybe add some other weight reducing perks (travelling pharmacy for example) and you can make them hold a lot of serums.
---
Looks very nice. With the rarity of it it would be good if you could somehow extract it for use on a higher level legendary version.
---
I was just thinking more of this and ya they really dropped the ball on the side quests. They should have just made one side quest lead to another and this would have been avoided. Thinking of other games like Witcher 3 the side quests were great, all lead into other side quests and by the time I finished all the side quests I was perfectly leveled for the main quest line. Sigh.
---
Or you could use it as a way to keep your health low for a min-max build
---
Is this a Red Dwarf reference in a fallout sub?
---
Please stop pretending that this game followed anything like a normal price trajectory. It’s consistently half price a month and a half after release. I’m 100% sure if I go graph out comparable AAA studio releases they won’t look nearly the same.
---
I paid $60 because I trusted BSG to release a game that was in a stable, finished state with maybe a few buggy quests or graphics bugs.
---
Instead we got a game in Alpha state. And the price reflects it.
---
Nah man, I'm sober and I find it funny, too.
---
this is WV we drink shine 'round here 
---
u/jestersaegis7 
---
There's no cap on how much you can carry so there's no point to get weight perks for their mules.
---
no. it was 100% an error on your end. sorry.

Is the trade hack real? Someone else posted about it 2 weeks ago and i haven't traded anyone since. When someone offers me trade i run like hell in the other direction. Can the OP be right? I really won't trade anyone until the full community can confirm that this was never a real glitch that people can exploit.
---
Mine is at work 
---
Don't do anything you'll regret. After all hindsight's 2020. 
---
I wanted to do it, but there was only somebody farming the restaurant as usual.  Bethesda should have programmed the robot to hand out some goodies to get some celebration going.  Oh well.
---
People wouldn't need to server hop if the game was worth a damn right now
---
The prices are high, but it also is just another way to play the game. If there's something that's rare that you don't care for but know how to get easily, you can start accumulating it so you can get things you want. Also, even though most general stuff can be bought with caps, most of the really good items people want they only trade for because the cap limit for any character is 25k. 
---
Further, you can get 1400 caps every day on vendors alone. Caps really aren't an issue. Finding stuff people are willing to trade for is an issue. I could have upwards to 50k value of goods on my character but the guy who has the armor piece I want only wants random Delbert Recipes that I don't know how to find.
---
Was this at the Red Rocket in the ash heap? I did the exact same thing earlier today and got the pie on my third try!
---
Downvoting reporting in
---
I messed around with this glitch for a while creating a variety of different camp themes. Raider/Junker/BoS/Military/Etc. Along with just having random plans for creating insurmountable defensive death towers. Had one tower with over 30+ Missile,Heavy Laser, and Heavy Machine Gun Turrets and just let it have fun killing scorchbeasts for an hour before dismantling it. If you know what you’re doing with electricity, you run lighting with just a single small generator. The only one I really needed to go over budget with the glitch was for the military compound. Making a circular defensive perimeter with high wall guard posts at up budget.
---
Yes, its deletable on the stored tab by simply hitting X on your controller, or whatever key of you are mouse/keyboard to scrap stuff. I was hesitant to delete it there when I first became aware of it, but deleting it doesnt make you lose any of the items in it, it simply breaks it down to 'floors x16' or 'Mk1 Turret' from the big ugly blueprint icon. Risk free.
---
k, nobody will miss you if you quit playing
---
Hey, do you have any of these left?
---
bro thank you so much. :) where are you? DEAD???
---
Corrected!
---
Seems its possible to find all perks by raising levels. Thanks! 
---
i wish they fix this glitch they fixed the one that spawns u above your camp or off a cliff but this one stays
---
Most services these days use TOTP. There's not much need to reinvent the wheel at the core; services distinguish themselves on how they dispense secure codes (through a website, a mobile app, using a hardware display or dongle, text, etc). 
---
The thing about 2FA is the system doesn't even need to be unique or clever. The solution space blows up so quickly from even a short code that it makes brute force unviable. 
---
Not that there aren't ways around it. But systems that had 2FA before rarely seem to retreat. 
---
This post just made my hole weak!!
---
It might be real or it might not, its something thats hard to prove as you'd need to be randomly recording to catch it or have the set-up and wherewithal to begin recording before every trade.
---
I don't have multiple doors and my CAMP still dupes itself. I thought it was supposed to be fixed in the last patch, but it happens often enough that I have a macro that scraps stored items in multiples of 10. The biggest pain is when it used to happen to crops and I would have over 400 corn stored.
---
You will see, you will learn...
---
Your not wrong but I got one good way to fix give us private severs/solo games to avoid that shit
---
I can 100% assure you it's real .. I was jubvious as well but it is .. people are saying I just dropped it ... But seriously why the fuck would I throw away something like what I had 
---
You can pacify them with wasteland whisperer for some casual, spicy chit chat
---
You have to take it out to dinner first. 
---
Because it hasn't happened to you it's a hoax ? Ok keep believing that and trade freely with everyone then 
---
Very cool! I climbed up to the top scoop on the excavator and took a bunch of pics (20 pics to complete the photo op challenge) 
---
thx bro!
---
Back to Fort Defiance. 4th floor. 
---
I had the same thing happen. I had a god roll TSE handmade, lever action, gauss rifle, full combat BoS weightless with great 2nd and 3rd mods on it and lost it all. Man, it sucks because thats totally real and happened. Boy, Im most likely never going to play again ever. I mean... I might..if someone were to give me all that.. stuff.. i already totally had.
---
wow. nice
---
You can have your mods back. 
---
Seriously don't even care I'm just telling people to beware of random trades .. 
---
I lvled a alt by claiming as many workshops as possible and what happens is when I'm done defending one I have to go defend another. I get to free fast travel get easy quick xp and loads of plans . Made more caps than what I spent claiming all the workshops so nah it's pretty good imo. You also get caps when clearing a workshop before claiming it. Around lvl 30 I was getting 20 caps to clear them and it cost 25 to to claim so really it pays for its self definitely after killing and looting like 2 mobs .
---
If you pvp in a game that has pvp, you're a bad person, an idiot. Why can't you understand that? :D
---
I can't believe that's how some people think.
---
That’s what we did.
---
Good game.  Trilogy Reminds me of Dark Souls in that the first one was fantastic with a few hitches, part 2 was kinda lackluster with story but the mechanics were upgraded and the 3rd one sits snuggled between them. 
---
Looking good, sir!
---
She mutated and got the teleporting mole rat mutation.
---
Okay, good night. 
---
so you gotta leave???
---
You do realize private servers wont resolve anything. I think most people think mods will just magically work in a private server situation, but fail to realize, that your mods need to be hosted on the server, and so therefore will need to go thru approvals from Bethesda (ala creation club style), because anyone can make a mod to unlock all Atom Store items easily, obviously they can't allow that.
---
Oh yeah no I mean, I totally dont care either. Thats exactly why I totally wont be playing anymore, unless people wanna chip in to replace in. I wont be playing because I dont care. My story is also true, just like yours. We both dont care though, about our true stories, which is why neither of us will be playing anymore, because even though losing that doesnt matter, screw this game, you know.
---
good night my friend. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. Hope to see ya soon!!!
---
When you drop a frame it's in a paper bag.
---
speed demon
---
&gt; Is the trade hack real? 
---
Nope. It's when people just request whatever item during trade for 1 cap. People who claim this trade "hack/exploit" exists are the ones who accepted the trade blindly and refuse to admit it.  
---
With how common replay capture features are on PC and consoles, why haven't we seen any footage of this exploit?   
---
For further reading/details, [check out edit 4 of this post from 2 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a7e7pa/tradesteal_exploit_publicity/).
---
No?
---
Still won't save you if you hit something bipedal on the head! 
---
Agree with everything that you said. PvP is the only fresh factor this game can have. The story in this game is not very engaging and the grinding can become mondaine and boring. The hazard and interaction of players wanting PvP is the only excited thing can happen outside of your daily routine. If anything else i wish they turned the NOB on pvp, something like double the damage if is now on non-flagged hits. Also rework pacifist mode. Enable pacifist by default and make people hold Ctrl to flag the first hit then attack normally. That will ensure no accidental hits.
---
Mu guess is someone foudn one in the wild and modified it for someone to find. 
---
I think mtx can have a place. Esp in games where there are server costs. I’m honestly less concerned about the studios than I am the fans who don’t seem to get: the more you give the more they will take because they are for profit corporations who at the end of the day care about profit maximization.
---
The position of a “rational consumer” is I WANT to pay as little as possible for as much as possible and the position of a “rational producer” to be I want to charge as much as possible for as little as possible.
---
This tends to result in a place in the middle where both sides do well, but when you have a whole cadre of consumers who aren’t being “rational consumers” and are not only happy to pay more for less, but act as if you’re an asshole for not it skews the whole dynamic in the producer’s direction.
---
If there’s got to be a way to cover costs, I think it can be a decent way to do so, but it’s something we should accept begrudgingly and not encourage.
---
How were they killing you on repeat? Once they kill you once, your wanted flag should be cleared and they should be back to slap damage.
---
It is very late. It is 4am in New York. 
---
Why lie though? Only one bundle cost around 2
---
,000 atoms. That bundle gave you around 6 things. The other bundle costed around 
---
1,600 and 1,200 if I remember correctly. So you are throwing out misinformation about the prices. Not all of them was 2,000 each 
---
Given how common replay recorders are on PC/consoles and the odds of people checking their inventories right after a trade, it's extremely odd that not a single video has cropped up.
---
Block them, just a cunt
---
Not reportable
---
They need to change the PvP system. Just steal the system from The Division and have a PvP area.
---
I'm having the same problem. The good news is the T-XX parts are so plentiful in the game you should never need to craft them. You can find dozens of them in an hour if you hunt the PA frame locations. I've got a complete set of max level versions of all 7 PAs in the game, and I keep swapping parts to higher durability ones as I find them. The real trick was finding seven instances of PA frames that didn't stack in my inventory.
---
Being a completionist, I am still on the hunt for all PA part plans and all PA mod plans in the game, as something interesting to do as an endgame while I wait for real endgame content to be added. So, look me up if you get any spare plans: PM me here on Reddit or look me up PC, IGN jchamlin.
---
I record all my gameplay.....and hes right you need proof :/ the amount of people who stream and record it would have been shown by now.
---
thank you. really that was awesome help from you!!! wish xou an good night... sleep well and hope to see yah sooon. :)
---
btw. what gun fo you use??? that was massive damaging. ^.^
---
They're not banning for mods; the people who got banned were using Cheat Engine and then claimed that it was mods that got them banned to try to shift the blame.
---
Ha!
---
Sorry but this, from NOOBKILLER????
---
Yup, this is still a problem in the game. :D
---
30 caps is cheap for 250-300xp.
---
In the middle of the big dry lake is a steel deposit surrounded by water. Not green but open spaced to build huge camps. 
---
Look at my [camp](https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/zealous666/screenshots/fallout-76) do decide if this is something for you. On some pics you see the water, or the purifiers or the steal extractor...
---
From what I have lurked through and read, the M79 is affected by SHOTGUN perks. Don't exactly remember why, but I'm going to experiment with that on my character when I get one and try comparing it with perks on and off.
---
Did it help ?
---
I belive that’s connected to a nuke silo. I remember exiting a nuke silo and the “elevator” was a portapotty. It probably lets you go back in the silo after you have recently done a nuke in case you forgot something. 
---
It's their workshop. If they don't want you to use their stuff, that's their call. I wouldn't do that, but I think the option makes sense to have, even if it's a dick move.
---
Lv35 Vampire's 50cal machine gun, and Lv40 explosive gattling gun. I have perks in heavy weapons. I also used psychobuff right before the attack. The nuke grenades helped. 
---
To prevent this, keep at least 50-100 of the crafting materials the mods scrap into in your stash unbulked (Black Titanium, Aluminum, and Steel). Don't rely on what you carry on your toon, as you might die, lose your junk, forget, and then then craft or repair something that eats your mods.
---
If it's so fake I guess no one wants this 22k caps I have then 
---
Man I sure hope so because that thing has had me perplexed for WEEKS.
---
no, it's not. drops just like when you regularly place your frame. except that someone else can then claim it
---
how did you fit through the window?
---
I have yet to have my camp attacked by anything other than common enemies. I have also been claiming workshops since I first reached one and nobody has attempted to take one from me. Maybe you are simply unlucky and run into asshats all the time.
---
My solution was a pressure plate..
---
How do you get the Prime Receiver for the M79? Buy it/get it from a drop? Or can you scrap to get it?
---
Better tidbit, use nuka-grapes for removing rads. They don't remove mutations, and with 2* cola nut they remove 750 rads and heal you at the same time. Nuka-oranges give stacking tad resist without suppressing mutations.
---
I genuinely laughed at this.
---
Just added
---
How many items were you selling to them?
---
like the community dislike for the company. my wife bought the game for me and it took her 2 days work... so i got a flawed game. so yes there is problems everywhere but you cant sell me a broken game like you will not go to the store and buy a broken tv.. or even ask for refund... so they did sell lies and for that i am pissed of but i do enjoy the game when it doesn't crash or kill my mood for some glitch reason 
---
Gotchoo
---
I prefer AP on 2h weapons personally.
---
That is a lot of spelling errors
---
Yeah, but I’m the real reddit world..it’s not how it works.

Have you ever dropped a nuke on him?
---
Maybe... my luck stat is only 3... lol. What level are you? What workshops are you claiming? I’ve not had my camp destroyed, but have heard of it both on reddit and from other in-game players. I definitely have had people try to take my workshop and they’ve griefed when they couldn’t.
---
If you aren't having fun playing the game, why are you playing it?
---
Nice..thanks heaps, iv been stuck on this for ages!
---
Oh no the 9,000 rounds of 5.56 ammunition I was giving to my son on New Year's Eve just fell through the floor. We're absolutely floored. /s

---
I've personally lost a couple weapons/ammo here and there but is only game, why beg IRL?
---
Because of the game's unbalanced mechanics right now, that Is the common way high levels contest the workshops , they visit the workshops all friendly , and suddebly when you are not paying atention they actívate de workshop and one hit kill you ... It happened to me yesterday, i was lvl 49 and this dude was like 117... Unfortunately for me , he just killed me for my junk, teabagged me and left... Couldn't do anything about it.

She was a good girl when she was younger and she ate her greens.
---
Ha
---
You start shooting me, I'll give you a few chances to stop. If you don't stop through multiple thumbs down, turning off pacifist mode and pulling out all rise, then I have to assume you want to pvp. 
---
Usually when you get the quest to claim workshops. There tends to be enemies you have ti clear out first. That alone gives you 25 caps for clearing. So the workshop almost payed itself. Some could be considered useless but some are also pretty good. There is one that produces packaged food with no rads or condition. 
---
Yeah those are really great if you're pre-level 31 and can't get R2 Starched Genes yet.
---
Thank you!
---
The current system will be perfect once explosive weapons don't deal fatal slap damage 
---
Guess it dies with this account then 
---
&gt; At least melee builds put themselves at risk.
---
The amount of self-kills when you accidentally tag an enemy/friend/object. 
---
Yeah also use Gatling here but just tried the 50 cal and kinda love it, though it chews through ammo big time.
---
For some reason that hasn't happened to me, I think power armour gives explosive resistance but true, I see your point.
---
Nothing is locked except whatever extractor Im running. 
---
Furious is kinda pointless since this game is so stupid and easy (broken) that basicly almost anything dies with 1-2 hits. I would use furious only against queen. 
---
Interesting interaction in the calculation when you are solo; Herd + Class Freak 3 is a no-brainer.
---
Thanks for sharing, really enjoyed the read!

I've been pvp-ing on my new character as of lvl 5. There are some tactics to actually win the fight against a much higher level. At lvl 20 or so I obtained my first chameleon armor. You can hide from anyone while damaging them. If you're in position against your adversary, present him a nuka grenade. This for me has instakilled enemies that were claiming my workshop in that small claim area. Unfortunately I gave away the only nuka cola grenade plan  to a friend (he deserved it), but I found another way that mostly works. Get in position, hit him with a black powder weapon and quickly switch to another weapon to keep damaging him. Most players need about 3 - 5 seconds to understand what's going on which often is too late. Make sure you're using chems like psychobuff. The chameleon armor could keep you hidden during the entire engagement. If your enemy has a recon scoped weapon or a certain mod on power armor, you're at a disadvantage if they spot you once, but otherwise you can reposition and hide if the attack fails and he sees you.
---
Good luck out there and happy new year!
---
Do you need help in any form?
---
No problem. He didn't have anything cool for me this time. Glad to have helped~!
---
&gt;People wouldn't need to server hop if the game was worth a damn right now
---
You didn't stutter.
---
There's only one were you finish the BOS quests in a room protected by a laser grid though?
---
Definitely. And it’s a deeply underestimated and overlooked healing solution. And it’s free!
---
I have uninstalled this game, if you can call this fiasko a game, almost 3 weeks ago so no.
---
Game being worth a damn doesn't mean I'm having no fun. I, among a ton of other people, are doing community-driven events, games, and other contests to MAKE the game fun.
---
Yeah the shop is literally called black powder haha 
---
Crazy, thanks dude! Bit late on the thread but some guy was trying to hustle me 800 caps haha sucker
---
I've played the game for about 30 in game hours, and only encountered mothman once. I was walking along a small road in a forest at night, just focusing on walking forward when I kinda noticed some red dots about 3 meters to my left diagonal. I realised they were eyes and immediately felt fear run over my body, then he poofed up into the air in some kind of black shroud and i yelled "jesus fucking christ". This happened over the course of about 1 and a half seconds. Scared the everliving shit out of me.
---
I spent New years playing FO76, with my SO who was also playing FO76....
---
So what do I raise?
---
You don’t if someone is claiming the workshop you’re near. One of the few exceptions.
---
Chameleon makes it difficult to see the player and impossible to see on the map (also sneaking) and explosive weapons plus sneak peeks, weapon damage perks, bloody mess, etc = ridiculously overpowered weapon.
---
Same here, nothing great but bought the vault tec bed, thanks again
---
+ karma
---
I told him it's not all that frequent on PS4, at least in my experience. I'll probably play with him the end of the week and get him boosted a bit. I'm still 49 on my main, but I've got a melee/armor piercing/strength/damage reduction build, and it's a lot harder to grief me. 
---
Here's the accurate response you're looking for op. The others are wrong, or only half right. 
---
Buddy got to 100 in a day crafting things that give him 11 xp, it's boring as shit I am sure but it's not the worse way to level.
---
Dude I saw him from using VATS, then shot him, and then he teleports into my screen. Scared the shit out of me
---
After reading some random topics about it the glitch might be that it is a well known bug that when you go into trade with someone the game automatically promps you to trade thde first thing you have in your inventory and if you are not carefull back out instead of pressing a quick OK you might offer for sell at a default price your equipped weapon or a stack of ammo or whatever that first item in your inventory is. This annoying feature was present from the start and if this is the hack people who made a mistake in accidently selling their shit complained about i can 100% mark it as their fault and be relieved it's not something others can freely exploit a cautious person like myself.
---
Nope, its not griefing. That being said, your name causes me physical pain and I can only hope it is ironic.
---
If it's explosive, why not use Demolition expert and get a 100% damage boost?
---
They're always friendly and blow you kisses
---
Meanwhile, I’m spawning in at the bottom of a lake enjoying my parasites lol
---
The end-game is pretty lack lustre, I've just resorted to messing with camps/workshops and stalking people for springs.
---
Buddy got to 100 in a day crafting stuff that gave him 11xp, sounds horrible but that seems fast to me.
---
School hours = working hours
---
Ark.

Scorchbeast Rare Drop, Higher chance from Scorchbeast Queen.
---
I do not agree. I did not know about the fatal slap damage that’s just sad. Anyway, what makes you think it is perfect? (Please actually reply I would like to hear!) You are either one shot, or can deal minimal damage to players. Armor seems to do nothing. Anyone with a shotgun, especially explosive, is going to win most fights. I realize there will always be one shotting in games, but it just seems excessive in this game. 
---
Oh ok thanks
---
T51 I find doing Treasure Maps in the Mire Region. I have the complete set done with the Jetpack.
---
T60 is Cranberry, but I'm having trouble completing the set. I think there is just a lot more in the loot tables there.
---
T45 Mire and Toxic Valley.
---
Raider Toxic Valley.
---
Takes a LOT of maps to get these. Very rare.
---
Best of luck to you, hope you come back and look at the new content when it hits. Take care my dude
---
Next logical step: complain on Reddit 
---
What Platform? 
---
She is a synth from the future.
---
Same thing happened to me. I then intentionally went to high population areas so that I could get killed by another player.
---
Just need to raise the level cap once they fix the dupe exploit for good. Or if we are all in a simulation, on the first expansion we awake from it and have no inventory (cause none of it was real) .
---
Shoot it a few times. You'll likely find it outdamages your level 50 stuff.
---
Do you still have him?
---
I'm 65 right now. I only claim ones that have a junk pile. All the other stuff is easy to get. But the ridiculous amount of springs and screws required for power armor makes me want those workshops.
---
Game balance is not a necessary component to game design. Why do you all keep assuming that games MUST be balanced?
---
If that's the case, would class freak one work? Since that drops it to -1.5.
---
Well articulated. 
---
T51 may also be Cranberry as well. Can't quite remember. A couple of PAs can be found in a couple of places.
---
Ah, I've been trying to figure out the last few days why this happens to me now. Didn't see the connection between herd mentality and class freak. Thanks for pointing this out. 
---
No it should have... Bethesda missed a great opportunity
---
Agreed with all points - most prominently of which the graphics engine from the previous decade
---
You're complaining about them so you must care a bit
---
It might, but I haven't tested it. Granted I didn't really "test" this either, I just noticed my AP wasn't going to zero.
---
Exploit for invisibility. A certain perk makes it so when you come out of crouching a certain way while wearing chameleon armor the invisibility sticks until you crouch again. 
---
Nothing,It takes to many resources to lock stuff for it to be worth it.  
---
I have seen people lock silly stuff inside their base like crops and and a single water purifier behind a level 3 door...
---
You can lock part of your camp with a door, and a level 3 lock. Also, even if I get to your stash locker, i will only find my stash. Unless you left everything on the floor, I can't take your stuff. It's not Rust by the way. 
---
If there's no balance there's little incentive to try the weaker stuff, just look at energy weapons, no one wants them because they break quickly and do little damage, 75% of players going melee and another 20% using TSE weapons just isn't interesting at all.
---
Raiders don’t see age, and it wouldn’t be fallout without them. 
---
Get an explosive Harpoon Gun. It is a railgun in terms of destruction, unlike the Gauss rifle.
---
Do you play every game on Easy?
---
Whst exactly are you talking about?
---
1. Why the hell do wires take budget at all? Thats beyond stupid.
---
2. The only reason I ever store things with wires attached is because I CANT target the wire. No matter what angle I approach it from I just cant click on the damn wire to scrap it, so I am forced to just store the item its attached to to remove the wire.
---
Agreed.  If she is a true falloff veteran then she would not play victim 
---
Quite the opposite it's not fun if its not challenging, what's with the salt anyway, can't you discuss why you think balance isn't important rationally
---
Platform? If on xbox ill bring sweet justice for your granny
---
Sorry, no. I'll post again if i ever find him again.
---
I\*
---
Yeap. Interchanging perks is key. Hopefully you can find a legendary weapon with reduced weight to keep for the thing.
---
Ive gound that it dislikes charged gauss rounds.
---
And I feel like I'm being an elitist jerk again by picking on it because I know back in 3 and even 4, I had a very budget PC so graphical quality was never something I could push far. However now with a moderately high end system... I notice it, and it is something I can't un-notice. 
---
Weird. Maybe you’re as lucky as I am not lol. I definitely would’ve figured someone would try and take your workshop by now. So why do you think PvP is balanced? And also who have you fought, because I would think that most people agree that it isn’t. Maybe I’m wrong though.
---
Demolition perk + explosive = 3x the damage of a normal smg. Its regular 100% balistic dmg + 100% explosive dmg + 100% explosive dmg. Explosive weapons are the only way to balance ranged weapons to be on par with how OP melee is in this game. So keep it as is the most awesome cost efficient rangef weapon you will have until you find a better explosive weapon or simply play melee for the same effect.
---
I've seen one guy in the 350s but no-one else near that high, plenty in the low 200s though. 
---
I am being perfectly rational, but I'm refuting some of your beliefs about how games *should* be that you have been taking for granted.
---
he spends time at r/fallout probably 
---
Exactly at 12 oclock i shot 12 flares to the sky in game and had a toast 
---
The Codes were removed automatically from every bodies inventory. Someone at bethesda manually changes the codes each week, it looks like that didn't happen this week. So they have now removed the capability to get new key code pieces while they figure out what they will be changed to. [Computer](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/495059295747047435/529595501037879316/unknown.png) 
---
That's my theory at least. Seeing as the codes did not reset properly earlier.
---
If this is on PS4 and you remember the PSN ID feel free to pm me with it. I have 15 + friends willing to indulge in some "pvp" 
---
Hope you get better, and as people said in this thread try to reach out with family or friends. Dont hide in a videogame. Might feel better now, but isolation is not the best way, longterm.
---
All the best and happy newyear ❤️
---
same =( same.
---
when they're up i'd be glad to help out if you need anymore people to join in on the queen or WS
---
I’m a lead farmer!
---
Actually she sent me a funny pic after the one of her camp, she is not playing the victim at all. I am just mad someone would do this to my grandma lol 
---
" but I'm debating making a pledge to not buy anymore of their games until they use a new game engine "
---
I am actually sick of this argument, there is nothing at all wrong with the engine itself, people like to complain that its old, can't stand up to newer engines etc. hate to break it to you all, most engines are old, engines are constantly changing, evolving. An engine begins life as a bunch of libraries that they consolidate into one and call it an engine, as technology changes, these libraries are changed to match. This is happening with Gamebryo too, Fallout4 they switched to x64 and a kinda hybrid PBR rendering system, Fallout76 they completely revamped terrain rendering, gone full PBR and added static global illumination (via enlighten) into the mix. From a game data perspective, a large amount was added/changed to accomodate FO76 and the online components. Is it perfect? no.
---
But simply put, they are not going to abandon an engine that they have put many years of effort into, that their dev teams know the ins and outs of, and all the silly little quirks, their rendering/engine teams know every inch of the code, in favour of a brand new engine, that would take a considerable amount of effort to complete, then waiting on the game dev teams to learn how to use it.
---
But hey, feel free to boycot until they change engines, im just telling you, you'll be waiting a long while.
---
PS. UE4 (which people like to use as an example of what Bethesda should use) is older than Gamebryo, because its original code base, some of which is still in use today, is from UE1.
---
I got the sturdy armor limbs when I was like lvl 20 but that's it.
---
I went to a party and played fallout 76 for a lil bit and now I'm just playing on my laptop
---
PS4, but thank you! 
---
Bethesda screwed up the code reset this week and have now disabled all access to the nuclear silos/gathering of code pieces while they figure out how to fix it. 
---
That's what I'm assuming, everyone else is saying they disabled it for new years, either way there is no official word as to why they are disabled. Just that they are.
---
I am unsure if she saw the names, we asked her but she is asleep right now. Thank you! 
---
There's a cabin at the edge of the map sonewere that says her saw the bomb fall in the distance. Will have to look if this is the one you are thinking of. Also in that cabin I think it say about hoping anyone who find this place can make use his cabin.
---
If you tried it today, they locked it because Bethesda was doing an event or something in whitesprings
---
I don't care if i get some downvotes on this, but if you still have the serums, I'd like to buy some @ maybe 100-150c each. Ofc you can sell it to a vendor for 200, but there's always an opportunity to help someone who needs it.
---
Yep. This was almost exactly what I was about to say. Easiest way to stack up plans as well. The only time taking a workshop is not profitable is when you get disconnected before completing the first event. Which happens to me about ten percent of the time....
---
My SO dozed off around 10pm.
---
I never said it was balanced. I only said that it's basically non existent. I have not had anyone try to fight me. But if they did attack me, I could literally walk away. I have pacifist mode on because I enjoy throwing half a dozen plasma grenades every so often. I don't play this game for pvp, and I have found that it is 100% avoidable. Pretty much every server I get on has 0-2 claimed workshops. People don't really care about workshops either.
---
Well if she happens to remember be sure to update! 
---
That doesn't sound very fun.
---
There's a lot of stories like this and sometimes I wonder if it's just some elaborate story to brag about your haul from duping yourself. It's kind of a double standard that the community demands proof of alleged bugs (the damage bug, forced trading, stealing power armor) but then just accept and upvote posts like these. To me it doesn't make sense because duping your CAMP and duping items are two completely different processes that aren't really related to one another. Also, there's not necessarily a requirement to drop the items you're duping in order to achieve duping. Most video guides on youtube utilize a world container. The only thing that gets dropped are the crafted items which trigger a server disconnection required in the duping process.
---
I'm just a little confused how OP got all this into Lewisburg Station given that over 1000 lbs of encumberance you craaaaaawl and the dupers camp couldn't have been too close to an existing location. Secondly, OP is at the cap limit, which is common for dupers who dupe nuka colas. Also, I'm not aware of any way that you can drop caps, so unless OP is heavily involved in the market or has a daily alarm clock to collect caps on cap restock, I'm not sure how they got to cap limit. Maybe the alleged duper dropped duped nuka colas and radaways, but then why did our Robin Hood decide to capitalize on the duped goods we're supposed to be celebrating them for riding the servers of? Post history does not suggest involvement in the market, so I'm wondering what legitimate means OP got to cap max by. Not saying it's impossible, but it doesn't paint things perfectly.
---
Lastly, toxic water has three somewhat useful purposes. One is crafting chems. It's an ingredient, I believe. Along the same vein, with how the trap disarm perk has been removed, the new low effort way to power level is to dupe components needed to craft, run a macro to craft hundreds, and then go AFK while the macro does the work for you for 255 items (because that's the craft limit). The more likely solution, as far as I see, is using it as a rad giving aid item if you're running a min-max build. With a min-max build, you purposely keep yourself at low health (usually via rads) in order to stack damage buffs. The adrenal reaction serum, bloodied legendary effect, and many perks will increase this further. It's especially popular with melee/unarmed builds given you can stack a decent amount of DR/ER perks/buffs on your character to keep them at 25% health without being completely fragile. Bolstering and unyielding effects work well with this, as well as scaly skin and grounded. If you carried around toxic water you could use it as a mobile rad item and not rely on things like rad zones, barrels, water sources, or eating significantly more food since one toxic water is 30 rads. This is also helpful in teams when some members are running rad sponge to help others that aren't min-max builds. In that case, team mates healing your rads lowers a min-max build's damage output, but toxic water on a hot key can maintain a balance. Lastly, one source for toxic water is an abandoned mine shaft not far from Lewisburg station.
---
In OP's post history, it seems like they were interested in an unarmed build, but maybe I'm linking a connection where there was none. But here's what bothers me the most about this whole story... Lewisburg is an easy spot to dupe from. The main ingredients for duping is a crafting bench, a container, and someone else on server so they can return to the same server where duped items are stored. There are 3 containers directly behind the crafting bench at Lewisburg station with infinite carry weight. That would make it easy to craft, place, and lag out from server. You also have a vendor there which can serve as a quick way to trigger the lag that drops you from server. 
---
I'm not saying OP made everything up, duped all these items, and wanted somewhere to brag about their exploit gains, but all the pieces are there and evidence is scant. A screen grab of an inventory screen doesn't tell us anything. If you want to fight against dupers, get rid of the items. More items probably bogs it down, and having three thousad dupes on one character is likely less stressful to a server than having 1.5k dupes on two characters.
---
&gt; Ok I‘m in: if you place a wire through a window, you can replace the window later with a wall to flip power through walls.
---
Good to know.
---
FYI, your post has been requested MANY times. But, Bethseda would have to deal with the place being constantly nuked first
---
It might be a regular bed that you reskin by using the side arrows. Check the beds and see if any say something like 1/2 or 1/3.
---
Shame, Im over level 200 with a great build and would troll those people for a few days for that. Maybe a few ps4 players will step up to enact justice. 
---
as someone who is green and speaks in tongues cause i have 18 mutations GET THEM ALL
---
It takes an even more special kind of idiot to give money to a company deliberately ripping it's fans off. 
---
they do ....let me guess you think the "vault tec bed" plan is the wood bed with the vault tec sheets right?.....no it's the cheap looking bed ....you are looking for the plans caleed "modern bed" sold by the vendor in whitesprings mall
---
Will do! 
---
Just saying, by clicking on her c.a.m.p you can repair everything at once (Obviously it costs some material, but thats atleast something)
---
I think it sucks that depresses you, you did the work which is part of the fun, you got what you worked for also fun, If you did it for validation that would be sad but also pathetic so I don't think it's that, I don't get why it depresses you, it would be like worrying about what your neighbors doing in the privacy of his own home. Congrats bro, be happy with yourself not worry about others you don't know.
---
Like scorchbeasts dropping ultracite plans, bos event dropping bos related plan, region event plan rewards etc. If the best way would be to do 1 event for all plans, it would dull the process.
---
Anyone else get where it stopped showing you the next location of the overseer's stash is? I now just stumble upon them at random. After so many the quest log just says find the Overseer's stash but doesn't say/show on the map where.
---
Hey bro I'm sorry that happened to you but if you are on xbox I would love those caps for myself and buddies. 
---
My favourite thing is how she managed to record a holotape that lasts 2 minutes saying how disappointed she is in us for launching a nuke have it ready and waiting for the second we launch it and get the tape in and out of the site without us ever seeing her all in the blink of an eye!
---
Melee is so OP in this game that explosive bullets are the only way to make ranged weapons on par with it. And they come with a big drawback of not being able to use them close range. The reason you see people using melee in Whitesprings despite having explosive weapons is that they almost fo the same damage without the drawback of kiling yourself. The only thing you should be complaining about is buffing laser weapons to be on par with thd rest.
---
Very first thing i bought in the atoms store. 
---
I'm so tight-fisted i wouldn't even buy something with my free-atoms until now... Prices were just too high.
---
But 800 for a Set of 4 Items felt like a good deal. :)
---
well? is that what happened?
---
Also, I have a laser pistol I use sometimes. It seems to last longer than the other variants I've tried, though the burning automatic scattershot rifle was fun and good. It lasts long enough to make a good backup weapon for shooting ghouls, scorched, and mole rats. Repairing it doesn't cost much, and it gives me a good way to burn through fusion cells that would otherwise go to waste. I'm also bullish on armor piercing automatic pipe pistols.
---
People would still server hop after doing the daily. 
---
Lol. This screams salt. I've yet to see someone post that they've been banned, and post the mods they were banned with. If you've been banned, i'd wager that you used a exploit/cheat or a bug to further yourself in the game. Don't cheat and you won't be banned
---
Mod User here.
---
Yeah we told her she can repair, but she is still figuring out how to do it. We will be on with her tonight to show her what to do. 
---
PC sorry mate
---
That's very country roads of you
---
Well it's been said plenty but no one wants to acknowledge this actually exists 
---
Well I hope you can find an affordable replacement weapon that is just as good or better with those caps 
---
&gt; Coming from a person that has spent like 800 bucks on league of legends and a good amount on fortnite skins I buy cosmetics cause 1. I look cool af 2. It supports the developers of the game 
---
And here you arrive to the crux of the issue - those are both free to play games. Fallout 76 is not free to play but it models its monetary scheme as one.
---
As for the video, 5:51-6:20 is the heart of the argument:
---
[https://youtu.be/Ce5CDrq4dGg?t=351](https://youtu.be/Ce5CDrq4dGg?t=351)
---
Also 7:33-838:
---
[https://youtu.be/Ce5CDrq4dGg?t=453](https://youtu.be/Ce5CDrq4dGg?t=453)
---
The context of the video is mostly to do with loot boxes as you stated but the argument presented regarding the value of cosmetics is universal. Fallout 76's implementation is just one wrung less worse than those stated in the video. 
---
Bear in mind that Fallout 76 is a full priced AAA game (not anymore but Bethesda would if it could get away with it) ALSO with microtransactions (which aren't that micro), that heavily front-loads the free atoms in game so that any person may, like the OP, run into a situation where your desire to get the item now is strong enough that you'd rather pay for it than grind out the required atoms.
---
You even admit the value in the cosmetics by poking fun at how I sound jealous to you for not having said cosmetic. 
---
So in that one original statement, you both downplay their value ("merely cosmetic") and play up its value ("Someone just sounds a little jelly OP got a sick suit and you don’t").
---
Somewhat hypocritical, don't you think?
---
So what is it - "merely cosmetic" or something to be jealous over? Cause, it can't be both.
---
Probably but I'm done was the last straw for me
---
I know where you are talking about and took a short video of it. I can only conclude it's because the train cars are only being held up on the side of the hill by the tree... I am speculating but I guess it's the sound of the train car wanting to slide down the hill/moutain but can't because a tree is blocking it. Seems like something Bethsda thought be cool but it's not implimentented in a lot of places. 
---
Man this is a part of the game. Feel bad for your gran but you should know that this can happen... 
---
Thank you for the offer, I appreciate it and know she would get a kick out of it lol 
---
Gotten a few offers for PS4 just got to see if she remembers the names! 
---
Yeah, game frustrates me too. I would feel the same way too. Happy New Year, it is gonna be a good one! 
---
I hate people like that.. you spend time on building something and someone comes and destroys everything.. 
---
And wow respect to your grandma 600 hours in fallout 4, and now still playing 76 until now that’s awesome. 
---
I'm currently not home but they did it for a event. Look @FO76 Twitter
---
I hopped for 4 hours last night and only got it to trigger three times, but got the homemade on the last one.
---
Honestly man I get your point, but people will always take the easiest possible route to an award, so will animals. This is Beth's fault for being incompetent, sure the dude who steals from an unlocked ungaurded, no camera bank is an asshole, but come on man you have to protect your bank, Beth didn't do that and it was obvious,they were also made aware in alpha. They also fix it it the laziest way possible, Beth is in over their head in multiplayer and it's just as much Beth's fault as it is our animal programming.
---
It always seems to be Level 100+TSEs who don't get a Level 30 doesn't want to fight them. Do I look stupid?
---
On the PvP thing I'd like it if the game auto-teamed opt out people for things like events. I understand a workshop is a PVP location but if I'm not trying to capture the work station why should it be trying to trip PvP no matter what I do? It auto teams people for the SBQ. 
---
I just lock my front door to keep the enemies that eventually spawn when at my camp outside, but most of my walls have open windows to my workbenches so people who want to use them can.  And I leave two doors open on the second level open so people can exit (or enter with marsupial) without issue.  They can have my crops and dirty water if they want too.
---
Looking for bod bomber jacket if anyone has one
---
Indeed check my thread linked in that comment. :)
---
I think you're supposed to assume that she's in the middle of her journey as you follow her. As in, when you get to Flatwoods, she might just be getting to BoS. Makes you feel a bit like you're chasing a ghost tho
---
And soju or sake. 
---
Wtf where are all these people when I need them. Haven't met a single generous person in this game, other than the one guy who let me tag along in an event

Sorry that’s dumb
---
Apparently its happened to a couple of other dudes too.
---
I have mysterious stranger level 3 so don’t know if this maybe a factor as it’s Vats related
---
Mmmmm game batter
---
Just search the sub my dude. A lot of people have asked this. Bethesda shut the silos down for an event in whitesprings. 
---
I think they said via twitter they were shutting the nukes down for 24 hours for new years and some new years event in game.
---
Wish they would notify all players via in game and not their twitter.
---
Tbh I comment that in every post I see with someone complaining about something
---
Not to sound noobish, im old and slow and barely keeping up with all words and stuff like griefing...what is griefing? ( english not native language)
---
🤣🤣
---
I know this sounds like a joke but you can actually talk to them when you pacify them using the wasteland whisperer. They actually get an interact button on them.
---
Unfortunately all they ever say to you is "Go away, bleeder". I keep trying them hoping one day they actually have a proper conversation. Maybe one day....
---
I’d love to join 
---
I didn’t knowwww the gun was loaded 
---
Rifle perks, my mutants explosive 10mm does 260~ damage by stacking commando and demo experts 
---
Sorry just woke up and still tired. 
---
Game crashed.  It's 2:00am so I'll check again in the afternoon. 
---
Interesting... But I agree, go find a corner of the map way past map markers or a good deep water feature and dump that crap. It does nobody any good, especially to the server and your fellow players. Screencap it, report it, and dump it. Otherwise, redditors will be watching...
---
I've looked at the twitter. They made a post asking for pictures at the whitesprings bar which is completely unrelated to the nuclear silos. Everyone is saying that they stopped the silos so people could come to an event. 
---
I don't see taking pictures as an event.
---
I've had this happen a few times in Charleston. I will kill a Super Mutant or Scorch... go to loot it's body seconds later and it vanishes and the mutant/Scorch respawns suddenly next to me. 
---
Speaking of sudden spawns, Grafton seems to constantly have Super Mutants suddenly spawn RIGHT next to me. Once I stopped to respond to a text message and watched as a few Mutants suddenly came into being RIGHT next to me. They all started attacking me, I quickly grabbed the controller and tried to fight them off. I am assuming this game has mobs respawn at certain intervals, regardless if there is someone standing where they spawn or not. 
---
Just like deathclaws. They really just want hugs. 
---
Not to accuse anyone of cheating/glitching o messing up...but i have many times almost sold my weapons ( i carry 3) to player if its on a laggy server...i think its related to that. Ive done so insanely much deals with random ppl and never encountered that glitch. 
---
When you drop an item, it appears in a bag at your feet. This sounds extremely fishy.
---
Since your username is public the reality the best you could get is 1.5 factor auth. 
---
All I'm saying is that people don't believe it because it hasn't happened to them .. consider it a PSA ... I've spent that much time and effort in this game and to lose my best weapon in this way is disgusting .... I've got fully modded x01 suit with shocks jetpack, full Vanguard marine armor .. just about every camp plan I want and 22k caps ... I was sorted then this happens .. as I said in original post I can look past most problems that doesn't actually affect me in person but for a bug like this to exist actually disgusts me
---
Yeah I know. But since all the sad people yesterday, sitting alone at the bar, I think It’s time to start the campaign again.
---
I'll up vote most suggestions that start this way. Wish the trend had taken off more. 
---
Since this "Trade exploit" has been proven false, unless you provide some type of proof there's no way to validate what you're saying. Sorry bud. Have fun in your journeys. 
---
K cool story
---
Nevermind. Good morning :-)
---
Really, it’s connected to the number of doors in your camp? Or, it was, and it’s still a problem? I had no idea. I need to go check mine for duplicates.
---
Nah. It’s not.
---
Some people may be doing it to leach xp. On several occasions I have seen a small group walk towards the door, and only the high levelled character goes in, whilst the rest stand outside the dungeon door. After a while I tested it, and sure enough, as long as the event triggers, you don't have to actually go inside to get the quest reward. Personally I think it's inefficient. It's much better for the higher levelled characters to carry, and the lower levels tag as many mobs as possible.
---
I believe the game adds them in the order they're in in your inventory. My inventory had a 79, a 100, three 50s, and a 55, in that order, and once my core ran out, it switched to the 79.
---
I think it's just that we've all had multiple run ins with someone being a douche, and we hear about everyone else's encounters. 
---
They either balance TSE's or Balance the game around TSE's.
---
If they do the later, then to do end game stuff it's "Have a TSE or go home" - So a FU to the Non-duper's and the "Honest" player
---
or
---
They balance TSE's by making the 2shot base weapon damage (No Perk mods) and making the explosive effect not effected by Perks, then it just becomes a GOOD weapon, rather than gamebreaking.
---
I don't know if they are region locked but they probably are because my country has a thing where most players put NZ in their username and there is a high concentration of those players on my servers and we are a small country
---
Free dmg mitigation so yes
---
This i don't think the mod systems is gonna be what people believe. Because one they need to make money via atom store and two they already want paid mods in their games. Most likely mods will be made in a approval style setup through creation club at the cost of atoms. Similar to FO4 style but without the ability to use nexus to mod the game itself outside of user end stuff.
---
The game is basically FO4 turned into online game, so of course the PvP is unbalanced. They did not have to balance PvP in FO4.
---
nice job betesda take out the only thing left to do on holiday god can they be more stupid or is this their max?
---
I wish some of the events didn't automatically enroll you into it EACH time you walk into the zone...  It's annoying to hear the same scripted event just because you walked into an area where there is an event going on... then if you leave and then walk in you get the same speech and are enrolled automatically... I wish there was a way to turn off the quest BEFORE it automatically gives it to you. 
---
Because the PvP is stupid as fuck. What chance does a level 30 have against a level 100 running full Assasin gear with a gun that does over 2x the damage?
---
And remember the other players are also Vault 76 members, people we've spent around 25 years with. Suddenly they are all hell bent on killing each other when the marketed aim of the game is starting to rebuild?
---
Some forms of PvP in the game are great, some are just absolutely fucking stupid as shit. Worse than ARK, Rust, DayZ and a bunch of other titles. And the fact you can accidentally trigger PvP even if you opt for PVE is even more stupid as others have said previous games in the series let you know you're doing something naughty. This one goes "fine, fine, fine, YOU FUCKING CRIMINAL!" with zero indication it is about to happen.
---
No no and god no.
---
Do you know what your asking?.
---
This is a slippery slope and one i don't want to see effecting gameplay at all. If your not willing to jump servers then just wait the 24 hours.
---
some what like that, or pay to play on private servers, as they need to be able to cover the cost of additional resources including CPU/RAM, and most importantly storage for mods, that will need to be stored and downloaded to each client that connects.
---
Not saying its how its gonna happen or I agree with it, or anything, just trying to be a tad bit realistic about how modding in an online game is going to work, as too many people think it will solve every issue.
---
Hmmm. Interesting. Didn’t know that. Thanks for the tip :)
---
Haha and you still got rekt
---
Someone linked a post earlier that lead to it. I'll try to find the link again. For now i shall eat the crow.
---
Good riddance.
---
Indeed buddy should always consider it from their side.
---
As someone that played FO4 and spent countless hours of my life building up the settlements, this type of FO76 camp is underwhelming and unimmersive because it’s a plain box shape and looks like parts are floating. 
---
Greaser jacket and newsboy cap
---
Question: Anyone else find it humorous some of the threats they saw while they are running away or backing up to get away from you? I often find myself talking aloud responding to them... "why you running away? You talk big and bad but seems like you want to escape". 
---
I couldn't activate the trap....
---
Thanks dude😊
---
I think more powerful weapons go through durability at a faster pace. I've noticed that I can fight a bunch of robots for an hour with Voice of Set and lose maybe 10-15% durability, but one mission hitting scorched with my tricked out hunting rifle (which is quite a bit stronger) will bring it down to about 50%. This is a good thing, actually, because in a game with open world PvP, you don't want one person running around with an extremely powerful weapon just killing everyone without stopping ever.
---
I mean the way it is initiated is perfect. What needs work is scaling to give skill and perks a place to shine vs just 1 shotting. PvP should be like fighting a boss
---
Personally I'm more annoyed at pve being poorly balanced, you've got weapons that barely kill ghouls and then weapons that can 1 shot a scorchbeast, it's ridiculous
---
I used to get it most often when my camp was at whitesprings and I was server hopping to buy a unique plan from a vendor. Something about that and moving your camp can cause it to happen.
---
And if you’re trying to play without the exploit, it’s a pain because you can’t build anything new. For example, adding a wire to a power connector so you can add a light can’t be done because you’re BUILDING a wire. Now you have to scrap 100-500 of 12 different items and hope you don’t scrap something expensive you like to keep stores when you spam scrap (like a decontamination arch that costs cobalt). That’s also why when you see turret posts with 60 turrets they’re all machine guns. They’re unpowered 
---
I'ma be honest with you Ultima Onlines PvP was probably the most fun i've EVER had in pvp, in any game. 
---
That's all i had to add XD
---
Check the challenges list. There’s a challenge for all her tapes and it lists each location. 
---
The place is gatekept by people who exclusively like New Vegas only.
---
It's a lost cause. 
---
That worked! Many thanks.
---
As a heavy trader / seller i can tell you people cannot steal items from you per say. I have done 100s of trades and never had a single issue.
---
But i think i have nailed down what these complaints are exactly.
---
I noticed when i am trying to set a price on an item and someone clicks request on another item. It messes up the item i am setting the price on and it places that price on the item below it.
---
So technically someone could buy and item from you that you didn't want to trade if your not quick enough.
---
Why do games need to be "balanced"? 
---
Why can't some things in the game be better than the other things?
---
You are taking the idea that "games should be balanced" for granted.
---
That's funny because I swear half the threads detailing FO76 experiences in here are designed to drop 🚨 *MY GIRLFRIEND* 🚨 within the opening paragraph
---
There is a cap on how much you can be overencumbered until your speed drops dramatically. Also if you level an alt they won’t be so fragile against local enemy spawns and possibly drop junk they can’t fit in their stash
---
&gt; I am actually sick of this argument, there is nothing at all wrong with the engine itself 
---
There are a ton of problems with the game engine in its current iteration.
---
We just recently had a 10+ year problem fixed i.e. physics tied to framerate locked to 60-something fps that only took 2 weeks to resolve under immense social and business pressure.
---
There is still a problem where if you pick up an item among multiple off a table or similar surface, they all fall down at once a small fraction and can bounce off said surface. That's been around a similarly long time.
---
Mobs and items somewhat regularly clipping through the floor and walls out of interaction range - yup, still around. 
---
There are so many that you could probably do a Buzzfeed-like listicle like "27 problems unique to the Creation Engine that you won't find in popular game engines. You won't believe what the 5th one is!", or something like that.
---
Could they fix all these issues and bring the engine up to even just being on par with current industry gold standard engines? Maybe. 
---
Judging by how they implemented multiplayer and online in Fallout 76, I'm not confident that Bethesda will put in the time and effort or perhaps even have the competency to do so. 
---
Maybe it's just me but the devs feel more like code hackers than industry-leading programmers.
---
Lol. I loved when they put Trammel into the game, it kept a good chunk of the people that whined out of my PKing areas. Then again this was when it was easy to trigger me by crying online.
---
So sad to hear this happened to her. When she rebuilds her camp, get her to host a housewarming party! I’m sure plenty of us on PS4 would love to join and drop off some gifts for your grandma 🤗
---
I didn't confirm it, but I read on here yesterday (maybe day before) that the repair all option uses a lot of extra resources. 
---
It's not a thing. You dropped it. It happens. I've dropped plenty of important stuff.
---
just drop one ammo then transfer into that bag it creates if you wanna drop stuff
---
Wow. This truly started my 2019 off right. Thank you. 
---
it hasnt ever happened. You dropped it. Pay better attention. Sound like a kid.
---
Sure. I got some downvotes, but you'll always be you.
---
now lets play a game, tell me an engine that doesnt have issues? Frostbite? UE4? Cryengine? 
---
They all have issues varying in size, Some of what you actually class as issues with the engine are issues with Havok, as I have experienced similar issues in other (non Gamebryo) games. Others of what you have stated as an issue, is rather an optimization and I can understand from their perspective as to why. I did say it was not perfect, but there isnt enough issues, or big enough issues to warrant a full engine rewrite, not with the time and cost that it would take factored into it.
---
Because you accidentally dropped it. You are right, why would you drop it, you clearly did it on accident and feel bad and now trying to blame the game. SAD.
---
Power Armor also insta kills yourself when you kill something up close. Try going to the Scourge Beast Queen, just when you think that you are having a good time a normal mob jumps right in front of you and you end up killing yourself because they were too close...
---
I found out the other day that I wasn't using Scrounger or Pharma Farma correctly for quite a long time (since level 6 or 7). Or rather, I hadn't been using them AT ALL. Turns out, you need to press an extra button for them to take effect. The prompt does appear below the box's inventory window, but you will miss it if you're not looking for it, like I wasn't since the second or third thing that I looted. I didn't know about it until I read it on the Internet weeks later. You might want to put a note ON THE PERK CARD to detail how it works. Now it just says "when you 'search' a box", which to me, and I'm sure many others, means looking inside it.
---
Or you can just make it a passive that randomly adds more items for that player to loot, the way the perk description suggests.
---
This. Drop one bullet or something then put the rest in.
---
Yup and I will keep rekting you while you suck my XDs.
---
I play on Xbox one, how do you bring that list up on consoul? I am on google now but so far no luck. 
---
Very well said OP its sad to lose a community member like yourself but we all understand. I hope you check back in at a later time to see how the game progresses.
---
I pick up burnt books for this reason 
---
My useless ammo is also a good starting point 
---
The two spot i kno for fact are at the wotoga shopping center and the pleasant valley ski resort trader. I git it first try a the ski resort
---
I have one, but she is hammered and passed out...

Need a job? I'm thinking of turning my Combat Zone camp into more of a brothel.

I saw the limb mod on the Watoga robot vendor.

She stole Moo Moo's greens? Evil biatch must pay.

Which system and what caps offer? I have BoS knight plans
---
At the responders base, in the cash register where the vendor is standing 
---
Stealth rifleman reporting in.  
---
First of all, Mr. Sandman gives you x3.5 SACs at max rank, so you're wrong there. Also, suppressors aren't much of a restriction as anything you'd want to use for a stealth build can use one anyway.  
---
But regardless: with the right perks plus either a Chameleon armor piece and Stand Fast or the X-01 with stealth torso, there's... really no way you'll ever be seen short of an enemy running directly into you or Scorchbeast BS. (Their AI has been thoroughly proven to somewhat ignore stealth, but even they can be dealt with by hiding intelligently.) SACs are very, very high-damage, and can take down a group of mobs in short order. About the only two things I can't do in the game that way are Uranium Fever and the SBQ fight--and it's honestly just easy enough to pull out All Rise and power armor for those.  
---
Long story short... I literally only play as a stealth build, and I have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Nah, you are just being a dick.
---
Thanks. Good to know.
---
We also need pics to prove the validity of how cute your character is in this dress. 
---
Last interaction I had with another player while wearing my red dress  was being shot in the back while trying to get some plans from a defend event at a workshop.
---
Looks like I'm not cute. :(
---
I had this happen to me and I wonder if you drop another item after your first bag disappears if it will drop an updated bag with original item still in it. 
---
I found out after awhile that r/fo76filthycasuals is wherr the memes/funny stuff go to do well.  Fo76 is for the "to the player that", "bethesda fix..." And "this is the last straw" posts lol.
---
 r/fo76filthycasuals
---
As there is really no penalty for wrecker types, it's what happens.  As a LVL 100+ Grandad I avoid by building off the beaten track and watch the map.  If needs be I'll use my double shot explosive, but in F76 I do try to avoid arsehole types.  In COD or GOW, bring them on, but in F76 I am more forgiving mostly and definetely more suspicious.
---
Those guys were creating content by destroying her camp, be grateful they brought interactivity and conflict to this game
---
Pardon,  could someone explain  "rule 10" and why my suggestion tag was removed because of it? This is a post of suggestions,  why was the tag not appropriate?
---
We will see, if she doesn’t have enough resources my husband and I will get them for her lol 
---
Thank you ❤️ I will mention this to her! 
---
$25, early release, &amp; 65x more viewership on Twitch. I don't see what to snap on. Did i mention early release?
---
They were camp attacking my base + shooting at me together repeatedly until I had no health. I ignored them entirely in hopes that they would bail until after first death (post mywanted deletion). They WERE wanted for griefing my base, but as I stated before, no one wanted to go after them. Hitting revenge earned me an insta death and ignoring them left them shredding my base apart with a bounty no one acknowledged. Leaving server was the best option.
---
I realised this last night when I looted a container at the mega Red Rocket. The workshop was owned but had absolutely nothing built. No extractors, no attempts to use the place. I picked the lock on a normal lootable container and "You are now wanted" appears. I get that taking from an extractor that's locked would flag me as I'm stealing resources someone else has put effort into collecting but when I loot a normal loot container, even a locked one, I should not be penalised for it.
---
I like the mechanic of wanted people not being able to see others on the map but in this situation, as you found, it is infuriating. Flagged for something that shouldn't be happening and then you're left with the choice of trying to play normally with the threat of someone roflstomping you without a word for a tiny bounty. Alternatively, you can try to find someone to kill you just to remove the stupid bounty but with the ability to see other players you're left hoping someone is where you are or where you go to.
---
All of the issues I'm having with the game would be fine if this was an early access title. It isn't and that's bordering on criminal. I want to like and enjoy the game but it's such a lazy and badly implemented expansion for Fallout 4.
---
 My first char actually had a CAMP up there. My main now, Jenny Jones, has a CAMP north of the Nuka Cola Plant and uses the PA station in a barn down the hill.
---
 My X0-1 is bugged and takes no damage so I don't actually repair it. ;) I put mods on it at the Whitespring Bunker so I never really need it. I did build it there though. ;)
---

---
Hats on top of PA is pretty ridiculous given the nature of the game. I really hope they don't start turning it into this goofy Disney creation. 
---
Which one?  All they seem to have is ultra-light build
---
Or just have pacifist mean true pacifism.
---
You can't be hurt by other players at all and you can't damage other players' stuff.
---
Steal the pacifism system from GTAV.
---
Had luck recovering an accidental drop by walking a few steps and dropping something else (bag then reappeared with everything in it).
---
Also, hi Nemo. ;)
---
it doesn't work like you think it should.
---
Works on Xbox, or at least it did last night. 
---
Saw it on watoga train vendor
---
And do you know why?
---
You're lucky, they don't even charge for me,  literally pointless things, I have dropped many legendary heads, think they're just really buggy :-)
---
I don't quite follow, you are saying it is sad that Bethesda listens to the Filthy Casuals? Please clarify, thank you :)
---
It took the realism out of the game. Besides, killing the whiners made pk’ing even more sweet lol.
---
Yep fits well with the fact that you only lick those XDs. Not sure if you even get the irony in your post :\^)
---
Hmm, I may do that. I suppose, thinking about it, I would be the least objective person to model my own face! 
---
I use one a fair bit. I think it is calculated as you say however I find that high charges often don't actually do the damage that it initially says it does. I think it's kind of glitched like the two shot was. I think that the best value is to do up to three charged with instigating or two shot perk. Also, my legendary version doesn't irradiate, do you have a legendary one?
---
i run power armor exclusively with my one handed melee build if your strength is below 11 the frame will bring it to 11 if you are over 15 the suit will not affect your strength and you will keep it at 15 
---
because of how it is
---
Why did you assume it would work exactly like you wanted it to?
---
Fair enough, it did really hurt the population in the long run. Also glad to see a fellow UO player out and about :)
---
It can definitely be both cause it is merely cosmetic grants you no in game bonuses and you can be jealous over it. Just like I’m jealous over the people that have the black knight in fortnite cause I didn’t buy the battle pass but they don’t have an advantage so idgaf and I don’t get salty about it. Cosmetics need to have value or else we wouldn’t buy it just like you wouldn’t buy an ugly ass shirt at a store cause you feel like your money wouldn’t be worth for said item. So what I said isn’t hypocritical. 
---
And sure man it’s a triple A game that sold for 60 bucks but it’s a live service games are already expensive af to develop you think they can keep a game alive with just 60 bucks? That’s sort of unrealistic. Also such a bad argument cause there’s games that cost an initial price to buy and also have a subscription you have to pay. 
---
Games do cosmetic micro transactions so they don’t have to force players to pay for a subscription they might not be able to pay and don’t allow people that have money get an in game advantage. But allow the people with money to keep the game alive with just looking like they want to look. The game has more than enough outfits you can pick from the cosmetics from the store is all choice man. 
---
And it’s alright to have different view points and I do see some of your points but with how this game is it’s reasonable enough to have an atom shop if there was an atom shop in fallout 4 I’d be pissed af. 
---
Happy New Years by the way!
---
A map inside of a map..? How will it make people to go to whitesprings ? 
---
You sad, sad ten year old. Does your mother know your up so late?
---
IIrc, Pete Hines confirmed that they're working on it and we can expect it towards the end of 2019
---
Events in the cranberry bog like distance thunder, census violence, etc is where I found them.
---
I don't think any of my storiee have had a happy ending yet. I'll have to fix that!!
---
I get grief every time I play once got invited to team, these 100+ players fast traveled to me then proceded to try to kill me. This has happened a few times to were I am very leery of accepting team invites now.
---
Super Troll wins again!  Brilliant!
---
This would do literally nothing lol
---
yea people are just shit, i have been telling them to stop spreading bullshit and lies, but im the one thats wrong sorry to say but people are still gonna argue with you
---
Oh right,now that you said i remember i read it only works for workshops
---
 Go to Harper's Ferry. As you go through the hole to the door that leads to the merchant you might notice display cases scattered about. They are upstairs too and Marine Armor plans grow there. ;)
---
If you don't mind me asking would you say melee is worth it all the way I've always liked it but things like scorched beast queen have me worried is there any late-game struggles with melee that set it behind at all?
---
Emmm...sounds you are just replying things with no sense to lure my into a discussion. No thx
---
Oh god please no 
---
Exactly this!  Stealth sniper build.  Max stealth + escape artist + chameleon armor and I very rarely get seen by enemies.  I don't have the cool explosive weapons yet but I have a 2 shot lever action and 2 shot dragon and can 1 hit most enemies.   
---
Loved this. Nothing is better than harmless revenge where you know the douche nozzle on the other end is spitting feathers 
---
God forbid i lose a couple caps and some junk.
---
oh I do one a bit better. I lock every single door in the entire factory at level 3. Then I cover every door except the front in concrete blocks. Then I put a shotgun turret behind those doors. But the front door? Three shotgun turrets and a spotlight. I also wall off the hole on the second floor and the cargo doorway with shotgun turrets behind those to make sure that ANYONE that tries to get inside the factory while I'm controlling it gets Wanted beforehand. I've never had someone successfully contest it lol
---
There a clown costume at one of the nuke site camps I think. I've found some all over the place. And make sure you do the heart emoji when trying to befriend the wendigo 
---
I would gladly pay a monthly fee IF we see that it actually improves game ( servers, bugs , glitches and so on )
---
Was there supposed to be something going on there? It’s useless if they try to start a social event without some kind of in-game announcement. 
---
Shit I dropped my full suit yesterday I’d give it to you for free if I still had it  :( 
---
"Mature", edgy 17-year old being smart there. Did you forget what kind of a comment you replied originally or don't you just get it?
---
I do them for so and plans, not really for the resources. 
---
I love doing this too its always fun waiting by the vault exit with a couple of decent guns for a new player 
---
Sorry my man to tell ya but we are unable to do this at this current time. Hopefully in the future they will allow us to decorate our camps with items like FO4.
---
be level 15 and server jump the vendor in Watoga
---
usually takes 5-10 jumps max
---
Omw!
---
76 need a social hub, there’s definitely precedent for it.
---
You’re methods however sounds needlessly complicated for strong stable MMO HUB let alone the gittery bit duplicating Whitespring Resort.
---
Guest Lists for Matchmaking or Party Halls would be far more efficient.
---
Could imagine one where you can drop keys in a bowl ya know lol
---
Sounds like you are unwilling to admit you were fucking wrong and instead want to try to come to an internet forum and rally a coalition to browbeat a game developer into changing their game to fit your hypothesis instead of accepting that you were just fucking wrong about something.
---
So we're going to play a game of relativism huh?
---
Obviously no engine is perfect in of itself, nor are they even perfect for a given type of game.
---
You're telling me Creation Engine is best in class for open world RPGs?
---
Bear in mind Todd Howard highlights the benefits of Creation Engine in an article that talked about the continuation of Creation Engine with Starfield and Elder Scrolls 6. None of the benefits raised has to do with quality. It was all about speed and ease of use.
---
Then how will Bethesda get all that Atom money? aka not going to happen any time soon sadly.
---
it does work, the code is randomly generated when u place the wall tho you cant choose it and the power box on the other side is bugged so u need to set a pressure plate or something directly to the door itself to open it from the inside.
---
Oh No! I hit a nerve.
---
I added you

Fucking hate toxic fucks like that. My crew will always roll up on wanted people, but usually try to talk it out first and if they people want to cooperate we clear the bounty and watch their junk. If they try to run or resist their loot is free game.
---
They have said we are getting private servers and modding in game content.
---
But you need to consider this is an online service thats point is to make profit from the atom store. So the most likely outcome to this is creation club.
---
Where mods can be made and submitted to the creation club. Similar to how artists make stuff in Warframe for players to use.
---
Where mods will be checked and tested and if all goes well are accepted into the creation club. Where the modder gets a small % of the value of atoms spent on it.
---
Just my thoughts on it considering i doubt they will allow free modding into the game that could hury their microtransactions and profits.
---
I know its not what people want to hear but its a very likely way of it been done.
---
So you didn't get it XD Alrighty then, XD-licker.
---
That's what jet pack is for. Marsupial jump, short jet pack burst, fire, and repeat
---
It's so sad... I mean, I love collect all robot models and I was glad to find them in FO76 but they are only materials to build camps
---
I started back in 1998 right after T2A launched lol
---
Me too buddy i hope they let us do it as i love decorating my camp (settlements).
---
You are trying to apply real world logic to a video game.
---
&gt;It can definitely be both cause it is merely cosmetic grants you no in game bonuses and you can be jealous over it.
---
So it has no in-game value (mechanical) but it has in-game value (social).
---
So, I ask again, which is it Schrodinger?
---
Never said it was the best in class for Open World RPGs, thats you putting words in my mouth. I have merely stated that the issues of the engine do not warrant a complete rewrite, financially or time wise. 
---
But if it were to come down to a choice between one of the freely available engines and Creation, then Creation every time, it is catered for Open World, and the dev team know it in and out.
---
That's just the queen. The more people that fight her, the higher the buff. 
---
I prefer melee because most weapons use ammo and then you have to hunt for ammo where melee the weapons rarely break and no ammo so you find yourself getting surplus, now the way i put my build is went 15 strength and 12 agility and perked into pistol damage and really didnt even need 12 agility since action boy/ girl does not work in power armor. I like the build since if i want to be i can just sneak vats a dungeon with my silenced pipe revolver.
---
Naw.  Tbh the biggest draw back to opting in to PVP is the slap damage. 
---
You cant prepare because while they can get first hit on you because you're wanted and you cant defend yourself until they damage you first and usually at that point your dead or just about to be.
---
Stealth doesnt matter since you cant damage them. 
---
There are some cool features about being wanted, like the not seeing others on the map, but if you're red, imo, it should flag anyone coming after you.
---
Like rogues in the division, people can easily avoid the big red circle and you cant really grief with it since you cant see anyone on the map.  
---
Getting a bounty is just lame. 
---
It should work more like capping a workshop, imo.
---
A Just Cause fan I assume....
---
Or just remove the damage restrictions on it for wanted players and all the sudden I have a reason to play this game again.
---
Without Balance, everything that isn't "S tier" get invalidated, and the work put in to creating them is for naught, so why bother at all with variety?  If you don't understand that, then you are suffering a massive dis-connect, and thats on you.
---
Not Empathy cause that sucks.
---
Don't fill my head with amazing ideas!, now this is all i want...
---
With level 3 class freak, most mutations are worth it.
---
Hey, I too enjoyed settlement building in fo4 (my red rocket one in particular was glorious), and I have to say fo76 is a bit of a disappointment in this regard. I mean the mechanics aren't as smooth as fo4 and you can't decorate with knock knacks and trophies (like the awesome house shaped teapot I found at Pricketts fort) which, while understandable from a game.e design perspective, is never the less disappointing. But without doubt, in my humble opinion, not being able to scrap, or at least clear out, junk lying around your camp site is very disappointing and takes from the RP element of the game
---
Such a clever young man to repeat himself over and over! 
---
[pinches his cheek]
---
Would the young little man like some new insults? Would he?
---
I live the game but if settlements is your main thing you won't be as satisfied as FO4 with it. 
---
It's fun and you can do some cool stuff but it's much smaller than FO4.  
---
You would probably enjoy the challenge of what you can do at different locations. You wouldn't be able to build something huge like Sanctuary though. 
---
The tryhard poopsockers aren't the only people playing the game. If they need easy-mode to feel like the big boys on the playground, that's their problem.
---
They are going to nerf explosive weapons soon.
---
Sorry for the inconvenience, but as others have said, it's part of the game.. in the sense that mechanics and bounty systems exist and run parallel with "base raiders". It is senseless though, as there is nothing gained from destroying someones base.
---
Having said that, it belonging to your grandmother is irrelevant. There's nothing in game to say "hey base destroyers, this is JamBear's granny's base, please reconsider". I'm sure if there was a way to convey this they would be considerate and avoid doing it... But alas there isn't.
---
Besides, one day Granny will be lvl100+ and leading a squad of OAP raiders razing others bases down to ash with their legendary 3 star Walking Canes
---
If you’re main reason for buying 76 is simply to build up settlements/camps, then I wouldn’t bother, at least not yet. You cannot build anything which even comes close to rivalling even the most basic of FO4 settlements. 
---
FO4 spawned a number of YouTube channels, for example norespawns, darth xion, ranger dave/evilviking, which pushed settlement building above and beyond anything thought possible at the release of FO4. These kinds of builders have probably inspired yourself if you have been so engaged yourself. 
---
Look at what is now being created on 76! Single foundation monstrosities which shatter all sense of immersion. Box structures which look mass produced. 
---
Floating platforms, supported by a ladder. 
---
Don’t get me wrong, I actually love 76 and spend and have spent countless hours simply exploring, but the settlement building concept has simply not translated to online play. 
---
A paid monthly subscription for the license to host the server?
---
Thanks. You can keep licking the XDs because that's what you're good at :)))
---
Just be aware of current bugs with Perkcards like Barbarian or Evasive or so. Even with Classfreak equipped, most Mutations like that pesky Herd Mentality (Hate it as a solo player) or others that fiddle with Strength WILL grant you absolutely nothing. 
---
I hope that fix this idiotic bug ASAP.
---
Gollum was once a normal hobbit.
---
The Wendigo is a Vengeful Spirit (not ghost) of the Forest.
---
Yeah. It's like, what's the point of all the bears if there is you can't make a collection?
---
Except when they can ruin other peoples enjoyment, then it becomes everyones problem
---
Fun is not useless
---
It's not really settlements its a small version vis C.A.M.P.
---
We can make amazing buildings still but you give up defense. I have a small settlement esk style camp but its nothing like we could do in FO4 yet.
---
I say yet because i think once they get the servers stable i could see them giving us more room to build into settlements ( i hope).
---
If you love FO4 you will love this game anyway. Plus most places have it very cheap so its definitely worth the pick up to see for yourself. :)
---
Careful, if you repeat yourself too much people might start to think you're not as cleaver as you think you are.
---
I was playing the game all legit and some dupers who were up to no good starting showing up around my neighborhood so me and my buddy went on the assault mode ultra. The dupers were so scared they pee-d their pants omega-lul and then IRL the duper's wife was so embarrassed for the duper she hoped on the mic and said "wow my husband is a low-life duper i want to give you and your buddy sex, i said m'mam we don't charge for sex but we do fight crime. 
---
The duper was soon arrested by the federal police because his wife who is pregnant by me and my buddy ratted him out, he now awaits death-row. 
---
I thought my TSE shotgun was strong lol 2 million damage no wonder they can pop us in pacifist mode. I really wish they would cap slap damage to 1 damage.
---
My password used to be the same for everything, and was not a very secure password on top of that. Then some asshat hacked my email AND my Steam account (thank god I was smart enough to have a different password for my bank account at the time). Now my passwords are all different strings at varying lengths of random numbers, letters and (when sites allow it) symbols on top of any 2FA options. It's a hassle when stuff happens like 76 requiring me to log in in-game even when I'm signed into the launcher, but it's worth knowing my accounts should be pretty safe.
---
smash that block button fam
---
Launch your grapple hook at a super mutant like scorpion from mortal combat, pull it in.... Whack! Sledge hammer to the face lol
---
I can craft ultracite gatling lasers I want in on the gravy train.
---
While you have a point, I fail to see what this has to do with the game needing 2FA. Also, lets just make the Bethesda Launcher itself require it btw
---
Love PvP 
---
Absolutely within the bowels of my soul despise, one shot meta.
---
Like how is this fucking fun for them?. Do you see Bethesda no actions or words on your part with just how open they are willing to brag about it...
---
There's many ways Bethesda can monetize it.  
---
1. A paid monthly license to host the server.
---
In Arma 2 DayZ. Server hosts made money from kinda "pay to win".  
---
Like when you die and spawn in as a freshie, you have literally nothing which is really annoying because zombies are a nusance when you're trying to salvage for your first weapon.  
---
2. If you paid a monthly subscription to the host, you instead spawn with a suppressed weapon. Strong enough to kill zombies but not strong enough to be effective against players. Bethesda can take a cut from these subs.  
---
3. Also bases. In DayZ, if your base gets destroyed, its gone for good. But if you pay a sub to the host, your base can be hardwired into the server so it reappeared on server restart. Bethesda can also take a cut from these subs.
---
I’m a dimensional control specialist, I use scanners to make 3D renders of structures and model them in CAD to make sure that they are built within tolerance. Or for clash detection purposes prior to installation. 
---
Same, silenced 2 * lever action with hardened receiver, crippling and ignoring 50% armour is my weapon. With tormentor and bloody mess maxed out, even if I fail to land a headshot (I use vats only for fast moving or small targets), nothing gets near enough to see me. 
---
Wouldn't mind to get my hands on a fancy TSE handmade tho, for the moments when you just want to go all in and open the gates of hell (talking to you fu*** who destroyed my camp while I was out)
---
Exactly
---
I think what makes me the maddest is that it was a camp in the middle of no where above Vault76. Just off of a road in the woods. She is about level 35 with not much “fancy” (strong/powerful) gear yet. She loves COD as well and plays a ton of Destiny! Lol she whoops butt! 
---
I think it honestly was just 2 mean guys that wanted to ruin a lower levels camp. 
---
Not sure i like the idea of any form of sub system but atleast its another way of looking at it i guess.
---
I like the stealth sniper style. Any good build to share?
---
Why not?
---
Think of the camps in 76 as single person houses that you can build and deck out vs. the full, city-like settlements you could build in 4.
---
I loved building huge settlements in 4, but honestly, without settlers to come in, there’s really no reason to build anything large in 76. A big build feels hollow and empty. 
---
Was about LVL 16 or so and started to clear a location, lotsa higher level scorched/ghouls. Someone in the excavator power armor LVL 43, was there too. I said hi and didn't think much of it. Slowly started to realise that this legend was helping me as I was getting my arse kicked. After all was said and done we went outside to chill and this person starts shooting the ground in front of them. Sillye, didn't realise for ages that they had dropped something cos it was so dark. They had dropped me a LVL 20 incendiary legendary 10mm submachine gun. So nice! I said thanks and they ran off into the night. Be nice to NOOBS! Know I will... 
---
I understand where you are coming from, its just embarrassing for games like Witcher 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2 are being created on a similar scale to Bethesda games yet they look 1000 times better.
---
I fucking HATE security questions. Most of them don't even pertain to me. I don't HAVE a spouse or children. How the hell am I supposed to remember the name of the teacher I had in kindergarten? Even the "favorite" questions you mentioned are stupid because, as you said, they change over time.
---
Figure it oot.
---
So your suggestion to the already castrated slap damage PVP &amp; pacifist mode is to further completely disable it?
---
I've noticed this to happen more often when dropping something that has a empty bottom/underneath. Such as the wooden foundations... Everytime I've dropped something on solid ground, i personally never had anything disappear
---
I have not been signed out of Steam and forced to use 2FA ever. I have my phone next to me at literally all times, so it's not really a hassle to just glance at it and confirm. Got hacked twice before I started using it, haven't since.
---
In fo76 they are cannibals that turned feral.
---
I actually had this happen to me when I started a new character to get trophies I missed during the beta. Albeit not from you. It was a cool experience to see someone who was obviously on this Reddit during reclamation day continue to help new wasteland dwellers even if they didn't realize that my char was a low level alt. Goes to show we have a lot of genuine and wonderful people in this community.
---
uh... you should ALWAYS worry about security. and where is this number you're pulling coming from?
---
It isn't really "settlement" building, it's camp building. 
---
Some differences:
---
* Smaller budget and radius
---
* Furniture must be unlocked by finding "plans" out in the wasteland
---
* Loose deco cannot be placed in your camp because junk items appear as brown paper bags when they are dropped
---
* No settlers
---
* You can only have one camp
---
Start the downvoting. No one gives a fucking shit about costumes. Perhaps fortnight might be a better choice, if you want to dress up like a loser. Play the game... kill some ghouls. Fight a scorch beast or two. Makes absolutely no difference what you look like.....
---
Happy 2019!!!!
---
Getting disconnected is part of the experience.....duh!!!
---
Haha noob
---
I don't know about others, but I've been CTDing like crazy since the last update. Pretty useful for that, but yeah it seems like when I get booted it's typically the whole server going blammo. 
---
Thanks for the help everyone. Will look again later when im on.
---
In the Mythos of the Wendigo that is also true.  A violent spirit posses someone giving them a cannibal hunger.  Symbolic of murder and such.  But the point is they are no longer human.
---
In this case gone feral like ghouls so them talking or retaining speech would be odd.  Then they’d pretty much be scorched 
---
Oh man, THAT bug. I don't knwo what was up with it but I took the whoel stack since I needed a key and I didn't know which one it was. Now I have 20-ish copies of teh same key and can't drop any. They don't weigh anything luckily but, oof. My misc is all cluttered up.
---
I get what your saying, but the distinction is that it was in "their" area. That's what makes the difference. Now you know not to pick safes (or doors) in another player's claimed area. 
---
The more you know 
---
Please tell me thats not another quest, im done with wendigos
---
I've got a few max level characters.
---
One time I was about level 15 or so (before learning how to powerlevel) I had a level 100+ person come up to me and dropped a bag which contained crafting materials like springs and adhesive along with some plans. It took me a little bit to find and plug in my headset and he was emoting like crazy trying to get me to pick it up. Once my headset was on I told him this was an alt character and I had a few high level characters already and I disnt want his stuff and to give it to someone else. They actually got upset about it because I wouldnt take it.
---
Me personally I dont go out of my way to find people to give stuff to. If I run out of vendors to sell to I just launch a nuke do the nuke (usually overencombered) and drop everything at the closest train station. Someone usually picks it up.
---
Good luck getting any randoms to accept your friend invites, when even during nuke runs it's hard to get them to team up.
---
Regardless of whether anything was wasted or not,  Bethesda seriously, fix the disconnects already. Please :)
---
Look it up.  Like most mythological creatures there are several versions and then modern media puts twists on it too.
---
There's an Agility Perk that makes enemies lose sight of you when you crouch. If the enemy has a direct line of sight to you and you crouch, you will briefly change from [Danger] to [Caution] which is enough time to fire a shot. You can do this as many times in a row as you see fit. 
---
For my Unarmed Power-armorless character, I just spam sneak punches until my target is dead.
---
I used to try to read them too. Nowadays i just Skip them Letters and hope for a quest or s.t
---
This lol regardless of anything else we need server stability.
---
Right? I want to world build here. That revenge. Near top of the world this super mutant hook shotted a grenade at me and I want revenge 
---
Do note: Bird Bones breaks this glitch.
---
 Escape Artist Perk: Sneak to lose enemies, and running no longer affects stealth. 
---
Yeah it may work there but on PC you can only join a friends game.
---
Counter point: enough people do to warrant a cosmetic shop.
---
I'll also give you another hint: I'm not actually mad, this was a joke/save your atoms if this was why you were going to buy them like me.
---
That's completely fine if you don't feel the need for cosmetics though! See you out in the wasteland! 
---
Also how DARE you suggest I go play fortnite? I really am shook about that (again, not really)
---
...and to bring the point back full-circle:
---
&gt;Could they fix all these issues and bring the engine up to even just being on par with current industry gold standard engines? Maybe.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Judging by how they implemented multiplayer and online in Fallout 76, I'm not confident that Bethesda will put in the time and effort or perhaps even have the competency to do so.
---
My premise is that there are definite and significant problems with the engine, not as you said "there is nothing at all wrong with the engine itself". 
---
Switching engines isn't a panacea. In fact, it'd probably be worse initially due to having to learn the engine and adapt systems to it. In the long term though, with a more mature and fully developed engine suited to open world RPGs... My money is not on them doing a better job with their existing engine to raise the quality of the final product.
---
It's all a moot point anyhow. They seem like they have no intention of changing. Maybe ever. It'd need a significant management change or company buyout for there even to be a chance for a shift in engine.
---
I'm only saying it's not cool to call all people who pvp in a game "idiots," just because they do it, regardless of mechanics. 
---
But happy to share my own experience in response of some of the points you bring up.
---
&gt; What chance does a level 30 have against a level 100 running full Assasin gear with a gun that does over 2x the damage? 
---
First of all you don't enocunter a lot of people running such a build. It can happen, and as a lvl 30 vs a lvl 100 it makes it very hard to win, which makes sense. It's nice that more investments in your character can lead to an advantage. I started a new character and regularly kill people 70 - 100 lvls above me. Every fight is different because every player is different and theres a lot of things you can do wrong or right in this game. If you have a black powder weapon and nuka grenades, drugs, decent damage increasing perks, and most of all, have a plan, you can win almost every fight. At least that's my experience. Also cause the terrain can be very diverse. In many parts of the map, like open places, you don't stand a chance against very high lvl's, but in other parts you do. The pvp is far from perfect, but it can be fun and rewarding.
---
&gt; And remember the other players are also Vault 76 members, people we've  spent around 25 years with. Suddenly they are all hell bent on killing  each other when the marketed aim of the game is starting to rebuild? 
---
It is not uncommon for humans to turn on each other for profit or glory. And there's trolls ofc.
---
&gt; Some forms of PvP in the game are great, some are just absolutely  fucking stupid as shit. Worse than ARK, Rust, DayZ and a bunch of other  titles. And the fact you can accidentally trigger PvP even if you opt  for PVE is even more stupid as others have said previous games in the  series let you know you're doing something naughty. This one goes "fine,  fine, fine, YOU FUCKING CRIMINAL!" with zero indication it is about to  happen. 
---
I don't know this games, but I agree with you there. I've played pvp in Arma, Battlefield and eve online. FO76 developpers stated they need a lot of time and effort to tune their first multiplayer fallout attempt. I'm still positive it will all improve.
---
I had crashes first few times when I started to see the radiation area. But then it stopped, no idea how. Maybe try to do repair.
---
Lmao. Sometimes OP is tarded.
---
I hurt my neck shaking my head in disgust, it's too late
---
how do you get the ballistic damage of a chainsaw over 1?
---
does repairing over 100% increase damage on melee weapons? because that doesn't work on ballistic weapons
---
This man passes go
---
Well that’s not very helpful. Hopefully they will fix that for you but please don’t hold your breath as it could prove detrimental to your health given the current response time from them. 
---
Getting insta-killed at any range by an explosive two-shot weapon is not fun

Thd fuck is your post even contributing to his thread. Are you so desperatelly lonely that you purposly give shit replies that don't mean anything to random posts? Guys like you fascinate me, i'm really curious of your dsily life routine to write useless comments like that.
---
&gt;	because I’m tired of paying the repeated overhead in resources
---
For what it’s worth, my character without Contractor gives up and basically just makes turrets instead of resource stations and thinks of workshops as event spawns with a stash and cheap fast travel, but my character with Contractor 2 (and Home Defense 3 if that matters, since so many fewer turrets are needed if they’re missile turrets) goes from green to white in a few places but that’s after placing all the resource stations and more resources are made than spent such that it’s not really an issue.
---
I guess Contractor 2 characters would be the universal doner (O-) and Contractor 0 characters would be the universal receiver (AB+), since the former wouldn’t want to inherit a workshop from anyone that made weaker (or just different) choices when converting empty workshops to full workshops is cheap enough for them, while Contractor 0 characters would appreciate any full workshop that the doner possibly sacrificed to create.
---
I guess it’s worth sending team requests, but don’t be surprised if they’re refused.  I don’t accept random team invites because I can’t be bothered to figure out what probably-not-for-my-sake reason they’re being made.  Maybe someone wants to teleport to my location to save travel costs.  Maybe someone wants to teleport to my location and kill me.  Maybe they want to talk for hours about GoBots and berate me if I refuse.  I won’t know until they arrive.  Similarly, in real life I let all unknown number phone calls go to voice mail, and I assume I’ve lost opportunities to marry fake Nigerian princesses (or GoBots) as a result.  In game (PC version), though, since we don’t have text chat or mailboxes, I guess for now I’ll just have to not find out what opportunities I missed.

Tell her to try to the East of WV lumber.  High up there's a couple of abandoned camps.  One near the cliff edge above a ruined house.  The other in a bit of a cutting. To either side there's Steel and Oil that can be mined if you are into that.  I have a cool view, can tell if someone is naughty not nice, as it's so far off the track.  
---
When I first started Xbox the Engineers that worked for me, wanted to kick the bosses ass.  After 2 weeks playing Halo in ranked, they wouldn't play with me much as I kept killing them.  By COD Modern Warfare, I'd take them all on 1 v in private matches.  After that they stopped playing altogether. Lol I love Xbox.
---
Move your little CAMP box, you spawn related to it's position in the green area. You can move the box in build mode, it doesn't move the location of your actual camp. 
---
Is anyone else having consistent crashes on the stash??
---
May Atom prevent that. I think it's time we all make a very realistic request like asking my multiplayer game to be single player.
---
Been playing since early 90`s and fo 76 is by far the best game so far( yes i know the flaws and hopefully more content coming) 
---
Did I harsh your vibe, bro?
---
You don't matter enough to deserve my attention.
---
Planters would be nice, but also being able to simply light or not light the campfire would be nice also. I'd like to be able to just place dirt wherever it's needed.
---
Did you chop off your arm and chance it with someone? Your hand may not be general anymore 
---
You get xp, plans and 25 caps for claiming it. 
---
I see what you did there.
---
At work right now so I don't know my exact build but focus on Rifleman/Expert/Master + Tank Killer + Bloody Mess + Gunsmith + Sneak + Escape artist + Covert Operations 
---
I have the exact same problem! tried all the silos in 3 different worlds. Aswell as "Scan &amp; repair" the game. It's a no go.

Wake up. You're in a simulation

Valkyr Prime approves of adding riplines to FO76
---
Some say its bugged and some say its for new years. We dont know 100% ithet way as many of asked them this question via twitter , here and forums with no response.
---
Hopefully tomorrow we can and its all back to normal.
---
Uhhh does the south automatically lose?
---
Ok will do
---
Just make PvE servers and PvP servers. This solves all the issues imo.  If you want to deal with the broken pvp in this game you can, people who love PvE can have there cake as well.
---
That'd be a micro-megasloth
---
Then kill them before they can kill you. 
---
You will have to remake the thread they will knock it for the title. You have brought something up that needs to be seen by all.
---
So people know how some are getting past the pacfist bit and one shotting everyone.

Regardless of pacifist mode as well. 
---
Players still do fight initiation damage but you aren't allowed to hit them back, so what is the point of enabling it? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Some say its bugged and some say its for new year...

Obviously any political connotations to either side wouldn’t even be considered. This is for the sake of military history and the remembrance of those who gave their lives in the name of honor, duty, and courage.
---
But military history says they lose.
---
You will outlevel it quickly, just use what you pick up until you reach the level cap.
---
I like pvp, but it needs balancing big time. I'd like to see sneak, melee, and  explosives nerfed, plus overall damage reduced by 5 or 10 times. That allow players to actually engage each other instead of it coming down to a single shot.
---
Thank you! I will let her know about them. 😊 
---
Lol you sound awesome! Keep kicking butt! 
---
She plays PS4 every day for hours lol she really loves her video games. 
---
me and my mate have it together its awesome, but if we are not together we are fuked
---
I need a jetpack for xbox 
---
They are down for some reason for everyone.
---
When the game first came out, I dropped about 20 Bobby pins for a friend to pick up. We were on a flat surface outside so no grass or anything blocking the view but we couldn't find those pins and looked for a good 5 minutes. (should have taken 5 seconds to find the bag where we were looking.)
---
That being said it hasn't happened for a wile. 
---
There just isn't any kind of end game. It is a single player game with 23 other people that has a "unique" way of delivering quests. It is a VERY easy game so as to be accessible to as many people as possible and designed with time gates to keep those people logging in to grind. Once you get passed those gates it becomes clear that there is nothing else there. IMO the game really does exist to support the Atomic Shop, not the other way around. 
---
I've resigned myself to just thinking of it like that, a mediocre, MTX, single player game that I've finished. It really isn't an MMO and there isn't anything to keep you playing after maxing out your character and maxing out is too easy to do.
---
Problem is this guy ruins your game when he's in it his GT should be known . I'm leaving it up until it's deleted then I will do another honestly he's the utter worst you can imagine
---
You just need to put the tosser in your blocklist
---
Him and his 5 other mates
---
Actually no. Bionic Commando. :D
---
Don't get snippy with me!
---
Ok ok all Jokes aside for a moment.  You do see how dying honorably with courage because it’s your duty is a political connotation?
---
Mods ignore the the light/ Sturdy/ Heavy prefix.
---
So, example, for Leather, just keep building and scraping Light Arm mods and you will eventually get all the mods that are unlockable.
---
(Scraping arm pieces can unlock legs/Torso mods etc)
---
what am i looking at here?
---
I didn't intend my hope of developers prioritizing stability issues rather than Marsupial update to be an argument, merely a wish.
---
YES it will do and a site note, that i had to learn the hard way, i doesnt matter WHAT part u scrapped it will random unlock a Mod for every part of armor possible!
---
We have 3 Armor Parts: Body, Arms, Legs! So u have the Scrap a ton to unlock for example the Polymer Mod 3Times!!! for all Parts!
---
The best way to unlock these mods is to have a lot mats for crafting LIGHT LVL1 ARMS (lowest mats needed i believe) Armorer Perk would decrease the needed mats and Super Duper would give a up to 30% chance to get a second part for only ONE craft... craft much as possible, scrap them at ONCE (if possible some items stack, some u have to scrap one by one, safe your non legendary equipped armor parts or u may scrap them too \*happend to me XD\*)
---
All mods u unlock will be aviable at every armor class, normal/sturdy/heavy, have fun crafting ;) u will need a loooooot mats to unlock them all (i needed for my leather parts hundreds and with armorer+super duper u can craft them nearly lost free of mats cause they are extremly cheap and give all mats back after scrapping, only 1 steel is lost and super duper reduce the lost very nicely)
---
Hope i could help u and sry for my bad english \^\^
---
Greetings from germany :o) happy new year
---
Very good! The South did lose the Civil War! However there are limitations to how a battle can play out in a video game set in a post apocalyptic wasteland, and this is on a battle scale, not a war scale. It’s more of an actual battle between two sides than a full on historical re-enactment. However that is something to think about. In the real life Battle of Philippi, the Union had won. If one were to want a more historically-accurate battle, that could be arranged.
---
And slavery, please don’t marginalize the fact that a revolution was fought over the right to own other people.
---
Or a skelly... or a ghoul.. frankly it should have half a dozen or more variants with things strapped in!
---
I just assumed that my character is insane that that the "overseer" isn't a real person but just a figment of a delusional mind. 
---
Allowing a Wanted Player be able to attack any other player would open the doors for grief. 
---
What could stop said 2SE Gauss Rifle user gaining a small wanted level of 10 caps then roaming the map one shorting everyone they come across because "it wasn't fair" that they couldn't attack first. 
---
The idea of wanted is punishment. Giving them free powers of pvp would be terrible. 
---
Not in enough of a sense to cause issues. I obviously wouldn’t have people getting worked up over slavery on it. It would be strictly in a re-enactment setting.
---
We should make this with a mod in the corner of the FO4 map and upload it to YouTube to fuck with people.
---
I had something like this happen the other day on PC. I have three frames with assorted t45  and t60 pieces (can't wear any of it though; lvl 21). Had placed two frames to consolidate some of the pieces to just one frame, and placed a the third out on my balcony (definitely placed it). Watched bemused as it fell through the balcony. Ran down to see if it was on the ground below it, but no, gone. No big deal for me, but it was high level stuff that would be a pain to replace? Yeah, I'd be pissed.
---
Use mods, didn’t get banned.  Don’t use cheat engine, didn’t get banned.  It’s not mods that are getting people banned.
---
Don't know about awesome but nobody thinks I am 60.  Don't sound it don't play like it.  I stopped looked for Gamerpoints a long time ago, so spending the time in PvP I think has kept me sharp.  Killing bots is easy, humans and are so tricky, much more fun.  But not in F76, think it spoils the game.  Should be co-op I think, keep PvP for other games that suit the majority fan base.  Hope she finds a nice spot.
---
Umm ok. Good luck with that!
---
Small tip since you were gifted Excavator. If you haven't gotten or finished Miner Miracles yet, check the marked terminal first for the Excavator Plans before you register your Excavator Set at Garrahan. If you complete the mission with your gifted set, you'll never get the Excavator plans and can never build your own Leveled set.
---
Maybe we have now launched enough nukes and Scorchbeasts are surrending. New DLC??
---
This is the power of the consumer.....
---
Happy new year, you are not allowed to play with fireworks
---
Take a look here
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aa3n8x/we_are_creating_a_where_do_i_get_that_list_of_all/
---
Molotov enemies in the ground, it works.
---
You dont. I'm pretty sure its just referring to the already existing photoframes that you get when visiting locations. The new year one is in the atomic shop for an insane price 
---
You're gonna need to get much more specific than that. First which plans are you looking for. Are you looking for their locations in game or do you want to buy them? Next your system. Then what you're willing to pay. Given the lack of this info I'm going to guess you're new. In that case don't really worry about making all sorts of guns because you're going to be getting a took on your way up to 50.
---
I've found there are three primary sources for plans:  
---
(1)  Vendors, especially in Watoga and Harper's Ferry for more rare plans (e.g., Handmade).  
---
(2)  Patrol Duty, which is a daily that happens in the Eastern Regional Penitentiary.  
---
(3)  Spawns in the wild, which could be in nearly any container or on tables.  
---
If you are looking for something in particular and for your game on a particular platform, then you can check the reedit trade threads and make a trade deal with another player.
---
Maybe since we nuked whitesprings so much we gonna get a new spot in map, scorchbeast haven't gotten hit as hard as whitesprings 
---
Ethanol
---
Sceptical. They could be a duper.
---
It really depends on what you drop. A couple of 100% fusion cores? Nice! A modded suit of armour that is at my level? Awesome! Anything that's too legendary or above my level, no thank you.
---
I usually drop a few plans, some chems and some carry weight-helping food. Stuff that'd be useful even though it takes up precious inventory space.
---
I can see why you went there but I’m actually talking about exactly what you said.  Honor.  Duty.  Courage.
---
War never Changes.  These tenants have been around for what, a millennia now?  Fallout is a giant political connotation about the violence of humans, escalation and our inevitable demise at our own hands.
---
So bring it on.  My they lose really was just a joke.
---
Yes pls!
---
Again, wouldn’t have much political connotations. Won’t have team leaders give a speech about what they’re fighting for before the battle. It’s strictly in a re-enactment sense. I’ve been to countless re-enactments and it’s completely focused around uniformity, weaponry, and remembrance of lives lost. Lest we forget, to quote the common phrase used towards veterans of the First World War.
---
Stop duping dude
---
Much like Skyrim and FO4, 76 is fairly cpu-focused but does a terrible job of offloading work beyond two threads (ie, two of the hyperthreaded cores, which it sees as discrete cpus, not the physical cores themselves). I’m running an overclocked i7-6850k and a 1080ti, but the game only uses two of the available 12 threads. I’ve had mixed results with forcing it to use more than two threads.
---
Still, 70fps and lower is weird for a 2080; I’m seeing close to a steady 100fps ultra everything at 3440x1440. Are you playing in 4K?
---
Other post you made was more whine.  Also, no one believes this is real or us proof it can happen.  You did something.
---
NOT TRUE
---
it will randomly unlock a mod for body or arms or legs !!!
---
example: u scrap 10 arms and unlock polymer, u go with the 11th arm and still have no polymer mod avaible cause it was unlocked for legs or body (happend to me and found only out with help here on reddit!)
---
Anything in particular?
---
I’m not?
---
I'm level 76 and some people still drop items for me. I don't meed most of it with the exception of steel and lead. Also got a few legendary items from others but most of them are not really usable to me.
---
Wish I had done this beforehand. I launched a nuke, game seemed to stall after doing some runs, rejoined through some random 'recent player' in the game. Then game crashed as I re-entered and when restarting the game the entire recent players list was wiped.
---
It seems not all names are good for rejoining, because some are marked as 'offline', the fake offline because you can see them in the damn game. But because it's offline you can't join them. 
---
So make sure the names you take down are joinable as well.
---
My problem is stored items that I can't get rid of...
---
Damn, you really started New year's off still mad about this post. This is my last reply because you obviously don't read what you write. While you are probably right and I am some archetype of asshole, you win the brown star in this thread. Stay proud soldier, see you in appalacia.
---
&gt;Someone tell me the last time Bethesda truly released a game without tons of issues at launch.
---
Fallout 4. Even the unofficial patch is small.
---
BGS has been, up until recently, a relatively small dev team making *huge* fuckin games.
---
In the last couple of years, BGS has roughly quadrupled in size, and it's *still* a small dev team compared to other AAA developers.
---
Fallout 4 was built by just over 100 people.
---
You sure?
---
Positive bud
---
You stand no chance. Accept us or perish.
---
That bomber jacket doesn't exist bro.
---
Ah, I see! Thank you for the quick reply! :)
---
Prawn suit
---
You could try to throw your whole inventory away
---
You might find it frustrating if you're just in it for the building and less about all the other gameplay elements.
---
The thing that'll sting you the most is getting access to plans to build certain things e.g. brick walls or garage doors and such.
---
If you don't mind building up your plans and resources over time, it can be rewarding. Particularly if you like to play host as well by building a rest stop style camp.
---
Otherwise, I might pass until there's more in the game to do with camps and maybe they allow for larger camp budgets to build with.
---
Sounds like...COMMUNISM! 
---
Do you have any worthwhile suggestions or are you just here to make stupid comments and accuse people of duping?
---
There are still some issues with the trophies/achievement.
---
I've reached level 100 twice with 2 non-beat characters and still haven't had the 'Fallout Forever' trophy unlock.
---
Doesn't mean it's manually put it. Just means whatever randomization setup they have hickuped, likely because of the new year. 
---
Another "I got Trade Robbed" but I didn't decide to gain any proof through short clip recordings. No proof didn't happen. 
---
User Error! Stop spreading this crap!
---
I understand. Sorry for getting worked up over a joke, hard to tell over text.
---
I usually like to steal their ammo all the time but this is much better
---
Sooo.... wait until at least the end of the year?
---
They introduced new bugs with the last update, mine crashes now on Xb1 when I try scrapping weapons, pretty much can duplicate it .. it never used to crash before, was just slow, but now my game freeze when I scroll too fast down the weapon list. Try go very slowly, what happens if you loot the first weapon ?
---
I would be very interested in that too
---
I somehow remember that she let us out 5 years after the original date so she could scout around
---
The first weapon may go through but regardless of how quick I try to pick up these weapons within 1-3 the game freezes and blasts my ear with the disconnect noise and then I’m back at the dashboard 
---
It's not even that when you request an item you only "request" you can't set a price. So you can't even trick them into a lower price. 
---
OP dropped weapon either by accident or the whole situation was a poor attempt to convince people it's real. 
---
But we need to forget.  I live in he south as well and listen to people constantly talk about the heritage and blah blah bullshit.  It was a war fought over the right to own other people.  Not a war over taxes but a war over something morally reprehensible.   By trying to honor these people you are legitimizing what they fought for.  
---
You can’t separate the war from those that fought it.  I know the guys on the field weren’t slave owners but they fought them.  I know in WW2 not all nazis killed Jews but they are still nazis.  It’s the same bullshit argument about the statues, it’s heritage not hate blah blah bullshit.  It’s oppression and has no place in our world today as it glorifies and marginalized the fact that people killed each other over the right to own people.
---
There is a way to get almost 98% player damage reduction, that coupled with a dense mod should do it.
---
Dude you got a stash full of weapons and you cant get them out due to the quantity of items in your inventory its very clear that youre a duper
---
I once chased some guy across the Savage Divide and to the ends of the Toxic Waste because he trampled my mutfruits and incapacitated my turrets. I play a pacifist, and prefer to avoid PVP, but Don't. Fucking. Touch. My. Stuff. 
---
That has not been my experience. The ones I've unlocked have always been for that part. 
---
For example, I didn't have pocketed for my legs and spent ages to get it unlocked with leg parts. All the while still breaking down other parts for other mods. Got pocketed with breaking down the legs.
---
Not saying you're wrong. Just that I've never had that happened to me (or noticed it).
---
Yeah, I couldn't give a fuck what the hive mind thinks, one person says something and it snowballs in that direction. I'm not mad about this post, I was never mad about this post. I'm just telling you some facts that you can't seem to catch.
---
&gt; you obviously don't read what you write. 
---
Same friend, I find what you're saying hilarious and this time it's actually ironic.
---
The hotkey is F on pc
---
What a party pooper you are.
---
Watching someone innocently pick my purifier and the resulting smack down is one of the finer joys I am afforded in this short life. That you would take that from me is the height of selfishness.
---
Yup that's what happens to me when I try scrap weapons, new bug, never happened prior to othe last update. Happens on both my xboxes, exact same issue.
---
When I said "there is nothing at all with the engine" that was not meant as a "there is no issues/engine is perfect" but the instead that the engine is fine for what it does, issues or no. Nothing that warrants complete and total rewrite.
---
At this point I think its just safe to agree to disagree, u dont like the engine, and I dont mind it, I dont think we will be agreeing on the finer points of what constitutes a significant issue, etc.
---
\+1
---
Damn! Seems the C.A.M.P needs some serious fixing :/
---
I have the flu so I spent all night inside coughing and sweating while my friends were partying. But I also did play Fallout 76 and I don't have an SO so I guess I fit the criteria.
---
If I was a duper I wouldn’t be able to fit the items in my stash and I’d be heavily encumbered, have you heard of the trade subs? Do you know about Xbox LFG or PlayStation LFG and their roll in trading? Are you aware of buying low and selling high through different mediums?
---
No of course not, if someone is set better than you in the game they must be cheating? Get out of here scrub 
---
I’m on Xbox, I decided 95 levels in I wanted to restart. I’ve got a two shot explosive and I’m using the Nukes Dragons character specs. I’ve been sure to include the perk where guns break 50% slower and luck of the draw.
---
I have so many things to say about this. First if you don't want your base to get destroyed, when you see that it's getting attacked and you don't want to pvp them then just log out. Most of the time that is the goal. Don't think this post will change anything. Believe me if they see if they are only going to be laughing. That's the point. Next to the "white knights" hahahahahahahahaha. You all know damn well they will do the same thing. I'm not trying to grief you here but seriously you can't expect it not to happen in an online game. If you think I'm wrong, go read up on the WoW funeral massacre.
---
Check on r/fo76bazaar normally tonnes of TSE weapons for sale as everyone only wants them these days.
---
Yeah, I got that. It isn't meant to be taken literally. I'm disagreeing with this part in particular:
---
&gt; the engine is fine for what it does, issues or no
---
Fine obviously being a subjective qualitative word. It's acceptable, tolerable but I wouldn't call it fine for what it does.
---
Not sure why the downvotes. A ‘thread of the year’ should be original content. It’s generated some amusing discussion but so did the last time it was posted. And not saying the op is ripping off at all, probably just had the same funny thought.
---
Be nice to each other etc.
---
Likely nonsense.
---
1. Everybody on that server will spawn with the same gear. It can't separate between normal players or your so called 'pay2win' players. 
---
2. Bases are getting backuped for reasons of persistence crashing. ATM everybody in DayZ  knows that basebuilding is a waste of time and not working as intended. 
---
Sorry, wanted to post that on 76 market reddit...how embarrasing
---
Has there been a server maintenance in the past week? Or are we running on stale servers at this point from like 2-3 weeks ago
---
Lmaoooo got you good duper
---
Well if we can't find one I can tell you that the large armour-piercing magazine for the combat rifle only has 25 rounds, so the small super-armour-piercing magazine (20 rounds) is probably the better option.
---
Probably.
---
Who knows.
---
Its fine not all know about the two trade subs.
---
I can buy I won't be online for about 9 hours. PSN SaintNitsu
---
Doesn't matter. I'm also curious to know what kind of weapons can't be crafted (I know that legendary can't be crafted). 
---
If your in active PVP it hides map dots to stop it being used to locate your challenger. 
---
Bethesda are known for listening. They listened to players complaints about Elder Scolls online after its launch and then proceeded to make improvements and turn it into the game it is today. 
---
Post of the year? It's a side mission in the game 
---
To -12% i think.
---
Grandma needs to up her game
---
I'm not even aiming that high. I'd be happy with just a year of Bethesda avoiding embarrassing managerial and communication blunders.
---
Yo, feel free to PM me or add me on FO76 on steam, I have been through the same thing (and I'm still in it).   
---
Not sure if fallout 76 is what you should be spending all your time on to distract you, if you 100% need something to distract you (and sometimes you do, believe me I know), try to vary your activities. Watch Netflix, read a book, go for a walk, play a game, solve a crossword.   
---
If you do the same activity too much you will be burned out on it after a while and then you have nothing to distract you anymore.  
---
I'm reachable on discord, steam and reddit if you ever need to vent or need to hear someone else's shitty situation to distract you from your own. Cheers and happy new year! (I have the flu so you probably had a better new years than me)
---
Sounds like some if the whingebags where I live.
---
Who could blame them?
---
Bizzare, I have never met a griefer since I started in beta. Are you on NA? Because I'm on EU and every single person either gives me stuff, accepts stuff from me or run away without saying anything, and every single mic user has been super friendly and cooperative (if they know english that is).
---
it is probably on the lowlowlowlow criticity list when it comes to bugs, so don't worry too much :)
---
Mayors safe. The stimpacks respawn endlessly when you server hop
---
I know.  That’s why I came clean on a separate reply.  That one can cause whatever problems or get downvoted while this one can talk about how Fallout already promotes fighting, killing commies in the line of duty so why not delve into the alternate history civil war.
---
I just hope they continue with the weekly updates after the holiday period. 
---
Anecdotal comfirmation, I've seen such thing (CAMP is full and has set of items X, CAMP is rebuild still with set of items X, is now 95% full).
---
But correlation doesn't imply causation, I've read a post about phantom budget out of scrapping power connectors without scrapping the wire, this could be confirmation aswell.
---
How is 2 million even possible?
---
was it at whitespring? down at the tenniscourt? parkingspot?
---
I did the best I could with the limitations, by no means my final form, i'm level 32 and 7 days old sheesh.
---
You misunderstand; they are a noob at killing.
---
What do you mean?
---
99% of my legendaries are trash too. For example, killed the SBQ last night and I got a stupid 2* walking cane. Killed a 3* legendary moments later in the nuke zone and got a 2* rolling pin.....
---
I think of it like playing golf where I probably hit 75-100 terrible shots per round. BUT there is that one drive where I smash it off the tee, 285 yards right down the middle of the fairway, OR that one 150yd iron shot to within 6 feet of the pin. It’s those one or two shots per round that keep me coming back to play. 
---
Hi! I bought the game yesterday and I am looking for a team. I'm a total noob but this tribe thing seems awesome so I would love to join if I'm allowed?
---
There is more than just incremental changes going in tho, just not all of them are visually noticeable immediately (and some are probably more in a transitional phase in FO76), and you will see more as the newer games come out.
---
Ohhh yes! What's your ign??
---
I’d be up for a grappling hook with lighter armor, would’ve been cool with the Enclave scout set, but having it for PA would make the jet pack a bit redundant. 
---
Speaking of which, jet pack and marsupial are very handy for getting a vantage point/safe spot when overwhelmed, but don’t get too excited about using them to check out the highest points of somewhere like Watoga; I’ve been up there and there’s no extra content, unfortunately. 
---
I am swedish and I'm currently playing a chef character atm haha. He has the chef hat and the skiing outfit, and he uses a rolling pin and pistols as weapons. There was a really funny moment when i first started playing. I met some random guys outside the wendigo event and started talking to them, very nice guys, one romanian the other dutch. I tell them i'm looking for a chef outfit and they help me hunt down the chef hat and the rolling pin.   
---
Then, the high level romanian guy wants to help me get my excavator set, so we head to garrahan mining and clear the place. I find an empty PA chassis and as I step in I say in a dramatic booming voice "I am... THE IRON CHEF", which started a 2 minute long laughing fit between all of us. Good times.
---
I don't have them, so I don't really know, but I thought they were overlays meaning they don't replace floors, the just overlay them. Did you try just snapping it to the existing floor?
---
What do YOU mean, "What does he mean"? He wants a weapon mod for explosive rounds that he can upgrade at a work bench. Not a whole perk for ex rounds.
---
Okay, I get what you mean. I agree. Maybe not all the plans then. Certain things would still needed to be grinded. But if it can be bought (it can found at Mick and Ralph's) or drops in the world then you can get it from the bounties. My original thought was for the things like 'Combat Rifle NV Scope' or ".38 hasty receiver". I wasnt even thinking about the things like the Ultracite/BoS stuff. I'm gok g to edit my OP.
---
It seems like pistols may not have as many good perks, but the trade if is that pistols work much better in vats (faster crit building, less AP per shot, etc.). So those luck perks dealing with vats/crits turn a decent .44 into a monster, one shotting most things (including players in power armor).
---
This normally if we dc its because the whole server crashed its rare for it to be one person. Its why when you try to rejoin your mates it says the world is no longer available.
---
This worked for me. I just used the Xbox menu of recent players, as opposed to the useless fallout one. 
---
Why was this thread on my Google News feed I don't even play fallout.
---
X01 right arm is something I plug ten times daily since yesterday
---
I don't know olif You noticed It, but ranged sneack Attack bonus isn't worth.
---
There are better perks to pick, like adrenaline.
---
I don't know how hard it would be to implement, but they should just add a "Junk" tab to the CAMP menu, that lets you place any non-scrap junk item in your inventory or stash. 
---
BillieBugs if you mean username. Like I said, I'm a noob  😂
---
You probably scare the big Jesus out of me first. But when i find out what ur up to, ur welcome anytime. It's a bit of a struggle right now @ lvl 27. 
---
Was excited when I first found one of these, but my ‘haha, yes!’ turned into ‘seriously?’ when I fired one to find out it had no splash damage or....damage of any sort, really. 
---
I once found what looked to be remains of three Graham caravans, and four glowing vengdigos in a single spot in the north/east corner of the map.
---
Yeah I meant username :) I'll add you now but I'll play tomorrow. My username is dinski 
---
That's what I meant.
---
Dupers stack bobbleheads of the same type on each other with all kinds of stuff to hit 2 million damage area. So you definitely can my man.
---
Thanks, if you manage to post special it could open a discussion... I put few points in STR &amp; END to get lighter equipments/ chems etc...
---
Thank you all, that was very informative! Happy new year guys!
---
I don’t see what super have to do with it but if that’s possible can I stack psycho on top of each other?
---
My bedroom. It's a tiny room with a bed that takes up most of the space. 
---
I like to lure wanderers inside, get them into that room, and leave... shutting the door behind me and telling them to take a nap.
---
Great answers, all of you. This is precisely what I was asking for :) 
---
Awesome! I look forward to playing with you! What's your discord? Shoot me a message on there when you're ready to play. Mines G0D#9320 
---
You replace the floor with the atomic store variant. 
---
Bobbleheads confirmed to stack via that post in regards to dupers. But some testing might need to be done regarding certain med types.
---
Just a heads up, it's "bejesus" not "big jesus" altough now i kinda want "big jesus" to be correct haha.
---
There's also a caps stash that spawns by the service entrance and another by the exit to the whitespring
---
Maybe this is a good time to tell gram to spec into the Home Defense perk. A few well placed laser turrets, mines and traps should help prevent this again. I hate griefers. Most likely it was little kids. I try to think of that before I get mad, because I was like them once. 
---
In the older versions of Fallout and Elder Scrolls, the pick lock thing would read in red if picking it or using something would get you in trouble.  I do wish they'd bring that back!  I did the same thing but with a toolbox at someone's workshop and also got the Wanted level.
---
That being said, if you do accidentally get a Wanted level, I recommend popping back to your CAMP, dropping off your junk, and then going somewhere on the map where other people are.  I put my mic live and ask people to kill me to get rid of the Wanted level on me.  They kill me, I respawn and then continue on with my game.
---
I see where you’re trying to come from, but there’s no good reason for anyone to forget history. You can attempt to rationalize it any way you’d like to with how they fought over the ownership of another person. It was extremely despicable and the fact that human history is littered with it is disgusting. But remembering that it happened is 100% necessary because it shows our evolution as humans. We evolve physically and have over millennia but our evolution emotionally and mentally is far more relevant today. And the fact of the matter is that slavery is still an issue in so many countries around the word today. By trying to forget that it happened here, we’re making it harder to force others to understand why it’s so wrong.
---
And deciding not to honor the 620,000 men and women who gave their lives fighting for what they believed in is despicable as well. You CAN NOT morally or ethically dismiss the sacrifices of those men and women just because you don’t want anyone to remember that slavery existed. You’re attempting to throw history away in the name of progression, when doing so is just as despicable as defending the evil side. Like it or not, just because some of those soldiers defended slavery, doesn’t mean that they wouldn’t have likely repented for thinking so at the age of 75, instead of dying at the age of 18 like so many of them did.
---
Your figure is more accurate. Last night I nuked WhiteSprings snd got 3 different 3 star items, a wood chest piece, a rolling pin, and a walking cane. *Sweet*
---
Can I stack psycho?
---
Thissss. Accidentally sitting while looting pisses me off sooo muuchhh
---
They could be used in conjunction for a jet powered super swing! Or you could grapple an enemy, blast off while carrying them, then let go to let the fall damage kill them.
---
I will get on now for a bit but I won't be able to speak. Here's a tip: do the overseer camp and responders quests to set yourself up for survival :)
---
Which is why it gets moved to the pvp radio station so that you are among people who also wish to PvP, it's a punishment that doesn't fit with the situation.
---
Gta online has a bounty system that highlights you on the map and makes you a target usually leading to constant harassment, it works though because you aren't defenseless and eventually over time you get the money for surviving the bounty.
---
Griefing I understand but at the same time open PvP is a common mechanic that many multiplayer survival games have, for instance Rust, Day Z, Ark, Conan Exiles, Unturned all have and are part of the reason why it's enjoyable.
---
All I'm saying is that you shouldn't have a mechanic that encourages PvP but doesn't allow one side to participate in. Especially that punishes a mistake without a way to forgive.
---
It does exist! I recently got one for the "Forbidden Knowledge" quest. Had about 10(ish) technical data and received the bomber jacket as a reward. But as it is an outfit and looked hillarious (like wearing just a jacket over colored long-johns) i scrapped it.
---
I don't know about psycho but i would love to know as it could he handy for queen fights stacked with bobbleheads.
---
Up for some testing OP?.
---
So, take off your perks and armor, and walk up to one of them.  You will die in 2-3 hits.  Maybe.
---
Damage is calculated via comparison, not total numbers.  Definitely hit up the wiki that explains it WAY better than I ever could.  Basically, though the amount of damage mitigated is determined by how much damage the hit was for, and what your armor value against that damage type is.  So if you have 500 armor, and get hit for 500, you mitigate a lot of it.  If you have 500 armor, and get hit for 2000, you mitigate MUCH less of it.  it's % based, not additive.
---
i reinstalled but the same thing keeps happening only now i could log in for 5 sec before my screen turned off is my gpu dead?
---
Peanut butter?
---
And a way to rebind the grenade/melee key! Such sad ):
---
Same on Xbox, thank goodness for the magnifier feature.
---
In many ways it is especially since you can just respawn next to them again and again and again.
---
It ends when someone gets bored and swaps servers lol.
---
Alright I'll join you :) 
---
Whatchu mean "broken"?
---
If this was true, then i would assume it should of also been disabled on AUS and EU servers which were mid day when the nukes were bugged/disabled. I have launched one since this started but only on a server outside of the US. 
---
You're the first one who went after anyone addressing my attitude in the first comment you made.  Reddiquette.
---
Still wrong, still bad.  Didn't have to wait too long, eh?
---
Settings》 key bindings i swapped them to my side buttons on my mouse.
---
So, blocking him only makes you character invisible to him, if he knows you camps place he cans till harass you, pretty stupid mechanics :(
---
My favorite mole miners during the events are the ones who stay in the dead end tunnels, breathing. Uh, what are you doing in there dude?
---
I just tested it.. I used three psycho and checked weapon damage each time and it stayed the same as using one
---
Shouldnt they be 2077 now
---
It's not that the date resets on 10-24, it's that it resets on new servers. Every time a new server spins up, it is 10-23. If you stay on the server a long time, or if you join friends that have been in a session for a while already, you'll see the date advance, 10-24, 10-25, etc. If you server hop a lot, or when the server crashes, that's when you get the groundhog day experience.
---
They shouldn't commit a crime then. Accidental or not! If you commit a crime you become wanted. If you do not pay attention and blindly fire and strike someone's owned property you become wanted. 
---
So a radio station huh what if I don't choose to join it but I want to destroy or rob someone? Will I become wanted then?
---
So meds don't stack but bobbles do.
---
So best idea for heavy damage in short bursts would be to pop meds then pop all bobbleheads.
---
One more question can I use the effects of psycho and a bobble head at the same time?
---
She visited most of the places she is heading out to before and knew them from the beginning. Hence she was able to fast travel to most of them.
---
... He says, to a subreddit dedicated to people playing the game and enjoying it.  
---
Go talk shit about it somewhere else, there are plenty of platforms already filled to the brim with critique. Are you really so insecure that you have to go insult people playing a game you don't even own? I didn't bash on NMS when it came out despite it looking like a hot piece of garbage at the time, I just... didn't buy it. I'm not gonna stop playing just so I can support YOUR weird principled idea of what a game is supposed to be.
---
You can rebind that in settings&gt;&gt;controls, but i just cant see hold breath...
---
Eh. More like 100 for the dress. 300 for the tuxes. Only because the quality on all the items are so low. The cuts are unflattering and frumpy and low detail.
---
They're going to need to drastically improve the avi graphics if they want to make any money on microtransactins.
---
Do the brotherhood quest line 
---
Yes you can when you pop both go to your status tab and you can see all active buffs.
---
I forgot about that feature in Skyrim with the Grey Beards. Yeah, so it shouldn't be that difficult to create something like minded in FO.
---
Y2K bug just hit the Nuke Code Date Generator...
---
At least one system is affected finally. 
---
Uhh are you sure? I can’t see it anywhere... whats it called exactly and what is it near, i swear i dont have it!
---
I have a spare chest 
---
Awesome thank you man!
---
Same thing happened to me I had three people trying to kill me and I think the highest level of the three was like 12 and I'm nearly 90. It was funny at first and after killing them all about 5 times it stopped been funny and just became a pain in the arse. I agree that they should be able to seek revenge but surely it should just be once and then have some king of cool down period to stop this from happening.
---
Not online at the moment but i know its there as i did that right away. Controls or something and you can change them all up.
---
If anyone else is online atm can you screenshot it for Op.
---
Np its what we are here for.
---
They told people to meet there for pictures: no one came.
---
Maybe related, nukes are not accessible right now, so no one is launching anything.
---
exactly!
---
Lol I thought I checked and there was no option. I shall check again, ty.
---
..... 😲 We can't party like it's 2076..... Because it's not 2076 anymore..... Whoaaa
---
How many purifiers do you have? I’m at 3 so far, and am hopefully going to build more
---
One year from now: "you frickin whiner noobs, back when I started playing you got disconnected constantly. Then you would spawn in to Whitesprings and get radiation and die before your screen could load! Or some moron would blow up a car next to you and ....."
---
Noob vanishes. Looks around, sees other noob.
---
"Hey dude you need any help? Man you guys got it easy these days. Back when"
---
Turrets won't react until something is broken. And he keeps coming back.
---
Um.... What?
---
Legendaries? Mine has been kind of wonky since I picked up an Anti-Armor Minigun that I can't not scroll over. Boom, crash.
---
If I carry it on me and go to the weapons bench it crashes.
---
Traps????? Mines???? Don't put some effort into this don't give up
---
Yeah I can’t tell if it only triggers on legendaries or if it’s just vastly more common on legendaries
---
I'm only level 20 but since the the first levels I dropped near oversee camp and vault 76 double recipes or stuff I can't transport because overcumbed. I'm afraid of high leveled players because everytime is like a lottery: they could be nice and kind or could slaughter you and burn your body just for joke. These last type of people are the worst and they haven't understand we aren't on Fortnite. 
---
fallout games especially offer escape. I've abused them for years to try feel better. This year I want to be better as well! and I wish you all the best and everyone else with challenges ahead. 
---
Sure. But I'm RPing a brotherhood type wannabe so really take care with radiation and don't want mutations. It's all in what you want out of playing. I take my time go slow. This is my break from career and responsibility. Just want to live in a story.
---
What in the holy name of... what are you on about man? Time travelling guy? train cart? flying scientists? I haven't ran into anything like that in the lore... And what do train carts have to do with the scorch beasts?
---
Barely viable, and the amount of perk cards needed to make it work is pretty high.
---
I had a lot more fun when I gave up on my pistol build.
---
Mine is an open CAMP. Welcome people to stop by. 
---
if you hook up a terminal (can buy one at the production vendor in the bunker) from what i understand if you hook it up to turrets tere is a kill all instantly mode on it.. but not 100% sure, going to hook it up tonight and see, have it, but been to lazy to test it, lol
---
Yup, looks like you walked into a "nuked" zone and the game calculated it all instantly :/.
---
Thats at least what happens to me. I don't see the zone until I respawn. If there is no zone .. then you need to find the mysterious stranger and have a thorough talking too with him.
---
I found that if I had something in the list that went before it that I seemed to crash less. And never scroll over 3+ in a row.
---
I don't know if that helps but good luck.
---
I know how to remap keys i just cant find it in the list, unless of course im somehow missing it under a different name or something...
---
Try r/FO76roleplay! Might have some luck there :)
---
I have a Queen to date! 
---
Yep, this is what I do in RS3. Donate time and energy into helping them grow as a person in Fallout, rather than just give them guns thwy can grief with haha. Maybe show them the ropes, teach them tips/tricks etc. That's where the rewarding feeling really is. I reapect your philanthropist approach though. Take care and happy New Year!
---
Then lets say I RP a person who consides FEV not only a virus but also a survival philosophy and I am striving to get my fellow humanity advance to next level of evolution so that they could live in the wasteland :)
---
Take care and cheers
---
I work in Second Life making and selling 3rd party content. Ie Microtransactions.  So I always compare this stuff to what I'd pay for something in Second Life, and this stuff just isnt holding up in comparison at ALL.
---
  The textures are crap. The models frumpy and unflattering. If I made stuff like this Id be out of work cause no one would buy it.
---
They need to completely redo their base model, textures, mesh, all of it. And then find a designer who knows how to make outfits that fit ibto the aesthetic AND are flattering.
---
Until they do that, they're gunna make very little on tge atom shop.
---
I don't think the area was nuked though.. I could be wrong.. but i don't think it was or had been.. 
---
Maybe this game was not planned to exist after 2k18
---
I guess that some high levels kill low players because their level effects the levels of the mobs that spawn around them.
---
y2k18
---
Sounds Bethesda-ish.
---
Because we haven’t left the vault yet! It is all a Vault-Tec experiment.
---
1st dlc will be when we discover this fact, riot and break out of the vault with our fresh level characters to a world populated with npc’s of all factions.
---
yeah, when i am at camp i leave my security doors open, and there is free purified water outside, but in you cas you should convert it a bit until he / she gives up ;)
---
But then ever single game ever released is lies then. Every game ever released has glitches and errors which are less than ideal but the game is still playable. 
---
It should be there as i swapped that to my back mouse button , auto run to my front and heavy attack/grenade to my right mouse button.
---
Sorry i can't be of more help i did it awhile ago. Maybe someone can help ya further.
---
Those turret camps out the back of the golfhouse really cheese me off. So obvious what they are trying to do.
---
How do you do that?
---
I also have a suppressors explosive Tesla Rifle with 90% reduced weight only weights like 3 lbs.
---
Thats 70 fps in a built up area and no 1080p
---
There are chickens in Appalachia. They're pretty rare though. 
---
Not sure if they drop any meat cuz I didn't kill em. 
---
r/subsyoufellfor
---
I bloody hate that bug with the queen. But the othet part man its not just scorchies the servers have been pretty unstable lately. Some reckon it might have to do with xmas crowd influx.
---
I don't care for the reasons anymore i just want to see stable servers for the game we paid for...
---
It's from the tower nearby. Just use US Government Supply Requesitions at any radio tower and supply drops will be dropped in via cargo bot with red flare markers.
---
A lot of the times it does not show the rad damage, you just flat out die after loading in. Dunno why. 
---
But it could have very well just been a invis mob or even a bug. The bug being the mysterious stranger woke up on the wrong side of the bed, lol.
---
So... has there been any update at all about the canvas bags?
---
I've submitted five or six tickets since they announced where to submit them on their website and I haven't received a reply on a single one.
---
Sweet, thanks! I thought only I saw the drops when I did that. Niice.
---
Thanks :)
---
lucky guy, i haven't seen my queen i days, after the holiday started i have seen 1 nuke to white springs, not one on  fissure prime :/ (scandinavian xbox servers)
---
So i got bored last night, started at the lowes fissure on the right side of the map, and worked my way back to watoga station, ended up with 7 downed SB's, but just bad loot, lol :)
---
This is the wrobg way to handle it though. This just makes it feel luke youre spending a ton to get very little, even if most of your purchases are with free atoms.
---
What they should be doing us flooding the store with recolots. Instead of one sequin dress for 500. Put 12 diff colors up for 100 each.   Dont have just 3 PA colors, have a hundred! And map the armors so you can have a main color and an accent, so you want to buy more colors.
---
Sell us a full respec for 100 atoms.
---
Sell us a dozen different skins for every weapon in the game.
---
Etc etc etc. 
---
On Xbox a lot of the stability issues are thanks to the duper’s. They have to cause the lag and disconnects for their duping process. 
---
Damn it. I was going to give you my support up until you said you don't want pvp removed. 
---
Would the camp owner get slap protection disabled or get a bounty if the turrets fire and kill a random?  
---
Would people get a bounty if they fire back at those turrets?
---
______
---
Inb4 people set up player-blasting forts at Whitesprings.
---
Ahhh, the good old turn base days. Good luck out running a death claw.
---
Did you enable Pacifist mode? I assumed theres no way of getting a bounty while having the mode enabled, and that actions regarded as hostile are disabled. 
---
Gz bro! Glad to see you got some good stuff.
---
&gt; wait 6 months
---
Good advice for the game publisher.
---
I have other armor and weigh reduction perks.  Bandoleer, Lone wanderer, Ironclad,  Traveling Pharmacy,  Pack rat, Aqua boy, First Aid... maybe a couple more.  I rotate in and out lockpick, hacking, armorsmith, ammosmith, super duper as needed for crafting.
---
control pannel only thing changed is the power mode its set to max 
---
This story sounds familiar. Was it a Gauss? I don't use a Gauss....
---
Either way, Wanted is already trivially busted and letting Wanted people PVP "on-the-fly" would be a nightmare.
---
Get a friend. Have them wipe your flag. It's what everyone else does. Also, stash your crap.
---
I once sat on top of the mountains in my chameleon gear and watched as another player was securing the place. After a while he left for what must’ve been his camp to the north of the factory. I snuck inside and changed ammo type and sat hidden on top of the fabricator, collecting ammo as it became available. He then came back to collect but to his surprise it was empty. I had planned to fast travel before he saw me but I couldn’t stop laughing. After he saw me up there he gave me thumbs up and then I left to let him continue doing his thing.
---
Yeah i have already said everything i can regarding that. 
---
That xbox pic today floating around of the duper stacking duped bobbleheads to get 2 million damage really upset me though.
---
Like how is that even fun?.
---
Remembering them is fine, honoring them is despicable. Remembering they are on the wrong side of morality and history.  They did not fight for a noble cause, they fought over owning people.  It’s the reason statues are being removed or tore down.  You try to rationalize (even romanticize) the soldiers while ignoring the reason. 
---
You try to separate the war from the reason and that ignores the horrors that lead to the war.  The lesson of the civil war is that all men are the same, not it was fun, let’s go play war.  I live in the south and you are misrepresenting what most fly their confederate flags for, remembrance of white supremacy.
---
I live in Johnston County NC, a place that had a klan billboard until 2012.  Don’t try to tell me it wasn’t about racism, you sound just as regarded as the locals who claim the war was about states rights and leave out the part about he states rights to own slaves.
---
Ah, okay. Yeah, revenge was definitely not gonna work. Best move when someone's trying to grief and you aren't equipped to give them a reason not to is always just to server hop.
---
I'm implying that companies shouldn't be making console releases that don't run on the console.
---
All I get from the queen is Plan: Explosive vent and Ultracite torso. Again and again. Nothing  good. Might as well farming some ghouls.
---
I'm not sure somebody has. Maybe you should, though. We would all love it
---
First thing I do is I get to The Hub and take that pistol that you get for helping some guy at the very bottom of the map to clear his farm from raiders (If I remember correctly). That pistol was my best friend throughout the whole game. Can't remember it's name but it was really loud :)
---
I don't know what I expected
---
Fucking embarrassing. 
---
It's much easier just to assume no one can be trusted in this game, and avoid people if possible. Makes things far less stressful. The only time I'm not in my PA, is crafting or wandering around alone. If I see another player near me on the map, I immediately hop into my PA and keep my maxed TSE handmade and super sledge equipped. I have yet to be targeted, harassed, or grief'd. Plus, the jet pack makes it easy to get out of the way easily.
---
PvP in FO76, outside of a few events and the matchmaking frequency thing (do people actually use any of them?), seems to be pretty griefing-focused.  There doesn't seem to be any other incentive.  You accomplish less (players don't drop gear) while negatively impacting a PvE player's experience.  And it will likely be PvE players that get hit the most, because, if the frequency of wanted players on the map is any indication, that's what most players are.
---
Still hoping they rethink how it was implemented, and maybe offer PvE and PvP servers so like-minded players can be grouped together and enjoy those respective experiences.  Separate servers would be a win-win.
---
Unless the intent is to offer PvP players a selection of victims to harass and kill.  But that would be a weird thing to build into an almost entirely PvE game.  I don't want to use the term "bullying" to describe the kind of PvP that FO76 offers, but it does seem like an accurate description, and sounds like what was described here.  They did the FO equivalent of kicking down her sandcastle.
---
Anyways...  Kinda jealous your connection lasted long enough to build a nice base, and even long enough for it to be attacked (not that I'd want that).  Almost every time I've tried to settle down in a workshop, I've been disconnected.  Either while placing structures or shortly after heading out to explore while resources are mined.
---
S'why I made a blueprint with a 4x4 cabin and all the crafting tables, with a few add-on blueprints since their capacity is kinda limiting, so I can quickly slap everything down and try to be productive before getting booted again.  Still beneficial to claim workshops for the loot and plans, but it'd be really nice if I could get proper long-term use out of them.
---
What did you dilo? Such confuse
---
Just the mods? Loop scrap for them. They should unlock fairly early.
---
The biggest issue is that initual burst of atoms. We get a ton in the vegining with not much to buy.
---
The only solution I see for them is to start cranking out as many cosmetics as possible for people to blow points on. But so far their releases have been small and overpriced. They could have easily took that sequin dress and recolored it a bunch of colors to fill out their offerings 
---
&gt;I agree that it's a bit ridiculous, never ever in any Bethesda/open world rpg have we ever had to pay? 
---
I mean, that's true, but also, this isn't a single player rpg. Teleporting costing money is a thing in pretty much every mmo/online rpg ever.
---
I knew from your title what you had done...m
---
They need to take off mods from scrapping. This shit is not funny at all. Also PSA it prioritizes mods over bulked steel. Do not make the same mistake as us keep steel healthy and not bulked 
---
Dunno if that was our jam session, but to all wastelanders: swing on by and help yourself to the water and gardens. Rest your weary soul and relax by the lake. Fix your equipment and join me in the studio for some sweet tunes. The wasteland can be a drag, but don't let it get you down. 
---
Mods are used as steel when repairing. He needed to repair his junk node so it pulled apart his jetpack mod to repair it.
---
When xXPussyDestroyerzXx777 doesnt shoot you
---
Agreed. My biggest gripe with the critics is that they keep comparing it to an MMO and expect MMO features.
---
Sounds like I wasted a perk slot. 
---
Did not know this myself.... thanks for the PSA.
---
They do. Chicken thigh. 
---
I love this entire story. I’m just shy of 170 but I don’t mess with people unless they mess with me.
---
Its been on constant sale since black Friday, at least here in the UK.
---
Yeah but then I guess this is the issue when you're dancing on the line of a true mmo and a regular open rpg. 
---
Personally all I want from this game is the option of personal, or at least pacifist servers. I think I must be one of the few people that wasn't asking for mmo/PvP/pure online play from a fallout game. I like the idea of end game events where you can work as a team but as someone who works 50 hours a week and enjoy more than one game I just wanna come on and play a traditional fallout experience without getting chased and dogged by people 4x my level. 
---
yeah, i also got just about the same the first 3 times, but then something changed, just missing 1 land to be able to build the itracite armor from scratch if i want, and thing i have primary receiver / capacitor plans for all guns, and don't forget about the nice xp :)
---
Nuke springs can be fun, but to many xp hoarders there, only time you will see me there is if i feel the need to pick flowers, lol
---
D; that's just wrong
---
Bethesda games just tickle a sweet spot in me where I just enjoy them regardless of anything. Their strongest aspect is their environmental storytelling and worldbuilding, and they delivered in F76 as much as their previous titles IMO.
---
But really you should save your stuff for a future DLC. I agree, right now, there's basically no real end game. I've replaced the lack of end game with fixating on fashion and decor, which I would do anyway even if there were an end game.
---
Maybe they didn't expect people to get through the game so quickly, hence the last few nerfs to leveling and grinding. But Bethesda games are about being weak at the start and becoming OP as hell. I never went through their games for a real challenge, I went through to feel that sense of progression to godhood where you're just invincible and turn into a walking tornado. You're not "too good" at the game, or bad, you just get better stats. I personally enjoy that type of gameplay, but I know many other people don't and I don't blame them. They'd prefer something more skillful rather than gear checks.
---
I'm going above 170 now (without exploits) and I'm *still* having fun, despite the bugs and all. I don't blame you for losing interest but at least make sure to pick it up again in a year or so. Maybe there'll be more stuff to do.
---
It looks like they might be lowering the prices as the trickle of atoms slows for a lot of players. Maybe the New Years prices are just a fluke, but they'd be smart to continuously lower them to near baseline pricing as time goes on. 
---

---
You can't rob people in the first place outside of rp purposes so that doesn't do anything. With constant PvP you could rob someone and actually trade their life for their stuff, but in the current situation I can just walk away or server hop and not care. 
---
The wanted system I'm fine with in theory, as long as you aren't a sitting duck, which you are. The punishment for being wanted should be you are highlighted on the map and have a reward for killing you. If someone comes after you you should be able to defend yourself, it is essentially "this guy wants me dead so I want him dead, oh buy wait I need to wait for him to shoot me for full damage before I can hurt him and depending on their gear means I can't do anything to retaliate." Wanted would be a great way to bring attention to yourself and initiate PvP with other players except it doesn't work that way.
---
There is no point to break someone else's property since you can't place camps on locations meaning you can't block off locations. The most you can do is take someone's water, food, and resource collectors which don't give you wanted in the first place and need a lock to actually give someone wanted but with the caps on how much you can produce without emptying it there isn't enough incentive to warrant it anyways. Because the 10 purified water that took this guy with 4 water purifiers that took 5 minutes to refill with is so valuable.
---
At least give us some warning message or something. There should definitely be an option as to what you use to repair something
---
Great post my dude!  Spot on. Upvoted 👍🏻
---
I don't know I've been seeing a lot of posts saying that they closed it for New Year's for the event at White Springs or whatever. But there's no official word from Beth.
---
Some say bugged and others say they closed them for new years.
---
All we have to work off is a twitter post about a Whitespring new years party. Nothing about nukes so we are just guessing this is the case.
---
Many are asking them to answer us and tell us whats going on via reddit, forums and twitter.
---
Hopefully we can get back into our end game soon.
---
I think it was done to keep people from nuking new year's parties
---
I'm afraid I lack the technical know-how, but I can always try.
---
What event st bethesda?

Fucking *EMBARASSING!!*
---
Just completed this quest on 1/1/2019.
---
There were waves of one scorched every minute or so.
---
I got a couple of stimpacks, some screws, some missiles, and a power fist.
---
I'm guessing they fixed the rewards from it but be warned that this is a low level event.
---
no idea yet, but a very good question :)
---
10/10 will read again.
---
Sorry for your loss, but that's one great story.
---
I'm not really sure but I've heard people say that there's like New Year's party/event at Whitesprings.
---
I guess there was a bar you were supposed to go to and take a picture and most likely closed nukes so low lv didnt get killed. 
---
Yeah was just venting after hitting my limits with their lack of doing anything to stop it for seven weeks. Expected to cop it for venting on here instead the community rallied behind it and shared their own  hatred for it.
---
Still no reply from Bethesda though.... was a good try i guess.
---
I felt like the game was too easy for teaming up, especially when it comes to teaming up with a high level.
---
You should probably let people know the system
---
The Brotherhood of Steel has already been restored ;D You find us here! [https://discord.gg/PnEgyW7](https://discord.gg/PnEgyW7)
---
&gt; On Xbox a lot of the stability issues are thanks to the duper’s.
---
Source?
---
Shouldn't it be WFC? Lol 
---
In case you want some meats, I know a spot that spawns chickens, radstags, opossums, frogs, etc. It where I put my camp. Just north of MorganTown high school, under the big power line tower. Every time I load in I have easy meats. And chickens show up pretty often, just as often as the others. On my alt I put my camp in the same spot and built a fence around the perimeter so stuff couldnt run as I spawned it. You coudm make an alt, run maxed Good with Salt perk and use it to farm meat. May he better places to get it, but this area works for me.
---
Siiiick. Thanks!
---
The devs want people to be able to "harass" you by damaging your Camp. It's okay. We should praise this kind of thing. Just for fun, I sometimes go there and destroy people's camp with Heavy Gun. I'm not the only one. It's glorious to see all the walls just crumble. That's why everyone should build good defenses around the base, punish the Wanted guy by killing him to gain Caps and Bounty losing some Caps. And repairing all the shit is not too bad. I try not to destroy Decontamination shower, cuz it's just plain stupid that you'd have to pay Flux to repair it.
---
Go try it out yourself, it's actually pretty fun, but it costs a lot of Caps. I guess max Bounty is 950 Caps, because I couldn't go higher, after that there's always someone just gonna come one-shot with Explosive Shotgun and there's nothing you can do, other than jetpacking on top of skyscrapers.
---
It was a lv 13 at whitesprings golf course. After almost 300hr in this game theres not much to do but help. Happy new year. 
---
Names Vextroa on pc
---
We were able to launch a nuke on Fissure Site Prime at the stroke of midnight CST. Took a screenshot of our SBQ kill (not sure how to get it out of FO76 on Xbox). 
---
I got some great loot.... a walking cane, my 3rd Ultracite Left leg plan as well as my 3rd Ultracite Explosive vents....😩
---
Your welcome
---
Harpy Nyoo Rear Errybuddeee!
---
Do some research on the duping process and/or read the link above that has some of the “sources”
---
Of course you can steal from players. If someone doesn't lock something it's up for grabs. If they lock it, they don't want it taking so by taking it I'm stealing. 
---
The value is to the player if they lock it, whatever it is. It holds value to them. 
---
To bring attention to wanting to pvp join the Hunter/Hunted radio station that exists. Don't use the Wanted system!
---
I feel you are missing the point of the wanted system, it is present to punish criminals. The higher the bounty the higher their crime.
---
It's not supposed to be "fair" it's to mark them for their crimes and allow people to hunt them. 
---
You had a bad experience and came up with an idea that could open doors to grief far worse than what you experienced. 
---
You want a system that would let you "opt out" because you don't want to pvp.
---
It exists: Its Pacifist Mode. 
---
Whaaat..... I always wondered what those substations were for.
---
It took me a little while but i kept visiting Blackwater mine when no higher levels were around to get most my lvl 15 PA armor &amp; then the right leg came from a suit in Clarksburg(upper floor of the 2 story building, access via fire escape)
---
I'm in the **exact** same boat man.
---
Level 202, been playing since release and got all my items and levels legit. I've farmed whitesprings and Uranium Fever/Violent Night/AWOL so many times I've lost count.
---
Yesterday, I logged in, walked around my CAMP a bit. Considered going to whitesprings, considered going to watoga, then logged out. Logged back in again, logged out.
---
Then realized I just didnt really care anymore. What was I even going to do once I got that god weapon roll? Farm some more with it? For what?
---
Its too bad really. I *did* enjoy my time, im not saying I hated the game, obviously I didnt or I wouldnt be level 202. 
---
Maybe I played too much, maybe im burnt out, but it just feels like Ive totally run out of things to do.
---
Your lucky if you can get 500 each atm dupers flooded the market.
---
I sell them for 500 caps each on xb1.
---
Wasn’t there a similar location in 4?
---
You are a worthy enemy and we need more people like you in this game.  Especially when pvp is not working very well.  Psychological warfare!
---
Check r/fo76bazaar fellow trader.
---
Yep same did it last week   Lost Jet Pack and another 4 X01 mods.  I had bought them for a sick friend.  Protected them all week, had lots of bulk steel, made no difference all gone.   Sort of tested since, bought an X01 mod, needed to repair extractor in Uranium Mine event.  It took the Mod first then the bulk/scrap.  Truly an awful bit of mechanics by big B that keeps on giving out dissapointment and despair.
---
Omg I thought this was! Sorry lmao I’m gonna delete and repost 
---
What’s the damage of the dragon without perks?
---
Me to until now
---
Sweet, you'll have time to brush up on your English composition skills.
---
Its ok i have done that as well lol.
---
If you ever tried building a sandcastle at the beach as a kid, those kids that destroys it for their own amusement is griefers.
---
Block exits, destroy stuff, or otherwise trying to ruin other peoples fun in the game for their own enjoyment.
---
I know stash my crap, I was just getting back from a Sugar Grove run and a scorch beast was in the air and I shot someones shack on accident while fighting it. Can't do anything about it now.
---
Also I don't understand why so many people think free PvP would be such a bad thing, it's an extremely common mechanic in other multiplayer survival games, granted griefing would be a problem but you can say that about any of those games.
---
I thought if you 'Blocked for Session' then hop servers they cant rejoin you? This is what I have been doing when someone is pesky with invites and it works for me.
---
I struggle with this as well. I usually have to get up and walk closer to the TV to read these. I do find that it’s worth it though.
---
Yes you can remap the heavy attack/grenade from left alt to other keys, but my question asked if you can remap hold breath key, remapping heavy attack/grenade doesn’t seem to change the hold breath for me...
---
I am playing the game still and enjoying it, but the end-game is seriously lacking.  Server hopping / RNG vendor lottery mini-game gets old really fast and was just a dumb design choice.  Grinding out legendaries in blast zones is another lottery - hoping the server doesn't crash or you do not get disconnected.
---
Once Bethesda fixes all of the stability problems and creates meaningful end-game content, I will be happy.
---
Replying for later cause I need to do that
---
Maybe I’ll get a bottle of cranberry moonshine and pull up a chair one of these days.
---
Ok , thanks for clearing that up 😁 used to beat ppl like that up with my cousin when we were kids lol 
---
Looks like the plaything of Scaramanga's meaner big brother.
---
Hey if you ever want to play together my IGN is the same as my name here. Caps sensitive of course, not sure if that matters or not for the game, but I'd be down to play and hangout sometime. I'm on the west coast and usually playing every day. 
---
Ok so server stability has always been an issue. First it was blamed on first day load. Then on carry weight bugs. Then on dupers. Then on Xmas load. Then on dupers again.
---
That link has literally no evidence in it to link duping to server stability.
---
I didn’t really struggle more than I expected too early on, but the two players I helped sure seemed to be
---
One guy told me to stop complaining about the turret camps because i can just "shut the doors" to the golf course to keep them from running outside.  Imo?  If you need an army of turrets to help you clear a location, maybe you should pick a more level appropriate location.  
---
I will have a look at the location. Your camp looks cool! 
---
Free PVP isn't a bad thing, but it depends on the game....
---
In other games, if you get crushed in a PVP mode you can usually say "Oh, I _could have gotten away_ or done something different" and reevaluate. Possibly make some corrections. You'll feel value in developing skills and your character. For games without this process for the player it is just frustrating to know you lost for reasons entirely out of your control.
---
This is a Bethesda title. There isn't usually a skill gap. Whoever had friends and got lucky at Whitesprings wins and cannot be defeated. That isn't a show of (or lack of) skill. That's double backstabs and backstep teleports in Dark Souls levels of wtfery. It's unfun and unrewarding.
---
Missing out on a lot of damage output without the amor penetration from stabilised. 
---
After a few glasses of Chardonnay he loosens up a bit and will gladly wear the clown suit. 
---
I’m quite aware. I still refuse to wear it tho 🤷‍♂️ 
---
I’ve never been a fan of PA. 
---
Put a regular floor, then hit the scrap, instead though hit replace and scroll through until you get the laminate, see if that works. Have had that same floor forever and its always worked
---
can't just be that I'm angry over being harassed.
---
Pretty much all 500.
---
I have no idea if they're duped or crafted or .... delivered by mole miner AI....
---
Lucky hole mining trips know all about it!
---
Do you know how much they produce?  Thanka for the tip, very helpful.
---
I think you misunderstand me, I want a way that encourages PvP mode without it being pointless for the wanted person, the pvp radio doesn't bring attention to you otherwise I would use it. I enjoy the pvp in this game when it is 2 sided
---
Griefing is a consequence of having an online game, granted it isn't popular because this game literally has no reward for griefing or engaging another player for PvP. Like I said in the post link it to the radio. Just keep pacifist mode 100% pacifist
---
I've had my fair share of good and bad experiences with wanted system but the majority agree that it is a broken system.
---
It might not be top tier but itll help those people solo spam beasts and contribute on the queen
---
Was trying to defend the junkyard in the forest. Last molerat buried and never resurfaced. Found him on the map, he was now down in the middle of the ash heap and not moving. Got any intercontinental molotov rockets i could borrow?
---
I hate how they attach it to using PA, essentially makes it mandatory if you want to maximise damage with heavy weapons. 
---
Having the perks penetration and accuracy scale with strength, would be better in my opinion. 
---
I love pvp too.  It adds a level of excitement/danger.  I want to have to look over my shoulder, and i want to bunker up in my camp against an assault of raiders.  I think the happy medium here, unlike games like rust, is that you dont lose weapons or armor when you die.  Id love a balanced pvp server (without these one shot weapons)
---
What you described happenend to me in FO4 when i reached lvl 170. I just finished my last big settlement and after that i just kept checking my settlers, talking to people and just be there. Im lvl 30 in Fo76 and starting to feel the same. What motivates me are all the plans to build stuff and just generally killing enemies. 
---
Call of duty and destiny 2 work fine for me. What I've basically found is that dx11 games don't work and dx12 do. I've basically accepted it's a Windows 10 thing and have just dealt with it
---
What system? 
---
~~old man~~
---
Ps4 xbox pc?????
---
Could you send a picture of the map location? I don't see it on the interactive website map. 
---
Has somebody tested that wepon even without quad legendary?
---
After my vendor runs, if I have leftovers I just drop them off at flat woods (last stop) or 76 at the first Los lcl player I see. 
---
Been hard the last few things cuz I havent been using my mic but thank God for thumbs up and brown bags not disappearing if you accidentally shot at it when trying to shot by it 
---
You aren't one of the few mate, you are one of many who enjoys this game in spite of it's flaws and are waiting for it to be pulled together.
---
its in the watoga / ruined city area, there's a traincart with notes of nutter scientist and a metal portal.. i guess you dont dont explore ??
---
10 or 100 energy they probably depend on the nuclear reactors if you start them up then they should provide 100 energy
---
No you helped thanks, i'm on ps4
---
Can’t join any world. Infinite “Searching for world”. Atomic store is down too
---
It would but then again, FO76 has a lot of design choices that make no sense. That perk is one of them. 
---
I understand it is for thematic reasons but forcing a whole arch type into one particular type of armor is wrong. 
---
My hope is that maybe they’ll realize that later. Until then, I’ll continue to just deal with it. lol 
---
Then don't use the wanted system to pvp it's not for that. Join Hunter/Hunted or put on Pacifist mode. 
---
Wanted is Punishment. 
---
I can't even understand your complaint.
---
A sneak nerf?  Sneak is only really useful against mobs isnt it.  Unless you mean the chameleon effect? Im max sneak with chameleon and its really only the chameleon that gives me the edge in battles. Unless you mean the sneak multiplier damage?  
---
Cannot stack Bobbleheads, for anyone wanting to know
---
200+ hours in under 2 months since release? Goodness, that’s like a full time job. 
---
I don’t understand people who rush to the end of a game and then whine about not having enough content. 
---
It doesnt have to be removed.  We just need servers for pve and pvp.  So people can choose what they feel like doing.  Feel like fighting?  Pick a pvp server today.  Feel like explorig and collecting?  Choose a pve server today. I feel that would be a good option to have.
---
Chat is important for deaf and mute people! I'll  bet their management probably had a meeting and decided it would cost too much to support people with disabilities.
---
Ah I see the they’ve always been keen to flog these games - Even from pre-2000s
---
Can I use psycho and a bobble head at the same time though?
---
It makes sense and I understand what you are saying, but the same thing happens in other titles as it is very common so see a group of people with very high level gear terrorizing a server while raiding and killing everything they see, and it's solved the same way either server hop or work your way up the food chain and challenge them.
---
Also dark souls 1 PvP is just learning the techs and escapes to properly counter it
---
Someone yanked a bag off a duper group and found this.

---
They bombed the market in every form tis sad for all us roleplaying as traders for others.
---
I agree that there isn't a good excuse for FO76 being released as it was. This is more of a critique of your ability to present your case.
---
Your first analogy was "it was harder back in the day." I think you you were defending bugs from that time period? Your second analogy is first about construction and buildings. I'm still not sure what your point was. Maybe that if you throw enough resources at a problem, it'll be resolved? Of the titles I listed with bugs, I think only one ("hunt the wumpus") was a single person project. Then you move to bridge failures. I don't know why. Office building failures happen frequently, but they are small in scale and typically result in small scale loses. Things like elevator doors failing to close allowing a blind person to fall down the shaft. They are an almost perfect analogy for modern software. I guess you don't watch the news, cause bridges fail all the time, and it's always big and expensive when it happens.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bridge_failures
---
And it happens in the USA. Take for example the Florida International University pedestrian bridge collapse in March of this 2018. Six killed and nine injured. Route 41 and other connecting streets were closed around it for ten days.
---
Afaik they're all 40% (Fallout 4 stats, there was a mod that used to show you numbers....).
---
People have gone back and forth about the wording (for those people, please mod a Gauss and if you aren't laughing....) and performance, but pretty sure they're all the same.
---
I don't know exactly how they should do it, but sneak is brutal against wanted players. You can easily  just crouch and destroy them in one hit. It's pretty messed up too. You'll notice that if you crouch right beside someone and hit them over and over you continue to get sneak damage. 
---
PC: 1k to 1.5k, but dropping down all the time, cuz more and more ppl get the recipe, and more and more ppl dont need the serums to get mutations. 
---
It's not really outside the realm of possibilities.  Dont engage in PVP activities and bam.  Single player game.
---
I wish we had donation boxes.  Id donate to your restaurant for sure!
---
Yeah, I've given up on trading and crafting entirely .....
---
Even without the dupers it's kind of pointless.
---
1. I know what the wanted system is
---
2. I lodged my complaint, saying how I think it should be fixed
---
3. I didn't downvote you. Check my history before you assume next time
---
NEW CONTENT ?? or...... it just works
---
I feel so betrayed by vengeful Mothman. why does he has to violate me instead of big lämp
---
My eyesight is fine and I cant read a damn thing in this game either.  Youre not alone op.
---
Oh yeah, New Years crowds are for suckers, plus I seem to be on cold #3 of the season. I'm sorry if I sounded meaner than I'd meant to. 
---
I'm still holding in there but everythings value has just bombed it makes it not worthwhile. It takes alot of time , stash space and setup to get items people want. Then here comes johnny duper selling things dirt cheap in insane numbers... worse some of them sell for real money like for the god tier guns.
---
Or they stack on bobble heads they dupe and run around with 2 million damage weapons...
---
Don't see how they even find it fun..
---
I'm on EU servers and it's been like this for me since yesterday afternoon, so before the new year even started. I found a couple of silo officers but they had no codes, and the surveillance terminal cannot look for silo codes. My guess too is that it's a calendar / new years thing, I suppose we'll find out in time... 
---
Lol there is a perk that lets your throw things farther 👍
---
Chill bro. 
---
1.You obviously didn't as you find becoming a criminal and wrong doing someone should give you fair chance. Try not to become wanted. Use Pacifist or suck it up that someone claimed your bounty. 
---
2. Your idea could cause so many more problems. If implemented I could shoot a friends base for 10 caps and then roam freely one shotting whoever I want and stealing all their junk. 
---
3. BIG OOF! Always an easy trigger!
---
I have all the mutations hahaha I'm mad! M A D!
---
NA and EU aren't separated as far as i know?
---
I've come across quite a few NA people, and i'm from the EU myself.
---
That's on pc though, so it might be different with consoles.
---
i'd say my experience has been about 90% positive with just a few bad apples.
---
Yep. Tended to spawn a Behemoth
---
I'm not sure how they should do it exactly. Maybe the modifiers would be okay alongside an over damage nerf. It got some kinks that need to worked out though. You can crouch right next to someone and get sneak damage over and over if you go to their side or behind. They should probably make it so you decloak after firing as well. 
---
well crap. I dropped mine too for the same reason.
---
Griefers = Bullies

It's even older and was renamed twice.
---
\&gt;  1997; 21 years ago (As NetImmerse) 
---
40% armour penetration? That's much better than I thought. I thought we were looking at 10-25%. Maybe I can finally retire that .44 you get early on with 50% armour penetration.
---
Your method works really well haven't had my game crash for 2days now thanks
---
Me and the husband wrecked the wastelands together last night! Although we were in bed by 12.. ah, a parents rock and roll life style.
---
Yeah, there's no food chain in this game. :P I don't know if you were around back when we couldn't damage lower level players but that was special. The grind to get all the mods unlocked for your favorite armor/weapons is utterly pointless. You can't even sell what you've gained. There isn't a meta.
---
And DS1 is trash PVP. The meta there is first to twitch loses and don't even get started on the early games or Remastered......
---
Do those events reward the PA plans?
---
LoL! Pardon me. Must be my dutch accent. Thought i heard it when Neo approached Cypher in the Matrix.  
---
Seriously, though, is this quest bugged?  Doesn't matter how many times I kill a wendigo in a clown costume and complete the quest, it always reappears in my data log when I log off and then back in.
---
Fixed:

[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/202](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/202)?
---
Not only can other people loot them as well, they even get a quest marker showing them the location.
---
I'm on PC, I play a max stealth rifleman. I could do with a stealth partner also.
---
Thank you I'm curious though if I Loot one of them can other people still loot it?
---
it's alright, but by all means (at least in my opinion) is not as good as it is in fallout 4. snapping is way more finicky, there's hardly anything in terms of customization compared to vanilla fallout 4 (unless you want to buy each customization for $5+ in the atom shop), and I think everybody's favorite part is the camp budget. it's so ridiculously small that you can throw big projects right out the window. my house is a two story 3x3 with every work bench, one small generator, five turrets, a couch, a map, a bed, a chair, and five stalks of corn. I'm at 100% of my budget and can't build anymore 
---
If it's the same as fo4. YMMV, etc.
---
You also have perks to add armor penetration as well as the Anti-Armor legendary effect.
---
I have a Duel Bar mod thats supposed to add a 2nd blade. I'll test it and see if it tears shit up faster.
---
Dense mods huh. Somebody got bored of killing themselves with ecploding weapons. Gz on the RNG win.
---
On Pc, friend and I couldn't get voice chat to work. Checked people in the server and everyone had their mic off. Tried every voice setting but no luck. Server issue? Tried multiple reloads and restarts also with no luck.
---
You can have the effects of a chemical and a bobblehead active at the same time. So in that regard, yes.
---
You cannot use more than one bobblehead at a time. You can however, use a bobblehead, magazine, and 1 chem to get some serious firepower. 
---
Nah. This was more a completionist thing. I still kill myself with my exploder. ;)
---
The Marine Dense is shenanigans. The plan is named incorrectly and I haven't unlocked it in what surely has to be thousands of scraps now.
---
Your link proves nothing. Not even a picture or video of what happened.
---
1. Couldn't you do the same thing on the pvp radio to people, walk up one shot them and then take their stuff, if you remove pacifist from the equation and just make it so you can't steal from a pacifist player than you have solved the problem
---
2. There is no trigger it's just check your information before you accuse someone. 
---
I may not agree with your opinion but I can tell that no amount of convincing from either of us is going to change our opinions and fake internet points are the least of my concern.
---
The same way you equip Goblin mail.
---
Loot is instanced, so everyone that comes across them can loot it.
---
Not sure when they despawn though, from my personal experience they seem to stay for quite a while. 
---
You can add mods if you are on pc, and there is even a mod on Nexus right now for a new radio station.
---
There are plenty of previous programming implementations of games, open world games, and software testing practices. Refusing to learn from those and then making the claim that it's hard to do something as an excuse Is incompetence.
---
Yes, buildings and bridges to fail. Typically buildings After a long time. If a bridge failed immediately after its construction like in Florida, and bridges typically don't fail immediately after construction. Does that Indicate that the designer/ builder are incompetent, or that bridges are just hard to build in a reliable way?
---
To bring that back to the game, if a game is released in an unstable state, and other games with similar functionality and budgets are released in a stable state. Does that indicate that the game designer is incompetent, or that games are hard to build in a reliable way?
---
R/whoosh
---
Only to level 45 though. 
---
I think it looks cool too. The lamp posts look good. I’ll have to try to find those. 
---
Hahaha, no. You're thinking about it like an intelligent human being. I guarantee you, the bigwigs over at Bethesda are not doing that, they look at how well Fortnite did with BR (and Sweeney made 7 billion dollars), and want a piece of THAT pie. Doesn't matter that the dev team doesn't have the chops for it. Doesn't matter that the engine is all wrong for it. Money, money, money!
---
Figures I finally got around to doing the actually sorry quests and planned on dropping my first nuke today.
---
Happened to me last night at the white springs Train station! inside it.
---
I hear it's a fun place
---
It is crazy how much better of a game odyssey is than this. Started playing it myself the other day and it is great. Bigger in size and looks and runs way better by far.
---
Same and I'm level 90
---
;D ty 4 the assist. Happy New Year!
---
YMMV?
---
I saw that rifle penetration perk. I'm thinking of getting it. I've been very inconsistent with my build. Some shotguns, some pistols, some rifles, a brief bit of fantastic yee-haw-inducing fun with a .50 cal machine gun and a 3* legendary glowing one.
---
I guess that this new card system is good if you want to change your build from time-to-time, although I wish I could see everything on one screen.
---
GOG had them for free too, I have both 1&amp;2 and tactics again because of those giveaways. I just hope they let us gift the games because I would love to give it to a friend who loved Wasteland 2, I know he''ll play these.
---
 I love it it's like a little village
---
I didn't know that, defend events at munitions usually put me a bit outside or at least they did last I played (which was a couple weeks and an update ago).
---
Yeah, they should just make the text red for owned items like in EVERY OTHER FALLOUT BETHESDA
---
Astonishing lack of shitheads indeed, I never forgive offences done to me, I am level 157 now, I had just a SINGLE bad encounter
---
Certain aspects of this game require pvp... why did you buy a game that had pvp if you don’t want any part of it? 
---
What am I supposed to do if you have a workshop claimed and I want to claim it for myself? 
---
Something small and simply and oddly peaceful.
---
Dude that is awesome!  Love it.
---
The food chain thing is right, everything seems viable but also at the same time not and I was around for the less damage to lower level player, which I'm glad that it got fixed as a bug but it was also a good way to prevent curb stomping a new player.
---
Ds1 PvP is good, just only if you learned the tech. If you didn't it was a nightmare. I personally prefered ds2 PvP as I felt it was a good balance of between the jankyness of ds1 and the staring contest that was ds3 pvp.
---
I always had a trailer as my player home in Fo4! And The Mire is by far my favourite area, so this is awesome! Thank you so much, I'll look into it! 
---
Yeah I agree, but not sure either how to best balance it.  Right now, one shot kills are my playstyle.  Im too squishy to to survive missing any shots.  So if we removed this from the game we would be essentially removing sniper playstyle altogether unfortunately.  How do other games balance this?  I hate to compare to rust, but its the only pvp experience I have. The snipers there can one shot kill you, but so can any well placed shot from any weapon in that game.  It boils down to who gets the drop first really...which I think is fair.  But damn frustrating at the same time lol.

10 wood and 10 steal are all your resources? 
---
Your Mileage May Vary. I could be wrong. The dataminers could be wrong. 76 might actually have a difference. Space rays may interfere, etc.
---
I wasn't excited about the hotswap perks but it's starting to grow on me.
---
Yeah I've been playing Fallout 76 for a while and I'm getting sick of hearing the same old songs repeat on the radio sometimes they'll even play like within like 15-20 minutes of each other
---
Thanks dude we even have a little shitter hanging off the side of the mountain and the tree beside us has a complementary noose for when the game crashes win win 
---
It’s actually really unexpected and heartwarming. I’ve lost my voice at the moment so I can’t mic, but even when I could I found that people just ignore you and run by or act wary of you unless they’re many levels above you, in excavator pa and passing through your workshop with a wave and then gone. Even as a low level I’ve tried a few times to give what I can to new players - the vast majority of the time they just ignore it or run away, no matter how safe or friendly I try to convey that I am. But for a multiplayer game, F76 feels pretty lonely to me; not due to the lack of non-human NPCs, but because it’s an expanse full of people all doing their own thing.
---
The few times you come across anyone else outside of Flatwoods, the Overseer’s camp or Morgantown Airport, they either open fire or attempt to grief until they make themselves wanted or tire and leave in frustration (I’m pacifist), or as I say, they barely if ever acknowledge your presence even when you wave and say hello. Levelling up alone takes (me, at least) a long time, and it’s hard to find certain kinds of loot; so when high-level players appear out of nowhere and drop off free junk (without blocking the exit and opening fire when you move in to take the bait and you’re out of stimpacks with only purified water left), it’s really nice and makes me feel like people do actually care about other players. I tried expressing that by offering an exchange bag of healing supplies to one player, but they kindly let me keep it and what they’d given me. Another time, when a nuke went off near the old location of my C.A.M.P. and it got assailed by high-level ticks, a player came and gave me free weapons and healing supplies and junk.
---
What are you talking about you're going to get banned why would you encourage people to mod dude
---
What magazines increase damage?
---
I am one of those guys with explosive shottys, but I always start the fight from tagging all the enemies with my laser pistol and then only using explosives on monsters I've seen being hit by nearby players
---
I play on Xbox everyday for 3-4 hours at a time on a single server. Never had any of these issues or disconnects. 
---
Are you on a OG XB1 or a XB1X?
---
Blame the people duping, I've spent most of my sessions looking for them if i start having a hard time with the connection. 
---
I've tried doing this, but I couldn't find the connection point.
---
Now I’m this game we can find out how they made it and what events transpired before that to make the return possible
---
3 similar suits is a lot different than like 10 different things
---
Yeah I think some mods conflict with it so you can test this out by deleting some of the mods and then seeing if it allows you to make a pocketed one. Hope this helps
---
How else do you think he can give millions of prezzies away each year?
---
I leave my water purifier unlocked with a sign saying 'free water'
---
I also keep my door locked at a 3 because I don't want anyone inside.
---
I know you can't actually steal anything, but I also don't want people just walking into my house damnit 🤣
---
it added a special zone that had some test weapons in it that had never been balanced and a file location that the next time you played the game if you clicked it they auto were there at start of the new games 
---
You're not a martyr, just hyperbolic.  There are more than "a few sticking up" for the game.
---
[Most] (https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/12/13/fallout-76-magazines-locations-what-the-magazines-do-2/) of the Astonishingly Awesome Tales have damage buffs. I use the 15% scoped damage one mostly. 
---
i encountered him in whitesprings in a blast zone
---
Sort of looks like Canadian singer [Marie-Pierre Arthur](http://mariepierrearthur.com/img/mpa-share.jpg)
---
Honestly the hardest part e
---
Was finding the spot ones we did it all just fit together we didn't want it too cramped or overly complicated no defences because it never gets attacked no one ever bothered us it's pretty chill not going to lie 
---
It's a tiny box, probably at the back of it with a switch
---
Her Speed Demon mutation and Gun Runner perk actually stack.
---
I see. Still, it would be nice if they were clearer on what exactly is changing. 'improved' 'superior'. Sometimes the numbers are on screen but don't change, or change by 1. I miss DPS stats.
---
Yes, I agree about the card system. Unfortunately, the random drops are a bit off. I have about 8 spare cards in one SPECIAL and zero in another. Sometimes I want to boost one SPECIAL but there are no perks worth getting.
---
But it is definitely growing on me. If I'd decided to stop using shotguns after getting a shotgun perk that I couldn't remove I'd be kicking myself for wasting points, but I just switched it out for a carry weight perk.
---
Check out ATOM RPG. :)
---
When you drink all your alcohol for the carry weight
---
me and my friends prefer it cause several times we would miss people asking us for help and then turn and see them run over just in time only to realize we were within ear shot the entire time just not realizing it cause of team chat 
---
auto should really only add team chat to proximity so if I move out of range of proximity they can hear me rather then cut out all local - if someone wants to go pure team they can select that 
---
First, you gotta make up a batch of moonshine. Then, take some flowers (any will do, but especially ash rose and bergamot - Wendy loves the flavour), a clown costume, and the moonshine over to the wendigo cave. Then you have to find a friendly looking wendigo, and drop the flowers in front of it first, then the moonshine, then finally the clown costume. If the wendigo accepts your offering, it will sniff the flowers, drink the moonshine, put on the costume, and then pass out. You can then finish the quests easily.
---
If it doesn’t, you have about 2 seconds to run before it eats you.
---
yeah i share your experience too but i think we both got on this RNG trolled from the game but i can witness it my self after my information from reddit and test it my self on my leather test example. i couldnt believe it either after that but it is true and saddly a missing information from the game itself.
---
Please show another thread to prove your dupers stacking bobbleheads theory. Sounds like a crock of shit.
---
You can still become wanted in pacifist mode.  You just can't engage in PVP, though you can still be killed by PVP.
---
Where the heck can i get an X01 armour set from? I tried watching youtube vids to find it, but cannot handle the "smash that subscribe button and like guyzzzzzz". Any tips where to look? I heard you can build them?
---
I rented it for 3 days.  got to level 16.  I agree that everything was just. too. EASY!  I never felt the danger of a real wasteland.  level 1 I ran into a group of super mutants and thought "oh no," for a second, then started shooting them with the first gun I had found lying around.  Real super mutants should have wiped the floor with me, but I killed them all.   I also couldn't get over the game crashing constantly.  I don't know what the problem is but the server disappearing constantly ruined so many quests for me that I decided to return the game and I won't be buying it unless I see some reports that that problem has been vastly improved.  I'll follow the subs looking for it, because I really want to like this game, but so far it's just disappointing. 
---
Ew click bait
---
Even if you found the puddle, they're bugged right now and at least in my experience, unlootable. Same goes with ash piles from lasers and teslas.
---
I picked up that holo tape before i even launched a nuke. I was so confused because i didn't do anything. That lady weird as fuck boiii
---
Demolition expert is your best friend with TSE weapons. I picked up a TSE lever action and with only 2 lvls of demo expert the damage went from 540 to 649.
---
Also don't forget perks that affect pistols and the highest dmg receiver you can pick up.
---
I just don't bother with sleeping.
---
Yes, I miss out on an XP bonus, but whatever.
---
Pistol damage cards + explosives card (in int) + two shot + bloody damage luck card + drugs = big numbers
---
Sounds like you want to play a game like sims? Why buy a game that has pvp, guns ,and nukes if you don’t want to use them?
---
Bone worms 
---
Not possible the thread was deleted i knicked the photo from their link. Its unlikely from bobbleheads since they sure hell don't stack for me. But the person was sent that picture via xbox messenger taunted by the person that kept killing them. The most i have seen someone stack a weapons dps is 90,000 so god knows how they are pusing it any further than that.
---
Perks and mutations to boost the damage:
---
-Demo Expert Lvl 5-INT perk
---
-Adrenal Reaction- mutation, more damage at lower health
---
- nerd rage lvl 3- INT perk, risky perk requires below 20% to activate damage
---
2nd. It seems like the Gatling laser doesn't Ash enemies as frequently as the laser rifle does, but good luck getting one that does useable damage. 
---
Bethesda really needs to add protection for our most valued items. Lost a explosive shotgun. Have not found another since.
---
That's a pretty neat detail.  It only makes sense, but I never would have thought it would actually work like that.
---
Im just wishing for 1 update. Seems like its been forever since we had an update
---
Bloody mess in luck will also add 15% damage
---
Both times I fixed it before the bot corrected me :P
---
What level does this perk show up? I've been playing for months but I'm only up to 40. I would absolutely love a cease-fire, even if it's not full comradery
---
plus, even if he *was* "one of the few", he's acting like Bethesda owe him a personal favor for doing so lol, and moreover that they would even see this post (I know they have *community managers* here but that's different from the guys calling the shots or doing the work, and it's unlikely one of those managers would pass on this particular post lol)
---
PC here Tex
---
If the intent was to avoid curb stomping lowbies it would have been good, but as people started to sort out ...... It was just bad nonsensical math. The same with slap damage kills which I still don't know how to do. :\
---
You might have fond memories of DS1 PVP but there are plenty of videos to review and the moment remastered hit Steam you could teleport and double backstab. Every mechanic in the game blown away by meta of whoever hits the frame first. It's lame. If you want to master frame execution go play Garou or GG. At least it's not random. ;)
---
You qint get banned for using mods
---
Okay. 
---
I can hear the banjos through my phone
---
So it's like real life radio? Cool
---
I mentioned downvotes once, and I wasn’t complaining.
---
I talk back but I've not heard them saying stuff like that. "Puny human" stuff but not any suicidal threats. 
---
The _’s aren’t necessary.
---
Which is a defect with the game. 
---
DISCLAIMER: This is my first negative comment about this game. I’m not a big fan of PvP, like the OP, I play solo. But nonetheless PvP is a total mess. 
---
I think it’s funny these people bought a game that has pvp in it and then cry that it has pvp in it lol
---
Saddly, no ;) it only pushes the passiv atributes the stats comes with.
---
pretty sure I met that person they asked me for ammo while aiming a gun at me and I burst out laughing 
---
I want the propane helmet as a craftable or lootable 
---
I have 18 tapes and the quest is still open. I have no idea if I should still keep it active or not...
---
Wait a damn minute. Where the hell did you find tent plans
---
I agree with you about the storytelling and world building.  I enjoyed 76 for those things.  But "being weak at the start" was really missing for me.  nothing killed me for a long time.  it was too easy in my opinion.
---
It's pretty funny that a perk or magazine mod changes the ammunition type. I guess we can't have different ammunition types any more. Today I gave two weapons magic armour-piercing magazines. The bullets wouldn't be AP if fired from a different weapon.
---
It gets even funnier with the magic effects of legendary weapons and armour.
---
I mean, I love it. But it's all pretty silly.
---
Out of curiosity, are you running Pharma Farmer?  I used to be able to hand out antibiotics and disease cure like crazy but as I shifted to a more damage-oriented and away from my "find stuff" perks I find myself running out of these fairly frequently (it doesn't help that antibiotics are bugged for crafting atm).
---
My theory is that you find a crappton more antibiotics and disease cure if you've got Pharma Farmer.
---
Some people have more spare time than others. Whats hard to believe about people playing the games they buy? If I had that kind of free time I'd probably be in the same spot.
---
Thats a good price man grab one if you don't have a copy.
---
It defenetly wouldn't be a bad mechanic if it wasn't spaghetti code.
---
And it's not fond memories it's current, there is quite a few groups dedicated to ds1 remastered PvP, it is mostly learning the tech. There is randomness sure but that's part of the fun. Tbh though none of the dark souls games are really meant for high level PvP, it doesn't have enough complexity to really bring much to the table
---
I can do you one better.   I was at the red rocket mega stop and it was unclaimed.  The was a scorchbeast in the area so I was constantly being bombarded by it.  I made my way inside to hide out for a bit. At some point while all of this was going on someone else came along and claimed the workshop.   So similar to OP, I picked a safe and got wanted.   I immediately ran away and fast traveled to my camp (literally on the opposite end of the map) to store my junk.   But it gets better.... I jumped server to join a friend so they could claim my bounty.   I loaded in and my camp was very near a group of people.   They immediately came after me,   Destroying a sizable portion of my camp in the process... just because they could.    
---
Perhaps even worse than this is that if you join a team and one person doesn't have pacifism  on, they can make your entire team able to be killed in pvp.  This is a fucking stupid design choice and one I abhor above all others.    Like OP said  IF I AM IN PACIFIST MODE,  AT LEAST WARN ME OF THIS SHIT.  Honestly pacifist sound just lock you out of doing anything pvp ish.   You want to lock pick something in an owned area?  It should act like it does if you encounter a level 3 lock with only 2 skill and pop a message stating that you need to exit pacifist mode to pick it.  Likewise,  if someone joins a team with a pacifist player it should lock the entire team out of pvp actions.   If someone in the team wants to pvp they can either leave the team or get everyone in the team to turn off pacifist.  I have lost so much stuff in nuke zones due to this, it's no longer funny. 
---
So many issues. Even when working right. If they’re spamming their sonic breath you can’t see shit and can’t aim, and there is no counter to this beyond blindly shooting. 
---
You can raise one special and choose a perk in another special category. Is that what you meant? Just hit the sort button to scroll through all perks available when you're at the level up screen.
---
For the "lifetime" of the character in 76 it's nice to be able to shift the build. It's not like you're going to restart on a new play though or similar and being stuck with a busted/worthless perk would be terrible. Level 50 one-point Respec is also much nicer to have than I thought it would be.
---
I mentioned the Gauss. The caps that increase range read "Default" and the default reads "Increases range". That just seems to be some flavor text added inconsistently which I think is also the explanation for Improved Armor Penetration, Superior, etc.....
---
900 is chump change try 90,000 lol.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a9ll8i/humor_how_can_i_get_the_damage_on_this_shotgun/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
I once met someone with a similiar name lol
---
If you go through the story a bit too fast you do encounter stronger enemies, or if you roam out of the forest too early. I remember getting stuck a bunch of times while leveling due to radscorpions, cryptids, scorchbeasts, etc.
---
buy the metal doors then use the dinner door with the broken glass then place a shotgun turret just behind it so it can see people doing the lockpick animation 
---
since the door is broken the turret can fire through it and as they go in for the lockpick they get shot several times in the face and activate the rest of the turrets 
---
meh - i have shit tons of ammo and stimpacks, and noone to share them with -_-
---
Hardly ever use any ammo except some shotgun shells or maybe some 5mm for a gatling, ive just stopped picking up 5.56 and everything else.
---
There is so much to this game too, take the time to read the lore. Actually stop and listen to the holotapes. They bitch about immersion and like you just said the bee-lined it too the end of the game without taking their time to appreciate the little things.
---
Ive been half assed trying to take notice of this. I havent noticed haha Does the in-game date really not change??
---
If not, do you think it ever will? 
---
For the longest time (if not still, but i think it has now) GTAO was in a perpetual state two weeks prior to the singleplayer story timeline. I wonder if well see something similar here, and as a new date comes about, well also see permanent changes to our environment.
---
FO4 was in a ridiculously rough spot at launch. Idk how you can say it didn't have issues.
---
Some of the bugs in FO4 have never been fixed, and they even carried over to 76 which kinda shows how much copy pasta Bethesda did.
---
I feel so ripped off by Bethesda. I do get my money's worth from their games, i love their games, spent hundreds of hours in Skyrim alone. But when you buy their brand new Fallout 76, and then a week later it goes on sale, what the fuck.
---
Meanwhile theres No Man's Sky which has stayed $59.99 since release and its already over a year old.
---
Tl;dr: OP outed themselves as an exploiter while trying the old stealth humblebrag
---
I'd rather a 2nd switch called Obey Laws or something along those lines even when I'm not in pacifist mode I often click on a chest not realizing its over lapped by something and see myself flagged a few moments later face palming  
---
when on it stops picking up any item that would cause a wanted tag - when off normal play this was people who want to run normal pvp don't accidentally flag themselves 
---
I have done it doesn't take too long. Prob about 3 or 4 hours. I got mine from watoga train station if that helps but I haven't seen them since despite a lot of server hopping
---
&gt; way off target
---
I always thought that it was actually right on target because the glowing sea was the pre war industrial and military heart of Boston?
---
Did they always stack? Cuz it didn't seem like it when I tried dit a while ago
---
Yeah, spamming the sonic attack is bullshit. Lvl 98 and I still hate these things. They constantly do that so I cant aim, and rarely land for me to melee.
---
Go back and scroll until you find the items marked with diamonds. You might have to scroll a little while 
---
Yes please!.
---
I have some atoms saved would totally grab that.
---
My issue with PVP is that explosive weapons exist, so if they have an explosive weapon they just need to fire 1 round near you and thats it for you.  
---
I tried to fight this guy a few days ago and everytime we actually came to fight, he just whipped out the explosive shotgun he had and wild fired it at me.  
---
He also somehow killed me in 1 or 2 shots when we werent hostile so slap damage just didnt exist at that point
---
 You get the plans after completing the Enclave questline [http://dulfy.net/2018/11/18/fallout-76-enclave-faction-quests-guide/](http://dulfy.net/2018/11/18/fallout-76-enclave-faction-quests-guide/).
---
I put Spotify on when I’m tired of the in game radio. My teammates can’t hear what I’m listening to, but they can hear me singing. So I’m sure it’s also an improvement for them
---
That would be /u/PussyslAerXx my man
---
Once you complete the enclave quest line, you can return to the bunker and get the schematics to build x-01 pa. I think it's one of the terminals in the military wing.
---
will be stalking and lurking about in 8-9 hours
---
It's probably a joke about how real life a lot of places close for new years
---
I like to punji board up all around the workbench and have a ring of missile turrets looking at it
---
Dense robot armour basically stops explosive damage you say....
---
wait until Bethedsa opens them back up.  they shut down nuke launching for new years.
---
You kinda have this Frank Griffin look ' on. 
---
I didn't know thanks a lot
---
Bruh, you gotta be 6'2" and bench over 200 to be alpha enough!  
---
Do you even lift brah?!
---
Seriously though, silos are closed for some reason.  People are speculating it's for new years whitespring parties to be peaceful or something.
---
Deathclaw hugs are just the best 👍🤪🍻

Finished US Army enlistment training so i have the Soldier Identification Card
---
This seems glitched. I have both ticket A4 and C43 in my possession, i used the terminal to start both B and C routines, went through the killing the ghouls including the hilarious ghoul simply named J47, when my number A4 or C43 is called the robot tells me to go sit back down and wait my turn. I can't get it to trigger.
---
So you dont get griefed by people running in front of your bullets and having you "start" a fight with them
---
it is a bp set learned at the end of &gt;!the enclave quest line, just interact with the computers in the final vendor room.!&lt;
---
It’s not the fact that they play that way . It’s the fact that they played for 200 hours and then feel they have the right to complain like they didn’t get their money’s worth lol
---
Have the exact same, even without demolition expert it states 648 dmg. 
---
Paper bags do disappear one you fast travel though. I try to make sure someone has heaved the stuff before I leave the area.
---
The .44 was like that in Fallout 4. You always found it as snub-nosed, but the default was the long barrel. The wording was confusing.
---
I do like being able to switch around the cards, and being able to change SPECIAL stats later seems to fit that well. Although I wonder why we can't switch to a lower version of a perk card if we need an extra point. I have 5 points of gun nut equipped because it slows weapon degradation by 50%, but I'm sure I could be happy with it at 30% and equip 2 more perk points.
---
I think its just location tbh. Ive never ran Pharma Farmer, but ive taken notice that certain parts of my aid tab are not as bulky as they were early on. 
---
Ive noticed that after traversing the greener portion of the map id have more of these items than id feel id ever need (until i go out of my way to really need them haha). I think missions/events/dailys also give you alot of that stuff, all without ant perk for it.
---
Pretty sure it was divby0 or some other Bethesdaism. At least that and the explosion invincibility bug is (mostly?) fixed. I'd like to hear the slap damage death explanation.
---
That was my point in bringing up Dark Souls. Multiplayer is core to that game (even passive via spell buffs and those crab thingers that didn't make it to DS2) and _required_ (forest, blues, etc). Ultimately, and especially in its age, some of the mechanics were wonky and "the tech" is just a different way to say "the input exploit everyone uses". In some games, those types of exploits are developed into mechanics and/or the game lends its own rules to not break under those mechanics. Plinking, block stun buffering, and even dust loops fall into those "evolving tech" categories. Teleport double backstab cyborg infinite throw, or slap damage death does not. :P
---
Considering the carry weight glitch and users being able to abuse that very early to break the balance of heavy ordnance ...... That's not tech or meta or skill or any of the above. That's just frustrating to everyone unwilling to do it. I've read Sirlin. I've watched the SF matches. I get it. ;)
---
Wdym, + two shot? As far as I know it’s not possible to add legendary modifiers on.
---
Exact same for me, including wondering if sludge lung is bugged
---
That is by far the most realistic quest in the game couldn't tell what was real anymore had to turn off the game and re-evaluate my life I thought watching the matrix trilogy on shrooms and acid was bad ... 
---
I've only met EU people in EU aside from when i invited my canadian friend to play. So you can definitely play cross-region, but i think it defaults to a s erver with low ping so you end up with europeans most of the time.
---
Oh hell yes, goodbye Spartan wood camp!
---
My bad, it's TSE. 
---
Those and some large containers with a working door too I've wanted to build a camp in them.
---
Wow, if you are ever selling it lmk!
---
Those mother fuckers drive me insane! Lookit here man, I'm just A single player that meanders about with no clue what I'm doing. Sometimes, though not often, I like to hit the links to try for a useful piece of gear. EVERY. DAMN. TIME. I spawn to the golf shack there's a rocket platform and a couple knuckleheads chew through enemies and sucking up all the gear. 
---
It just becomes not fun when they never land and spam the waves and poison when indoors.  I feel like I hacked a game and getting raped by unbeatable enemy.  I am a melee person 
---
If you ask nicely they might add it for you to buy 
---
Sadly, the only 73 year old Vietnam veteran I know is just racist, not a gamer. 
---
I feel awful too. Paid the full 60$ for the BASE game and now I see this!
---
Thought it would be too good to be true, still handy though, thanks for the info!
---
You can have lower versions of perks. For example, I have Traveling Pharmacy 1 and 3 for the exact reason you mention. If I get jammed up with stimpaks I can add 1 or drop a damage card for 3 points of weight reduction and fast travel.
---
..... You get quite a ton of stimpaks doing events. It's painful.
---
How did they take it away?
---
I think it has to do with the scenic photos achievement they put out a day or two ago.  One of the locations must be in a nuke zone.
---
I’ve got the outfit if you’re on PC. Need screws!! 
---
Made the silos inaccessible 
---
How? Just the elevator doesnt work?
---
A classic.
---
With the most amazingly terrible world generation times for the C64. So. Damn. Slow. 
---
Yes, this would prevent you from running through the silo to shot off the nuke
---
Did you buy anything nice?
---
My experience with the game is very similar with the only difference being that I am only lvl 70. After killing the scorched queen a few times, there is nothing interesting left to do.
---
He paid for the game, he has every right to demand the product he paid for is in WORKING ORDER.
---
This is exactly why companies don't fix things sooner and released unfinished products, people who believe in "gamer entitlement". In free to play games sure, but in a paid triple A game? 
---
Any clue why they did that? Is it permanent? 
---
Won't be home for a other 8 hours so have not seen the new items myself yet.
---
Or, give us a PA arm mod that allows a Power Fist to be worn/used when in PA.
---
Yah it's got a permanent price of $50 for the base game now but I'm alright with paying $80 at launch since I've gotten my money's worth and then some 
---
Believe it or not, you probably will get bored/annoyed with certain \*aspects\* of gaming. That started with me in my mid 30's, when I realized I no longer understood what half the shit kids "these days" were talking about. You'll get more selective, since your time will be more valuable, at the very least.
---
So you don't get booty blasted for firing an explosive weapon at a near people in Whitesprings.
---
Three stars too :) I'm a pistol stealth crit build, dont think I'll ever sell this bad boi ;)
---
I do need an instigating 10 mm or pipe revolver though for stealth... 
---
Looks great! Good job 
---
I am :)
---
Godless was pretty good. Bit the hat's kinda wrong for Frank Griffin.
---
It’s temporary. Apparently it was done to prevent white springs from being nuked for the bar meet up event inside the resort. 
---
Well that's pretty lame. I wonder if it's just a bug or on purpose. 
---
I've gotten sludge lung in the mire as well as swamp gas. Sluge lung after an enemy attacked me and swamp gas after hanging out in the water I think. Maybe it was just a toxic area. 
---
In case English isn’t your first language: Crashing/Server disconnects means he was playing the game, then wasn’t - not by his own choice - and it happened multiple times.

Imagine you’re driving your car down the freeway to work and then it shuts off. Then you restart it, but find yourself instantly 3 miles back from where you were. Imagine it happens 3 more times. Imagine it happens 20 times a day, and you paid for this car with the expectation that this wouldn’t happen. Imagine you’re not a fucking douche bag. Imagine.

I have over 200 hours in it but ive played almost every day, this is what gets me from this post  
---
&gt;Somewhere around level 50 I stopped playing for two or three weeks,   
---
The game has been out for (almost) 7 weeks and 2-3 weeks of that he hasnt even played, this means in the 28 days hes played he played it for about 7 hours a day
---
And holy shit, the fissure sites are sealed up too.
---
Try r/fo76bazaar  normally alot of trade going on all hours of the day.
---
That’s about 26 levels, which isn’t as bad as switching to shotguns.
---
As for legendaries, not a lot and nothing spectacular. One piece of Super Mutant armor, cloaking chest piece, my only 3* is reduced weight/+1 Agility/lower ammo weight. Oh, and a vampiric, VATS crit boosting Fatman. I regret the shit out of selling that low-level Ghoul armor. It was low level and that was before I understood the Whitespring situation.
---
If I go this route, I’ll start with the AG perks.
---
Thank you very much, this is a well thought out suggestion.

Wouldn't it have been easier to just remove white springs as a target for the event time? 
---
I'm already getting selective based on time. In the past if I saw a game I thought I'd like I'd just buy it. Now I think about whether I have time to pick up a new game or not depending on what I'm currently playing.
---
I'm probably kidding myself but I still feel fairly *young* at heart, I don't think I've lost track of what's going on in the gaming world within my own interests so I don't think I'm quite there yet.
---
Pretty much.
---
I have the full version of Travelling Pharmacy. I hope they fix it for RadAway soon. My STASH is too full to put anything in it that isn't junk.
---
Yeah, but why even do that? The bar is inside and nuke blasts do not effect anyone inside buildings. If anything it would have been better to get selfies with nukes in the background for New Years
---
I bought them they where fairly cheap the big tent is more expensive then the little one and can fit crafting stuff in pretty well one large tent for me holds a storage box , tinkers , armour and chem while a small one can fit like a chair and two sleeping bags 
---
Nah, his complaint doesn't make sense and the only douche I see is you kid. Go open your Christmas presents you pathetic child.
---
Actually yeah this is kinda cool, but not really modular so I doubt we will see it.
---
I love the BGM that's in the game, most of the time I have the radio off just listening to the game's ambient music.  But butcher Pete, aww yeah, I miss the second half of the song though which isn't in 76.
---
I wear the Civil War hat/suit combo for the Abe Lincoln look. I complete the RP by quoting other Presidents with my worst JFK accent. "Mistaaah xX420BlazeItXx, tear down this wall." 
---
Oh my! New outfits!! I thought it was the cappy shirt from the store.
---
I got the BoS engineer outfit, along with 3 others by joining the BoS!
---
Given the hours put in, OP probably didn't bee-line to the end of the game.
---
That's a formula a lot of people that get angry about video games don't get. If you're paying $60 for a game and done with it in 20 hours, you might be justified in feeling a little jilted, but it's three bucks per hour of enjoyment assuming it was a good game. With BGS games, that number is usually closer to $0.30/hr, or in many cases, $0.03/hr. At that point, how much can you \*really\* bitch about being ripped off?
---
spastic? no.  blazed? absolutely.

---
&gt; hat article especially is a trip. I commend you for actually reading that drivel as it was quite lengthy for what it sought to accomplish, which was to say "this game sucks".
---
I don't love the game. I would all it mediocre at best. Every criticism I have heard is valid. 
---
But how many ways can you say the same thing? 
---
Yes, the game sucks in a lot of ways. I understand saying that  upon the games release and for a while thereafter.  
---
I just find it incredibly bizarre that people are STILL spending crazy amounts of time talking about what a shit game Fallout 4 is and it seems  like they are taking the same direction with Fallout 76. 
---
I love to just put on the  “fallout radio” playlist on Spotify. 
---
I was having this problem for a week when loading in at my camp., I would have to open the map and fast travel somewhere as fast as possible before it crashed in order to continue playing.
---
I finally had to scrap/move my camp and so far it hasn't happened again 
---
Fresh level? Id be mad as fuck if all that i had just played had been for nothing..
---
I get sludge lung all the time in the ash heap.  Just go near any of the abandon mines.
---
It's on purpose and they were too fucking dumb to announce it pretty much anywhere but Twitter... And they offered absolutely zero incentive to do it
---
It’s free healing for me personally. I need to save all the stimpacks I have because I’m bad. 
---
Good lord, man. 
---
To be fair he never said he didn't get his money worth, he just said that he no longer wants to play the game, I too think it's ridiculous to say you didn't get your moneys worth at 200 hours but to be fair to op he never did say that
---
It does feel kinda retro doesn't it. And its a really cooool feeling.
---
This was more compelling a read than half the quests in the game. Have you considered writing for Bethesda?
---
That's sweet of you to offer. I'm doing really well on my second run through of the game. My only issue is that I like using rifles and can't seem to find much .308 ammo. I heard they nerfed that recently. I've been trying to use the crap ton of .38 ammo I have instead.
---
I do explore but i've avoided the bog mostly because of scorchbeasts. Fallout games have always had tongue-in-cheek references to aliens, ghosts, teleportation, time travel etc etc, making any of these into a major plot point would just be contrived and ridiculous imo.
---
Your speakers and your computer need to be plugged into the same outlet or surge protector/power strip.  Not doing this causes a potential difference from the signal input to the equipment ground that will cause humming or buzzing in the speakers.  
---
IF this is already the case then:
---
The buzzing could be from you having the speakers plugged into the wrong ports/hole
---
Just buy games that don’t have pvp if you don’t want pvp?

I cant upvote this enough...
---
Have it all part of the same STASH limit, whatever, but let ME sort shit..

Can confirm. You're in the BoS orange knight underarmor with a bomber jacket on. Oddly and fortunately it doesn't take up your underarmor spot.

Another of the entries describes the Grafton Monster:

Based on the success with AM52, we were confident in tweaking a few genomes for FEVS-006458.  
---
Unfortunately, the [subject](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Grafton_monster) grew too large to contain; the containment unit broke, but AM53 was unharmed. Indeed, despite this and its apparent lack of a discernible head, subject AM53 was surviving its metamorphosis, far exceeding our expectations.   
---
Since our containment units were insufficient to hold the subject, we have arranged for immediate transport off-site under sedation. Follow-up visits to AM53 will be scheduled for observation and recording. 
---
Maybe it's in-game lore explanation for the cryptids?
---
You should. It's part of the fun. 
---
There is an issue with Dropping Legendary Items, or anything with an Atom Shop Paint job, it gets permanently deleted, but should give you a warning first.
---
I don't think he's saying he feels ripped off or anything about enjoyment-time ratio. He's just saying he doesn't find the game engaging, simple as that.
---
Going through retailers; there are an awful lot of older games still sitting on $60 price tags even during the holidays, while it's easy to find 76 for $35
---
Hey buddy check out r/fo76bazaar its a sister sub for player trading. I believe another one is around as well fomarket or something.
---
OK yeah I get what you are saying. The thing about PvP though is a good game has it based on skill, COD, Battlefield, CS... Sure there are some unlocks which are OP in some games but generally you can pick up the starter guns and kick ass and take names if you have the skill.
---
In FO76 (and many other survival games) I can be as skillful as I want but my shotgun doing 85 points of damage can't compete with a TSE doing 700 and that means the higher gear people can just grief the lower ones without fear of repurcussion. That makes it broken. Fun PvP in FO76 should be stuff like the civil war fight but everyone gets issued a black powder gun. Even then my level 5 black powder can't really compete with a level 50. Or the school candy pinata thing.
---
Fallout 76 didn't NEED PvP. It could have been released as a PvE game or a CO OP game and it probably would have sold just as well because that's what the franchise is. Making it PvP makes it look like a 2016 cash grab. The only way it could be more obvious is if they did a battle Royale mode.
---
The game has PvP so unless they patch it out we do just need to deal with it, you are quite right. And labeling someone who wants to at only one aspect of the game an idiot is also not right. I will happily conceded to you both those points. 
---
Football matches last week. Not football matches two months ago or, in the case of Fallout 4, over two years ago.
---
Are you on PC?
---
not wanting to pop a bubble here, but we know about this easteregg since beta.
---
Probably. Honestly though I can't stand children like you.
---
Go to the Fallout 76 directory under your documents (C:\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76). Look for a Fallout76Custom.ini that you may have created previously. Make sure it contains the following entries:
---
**\[Archive\]**
---
**sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - ATX\_Main.ba2, SeventySix - ATX\_Textures.ba2**
---
If you do not have a Fallout76Custom.ini create one and just copy and paste those two lines into it. Without those two ba2 being loaded you wont see shop items.
---
That Outback weed must be some good shit  ;)
---
Fun Fact, you can build your base there, not far away is also a big cave you can build in.
---
Since when does robots party...but thanks anyway.. though i messed up the quest somehow
---
GET OVER HERE!
---
I also have spent a lot of time base building on FO4 Xbox and PC, FO4 has a ton of mods like Homemaker and DLC, you really can not fairly compare it to anything in FO76. 
---
Stormi, your build looks good and with budget limitations I think you did a great job with the furniture layout. Where did you find the Street Lamps plan? I wish we had some sort of spread sheet with all the build plans and description/images. I keep buying dupes. 
---
&gt;FO4 was in a rough spot at launch, not an unplayable rough, but plenty of crashes and bugs. Idk how you can say it didn't have issues.
---
No more than you'd expect from any other game: No game has a flawless launch.
---
&gt;Some of the bugs in FO4 have never been fixed, and they even carried over to 76 which kinda shows how much copy pasta Bethesda did.
---
Such as? Give us some examples.
---
He collects 200 Atoms.
---
I’m tired of fucking my girl after 1 hour .. nothing can stay fresh and fun if you do it for 200 hours 
---
Your point?
---
I appreciate the constructive feedback!
---
I think that’s reasonable and makes sense, but even without the legendary “explosive” trait, the typical laser rifle breaks exceptionally quickly. Now I haven’t exactly gotten it down to a hard science with data to back it up, but I think in comparison to other weapons that have a similar damage per shot range, the rifles still break more quickly.
---
All that being said, I imagine finding balance in a game like this is difficult and I don’t envy the devs  in regards to the problems they have to deal with, especially with fixing the PvP setup, duping, and the countless other stability issues.
---
See, what you do is make chocolate chip cookies, but put ONE raisin in each.
---
And when they get called out they get to make videos about how reddit is "attacking them", so they can get more views. These "news" sites and youtubers are clowns.
---
I wonder if we get them, you could build them in FO4, so its not far fledged to just import them.
---
Supposedly offline for new years so people can enjoy the Whitespring event without fear of nukes.
---
The only unfair advantage in PvP workshop fights is that a groupmate of the person who starts to claim your shop can pause the timer while being invulnerable to attack - and after a timeout the bar goes down in their favor regardless of the situation. 
---
I’ve fought people 100+ level beyond me constantly on my second character, all I do is PvP. Level has nothing to do with it. At the highest dps tiers the one shot is real, but you can mitigate this by playing smart. If I’m fighting multiple people or someone who can one shot I plan accordingly and that one shot becomes a 3-4 shot. Or, I get good, aim well, and play smart. 
---
This is the end of the world. Big fucks small, that’s life, and if you can’t figure out how to make it work then this is just the reality you’re going to experience. The game has multiple ways to even the odds, you just need to be aware of them. Scaling isn’t the answer in a game where everything is the same post 50. My 180 main has been killed by level 15s. It’s irrelevant. 
---
Można? Można ! A nie takie numery jak teraz -.-
---
I didn't do either.
---
I have the same problem. Have you managed to get around the issue?
---
Level 115.  Knew about these in workshops, did not know they were at the substations too.  Thanks OP.
---
I noticed it last comment. I still stand by my dick comment though lol.

And you have to realize we aren’t on fo4

Tis a very good start for you. :)

We have a guitar in a tent

You can have a seat if you prefer.

I'm not sure about Heat Flashes or Swamp Gas, but I assume the latter is associated with the Mire and maybe infected creatures over there.

Never realized this while roaming the wasteland.

YOU just learned me some new insights.

Building at the most toxic spot on the map. Brave.

 Rather than putting a protected zone they take then offline :(

*wooshing intensifies*
---
And here is my #GIANT ALARM CLOCK
---
Can you build right next to one? Also do I need to attach wires from the outbox
---
Yeah absolutely, there’s even a quest you get from Rose where you befriend a deathclaw, I guess since Bethesda removed all human npc’s they let us be friends with the wildlife :)
---
pfft
---
Yeah ahha would make sense right instead of taking offline the end game activity lol.
---
TO THE PLAAAAAAAACE!!!!!
---
&gt;If anything this game has too restricted of PvP considering the method of initialization.
---
agree with this boomer here. hell i would love if they added drop gear(when you die in pvp) so other players could take. they could add perma death to.
---
but allas they have to milk carebares somehow.
---
TO THE PLAAAAAAAAAACE!!!!!
---
65" 4k and I sit maybe 8' from it, there are still times where the font seems tiny

I understand and respect that.

Some great info thanks. I'll try those out later.
---
Reddit is fickle as fuck.  I still can't understand why people didn't like my "mutation that just gives you a big butt" suggestion.
---
Its funny, too, because I had a reached a point in my long exploration session that it was beginning to weigh on me. Its a testament to the environmental storytelling that this game can drain you emotionally. Its like watching the best episodes of Walking Dead in that way. 
---
But that session came shortly before I logged out for the day. And it left me with a really good feeling. An upbeat, positive vibe that the game does not always impart, due to its bleak atmosphere. It was a welcome respite from the Wastes and I hope you, and others, provide many more.
---
In fact, I have now been inspired to begin serious base building based on this encounter. I want to help provide those same experiences. Now, I just have to figure out how to make a base with a an upstairs section wider than the downstairs, because I have no clue...

well it always is hard to judge end game when starting out for a online game of any kind 
---
like Fortnite Save the world (not the other mode...) its 1+ year in and the end game content is roughly the same as publish simply because it was never expected for people to play so much and reach the end so fast 
---
I can even say how many games I've seen this in though which is why I personally play a kind of online game rotation of 2-4 online games to give them time to grow and change 
---
Well either it bugged or its on you and you didnt notice it. 
---
Also ctd like all the time. 
---
yes, and yes.
---
It really stupid considering we launched one at 0015 gmt... 
---
[https://i.imgur.com/1F8gw3T.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/1F8gw3T.jpg)
---
pretty much sums it up
---
the love for this game is a bit over the top, too.
---
Its a daily quest and returns everytime you log in if you have a certain criteria 
---
A.) near wendigo spawn
---
B.) sight wendigo
---
C.) have or have had clown apparel
---
Never saw the point of the munitions factory. I've got ammosmith maxed, wind up dropping/giving away thousands of rounds that I'll rarely use.
---
There’s only two things that make you wanted in this game. What more of a warning do you need?
---
Kill a kid who isn’t attacking you? Wanted. 
---
Steal or Destroy someone’s CAMP or Workshop stuff? Wanted. 
---
That’s it. If you’re worried about it, don’t fuck around in people camps or workshops. You didn’t need that safe in the factory, you wanted it. In the real world or in a post apocalyptic universe, you don’t know what belongs to who and you’d find yourself in the same situation anytime you were scavenging around where you shouldn’t be. 
---
If you get a wanted level just travel to some players. They’ll kill you, or you can ask them to. A few hours of frustration over a 10 cap wanted level is absurd. Try 3.5 hours of 50% damage penalties lol. 
---
ahahah welcome to club.
---
Raiders in a fallout game? No way 
---
Go to

Pipboy
---
Events (or daily / side)
---
Go to Misc. 
---
scroll down once in Misc. 
---
Find the mission uncheck it, this mission will pop up and vanish immediately from now on
---
Of course its are fucking kids ..
---
I've been wanted for like a week. 10 caps for accidentally shooting a guy's stuff while killing supermutants. I'm apparently too high level for people to get motivated enough to murder me. So without a way to clear my bounty, I suppose I have to raise it enough for people to hunt me down.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG6DifUtPvs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG6DifUtPvs)
---
a lot of it seems to be duping causing crashing and server hoping to look for items so if they fix those 2 things it would make server stability increase as well 
---
While being hit by slap dmg you can fast travel still.  Just go to vault 76 for free or your camp if the fight is taking place away from it.  If they follow you to 76 then head back to camp and vice versa, they'll continually burn caps just trying to chase you.
---
Someone doesn't want to be on Atom's good side

Do you mean your penis? I would enjoy that. You are in San Francisco right?

She probably didn't spend hours making meticulous CAMPs, didn't stop to loot every battered clipboard and desk fan she ran across, didn't stare at length at her Pipboy trying to figure out what perks and cards to get next, and didn't start each day picking crops, getting water, cooking food, playing instruments, taking a nap, equipping the right guns and grenades, making ammo, and then making a circuit of every vendor scrabbling for caps.
---
at  least ur junk collerctor reapired.
---
Ooo i know my vent became a rally point for all of us angry at it.
---
It does lol
---
I didn't knew aboug ghis until level 45 when i started question myself why i can't find any legendary items with more then one stat.
---
It’s too small :(
---
And you are 26? I like them young
---
Last night there was a level 14 at WS during a nuke ghoul run. He was spraying explosive weapons into the ghouls and hitting our team too and hitting others as well. His name tag became red. I saw him go to his knees. I had pacifist on but decided to help his death along, swung at him once with my sledge. He died.
---
He comes back in a minute with a high level character and a few friends and now they're chasing me around killing me over and over again. Until my friends catch on and kill them. 
---
I wouldn't mind as much if it was called "Early Access".  Dupers gotta go though, they are what is crashing the servers.
---
38 and I identify as a pot roast so please use pronouns like beef or crust

"The whole ordeal involving the Nuka Dark Rum is such a non-issue" "That said... the issue surrounding the bottle is ridiculous" ......This post is a mess.

Put your beef into my crust
---
GT? I may need a couple if you ever get a surplus and want to sell.
---
Then learn how damage mitigation works or don’t engage in PvP. I run full weightless trash armor and the one shot is rare. If it happens I make adjustments. 
---
Ahh. Fair enough.
---
Haha there it is!
---
Outstanding 
---
Rather just have text chat like many here keep suggesting lol.
---
I could whisper them how much i love their layout and then maybe chat about items used.
---
It's not, I just checked.
---
Should be fairly easy to do, would like to see some compact work benches to go with them too.
---
it's amazing how out of touch they are with their own playerbase.
---
what people want to do with their time off? lounge around in a dead virtual bar, of course!
---
I read that increasing explosive resistance helps reduce damage from scorchbeasts. I wear my chest like that and it seem to help. 
---
Delicate server issue... &gt;&gt;&gt; Eve Online LOL
---
Overall I would appreciate some kind of UI enlarge 
---
So that's where my PA mods went I thought they just disappeared cause the game but this is good to know.
---
Okay, so..let's destroy people's camps like for no reason 5yo kids. 
---
The Ink Spots said once: "I don't want to set the world on fire". But some players want only this :)))
---
Only another anecdotal reddit post lol
---
But worth a try?
---
This exact same thing happened to me- picked a lock in a workshop (that I didn't even realize was in a workshop.  Also, this wasn't a container that the owner had placed).  
---
Eventually a level 29 player ran up behind me and smashed my level 5 head in for the 10 cap bounty.
---
It did not add to my enjoyment of the game in any way.
---
Not sure how to do that but it sounds like a good idea. Any guidance on that?
---
haha I gave some random guy a bunch of nuka quantums I had from a trade last night and the dude message me all happy, definitely nice to help some peeps out.  I try to drop a serum here and there from time to time or drop plans that I accidentally buy that I already had; it's always funny to watch how the people handle that stuff. 
---
Most annoying was him blocking me and my husband so we couldn't get back at him. 
---
If you or someone requested a supply drop its a limited time event not quest.
---
You are only meant to own x1 legendary item of each category, any more an our collective Moms will be screaming...
---
'Clean your room'!!
---
Yeah, it's essential for any sort of group combat (end game), but it's really half assed the way they implemented it.
---
Just today got notice that a workshop I had got claimed by someone else. I go there, got one-shotted by chameleon guy with explosive weapon. I'm lvl 120. Not even a fight.
---
Wasn't the first time. I will never defend a workshop again, thats how griefing works now.
---
My behavior has nothing to do with it. Haven't had an interaction with this player before or any other on this map. The player already had 2 other workshops on the map, presumably taken from other players the same way.
---
To see the griefed player's behavior at fault is quite frankly a little insult-ish. A lot of us have been griefed.
---
Yes it is. Either that, or killing a wendigo in a clown costume is now a daily quest.
---
Grognak's Axe can't be "over-repaired" either. Only goes max 100%
---
&gt;grenades and stimpaks
---
 very good advice
---
Or keeping the perk as it benefits grenades and already existing explosive weapons, remove the Legendary effect from the table/existing weapons and making mods for all non already explosive weapons that allows them to fire explosive rounds.  You could then change modded weapons to be considered explosive weapons instead of their normal type; so for example, an Explosive Shotgun would benefit from Explosive Expert but not Shotgunner.  This would then limit the effectiveness of Explosive weapons based on how much ammo you have for them and would add some more ammo types/playstyles to the game.
---
Of course Dupers could just dupe their ammo and still run around with TSE 1 star weapons, so it doesn't actually fix anything.  But it is an interesting idea.
---
A weapon to surpass metal gear
---
blame the developers who have not addressed the duping in months.
---
That's a great story but it would not have ended as well had you not been able to communicate with him. Half the time I play the other guys are not on area chat. Using auto, area, nothing works, they're on discord because area chat doesn't work half the time, so few people communicate, and just so many missed opportunities 
---
I have a lot of game crashes over the last 3-4 days.  Previously it had only been server disconnects, but now the client locks up.
---
This also happened to me! I was hanging out inside for the bar thing, nobody was there so I was leaving and walking down the stairs killed me. 
---
Lol.
---
Thats what i thought at first. "Where do i find a wendigo wearing a clown outfit?"
---
Has anyone seen a weapon with more than 3 stars?
---
And I don't mean adding the anti-scorched effect to a 3 star weapon.
---
Well, I did figure a way to make it work. Perhaps it wasn't conventional, but as you say, that's life.
---
I like PvP. I just think that one-shot mechanics shouldn't be a thing, in any game. It's boring for the guy one-shotting, and frustrating for the one being killed. A truly fun and engaging PvP experience requires that both parties have time and means to react to an attack. 
---
I wish you could leave a bread crumb of notes around the map, similar to Dark Souls, for other people to read.
---
Should not be an issue all you need to do is get close to a deathclaw and then she speaks. Telling you it was a joke and now you better run or kill it.
---
If thats not the case try jumping servers if it is still not working. Submit a ticket and explain the issue as it means its bugged for you.
---
Ugh these comments are so annoying and exhausting 
---
There’s no end game, get over it 
---
I don't think you read what I wrote.
---
Rose is finicky. 
---
I've had this happen, but the Deathclaw's body was sucked back into the hell it came from and resulted in silence. 
---
I jumped server, did it again. Nothing. 
---
Third time is a charm, I suppose. So once more, I server bounced and tried and finally, after killing the Deathclaw at the designated place and looting its corpse, Rose started to speak. 
---
PC, Mx7733, keep getting disconected. First "controles disconnectd" then "disconected from server" unplayable
---
Its been asked for since the get go and hopefully we will end up getting this option.
---
I feel your pain as I've spent countless time and resources to fight the SBQ only to recover the loot once in 10 tries over the past couple days.
---
I started this game with 9 friends, 1 comes on a couple times a week the rest are just done.
---
Ridiculously petty that this is what you took issue with. 
---
Tested this today and yeah. I got wanted to. Had no idea that was a thing. I guess once a workshop is claimed EVERYTHING is considered owned. Apologies. You were right. 
---
I got wanted for the first time yesterday. I think i picked a locked door that was within an owned workstation, but im not sure. It would be nice to at least know what made you wanted.
---
How about a nice game of chess?
---
1. It does all loot does just click (r) (pc).
---
2. A highly good idea on the master suggestion list is for them to add different variations of bags that can be purchased on the atom store.
---
I've been playing since BETA and I have found exactly one exploding weapon... A gatling gun. Ghoul slayers. It's not a two shot. It's deadly enough for me. I have a few two shot non exploding weapons. They're pretty cool.
---
Haven't found a tse in game yet. But everyone seems to have them. 
---
I hear what you’re saying. However, you do have time. If you are attacked first you have all the advantage, as your first attacks will be the ones to connect at full damage. Workshop capture wise, you have to remain aware that when someone hits claim you are immediately a target. 
---
More often than not when you go into PvP you had time to adjust for it. At a workshop If you die you have plenty of time to spawn, adjust and attack. 
---
The only change I think is really needed at this time besides the group capture issue, is with defending your workshop. The attacker should have to sit in the radius provided, but you should be able to cap your base back, while it’s yours, from anywhere in the workshop. This would force the attacker to seek you out, and remove the disadvantage you have defensively of have to sit in the open in a 5 meter bubble. 
---
Other players exploiting the game is the cause of the crashes.
---
The tip which works for me on ps4 is to stay absolutely still (touch nothing) for about 30s after you fast travel in, gives it time to load and can usually avoid a crash.
---
For the previous challenge, only a "Bowler" worked, not a "bowler hat"
---
Im 27. He sounded like my father. I assumed he would be in his mid 50s, but said 40s to be conservative. theres no reason to be patronizing 
---
O i know salt lol see just above my reply to the other comment and check out my thread i linked.
---
It might make ya extra salty salt though lol..
---
Just a refresh. I bought the T-60 Jetpack Plan from the BOS vendor just this morning.
---
Cheers mate! Loved fallout 4, understood it! Haha this is just taking a while to adjust 
---
Have not seen this posted before are you able to rejoin the same server through recent played players?.
---
Also have you tried repairing your game on the Beth app page.
---
Ya i do that. I even hold my breath and she still crashes. And it seems to be this area which crashes me all the time other places are not as bad. Does your game fully freeze and then start going after 30 seconds or is it still running while it is loading?
---
Np its what the community here is for, to help.
---
To the place, I belong!
---
No, i think the 4th and 5th star is currently unused and probably reserved for something like the vaults.
---
I could try rejoining. Ya i did the game repair/verification.  Says it's good to go. 
---
Yeah definitely an item to pass on if your a collector. Probably fine if your an alcoholic buut probably not for a Fallout collector.
---
&gt;Maybe when you've got a group of your friends things are a little more exciting
---
Got bored in a multiplayer game by doing everything solo? You don't say...
---
There's an event?
---
This is a really wierd one man and might require ya to submit a ticket and get help from Beth support.
---
The rejoin thing is to see if it wad a server crash or if its just an issue for you.
---
Whitespring event??
---
Also - Yea, I cant even get into the silos
---
Yeah...and I don't understand people who think they're going to find that one game to play for the rest of your life.  Did you get $60 worth of entertainment out of it?  if you played 200 hours then hell yes you did.  Just move along, there's no reason to shit on the game.
---
Well, I don't have weapons capable of one-shotting, so I'm at a disadvantage there. That's why I say that this mechanic shouldn't be present.
---
Even if I killed him, you know what would happen next. He would seek revenge, and one-shot me while sneaking. Then I do the same, and again, and again... Wouldn't it be much better if we both could engage in PvP without having to rely on "I attack first = you die"?
---
This way, skill comes into play, and if there's a clear winner then the other starts thinking if it is worth it to keep coming back.
---
Shadowed, Deep Pockets and Ultra-Light are the 3 that typically need plans to unlock.  You can very rarely and for unknown reasons unlock them from scrapping, but usually it's better/easier to just find the plans.
---
Haha yeah good question since they did not say bugger all in game... so if you don't check their twitter feed you probably would miss it.
---
&gt; If you view it in your inventory, it'll only tell you one.
---
You need to look at it properly to see the full list of effects.
---
What exactly does this mean? How do I look at something properly?
---
Wait is there an update? With notes on this?
---
Ah gotchya. Ya not a server crash in this case. Just the regular crash.
---
Melee weapons can one shot people since beta, nerf those too. You dont even need a good legendary to do that as melee.
---
Yup they thought it was a good idea to announce it via twitter and not in game lol.
---
Well, you shouldnt have any problems waiting another day then.
---
Yeah so your only choice now is to submit a ticket into them and give as much detail as possible man.
---
Sorry all the help i have left for this. 
---
... And a deathclaw spawn inside the fence 
---
Then why make it multiplayer at all?
---
So far it just seems like it's entire point is so people can buy shit off the Atom store and show off how much money theyre blowing on the game to other people? 
---
Huh?
---
They'll only ban you if you use mods that give you some sort of advantage in PvP. Not QoL mods
---
But they'll eventually get what they need quicker and overall there will be less server hoping.
---
R for PC, Square for Ps4 and X for Xbox
---
If your name is similar to "cupcake"?
---
Ya probably the best plan of action. Thanks for the advice! 
---
troll
---
My favorite is my Ultracite, but it's like a Sports Car to me. I'm lvl 56, but I still use my lvl 35 excavator because it's a damn fine work horse. That extra 100lbs of carry weight makes it very useful, and while not offering premiun protection... it's not bad.
---
Also asmall QoL that I would like. Can we get a "sort recipes by ingredients please?" 
---
Completely minor, I know.
---
Np man we all do our best to help each other.
---
He's soooo wasted.
---
Yeah sure, that's why I heard some guy using graphics mods got banned. Nice try trolls
---
That is a pretty creepy screenshot lol...
---
On PS4 press r3 and “view” the item to see the extra effects.
---
&gt; environmental storytelling and worldbuilding, and they delivered in F76 as much as their previous titles IMO.
---
Teddy bears in positions or doing human things isn't environmental story telling. You're giving Bethesda too much credit.
---
I pick flowers too. By my experience, there are only 11 raw cobalt flux in whitespring. 
---
I've met people named things like that far to often in mmo's 
---
The sounds creepier, millions of purifiers sucking in water at once
---
She made mad caps by being an overseer and just fast travels everywhere duh 
---
While it doesn't really work on the munitions factory or other indoor workshops like the food plant over by Flatwoods, I'm a big fan of taking workshops back via artillery. If I get run off I'll setup camp nearby with a few artillery and start bombarding. If I can't have those resource extractors I'll make sure there's nothing left to extract with.
---
Are nails even in fallout 76? Unless you mean you want them added for a weapon (nail gun) in which case I'm fully onboard. As for crafting gears though I'd rather not. They're not that hard to get so I don't see a reasons to be able to craft a crafting material
---
Thread updated.
---
I just defended that factory.

I'm almost level 50 and only found this out yesterday, lol. Good PSA, wish I'd seen it before. Most of my legendaries have only been 1* but I know I sold a few 3* which didn't appeal, d'oh! I'm still wearing level 5 leather armour because I haven't found anything else I can add pockets to with the legendary perks I like, he he. 
---
O i reckon they will man, creation club will probably be the mod support for 76. That way they can make sure their profits are not effected by free mods.
---
I meant screws lol
---
Repost please
---
Hahaha yeah it would lol 
---
Best place is always here.

---
The moment they are cracked they are up.
---
I don't care what you play lol, I was just objecting to being called lazy because I don't play the same.
---
Crap! Thanks for posting this, I had a cowboy pistol I thought was glitched because the name didn't match the effect. It was a 3 star so it must have been one of the hidden ones. Really bummed I got rid of it now... :(  But ty for posting this so I don't do that again 
---
I'd buy this if you were ps4
---
Oh screws aren't that hard to get either. Just grab desk fans. Springs are the real nuisance but personally I don't really want to be able to build crafting materials. 
---
Thank you. I'm getting bored running around...
---
Why are they so cheap is it because the bad reviews? Game seems good to me minus a bit buggy at times. 
---
So THAT's why they exist. They are otherwise very pointless locations.... 
---
No problem my man its what the community is for.
---
I tried this with a deathclaw.
---
Note: Do not trust everything Rose says.
---
I have 2800 hours in Borderlands 2 and still enjoy it. I have 250 hours in 76 and I am sick of it. Nothing else to do. And the game itself is too buggy and the disconnects too frequent to let me enjoy the only semi exciting things like nuke runs. And the social menu is jacked so it's a lot of work sometimes just to get in a team. It's hit or miss with this game as to whether or not you even get a chance to play with or without friends. Not much fun at this point. 
---
You're sort of becoming a troll in these threads. 
---
You need starched Gene's lvl 2 (3?) It let's you recover all rads with no chance of removing mutations
---
Play Skyrim again!
---
I used someone’s camp the other day and dropped some ammo in the corner as a thank you 
---
Oh! I'm on PC, so does that mean that everything would show up normally for me, or do I also need to do something extra to view the other effects?
---
i just went to the mentioned bar 
---
no ingame event or anything special there  
---
might be just at their mentioned time, but dunno why nukes must be disabled the whole time instead of just when this event took place
---
Yea on Christmas Day me and my friends set a camp up by the overseers camp and gave all the new players coming threw some basic items to help out was a lot of fun doing it too we were all in clown out fits and one buddy would go and lure them to more clowns they probably thought rape but then just  got free shit. 
---
You can get a two shot explosive weapon drop. It's one of the most valuable loot items in the game.
---
Just because it happened to him 10 times doesn't mean he played no role. Dude also edited his posts to appear less defensive than that currently reads. 
---
This area is one of the worst for me. Sometimes it will fully freeze then recover some time later, other times its running but at about 5fps or something. 
---
What platform are you on?
---
For PC it's X. He's telling you to inspect the items.
---
You talking about legendary armor? Cause if so, it's known. It's also the reason that assassin's sentinel/cavalier goes for 10-15k plus, 20 sometimes. It's also near impossible to find. With that you can actually get complete immunity to damage. If you're talking about something involving dodgy, it doesn't work well against rapid fire TSE guns. Getting hit quickly just empties your AP and leaves you more vulnerable. If you've come up with something else I recommend not telling anyone and buying everything related off the market before the price skyrockets.
---
I have played since beta. I have not bee lined to the end and I have listened to the lore. I took my time. There's nothing left to do and the game is absolutely flooded with tse weapons which is annoying as fuck. It's a train wreck since day 1 
---
But the real question, do you ever suffer from dehydration?
---
PC 
---
You should know now that lawn decorations are dangerous things in 4 and 76. You turn your back on your gnomes and BAM your garden has a fresh body in it. Walk away from your flamingo? Well, hope you didn’t like your stuff cause she’ll burn it to the ground to get your attention back. 
---
Watch yourself out there. Because they’re watching you.
---
Thank you! I had no idea. :]
---
Depends on your build.  If you rely on VATS, use a weapon with a high VATS cost, have low/min agility &amp;/or can't fit Class Freak 3 into your build, then you should avoid it.
---
Same. I built a new computer for this game. Joke's on me, game still looks like shit 
---
I don't know how you made it to 120.  All these problems become apparent at level 40 or 50.  Last night was the last straw for me.  After soloing my way to my first nuke, the server crashes during the fight with the Queen.  I'm done.  I told myself I'd finish the story and explore the map (basically play the game like any other Fallout, only without the interesting characters and quests) and then put it down.  Well, I finished the weak storyline and I've seen everything worth seeing on the map.  Bon voyage.
---
Even then that rum is overpriced. 
---
It would have been easier if they let us vote for or at least the other designs.
---
Spent about 4 hours in white springs last night on xbox one farming high level ghouls and a level 40 grafton monster that kept spawning. This was just a normal farm, no one nuked anything. 
---
Server crashed 4 times in the 4 hours. I am also past level 50 but cant beat the game due to the game crashing everytime i launch a nuke on fissure prime.
---
I imagine that will come with the next content update. Like a boss in the vaults.
---
If we can craft railway spikes then why not.
---
This. Mods ruined Bethesda games like Fallout and Skyrim in the past. (Sarcasm).
---
But harassing people isn't interesting PVP, especially kiling a low level poor guy again and again.
---
I can confirm you are only able to join friends on PS4 as well, I've tried joining after disconnecting from a nuke zone a couple times.
---
Half of the guns suck or are broken. Welcome to beta.
---
We spent the evening playing together as have 2 PS4s... do I win?
---
2800 hours!?!?!?!??!!?!?!?  That’s almost 3/4 of the work hours I needed for my apprenticeship. Holy fk man .. 2800 hours?!?!?!? 
---
Just equip the home defense 2-3 perk
---
Can you launch a nuke ? Can’t access silo
---
That was mostly fake news though... Did you read the article?
---
They're building up to explaining to OP why the game being boring to them is their fault.
---
dead game
---
A consumer always has the right to complain about a product they purchased. Always.
---
I would say yes!
---
But there were no other "lesser" designs. That's some cheap plastic crap and a cheap glass bottle under it. It is most likely the bag situation again, but they know how people will react if they admit it.
---
You first need to select the “Transfer” button, then select the option “Take All”. 
---
Hope this helps!
---
Empathy is actually really good if playing with others.  With Class Freak 3, you only take 8% more damage and with Strange in Numbers your teammates take 31% less.  This stacks for each person in a group, so that 2 people with these skill will each be taking 23% less damage.  3 people would be taking 54% less damage, and a 4 person group would be taking 85% less damage, each(which should be the cap for damage reduction IIRC).
---
Game was marketed for longevity. Nobody should get bored of games of service.
---
It's just that in Fallout 4 you can mod the game six ways to Sunday. So many game play mods you can play an entirely different game every few days if you want to. With so many new items and weapons and you can change the weather or ride a motorcycle... 
---
It's hilarious watching people make measurements of when it's acceptable to complain about a product you purchased.
---
Except we shouldn't need a work around
---
Hmm...nah let's play global thermonuclear war again. Pretty sure I got the right strategy this time.
---
I wish I had rented it instead of paying full price. The CONSTANT DISCONNECTS alone are enough to warrant hating this game right now 
---
What a completely strange thing this weapon is! 
---
I got NMS a few weeks ago for like $20 on sale, but yah, I don't see them dropping the base price. I've gotten enjoyment out of it, but not $60 worth
---
Ah man nevermind, I wanted to be nice and respond from similar, RP oriented perspective, but let me be straight now.
---
You are putting yourself at such a severe disadvantage that calling it lazy is indeed inappropriate. You are not lazy, you are misinformed and set on remaining misinformed as, as it appears, you are roleplaying part of misinformed faction which ignorance led to its demise in west virginia. While I 100% agree that you are free to define how you want your playtime to be played, this also means tha tyou are free to decide that you will play it in a misinformed manner, purposedly ommiting game mechanics that are both most fun and most strategically important, and thats okay too.
---
But you know what else this is to me, besides stubbornes and selective perception? To me its not finishing your homework in the single cool subject in the curriculum. And to me thats lazy.
---
My initial point was to provide strategic information which I believe is of utmost importance. You instead choose to focus on the "lazy" word, and ignored the value behind the advice from level 160 both PvE and PvP oriented player. I do believe that the way by which you digest information is lazy.
---
Your position in the food chain is either loot or food. I intented to help alleviate you - and other players - above that position where they are consumables for other things in the wasteland. But feel free to remain earthbound, if that is your will.
---
Begone Troll. I'm disabled. I also have 3000 hours in Fallout 4. Eat your heart out. 
---
Take a selfie there for atoms i believe still at work so can't check for abit.
---
I'm going to try here in a  second i just have to store some junk and weapons really quick. I'll let you know 
---
Be Batman.
---
Are you using power smith perk? It reduces the materials needed
---
I should put my flamingo in a fireplace, so it can suffer for eternity.
---
What platform are you on? Because the servers are divided by platforms. Are you on PC, Xbox, or Ps4? 
---
You know I've met a few new people on this game that are now part of the crew. Human nature is to help the tribe.
---
Ps4 lol
---
What mats are you missing to make it?.
---
Also do you have the perk to make it alot cheaper to make on?. Also reccomend the perk to craft it to 200% durability.
---
Is it possible to mod Fallout 76 like in Fallout 4? Or are there at least confirmed plans om making the building more attractive? 
---
Class Freak 3 negates Barbarian and Evasive even if you don't have any mutations or effects that increase/decrease your Strength/Agility.  So the bug isn't associated to having Herd Mentality or effects that increase/decrease your Strength/Agility.
---
Class Freak should be avoided if you are using Barbarian/Evasive for DR/ER(at least until they fix this issue, assuming they ever do), and if you are running 15 Agility with Evasive, you can have Scaly Skin without it hurting much, since you alreay had a lot of AP anyway.
---
No it is for you though. They get all the stuff back, and you look like a pathetic grown ass man preying on children for fun.
---
Multiple codes in quantum superposition 
---
Im pretty sure, I traded for all the mats before, so, Idk
---
I wouldn't mind sporting the Doom Marine armor lol
---
less raider and more 14 year old with a two shot explosive weapon and a god complex
---
Yeah trying to beat down the durability to repair.
---
Yes I have oy maxed out
---
Why not tell them?.
---
Be a good sport and help your fellow vault dwellers. :)
---
Ooo i am sure alot of us would lol and the BFG.
---
I think it's X on PC
---
I jave power smith maxed out
---
Also make sure not to keep it on. You only need it to build the turrets then you can take it off and still keep them.
---
Thingamabobs?  I got twenty.  But I want mooooooore!
---
Also the same people who made the burned man short film are starting to crowd fund their next one about legate lanius. So maybe 2021? 
---
I'd lose my shit if they added the Praetor armor. I mean, why not. They have other things. I don't want to hear the argument of breaking immersion. This is the Wacky Wild Wasteland we want and need.
---
I wasn't being patronizing. 
---
cooperation is what has kept me going. I joined the united brotherhood BoS discord server, we have missions (outside of the game, stuff you do for fun), roleplay, a few people to hang around with.  
---
im currently collecting 50 100% fusion cores, holding all 3 power plants and trying to find 5 sets of t60 power armor to show my commander that we can gear the knights up again.  
---
is it minmaxing? of course not. but its fun, its a goal. and having a goal in an rpg is what i think this game is lacking in endgame content. theres no faction system to grind for unique rewards, nothing to do besides what you come up with. legendaries are random, boring and frustrating. theres no dungeon content, besides silos if you would call them that.
---
Hi all,
---
To clarify, there is/was no in-game Whitespring event. The tweet was specifically to encourage people meeting up and taking photos at the Whitespring together and sharing them to celebrate the New Year. 
---
Regarding the provided screenshot from u/TheMadVanguard, could you let me know what platform you're on and what time you saw this happen so I can pass that along to the team looking into issues? 
---
Thanks in advance!
---
Happy new year buddy try r/fo76bazaar .
---
Are they still off?
---
I tear their camps down. Fuck those guys 
---
It currently isn't that bad. When it was released it was pretty bad. 
---
How much purified water do you get from each one per hour? Did they fix the purifier bug or can you still only produce a maximum per hour?
---
I'm running into this issue currently. Anyone found a fix?
---

&gt;This whole sub bends over and presents their ass to bethesda, coming up with ANY reason they can to say how good Beth are and how they deserve all of our money.

Not seeing it; at any given time, about half the posts on the front page are "why I'm quitting" or "Bethesda, fix this!" posts.

Do you use the revolver pipe rifle?

There are certain mods that give a weapon a *. Allowing for 4* the machete is the most  common one.

Happy new year Jess.
---
So stopping the nukes was not intentionally done?. It seemed like it was done for the Whitespring new years i guess photo gathering. 
---
So that's where all my mods went 
---
I can deal with clipping and sub-par graphics.  I can no longer deal with abysmal gunplay and clunky combat, not when your whole game revolves around those two things.  It was passable in Skyrim because that's mostly just melee combat, but as soon as you introduce guns into the equation it becomes super apparent how archaic the engine is.  When you have to build an auto-aim feature into your game because combat is that sloppy, there's a problem.  It gets to a point where I'm not just fighting enemy AI, but I'm actively fighting against the game's engine, too.
---
If animations are still this stiff and unresponsive, where I feel like my character is constantly underwater, in Starfield and ES6 then those games are going to be hard passes for me.  There's other studios out here making the same kinds of games but better, I'll play their games.  Bethesda has been coasting on goodwill for a while now but they lost it all with 76.  Time to step up to the plate or go home.
---
My psn is tennesseehawk320
---
Maybe. There’s nothing to really suggest either way. All we know is we want those items discarded and we should be more suspicious of these unsubstantiated posts. Tbh I skeptical of half the stories I read on this subreddit and they read like they’re karma farming. 
---
So for 60$ they should entertain you for life? Haha some of you are some entitled ass people. Shouldn’t you be complaining to your grocery store for not selling that piece of wonka candy from the movie that lasts forever? 
---
Yesss, more baseball jacket variants to collect =D!! Ah I must have missed the engineer outfit, I’ve finished the BoS mission. Gonna go check my stash then, thanks! 
---
It should be your biggest gripe with the game and not with the critics that it can't decide what it should be. It doesn't really work that great as single player game, because of the limits of interaction with the world. And it doesn't really work great as mmo because of the lack of tools and mechanics. 
---
In Fallout 4 I kept playing because of the npcs and the the settlements. Building up all those locations, seeing settlers move in, traders come and go made me start the game again and again. I don't have that in 76. And I don'T have to mmo content either to keep going.
---
Neither of this is the critics fault.
---
I’m still running from scorch beasts! 😂😂

I popped in on the last part of the end game fight as a lower level.  I had no business being there but got the achievement for killing the queen. It was pretty satisfying but I know I need to experience the entires path it takes to get there before I start something like this.  Very cool though and if the bugs get worked out I can see more and more of this taking place. 
---
That's not what I was talking about. You can walk into a scene without skeletons or teddy bears and determine the cause regardless of reading anything, and the land is filled with little things that encourage you to go off the beaten path.
---
An open world game that I can think of that features no environmental storytelling is Black Desert Online.
---
Certain missions have to be completed in one go, and progress won't save if you're only part of the way through.
---
Did the math . If you lived to be 80 , you will have spent .4ish% of your live playing borderlands2 . Simply amazing 
---
So *that's* where all the Jet went.
---
I use a ghoul slayers explosive gatling gun. Takes SB down fast enough, I found it last week, my first explosive weapon drop since the beta 
---
It isn't like FO4.

Wouldnt it be nice if the mod showed up as junk in the collector

Don't have that problem. Sure you don't have dysentery?

It's hard to feel bad for anyone who bought this knowing Bethesda has been sketchy lately AND seeing a lack of details in the purchase of this bottle. If you buy something on the internet (commercials and ads are good examples) the product will not include everything shown exactly how it is. I don't know what anyone who bought this was thinking..."Hmm, all these different Nuka Dark Rum products..oh different types of containers for this drink with no specific details on the material used for the bottle?  Oh well, I choose to bet nearly 100 dollars on the assumption it's gonna be a nice glass bottle.....oh that huge nylon bag controversy? Totally irrelevant!...wait this isn't what I thought it was!!! I'm gonna take it out on everyone involved with the product instead of getting a refund like these other people being rational/calm as well. How SHOCKING on Bethesda's part, this is so out of character for them!" Regardless, even though it's hard to feel bad for these people I believe everyone does to an extent cause frankly Bethesda has been wretched lately. Although they have released a lot of merch that'd make a fans dedicated Fallout or in general gaming display (like shelves) look quite amazing. Overpriced? Yes. Bad business practices at times? Yes. So do we have to be careful with what we choose to buy? YES. Look around and look carefully...you'll find something worth the cash. Be patient. The reality is that we live surrounded by Capitalism where everyone wants your money so they'll swim through as many loopholes as they can to get it. Sorry for the long rambling, the whole situation has been on my mind since I have been a huge fan since Morrowind on the original Xbox and Fallout 3 on the 360 so I felt compelled to say something after all this controversy. It breaks my heart to see them do this to their fans but at the same time the fans aren't always in the right either. I miss seeing forums/videos full of love for Bethesda or a certain game but it's become such a mess. Let's all hope they can produce new games that are WORTH our money. I want a Fallout 5 that truly makes me wanna throw my cash at with no regrets.

it's actually 2102, whis is reflected in the new photo frame!
---
I will be a grinch and say the atomic store is still stunningly overpriced. I thought the creation club was way overpriced, and that's downright cheap in comparison. If prices were about 1/10 of what they are -- if we got 5000 atoms for $5, I'd probably spend $5-$10 a month. As it is, there's just no way.
---
oh thx, im newbe at reddit so i didnt know that exist.
---
happy new year to u :)
---
what do you do after you get the jetpack? is it required to access new missions/quests/content? 
---
Im late, but it’s a little bit south of the middle of the map.
---
That's right!
---
Probably once they can get the servers more stable
---
While scraping legs I’ve unlocked Asbestos lining, a Chest only piece. 
---
Until then I use to build all the body parts, since then, only Arms as they are the cheapest to build. 
---
There are a ton of f2p games that have kept me engaged longer than this game has.
---
Just remember we all lived together in that vault and had a long social life together of 20 years before leaving the vault.
---
Unless you know he was abit of dick to ya in the vault...
---
No problem my man the community is always here to help.
---
I’ve done plenty of that too... from RPing as responders, traveling salesman, BoS, vault tec member to insane asylum escapee. It’s just... Idk, they need to give us more tools to make the player interaction truly meaningful. Right now it just feels hollow... functional guilds/factions and more ways to interact with the game world would be a good start.
---
As it stands right now I’m taking a break and getting my Fallout fix with 4 and a boat load of mods
---
Yes enclave vendor has them.
---
Buy 2 
---
Even though it says "shocks" being 2 its only 1 !!
---
Hi [u/jessBethesda](https://www.reddit.com/user/jessBethesda)  
---
Thank you for replying, I'm on PS4 and it's still an issue, [https://i.imgur.com/3Rvtb01.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/3Rvtb01.jpg)
---
This they did say they would but the current servers need some loving first. :)
---
I think when you see checkpointed come on screen during a quest your good at that point.
---
Yeah I still carry a lvl 10 explosive black powder pistol that does like 650 damage. 
---
Do you have any examples? 
---
No idea, newly built however we've already got over 100
---
I actually did the same thing and scrapped 4 different mods for excavator power armor after server hopping for awhile to acquire them. I noticed all of them ended up scrapped and I didn’t have them in my stash or inventory. 
---
However, when I put my armor on the crafting station, for some reason it allowed me to actually go through with crafting the mod onto my armor, without even having the necessary flux or the mod and they were definitely not highlighted to indicate that I had them in my possession. It was very strange. I have not tried it again since then, but maybe others have experienced this? 
---
Especially if you build next to the one full of glowing anglers. What could go wrong?
---
it's just a jetpack. 
---
The most efficient way isn't always the most fun
---
If only this power was distributed to the other games I play. Meanwhile, in Elder Scrolls Online...
---
If you are insane, maybe you are the Overseer, just forgot.
---
I like double shot and limb dmg cryolator go for the knees!
---
All of this sounds amazing for us traders lol.
---
Depends on your build. If you have the right defensive perk cards, I'd say Bloodied.
---
You could also look at Instigating or plain Two Shot (without explosive).
---
anti armor should be 1st place imo. Adds 50% and you only can get 36% with perks
---
Yeah, I got a scribe outfit, engineer and maybe one other one. It was all during the finding and retaking of Fort Defiance. 
---
It does say will use x-01 mod for 2 steel on the right side where it shows materials for repair. Though we're all used to just clicking it instantly rather than reading to make sure it won't take a mod. 
---
Sorry for your loss. 
---
I haven't seen any weapon with a star, because none have them
---
they are diamonds
---
Or just join a group and then rejoin it when disconnecting
---
I was planning on doing something similar to what you mentioned. I'm just hoping we get stash limit increases and it's also a pain trying to move things between alts so I'm hoping we get a unified stash/bank for crafting materials sort of like what eso has.
---
&gt; Can you tame stuff like the opossums, radchickens, foxes, etc? 
---
I would love to know this as well. I just want a pet, not a guardian :P
---
Not sure why I have not upvoted this yet.
---
I have been having issues where enemies in locations I am in just outright die without me shooting them or any other player or enemy hitting them. This has happened several times and even eaten up a few boss drops and legendaries.
---
From my own in game testing, I can say that the issue may be linked to the white spring resort cranking out the massive horde of robots as this was the case every time I travelled there after experiencing this issue. As such other players in opposite ends of the map have their entire instance die on them and taking their drops due to needing to shoot an enemy to gain its loot.
---
PS. When I got bored around level 150ish [I got bored too and did the power armor collecting thing](https://imgur.com/a/DB2zZps). Ended up with 16 sets at the end of the day, all types and ranging from levels 15 to 50. 
---
Then I dressed up as a travelling salesman and sold them to players in exchange for Dog Food ( since i didnt need caps), or put on a mechanics outfit and gave them out for free.
---
Trust me, I've set a lot of personal goals and tried to find my own fun as much as I can.
---
Bethesda just needs to provide more
---
System?
---
You need a tissue?
---
Also a working fridge. I've seen a lot of posts for people asking for a way to preserve food for longer so they can have food shops and the like
---
If they increase it to 800 you’ll just hoard more crap and complain wanting it to be raised again. Just don’t have stuff you don’t need 
---
Between those 2, Furious is better if you have the perks to go with it, but without any of the perks, Armor Piercing is better.
---
I wouldn't mind it to be like add a second bot to all the train station that let's people buy and sell from other players. The caps and items can be delivered to you by a Mr Handy
---
My friend left his power armor, and this is how his body glitched out.  Helmet stayed on, marine left and combat armor arms went all DRRR
---
I think they should rip off of RuneScape and just have a grand exchange, either way though; both of our suggestions are incredibly big requests 
---
Ughhhhhhh.... The DMV quest definitely resets if you crash or the server hiccups. Took 5 times to get through it.
---

---
You say rushing because it's not your pace, but it might not be rushing for a player like me with 200 hours. I'm single, my kid is a teenager and lives mostly with her mom, even when she stay with me she does teenager things like meet her friends. So I have a lot of time. I was not rushing it from my perspective. I just logged in.
---
But the point is: Wether you get there in 2 months or 6 months doesn't make a difference, when there's nothing at the end. Just pray that you might get lucky and they have added stuff when you get there. 
---
It's not only content that is missing, it is the proper game mechanics for high level also. So just throwing in some more armor pieces is not enough.
---
Seems like it. Wont let me go into the silos now.
---
How can you server hop for days and not immediatly put in on the seconf you buy it right there in the bunker. There is a power station right next to the vendor. I'm very surprised if you didn't knew about thestored mods scrap bug since it is present since day 1. They act exactly like bulked junk, when you crafg something and don'g havd materials it will take them from a mod. I just received my Jet Pack yesterday after about 8 full hours of server hopping. It is amazing. It does however deplede my AP way faster then i imagined so now i might need to buy some Kinetic Servos to go with my Jet Pack.
---
36% for rifles, stabilized gives +45% for heavy gunners (whopping 95% armor ignore with a leg perk)
---
X box
---
Nope
---
&gt;  I'm afraid of high leveled players because everytime is like a lottery: they could be nice and kind or could slaughter you and burn your body just for joke. These last type of people are the worst and they haven't understand we aren't on Fortnite.
---
You realize that you're playing a *post-apocalyptic* multiplayer *role-playing* game, right?  
---
Real players are filling in the void that exists in FO
---
76 from having zero NPC factions running around.
---
You can sell it to all the vendor bots. I think it’s 1 cap per piece. 
---
Ganking is reduced with the Bounty system. Option for level-based Worlds would suit players wanting to fight fair and square.
---
How would you know what it's like if you haven't played it in 2 weeks
---
I always end up with 1.5-2.5k steel, so I usually bulk it up so I can sell it if I need to clear some room. With this new bit of information, I guess I'll have some unbulking to do when I get on.
---
I can I destroyed a players xo1 legs with 1 hit and he might have electrically grounded mutation like I do which reduces energy damage 
---
The issue with the current size it you have to dedicated  a lot of perks to storage and it sucks, especially for non strength builds.
---
You forgot the final instruction where you shove it up your butt
---
U can bulk it and then sell it also. Bulking junk saves space also, if u didnt know that
---
It would have been nice/very helpful to have had more clarification on this last night to inform the player base if the silos going offline was part of this.  
---
Rip OPs stove.
---
I have 8 strength. I have 0 weight issues and I’m level 120
---
Just be super careful until this is patched the pain of losing good mods can cut deep lol.
---
Don't feed the tard
---
melee perk gives 75%, but even with 50% pen from the weapon effect and the 75% from the perk you will have like 93% armor pen. I read a post a few weeks ago where someome did some research about this.
---
So 45%+50% wont be 90%, the post was only about melee weapons but I think ita the same for riflea heavy guns etc
---
Cause i do research ? Just cause i dont play doesnt mean i dont keep up with games. The game hasnt changed last i played 
---
vented leg mods don't work either. 
---
I feel it’s necessary hahaha
---
Yeah same tbh. I've done everything except launching a nuke onto the SBQ. I'm waiting for the expansions. 
---
Lol hey arma ive seen u b4 in r/fo76
---
it's not my fault I want to keep in game items, when it comes to twelve caps or a trophy I'd rather just have the trophy 
---
My heart goes out to you. My explosive double barrel was like the 4th legendary I had ever found, and about 100 legendaries later I still haven't found a better one to replace it.   Its a lebel 25, and it still does more dps than any other gun Ive had.
---
Yea, you’re an idiot. In a survival situation you don’t need the trophy. 
---
How would I treat disgust with a tissue?
---
Same thing is happening to us!  we thought maybe someone already launched the nukes on the server so it wouldn't give us the option, but then remembered we started collecting the keys while there was an active nuke zone earlier this week, so that's not it :(
---
we really want to do the event properly without cheating at least once....
---
Fo76bazaar is the place to go. Mutation serums run for 200-500 caps a piece on xbox.
---
You're making a Bloodied unarmed build? I considered it, but low  HP in no armor in a nuke zone would just be instadeath. How do you plan to avoid that?
---
It was actually 
---
The [nuke codes reset each Monday](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/43880/kw/nuke%20codes), beyond this info, if you're having an issue with launching nukes, please contact me with Gamertag and platform (if on console) or Bethesda.net username (if on PC). 
---
Any in-game events will be messaged in detail and in advance of the day they're occurring. The Whitespring tweet was a social initiative and not directly related to game activity in any way other than encouraging players to meet up to take cool pics specifically with photomode. 
---
And thank you! Happy New Year to you too!
---
Thanks! Right when I said “that’s it I’m done” I got the plans! I guess next time I need to give up sooner 😬
---
Wow 
---
No, but I get a good laugh out of that one Protectron near that camp to the west of Morgantown Airport.
---
That’s nice to know
---
Most people on this game are saints ime. People make a lot of noise about bad players but it's a tiny minority.

---
I still have a few things left, getting back on now. 
---
You don't need to bulk silver scrap to sell it, and only bulking certain junk types, like lead, saves any noticeable space. 
---
Thank you! I'll send this along. 
---
While i have said my bit and piece on dupers (venting) and the community definitely feels the same.
---
They have been on holidays buddy and most likely today is their first day back. Hopefully we have a patch comming soon that has serious fixes to the duper issues.
---
geez, this kids got the ptsd from playing too much fallout, calm down it's a game 
---
The one that has gotten me 100 times is Uranium Fever. Repairing the extractors has eaten numerous very valuable mods from my stash.
---
It's a stupid bug.
---
I also encountered this issue. Even reinstalling my game did not fix it.
---
They said they had plans to.  One thing I did when I constantly found myself getting close to 600lbs was to take out everything in each category and make a note of the weight in each one.  That let me know (in case you don't already) which category was the issue.  Some things you don't realize how much they weigh especially considering that our perks affecting weights of various things doesn't affect what's in our stash.  I can keep myself around 500-520lb by only keeping the ammo I REALLY use which means no more keeping missiles or nukes (even just a couple or so of each), no more fuel, no more cryo ammo etc etc.  Of course if you're melee then you probably don't have a problem with ammo.  For junk I only keep max \~ 125 to 150 of any given thing.  Some things like bone I only keep 75-100 of.   
---
 The only exception being screws and springs although I'm over 200 quantity springs now.  I only keep a few grenades when earlier I would keep scores of them.  I stop picking up dog food cans when I get to 35 or so.  Same with purified water.
---
I do want the stash limit to go to 800 or 1000 though because I'd like to keep some weapons I'm finding, but have to keep scrapping them because I just don't have the room.  Unless they nerf melee I'll probably switch to it at some point just to see how the other half lives so I've saved a few nice melee weapons, but considering some of the rifles I save I don't have a lot of room for them!
---
The dirty paper backgrounds dont help...
---
Geez, this guy’s crying about a nonexistent issue that he causes to himself. 
---
nah its all good
---
Everytime I seem to mention this bug, it's ignored or downvoted.
---
I hope your post gets attention, I already gave up on grognak's ae because of the bug.
---
Op has 5000 rads, irradiation mutation, dystentary and the clap, drinks dirty water then comes to r/fo76 to wonder why hes so thirsty. 😂😂😂
---
Dear God..... 
---
Why are you insulting me ? Was i rude to you or anyone? Or youre that hurt by my post towards a game thats actually shit? Game hasnt changed for the better at all but obviously you dont care . youre simple minded and accept garbage.. Its been 2 months and they have done little effort for the game, theyre charging more in th atom shop etc. Literally laughing at our faces but imma tard tho ?  Fking flamer 
---
My!  Aren't you the offended one!?!  Get over it, Mary.
---
I know I know.. I went to bed thinking the same thing, it was right behind me!
---
I usually have loads of steel but I had made a ton of ammo not long before.
---
What is the reason for such an argument? How is raising the stash limit to 800 negativly affect your gameplay that you need to hinder other people's fun with useless storage management. The junk and everything that is stackable doesn't affect server performance only duped weapons and other non-stackable items do. Just because you stoped collecting junk doesn't mean other like a playstile where you don't pick anything that isn't a legendary two shot explosive up.
---
I'm not even crying about anything, I'm not op lmfao. you know what assuming does, makes an ass out of you and me (but mostly you) 
---
My thoughts: Fallout 76 is the first experiment of bgs with an online game (not counting elder scrolls online from zeni max online studios). Therefore i see the players as some kind of lab - rats atm. Bgs is aware of the bugs and issues, trying to polish them out (at a debatable speed, but nonetheless they do). They don't expect fo76 to be (or even ever become) flawless, but are learning from fo76 how to establish an mmo with fallout / elder scrolls mechanics using the dated creation engine.
---
My guess is that they are rather willing to pay for the servers by themselfes to get the needed experience and routine to eventually drop a nice working elder scrolls 6 later that may get monetarized by fee / transactions.  
---
Bgs sees the elder scrolls as their main / more important product, so they took the massive risk with their fallout franchise. With the outcome we have seen at launch and since then. Fo76 really, really hurt the fallout franchise for years, something they wanted to aboid happening to the elder scrolls series.
---
Hahaha
---
people keep pushing the economy meme.
---
Fo76 isn't a mmo.
---
Glass half full and all that!
---
Or I could continue to have my friend transfer to my alts and continue to use my 3000 lbs.
---
I was more or less asking for a way to make this less of a hassle. Because this is what people with tons and tons of good gear (like me) do. I'm not going to throw away my 10+ TSE guns and 20+ Sentinel armors.
---
P.S. I'm a pistol build, weight is a problem with only 4 STR and Through-Hiker eating up my dps perks (agility has perk bloat for pistols).
---
This happened with me and the three scorchbeasts I took down at fort defiance in the event. Not impressed.
---
You're saying "What if Earth is just another realm" ???
---
There's already a theory that Earth and Tamriel are the same place. That Fallout happens in the distant past (continents continue drifting and smash back into each other creating Tamriel super continent. Elder Scrolls is the 'present' and the new series Bethesda is creating will be the distant future. Theory based on the plant species found in the Predwyn in F04 alluding to the Nirnroot plant in Elder Scrolls.
---
Perhaps both theories combined together...
---
There’s no reason for it, can’t expect to be catered to when the only issue is that the player doesn’t know what they’re doing. 
---
I do the same in Charleston and get sad when it doesn't ring 
---
Sweet thanks for the info Jess. I should let you know i had a really messed up few days and vented here on reddit. Alot of the community felt the same and i was just venting but it might be worth a look. Just know i love the game and the community and was just in a bad mood when writing that.
---
But it got alot of support from the community. I don't want you lads thinking i am a bad egg just very upset about exploits ruining things as a store owner in 76.
---
Careful bro, the shills are downvoting you 
---
Ooo Thanks buddy and who ever made this big thanks.
---
I agree. I feel like the dev's have been really slow. And this is the first time ive ever felt ripped off by a Bethesda game. The game has so much potential but they just fuck around.
---
You’re complaining that you can’t keep your “trophies”? So yea, crying
---
Union Hat plan found on a body in the NE section of 59 and 86B
---
Your tone was extremely patronizing. Id say at least 30 people agree with me, given your points. not trying to be rude, but you need to look at what you said.
---
Someone needs to draw this as the ‘I’m gonna show my best friend Squidward to everybody in town, wearing a salmon suit’ gag
---
Sorry, can't help you. I'm on PC.
---
Cant get into the silos either
---
Look for train stations inside there should be a robot that you can trade with
---
yeah, I like the game but there are way too many defenders for it 
---
Was he aiming at you a pipe pistol and asking for its ammo? Whoa.
---
Don't know how you guys put up with this shit
---
So? It can't have a decent economy?
---
What hurts is a week after the game came out and it was already on sale. The only benefit i got for paying full price was the Closed Beta, and its not like that headstart even matters in a game where there is barely any endgame, and the endgame that does exist is easily reachable.
---
Free adhesive farm
---
I like the game
---
I came across a megasloth here my first time going through. So quite similar to the behemoth. 
---
Sucks for you loss. Also you might already know this but applying mods to power armor and other stuff is free and doesn't cost you materials. It asks for a list of materials to apply it but it doesn't require them at all.
---
Yeah bro its a must for all PA users i carry 50+ at all times.
---
Been saying most of this since the “BETA”. Hopefully the new year lights a fire under Bethesda’s ass to make QoL improvements 
---
Feels like it wouldn't matter, the raw number isn't the problem, it's the lack of good tools to visualize what is in your stash. Like you probably don't have 590 pounds of items you actually want, but the game makes it so hard to see what is taking space that it's impossible to organize it much lower. 
---
let's put it this way: do you think Dark Souls should have a "healthy market"? or that one multiplayer mod for San Andreas?
---
because that essentially sums ups Fo76.
---
I didn't even get the BETA since I was traveling for most of it's duration.
---
we can't launch nukes on PC either.  No option to do get the location for the code pieces, and the elavators down to the silos don't do anything.
---
r/fallout76settlements too
---
I can put in a kitchen stove for you (on ps4) 375 caps for the stove. 165 caps for the service call, 120 caps labor. 75 caps to connect the gas line 50 caps for electric.
---
Bullets are more expensive than starch tho ;)
---
It's not like an end game would matter anyway.  Unless they add some SBQ level boss that is nearly, if not completely immune to Explosive and Ballistic damage and only takes about 25% from Radiation and Energy weapons, people will tear through it the same way they do everything else.   And if they did add an end game boss that forced people to rebuild their characters just to fight/beat it, people would complain about being unable to kill it with the OP weapons that made the game a bore to them.
---
Of course it would cost over 2x to simply cast a glass mold. That's why we paid $80 for the cheap rum but iconic bottle.
---
"it's not my fault I want to keep in game items" how is this complaining or crying? you need to learn to read before being a rude loon on Reddit lol. I keep the things I want and have no storage issues, but op does the same and has storage issues. just letting you know, since you couldn't understand the first time 
---
Its like the unwritten laws of gaming:
---
1. Your newly released game shouldn't go on sale literally a week after release.
---
2. Your game that you released over a year ago shouldn't be the same price as it was on launch.
---
I wish these dev's and publishers would wake the fuck up.
---
No diseases at all
---
r/fo76bazaar buddy its like a player market.
---
Mutations can also be bought from the Enclave vendor for around 4k caps, but better to try one of the trade discords
---
nukacrypt.com
---
That's cool and all but those clocks are being crafted by us.  
---
I'd like the feature.
---
I mean its not hard to see that bethseda doesnt care especially THEY know fallout is loved by everyone.. But i mean imma asshole for saying something that everyone knows but theyre all in denial.
---
Melee the shit out of those ugly mtfs :D
---
I'm on PC will be on in 6 hours can build you a free one if ya want.
---
But they set you on fire!
---
Was the event live?  IDK what to tell ya man, I've only seen the event pop up once in almost 200 hrs of playtime
---
Is this under the strength tree? 
---
Stars go up to 5?
---
DEY TURK OUR STERVES
---
Nope, you get banned for cheating and using cheatengine but not for using mods. 
---
I was definitely a bit miffed at the sale, too. I don’t regret paying full price, but it was pretty obnoxious of Bethesda 
---
Reserved for loot boxes.
---
Someone is within like 3-500 feet of yours, I like to go over and try to see if their base is worth my inconvenience
---
which you can farm :)
---
Step 1: go to irradiated water
---
Step 2: drink said water until you get mutated
---
Grab the bright mod and make sure to cover your eyes lol.
---
Sorry to hear that and yea that’s also one of the reason I went out and get myself another 2-handed melee weapon 
---
Having the same issue on PC. Have switched servers, but can't get access to silos and the boards in the command center show 'in progress' and 'complete' at the same time. Additionally I can't initiate a search for silo codes from the command terminals.
---
you take games waaaay too seriously my dude, you need to get out a little more lol you play them for fun, there is no right or wrong way to play any game. just have fun. 
---
I haven’t bought shit and will not buy shit from the Atom store.
---
Tone is the problem or rather lack of tone. Any tone is in your head as I was trying to be clear. 
---
And downvotes are a bad, bad metric in a sub that now has a post-christmas swarm of ten to fourteen year olds. 
---
There was a dead scorched megasloth there, must have run afoul of the mutants. 
---
Actually the most convenient time for this exact kind of bug to happen.
---
Its worst than the bag situation. In the bag situation people purchased the power armor edition mostly for the helmet. In this situation people wanted this product for the bottle, not the cheap rum which is what they decided to screw us on. 
---
Instigating is amazing with sniper builds
---
You’d think it’s for the super, but it’s just for a regular sledge hammer. 
---
Standard sledge
---
Nah, me too. The crashes and dc's are infuriating. But OP is not some kind of lonesome rider here. There are thousands making their voice heard here. much more on other forums (reddit is not tthat special either) and hundreds of thousands playing all the time.
---
Just because he is playing the game doesn't entitle OP to more than us other players.
---
And he has this one post in his history, and he hasn't commented anything since BETA. So where and when is he sticking up for the game exactly? Because he's logging in from time to time?
---
So are you and I.
---
They have fixed several dupes and people keep looking for new ones each time; the playerbase doing it are a cancer on this community.
---
What magnifier feature?
---
Yes you could with the radio. You are correct, that's why it was a dumb idea. 
---
You're an idiot, I'm being fully confrontational. 
---
Yeah just be advised that nukes have been glitching the past day and people are unable to launch. Some say they turned it off for the New Year's Eve event in whitesprings... but the thesda has not confirm this

I feel like I drink a ton of water without speed demon

I think how much light a virtual flashlight gives off, is the least of Fallout 76's issues.

I am back online. I still have plenty of ammo, and I'm even throwing it some free plans and recipes! (I've been plan farming)
---
In case you would see something "strange" in the future like I have seen: the 4th star happens when you add the modifier "Skorcher Killer Receiver" to a 3 star Legendary
---
Is it scrap or ore? You have to smelt it if it’s ore before you can sell it (same for all ores).  
---
Items that you can’t bulk but will sell for 1 cap per unit-  
---
Gold  
---
Silver  
---
Fiber optic  
---
Antiseptic  
---
Circuits  
---
Crystals  
---
I think there is one more but I can’t recall. You generally don’t need large quantities of these items and can free up considerable stash space by selling them to vendors (I keep around 50 of each or so).
---
That is a false acusation since even my stash is close to 600 lbs with just 100 of each material and about 300 of important materials like screws, gear, adhesive, etc. Gunpowder, steel and lead also occupies a large part of stash since you don't always have all 3 in equal numbers to immediatly craft bullets with them. You want peopld to throw those resources away and then not have them when needed.
---
And he isn't sticking up for anything, look at his post history. He has this post and commented on another post during BETA.
---
I don't know, I think it is bugged for them.
---
but you overlooked the things that they did fix in favor of "WAAAAAH DUPING DUPING" the disconnects and t poses are almost non existent now (at least in my experience) 
---
Right that's why there are thousands apon thousands playing

I know there's a button that has you walk instead of run. If you press caps on the PC this is what happens and I don't think you can Sprint when you're doing it and it really sucks. Try to look for the button that toggles walk. Let me know if that helps.
---
Not OP but I’m paranoid about other players yanking my power armor when it’s on a power armor rack. I don’t repair or mod unless I’m at my camp with the door locked. 
---
Well to be fair, we are in the heart of denial on /fo76. Any kind of criticism has to be said like you're walking on eggshells. 5 paragraphs about how great the game is, and then follow it with 1 sentence max about what you're unhappy with.
---
You can reach 4 stars with a 3 star drop machete, and adding the legendary mod: Sacrificial blade.
---
They are aloud to take as long as they want for there Holliday 
---
It isn’t rude to ask, they’ve given us a mess &amp; went awol to spend the holidays with their families which I understand... but people have paid millions in total for an incomplete title that doesn’t have good balancing or support. I have a lot of fun playing this game but some things just really start to take a toll on me while playing. Stash limit needs to go everyone’s said it, camp budget needs to go it’s worthless just limit the size of our camp height &amp; width limit so it’s easier on the server people aren’t building towers &amp; shit but seriously. How can we be expected to go 200+ levels without going over 600 lb in our stash.. huge oversight by Bethesda don’t understand how any of them thought that made sense in a game where you’re constantly picking things up either to scrap or use. 
---
This. They said to expect private servers and mods later so we'll see
---
Ok and ? The game is still shit tho. For a AAA title. Do you even know what a AAA title game is ?

Bugs  
---
Weightless Marine Armor is broken with the chameleon mutation it does not enable.
---
Marine Armor there is no upgrade on the chest past Welded even scrapping them you do not learn anything new.
---
No Legendary Scout Armor Pieces minus the Bastion not sure if that was intentional.
---
All Armor's Stabilizing arms mods cannot be installed.
---
Servers need better hardware to handle loads the crashing is getting to be a bit much when too many nukes drop.
---
Silos have a cool down timer of 999 hours right now with the holotape.
---
Items disappearing out of stash and inventories randomly still. From Ammo/Aid/Armor/Weapons/Junk/Mods/Power Armor.  
---
Armor/weapon/power Armor mods go poof out of stash/character if you craft if you have the mats to craft or not. It automatically uses up mods. Make the mods none auto crafting material items.
---
Bags falling though the world or that got a blast aoe push back moving around the map I had to chase my bag for 20 minutes last night Died, had to run around glass cavern, then outside, then back into glassed cavern.
---
You guy still need your own customer service stop using ESO's and you need in game support options that are real and work. This is a bug lack of customer service and support is a big issue.
---
PVP you just need to allow it or give a full option to turn it off. its kind of broken even sometimes turning off passive and not being able to kill someone. Or people not in passive able to kill passive players. Honestly it needs to go to the strongest survive. But keep everyone 50 and under giving them an option so they can level in peace or you just let us go at it in an all out slug fest. Those with bounties if we shoot their camp we get a bounty  as they use their camp to hide or having it with mass defenses to aid them in a bounty hunter or pissed off player. But passive does need to work or not have it at all. Is about the only option if you cannot fix it.  
---
Power armor randomly bugging out and unequipping pieces constantly when it starts it can last hours or days.  
---
It still rains under cover in Power Armor.  
---
Regular screen shots to show bugs in support tickets give a black screen at least in power armor with just the hud showing. That's why I do not even bother showing a screen shot because I cannot take one, and running in bordered to boarderless  window mode the game runs like pure poo.  
---
Tell ESO support if there is a visual bug like stuff being locked or a bad camera angle locked, it is not the drivers stop having us do stuff burning up 12-24hrs of our time with back and forth stuff. To even items going poof. You are not doing yourselves any favors and just making us as customers mad.  
---
Suggestions  
---
Unnerf the chameleon mutation... or if you do not do that at least make the stealth boys weigh less.  Kind of hard to creep up on a bounty...  When they can see you a mile away.  
---
Increase Stash by 100-200 more  
---
Make an account stash of 300-400 weight so we can transfer stuff between characters easily, also let us transfer caps  
---
Please make more content, this atomic store stuff already lined up is out of control, where are our quest and content? You have time to make stuff to sell to us or have us grind for that is cosmetic but no time for lots of content? We already know this stuff was planned months in advance as the files got uploaded to our machines and someone poked in the files and showed all the stuff you will be selling us in the store. It is getting to the point people are being evil to just find something to do.  Once the grinding is done, characters are fully to close to being decked out, you killed the scorch queen a bunch of times, did all the dailies and events. Not much else to do.   
---
I see all the duping post and the economy I am going to tell you now, the ones that are crying are probably selling legendarys for real cash or demanding an almost maxed cap amount.  You offer no in game support to get our stuff back that the server sends into oblivion, refuse to give support for that. So people are helping themselves or finding people to help them. We have no auction halls. there is really no economy in the game and having wealth capped to carrying capped or turning peoples alts into stash monkey slow moving sloths so they don't drop/toss away good stuff. Is not really the answer.   
---
Hurting the lower level players on xp is also not the solution.  If you cannot offer content, in game support let them play the game how they want to play it.  They want to dupe, use exploits let them. Until you have the rest of the ship under control and you do not. Those are none issues.  
---
.308 put the drop rate back to normal it drops so little now most players will not bother with it.  
---
Stop listening to every crusader on here complaining about stuff that does not matter or is worried for greed reasons about the exploits. Start listening to us on actual game bugs that really truly ruin the experience. Stuff that really messes with our experience. Like losing our hard earned stuff I am still not happy about losing my 3 star legendary .50 cal I worked hard to get and your ESO support told me to pound sand. This is getting to the point its stupid, oh stopping duping but my items still go into the nether.  Fix the game the stuff that ruins players experience like losing their stuff and offering no help, while you add to the atomic store, made it a little harder on dupers that solves a lot... If it was not for dupers some players may had quit already as they lost their stuff and you refused to help. The dupers many of them are nice people and if you are a decent human being to them they will just give you things and help you. You know doing your job for you like us modders have done your jobs for you since morrowind. It is just frustrating I see you doing stuff to dupers while those who legitimately play the game get the shaft without in game support, their hard earned stuff going mia forever. Priorities, the customers not on a crusade to stop something pointless that play the game fully legitimately that should be your focus.   
---
tl;dr: Fallout 76 is an RPG where you play [Sisyphus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus)
---
Power Armor is not public unless you drop it with the "R" button. When you place it down normally only you can interract with it.
---
I agree, a feature they have already said they will add eventually is definitely a great idea!
---
Below are screenshots of my perk cards asscociated and and effects. None of which would suggest your assumption.

If you still have a supply drop holotape in your inventory you can drop it on the ground and then pick it up. The quest will reappear, though this only work for me once.
---
You can use them anytime you want if you have one in your inventory. You do not need the quest.
---
Just find your local relay Tower and insert it into the computer.
---
Not so much. I just go on some small runs for disease cure (forest) materials every few days, for about a dozen of each necessary plant. Using green thumb speeds that part up, then using Chemist and Super Duper gives me about 15 disease cures on a regular basis, so I can give some away and keep a healthy supply for myself.
---
I did, and now with sped demon I drink much, much more
---
adding. Thanks.
---
I have seen community managers commenting on threads today, so there's that.
---
My atoms for a Anti Materiel Rifle.
---
Do you know the modifier on stand fast? I've been trying 5x weightless and I get put into danger frequently, but it could be because i'm using a TSE silenced weapon which is still kinda noisy due to 2 explosions.
---
I'm on PS4, but good idea op. glad to see not every post is in regards to past patches or upcoming ones 
---
Six, currently. 
---
I regret paying full price because $29.99 is way closer to what its actual price should have been
---
I fixed my problem I had to exit my Power Armor 
---
Square?  I’ll have to try that.  I didn’t think it worked for loot bags. 
---
You gotta repair it to 200%. Omcenit hits 100 percent its just k agsin. But it takes a while to hit that.

---
Please let the devs know that mods should be protected from automatic scrapping.  Please make this a priority, it is affecting most users and everyone I know (including me) has scrapped a mod accidentally which they intended to use.
---
Why are you posting pictures of your perc cards and not your status
---
nope, 
---
did a selfie.... nothing
---
Seen replies right now from Beth here so they should be back today atleast. Mind you we have to year around even xmas day is not off the table. So maybe someone who does can give an idea how long it normally lasts.
---
I'll add that they are all cosmetic plans, no armor or weapons plans, sorry.
---
Thanks any idea why the hell I just got negative karma for that post. Jeez guys im just tryin to help
---
Same issue here, board is messed up and it only gives me the option to collect a key card. 
---
If it just grouped pacifists on their own servers, the problem would be solved. 
---
That's not the same thing. Managers can do stuff from home on their computer. Most programmers don't take their programs home, or choose not to. 
---
No clue 
---
I do have the 200% perk, I use it on my lever all the time but on that gun it doesn't increase damage 
---
We were told that the next big update is coming on the 15th, so I'd say that we will most likely have at least "smaller" interaction and maybe hotfixes by the 8th
---
I wasn't referring to changing game engines, just the software being used.
---
why are nukes disabled? 
---
https://nukacrypt.com/solved
---
Damn. I actually bought that one too, from the vendor in Watoga. Then, literally ten minutes later, I found the exact same mod in a crate when I was looting a Supermutant camp.
---
I've begun a new habit. When I take a workshop, I only lock the resources I'm currently trying to gather. Also, I spend some time to build crafting benches, a water purifier, and a stash box. I don't know if anyone ever finds it helpful, but it's fun.
---
Normal guns dont get thebl buff. Which makes me think handheld tick weapons are bugged. 
---
Yes, complete and utter abuse of the early release tag. A blatant reskin cash grab with a trailer attached that is flat out misleading.
---
Like i said, I'm surprised but also reminded that some companies are popular to hate while others get away with murder.
---
aha
---
Sorry I can't remember where but I've come across a couple in "Camp Allowed" zones. Maybe it's a new misc quest for you!
---
this man knows how to work the system 
---
Did you read the question? The OP asked specifically about "PR Managers" in this subreddit...
---
Happy New Year! Reading is guud!
---
Wait till you see the two shot explosive dragons damage. 
---
They hosted a photo event at whitesprings for new years eve and didn't wanted people to nuke that place. They forgot to add the nukes back after the event.
---
Lol imagine playing H1Z1 and having that set of programmers. They only worked M-F and never weekends and new patches came out Friday so all the bugs lasted the weekend lmaooo
---
I'll be on in about 15 minutes. 
---
Log out and log back in yup.
---
one last question, where do you get the mod for the drill? (and what's the highest lvl drill you can get?) 
---
You should write novels.
---
The perk cards, I thought, were meant to negate the need to eat and drink. Either way, here is my status.
---
I would prefer to have a way to smelt ore without using acid.
---
Maybe today they're going back, seems a bit early to be honest, but I won't stop them from getting back to work early.
---
I was expecting them to be back on the 5th or something after the queen died.
---
The explosive effect should be changed.
---
It should not add more explosive damage, instead it should spread existing gun damage out to be AoE.
---
Adding more damage to a weapon that can be affected by Ex-Expert is just crazy OP.
---
Intelligence
---
Its low level, and I scrapped a few to get the mod. I remember there being a spawn with the excavator armor place. In the room with the building stands. 
---
Intelligence, actually.
---
Known since Beta to everyone and his neighbour  
---
thanks man! 
---
Twitter, for them, is a pretty large place to announce it.  
---
I don’t think it’s a terrible thing... not a big deal at all considering they may do this in the future as well. 
---
Very helpful thankyou!
---
The Enclave are the actual wasteland Nazis that everyone says the Brotherhood are 
---
You go to the bench and add the mod. It will be white and available to add to the weapon and armor without the cost of materials. 
---
Community "PR Managers" have been commenting today so they are at least partially back. I wouldn't expect the devs or other high skill talent back until next week but some junior devs may be back as early as tomorrow.
---
it was a rocket launcher but I'd seen him fire it twice then suddenly swapped weapons to a weaker gun then as he ran up to me he aimed the rocket launcher at me demanding missile ammo or he would use it on me 
---
this is why I laughed cause I knew he was aiming a empty weapon at me 
---
Dont cheat it's that simple 
---
I wish I would have known far earlier in the game.
---
"I don't even store much"  
---
Bullshit
---
Grab cranberry’s &amp; make a pie with them. +5% xp boost. 
---
There’s a quest that sheds some insight into the creation of a wendigo, if you follow it through you’ll be treated to some very gollum-like imagery.
---
This did briefly go through my mind, ever since all the paranoia a couple of weeks ago about armour being stolen. 
---
I just tend to do all crafting and repairs at my camp.
---
So mods are scrapped when scrapping junk? Or used when repairing items? Does it matter if it's in your inventory vs stash box?? 
---
Nope, use the fire axe very effective with everything except scorch beasts.
---
Oooh yeah. Nice. 
---
Thanks for your input, I appreciate it.
---
They made a shit game. It really is as simple as that. The only thing worth a damn is melee builds due to the weight restrictions. 
---
Hahha yeah its a must for PA users especially paired with the 200% core usage perk. I just feel like i never need to take it off lol.
---
Thats not cheating. Ignore the dude above. Yes its fine to use the mod so long as its not gamebreaking/exploit/cheating.
---
Jesus, I only carry 2-3 cores and I never run out
---
No worries, happy new year and I hope that they get back to the patch a week pace soon!
---
Do you have to power up a plant before there is power to the substations?
---
Dont need to force quit, just return to menu and reconnect
---
I suppose it's possible, but reduced damage and 0 damage are two very different things.
---
Yep need sunglasses now. Best invest 
---
This the only things i am aware are the no no is reshade and cheat engine.
---
That has literally nothing to do with what he said, and I don't mean "figuratively" 
---
Well I haven't been banned yet and it is a real QOL improvement. It is the inventory system they should have developed themselves. It is like the developers didn't every test their own product. 
---
Thanks.
---
It appears at least tied to the account, I don't have enough data, or someone with multiple high level characters on the same account to test further.
---
&gt;Does this have anything to do with the countless empty safes my girlfriend finds while I always find loot?
---
Yes, that is a perfect Example!
---
I have a second account (Mule account) and during testing I noticed it has what appears to be an above average seed, when just experimenting with safe openings, on the Exact same safe the "Alt" Account seem to pull plans from the Tier 2 and Tier 2 safes more than twice as often as the primary. I only have 30 safes opened this way atm, so don't have a large enough sample size to report, but that is  again a spot on Example.
---
As for the naming, not sure, other MMO's people have run the RNG seed down to Account / Character creation time, could be the same here.
---
&gt; Have you shared this with those who dig through the esm? I believe all  item generation is client side but the server sends the creation packet.  More information would be available on this if people find charname in  the esm. 
---
Great question.
---
&lt;---- Mod author and hang out on Discord with several of the top 25 Fallout 4 mod authors daily.
---
We've poked around in the ESM, and the String files, based on what we can see, a good chunk of the data is being overwritten on the servers, meaning some of the settings in our ESM are not the same as the files the server is using.
---
Nobody in this thread has said anything about being ripped off..
---
Idk about reshade but the cheat engine is a nono
---
Uuum i lurk here alot... first time hearing this issue. :(
---
Note sure why so many cores are need. I drop cores left and right, no point in having a 3lb core with less than 80 units of power when I got 20 cores with 81 or more.
---
I had this. It was because i was built on the edge of the map and i just moved away from said edge
---
Quit it with the game shaming. People spend their lives doing what they enjoy. Also FO76 was promised to be a game that continued on for years. This isn’t some finely crafted main story that only has 50 hrs and players know that hopping into it. You don’t have a lot of hours so you’re slightly defending the game, yet attempting to shame anybody with a lot of time spent on it with complaints. I don’t understand your rude position. 
---
It's in your inventory. Check your apparel tab
---
I don't... so?
---
Nah bro jess said it was not intentional and that the Whitespring thing was not an event but just a twitter bit for photos.
---
They are working at the moment to fix the issue.
---
You realise the most probable reason Save the World hasn't been finished yet is so Epic can keep the game in "early access" on console for as long as possible? It's a lot harder to push through the amount of updates they do if a game isn't early access. 
---
Not to mention the fact they're probably more interested in working on the battle royale mode because it has a far larger player base. 
---
Ive installed the mod that removes the ugly white color in the PA HUD. Recommend it.
---
Um, ok?
---
I found a frame last night with 2 Nuka pieces on it. First time seeing one in the wild. Unsure if someone nodded it or if it was a random spawn.
---
Thank you so much! 
---
I didn't see when you hit him it looks like you missed and he was using an explosive weapon most likely doing 1k+ damage like me 
---
You have to get close to the deathclaw and "Make friends", as in, try talking to it. Rose will then say she was just kidding and thought you wouldn't actually do it.
---
Yeah, I dunno the dmg but it I can imagine.
---
While it is rather silly the power armour is the equivalent of an incandescent Surefire 6P with 60 lumens. But the bright helmet mod is the 6PX 1000 lumen.
---
Silly but a game play thing. Same as the legs not having bracers and the helmet not having targeting. 
---
Yeah I make daily rounds through whitesprings and the bunker to sell stuff to vendors, so I usually pass through the golf club as well. Half the time there's just a cluster of meat piles, and the other half there's somebody nearby with an explosive shotgun or turret camp. I also pass through if it's nuked to get some flux...and there's plenty of fluorescent flux by the golf club so I go there too. And oh boy what a shock it is if you don't have at least five people standing outside the entrance waiting for everything to respawn.
---
Oh and having in game support give game masters a cheat holodisk and command line access. The cheat holodisk already exist on 4 as a mod. Simple solution to a simple problem the tools already exist.
---
Might it just have saved as a blueprint? I'm sure you've looked already, but just in case.
---
The servers aren't coded with the reliability of the programs that ran the NASA lunar module, pretty sure once they do \*address\* the dupe thing servers will still lag/crash/\* regardless and maybe exploding weapons damage calculations will be blamed. 
---
I mean, Hannah was hot, so it is understandable.  Though Sam was my favorite.
---
Well the vampiric effect should compensate the times when you shoot someone in front of you with exploding bullets. And I'm pretty sure the 10mm is considered a rifle in this game. 
---
I love a Soothing Voice!
---
How did you lose it? You can’t scrap legendaries.
---
does pack rat apply to stash now? a few weeks ago it was concluded that only aluminum and lead conserved space?
---
Invest in weight reduction perks like bandolier (90% ammo weight) and weapon weight reduction for whatever you use.  Just remember that the Reduction doesn't apply when it goes into your stash, so a rifle that weighs 2lbs on your person, will take up 20 lbs of stash space.  As far as your choice in power armor, High-Level excavator is fine for pretty much everything besides fighting the scorchbeast queen, or a prolonged stay in a nuke zone.  In those situations, you'll want the X-01.  As far as carry weight, the Calibrated Shocks mod can be added to power armor legs for +50 pounds per leg.  Also, don't wear power armor and regular armor at the same time.  you'll only benefit from the PA and the normal armor will take up inventory space.
---
As far as what to do after (i assume) launching a nuke, start polishing your character.  Tweak your build, farm up better gear, build a kickass CAMP, start an alt.  Or just sit the game to the side and play something else while you wait on new content to start coming out.
---

Why scrap water purifiers? They don’t store properly? 
---
Quit it with the game shaming. People spend their lives doing what they enjoy. Also FO76 was promised to be a game that continued on for years. This isn’t some finely crafted main story that only has 50 hrs and players know that hopping into it. I don’t understand your quick willingness to be rude and game shame in a FO76 post
---
Or football matches this week. 'Fallout 76 still bad after changes'.
---
Your points are valid. Especially since there are so many interesting new games out/coming out. I’m still enjoying FO76 as I haven’t hit ‘end game’ yet but will do the same as you once I get there. 
---
I do plan to come back at some point in the future to see where they take the game though. Not the same game or developers but as a huge Elder Scrolls fan, I did not like ESO at all and walked away the day FO4 was launched, planning on never looking back. But after I bored of FO4 I went back to see some new ESO content and it’s now one of my favorite games. (Although it became boring to me just before FO76 launch so I’ve put it down again. Let’s see where it is a year from now.)
---
Why should reviewers wait 6 months when the publisher won't exercise the same courtesy?
---
I fought a wendigo yesterday. I was wearing power armor and every time it hit me there was a bong sound.
---
If you play on pc this is a real issue.  Master race problems I guess.
---
Because fallout 4’s BoS are nazis 
---
I usually have a rifle with a reflex / reddot, a shotgun and melee. 
---
I wish the pistols were worth a shit but at lvl 32 I have yet to find a pistol that is worth carrying at my level.
---
REALLY?!.....shit til 
---
Honestly havent been the desperate for cores.  I live in power armor and still end up having to drop a few every now and then because theyre heavy.  That would probably change if i used a gatling laser though.
---
Still struggling with that. It doesn't explain what quests to do to get commendations
---
They couldn't put a splash screen up in-game?  That'd be the best way to let the player base know
---
I thought Bethesda officially said do not use any mods
---
From what I read EVERYTHING that isn't base game is being treated as cheating, and subject to ban. 
---
They can't even apologize for their stupidity. I can't believe I've been supporting this company for years.

My camp is just a line of 4 foundation with all the benches on it and some christmas decoration. Some purifiers next to it and a radiation shower. 
---
Always hope for others to atumble across my base for taking a break, but it rarely happened so far :/
---
Awesome! I really enjoyed this trailer location, so I’m sure you’ll like it too (just ignore the rubbish in the trailer lol). Who knows one day we might stumble upon each other’s camp while logging in =p
---
&gt; At that point, how much can you \*really\* bitch about being ripped off?
---
lot of carebares here..
---
no deaths in my christian post apocalypse
---
So if I’m not wearing it at the moment I want to repair, I have to place it down, then enter it and then exit and it’s not public?
---
Good to know. Thanks. 
---
Is this a plan for all power armor?
---
Super Mutants whoop my ass on a semi-regular basis and I'm level 120-something.  Hell, just this morning I had a stubborn one hiding in a basement that lit me up with a missile every time I tried to duck my head around the stairs to get him.  The worst times are when you end up surrounded for whatever reason.  Picked up a lot of bags in Harper's.
---
Being in power armor does make you pretty darn durable though.  I can't say I ever worry too much about my safety when I'm in that.
---
It also doesn't help that Bethesda needlessly decided to make rare junk heavier, just to make it harder to stockpile the stuff that you actually need to keep. 
---
just reboot your modem router and pc/console and try again
---
Cool idea for a rooftop basketball court.
---
I use X-01 it can be found on the army vendor at the Enclave base.
---
They did but they dont ban the use of mods.
---
Did you remember to take the deathclaw a box of chocolates a red rose? Because a lot of people forget.
---
More seriously, if I've ever had a problem with a quest, I just join a different world. The only advice I can offer I’m afraid.
---
What was the event supposed to be? I hadn't heard anything.

I dabble at being a sniper, only level 17 but I find my "sniperised" hunting Rie can 2 shot most mobs and switch to short hunting rifle if they get close. So far so good, but the carry weight is killing me, need to invest in some strength (only at 3) and weight reduction perks I think
---
I want to build a trailer park!
---
Sounds like they had a really shit C.A.D. designer.  Like the glass bottle design would have been smaller than life size to meet costs or something. 
---
I’ve got a two shot shotgun with quick reloading speed and something else 
---
Update: confirmed. Only way to get the outfit is from thirst things first, second helpings or your first time doing feed the people or back on the beat. Complete images are on my page.
---
That sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach...
---
Long time = at least an hour. Does it take people an hour to swap items? 
---
I’m curious about this as well. I have my int at 15 was curious if it was even worth it. 
---
What do I raise if I spent New Years playing 76 WITH my SO?
---
Until Bethesda gives the green light to use mods it's on you. 
---
If they do put in a hub my guess is it's going to be in the green zone where nukes can't go to disallow people from dropping a nuke on a lot of peoples asses lol 
---
Narp
---
I honestly don't know what you're talking about, my experience is the opposite. I actually feel overpowered as a stealth sniper (sbq non withstanding, i don't have legendary weapons). I basically sneak, use vats, always have 95% chance, hit left mouse button and mostly everything dies in one hit. If it doesn't, i press the button again and it dies.
---
Any enemy have to shoot me for a LONG time before i'm dead, and i have 1 endurance. I can carry 245, with 5 strength, some deep pocketed armor and marsupial. I also have pack rat and some other perks to reduce weight. I have a couple of pieces of armor that gives me 20% weight for weapons, junk, chems and ammo (i think, have to check). I pretty much never go overweight unless it's because i'm picking up a bunch of weapons.
---
I use a semi-auto handmade with a short scope and a gauss rifle with a short scope. Both silenced.
---
Obviously with a build like this you can't just run everywhere without thinking, but if you sneak you're golden.
---
Weird, I only have the BoS scribe outfit, BoS soldier suit and Field scribe’s hat and uniform...I might have scrapped the engineer outfit by accident then. Well, surely I’ll stumble upon it again next time =p
---
Did I once insinuate that it was anything wrong with it? I think you’re the one that is associating that behavior with being something to be ashamed of. I was just fascinated with being able to break down his life into activities . 
---
 I wish I had something to break down my whole life into colored categories like the iPhone does with its data storage
---
It's also a weak ass challenge. There are more inventive things you can do to challenge your players. 
---
Daily Challenges can just be simple. 
---
1) Complete 2 events.
---
2) Level Up
---
3) Trade with another player
---
4) Take photo (w/ perameters)
---
5) Kill creatures
---
Weeklies can be more challenging.
---
1) Explore Cranberry Bog for 12 hours.
---
2) Kill 500 scorched
---
3) Make 100 Protectrons go nuclear.
---
4) Kill 5 Ghouls at once with an exploding car 3 times.
---
5) Survive in a nuclear blast zone for 5 hours.
---
Stuff like that.
---
Let me break it down for you when he claimed he was hostile after he killed you he wasn't hostile you hit him starting combat and he killed you then when he killed you later you missed and he hit you while you were down after killing you destroying your armor he is not hacking or in the wrong my group and I we do the same thing 
---
For me I know usually after a nuke I will see a couple of peoples dots huddled together, heck even when I just hop in a server. I consider either leaving before I get too deep into something or wait it out. Never ends well, but is a good way to gauge if I should consider getting a workshop or not.
---
Hey do you have any drugs?
---
Plot Armor
---
I mean, the [Missle silo state holotape](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Missile_silo_state_holotape) clearly tells us that the silos are inoperational, see [this screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/tg9LqtO.jpg). This is a purposely coded state, whether it was activated intentionally or not.
---
Enclave Events will reward 2 commendations iirc or killing scorchbeasts rewards 1. Also epic legendary mobs reward 1 commendation.
---
I'm on PS4 as well but that sounds fun. I wish I could come across more people with mics to play and shoot the shit with. Other than playing with my boyfriend and his sister, I haven't felt like this game was multiplayer at all yet. 
---
"video games are now an unregulated capitalist industry"
---
Reminds me of the times video games were regulated by the US government, damn those communist days. 
---
I've accidently scraped around 20 PA mods all at once crafting before.. so painful lol
---
I only just figured this out yesterday. 
---
Unless you have a legendary fire axe that does more damage to scorched. 
---
thats not out of line with plenty of other weapons. certain ones are staggered at 10 levels from level 10, some are staggered at 10 levels from 15.
---
You don't have to enter in it just place it with left click near a power station and then hit the modify button on the power station. You can place directly in front of strangers or even party members no one but you can enter it but you, there is no race who enters it first. Like i said only if you drop it with the "R" button you renounce it and then it trully becomes public and then who ever enters it first claims it to be his. Or can even just collect the pieces and core from it without entering leaving an empty chassys behind. But again that only happens if you press the "R" button.
---
I have done this to no avail. Modem reboot, two Xbox reboots. Bought something in the atomic shop to see if that would fix anything. No go. 
---
? It's still 4 steel to make 1
---
Note from the Gormands, yes human flesh is acceptably tender.
---
Perhaps that's just because you don't have the perks invested into pistols?
---
I don't know why people are surprised at the game being unbalanced. They've done it exactly the same as always, they just forgot PvP wasn't the same as PvE. They also forgot that modders weren't allowed to fix it for them like the other games so they had to quit being lazy and actually fix it.
---
Why am I not aloud to wear a dress..?
---
I remember reading that none of the nuke codes reset yesterday, so that's probably got something to do with it.
---
There just isn’t any reason they should be outside especially since you can clip wires through walls.
---
Do you know how much do workshops get from other players in the world? I've been meaning to farm for ammo and even though I feel comfortable against mobs I don't think I could stand a chance against a higher level player.
---
Well regardless you can buff it to be good. Just find some one star unyielding and stand in water in until you get the +15 int, pop some Berry mentats and any int food and you should be pushing 40. 43 is the highest I've heard of.
---
You're a complete and utter fucking moron if youre not just being an annoying troll. Do everyone a favor and gain some cognitive functionality before posting anything else.
---
Bless your heart. I wish I could keep the Cognitive Dissonance in my own mind as high as yours is.
---
Gattling laser. or Gattling plasma.
---
Absolutely haram 
---
someone could equip the armor under clothes
---
That's actually a 3 star. The 4th star was added himself 
---
That would be the 1st 4* I’ve heard of. 
---
Technically it is not automatically scrapped. I have lost mods this way as well, however I did click repair or whatever without paying attention to the screen reading it will scrap "z" mod. Still needs to be fixed. Why not just allow us to "lock" items so they can't be scrapped, sold, or dropped without 2 confirmation screens?
---
Some mods add a star like the prime and scorched receiver for pistols. I'll look when I get home if armor piercing on melee adds a star I have a bloodied blade and equipped it with ap at one point. 
---
Or juamst group a person or 3
---
You can drop them, trade them, or sell them though.
---
Same issue here on Xbox. Every group I play with is pretty mad since what is left to do in this game (end game). 
---
Just to clarify, you don't have to complete the quest line to get it, just get *to* the last quest. It's worth getting before you actually do the final mission. 
---
The big thing about Bethesda games is the interactivity. Tons and tons and tons of small physics objects which you can pick up and move around, tons of containers to loot, NPCs milling about on their own schedules, shit like that. It's what the engine was built for, and what it handles pretty well compared to other engines. Like you can walk into Whiterun's main hall or whatever it's called, and Fus Ro Dah every piece of food and dinnerware off of the table and they all go flying, or you can go pick all of those items up and add them to your inventory. The physics can be kind of wonky at times, but the fact that the game can handle all of that random clutter is pretty cool. The Witcher and RDR2 both have an okay amount of stuff like that, but not quite on the level of something built in the Creation Engine. Unfortunately the graphics in Bethesda games seem to be about 5 years behind the current scope because of it.
---
Calm down bro it’s just a game
---
Yes but why would you do that?
---
Mr. Fluffy is definitely my favorite protectron. 
---
“People keep playing and having fun in a way I don’t.”
---
“Fo76 is a hybrid system, and no one should be allowed to do what they want to do outside of arbitrarily strict dividing lines.”
---
They will come up as Enclave Events on your map. Any event that has Enclave in it will count towards that. 
---
This sounds like someone was to be at work on New Year’s Eve and someone said fuck it
---
Yep... that’s a good call.  That would have been better!
---
Hmm and are you done with their chain? If I didn't love it so much, I would offer it to you lol
---
The players are certainly the best part of 76. I plan on being a helper 100% once I'm high enough in level and can hand out assistance. Body guard and meds. 
---
Also the whitesprings was a bust last night couldn't find anyone at the bar and the "new you"? It really sounded like a start to an event since it was started we would get in game events at the start of the year...
---
The monorail station in the south, not far away from watoga. in the train there are a bunch of concrete bags, usually nets 70-100 concrete on scrapping.
---
Ahhahaha
---
Username checks out 
---
I don't think so, revolutionary swords only have like two mods and neither of them add a star
---
When are we able to drop nukes again?
---
You must've been out farming extra chromosomes.
---
Its all up to the devs no matter which system they use. so rather than having 600 weight you would have 600 bulk and instead of weight 0.05 something would have a bulk of 0.05. you wouldnt get more room just because the terms changed.
---
Honestly that would be flippin genius 
---
Over half of those aren't bugs, or have been patched.
---
The rest are tiny things the average player is unlikely to notice.
---
Nothing has changed in  2 weeks.
---
farm with me and show me how its done
---
The burnout is finally starting to legitimately hit.  Good.  Move on like most of us did, you'll be much happier. 
---
Youre right, no one cares the game is shit and that's why the game is shit . 
---
Smh out beloved fallout while get better, riiiiiggght
---
What is the current concurrent numbers?
---
I know two places that have concrete. The watoga shop has bags of concrete on shelves. Whitespring golf course, also has some laying around the grass. Kind of hard to give exact location
---
Ok bud
---
I know this thread is a month old, but fuck me, the cylinder spin animation is so stupid. It only happens in 1st person when you draw the revolver. It doesn't happen in 3rd person when you draw and it doesn't happen in 1st or 3rd person when you switch from another weapon to the revolver. It needs to go away.
---
This. This is Fallout 😂
---
Ya, this really only works for the game crashing, not disconnects.
---
“Nothing can ever be new or different. Stop trying or wanting it.”
---
Its not a top priority issue, but it is an issue that people have. Do you know how annoying it is when you're doing a PA build and you struggle to see things when you go into a tunnel, or cave? Thankfully this can be partially offset by using berry mentats (highlights living targets) and/or a targeting HUD.
---
Reshade is probably because you can use it for things like seeing players/enemies/gear through walls
---
“Professional” “skilled”
---
True, but it would be easier to justify making the weight number's more player-friendly.
---
I really hope this is a bug and they didnt do this intentionally for a photo event expecting us to like it. Doesnt look like a bug to me though.
---
Yup raider vendors sell'm. You can often find the plans or the item in apparel.
---
Also having this same stupid issue, made whole new support for my stored 3 square large hut and cannot place anywhere!
---
I'm sure quite a few people acquired the Whoopsie disease last night while drunk and having sex with strangers.
---
It will remove them fast and randomly.
---
My blueprint is built upon a concrete foundation 
---
I've heard the arguments. I just don't see it. Sure, they did attempt to exterminate a (debatable) race. But their actual success won't even be cannon. No, that particular genocidal trophy will go to the Minuet Men (the supposed good guys). Besides, the Brotherhood didn't want to murder the Synths out of some sense of superiority. The Enclave literally attempted to kill everything with even the slightest hint of mutation- you know, like everyone who has spent a few hours in the wasteland. 
---
You classify your poops as Normal, Stalking or Vengeful?!
---
I play a sniper build but I use a 2 shot exploding shotgun harpoon instead of a rifle. With perks that improve cluster/accuracy I can snipe and even 1-2 shot scorchbeasts from stealth at range.  I don't have many heavy weapon perks but still do about 1200 damage a "pellet" per bullet.
---
Also due to str and compensating shocks on my X01 my max carry is about 355 which enables me to use a lot of different guns for different situations.
---
May be worth looking into if you are not happy but would still like to snipe with a scope and one shot basically everything while having unlimited ammo. (unlimited ammo due to the harpoon "pellets" counting as actual harpoons and become recoverable on hitting mobs)
---
I absolutely love this game and still can squeeze some play time out of it. That said, the late game is extremely week. It feels as though half the map could be ignored the entire time because the Forest, Ash Heap, and toxic Valley serve absolutey no purpose or function for high level players.
---
 I constantly find myself in a loop either travelling between watoga/cranberry bog or Harper's ferry/The Mire or Whitesprint/ The Savage divide(?) looking for things to do since it seems the only thing to actually do in this game is to kill stuff...
---
I mean, even crafting things and collecting, which would add tons of time to my gameplay, is impossible because of weight limits. 
---
The C.A.M.P system is absolute horse shit even after the update that made it significantly better. I built a beautiful 3x3 mobile base on my nomad character and although it shows as green and good to go when I try and place it down, it shows the loading symbol after I push X and then says "Cannot place Item: Needs Foundation" or some garbage like that. So blue prints are useless
---
Grinding for good gear feels pointless when pathetic exploiters are duping every known item a thousand times and handing it out like candy
---
With all that said, last night I found a two shot mininuke launcher at whitesprings, I bought the Aviator skin for it, and my friends and I had a blast with it.
---
I just feel like this game has SO MUCH potenti yet to be tapped, and I know it is the holidays but I think Bethesda needs to put their nose to the grinder soon
---
Best bet is get them all to be honest. Get class freak under the luck tree and they have basically no downside mate
---
not my fault ya'll can't fuckin see
---
pultroppo nobody to joined but is ok.
---
/r/nocontext 
---
Since even you can activate traps i doubt it flags anyone. I don't think turrets will shoot once a player gets damaged by traps unless he shoots back.
---
The power output is increased when the assigned power plant has been repaired.
---
Number one bs. All silos  have red no entry and we can't get the codes from the command centre search.  Please sort this out; constant blue screens, now the main part of he game isn't even 'turned on' I never even said owt after I paid and 60 and you then, within days,  sold it for 25. It's a joke and the joke is on fallout fans ffs
---
Some guy posted pictures of a bleed sword that was 4 star before. I believe it's a quest reward. Everyone said they added mod for the 4th star. I'll try looking for the post.
---
Thanks!  Usually i encounter them a little spread out, but this time was one of those weird point-spawns where they are tightly packed.  I will have to split them up next time :)
---
Not along the lines of perks, but I don't have bloody mess or any of the grenade perks, my damage on throwing knives is 89, I noticed it went  up. I don't know if it was from level (41) or from my stats s3, p10, e10, c1, i13, a6, l4.. last 3 levels was agility. Can't say for sure when the damage went up. I was exp farming in the springs and didn't pay attention to my knives. If anyone else could add some input it would be appreciated.
---
Hah thanks, but they can come at me!
---
They come with free pudding!
---
From what I understand flechettes basically make it a heavy shotgun so for a TSE flechette would be best. Idk about a prime mod though.
---
Yes, people with specific skills get treated better when the company needs those skills. This is a thing.
---
I've been playing for a few days and the majority of people I've met have all been cool. 
---
Unless you plan on scattering nuke mines everywhere, you're probably better off just building missile turrets or something.
---
Know what you mean. Last night I went to build my excavator power armor. Had all the black titanium, screws, springs, aluminum, glass, and rubber I needed. I realized I was short on oil so went around the area to scavenge what I needed. I had built 3 of the six pieces. Ran into a Legendary Mr Gutsy and during the fight I received the error server not responding. I knew what was coming, the server disconnection message. Came back in and all my junk was gone. I was beyond frustrated. Over 60 pieces of black titanium dozens of screws and springs. I really like playing this game and I can deal with the occasional game crash, but for the love of God quit taking my junk with me when it happens. 
---
Each zap is 1 mutation, totally random
---
Bandwidth exceeded =( host somewhere else!
---
I’m suggesting Bethesda has not been acting like either of those things
---
There are mods that add a star to a weapon.
---
Server hop/you guys have been put on cooldown from nuking 
---
That's not the devs or the skilled people, you don't hear/see directly from them. That's like saying the person running the McDonalds Twitter account burnt your English muffin.
---
On PC they have to be on your friends list. This isn't the case on console.
---
I disagree. I think new years items are just less sought after and they are marked down to sell more. The tuxedo's don't really have flair or stand out like the christmas sets so in turn don't have the price tag. Also its one day out of the year so the relevance won't be there besides someguy who wants to call himself newyear's jim...which you can't even do because our account names are shown rather than the the characters we create. 
---
Jay always talked a ton, it was Silent Bob that would use emotes to talk.
---
Alternate timeline confirmed
---
Na, I run with just 2 and Full Charge. Still haven’t lost a core. In fact, put 10 fully charged cores in a register just yesterday. 
---
Diseased cranberries ?
---
Every server was on cool down it was for New year's Bethesda put them on cool down and made a meet and greet at the whitespring bar. They posted on Twitter about it.
---
Not a very good perk on its own though. Can't have so many int perks that are swap in and out
---
I am so tired of “millennial literally”. Thank you.
---
Mostly likely something we've not found yet or the more likely it's something for a future update
---
Sure this conversation is going nowhere. Bethesda as whole is still acting like it’s amateur hour over there regardless of position
---
I stopped by last night and I really liked the floating design of the building. Also, you picked a spot with fantastic views! 😁
---
Technically, but it's only possible to get a max of 4 currently. 3 from a drop, 1 from a mod. Like the Sacrificial blade
---
Yes twice u can do it for containers too 
---
You don't have enough chromosomes for all that yet.
---
Sorry I should have been more specific if your suffering some kind of a radiation mutation or something like that that's going to show up in the effects sub menu of the stats.
---
What about Incisor, AP weapon mod and then Weight arm mod?
---
I could see it being kind of a variant of the tents. Those aren't modular either. I'd definitely drop some atoms on one if it were available. 
---
Got em
---
I found that place lastnight at night in game. I stealthed all around expecting a big ugly to show up, when it didn't I sat on my new throne and surveiwed all my holdings. 
---
Lol we've known since the beginning of the game. A support ticket won't work because they can't give it back and they know about the bug but won't do anything. 
---
I knew for containers.  Just didn’t know for loot bags.  
---
And this is a level of asshole I can find anywhere on the internet.
---
You PA leg is gone, just like your will.  
---
It sucks, but that bug has been around forever, I've avoided that place until they fix it.  
---
Yeah sorry to hear buddy lost abit of stuff it to myself at the start.
---
Its been around since launch gotta be so careful doing that event as items from your inventory will show up in it and it will eat them.
---
Hopefully it will be fixed soon because this has been a really enjoying bug.
---
Anti armour, Instigating, relentless for a semi-auto sniper. 
---
If you like running really low health then Blooded maybe. 
---
Knowing how horrible their code development is, they probably forgot to account the game lasting into the next year.
---
I did include a photo depicting the effects. Still nothing to suggest to speed at which my toon becomes thirsty.
---
AFAIK, there is one for every power armor (i haven't found one for excavator or t45 yet though), as well as for the mining helmet. Also protip, if you have one helmet with a bright mod you can turn it on and equip a different helmet without the bright mod and it will be bright until you turn off the light.
---
He will eventually de spawn. 
---
I'll just take yours when i come across you in Appalachia. Have some screws ready
---
You have no idea how Bethesda as a whole is acting aside from specific elements of the company that are customer facing...
---
The fact they put out two patches in two weeks before the holidays and should resume that pace once they are over suggests that parts of the company are acting quite professional and skilled.
---
It's ok, I get your meaning, you're just generalizing where it doesn't really make sense.
---
I stopped playing for the opposite reason - the game completely owned me 4 times in a row:
---
I was having a blast and then one day I logged in right underneath a scorched beast. I was only around level 35 at the time and it, and several high level scorched, killed me. I managed to sneak my way to my body and pick up all my junk but then got killed again. Right after I spawned, I was disconnected from the server. I was carrying ALL the junk I ever get from the beta until that point, including all my black titanium, etc. I didn’t realize I should store it. I didn’t know something like this could happen.
---
A couple days later, I started playing again, leveling and beginning the grind to gather all that junk again. After a few days of this, I was running along a road and suddenly a bunch of ghouls spawned and I died again. And disconnected from the server AGAIN with all my junk on my corpse - which really wasn’t much after that first loss.
---
After this, I decided to go and store my junk every 30 minutes or so. It didn’t matter. I forgot exactly what happened this time, but it was something similar where I lost everything.
---
The final time was the worst. I got attacked by a scorch beast and a bunch of other things, was too focused on taking the annoying bat down and didn’t look at my health. Dead again...I found my body easily enough but IT HAD FALLEN THROUGH THE WORLD and I couldn’t recover it.
---
So, I’m level 60 or so and all my weapons are broken, I have no ammo, I can’t build anything and I just don’t feel like playing anymore.
---
I was really enjoying the game until this series of incidents happened.
---
No weight reduction for rifles.
---
Where do I find this clown outfit 
---
If you check Manson’s terminal you’ll see that there’s exactly the same line that hitler said during his famous speech, the only word changed is Jews for synths
---
Nice, thanks. Haven't yet had one.
---
I've only had 2 bad experiences so far.
---
1. Someone completely destroying my base to get a 600 cap bounty as bait.
---
2. High level players who feed off low level players in the Blast Zone who accidentally hit them. ( Found out about Passive way too late ).
---
But other than that, I've had so many nice people. I even started a new account and had so many randos offer to help.
---
That should literally have just been a link to r/fallout
---
He walks through stuff if he gets stuck. I seen him walking  through a train multiple times on his way. Whenever he got stuck he would wait for a bit then walk through it or teleport out of it a little.
---

---
I believe they are on the same type of reset timer as vendor caps, so 20 hours after you last picked them with loot inside.
---
I want to use it but I can't find more of them to break down to learn more mods for it. Also I wonder is the Gamma Gun a silenced weapon? If not it should be just to give it a bit more worth.
---
can't you use starched genes? I don't know if they changed it or removed it 
---
Ur system loads fast
---
I've got all the chromosomes &amp; screws you could never imagine. Springs, on the other hand.. I never have enough of those.
---
Ahhh i thought you had to kill queens for it to count. I normally avoid flappy bastards, but shalln't now.
---
That's your opinion. While I don't like the outfit and don't see the point of owning it myself, someone out there may fancy them to buy it. That person is receiving 3 outfits for about the price of one. This item doesn't seem to be limited time like the rest of the items. This is the only time where it's appropriate to tell someone, when it comes to micro-transactions, you don't have to buy it, since you can earn the store currency in-game.
---
Ah right. Only had one 3 star drop so far so wasn't sure if it went higher.
---
They HAVE been patched, but were present at launch.
---
When there is an unofficial patch made by modders that fix FO4, and Bethesda is too lazy to just look at that patch and copy it .. well I dunno what to say... That's just embarrassing from a triple A company
---
Favorite combo so far is Armor pen + Furious .. generally need a commando/guerilla build to make use of furious as every other builds tend to focus on one shot things.
---
I found the problem. You played WoW. You're never going to enjoy any game if you ever enjoyed WoW. Sorry.
---
Some more information about the bug.
---
* The codes were correctly removed from my inventory at the correct time.
---
* Once the codes were wiped I started to farm the new codes, they ended up being the same as last weeks.
---
* the words stayed on the board until ~ 9PM PST and then they [disappeared](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/495059295747047435/529595238822576128/unknown.png?width=956&amp;height=317) it says both completed and incomplete on the wall.
---
* Access to the silos is also being denied.
---
* You cannot [search](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/495059295747047435/529595501037879316/unknown.png) for more code pieces.

* The missile silo [holotape](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/520068450597601314/529706262942973952/ScreenShot7.png) shows that they are temporarily unavailable. for 9+ hours now.
---
Oh shit. Thanks man 
---
I dont think I do. I just started to use other weapons after noticing rifles and shotguns had way more damage..
---
Gotcha. Thanks man
---
I fucking love u
---
Yea I was curious on if it stacks with the extra Int or if the extra int has no effect on the % provided by the perk. 
---
I dont know. weight seems like it would make more sense to people than "space" since they cant see into the inter-dimensional pocket they are storing everything into.
---
though I do like the idea of pack rat (or some other perk) letting you make larger bulked items. if nothing else it would make sorting your stash box easier and save on plastic. I need that for my shotgun shells damn it!
---
Thank you very much.

You can get 4\* by adding specific mods. 
---
For example, I have a 3\* machete, then i found the sacrificial blade mod. Once I installed it, the weapon was bumped up to 4\*
---
Or take a picture with your phone.
---
No problem
---
what lvl are you
---
Not the person you’re arguing with, but for perspective: you can become fluent in a foreign language in 500 hours, and completely master it like a native speaker in 2000.
---
I’ve had friends in living situations like yours. Getting a different perspective from others annoyed them at first, but ended up changing their life.
---
Ponder or downvote as you will.
---
The pudding contains monosodium glutamate. 
---
They just won't do it. 
---
The closest you'll get is private servers 
---
Which mod is that?
---
btw, i know that pc has mods but i'm talking about an in-game way to add custom radio stations
---
Haha "Whoops, wow, the nuke silos coincidently went offline while we were trying to get people to take photos to give free promotion to our game! Wow! We'll look into that!"
---
You are assuming I do nothing else at all. And, it's none of your fucking business. 
---
YOU GET OUT OF HERE!!!
---
Right, these are better kinds of challenges. Each of them can be worked towards.
---
"Level up wearing X" locks you out of high level content, like nuke zones, because you cannot *control* when you'd level up. Of course, you might say "but you have your exp meter", however even with that you cannot jump out of PA in the middle of the nuke zone when exp meter is almost full and continue killing lv 60+ enemies in your beer hat.
---
So I'm not against challenges, but only against challenges which requires to take care "not to do something" (hit a level up while wearing PA) while enjoying the game.
---
Are you willing to pay for your private server? 15$/month is a fair rate.
---
By Alien they mean the Zetas
---
Sounds like you were strongarmed into buying it from him.  Actual griefers aren't punished by Beth, unless they use hateful slurs, threats to your life, etc.  He used your fear and naivety to force the trade and make some caps for a weapon that is unfortunately broken and not worth it.  What he did could be considered griefing, but again, Beth won't do anything about it unless it falls into hate speech or threats of bodily harm(to you the person, not your character).  And even that would need video proof, as anyone could simply claim another used hate speech towards them/threatened them.
---
It'll be interesting to see how they implement the player vending they mentioned coming up soon.
---
Hey, this sounds awfully similar to divulging fishing secrets in poe.
---
It's edited.. it took ages to load in lol
---
This is due to you using Class Freak, as it makes some of the negative mutation effects reduce SPECIAL stats by non-whole numbers. The game has trouble handling non-whole SPECIAL numbers and it causes certain things to bug out like the Barbarian perk.
---
Darn
---
I don't think it's in game yet
---
Oh, great. More Class Freak bugs.
---
I will not play that game. Ark is and never will be finished. It’s got so many broken mechanics, and they never tried to solve them, they just pushed DLC. Now they have realized that the game is dying, and moved on to Atlas, which will have the old problems and new ones. If the Devs behind Ark are involved, it’s probably not ever going to work well. 
---
I'd punch my grandma for a nuka-cola and some cram.
---
Is your friend the CEO of Nestlé or something? Wtf.
---
I'd hate to do the well actually game but, I just read all of Maxson's terminal entries and there is actually nothing about synths at all. Even in the entry about Danse. http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/The_Prydwen_terminal_entries
---
No. I used bolt action pipe pistol and pipe revolver pistol early on, before I had access to plenty of .44 ammo. I didn't ever do that pipe rifle using pistol and rifle perks exploit, because it is clearly unintended, and I didn't think it was worse to build a character around a bug that may or may not get removed at any given patch. Besides the fact that a vats/gunslinger build already has way too many perks to take without trying half your points on squeezing rifle perks in.
---
Haha whoops! Our end-game mechanic shut down while were arranging a free promotion event! Wowee, we'll look into that right after we've got enough submitted pictures!
---
I hope not.
---
Been There, but I used my cameleon armor and silenced sniper to destroy every turret and extractor at the food factory, that level +100 and his lvl 68 friend left after 20 minutes of looking for me jaja 
---
Nope. The none diseases ones. South of Watoga there’s a place called Sunrise Field. There’s a queen Mirelurk there in water &amp; there’s 10-15 cranberries in the water you can harvest. 
---
That's not a sword though, it's a machete with the sacrificial blade mod. That's the most well known one
---
Im not defending the lack/type of content in the game. I completely agree but, is 200hrs of play time maybe just good? As in, I got my 200hrs worth of time, hope they add rich content updates that extend my play in the future?
---
Then mysterious stranger isn’t the cause
---
Eventually a game runs out of content, especially online games that are primarily PvE since you are dependant on the devs to add new content.
---
Take a break, changes happen, content gets added, and eventually there is more to experience and play again. Untill such a point where you run out of what is new and go on a break again. 
---
I'd say that is pretty standard.
---
I can make the automatic barrel if you want
---
That’s the risk of early adoption
---
It was a three star weapon with the sacraficial blade mod on it that adds bleed and poison as a legendary effect.  I bought two off a guy for 10 caps each.   The vendor in harpers ferry sells the mod for 110 caps.
---
Cool, can I add you on ps4?
---
Y’all*. You+all. Y’all. 
---
Username checks out.
---
Specifically its egghead and/or herd mentality with class freak that will kill barbarian and evasive will only bug with herd mentality + class freak iirc.
---
You fucking MONSTER
---
Did we play yesterday? A lvl 150ish invited me yesterday and gave me some random food. he looked like you! im lvl 50 so probably not.
---
Because there is no point of reviewing something again if it hasn't changed hardly. If it has been a while since the last article or video it would be a different experience which would call for another video or article. I'm not saying that the reviews have to be good, i'm saying that it should stop being circle jerked.
---
I have ny house built in thr same spot. Top right corner of the map, it is beautiful and secluded!
---
End game is like end game for diablo games.. farming for gear.
---
Are you on PC? I can share the perk and we could test it in a couple minutes.
---
So Class Freak removes the negative benefits?    
---
Where is the best place to get them and have that shower nearby?
---
considering how they still haven't removed duping I will not be surprised if they don't fix it for two weeks.
---
Stealth sniper since launch. Even when creeping through areas with enemies 40+ levels higher than me I never get caught until I attack. Extremely viable, especially for big game hunting. 
---
Wildcard/Ark has been brought up twice at least now. 
---
That’s a company, and a game that deserves serious criticism over their business practices and lack of attention to their game.
---
Emmett mountain disposal site or blackwater mine both have the barrels and a shower right beside
---
all y'all'll gotta do is look at the "stars" in game to see they're diamonds. like it's not hard holmes
---
You have to have raw squirrel in your inventory and approach them while unarmed.  An option shows up to offer them a treat when they get close to you, then they turn non-hostile and hug you instead.
---
i did not know this! awesome!
---
The standalone guide book has the Zetas listed as a specific enemy type. They supposedly come in four level variants with different prefixes. 
---
I have yet to see one in game. 
---
Dibs?
---
Woohoo
---
Thanks to everyone who answered. Let me explain again. I cannot find a vendor who will buy them. They are silver scraps not ore, and you cannot bulk silver scraps.
---
Very nice place? Being in white springs you get nuked a lot or are you just outside it
---
I don’t say that I don’t like BoS they are awesome as a faction I love that power armor style and everything. 
---
It explains exactly which quests to do and what to kill. Any enclave quest event, like Bots on Parade, Dropped Connection, etc and any Scorchbeast or legendary creature will give you a commendation. The enclave events will say "Enclave event: Dropped Connection, Harper's Ferry" as an example.
---
Ahh yes!! I forgot to include that.
---
Which vendor? I've tried several and none of them wants to buy silver.
---
Yes a couple remain. Ill buzz when i get on. 
---
I'm on Xbox. So no mods for me. Besides... I don't want to have to write an Essay.
---
Which vendor bot? The ones I've tried won't let me sell to them. 
---
I wish you could "Inspect" weapons when trading with another player.  The inspect button turns into the "request item" button.  So far I haven't been scammed into buying the wrong weapon but I'd feel much better if I could see all Legendary perks before buying.
---
He didn’t get a notification, reply to his comment not your own post lol
---
Wat? Honestly it sounds great.  Thwre are already a ton that have to be swapped out.  Whats one more going to do
---
I’m on Xbox so I don’t know what R translates to. :)
---
Proof or it didn't happen
---
Hrrrm okay, I was referring to you saying that “PvP would be balanced if it didn’t do fatal slap damage”. And I’m not trying to trying to pick fights, but I think it’s unfair for you to comment on this post if you haven’t had pvp fights. Maybe you have but based on the comment I’m replying to it seems like you haven’t.  (That being said, thanks for discussing with me and not just downvoting!)
---
I haven't yet had an enclave event, hence why i am questioning it. I have killed hundreds of legendary creatures, none of which have given me any commendations. I will not avoid scorch beasts anymore now though.
---
$60 is six months of Netflix. Immeasurable number of shows with production teams to choose from. Countless hours of entertainment. Casual viewers forever satisfied with something they’ll find. Same with HBO, or Sportsball superfan packages.
---
People are demanding levels of immersive entertainment from property franchises they love that arguably can’t be sustained. We’re either consuming it faster than it can be produced, or we’re overwhelmed with the options, making company project choices risky (if new) or boring (if safe).
---
Whether or not there was enough blood on the field when you ask an individual “were they not entertained?”, and they answer no? That’s always up to the individual.
---
A quick search will give you the answer. 
---
I'm actually pretty glad most people on PS4 don't seem to care about workshops anymore as it lets me do this pretty much every time I'm on, without having to defend it from other players.
---
DURKER STERVE! 
---
Nice!
---
My psn is Lord_Snow56
---
Sadly not. It's just vanished.
---
That would require logic and reasoning.
---
I agree that these features would help. I think we have a couple larger problems working against us too, though.
---
1. The lack of any type of region or server selection makes it hard for us to build any community in game, beyond our friends list. Community and player driven economy are connected.
---
2. With only 24 players per server, and no way to force server hop other than waiting at the main menu for 10 mins, “shopping” is going to be tougher than it should be.
---
My $0.02
---
Paid $60 and got 200+ hours out of the game.  
---
Why do people insist on making a post ranting about not liking it anymore.  You liked it for 200 hours.  You are having trouble looking back on what you liked about it because you're bored now, that's fine.  You can see some flaws I guess, again now that you're bored, but the rest of this just seems unnecessary, or a plug for Assassins Creed Odyssey which is clearly your new game of choice (Hey it's mine too, but again, no reason to make this post).  
---
I dunno, just tired of seeing these.  It's like when people finally exhaust a game they decide to justify not playing it anymore by saying oh well it sucks.  
---
If it really sucked you wouldn't have put 200 hours into it.  You can refute that if you want, but that is the bottom line.
---
There's actually a max level?? What is it?
---
This has happened to me. Lost some good bits of armor in a row before I gave up. 
---
Uhm... Well basically forget the fallout experience you know. If you're playing alone the wasteland can get veeerrryyyy lonely when you're done with the campaign. Don't use energy weapons bc they are unbearably weak, and power armor is your best friend but fusion cores are not. Save your caps bc fast traveling costs caps depending on how far, and like always LOOT EVERYTHING
---
They can pass it off as whatever they want IF they get it fixed in a timely manner, otherwise there will be nobody left to care by the time it does get fixed.
---
Bandwith is exceeded!  Can you repost it somewhere else like imgur?
---
They produce 10 by default. If you've done the associated 'Power Up' event, and that plant is currently active on your instance, it's 100.
---
There no talking from youre character so the decision making is gone, but on the other hand tactical thinking is way up. Play smart not hard 
---
This is cool good for u
---
(Dont want it, have one)
---
&gt;  there is no point of reviewing something again if it hasn't changed hardly.
---
But wait:
---
&gt;its not like it has gotten worse or had no improvement because **it has had a lot of improvements.**
---
Make your mind up
---
I can tell you 100% these dacks didn't make that server-side and requires a new build to update the code.
---
Xbox and none of the silos work.  Tried multiple servers and met other along the way with the same issue. 
---
Don’t do what you just did
---
Nope, I believe it should give a standard 10 power. But if the proper power plant is powered I think it grant's up to 100 power.
---
What sorcery is this?! Many thanks for the PSA fellow vault dweller 
---
What level are you?
---
My will...  surprisingly something I've considered writing after this incident!  :(
---
The only 3 star I found was a named 3-claw Deathclaw Gauntlet. I think "Rosie" is the name of it. I don't have a picture but can get one.
---
61 at the minute. 
---
Weesnaw
---
No reason not to use the Auto grenade launcher over it, which is one of the best vanilla (non-legendary) weapons in the game. I run explosives and wreck everything.
---
Of course, there is weapon tiers in every category. No reason to use the single action or .44 when you got the western. No reason to use the Assault rifle when you got a handmade. No reason to use a hunting rifle when you got a lever action. No reason to use energy weapons at all. 
---
Basically all the weapons need tweaks, but there will always be the "better" weapon in each category.
---
BGS can expand upon balance and the legendary system by doing something similar to Riven Mods in Warframe
---
I can make some gamma guns for you if you need to, what’s your console?
---
I would very much like a "point at the ground" emote for when I drop a bag of shit for people
---
I thought they planned on doing this? I don’t remember. But it’s almost avoidable so, this seems unnecessary... but it’s almost aggravating enough to justify it? It’s weird, the PvP isn’t annoying because it’s almost non-existent, but when it does happen it’s trash.
---
How pathetic of them. :(
---
Sure would start off my year well.
---
He did keep saying I added that one myself. I added it myself but wouldn’t tell me how. So I was completely lost on how it all happened. 
---
They "accidentally" forgot to renew the codes.
---
Sorry to hear you fell victim to this as well. :(
---
1. Resources matter from almost ALL junk now
---
2. Vats isn't slow mo
---
3. No companions (except other players on the server)
---
4. weight balance and storage isn't as lucrative
---
5. Vendors for factions have a 1 day cap limit each of 200 caps (6 diff vendors total)
---
6. Crafting things like stims and chems is easier
---
7. You can mutate from radiation
---
8. Quests will be coming from robot NPCs, letters, terminals, and Holo taps (no cinematics, etc)
---
Happy New Year!
---
The only ones I've found were from supply drops or treasure maps
---
I actually have a correction. I just read all the files from all the Brotherhood in Fallout 4. There are barely any entries at all about Synths, and the 2 or 3 that mention them at all are completely scientific. In fact, there are only 2 semi-racist things I can see at all. One is calling Danse "it" after finding out he is a synth. The other is about exterminating feral ghouls- very specifically feral ghouls. There isn't even anything even semi racist towards Super Mutants.
---
Sorry to hear you were bitten by this beast. :(
---
I think this is less user error and more design fault. The whole system is baffling and hard for anybody new. 
---
The buggy is bugged. No way!

Jess said it was not intended and they are currently trying to figure out what is going on.
---
This would have been better if you put into the xbox subreddit as most people already have a copy
---
Thank you for that mate. Looks like I’ll be getting that once I’m lvl 46 :) 
---
Happy new year!! Would really enjoy playing some 76 buddy!! 
---
That's a deception tactic they use in grocery stores like saying 3 for 6 dollars when they are priced at 2 dollars a pop anyway. I know for a fact there are a few wearable's around 2-300 caps. Bundle them together you can throw an 800 caps price tag on that too. Its all the underwhelming clothing but them bundled i bet would increase in sales. 
---
My point to this isn't just about if i personally find it appealing or not. But just that it's normally priced and as such im willing to bet the price on easter items to be between new years and  christmas. Then summer items to be rather high again. 
---
Yeah luckily for me i was only level 18 when i first came across this issue near release. I would be more annoyed losing what you lost bud.
---
That’s a point, I guess. But, there’s plenty of other reasons to buy this. Like I said in my post, I would love to have a good PvP system but it’s either not there or awful. I wish they would just choose to either make it better or get rid of it. This grey zone of a PvP system is not enjoyable.
---
Thank you. I’m just now starting to run PA, and will look to grab this. 
---
Did not no that. Thx  
---
Yeah, you read those thongs.
---
Slick!
---
It doesn't need removed, the balancing part is easy enough...the issue is greed. They want to maximize profits on the items and make the free atoms irrelevant so they hike prices up to compensate which is where they went wrong. People are actually more willing to buy microtransaction items if they are given some currency for free as a way to entice them into buying. So leaving it in game is the better choice on both end but they need to quit jacking up the prices to try and make up for it. They may not sell for high prices but they will sell more which is the big thing.
---
With that being said, like ranluka also said they need to release more items to choose from but for a slightly different reason. Even if they are just different colored variants of the same thing. The cheaper items are the quicker people get what they want whether through free atoms or paid. So adding new stuff more frequently not only gives those who spend money more options but it also dries out the free atoms players receive; meaning if they want something new they will need to pay or wait until they can farm more free atoms. If they wait then they fall behind on getting newer items, further enticing them to buy atoms to get what they want now instead of waiting weeks or possibly months.
---
But that’s what’s frustrating to me. Beth has cut us off at the knees by no *longer allowing us to actually interact with anything*. 
---
It sounds stupid, but I always made my own housing in 3 and Vegas with the ability to manipulate objects. We can’t do that anymore. And I’ve come to the realization that it has drained a large portion of my “Fallout-flavored” enjoyment away.
---
Me throwing a grenade at an enemy than another player walking on to it isn't me engaging in PVP. That's another player taking advantage of Bethesdas shitty PVP system.
---
Damn! Thanks for the heads up! 
---
Heavy combat Is better but only heavy, combat armor comes in heavy, sturdy and light. I believe Marine is caught after for it's simplicity in trading and hunting for with legendaries as there is only 1 type of Marine afaik. 
---
A lot of it is hunting for legendaries with the correct prefixes you want, then focusing on getting those prefixes on the type of armor you want.
---
Why not? I have friend who would like this.
---
Well this is odd too, because what happens to sneaky sniper builds? Snipers are SUPPOSED to be tag it then bag it, but then if something has a huge amount of health, it just kindof feels like you have a P-shooter and it doesn’t become very fun. 
---
Nah Xbox 
---
He might be right, with how weird things are in the game, ive only seen one 4*, and that was a modded machete lol, but if their saving 4* and 5* for vaults being opened, then im afraid how crappy they'll be, since vaults dont really have some of the weapons and armor a wasteland has 
---
Do you guys know if LUCK affects the chances to get higher star legendary items?
---
Charisma affects prices along with the charisma perks. You could have armour or chems affecting charisma. Other than that i dobt know. 
---
First of all just because something has a lot of improvements doesn't mean it has changed significantly. I put it there to emphasize how even though its getting fixed it still has a long way to go. Also what was your point hear.
---
I wanted to rebuild a portion of my camp, so I stored everything (as I did a million times before), including a decontamination arc, walls, and some other stuff including a lawn flamingo. When I moved to the spot I desired to build in and reopened the build menu, I found that only the flamingo was in the "stored" tab.
---
I could not care less about the walls and whatnot, but the goddamn deco arc is an enormously expensive item to craft, and now it's just gone?!
---
Hopping servers didn't fix it. I noticed a similar situation before, when I **stored items and I could not find in in the stored tab anymore**. I thought I scrapped it by accident - now it's clear something is going on there.
---
I have turrets also.

Damn, I was just going to hop online. Thanks for this 
---
The farm station near flatwoods has a breaker that if watoga power station is powered up it'll get a bonus 
---
OK. It's all good. You are still trying to define win terms. If I wanted to "win", I could choose to play melee with the perfect combination of mutations and perks. But I don't. The only thing that you would alleviate me of, is to be me.
---
I don't mind having conversations, we can keep talking about this. It's a dialogue, I'm not trying to win it. Just like life, man. I'm in the process of selling most of what I own. People are like, you have to have this, you have to have that. No, I don't. I just have to be me.
---
I don't think that you know what the word misinformed means. Or lazy. Or understand that there is not just winning or losing, but being exactly what you want without measuring yourself against someone else's beliefs.
---
But you be you.

They are extremely rare i think

Yepperz.

Thanks!!

Took me a while to understand the trading system
---
Same  also PC
---
it doesn't appear at all, it's not a matter of where to place, but how to make it appear
---
I’ve dealt with that. It’s pretty annoying. 
---
Rifles have it rough not having any perk cards to reduce weight.
---
Non-p/a carry weight I'm around 320lb,  with my xo1, \~360?  Its all about weight management, weight perks, and bonus's (certain legendary armor drops the weight of all weapons).  We area all playing the same game and unless there is another weight glitch floating about we all have to deal with it in our own ways. Try and get the marsupial mutation for the carry weight, invest in pocketed weightless armor.
---
I would love another copy! My girlfriend and I currently play as one character. 
---
You are awesome friend! 
---
I have tamed a death claw to protect my base
---
Np man it seems to be an issue for all platforms.
---
I'll search for the post later and will link it here
---
This does sound awesome, however, I just don’t know how they’ll balance it if they do. Bethesda clearly is terrible at balancing. So, if they do “balance” it may become worse. But I agree, I would love to have a few “defend the settlement” type of ordeals with my house. Hordes of enemies or even players!
---
No, just hit him with my swing speed deathclaw gauntlet about 15 times
---
Maybe its because they have some sort of item specialization? For example, one vendor has better prizes and variety for chems, others for guns, other for armors etc etc.
---
At whitespring this is fact. Inside the resort you'll specialized vendors with different prizes.
---
I have hard bargain maxed and it helps with buying/selling stuff at better prizes.
---
My solution is to not keep mod components in bulk. Sorry about your mods 😟
---
I don't think nukes are working right now...
---
Getting rid of features no matter how poorly implemented is a dumb decision. I got this game strictly for pvp so I hope they improve it. And not by making some awful pvp only zone
---
I got wanted for killing a mole rat at somebody else's CAMP (it was attacking their stuff), then had to hang out at the Overseer's CAMP waiting for someone to kill me. Not ideal.
---
Scout armor has no legendary traits beyond the trail warden  as far as I know. So sadly it’s not as good as most other armors. (It’s the sexiest for sure). I can’t tell you about mods as I don’t get any scout armor.  
---
Lol, maybe we can have a happy medium. I would like some no PvP servers! As long as they give us better PvP first.
---
Yup pvp is broke 
---
I like to visit "unique" vendors the most when I offload just so I can hear their voice lines. Phoenix, Wallace, Greg, Bubbles (I'm a Nuka Nut), and Resin are my favorites
---
I watched it reset on me last night at 5:30 pm PST.  Got the disconnect, reconnected and then all the codes I had were gone.  I was in the Silo at the time, too.
---
Code plz!
---
Yeh I’m aware Bethesda have once again ballsed up the code renewal. 
---
But in the mean time I’m looking for players to add for when I’m ready to use the nuke. 
---
50/50 I'm far enough out that every nuke doesn't hit me, but I keep enough junk to rebuild. I'm resigned to my fateXD
---
Did you even read what I said?  Because I don't think you did.
---
You must give one hell of a toast.

Happy new yeet!

PSA: There's a recipe that uses gourds and cranberries for 10% xp, so I added gourds to my base, (wish we could GROW CRANBERRIES!) .
---
I just moved house last night and am having the exact same problem :(
---
Now my kitchen looks super ugly with the sit down cooking pot :/
---
I run bloodied explosive pump action, and bloodied grognaxe. What I really want is a bloodied 40% more power attack and swing speed super sledge/axe.
---
Best shotgun for my build would be bloodied explosive armour-piercing but I doubt I'll find that bad boy
---
The best way to hold him is to keep him in a trade window, so if you are holding him for others to join your world do that, then as the horses come

He will be too busy to leave. That is until he decides he is hungry and just poofs. 
---
Take your time and read everything, listen to all Holotapes, and explore.  The story is told through these notes and holotapes and I absolutely recommend them. Completely changes your impressions of the wastelands. 
---
Complete the responders training in Morgantown ASAP, this gives several needed camp plans.  Pick up all fans, typewriters, toy trucks,  Giddy up Buttercups, and clipboards battered or not, your going to need the screws and springs.  
---
Probably the most important thing you can do is try to stay objective when you read reviews or comments here on Reddit.  There’s a lot of negative hive mind and there’s a lot of negativity in general. The game is not perfect, it is fun and entertaining even with the bugs and glitches. 
---
Be prepared to create your own story/entertainment.  The actual quest lines are not that long, and seem to me to be more about introducing you to new areas and basic gameplay.  On that note there is no need to rush. Some of the quest award items that scale to your level, and are pretty good at max level (50).  
---
Don’t be afraid to interact with other players. There is a large portion of the community that are genuinely good and will help you. There’s also a portion of the community that are filing the shoes of the Raiders and other wasteland Miscreants.  Yes they are need and fill the roles well! Who wants an all friendly wasteland?

Be sure to visit Harpers Ferry Often once you have reached level 15.  Handmade gun plans spawn there and they only spawn between level 15 and 45. 
---
Most of all...Have fun. Play the game your way and enjoy. Welcome to the wastelands fellow Wanderer!
---
Seems to me they dropped the ball just fine...
---
I am on PC. If you supply the 10x Pure Violet Flux needed (and maybe the Aluminum). 
---
I'll provide the rest but as for a tip... I would want 2x part of the armor I don't have. I need: Left Leg, Helm or Arms and we have a deal! 
---
My in game name is the same as my Reddit name. ;)
---
This hopefully they will overhaul pvp as the current form is mmm yeah a tad broke lol.
---
Yeah I wondered if their PvP decision come from battle royal games... I feel like PvP/Co-op would’ve been cooler in a new Skyrim game.  Classes and stuff are more fleshed out. It would be more fun.
---
Hello,
---
i remember seeing a post this sub which was basically a table showing all junk types that can be bulked, and if it's worth bulking. It also showed you which bulk junk you could sell..anybody know what i'm talking about?
---
cheat engine isn't a mod it's just for hacking and cheating so yes, obviously a no no :P 
---
I prefer the BOS Vendor. He goes full haywire when all the Watoga bots come in for a shopping run. 
---
lol good point
---
Id be ok with this, would be nice if scrapper gave rarer mats with additional ranks.
---
Just to be clear, I  don't love this game.  I've manage to have some fun here and there,  but it had some very serious problems at launch, some of which have been addressed, some of which have not. 
---
It is not what I am looking for in a Fallout game and was a disappointment and I think the lack of human NPC's really hurt it.
---
Hell,  I even agree with most of the criticisms of the game.
---
Which reached a point, however, where I just don't understand why people are still dedicating so much time and energy to basically saying the same thing over and over and over. 
---
It's like they shit the bed and were surprised when they found out nobody likes sleeping in shit. I'm so glad I didn't buy into this. Had it been the regular size bottle I would have gotten two even at the same price.
---
This needs a NSFW tag because gat dayum.
---
(Totally kidding.)
---
(Not really.)
---
This needs more exposure, can I share a link?
---
I can set you up with a ton if you'd like.
---
Basically they said it's your game gets fucked up it's your own fault but you wont get banned for it but don't go crying to them is something happens.
---
Starched genes 2 protects against gaining and loosing mutations. 
---
So once you have the ideal setup then you equip that and class freak 3 and your golden. 
---
I am a melee/auto rifle build so I have the following mutations 
---
Carnivore
---
Marsupial
---
Healing factor
---
Twisted muscles 
---
The only demonstrable downfall is a small decrease{ 12%} in my fun accuracy. 
---
&gt; could you let me know what platform you're on and what time you saw this happen so I can pass that along to the team looking into issues? 
---
ALL platforms and EVERYONE.

Please consider Nova Drone for such kindness!!
---
Hey buddy they should move very fast check on r/fo76bazaar .
---
Also super fun to roleplay as a trader there.
---
You’re right. It isn’t. But the moment you articulated it publicly, it became fair for discourse.
---
The hours you’ve specified make it mathematically clear how all your time is spent, and the anger colors the lines in. I just made a point and nothing more.
---
Yeah shotguns only work against scorchbeasts when they're on the ground at close range and with the enforcer card to stun them. At long range you may want to have scatter shot equipped. 
---
I have a sniper/shotgun build. Use the sniper or black powder whem they're in the air. Shotgun and All Rise when they land.
---
The loot is still unworthy. A lot of people just change servers when they're attacked by the spambeasts.
---
Confirmed.
---
I struggle to hit anything and suck at shooting with gamepad all together, so I'd love one.  
---
I play to explore and to live the story. I basically hate all the FPS-play, so anything that would it make it more trivial would be very welcome.  
---
finding my first PA-frame made a huge difference on my gameplay. I can advance more than 100 meter in 5 minutes stealthing/sneaking :D  
---
You might be running out of memory in that area, or something, then.
---
What are your specs?
---
Confirmed. 
---
Yo I just wanna bring up old shit
---
Do you have silver scrap (junk tab) or silver ore (misc tab)? They should all buy the scrap with no issue, ore you’ll need to smelt into scrap first. 
---
Could use for a friend
---
I encountered Rachel on the roads near the munitions factory. 
---
Na this is more like the enclaves vision for project purity.
---
No this has happened to me multiple times. I have been experiencing an issue where I can craft the item 1 time and then not again. Most recently I found the trick or treater that had the skeleton costume and mask. I was able to make 1 mask and it no longer appears under craftable items. 
---
It happened a few times in a row too. 
---
I was being attacked by one of those commie bots when putting in the ingredients and my chest piece came up as the next thing to put in, but I had already spammed to deposit ingredients so it was gone before I could react. 
---
Then my stimpacks showed up at the end of the list and I panicked, and slowly deposited the ingredients so I wouldn’t put them in too. 
---
Are you one of those people who defends yourself even after theyve lost? My implication on the comment was crystal clear yet you felt you had the need to add further clarity by trying to define something. Its basically the definition of patronizing. Tone, as a literary term, is in the readers mind. So how I interpret what you wrote, your tone, is something that matters in the way we communicate. Trying to brush it off as a cop out is basically like saying "nuh uh". Read the first sentence of this comment. It is meant to come off as hostile, does it?
---
I had an edit stating I don’t want it removed. Can’t change the title, but you can read the whole post. I agree though, again I would like it improved. However if they AREN’T going to overhaul the PvP, I think designated PvP would be awesome. Maybe they could turn their relatively empty parts or the map into PvP zones. There’s a big area in the forest, completely empty, that you could hunt eachother down and would be designed for long range weapons. That would be cool.
---
The real shame here is you cant cook with all that water!
---
It's a amaizng spot 
---
I would start on a different build. Something very different from what you are familiar with. Since you can have multiple characters, there isn’t a penalty for it. 
---
Otherwise, I’m just hunting down plans. 
---
What's the trail warden
---
I have seen the M79 plan at a few vendors when I was lower leveled only. I have never seen it since leveling past 50.
---
I have purchased the super sledge plan from Grahm.
---
Yeah buddy sorry its a bug been around since the get go. Bags can fall through the ground.
---
》 try dropping an item it can sometimes force it to respawn underneath you.
---
》 normally only drop one item and see if the bag spawned of it did then you can out what ever inside it.
---
How much power do they provide? Is it the default 10?
---
Sounds like third party means third party. I wouldn’t bother with it until the future.
---
I felt the same way about red dead 2. Got it after I had played fallout 76 and it makes 76 seem like it's 10 years old. It's insane that they came out in the same year.
---
i got the harpoon plan from grahm
---
True story, just visited him twice yesterday. Just hanging out in his car cage. 
---
Plot twist: Fallout 76 takes place in Froopyland
---
This. I recently convinced my boyfriend to play 76 with me. He's new to Fallout as a whole but otherwise a very competent gamer. He's struggling to figure out everything even with my help. 
---
Granted I admit to being a horrible teacher LOL. 
---
It’s the LLM. Best pay respect 
---
Low Level Mafia ......
---
But that' s what I don't get. If you really thought that it was that bad, why are you still even keeping up with the changes? 
---
Stimpaks grow on trees in this game. If you mean junk by misc items, that also grows on trees.
---
Ya'll ever need help, just hit me up at Fredgarvin. That's what will keep the game going, community.
---
Level 128 and rising.
---
You get it after completing the enclave storyline it’s a chest piece it’s not all that good either it’s some SPECIAL stat increase. Don’t remember off the top of my head. 
---
When in a fight with an npc if I accidentally press tab and the q button on at the same time the game will crash  on the PC (Windows 7). I have been able to reproduce this many times.
---
That's really shitty. Sorry that happened. I had q similar thing happen to me. I really wish Bethesda would fix that glitch where shit just falls thru the ground 
---
If you are on Xbox, I think I have your leftovers. I am a hoarder though so I’m keeping them. 
---
I love to role play as an assassin( you know, hunting down wanted players) so i kind of think that pvp is kind of useless but it could use some help for sure.
---
There are issues with the challenges recording stuff. On the pinned bug report it has been noted many times. Hopefully they have planned fixes for the challenge system.
---
Add me, we're in the same time zone. 
---
Im level 67. When are you thinking of dping this?
---
Tag: paulofg1980
---
Duper’s bazaar, use fo76market
---
Which forums? They must be big to make the Reddit 76 community look small.
---
From what I have read, these items are not showing up do the coding of the item not actually having a category to go under. Hopefully they fix it in the next patch!
---
Legit thought you could go up to it and pet the deathclaw for a second there
---
Okay, this is epic!
---
I got the one, last Bastion. Not the trail warden
---
Ah I hadn’t looked at that. Hopefully. I reported it to them, not that they don’t know. (Or will fix it with any urgency as it will drive some people to just purchase atoms) 
---
But it wouldn't change anything and just be a waste of time.
---
That'd be excellent for a tank/melee build
---
To clarify, I am pretty sure Trail Warden is a levelled legendary METAL chest piece you get from a side quest. "Last Bastion" is the legendary Scout Armor Chest piece that gives 5% weapon accuracy that you get from enclave and it is the only legendaey scout armor obtainable.
---
I am unsure regarding mods on scout armor though. Most people prefer Combat because it is the best armor overall outside of power armor and it can have legendary drops
---
That's mighty nice of you! 
---
My best friend could use a copy :).
---
Yes mine is quad capacity, it does not irradiate me either.
---
Noooooo lmao
---
Oh like a bounty hunter? Yeah I feel they missed out on an opportunity for a fun cops and robbers experience. 
---
I hope its up on the list as the challenges are content to us. Make sure to report it on that pin as well the more they hear it the better.
---
A Powered Power Fist if you will.
---
While in your inventory you can quick check if it has more effects by checking how many diamonds it has above the item condition bar. You only need to inspect if it has more than one.
---
What is your Xbox gamer tag
---
They should add Deathclaw talons to the power armor as well, that'd be cool.
---
Generous lad giving a free TSE weapon.
---
No, it’s a piece of metal armor. Last Bastion is the legendary scout chest. Gives +5% accuracy with ballistic weapons, so pretty trash.
---
It’s cute how hyped the kids get when they “get over” on a duper. Kid basically just took a speck of salt off of an endlessly growing mountain then giddily ran here to tell about it. 🤣 
---
I hate to tell you but Fluffy has rabies and you did not vaccinate him. :(
---
Time to take him out behind the shed...
---
no, it's a hoax because it hasn't happened to ANYBODY. and you can't prove me wrong.
---
Monosodium glutamate it's a tasty addition to any meal!
---
Same. found a plan (I can’t even remember now what one) at the Sutton train vendor.  Just needed a few more caps, but the vendor was short, so I hopped to Whitespring. Sold my things and gathered JUST enough to buy the plans..went to the Sutton train station, had barely said even opened the trading screen when........
---
Server disconnected
---
I shot the shit out of him with the syringer is he better now?
---
And yet I get plans for it every time I kill the queen.
---
I'm using the lvl 5 weapons dont break as fast. Might be why it seems like mine dont degrade. 
---
They have one no? Moonshiners Cabin thingie in the Mire?
---
What's the issue? I'm on Xbox and I've never had a problem connecting with my friends in game.
---
I didn't say bigger. But reddit is not the spear head on this game or any other topic. For example there is a lot of going on on the offical forums, and no to only filtered by Bethesda. Theres is outrage and criticism, too. 
---
Oh okay, thanks. I didn’t know till now. :)
---
Still yet to find an explosive 2 shot gun. My timing is awful when it comes to legendary enemies. You always get tank builds wading in there before you, taking the kills 
---
Similar to how you could lock items in Borderlands, I never understood why more games dont implement that 
---
Too far gone. :(
---
For 199 caps i could take him to a farm up in the divide if you would like?.
---
So I'm not one hundred percent on this, but it could be that npcs have different special stats.
---
I know in Fallout 4 certian NPCs had special stats and perks other than just basic npc stuff
---
No problem my man its what we are here for.
---
*sets up porno story*
---
its because of the trade bug, people could steal stuff when trading.
---
Yes please!  
---
Thank you!!
---
:| what. 
---
Welp that's good to know.
---
So forget what I said playing with some buddies found out you can drop off the map almost anywhere there is an invisible barrier and a hill. You essentially just ride the barrier down, jump into invisible barrier at angle to a hill keep moving against barrier, you will float down through the map. Does not work on rock as they are placed structures if you go through a rock you will still land on ground. Under the map you have to ride barriers or poor back up, there are invisible places to walk but landing on one is pure luck. Found all kinds of cool stuff by water park, giant underground labyrinth with a single torch. In the bogs there is a scorch cavern all green and glowy.

(and yeah, I'm old enough to remember Flip Wilson on broadcast TV)

Also need to be able to set whatever price I want with anything other than caps.  Caps are worthless 
---
Yup double dipping is always good to do. :)

My build is currently for sniping with a 2h Melle/shotgun when they get close. 
---
Disabled and acting like an ass? Hope you lose function in your arms ❤️. Maybe that brain of yours❤️.
---
It's bugged. Sometimes listening to the Mountainside tape or the silos/nuke launch ones should fix it.
---
Weird thing is I've only ever had server not responding, the only time I've been removed from the game without wanting to be was when it crashed. Never had the "disconnected" thing.
---
PC Xbox or PS4
---
The mature thing is to role play a raider. Servers without anyone being wanted are boring.
---
Yeah, everyone goes through it, kind of a dmv joke they threw in there.
---
But I managed to get to the fort only dying once at around 21. (And finish the quest to join the BoS.) Key is to leave junk and make a beeline for the next location so you have a close respawn point and ignore enemies.
---
Truth hurts. That's why you are down voted. This game was concocted by money men to make money men money. It's the only way to explain the cluster fuck. It's either that or Bethesda is intentionally making the worst big name game of the last 10+ years.
---
Imagine still defending this dumpster fire. 
---
There is no economy until there's a public area for multiple people to simultaneously list prices side-by-side.
---
Player-to-player trading isn't an economy.
---
You can earn the currency in-game, you don't have to spend any real money to acquire said items. You want to talk about deception and greed, lets take a look at ESO's cash shop.
---
Not only do you pay for the game, and pay the monthly subscription to reduce inventory and crafting inconveniences, but they have a cash shop. Sure, you get store currency when you sub monthly, however, the prices of the items are heavily overpriced to the point you can't afford anything of value for the first month, except generic items. You want the best looking items? Those exotic items are locked behind loot boxes that are filled with fillers (trash items). Don't worry, you can acquire the exotic items with a second store currency that can only be obtained by turning in the unwanted trash items or receiving duplicates from the crate. It will cost you roughly $100 to acquire one mount for example, because you're purchasing currency for a chance to get the item you want by obtaining a second currency. But wait, there's more, throw in the limited time items that are worth $30-45 that you can only obtain if you saved enough from subscribing, unless you're low, in which case you would have to purchase more currency if you would like the item. My favorite part is when they introduced the extra perks to subscribers a few months back where they give "exclusive deals" and free items to subscribers. The deal was a $36 mount and free small tiny statue for your housing.
---
Lets be grateful.

I killed a Flatwoods and it counted as both. Or at least “Kill an alien” is checked off and I don’t recall seeing any other aliens

PvP and VATS can’t exist in the same game!

[PS4 about 1:45am](https://imgur.com/b7wR0Dp) (and ongoing)
---
My bad, left some key words out but yah at this rate I'd take any change, I've literally stopped playing cause of this and the lack of content and building a base gets old after the 50th time or so
---
I was about to kill my first Scorchbeast solo, it had a sliver of health left, and as I went to pull the trigger, boom, disconnected. And lately, when I take or add any legendary from my stash, it'll randomly crash, and I have to reload the game. Sometimes it just takes a crap for no discernible reason. 
---
Can't see it due to bandwidth but my gut feeling is you're talking about the thing I also want. I'll check back later to see if I can see.
---
I got gamma gun n super sledge plans 
---
That would be the best way to solve the duping inventory thingie.  But I would be so done with it. 
---
Should be a toggle that changes your dot on the map, to indicate that you're a trader, or maybe shows your camp is a shop. That way us traders won't have to approach others for the slight chance of them wanting to trade. People would come to us.
---
Since they did this I don't disconnect.
---
In my experience it’s pretty hard to get away from people who are really trying to kill you
---
Your costume is fitting
---
You run up the steps and snipe them all out without fear of getting injured?
---
&gt; Any in-game events will be messaged in detail and in advance of the day they're occurring.
---
Ok, so what is occurring that means no one on any platform can launch nukes?
---
Ah sorry bud would but me be on Xbox good luck though.
---
Actual Y2k. Looks something screwed up with the year change and reset timers.
---
/surprisedPikachu.jpg
---
I'd imagine you could use any large item, not just Nuka Cola machine.
---
Ah right sorry, been some time haha. The trail warden is the one from responders then yeah? 
---
He wouldn't want to leave our home at seneca 
---
You know, looking at all the info talked about in this thread I'm going to put my money on there not being any codes available for the game to use. Hear me out...
---
I'm betting there is a list, worked out months in advance, and the server just feeds in what is relevant for whatever date range Beth have set.
---
The year has rolled over and the dates have an issue with the year 19 somewhere in their magic list. It's trying to find 01/01/19 and it's only finding 01/01/18...
---
Either that or they don't use a year and they just didn't program any in for Jan/Feb/Mar coz thinking.
---
One of the two.
---
Excellent idea for a reboot.
---
We know... 
---
Especially for the end game players. 
---
Turn on pacifist mode, that should from what I have heard stop your pets from attacking people.
---
Yeah this causes some problems. Maybe they could say that VATS won’t target other players because it recognizes that as another dweller and therefore doesn’t want to hurt them?
---
I just wanted to do I Am Become Death....
---
Maybe special perks are unlocked for those that reached high level (25% XP increase/+10% more damage/etc).
---
Just equip it when you go to scrap guns? Whats so hard about that? Lol
---
So.. in 3 years?
---
Oh, are you the CIA?
---
Does pacifist mode turn on/off depending on the character because I use it on my main and I assume it would be on on my other two characters
---
Sadly not, I’m sorry!
---
Hey guys uhhhh dl our mandatory DLC uhhhh it's great! *they snicker and hit the reboot button instead of DLC and watch the world crumble*
---
I'm guessing its a beautiful home maybe just build him a nice cage for their protection and the protection of others. Just until Beth comes up with a solution for ATOM rabies as this bug seems to be more common than it should.
---
You have to wear the clown costume and kill it
---
Upvoting because I have the same issue with the notes. I love all the lore, but don't want to get off the couch and close to the TV every time I find a note.
---
It’s irritating when this happens.
---
I don't have to really worry about it, I never get good mods anyway.
---
If its a new mode where you make a new character they could totally disable explosive shot. Jurys still out on 2 shot it mostly makes explosive shot more op but on its own its not to powerful save for a couple weapons but yeah I don't want these guns nerfed in the current mode but I can't really see a way to balance them well in a PvP mode
---
Is this a bug or a feature?
---
...Yes.
---
pardon my french but fuck the devs for having enemy attacks fuck up your UI/pipboy. ever fast traveled, game lags and you spawn getting faceblasted by a SB, you try to open your inv to place PA, but noooooooo, its earthquake time. Who designed this crap?
---
This is a problem for me, I have saved a lot of notes to my inventory with the in tension of pulling up a stool in front of the telly one night and reading them all.
---
O from the ones i have spoken to here they revel in annoying others. Normally because they are bored or don't enjoy the game and find it funny to annoy others.
---
A few roleplay as raiders hardcore but they are far and few among these ones.
---
All of the people here saying the pvp is fine and people need to improve, are either dupers, cheaters, or cant play without their TSE weapons ❤️
---
As a raider, me and my friends try our best to have fun with the "slap/duel". We can get 10 kills a day if we try. Even though there is no real insentive for our bloodlust it is still quite enjoyable chaseing groups of 60's away with chainsaws. WE feel like Bethesda is going to fall back on their usual dlc, new area, new things, jump on a boat and go to far harbor, thing. Probably can only take so much with you to said zone. And probably u can lose whatever u do take with you. At least I hope so. I want to rob people of whole inventorys. Raiders forever.
---
I'm a low level who has rejected similar help as it cheapens your own sense of progress to bare everything handed to you by higher level players.

stimpak recipe in For Defiance in a bathroom mirror
---
So. many. weapons. gone.
---
Ngl i was hella confused when you said Beth.
---
Not for world repairs. When you are out in the world say doing a quest to repair a robot or whatever, it just says a list of what it takes and how much. Its a different pop up window and I just lost 3 pairs of shocks to this wonderful feature of this thouroughly tested and well thought out game.
---
this is awesome. great job. i don't have the patience or imagination for making something like this.
---
Will try thanks!
---
There are items like bottles which are excluded from “scrap all”. Mods really should be treated in this way. 
---
Also items should be locked to prevent automatic scrapping. I have lost a few pieces in this way due to mis-clicking/input lag.
---
The only guy that truly pissed me off, besides exploiters causing crashes, stole my workbench. He came up while I was clearing an area, stood there while I killed mobs, and as soon as I killed the last one he clicked on the workbench to claim it. I was level 10 and he was 60 something so I just went somewhere else while he was throwing emotes at me.
---
Everyone else is mostly cool. Wave hi, I drop stuff, they drop stuff.
---
Oh wait, I got another one. CLOSE MY DOORS. Jeesh. I leave them unlocked so you can rest and recuperate but don't leave my porta potty and front doors open after using my place. Neanderthals.
---
Yeah the course is tough maybe I need to go more slowly 
---
Make an alt and level it up differently using different weapons and tactics.
---
Yeet skeet
---
What i don’t get is that it’s the lower level enemies that are tougher to kill than the higher level ones... sounds like Armor penetration cools be the issue - if the low level mobs have Armor that might explain it. 
---
There’s a regular spawn of super mutants near my camp.... up to 10 of them spawning at anywhere from lvl5 to lvl16 or lvl20 and it’s ridiculous how many shots it takes to kill them 
---
Maybe a silver lining to this is that in spite of bugs, you still had a great time and ran out of things to do. 
---
I have to set goals for myself in these kinds of games and when I achieve them, I park the game for a while and wait for an expansion. 
---
There's a starman waiting in on the dish....
---
Hed like to come and meet us.

But he thinks he'd blow our minds.

Same thing happened with the quest before in the quest line
---
Liberators also have around 1-5 steel on them. Around 15 spawn at vault 76 so that’s a good amount of steel
---
This could be molded into scrapper, and it would be useful
---
You used a melee weapon?
---
I had a guy doing that, at first I thought he was joking, then I realized he was using a pipe pistol and charging me. Glad my Legendary war drum ripped eight through him.
---
Holy shit I thought it was just me. My eyes are terrible anyway but when that tiny text pops up with dirt all over the page I just put it back down. I’ll read terminals but paper used as wasteland butt wipes noooo thanks.
---
I realize its the wasteland and paper left over from dead people should look bad but I draw the line at immersion that hurts my eyes.
---
I almost ended up selling a 2 star ghoul slayer's double barrel to phoenix.
---
Luckily on the way there I tried it out on a few ghouls and realised the second effect was explosive rounds.  
---
Didn't it always have a hidden side affect that caused you drink water much more frequently? are you saying it's way too often now or just more than usual?
---
[Will you look at him and tell me how advanced his ATOM rabies is](https://imgur.com/a/qLqWjT8)
---
I also think there should be a way to turn oil into plastic
---
I'm a new player and have rejected multiple weapon/supply offers from generous higher level players as it cheapens my own sense of progress to just have things handed to me. 
---
It could also be due to their dps. Pistols usually have low fire rates compared to rifles and shotguns. Along with not much damage it would make them less powerful. 
---
Hope no one kills it like they did for me when I did this yesterday.
---
I always take my time to remind them we grew up in the vault together and for 20 long years we lived side by side.
---
I'd like to learn the PLANS for a thing when i scrap it. A chance to, at least. I mean, i'm taking the thing apart. I should be able to figure out how to put one together.

assault rifle i have this plan but can't remember where i got it :/
---
&gt; I'm just a little confused how OP got all this into Lewisburg Station given that over 1000 lbs of encumberance you craaaaaawl and the dupers camp couldn't have been too close to an existing location.
---
I did crawl to Lewisburg. His camp was in the south, in the Ash Heap, near the station.
---
&gt;Secondly, OP is at the cap limit, which is common for dupers who dupe nuka colas
---
Cap limit is 25k. Im at 20k. I've been selling stuff every day at the vendors. Every 20-24 hours I go and sell everything at the 7 factions.
---
&gt;There are 3 containers directly behind the crafting bench at Lewisburg station with infinite carry weight. That would make it easy to craft, place, and lag out from server.
---
I don't dupe. The camp was farther south to the station. When I get overencumbered, I crawled to the station so I had somewhere safe to see what the hell I just picked up.
---
that actually happened to me too and now I have to find the plans again... MA STOVE 
---
I wouldnt count on that 100%
---
Sweepstakes? Sweepstakes never changes..... 
---
Hey man, I dont play the game anymore, but wanted to let you know I never found that plan on a vendor even though its supposed to spawn in watoga station. I actually found it off a random lvl 50 scorch beast I killed in cranberry bog. I had been server hopping non stop for a whole week and didnt get it to spawn on the vendor.
---
That is a cozy little spot. I am guessing your maxed out. I hope they increase our build space. Also i want a pet bear now...
---
I better get that perk card and a dangerous pet license from those annoying DMV robots...
---
What *economy*? This game would have no economy even if duping wasn’t as easily accessible. You fucks are always harping about “player’s choice” being important in this silly excuse for a game. Here’s a choice for you: don’t buy an explosive weapon and grind away. Still not answering my question about how duped items affect *your* personal PvE experience. That’s because you can’t.
---
See how long you last doing that. But since people often bitching about endgame and BiS weapons are often the people deriding others for farming “too fast” and happen to be all the cucks and losers who are still level 30 after 100 hours of play time, there’s no reason to listen to any of you childish, naive, corporate bootlickers. 
---
You people are delusional, bitching and moaning about hypotheticals. I’ll reiterate: *Even without duping, this game would have no economy because non-explosive weapons are so fucking bad*. But keep making another excuse for this game’s awful design. Lets keep blaming other customers for this game’s utter failure to have any meaningful kind of endgame, so I can keep laughing once they fix the duping glitch but the servers *will still* be crashing. Who are you going to blame next? What’s going to be the *next* excuse?
---
This is just another instance to blame other players for this game’s pathetic shortcomings instead of Bethesda.
---
Turns out, if endgame is so pathetically meager as being a meta about BiS explosive weapons, this is 100% Bethesda’s fault for not releasing tiered weapons; weapon metrics beyond a DPS check; instanced Vaults; PvP faction end wars; different weapon classes able to compete with BiS weapons; design other than bulletsponge after bulletsponge enemies to make other weapons useful. It’s really sad that you guys are longing for some kind of playermade trading system for which you’re constantly trading shitty weapons to finally get the one you want. This game isn’t Diablo 2. It’s nowhere near good enough to warrant playing 2 years to get BiS weapons. Fuck outta here. So sad to see a bunch of nerds and losers cling onto what *could* exist but definitely wouldn’t in the first place. You seriously overestimate this game’s longevity. Here I’ll let you in on one: there is none.
---
Fuck, the people who defend this game are so god damn sad. Being so emotionally invested in such a bad game should be a god damn crime and insulting other players for this game’s shortcoming should get *you* permabanned. Fucking losers.
---
Im level 68 and I've only had one negative experience. Every single other player interaction has been amazing. 
---
One time I died in a nuke zone, and a level 120 player sat on top of my paper bag so I could get my scrap back!
---
also if you can luck out and get yourself the marsupial mutation you can skip 80-90% of the enemies
---
I know sadly my account isn’t old enough to post there. Hopefully someone here needs one or has a friend who needs one! 
---
In my experience lower levels r greedy but not for survival items, literally tried giving someone nice junk n aid n a lvl 15 legendary while they were lower levels then required n each time they all requested my gear thats 40 levels  beyond all of them, it would be better if the person who initiated the trade can make it offer only view for both people 
---
It thinks I have 8 whole recipes... I haven't counted, but it's way more than that.
---
Question: I’m on PS4, how do I see the atom challenges?
---
I really hope the insight helps because all of you helped me when i needed it most
---
I found it on the vendor.
---
A scorchbeast dropped a Dense Combat Armor plan for you that unlocked Marine?
---
I love how the white-knight(neckbeards) suddenly perk up to downvote these posts. "How plays the game different than me, he must be mean/stupid/griefing". Guys it's an RPG\* game, an ecosystem that should have a balance of roles, not just rainbows and happiness in the wasteland.
---
I'd like to see a proper clan/faction kind of arrangement, and if properly implemented we could finally have some interactions with the antisocial fanbase that is the fallout community.
---
It does have a negative effect for added thirst but with the 3 star perk class freak should drop it down to a quarter of it's normal strength. The problem I'm noticing is that I get thirsty just as often with or without the class freak perk card being used. 
---
Happy new Year ! starting off the new year right I see 
---

---
That’s cool, thanks for supporting the community. Happy New Year to you and your generosity!
---
What little of an economy there is a joke. Everyone is after the same two shot whatevers, handmade plans, and duplicating them. Until they do something about that it's going to stay trash. Im convinced anyone active on the bazaar is contributing to the shitty state of the  economy. 
---
Thats bad.
---
The best quests are the ones you give yourself
---
But duping and OHK slapping people is fine? 
---
I got lucky and learned about this bug early during the beta. Just lost a few dozen shotgun shells.
---
Yeah, I don't really care that the game looks old, but it bothers me that it looks old and requires high end specs.
---
thanks!
---
LOL. I bought the mod, turned around and installed it. Why fool around I thought.
---
 I loved it in F4 and its great in F76 as well.
---
M79 I got from Sunnytop train station vendor.
---
Broadsider I also see quite often, I think in Watoga?
---
Tomahawk I got as a reward for the even in The Forest, I'm not sure which, but I think it was one of The Messenger ones.
---
Death Tambo is definitely told in Watoga, but I think lvl 20+. Before that, I kept getting Ski Sword there, but as soon as I hit lvl 20, Ski Sword disappeared and Death Tambo was almost constant. Same with Cultist Dagger, up to lvl 19 I saw it all the time in Watoga. 
---
Bonus 500 atoms?
---
Batteries Included also include reducing weight on Fusion Cores.
---
Ill check out you stuff, PSN Rowfly. And thanks for link brotherhood 
---
they were talking to people on another thread as though it was a bug 
---
Dang Carnies, I dont trust 'em.    Jk lol
---
I've seen the cultist blade plan in harpers ferry when farming that place for the handmade gun plan. It probably suffers from the same bug as the handmade plan (only available at certain levels).
---
I haven’t spent any of my atoms yet 
---
Well KFC doesn't change it's name in each state it's in. :&gt;
---
Q&amp;A submissions are really good for any online game. It allows the players feel like they are getting heard and the devs get good feedback from it.
---
My point is that you have no idea what you are talking about and can't seem to make up your mind about if the game has changed or not.
---
Anytime bud we are here to help one another.
---
Good to know I'm not the only one. I thought my freakin game was broke. Well. I guess it is for now. Can't collect nuked flora without a nuke
---
Lucky you, it took me 71 levels to find out. 
---
Kasv0tVaxt
---
Ok , thankyou
---
"clean" toilet in the atom shop coming soon...?
---
one of the abandoned mine shafts have a gamma gun spawn on a shelf  hidden behind a wood board
---
This is one of the rare circumstances where I turn my mic on. I know they are revelling in what they think is annoying me, so I put on a happy tone and thank them for following me. I express how sorry I am that they can't actually hurt me and even shoot back occasionally (in Pacifist mode so it doesn't trigger PvP) and then exclaim how ultimately powerful they are for not taking any damage.
---
Basically I troll the troll and it works really well the more pleasant you get.
---
If you got a physical copy in the case it comes with 500 atoms free
---
Shut up and take my 300 atoms, I was gonna buy the goldfish in the lamp but CLEAN TOILET :D
---

---
I really love the stance you take towards them Topokego.
---
Too bad quite a few perks bug out from various mutations, specifically with class freak.
---
Its mainly the group ones at least.
---
People on this sub, I can’t.
---
Dude makes an obvious joke, gets downvoted to oblivion. 
---
I'm guessing you didn't see Ready Player One
---
I can currently make the flamer, M79, laser pistol, super sledge, death tambo, fat man, and guitar sword. I can't for the life of me remember where I got any of those, except I got the laser pistol one REALLY early on (like before I could even take science 1), the m79 from raider vendors, and I'm pretty sure the fat man/super sledge/guitar sword came from random loot around the map.
---
I've found a commie whacker mod plan from liberators but not a plan for the actual thing so far
---
I can't say for sure, but I think I've seen some mention of cultist blade plans. Also, I don't think the laser musket, junk jet, meteoric sword, or bone hammer are in the game as of now, or at least I've never seen any of them.
---
I keep getting told to wait for 6 months or so for them to fix it. Why would I not keep up with the changes if I'm waiting for the game to be good?
---
This sub has every possible excuse you can think of between them:
---
* If you don't like it then why are you here
---
* The reason you don't like it is you haven't played it enough
---
* If you've played it that much you don't actually hate it
---
* Haters are just circlejerking
---
I never said bloodied.  The adrenal bonus scales with HP loss, it isn't all or nothing.
---
Congrats on level 50 Jenny. :)
---
Cultist blade is a mod. 
---
Mayor for a Day (Watoga) must be completed all in one go...\*sigh\*
---
Good point. But bases are nothing more than crafting hubs as low levels. Or adhesive farms which is why have Tegrity
---
Nope. I have barely any weapons in mine, and a lot of times, when I take or put any legendary item in my stash, the game crashes, and I have to relaunch. I'm on PS4.
---
They get so ultimately angry, it is very rewarding and I am nothing but nice to them. Really works well.
---
This makes me want to smash todds lying face with a baseball bat.
---
Much appreciated, exactly what I was looking for
---
Whitespring is king of legendary farming, Queen kills for the plans and the beasties. Rest only serve to farm a certain type of flux but still are supbar.
---
Try and make those who believe that making dupers go away would resolve all this game’s problems and create the most amazing player-driven trading economy any game has ever seen when this game has no permanent servers to make this possible in the first place.
---
Unless there is a significant rework that allows an economy to be created, all you’ll have is trading through forums/ reddit, which we already have.
---
Silver scraps under junk, and no it won't show up as a sellable item. Maybe I need to log out and back in again. 
---
But I'm able to hit farther grounded mobs. Even if a SB is flying near me i do almost 0 dmg.....vats does 0 dmg. It doesn't matter the range.
---
Take him to a doctor I heard the respond- oh wait
---
I drop them "I O U Toilet Paper" notes for that last one.
---
You can always beat hate with happiness.
---
I realized the other day that what kept me playing FO4 was one mod more than any other, Sim Settlements. It made the game feel alive. There were others that added to immersion, but Sim Settlements was what made the game feel alive.
---
I don't mind that there are no human npc's, story and gameplay wise. But the game does feel dead. Nothing changes. And there are not enough people on a server to make it seem less empty.
---
Somethung that would help would be that vendors carry more than 200 caps
---
No problem my man its what we are here to do. :)
---
I suppose. By misc items I meant gunpowder and Bobby pins mostly. They also grow on trees. 
---
Welps there goes my lowkey  camp over at bog substation with the farming of ants and death claws spawn and junk pile. Been my spot for about a month now. 
---
Ooooooh
---
Im pretty sure all the clocks are frozen at the moment the bombs dropped, its been a thing in a bunch of Fallouts IIRC.
---
Do you guys have issues sharing perk cards and keeping them shared? If I share out a card it works fine but as soon as I start moving then it stops sharing. I have all mutations except empath and herd and class freak.
---
I ran across a camper like that in the hills. I have been searching for it for days so that I can incorporate it into a build but haven’t found it again....
---
I'm not wrong.  If the cap is increased to 800 you'll have the same problem.
---
Who cares? The game is trash and disconnects after roughly 1 hour of starting each time you play.
---
Old news. But I do wonder what the game will be like when this is finally fixed. I mean, currently it's pretty much impossible to run out of fusion cores, either for PA or for Gatling Laser or whatever. As long as you're paying attention and don't let them drop to zero, you never run out, just periodically relog a few times to recharge your entire arsenal. Plus with the number of disconnects and crashes, it's almost automatic anyway. I usually get DCd before I run out of core in PA.
---
But once it's fixed? Suddenly, cores will be a pretty big deal. Considering most of them come in 50-75% charge when you find them.
---
harper's ferry near the chem station 2-4 bags
---
watoga shopping plaza
---
uranium fever/blackwater mine in the event area on the upper area
---
whitesprings maintenance entrance 1 bag (a fast way to get in the bunker for vendor runs)
---
There's something that might explain it but I don't want to give away potentially massive spoilers. But there terminals to read in the Whitespring Bunker that has info that might explain it.
---
When I say private, I mean PURE solo, no one can join. Paying would be a better idea for group servers
---
NAT issues. Sometimes i join my friend and i can't team with anyone. But then i join a random public hub and it works fine.
---
One redditor said download "Legends" - another Bethesda game, friend each other, switch games and it works.
---
Unyielding with fist weapons is probably the way to go. I have a bloodied Tambo and bloodied mole miner gauntlet. Which should I try to use if I get the unyielding pieces? Also, is there an armor type you prefer? Like marine?
---
The end game is grinding for the best weapon and armor possible. But since dlc will supposedly have higher leveled items, its all pointless. It would help that if in 200 hours, I got something better than a pool cue and rad resist combat armor, and I think that's the reason so many are exploiting, because the seeded rng system encourages you to legendary grind at extremely low levels, and punishes you for grinding end game.
---
IT HAPPENED AGAIN!
---
I laughed but the fear is real. 
---
Start menu L1 then challenges. 
---
Assuming it’s like Xbox 
---
Oh wow! 
---
I think the logic is at 400lb many ppl had no problems.
---
It was raised to 600 and ppl still horde.
---
When its raised again ppl will still horde.
---
Just stop hording
---
The best sniper build you get without using pa. 
---
Here my happy butt climbed up a mountain to perch my camp on a cliff over looking whitesprings so i can watch the nukes hit safely just out of range.
---
Upsides:
---
-watersource with space for 5-6 big water purifiers, so plenty of freshwater. 
---
-insanely beautiful view
---
-gorgeous lake short hike away
---
-space for the veggies
---
-real short run to whitesprings too, still out of nuke range
---
-constant cargobot flyby gives me keycards
---
Downsides:
---
-bigger cliff behind it enemies like to spawn on 
---
-occasional scorchbeast attack
---
-behemoth closeby (thankfully out of aggression range..so far)
---
-gat damn molerats get inside through magical means and attack benches
---
-ground isnt great for a fence :(
---
I wave them over to it at aim my headlamp or pipboy at it. Or just talk into the mic and hope they listen or are not in a party. 
---
There are 5 dupe exploits, that's 5 patches, good luck with that. Youtubers won't release them until the current one is fixed.
---
I think I missed your team invite while grabbing a drink. Send another please.
---
Other games have storefronts and market boards.
---
Those are what makes an economy.
---
Forum and Reddit haggling definitely isn't one.
---
They have a long way to go to create an actual economy and 200 Cap limits on vendors and duping items is an extremely small footnote in what needs to be done.
---
Bethesda could instantly remove the point of duplication when they set up an actual economy by making a statement that all items from before an actual economy patch will be made untradeable and unsellable to other players.
---
im coming ign itsgiggles
---
Have you tried logging off and back on?
---
Or doing a [quick and easy search? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=can%27t%20nuke&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)
---
Next couple of days mate. I play around shift work and building the house. I’ll drop you a message as a heads up. 
---
I would like a square build space instead of a circle since they force us to build boxes
---
People keep blaming the engine, but it's the design that's mostly at fault, not to mention the clear lack of committed effort.
---
I watched some youtuber ponder the problem and I suspect he was right: Todd used this nonsense to get people and budget that he could then divert to Starfield. This game feels like it was (is) understaffed, undersupported, and undercooked before it was rushed out the door, and that totally fits with the guy's theory.
---
Only upside I can see is that that would mean Starfield might have the resources it needs to be good.
---
But I dunno, that feels a little too optimistic.
---
Winner!
---
Yo! Would love to gift this along if I win it. 
---
Turned it off for New Years is what I'm hearing so people can't Nuke the Whitesprings party.
---
Whats OHK slapping people (Genuine question), and by no means. I hate that it isn't getting handled, but I'm not surprised. I'm simply answering the question of (to my knowledge) ALL mods are being treated the same, and subject to banning. 
---
Yeah turns out nukes are disabled today 
---
Already got whitesprings, just make unnukeable and make the banks and shit
---
It has in the past I don’t know about in 76
---
That's cool, dude! A nice mix of helpful player and a little bit of raider for spice.
---
Dam
---
That would be very nice.
---

I did a gameplay vid of the McClintock course. It might help https://youtu.be/pn14GFhPMwY

---
When did you experience this issue? It happened Monday 12/31 for us.
---
While Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales!
---
Congrats on 50 :)
---
Private online servers do not sound like a cost effective use of server resources.  Maybe an offline mode is more your request?
---
Make sure you don't have stuff in your stored tab, they also take up budget.
---
Noticed an issue.. scrapping scout armor seems to yield no mods or plans, and certain mods from the armory vendor like polymer don't say whether they're for legs, torso, etc.. also, brawling and stabilized cannot be put on the arms.
---
Thanks, but how do you add a mod?
---
Do you have to redo the power up quest every time you log on to a new server to get the 100 power? Because that just seems annoying
---
There is one you can build in just south of the pumpkin house. It’s near a fissure site so get ready for scorchbeast attacks on the reg.
---
Me to my boyfriend: “so... I think Rose is trying to kill me”

---
I Have been waiting way too long for someone else to bring up this point, So heres the thing what do all of the clocks require to create? Steel and a Spring, therefore these must be mechanical clocks, Especially the cuckoo clock, now I can understand any electronics stopping due to the EMP associated with the bombs going off, but if we are making these clocks, then why aren't they keeping accurate time? Not to mention if this thing here https://i.imgur.com/V8gJUV5.png hits the atomic shop and tells the time, then Bethesda has no excuse at that point since we're building these clocks using plans.
---
An even funnier joke is that Bethesda still got that time wrong on all the clocks in The Whitespring ;)
---
New perk idea: Screw You, turn excess steal scrap into screws!
---
Was about to ask the same thing! Thank you! 
---
No offense to anyone, way to many people are holding high onto imaginary ropes that this game is a god send. I love the game, its new, its buggy yes, but its fun. To many people rip down others for having their opinions on a game THEY own. 
---
Thank ya!
---
Chungus
---
I like this idea. I like it a lot.
---
No I got the one that unlocked Combat off the beast, but a friend got both marine and combat off the vendor. 
---
I bought on Instant gaming Dirt 4 and Doom: delivered instantly and no issues in Steam activation.
---
I hope you put a bullet in its head... just to be sure.
---
We have too many bad things roaming arounnd. We dont need drunk bear rugs comming after us.
---
You're correct. It's why you find pre war military facilities strewn about it.
---
Yet it doesn't auto scrap Mole Rat Teeth out of your Junk Pile.
---
Hardened Mass and mods need to be removed from the auto scrap list.
---
Howdy 
---
I like this idea. Would give a rather haunting vibe to the game. Also wish you could toggle to see other people camps on map. Ive only seen two or three other camps. Id like to check out some more and gain inspiration 
---
You guys really do have a cult mentality. You really want to justify your purchase that bad? Get bent, all of you.
---
someone should actually cast a glass one for shit and giggles and sell em on etsy
---
I was gonna say it's probably an issue with herd mentality, but without that I'm uncertain. I do experience this as well sometimes, though. I think it has something to do with bonus charisma going above your perks' charisma stat?
---
Same!  I've been keeping an eye out for it for weeks.
---
Explosive shotguns are not just OP in PvP, they're OP in PvE also. And this is nothing new, it was exactly the same way in FO4, which is many years old. The never fixed it there either.
---
I'm gonna start doing this, they also need to release the quantum paint
---
then we wouldn't have to wait so long
---
Most likely it's some more bad coding.
---
e.g There's a function/method that returns the Silo Time to open and it uses the difference between the current day of the year and the day before.
---
so...
---
function getOpenTime()
---
returnTime = 9999; // default
---
(some code that does currentDayOfYear - YesterdayDayofYear) (1 - 365) ...
---
Gets negative value (ERROR, ERROR, ERROR)
---
Returns default value of 9999.
---
It will probably start working tomorrow.
---
and again
---
" 
---
## I’m one of the few sticking up for this botched launch. Fix the game already."
---
but... why
---
Quit crying. 
---
Actually these lads are wrong and should do a search themselves OP.
---
Pacifist mode should usually prevent this.
---
I run a Two Shot Mini nuke launcher at whitesprings nuke zone and shoot it into the club netting an average about 3k exp per shot (great way to get around those filthy melee noobs trying to one hit everything) and very rarely have to worry about PVP. Sometimes a low level players in a hazmat suit will still die due to my explosions though, so there is that
---
My SO is on with me right now, so theres that :)
---
Hidy ho neighbor
---
I feel like..comparing Dark souls and F76 doesnt quite work, being trading systems in 76, that Dark Souls quite clearly doesnt have..for sake of arguement or not, and as far as i know, with not having enjoyed this San Andreas mod, i..don't beleive tradings even enabled.
---
The pudding is also cursed!
---
I'm level 118, I'm staying engaged by building, trading, and helping out lower level players 
---
Yep, if this game can find a way to cause you pain and disapointment then it will. Its a feature not a bug. Its not SUPPOSED TO BE FUN. Its supposed to cause stress, anger, anxiety, and make you question your life decisions.
---
Why can't I buy the ribbon outfit in the display picture though?
---
That's interesting, could you explain how? I may have missed something when I tested it out myself, but I just tried it on a friend, and it was minimal damage. When we activated PVP, the damage went to actual values.
---
This still going?
---
I have onehit a guy who was over 100 levels over me (i was level 100 and this point) ... it realy just boils down to your perks and guns. The guy i killed dropped 300 caps for me, he probably though i was an easy kill, well i was not. his friend killed me in oneshot with his stupid explosive shotgun, but oh well, he hadnt had a chance to save his wanted friend from being murdered.
---
Also, you are more likely to win a pvp match when you are at a low level, pvp has a realy weird scaling system.
---
Yeah! When I started my alt I had a number of people just give me free stuff or otherwise (try to) help me. At least the person who tried to give me slightly-above-my-level power armor probably thought I was just a newbie when I didn't take it, because I forgot in the moment that I could take the items off and then get in the frame. X.x haha
---
I really appreciate the love people have for this game and its community. 
---
I dont see duping as a real issue. The issues are:  End game sucks. There is almost no player interaction beyond lengendary farming beat down squads, coop questing, and griefing. There is no economy even if duping was removed. Explosive guns break the combat (pve and pvp). There is no mechanism to have player interactions replace npcs. Stash limits and camp limits break the junk collecting game loop.
---
Duping and stash glitching are consequences of the broken lengendary system and effects, and broken stash system. This game plays fine as a fallout coop questline that ends as a game when you finish the quests. It fails at anything beyond that.
---
It has changed just not enough to be very different from where it started with all the bugs. They made a start but the finish line is far away.
---
FO4 had a classic grey or green alien bug eyes n all hiding in a cave, thats where I first got the Alien Blaster...Maybe same exists in 76...the truth is out there.
---
Census Violence, Line in the sand,
---
Level 115 
---
Maxed X0 and modded set with best in slot weapons.
---
I find my enjoyment and the true end game is to roleplay as a trader for others. So i run Jokers Bargains and i find others to help them out.
---
Several, I had been imbibing myself ;)
---
Is this a new thing?
---
I keep telling myself you guys come to reddit to organize workshop PVP and imaginative MMO stuff. That you're more than just a meme; more than being extremely literal to your basic programming.
---
Then use pacifist mode if you lack situational awareness.
---
I wasn't even aware that Pacifist mode was a thing. Does the game actually tell you it exists or did I just miss it?
---
I have like 40 because I grabbed stacks from that quest. I think I am going to start doing this. 
---
I really like this idea +1 OP.
---
Small things like this always make me smile.
---
all of these beautiful suggestions about how to make the game better.. lets start with making it fallout,  instead world of warcraft.... beating ppl isnt part of the actual game... ive heard that it needs a storyline... and i agree it does sort of..., 
---
  what it needs is several story lines and real mazes.. i walk into a building i wanna spend 2hrs in it, 45 to an hr just in the building maze, and the rest picking up everything in the building..  there are somewhere around what? 200 big buildings in this game.  there needs to be around 200 mazes..  in the game.  200 storieline in it...  
---
the economy is a big part of fallout as well... the economy in fallout 76 is all wrong.
---
1. everybody need to be able to buy and sell.. not just equiptment or weapns BUT everything.  then there is something missing trade...
---
2. i would trade everything i have to get one item im actually after... but we cant trade.. 
---
3. Buying/selling items screws you out of money.  Why is that?
---
vendor has 200, i sell an item to the vendor, for 200, vendor is now broke..yea... now i buy an item from the vendor for 230. what does the vendor have now? 90?? my math is a little off somewhere i lost over 100 caps... wtf.. fix the economy 
---
4. next fix the camps.  lose the budget. our budget is our resources,  and the camps boundries... if i have an inch of the that i cant use, then the Bethesda has failed..  
---
    fix the problem with the servers  as well, i shouldnt have to worry about whether or not im going to have to move my camp.. the inf on the server should know whether or not there is a camp already and automatically switch before loading.. really not that hard... fix it..
---
i know i sound really bitchy about the game  but i need it to have the feel of fallout not any other game.
---
fallout4 the perfect balance between 3 genres.
---
first person shooter, trading games, and building games.
---
fallout 76 should have the same feel with online extras... pvp, online play,  and PVE Gaming,  should all be seperate gaming within the game.
---
PS
---
fix the actual online store.. im not paying for something that is not going to actually help me in the game... example.. why would i pay for an awsome lookin sleeping bag... if i still get diseased from it...? dumb and a waste of credits...
---
just PLEASE make it fallout again.
---
wifi or wired connection, i know a friend having problem because his wifi dips and he gets disconnected for it
---
Why do you assume that hitting a ghoul with your super sledge would do damage to it? Why do you assume pressing forward on your control device makes you move forward? Jesus Christ.
---
2019 is going to be something else, I can already tell.
---
Is 2019 a new thing? Kind of.
---
Sentinel (aka rooted, 15% damage reduction) isn't.
---
The Marine Dense plan being named wrong is not.
---
It boils down to what we define as victory, and in a wasteland setting - especially for a RP oriented person - I define it as managing to stay alive. I do believe that the game is supposed to be survival of the fittest and that approach which ignores own position in the food chain is indeed, misinformed - but this is coming more out of roleplaying a wasteland survivor, not as a "life advice", because in any other game I would agree with wisdom of your approach - just not in Fallout.
---
I endorse minimalism and on my own am trying to minimise the amount of things in my life, trying to only have those that provide me a real value.
---
I have just one thing I would like to ask you. If you mutate into marsurpial, give it a try and check out the different perspective you can now look at the map from, before you radaway yourself clean.
---
To you I must be a person obsessed with optimised perfection. To me you are a person who haven't yet had a chance to see something of immense value, and based on the recent life period of self-defining, doesn't want to go out of their way to incorporate advices of others, irrespective of these advices relevance. 
---
To me traveling the wasteland without marsurpial is like driving a car when wasted - I just, in good faight, cannot recommend enough that people shouldn't do it.
---
But I agree with one thing completely, you be you and should never allow anyone to FORCE you into any particular opinion.
---
I just got Marine Resistant from event "Distant Thunder"
---
There is a few north of the Pumpkin House I believe.
---
Oh shit. I feel like a real rube paying full price at the bunker.
---
Harper’s Ferry, The ski lodge at Top of The World, and the water park would prob all be good places to nuke. I was on a server with two simultaneous nukes, one was at Charleston, but I was too low a level to do any meaningful investigation or hunting without having to run away like a little bitch. 
---
Should be swimming in resources anyways.
---
Ammo Smith and Super Duper are my loves
---
100 of each material is hoarding?
---
That's not a lack of situational awareness. That's other players running to grenades on purpose so they have a reason to instakill you.
---
Woah woah woah. Where exactly is this place? I need a new pet after Terrance the sloth died. 
---
Can you build a camp up there?
---
But... you don't only find KFC in Kentucky. In fact there's one a couple streets away from me here in Maryland... 
---
Cultist Dagger is in the game and is sold at Watoga Station, there are probably more vendors that sell it but thats the one i have seen it pop up a few times, when searching for the handmade blueprint.
---
Yeah, I figured that out later, but keys are still undropable, so I have three screens to scroll past when I hit that part of the alphabet. Bleah!
---
I have gone back a few times and always grab them all, it is a good thing to drop first when you want to make sure a paper bag will spawn since it weighs nothing at all and has no other use. I have over 400 of them hehe.
---
Yeah this is the first I'm hearing of it
---
Yeah people just whale all over loot boxes in that game so cosmetics are rarely sold standalone now.
---
What platform are you on? If your on PC I can hook you up on medical supplies 
---
I’ve gotten sludge lung multiple times but it isn’t counted on the challenges list, must be a bug 
---
Well then enjoy your shoe leathered cola?  I tasted shit then quit. You on the other hand keep eating it
---
Thx!!! I haven't seen the regular cranberries yet
---
Read P.S
---
I just launched a nuke 4 hours ago. Most servers work but sone dont. Same codes. 
---
Right I was thinking about that also
---
I know stealth snipers are viable, but not stealth melee. On my second account in a sniper but my main is a power armor two handed build. 
---
The time in-game is like a minute every 3 seconds IRL so a clock moving that fast would be insane. Unless you meant based off of IRL time
---
Yeah, first time I saw one I walked right up to it thinking it was a van, and then it stretched out of its shell and scared the crap out of me. Pretty cool enemy, pretty rare, too
---
oh, sorry
---
I've already nuke top of the world and it was filled with nothing but level 40 glowing moment.
---
No legendaries.
---
:-(
---
I've also seen Morgantown nuked... only three bloated glowing ones spawned for about 30 minutes of me being in it and there was no other enemies. 
---
I think you can add a 4th star to assault rifles using the anti-scorch reciever
---
Lol I use toilets. Pisses people off
---
I remember my biggest nope moment is far harbor was the first one i came across.
---
Like whats with these corpses here?....
---
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!!!...
---
NOOOOOOPE...
---
Been a melee i was not looking to tango with them as they really flippin hurt in that DLC. 
---
Mind you here i see them and pull out my TSE shotgun " hmmm meats back on the table boys! ".
---
I nuked a part of the toxic valley so that Clarksburg was in the bottom left part of the nuke zone. The area has a ridiculous amount of cobalt and violet flux, and there are multiple ruins with ghoul packs in the region. Also, there's a decent chance of the lake having a guaranteed mirelurk queen spawn (it seems to be 50/50 either mirelurks or snallygasters in the area, if it's mirelurks then the lake will either have a crowned queen or crowned glowing mirelurk). If it's a queen, she has a good chance of being legendary and is therefore a farmable guaranteed 3-star level 50 enemy
---
Only update I want ... this is no longer a online wanna be mmorpg and we can use mods fuck their cash grab shop items 
---
Maybe the Brotherho...
---
So unless the char is at least level 31 and both levels of Starched Genes then it's hard to keep one on it.
---
With just thru hiker and traveling pharmacy my fully loaded weight when leaving my base is 120-130 lbs and that's with 100 stimpacks and plenty of everything.... Stash sits at around 350 with plenty of all junk, gear and mats.... 
---
I feel like the people who have constant trouble with weight are just role playing a raccoon in a dumpster... xD
---
Nukes are down.  Wtf!.  I am not on yet
---
Personally I love it! I’m level 45 but focus more on exploring and doing side missions. I also don’t really understand all the mechanisms in the game, so getting helpful items dropped it’s a nice little surprise. 
---
Some materials, yes.
---
You don't need 100 circuits,fiber optics, antiseptic, etc etc.
---
There are very few materials that you'll ever need more than 100 of.
---
And the ones you do need more of yuh can get 100s in no time at all.
---
That's why I miss the RP servers of the old days, which had strict rules in stuff like naming and whatnot. 
---
I'm gonna test it right now on my main character. Trying to put my luck in the higher end. So far it's not really doing anything. I have been farming whitespring's resort.
---
Yea pretty much. Unless you just never use rad away it’s impossible 
---
They charged new game money not spin off money
---
Does this apply to PC as well? Someone else said 1-1.5k caps each
---
Good luck!
---
Yes you do and yes it is 
---
Thanks. That animation was quite a find.
---
You can climb it if you got marsupial mutation.
---
For those who are new to Fallout these enemies are from one of the best dlcs in the entire Fallout games.
---
Isn't the Quantum Paint an X-01 exclusive? 
---
I've just spent 20 minutes server hopping, every server was bugged for me.
---
What area do you live in? some people were saying EU wasnt bugged but others were saying it was. Maybe that has some effect on it?
---
I could kiss you. Instead, I'll upvote you.
---
The only character I have is level 63 and has it maxed. I might take time to play around it with it.  
---
Can you get more than 1 while getting irradiated to almost the point of dying? How can you max this?
---
Definitely Bloodied and anti-armor if we are talking overall utility/DPS.
---
I got a nice Instigating/VATs Crit DAM/-VATS cost Lever action that I would love to swap for anti-armor/Bloodied/VATs crit on my VATs character
---
All power boxes produce 10 by default unless respective power plant is powered up first. 
---
Yeah, shoulda mentioned that, lol. I like having hard copies so i can put them on display when im not playing
---
Thanks. Is it confirmed they can drop Power Armor plans, or is the best way really RNG with server hopping? Cause Im sure ive done 20-30 hours just server hoping for any excavator or X-01 plans and have never seen it, using watago,harpers,and enclave vendors.
---
For the hard copy. Should've said that. Lol
---
Yea those events can drop t60, t45, and t51b plans
---
I have the same issue.  Even against a grounded queen when im just close enough that my explosive damage wont hit me as well.  When i contacted tech support about it, they had the gall to try and tell me that my processor was somehow responsible for a serverside issue.
---
#freethenukes
---
My friend and I would have done that rather than trying over and over to find a server that would let us nuke, but we don't fuckin tweet so fuck us right?
---
afaik it's all the same duper rate.
---
For free loot
---
Unless they changed it, its capped at 1 per player per server. So you have to go get one, swap servers decontaminate, get one swap servers, and rinse and repeat until you have at least the ones you want. You can also buy serums to get specific ones but they can be kind of expensive 
---
So I'm a bit more cynical I guess, but I find Bounty Hunting fun when given the chance.
---
By technical definition it is a new game so they can charge whatever they want to make a profit 
---
After adding the .exe, did you change any of the listed settings? Leave as is?
---
Loot and xp.
---
Not true, don't spread this. 
---
Take a walk over to r/fo76bazaar and check the player stores. 
---
Ps keep a good eye open many junkies roam it looking to jack sellers and buyers alike.
---
Where was the mask located in the crafting menu? I found the plan, could have sworn it gave both the outfit and mask but while I could craft the body the head piece was nowhere to be found
---
Would you use the arena near the top of the world with the raider PA??
---
Yeah something happened with a bug (sounds like maybe reset timers, real life Fo76 Y2K lmao) and people cannot launch nukes right now.
---
Man you guys need to catch up the rest of the country renames it
---
I'm just surprised she's doing all this without a CAMP.
---
The Gatling Gun has an incredible edge over all other heavy weapons. Having all of the Heavy Weapons Damage Boosting perks, I have a Three-Star, Two-Shot Explosive Gatling Gun that has a base damage of 533. Which, four shots from will destroy a Level 80 Scorchbeast, so it doesn't necessarily use much ammunition. 
---
For low-level enemies, I have a Two-Shot Explosive Gatling Lasee (I don't know how that works) with the Beta Wave Tuner, and that'll take on most anything under Level 30 in very few shots. To get Cores, you just need to kill the Sentry Bots around Whitesprings, which are one-shot with a Two-Shot Explosive Harpoon Gun.
---
Moral of the Story? Two-Shot Explosives.
---
If you know it’s there don’t Mob enemies I that direction 
---
Wait what? Really? Could you give examples?
---
Yeah, that first set of quests from her do seem intended to get you killed.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
My stash isn’t even over 400 with the same amount. of everything except I have 200 ballistic fiber and 300 steel and wood with 150 of everything else. So someone’s wrong here and I’m positive it isn’t me 
---
1-1.5 is normal for PC and you will find PC prices more caps generally, not sure why.  Source: Trade all the time.
---
Ohh
---
YOU'RE
---
They drop occasionally from Robobrains as a heads up
---
Xbox
---
I've been running Batteries included since i discovered the perk (lvl 40ish?), 120 levels later still using it.
---
I read it and enjoyed it. Sounds like a good time to be honest, two people trying to out-troll one another can be some of the most hilarious shit you will see/do online.
---
blight soup 20% crit damage
---
glowing meat steak 30% melee damage
---
Cranberry relish 10% xp
---
and you can stack them all together with your special buffing food
---
Shh don’t let Bethesda know
---
What if we could make all the dupers permanently wanted and had a sign that said they were wanted because they were cheaters so we could light our flaming pitch forks and go after them in masses I think it would be fun I mean imagine if Bethesda made it some sort of event let the community seek justice themselves right before banning them or something idk. 
---
Will teach him an important lesson to alway have some loose steel scrap in his storage. 
---
They exist.
---
What platform are you on? I am on PC and I have an extra x-01 jetpack you can have as a Christmas gift if you didn't already get one somewhere else.
---
Last night I found a legendary chicken that dropped a level 1 auto stim wood armor piece.
---
After the nerf they are much much rarer. They are still around but very very rare.
---
Damn bro someone just lost 75 Nuka cola quantum’s crazy world 
---
It is fun and would be more viable (in fact, extremely so) if the enemies in the game were about 3 times as strong as they are now, damage output and health wise.
---
But most builds can tear through weak ass mobs way faster
---
Maxed out caps makes it obvious enough in my view. I agree about stories on the internet 😂 this one’s especially painted in primary colours
---
&gt; Do you have to redo the power up quest every time you log on to a new server to get the 100 power? Because that just seems annoying
---
Doing the Power Up events will award you the generator plans so you don't have to do them again: Windmill, Large Generator, Fusion Generator
---
Ah. NVM. I was going to offer to show you.
---
My camp is in the same spot.  Great view, out of the way, and the seemingly only flat ground in all of Appalachia.  I've got my camp set up as a fortress, though.  Two story concrete castle, completely walled off with only a single access point.  
---
Pretty sure it has something to due with 2019 when game first came out for pc they forgot to update timezones
---
Or a visitor log that people can type/scribble notes in
---
This sounds like a great idea. Kind of like ESO and it's traders
---
Same. I’m lvl 107
---
Lv307, 500+ hours. Interacting with other players, both positive and negative bring me amusement. While solo i run around the map and get people to tag cargobots so they can sell/trade me their nuke cards for stims or supplies. I've got over a hundred, but enjoy making people feel useful, getting them used to player interactions, and not being afraid of higher levels. 
---
I have a friend who has lower level characters that she floats about with and almost like clockwork others want to help 'guide' her (whiteknight/ neckbeards) and ask her to join team/party, she sends me a text of where their camp is and launch a nuke on it.  They usually disconnect/leave world but every so often you land a hit, and If it does i'm already onto the next silo (\~15m cleartimes) to do it again, but only after they rebuild.
---
As long as the playerbase stays afloat I will always find ways of amusing myself.
---
Yeah I got mine yesterday with the lone calibrated shock. Turned right there and installed them so I wouldn’t do exactly what you did.
---
It’s overpowered.  It would make it a mandatory perk. They should just add more mod recipes to vendors.  
---
Those are at the rear of the clubhouse, soon as I port in, mobs spawn and are attacked thru the window by the turrets 
---
This is probably a top 10 most suggested thing and i always agree. We need a way to know what we already have as its not easy to keep track or when we have 100s to find and collect.
---
You're not wrong, but that won't help if you left your character someplace because the server crashed. 
---
Anyway, I spent upwards of 45 minutes aligning a foundation and a stairway so I could put an upper floor at the bottom aligned with the doorway and put a door in it. Give me 5 minutes and I'll take pictures.
---
I think the problem about this could be resources, the same reason why there is a build budget on camps. 
---
The servers aren't the best, now imagine how they would run when there would be old camps all over the place. 
---
And what happens when there is an old camp exactly on the spot your camp is? It'd have to say your camp can't be placed where it was before. 
---
So basically at some point it'd be very hard to find a cool location nobody found before you and build their camp there. 
---
Also works on Acid extractors
---
Why in sweet salty Christ would repairing use the resources from a MOD?!?
---
That backfired. 
---
I’m glad I’m not the only one. I specifically have issues with the notes that have the weathering effect on them. The freaking paper is brown, and the font is thin and black. 
---
I’ve given up trying to read that shit.
---
I still feel a bit cheated. But I learned a valuable lesson about pre ordering games I guess
---
That's why I love this community. So many people willing to lend a hand. Unfortunately I'm on Xbox. But thanks for the offer!
---
If it makes you feel any better, they were likely all bad. 
---
Thanks for confirming. I assumed as much but hadn't checked.
---
also if your at the whitesprings artisan vendor check the cash register I've been leaving my unwanted legendaries in there and I've seen others doing this as well
---
Radroach me
---
Just tried Emmett. I had to serve hop.
---
Had a lvl 150 beating on me while I was AFK sitting on a bench in white springs,came out of pacifist mode and murdered him...it’s really that simple.
---
Are you sure it was "Cooking Stove" and not "Kitchen Stove" or "Wood Stove?" There was a big a while back if you stored an item that could scroll left/right to different variations you can set down ones you didn't own. They fixed it and I couldn't set Cooking Stoves down anymore, I was confused cuz I remembered eating a stove recipe but it was one of the useless decor ones. I had to relog at responded train station vendor till it appeared.
---
Lots of ppl.
---
Xmas injected alot of players on ps4 that's for sure
---
Yes! That's all we wanted to do. Just play Fallout 4 with friends. That's it. 
---
Oh alright
---
Yes... Because then you could call it Motha Fuckin Chicken instead...
---
No one expects you to realize you're a douchebag or  change your ways. You are who you are. 
---
You can actually camp at this trailer, at least a version of this trailer, near the pumpkin house.  
---
There are several annoyances: you will be constantly attacked by supermutants and scorched beasts.
---
However, it is indestructible.  
---
«could» and yes it is/was true alot of people lost stuff because of a trading bug. Not sure if it was patched but have been alot less of this recently.
---
I picked up the M79 as reward for one of the free states quests 
---
I did that too! Was interesting even if it wasn't "eFfEcIeNt"
---
100% positive it's the one you cook on
---
Where can I buy some of this high quality bate on new year's day?
---
Acid and Junk are the only ones I can confirm, but it is nice to know for those occasions when you find a locked extractor.
---
Where did you find your axe, if I may ask?
---
lol r/me_irl
---
Alot of us my man otherwise we wouldn't be here.
---
Answer me this though what is the point of this thread?.
---
Do you enjoy downvotes and abuse for creating a thread like this?.
---
You don’t get Xp if u didn’t shoot the creature at least once turrets don’t count
---
This is the correct answer
---
No an assault weapon. 
---
Doesn't happen to me. Ur internets probably trash
---
Not one shred of evidence. Please amongst the countless "Duping Tutorials" "Exp Glitch Tutorials" and other medleys of cheating videos on YouTube please post link of proof of this trade glitch being real. No Evidence apart from Reddit posts and hearsay. 
---
YES. 100x yes. 
---
Ideally they should add two new tags:
---
Junk - items tagged with junk will be scrapped with (T). 
---
Keep - Items are locked from any actions except using them, until this is removed. 
---
Oh I didn't even think of world repairs like Messenger or the eye bot ones... 
---
Just click on it lol 
---
Ur mum
---
no
---
I think it gets fucky with rounding errors and that's why that shows improvement.  Either that or the game isn't showing the proper significant figures because in playing around with it, I also only found aluminum and lead to be beneficial.
---
Ooo your far from alone my man seen this posted alot. Most seem to want an overhaul to the whole PvP system.
---
I’ve never had an issue with pvp damage scaling,it’s usually a whoever has the bounty loses situation. Person had bounty can’t hurt me and I can do full damage on first hit.
---
No one was there, so I went to hang out with Bubbles in the soda Fountain. Took a nice pic by myself, used the sparklers I never have a use for. Sat at the bar for a minute before logging back off. Of course I was there at like 1:30 so two hours late, ha
---
Poseidon*
---
ye the sale was like 50%
---
Aren't there people who do organize events and pvp battles? For some though it's not about the conflict it's about the story or the reason. It's great to participate in pvp but honestly why search it out? There are negative forces (people) in the game who seek you out and engage you. Bethesda likes to try to push players towards the "good" karma- but they seem to try to leave room for the "bad" as well.
---
I welcome it, and enjoy it but this open world leaves me wanting for more creation and imagination. If servers were more stable I really wish there was a platform here to build towns or something weird  (not settlements but individuals in a space near eachother).  What other things would you like to see in a game like this ( an honest question here)? Would an arena be similar to the pvp matches?
---
Ah thank you ill take a look.
---
the discord chat makes it more fun but theres only about a half dozen people online at a time
---
No problem my man its what we are here to do.
---
Weird, same here.
---
Good to know as well, ill try farming them for a bit, I am tired of hitting up these vendors.
---
Wait, there's an event at Whitesprings?
---
Just like the challenge?
---
I'm even thinking the fortunes can relate to the buff. For instance a fortune could say "You are surrounded by negative energy" and the buff be +5% energy resistance. Or it could say "you have a keen eye for detail" which would give +5% damage with riffles. I'm sure my examples are lame and there's better ideas for fortunes.
---
I read this sub pretty much every single day, I’ve played this game since the Xbox Stress Test...I had no idea that substations and power plant workshops made their own electricity. I always thought they had to be powered by a functional power plant. 
---
All I really care is that you got rid of it. All the other stuff is moot to me
---
I can confirm broadsider
---
Me, a lot the last 4 days. Loved every minute of it except for the 3 disconnects. But over 16 hours or so, I can’t  bitch much. 
---
I thought glowing meat was 10%. 
---
Honestly I’m fine with the pvp system, yea it can be annoying but it’s growing pains that’ll be worked out. I enjoy helping others and I want to without being penalized for it.
---
As for pvp if anyone fucks with me I just vats em down while invis...I don’t die often
---
At least we are in the post camp update. You have nothing to lose now unless you choose to replace your camp when given the option 
---
I really friggen love this idea OP.
---
Also they just released this.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/5te3GDsV1eOM2YOKoyWoI6/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-1-2019
---
[There](https://imgur.com/a/lHUHoVN). It isn't too hard, but it IS terribly precise and time-consuming(my door still isn't 100% aligned with the doorway but I put Upper Floors underground to facilitate an earlier build and now I can't fix anything without packing up and starting all over.)
---
Yup
---
Dude this thread is just gonna send people to their camp to mod flames onto their pitchforks. 
---
You think federal regulations keep you safe? All you do is cede power to the beaureucrats. 
---
After reconfiguring my TV setting (calibrating it with Xbox) I can read notes perfectly fine now 👌
---
Oh yeah I never pre order anymore that shits a scam lol
---
It could differ then. Remember there were issues with wires on PS4 before.
---
i played it like a week after it came out and it was not good
---
I would also add challenging content and enemies that can actually fight back to that list, but that's just me. There needs to be a reason to have strong gear for it to be meaningful.
---
Thanks for sharing, I didn't have any weapon or armor that have more than one star... Maybe they drop later I am only lvl 27..
---
Except the two things people wanted were all cosmetic and costed 20 dollars each. So no, it’s not misinformation. The Santa pack and elf pack were grossly overpriced. Stop defending, dude.
---
Sooo essential you are trading with other people for their nuke cards
---
And use those to nuke other players who want to be helpful? 
---
I think I must be one of the few people that wasn't asking for mmo/PvP/pure online play from a fallout game. 
---
Well, you aren't. I think there were a lot of people who didn't want an online fallout, and that's where a lot of the hate came from. But there are also a lot of people who thought the idea sounded cool, and are enjoying the game. If you're one of the ones who don't want an online fallout game, then maybe just don't play it. Like, if you're a fan of final fantasy, but hate MMOs, maybe just skip 14. Keep playing the older ones until 15 came out. Same here. Don't want an online fallout? Just wait for 5.
---
&gt;I just wanna come on and play a traditional fallout experience without getting chased and dogged by people 4x my level.
---
Obviously everyone's experience will vary, but is this really a concern? Like does this happen? I've had random people attack me maybe 3 times in what has to be a couple hundred hours now.
---
I like my reasoning, but I think you are probably correct.  No one put any codes into the database for 2019 so the servers are confused on what to do.
---
This makes me wonder if one played fallout 4 in another language, one could become fluent. Would have to learn basic language skills first.
---
Who makes threads like this anymore?
---
Yea, but think of all the items that guy duped
---
Which seems to be available from Watoga vendors
---
You’re the second PC user who said it works fine. It may be a PS4 only issue. 
---
Player vendors!!!!
---
ur mom
---
The player vending itself will be so nice. Curious if it will be prices set by users or or a global price list.  
---
Also this would mean to do this will you have to stumble upon camps? Friends camps easier to find? Curious how that will go.
---
Neat, will keep an eye out. Any events (aside from scorched queen) that can drop excavatoror X-01 plans?
---
Also.. vendors DO sell these plans right? I just have spent so many hours im shocked I havent seen a single one yet..lol.
---
Still down on PS4
---
Oh, ok) because in other games I have like 70 degrees) 
---
I just realized I haven't seen them for ages
---
Apparently you can hit repair all to fix them on your camp
---
I’m sorry to hear that. 
---
I am on xbox and it started about 1230am cst. Still cant get into silos. You click activate scanner on the silo keypads and it turns red.
---
I know certain weapon mods can add an extra star, but I have only seen 3 stars with an extra 1 star mod on them so far. I'm wondering what kind of items we could get that come naturally at 4 or 5 stars in future updates. Other issue then becomes what kind of enemies will we have that might require these insane future weapons. Definitely some exciting prospects :)
---
No its bugged per the community manager for Bethesda 
---
You can buy excavator and x01 plans, and yes vendors sell plans 
---
Oh hoho, you guys are sneaky. It's not fun when an individual experiences it but I think nearly everyone does good deeds and bad. The choice to act as you please is what makes it fallout right?
---
During the beta, I noticed that when I placed a radio in my camp, I could no longer switch lights on/off or do a couple other things (have slipped my mind).  Hopefully they'll get it fixed up soon.
---
So this is why I don't get it... I thought I was just really unlucky...
---
Now to find a replacement melee weapon...
---
Yeah. Some people actually do like the PVP when it works as intended. The caps kinda complicate it, because doing prolonged PVP makes one person broke, and the other rich because it's based on level. Unless it's back and forth.
---
Yeah the server limitations are probably the biggest barrier, but the rest would be fine. The decay of the leftover CAMP is critical to avoid having too much or too many in the world.
---
If you log in with your CAMP on the same site the leftover pieces just disappear, poof. It wouldn’t prevent you from entering the world at your CAMP or building one because it would no longer register as a CAMP. Just objects.
---
Or you could scrap legendaries
---
Jumping servers doesn't work! I spend more caps fast traveling to find a vendor with caps!
---
And if you buy something from them forget about regaining those caps back! Ugh! Wtf
---
Whats your account name/platform? I can show you that PvP is fun. 
---
Personally, I think that making that place unnukeable would make a lot of people angry, as many people nuke that spot.
---
Ah thanks. I shall stop trying now. 
---
I hope the new quests can have a little more depth than what we have so far.
---
Yeah very true. I'm in the process of finding a new spot. Trying to find a spot with more than one spot to use resource extractors on. 
---
I'm interested in the two shot radium rifle , is it level 50?
---
Still want rarer mats back
---
They exist; it's just by now everyone knows where a majority of them are and people are still trying to farm caps via that method so farmers get to them most of the time before casuals do. Wish the caps stashes were tied to individual players like containers were so you could nab one each 24 hours.
---
Seems those flappy bastards are finicky about where they land. Try getting them over flat ground and use a ranged weapon that you have a cripple effect or perk associated with to get them to land. Should be cake once they land.
---
This just happened to me too. I finished the quest ages ago and have been wearing the veil of secrets for many levels. I was moving things in and out of my stash and saw the veil, and then it was gone. I don’t know if I accidentally dropped it (but it was definitely not on the ground or in a baggy as I looked all over for it) or it just disappeared between my inventory and my stash. But either way, it’s gone. Is there a way to get it back?
---
Forbidden pudding tastes better, though.
---
Might be on later.
---
Pacifist mode stops you from getting these unwanted bounties (or should if it doesn’t glitch)
---
Haha so true, I've found 3 decent weapons and 1 really good piece of armor in near 200 hours. The grind is too real in this game lol. If they made amazing weapons drop at a more reasonable rate, maybe the dupe fiesta would cool down.
---
whoops fixed it
---
Lmao, no
---
You might be thinking I made a comment that I did not make. Someone else said the thing about fatal slap damage.
---
Someone probably left it there, I often switch mine out for higher level armor
---
Let’s hope if camps are used for this, they are made indestructible.
---
Why
---
I wish that too... would help against farming 
---
Yes it’s max level. If you’re interested then PM me.
---
In not even sure I'd call screws and springs rare.  Their scarcity is idiotic considering how many are needed to craft weapons.
---
I know lol
---
Ok.
---
Nice! Can't wait for the player vending, this will completely change the economy
---
F for your karma 
---
found them in the grafton vendor (not the station)
---
Massive farming location, pretty far away for most players. While it is a major plot point(like diamond city), many agree that white springs shouldn’t become a player hub.
---
Turrets will make short work of them 
---
Here is the location Circled since I got anxiety looking for it.  [https://imgur.com/a/bHSjGnR](https://imgur.com/a/bHSjGnR)
---
I found one on the ground, and another with the raider vendor
---
Ok.  I'll ask.  What is special about Jan 5th and what does it have to do with beef and cabbage?
---
Now you guys did it.  You killed the Scorchbeast Queen so many times the DefCon went down, deactivating the silos.
---
Now how are we supposed to nuke that town in China to escape the simulation?
---
Same for me, I think they been disabled on purpose. :(
---
My spine hurts because I know exactly how this feels with calibrated shock mods......
---
Why must I be on PlayStation T_T
---
Jess said this was not an intended thing and they are trying to figure out what is going on. Also there was no special in game event setup. It was a photo shoot for the Fallout twitter it had nothing to do with the nukes or in game events.
---
all day today so far
---
I need more tips like this. So much idk about this game 
---
Why the downvotes?
---
That's correct, at the moment the only +1 star that can be added are anti scorch receivers (that are pretty bad actually for everything else, and not to be confused with the better prime receivers) and the sacrificial blade mod for machetes (best upgrade for that weapon, found in shops)
---
What turrets are you using. Mine struggle with bees....
---
I mean, you can try I guess :)
---
Hey my gamertag is 'Dax Tucker'. How many caps are you looking to trade it for?
---
I have had times where i have spawnes in fresh from a day off of fo76 and there has been 3 attacking scorched. I quickly bailed on that, as soon as they spotted me. Bugs me that even stock asset buildings in the game, do not stop their attacks! Thanks for giving me the best answer on here, about commendations! 
---
Seems like they added caps to things like mailboxes and trash cans when they nerfed the caps stash boxes. I started earning more caps after they did that then before. And I found a cap stash today, a whole 14!
---
There are lonely nukes out there just begging to be launched.  #freethenukes.
---
TM-2 substation, just north of Watoga.
---
Best quest is Mystery then the Rose quest.
---
Yeah it's certainly not your PC. It's an in game glitch.
---
They haven't fixed any duping... The same method has been used since the start.
---
Ooops, I apologize. Definitely meant for someone else lol.
---
Never knew this, pretty cool!
---
I trade for it actually when I was still below level 50
---
I  just assumed for realism, since real life does have sub-stations
---
Because if the game doesn’t crash and works as one would expect it captivates and is really fun. It’s like a bad relationship when it’s good it’s great when it’s bad it’s suicidal....
---
   
---
The saddest thing I saw is the story of the man who went to look for his dog, which was stolen by looters. When I went to the location, I found the man next to his dead dog in a cage 
---
i like it! 
---
It only affects the condition of the items you drop from mobs. With a high luck you often get weapons and armor over 100% repair - pretty useless outside increasing their vendor value.
---
(pretty useless for me, I scrap them all anyway, for SCIENCE!)
---
Same! I just want a lil buddy!
---
Thank you
---
My favourite thing at the moment, is getting my controls disabled for 5 seconds, then get kicked after about 20 of them. I know then to gather my stuff, with the impending disconnection. Good Ol' bethesda. It does need sorting big time.
---
My main gun is a TSE prime handmade but my favorite gun is a quad explosive double barrel it's so much fun
---
2nd floors can attach to each other past walls on the first floor. If you want believability, you'll need a foundation for support struts. If you're okay with wacky, then have a 4x4 base with a door and a staircase, and a huge second floor. 😂😂😂
---
there isn't, i'm assuming he means 50 which is a "soft" cap
---
I’m on PS4. And it is fun! I flight with my girlfriend for like an hour. But it was fun because we weren’t being try-hards and we could give caps/junk back. It would not have been fun if she or I one shot, took caps, stole junk and then either left or kept killing.
---
You got it. Playing games is what I do for fun. I work a typical 8-5 job, come home and play games till 11 or 12am. Weekends I'll put in 10+ hours. I don't feel like I rushed through this game, that's just my play style I guess?
---
How much can you do? 3000? 
---
The other day I noticed a group of 3 new players, all under level 5, near the vault.  So I fast traveled near by and spent the next 30 minutes collecting resources. Then I found the group and gave them ammo, weapons,  and 130 healing salve.
---
I think so, I’ve finished “Belly of the beast” which I think is their last mission? It’s okay, I’m in no rush to get it. Thank you for thinking of offering it up =D!
---
Homemade rifle
---
Np my man.
---
I read the note about the man looking for the dog. What location is the dog at?
---
Believe it or not, there's a bug that if you are attacked in pacifist mode by someone with the mysterious stranger, you can be one shot, as obnoxious as it sounds. 
---
Always, ALWAYS carry some steel scrap with you.
---
Muscle memory can be pretty nasty in this game
---
Looks like playing as a garbage monster is gonna have its upsides.
---
I've tried several times to make it work. The wanted player can't defend themselves, so it just sucks.
---
And you read everything I’ve ever posted on all forums, Facebook groups in social setting.... good on you detective..
---
Yeah it's a feature
---
Brb gonna move next to a substation so I can use its power
---
Oh... wait
---
Anyone of them.
---
Nah, im good. I dont put the time i have into this game for them to determine it was all for nothing.
---
Two-Shot Explosive Combat shotgun is by far my favorite.  With the shotgunner, bloody mess, and demolition perks, it has a printed damage value of \~1200.  Anything short of a deathclaw, mirelurk queen, scorchbeast, ect. just becomes a pile of chunks.  Only downside is that if any of the pellets hit too close to me, I'm totally dead and will need to repair my power armor.
---
Right they have not released the sales numbers
---
We are in the same boat
---
The freak show 
---
Glow2:wave3: selling hunting rifles 50 caps ea
---
"What you pursue will be yours... But you will lose something dear. Your lucky color is.... Blue?"
---
That really sucks. I remember spending roughly 8 hours to finally get my first one by server hopping. 
---
If you're on xbox hit me up in PM and I'll give you mine. I haven't really been playing the game recently so I don't really have a need for it.
---
I'm the same haha
---
Greg and Resin?
---
I was in the Whitespring bar last night and met several people from the server there. 
---
This game needs challenging content very badly. It has always been fun to slowly make your character stronger, but once you reach a point where you realize no enemy can fight back or pose a threat, that fun disappears. There is no reason to make yourself stronger when everything is already trivially easy. I don't even use legendary weapons, and my build isn't fully maximized yet (level 63). This has nothing to do with player skill, I am a pleb.
---
I know many people like to be unkillable gods in Bethesda games, more power to you, but for the people that want to feel some resistance that makes the power grind necessary and meaningful, I hope they implement something difficult, or give us "hard mode" servers, or create private servers and let people mod.
---
Every time I see anything from bethesda's tech support, I have a hard time believing they've ever seen a videogame in person or used a computer outside of work.
---
Didn't even realize it. There's cuts of meat everywhere there. 
---
Lol, let’s not account for a change in year.
---
While you sort this out bethesda check what happens when daylight savings starts and ends 
---
:D I'd like that. If it's a building with a garage tor balkony just step in and make yourself a home &lt;3 Already love this place. Can't thank you enough.
---
Well, we actually do. Substations transition the power from the high voltage lines overhead to the lower voltage lines underground, which then come to our homes for use. So in a way, we all live next to a substation
---
Me and a buddy are roleplaying Arthur Morgan and John from red dead, and me XXSK8ERFTPXX
---
just screeching "JUST FIX THE GAME ALREADY" isn't very productive. providing video of said incident (and/or the steps to reproduce the issue if you can) would be much more help to bethesda.
---
It’s like the giant crab from family guy.
---
I would have like the rose quest line if rose wasn't completely insufferable.
---
An increase would be fine, but the ones who are saying people will still complain are right. Even if it was a 2000 limit folks are gonna say its not enough. 
---
There’s another vendor in Grafton that’s not in the train station?
---
This is beyond messed up.
---
As a trader I tried Whitesprings and got almost no business at all. Everyone there has their nose to the grindstone. They all have an agenda and they don't want to take the time to participate in my store. I stayed there for a couple of days with no luck. Then I moved near Morgantown and BOOM! Tons of business. 
---
\&gt;thatsthejoke.jpg
---
I mean I'm not saying I'm the only one, and I have said in that response that I liked some of the aspects of it, being able to play co-op against large end game bosses and events etc. I just sometimes want to be able to play alone, and although I'm not saying it's every time I log in but I've only had the game since Christmas and I've been attacked more times than that, maybe 5. 
---
As for just not playing it, yeah i get that but why shouldn't I be able to play the latest game? With elder scrolls it's fine, I just haven't played ESO all that much, but that's a separate game. Why should I have to wait another 3 years just so I can play a single player mode? I don't have an issue with the new server based online play, I just want to be able to create a private server or just have a server that I don't have to worry about setting up my camp if it's gonna get torn apart. 
---
But aside from that twice I've had to leave a game because it's been entirely inhabited by much higher levels than me and therefore almost all enemies seem to be levelled and impossible for me to kill. 
---
It kinda seems like you copied certain parts of what I've said to have a go, all I was saying is my opinion. 
---
The ghost of "feed the people" still hunts my dreams.
---
What does player vending mean in game?
---
Have you read the plans?
---
[deleted]
---
They should add an "inter-dimensional" area where people from any/every server can meet up to buy, sell, and otherwise interact. 
---
My suggestion would be the mezzanine area in Top of the World. We could have a quest line to clear it out and establish the vendor area. After completing the quest, it would become an auction house, night club, or whatever. 
---
Sadly it really doesn't just boil down to your perks and guns.  It's currently broken due to level scaling.
---
I get it now. Was a derp moment for me. lol.
---
But there was no NPC to stand there and explain what happened. how could you know for sure?
---
no NPCs does not mean no story people. pay attention to your surroundings!
---
Please don’t downvote me, but what are these substations? 
---
Good times, you gotta love people like that.
---
yeah, its easy to overlook, but when you get plans, you have to go into the "Notes" section of your inventory and actually use them.
---
^^^Nooooooo
---
You revealed the secret. Now my camp near WS will be constantly built upon.
---
I don’t.  What’s the point of scavenging if you can just make rare materials out of common ones.
---
It’s post apocalypse, industry is gone, infrastructure is gone.  It’s silly enough we can craft fusion generators.
---
There's been posts about two locations with two resource nodes. I managed to find one in the Ash Heap with lead and junk, it's not a very scenic location too me, so I never built there. My requirements are Savage Divide or east, and I absolutely have to build on water, so I've been walking the waterways looking for resource locations. That's the most enjoyable times in the game for me, the world is beautiful. 
---
Ya dyer chemical is the best to farm robobrains. At least 4-5 spawn. I remember when they used to drop fusion cores :(
---
Yarp?
---
I got to level 70 with 1 Luck. Then the patch with respec hit. Now I have 5 Luck. I've noticed more and more legendaries dropping (and spawning also, damn you level 52 major gutsy.) maxing out luck would kill my build, but I'm working on a new character with max luck for science. 
---
Probably Grognak axe does not have all the correct tags an actual weapon should have to correctly interact with perks, most likely added late or early in the game coding and since then forgotten.
---
Do they change into something else ever? I'm at 60 and mine is a crafting hub with adhesive farm and purifier array.
---
Is there anywhere to report bugs officially, like a log? I experience this one often on PC.    
---
Here's what I've found:
---
* Killing the targeted enemy stops it
---
* Running out of ammo and initiating the reload animation stops it
---
* Unequiping/putting away the weapon stops it
---
I just have away a PA frame with what I had of the t-45 armor set. 
---
Yeah, but it is only a chance thing.
---
Your pee is gonna glow for months. 
---
Last night the militia vendo-bot had a machete "sacrificial blade" mod for sale. It adds the bleed/poison/dmg effect from FO4 and adds a star to the machete, so presumably slapping it on a 3 star machete would make it 4 star...
---
Ah gotcha. I thought you just automatically unlocked them when you picked up the plans. I knew I was being dumb. 😂
---
That's Poseidon Power Plant, not Watoga's.
---
Same with Billing's Homestead. There's a power box on the wall of the house near the bench.
---
8 bucks for a tux, yeah, so much more "reasonable".
---
The shills on here really are something "special". 
---
And off to do my first power up. 
---
I’ve run across this repeatedly st the BoS vendor in watoga I think.
---
Perhaps Grafton too but definitely watoga.
---
Whatever happened to games that would reward you for reaching "unobtainable" areas and exploring places like this?! I've been to many places around the map that would be great to find some random loot, even if it was simply a one time grab with like 15 screws or something equally lame, I really enjoy this game but in this kind of instance, just a little SOMETHING would make me smile a little
---
So solo rifle just as is? Or trying to be sneaky as well?
---
Yes it’s because they don’t have the plans, it’s extremely stupid because you’ve made them something and they can’t use it however they can scrap it or wait until they get the plans
---
She’s a bit too Manic Pixie ~~Dream~~ Psycho Girl for my tastes.
---
Yeah, I like to think it's that simple! Knowing Beth it's probably just a mish-mash of functions all over the place all joined together with sticky-tape and chewing-gum though.
---
My new way of avoiding mistakes in my code is to have a big piece of paper pinned to my cubicle that just says **"WWBD?"** and then I do the opposite. Working so far.
---
I just set my camp as close to the middle of the map as I could to save on caps when travelling, now I need to see if there is a substation close by
---
Nice, just follow the instructions in my post and claim your item
---
It is but it seems like the best reason as to why even FO4 had it, a good way to trial it for say an online version?. 76 is after all their idea of FO4 online but expanded into its own title. It would allow them to fullfill the mod practice normal to their games.
---
While making sure it does not effect the atom store. In fact it would see more atom purchases as the creation club would most likely use them.
---
This is just my thoughts but still not sure how else the mods will be allowed in. Especially as they can't just have what happened with FO4 where modders created free versions of their creation club paid mods.
---
Imagine them doing that with say the atom store stuff hmm lol.
---
Oh, ok.  
---
I've only gotten them at random and my first char has one I locked in with Starched Genes. I can't remember which one it is.
---
You would assume that you auto read them but Bethesda wants to annoy us by making us press read lol
---
I personally being a level q6 right now feel greatful for it. Shows me that theres good people out there and makes me not want to quit. Although I do feel slightly guilty for accepting the free stuff, I know they mean good by it.
---
Exactly. After one of their patches in early December that started happening. You can build it for them or move it for them that session since you built it. But after that, its a paperweight until they learn the plans themselves. Kinda sucks.... Makes it hard to set up new players. :/
---
no 
---
You sound like you will enjoy the game, just be prepared for a lot of bugs, and I mean a LOT. Most of them are harmless but some of them require you to restart the game/find a new server which loses your progress on the previous server (for example workshop ownership).
---
Just a genuine question, why people prefer to upload to sites with bandwitch limits?  
---
Maybe first 100 people can see it, but after that nobody else.  
---
Usually people use reddits own image system and type text entry to comment. Like this thread title is quite explained good enough for that. 
---
It's a big other people would be able to see them, had to help my friend with an invisible mongrel and I had a 3* assaultron attack me last night kill me and when I went back to kill it he was invisible and just kept wrecking me. Wasn't using the cloaking tech but was just not there. 
---
I'm new to the game lvl 10 and I've only seen 1 so far lol 
---
i did this with Explosives, mini nukes weigh, 0.6, and missiles 0.2 :D now im a running gunning explosion!
---
Need some way to make caps for us casuals that can't server hop as fast... personally I can't spend most of my game time trying to get to the 7 different vendors to sell things to
---
No that is Sacrificial Blade, which is a mod for the Machete.
---
Yup.  If you do this to a ripper or a Mr. Handy blade the damage goes from like 7-10 to @40.  Makes the chain weapons not useless.
---
They nerfed the fuck out of Angler adhesive. Pre-Dec 11 patch I'd get 5-6. Every time.
---
Now they rarely drop 3.
---
My most recent one: "Build a Bunker"
---
It's a work in progress, but I [think I did okay.](https://imgur.com/gallery/WmCurX0)
---
Oh okay then I must have been wrong, I’m sorry man, I’ve seen it on YouTube that’s why I thought it is in there I haven’t read the terminal completely 
---
WELCOME TO THE WASTELAND! But yeah... it hurts that they are so rare now
---
I just drop fully modded out 200% repaired level 1 items for them.
---
No point giving them something game breaking 
---
I keep fortune finder on while I'm exploring and pleasantly stumble into them quite often.  There is at least one next to my camp that I always grab with cap collector when I log in.  I also know a route or two that net me some extra caps if I feel like running it.  There is also an unmarked location that always has two stashes side by side.  Just keep fortune finder equipped and you'll be surprised where the stashes pop up.  Happy hunting!
---
I’m a douchebag for making a factual comment in which I didn’t insult anyone?
---
Ok, man.
---
Because server hopping to find this lever action rifle plan is making me believe it does not exist...
---
.....Players can be vendors
---
I think that is part of an event. I forget what it is called, but the goal is to shoot down the vertibot before it flys off. apparently it flew close enough to you that you didnt join the event or something it seems.
---
I'm sorry my dude but I am growing weary of using the junk node near top of the word right by the vendor. Although I always come back...damn you whitesprings
---
I see. Sounds interesting
---
actually isn't there a bank in Morgantown? If so we could just open that fucker up and use it 
---
That’s all I can think of. Just checked it myself and it’s definitely still sellable. 
---
Well well we'll. That's good to know.
---
The fact that this happens at all is such a massive oversight. Like, wtf did nobody even think this system through? This one isn't new to me but I learn new ways this game can make your time and effort evaporate almost everyday.
---
Fortune finder is the audio for cap stashes right? Yeah personally I have my base in the whisperings area because I found an amazing base location&lt;3
---
I've saved every Nuka and Quantum I have found or purchased.
---
Once I hit lvl 53 and have all three ranks of SD, I'll be slinging nuka grenades like it's 2077.
---
Except for a quad explosive db 😉
---
I don't take to criticizing 76 much, but one thing that does irk me is how so many settlement objects from Fallout 4 are missing. 76 should have everything 4 had (excluding the obvious settler-based objects), and then some.
---
Super easy and cheap to build gennies, also there are MUCH better places to build
---
That was the most frustrating thing I think, launching a nuke on a server that had been stable for hours get into the zone and it disconnects between 1 and 15 minuets later. It started to not be worth the ammo cost of launching then getting nothing in return. It was a gamble every time, will I get enough scrap and goods to justify the ammo cost. 
---
They’re trying to appeal to the fortnite crowd by going full soyboy in the atom store. No different than when games went all cartoonish for awhile (ruined diablo 3) after wow was successful.
---
Well you got a point there - I sneak a lot and try to pick of enemies from afar. 
---
Does the south get a giant spider robot?
---
I’m pretty sure they won using a giant spider robot, I saw it in a documentary once
---
Hold PS button, press square. It's an accessibility feature built into PS4. It zooms in and helps the contrast quite a bit.
---
And the sacrificial blade mod you can find lying around adds a star to machetes. I actually use one on my xbox melee guy for the novelty of a 4 star weapon (plus vampire is god-tier on medium-very fast weapons)!
---
Wow. This was quite the thrill ride to read. Thank you
---
I'm wondering if it will be stations in the new vaults you can claim a vending machine and it will sell things for you 
---
I have the same problem but with magazines. Haven't found a single one but my friend has found like 10.
---
I still play it, but I am quickly running out of things to do so I don't know how much longer I will be playing it for. I know for sure that when the next Borderlands game comes out, I will drop this one.
---
Yeah, it’s a responder vendor in the centre of grafton
---
Rose?  That you?
---
yeah, it feels pretty odd, have seen something like it when i fast travel to my camp and there is a SB waiting for me there, you start taking DMG at once, but it will take a few seconds before the actual SB is visible / rendered :/
---
Bait shop's closed until January 5th.
---
I wonder how that quest plays out if you have Wasteland Whisperer equipped?
---
I must be doing somethinh wrong cause all i get from ticks is antiseptic 
---
The people still defending Bethesda are usually people who have been spoon-fed undercooked garbage for so long, 76 feels normal.
---
You can like the game, but defending its shortcomings instead of criticizing them and holding the developer/publisher accountable is not good for the industry.
---
it doesnt work like a fallout game tho
---
I fixed my disconnects but not logging on. Can’t disconnect a game that isn’t running !
---
Not to mention, when you give in to their harassment and want to do a 1v1. They brough 3 other friends, who just want your junk, even your cork and bones! 
---
There's a lot of /r/thathappened material on this sub.
---
Don't throw all of us under the bus. Everyone has their colloquialisms...
---
Scorched receivers from the fire breathers vendor in the Charleston Fire Station also add a star to guns, I had a 4 star bloodied, exploding, reload speed radium rifle.
---
Man. Thanks for the heads up. My grognak was at 1% the other day and I thought “that’s odd”. Was already considering switching that perk out. All the more reason to get a super sledge I guess.
---
Yah no one can launch a nuke a theory is that New Years screwed it up
---
I has the perk to calm down animals, that quest went differently for me :)
---
Maybe a good "compromise" would be that after you learn all the mods for a weapon you learn the plans for the weapon itself.
---
It'd also help us know when there aren't any more mods to learn.
---
I dunno, i was just throwimg an hypothesis. But its not secret some vendors have more of one stuff. For example the whitespring station vendor is specialized on meds. I guess prizes may derive as well because of this.
---
Block them, they then can't see you..then move camp.
---
I have about 15 hours on it, when does it get to anything other than a giant scavenger hunt? I got so bored of just walking across the entire map for a tape
---
Did you.....remove the sun dried tomatoes?
---
It can't be done with non-PA/Hazmat at the moment.
---
Several have tested it, and there seems to be a hidden resistance in those armors which regular armour can never reach.
---
Hopefully it'll be the subject of a future fix.
---
However, bloodied builds in general are a problem in a nuke zone, because even with PA you will still take enough rads to whittle you down from 19% health. One shots just become easier and easier.
---
I still like mine though :P
---
You guys realize this kind of thing is not going to happen in a pay once MMO right?
---
I've already started preying on players several levels lower than me. i give them all a chance to just drop whatever i say i need in a bag and then keep it moving. a few do, most dont, and meet the Assassin's Pitchfork.
---
I'm only a lvl 32, I've taken a few lumps losing 4v1 and anyone can just hire a mercenary several levels above me and just beat me down. But this game is so boring just roaming around trying to launch nukes and fighting scorched. 
---
I wanna start a Raider faction. A clan dedicated to just taking whatever we want, raiding camps of BoS factions and just being a nuisance. Everyone's been super helpful since the launch of the game but there arent enough assholes. There are no bad guys.
---
How easy is it to move camp? And if I block them can they still see my camp even if they can’t see me? 
---
I have 1 point in strength and use the travelling pharmacy perk because I have a billion radaways, rad x’s and stimpaks of all sorts.  Use that perk if you can as in my experience, for my player, it saves the most carry weight (unless you’re wearintb arnour filled with lead I guess)
---
I've seen quite a few Super Dupers lately.  Guess it IS a feature, not a bug.
---
Best quest is the DMV quest where it's so realistic I forgot I was playing a game and started grabbing all the shit around my house while running for a work bench to scrap.
---
I played 10% of that time, there’s no missions to do
---
I haven't found a place where I *can't* place my C.A.M.P. except the usual terrains or spots where you just can't build at all. I've placed mine right in the middle of one and walled it off. It's a bit annoying though, coming back to it and having things spawning inside of it, or literally inside of things I've built and having them getting stuck.
---
Without power armor or hazmat in a nuke zone? Ummmm I think that there is no sweet spot and that you will keep dying of rasa man where a hazmat to control ur dads and just go super low cuz whenever you die it removes rads
---
Is it sleeping bags or dirty bed? Not sure I have ever noticed what they were exactly called?
---
Ok thanks.
---
They should make it an Atom shop thing.  Then we can choose to grind for it or buy it outright. 
---
It's your ass.
---
The first time someone (lvl 34) gave me (lvl 6) something was shortly after a game message  about pvp popped up.
---
Said person looked at his pipboy, pulled out his rifle and shot the ground up in front of me - scared as I was I ran away (I only learned much later he tried to point at a greasy paper bag that I missed to see) 
---
Seen all the first list...still can’t find lever rifle or handmade lol.
---
Think I’ve seen the guitar sword plan
---
I tell ya what, building your own in game brick and morter store is **infinitely** more enjoyable than trying to hijack an existing location. I don't want a grand exchange cause it removes sooooooo much gameplay from the trader. It makes trading a thoughtless act. There's no haggling, just looking for someone who listed their price lower. There's no salesmanship, you just throw your wares into the ether. There's no sense of enjoyment when you cut a good deal to help out a lower level player. There's no sense of accomplishment when you have the perfect item to fit someone's build. And there's no way to develop a relationship with your customers. It sucks the life out of trading IMO.
---
People who have a different opinion to you and have a longer attention span than a goldfish. Sorry it's not fortnite...
---
Fuck empath....I seriously hate it I barely team up and server hopping for mutations is so damn boring
---
I was thinking this too.  I don't know if the transition from world X to interdimensional mezzanine and back would be an issue though, you'd have to be active in one world but have a CAMP in another.  Unless you leave one world completely, which might be a good workaround.but could get annoying at times.
---
Some of those will have a cargo bot with them and drop nuke key cards. 
---
I roleplay as an end of times christian pastor so I am a pacifist too any and all players as they still have souls that belong to God I cannot attack them.Nor do I eat any unclean meat or steal or lie . 
---
10 days after it was released fo76 dropped 42% in price on Amazon. It was the beta and the time in those 10 days that reviewers blasted it with hate, and the bugs were game breaking for PC players. I don't regret getting it at release, but it's put me off preordering Bethesda games. 
---
I've seen MANY today on PS4.
---
Lvl 156 and just started with building, and i get kind of obsessed with farming guns, mats and plans
---
That’s brilliant! What are those walls? How do build ventilation?
---
It’s such a strange scenario for me, I can go to the PUBG Xbox sub and criticise that game without issue, no one blindly defends the game or developer, but if I criticise 76 I feel like I get jumped. I play both games, I paid for them both, I feel like I should be allowed an opinion.
---
Are you always over encumbered or almost maxed on inventory space? It's just a theory of mine, but in a lot of games, the weight of your inventory affects, thirst, stamina, hunger, etc.
---
They are in fallout 4 also. Not too hard to kill though.
---
Yet another reason we need a server list.
---
I did Poseidon ONCE. Even with a full team, it was the most tedious, *boring*, and lengthy quest ever. There is no reason that we should need to repair that much shit for *temporary* 100 power. I can't even think of what someone could build at a Workbench, let alone a CAMP, that'd need that much. Most Extractors only need 10 power, but there's only 5 Extractors max at the largest Workbench sites. 
---
Industrial Purifiers only require 10 as well. I feel like to hit the 100 limit you'd have to purposely be trying to. It's moot once you unlock Fusion Generator plans, anyway. Once I get one of those babies I'll never do a Power Plant again.
---
Take the first rank of each damage card, not 3 ranks of 1 card.  30% vs 20%.  Refractor is a waste so long as you dodge energy attacks, which are slow.  Sturdy Frame is usually not optimal for non PA builds, take 2 points in Strong Back instead (a full set of non PA is usually around 30lbs, saving you 15lbs of only armor).  With Lone Wanderer you can drop Action Boy/Girl, the stack is barely noticeable (around 1-2 seconds from 0 to max with with both).  I'd swap All Night Long for Ironclad.
---
I personally would max agility (for VATS AP, Evasive and sneakiness) and luck (for Criticals), but that's just my own style for rifles.  [An example](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=4a345ff&amp;d=c72ic4sv1ad0ak0al0a80pd0pk0pl0lt0l12a00ao0am2p02ar2lk2lv2l71pp2lu2sg1ej2an2pe0&amp;w=&amp;n=) of a sneaky rifle/pistol build with full mutations.
---
They have mostly fixed this glitch. You can have completely invisible enemies that you can’t interact with in any way, but they can still hit you. Depending on the mob and environment you can run away and fast travel. If not logging out is another option. If in a team, usually your team can still see the mob and help you out. 
---
One time when this happened to me I was solo running from an invisible robot in watoga and loaded into one of the buildings.  The invisible robot followed me in, but was no longer invisible. 
---
Two Shot explosive Gauss Rifle with a suppressor. All nine rifleman perks, demo expert, sneak, covert ops, mister sandman, bloody mess, adrenal reaction. That's over 5k not including what adrenal can add. Then there is nerd rage and chens. Believe me if I could only get far enough away to sneak attack the queen I would be happy. Almost a guarantee kill in pvp if I'm not seen too.
---
Excuse me what
---
Yeah we have been digging deep into how Weapon Artisan is making things super interesting with the chainsaw, ripper, and mr handy buzz saw on my thread from a few days ago.  Head over and check it out if you wanted some info you don't cover here.  Thanks for sharing with the community though!
---
On the other side it works to your advantage she. You get effects or mutations that lower special stats...imagine perk cards randomly not working or being auto unequipped every time you get a disease or take a Chem or get blackout drunk (so every 2 minutes)
---
What system are you on? Im pretty sure I have one spare plan for that.
---
I'm on PC &amp; I just leveled a 2nd character, and from 1-50 and I've seen maybe a dozen.
---
I'm curious though, each one gave me less  than 20 caps, what do you get when you have full perks/buffs?
---
After completion of "Mayor for a Day" I'm Watoga, you can loot the safe every server hop for 8 stimpacks
---
The luck perk, Pharma Farma, might help you out a little bit, it gives you a chance to get more healy goods. As for location, the Watoga Emergency Services is a good place to start, but it's also a very popular place to farm, so don't be too disappointed if you come out empty handed. Also, Events. Everything ranging from the beginning level ones to defending workstations (even if they're not yours) hand out healy goods like candy.
---
Hope this helps! Good luck!!

One of the terminals(I think the Overseer’s) has a mandate from Vault-Tech saying something along the lines of; we want everyone to get out there and explore, so all of Vault 76’s functions will cease 24 hours after Rec day, including the air filters.
---
Do the mayor for a day quest in watoga. Once you complete you’ll have access to a safe in the mayors office that has 8 stimpaks every single day,
---
If you get the chemist perk you can double the amount of chems you craft. With the ingredients for a stimpak you’ll make two, then with purified water you can make 8 diluted stimpaks
---
Yeah, I've been collecting cores for weeks with the expectation that the recharging feature will be fixed one day.  I have over 220 cores, so the max-rank Batteries Included drops that from 660 pounds to 66.  It's nice that they have it in Intelligence, cuz most of those perks are for crafting so I can swap it out for something else in the 3 slots and just be overencumbered when I'm crafting.
---
Yes the wanted system is a punishment. 
---
Until someone engages you "your rules" of pvp still hold. However as the punishment "their rules" are as if pvp is engaged. 
---
Do they have XBox and PC on sale too?
---
The problem is it plays like an MMO, with the constant grind for upgrades yet gives you none of the advantages of an MMO. It only implements the worst part of an MMO. 
---
Is the quantum grenade still bugged to have a tiny blast radius?
---
I was saving nuka-cola for grenades until I discovered that plasma grenades are so easy to collect.
---
They would need to change engines to avoid that but they seem either too lazy or reticent to adapt
---
They provide power to your base and they provide better power if you repair the reactor like posiden/monogah/thunder mountain 
---
meaning a wanted/bounty person deals full damage without other players attacking them first?
---
I'm not over encumbered but I am usually close to it. Next time I play I'll have to check that out. I'll be timing from full thirst to going into the red under various scenarios to see if I can narrow down the reason. All I know is right now I'm going through purified water like nobody's business. 
---
Thanks for the insight! Gives me something to look into. 
---
10 unpowered, 100 if the local Plant is powered.
---
Thank you for letting us know what was happening. We were very confused as I had just built the items, they moved their camp, and suddenly they were stuck. We never exited the session so it seems that storing the items might trigger the paperweight effect too?
---
They didn’t have an option to stay in the vault. All the ventilation systems are on auto shut down along with the door. If you don’t get out by a certain time the door closes and they would die of suffocation
---
GREAT review!!!!! I love what you said about PVP when some higher level player went after your lower level son. One guy kept killing and looting me over and over and finally I called my husband and made him get on our other system and save me. 
---
Ironically (maybe), you have to do the power plant missions 3 times to get the fusion generator. Yes, terribly long and annoying quest to be sure. And I manage to get lost every single time. 
---
They're not rare, the game just doesn't let us get at them.
---
I mean something like a mingun alone should have enough screws to last for a year.
---
This is an alt world- not the fallout universe. You’re meant to go to the atom store, buy a fruit hat, then go wander an unpopulated, namby pamby version of a wasteland until you find another human being that either sounds like a soyboy or a 12 year old.
---
Eventually you isolate yourself from the public and start building an elaborate camp on the fringe of the game world. Then you realize it: this isn’t an fps rpg, it’s a post apocalyptic interior design simulator.
---
“Ooooh la la the WAR I’m having with this floral arrangement. War never changes.” Eeeee ohhhh!
---
I was able to do this mission on ps4, but my buddy was unable to. I see they have an announcement from the 3rd of December on their support site. This is pretty embarrassing that they can’t fix this issue at all!
---
Personally I am having fun deep diving into different builds and finding new ways to make builds OP.  I am also enjoying the challenge of creating content that is catering to the questions I see popping up here most often to try and help out folks who may not have as much time to play as me.  The other way I am staying engaged is playing with friends, especially when they don't have as much time as me, it's always fun to take people through things and get to see their first time experience reactions :-)
---
It's not effective for vfast weapon, it only applies 1 time per swing (I was real excited for a 3* vampiric buzz blade..  it was disappointing)
---
If you're in need of disease cures, equip green thumb. Fast travel to the hotdog stand south of Sunshine Meadows and walk up the river collecting all the blood leaf and snaptail you need to your hearts content. For firecap, fast travel to overseers camp and start heading north towards the junk yard workshop and around gauley mine entrance.
---
Equip chemist to craft double chems and super duper for 30% double craft. After one run I tend to walk away with 40-50 disease cures for about 5 minutes work.
---
Greg in Grafton, hidden away in a building covered in Responders graffiti.
---
Resin the Raider, at the ski lodge next to Top of the World, in the building with the Bellhop.
---
Chad of Camden is another one I like, but since most them share caps you gotta pick favorites
---
Just have the person blue print their foundation piece with what you placed (their fusion core generator for instance) once they blueprint it they will be able to place the item locked on top of the foundation piece from my experience.  🤙🏾
---
10 power by default.
---
If someone figures out a way to exploit and share atomic shop items with other players (currently, you cannot share atomic shop items with anyone outside of your character), this will force Bethesda to patch the game ASAP because atomic shop is their secondary cash king.
---
I think this is what OP means.
---
Care to explain a bit more?
---
I’ll check them out
---
No they take full damage as punishment. 
---
I bought a few T51 armor pieces with Nuka cola paint job that someone unloaded in that vendor. Haven’t seen this paint job in the nuka store so assuming it was some temporary thing they ran. Either way, someone has those painted pieces before me, and now I have them. 
---
If your on Xbox just make sure you send a few group invites to some people so if you do get disconnected you can just go in the recent player tab and rejoin that server 
---
Hi duper.
---
Thank you, I agree that it is incredibly stupid. At least we know now and can try to work around it next time!
---
This shadow will cover my heart until we see more non loot lunch boxes.
---
I didn't assume those things. I have derived the behavior of the game via constant experimentation and then aligned my internal predictive model to the empirical data given by the results of those experiments.
---
Reverse Pickpocket. Requires 100 Stealth.
---
There are a lot of assets that would be great for our CAMPs.
---
I miss the Fallout 4 mods that let you build stuff like airplane pieces, the small trailer, and tall junk walls.
---
-2/10 I lulled 
---
The game gods are blessing you then. Cause I haven't lol
---
Yeah if you store something you yourself can't build. You can't place it till you have the BP for it. Yeah I had that problem, took me a month to get what I needed to re build my base
---
I haven't tried, but I suspect that Thunder Mountain power plant would be a good place. You might be able to get that medical supply building in the zone as well. Plus there's always tons of mobs wandering the swamp near Ellie's Bunker.
---
And you'll probably have spent a far larger portion of yours being a smarmy cunt to people on the internet for no discernible reason 
---
Well.....that would certainly suck
---
Ask Bill Cosby.
---
I played as an NPC companion a couple weeks ago. I was Nuka Cola Man and took random players on The Quest to Zap Thirst. They had to find me Nuka Cola, Nuka Cherry, and Nuka Quantum and then I gave them some of the extra plans and supplies I had. It was a fun way to clear out the stash box for sure.
---
Pc has a recent players on the social overlay btw
---
Ok, cause I have a solid build right now for a sneaky, non-automatic rifle build.
---

---
Right now, I interchange my intelligence perks between Gunsmith, and Weapon Artisan to get the most repair I can to make my weapon last longer. The build is designed for my custom made lever action rifle I have, if you have any questions, fill free to ask about it.
---
m79 can be gotten from raider vendors, I have gotten it 2-3 times before they fixed double dipping shotgun+demo perks with it.
---
Legitimate Y2K situation
---
Most diseases I just ignore if I get them. Only a few with effects like food or water loss are annoying
---
It’s not you can find the blueprints somewhere in game, but there is a bug that people have been using to trade atom shop power armor. 
---
I've seen a 4 star melee item
---
I wanted to use it, but for some reason image upload was greyed out and blocked when I created the post. I assumed its temporarily offline for reasons, so I just took a different host.
---
Wait, so Weapons Artisan gives extra durability to melee weapons? I have it at rank 3 and when I repair them, I don't get the second bar, only with rifles and such.
---
I feel like one of the other Fallouts had a feature where you could turn the notes into plain text that looked like the rest of the pip boy UI. It was a good accessibility feature and probably helped for translation too. 
---
I would also like to have subtitiles on the radio drama holotapes. *Radio drama plays*, really? ☹️
---
I agree here. OP’s idea is great, but I think it would function best as an addition to Scrapper since it’s so “meh” at best, right now.
---
I use discord to text chat with people. I know it's 3rd party and not in the game but it works.
---
Eh I only had it 3 times in my 101+ hours in the game. But yeah I mostly just crash
---
Expired?
---
Isn't that already the point of intelligence? Each point increases you chance to learn a mod from scrapping. Curious if anyone had tested it with high intelligence through buffs (unyielding armor, mentats, etc).
---
PS4? Let me help you out ...
---
You cant really prevent that from happening again some people are going to be dicks and if that happens again might as well go to a different server. My suggestion is to place a camp were people wont go around that area that often. You can also get a perk card for higher defenses but most higher levels can destroy your turrets. As for materials to repair your camp is easy when you scrap weapons or any junk you have.
---
Currently atomic shop items cannot be used by anyone who didnt purchase them. If an exploit was found that allowed them to be shared amongst players bethesda would be more inclined to patch the game asap because its their income thats taking a hit. Not really serious about it just a bit of a joke
---
Here is a trading/selling discord
---
Hence why I love capping the ammo workshop, or pretty much anywhere I can get lead. Ammosmith + super duper perks and you’re up to your eyeballs in ammo of your choice!
---
So why is that a thing though? How is that obvious in any way to what your supposed to do to play this game? Wouldn't it be a better mechanic to do one of my above suggestions? 
---
I have Tesla plans.
---
&gt;While solo i run around the map and get people to tag cargobots so they can sell/trade me their nuke cards for stims or supplies
---
On xbox, so the message feature is nice, global chat box would be better though.  They like to chat and those guys are usually not too awkward. At last count If I interacted with you directly, I will have no intentions of bothering/nuking you. The bait is the lvl4-lvl38? with in flatwoods, and even then it depends on someone els, im just the button pusher.
---
 If you want the full experience, be a girl and play ~~xbox~~ any videogame for some amount of time, the weirdos migrate to you and send some cringe worthy messages, and insult you for calling them out on it.  Ask any of your female gamers for input on this if you don't believe it. 
---
As for the cost of rebuilding, with the contractor perk, it's manageable. 
---
Without even having the pharmacy or canned food perks if you have max luck you just generally find more everything 
---
You kinda did break your life down a tad though. You used your apprenticeship as a metric to measure it by. Anyone can look at your profile and read the last dozen or so comments you've made and they'll see you're starting shit and being a smartass in almost every single one. So no, I don't believe you're being sincere. Sorry. 
---
It’s disabled for the time being, though i think charlie is working fine
---
Always scrap junk for the base resources.
---
Scrap all normal weapons and armour.  (Except ones you’re going to use then and there).
---
Bulk all junk resources when able to save stash space.
---
Figure out which resources you use the most of the. Save more of those.  (eg I have so many springs and gears I will never use because I don’t use power armour...but I can’t bring myself to part with them just in case...don’t do this lol).
---
Get ammosmith (if not melee only), white knight (if using normal armour), super duper (get this regardless), gunsmith (if not melee only).  Really get all crafting perks and have enough points intelligence, perception and agility ( and luck for super duper) to use the right perk loadout for crafting...you can unequip them for more useful perks when not crafting.
---
Don’t repair non legendary armour, just craft new stuff or wear what you pick up.
---
Get starched genes and class freak when you can and try and get a few good mutations (marsupial, speed demon and healing factor are very useful and don’t have much downside at all).
---
Don’t walk around with lockpicking and hacker equipped, swap them in and out as needed (unless you don’t have a better perk to use).
---
Pick up every fan, type writer, hot plate, you see for scrapping.
---
Get nutfruit, Tatos, and corn and plant it at your camp and get some water purifiers (vegetable starch makes adhesive).
---
Pick a play style early and commit to it, build your perk and special for it.  My two shot crossbow is still more effective than any other legendary I have come across personally because of my perk loadout.
---
Enjoy the game.  If you’re not enjoying what you’re doing, change what you’re doing.  If you still don’t enjoy it it’s probably not what you are looking for
---
I agree, although purified water has it's uses in crafting I can't see how it cannot be substituted for boiling water? Surely if anything the use of purified should give increased benefits to whatever you cook? 
---
I'm playing Fallout 76 just as I played Fallout 4. By myself and always messing up my perks so my character becomes some kind of average every build fighter. I don't have any friends playing the game and I rarely meet others while scavaging every single lootable item
---
When your core is about to run out. Just server hop while in power armor. It resets your fusion core to 100%.
---
Bethesda just tweeted about it it’s broke 
---
There’s an active crusade against anybody who might dare say that dupers are not the end all, be all of all the issues with this game.
---
Heard the same when the WC glitch was around and, we’ll, we are all still experiencing bad server connectivity issues (even worse this week due to the increase in players because of Xmas).
---
Bottom line is, this game has many problems (some game breaking) and there is a sizeable amount of people on this subreddit blaming everyone but Bethesda.
---
I hated when they took the moral meter out of games and made in a lot of them all paths were it seemed too me different shades of evil.So I impose the rules on myself,i believe a healthy moral compass should be on the forefront of ones mind in play,or in real life.
---
I think they should just make them shareable anyway, they would make MORE money from people buying them to sell to other players for caps than players only purchasing what they'll use
---
Yes, I love staring at my surroundings for hours imagining what happened; instead of doing Fallout stuff. ^^/s
---
Big supporter of the game, I love everything it could be. But for the love of god if I spend another hour clearing a workshop and making it nice only to disconnect while defending it I'm just going to quit for good.
---
I was taking a phone call while afk'ed and was messing around with the atomic shop menu and noticed that the video playing in the background has magazine racks with magazines, bobblehead stands with bobbleheads, as well as a bunch of other stuff that's actually being sold in the shop. I know some of it might be an imaginary thing but this to me seems to imply that they're coming. 
---
The shops in whitesprings have cases with random stuff in them that you can't loot. That would be another way to do it.
---
radworms, if your going against scorched, is an extra 20% damage or so. 
---
Fly satter
---
Just adding it was all I did back then. It has since been added automatically so this post likely isn't relevant. 
---
Even with a 1070 the game doesn't run as well as I'd like so who knows.
---
First time I was one was in far harbor in Fo4. It's name and health showed up from really far back so I knew what to expect.
---
That's exactly my point. I feel like should should just be a thing in the game anyway. Water is water, right?
---
Medics combat rifle? Explosive shots 
---
Now, I'm not saying I'd fuck a Wendigo, I'm just saying...y'know...when in Rome...fuck a Wendigo.
---
The “fsht fsht fsht” where it keep popping in and out from the right side of your screen? Congratulations, someone on your server is duping. Pull up your map and look for two players on top of each other and not moving.
---
Lol yeah, it takes too long to trade and people lose interest when it looks like nothing is Happening.
---
Microphones help a bit but that requires having j the mic on area and on PS4 that means everyone gets to hear me my wife and I talk, well she talks and I nod
---
I built my camp under one of the train bridges heading into Harper’s Ferry, and plopped down four industrial water purifiers and four windmills up on the bridge. I even named it the Max Apogee Water Treatment Plant. No resource nodes, but it’s highly defensible and an easy way to log in, get water, and sell for caps.
---
Anyone else notice all notes are slightly too far left? Like letters get cut off and you have to infer.
---
Blocking them stops them from seeing you on the map. Best option to not lose your whole camp is to log out when they start attacking. 
---
If they haven’t fixed it there is a glitch that lets you store your broken item and then place it again as a magically fixed item. 
---
Isn’t my job mate, it’s Bethesda QA teams job. Besides I gave no idea how or why it keeps happening perhaps what others have said server instability. Some days no issue others it’s a mess
---
this, takes 10 mins to farm 24-36 stimpacks, good for a good play session.
---
they all seem to be bugged, [missile holotape shows this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/520068450597601314/529706262942973952/ScreenShot7.png)
---
So you’re going to go around healing the monsters of the wasteland?
---
That’s downright decent of you Homer!
---
Well, I suspected that it was THEIR level. Because obviously, Flatwoods vendor is like level 5. And Whitesprings is like level 40. But that's a HUGE price jump from 29 to 79. I'll keep digging.
---
I just tried Charlie since its close to my base and nothing.
---
100% agree. Have my upvote before the “duping is the reason why this game isn’t amazing” squad comes through.
---
It would be helpful even though I do use most of mine to dilute my Meds. 
---
"player vending" sounds like an awesome new feature
---
I want to have a one night stand with this reply.
---
It’s not nice. But sometimes it feels really satisfying to not be good.
---
But that would make it pay to win
---
So, does Bravo work?
---
The fatman is called the daisycutter, if it's the weightless MIRV.
---
There aren't that many good quest reward weapons tbh. Your best bet is horde events or uranium fever, as both end up in you getting to kill some high level legendary enemies. Aside from that you can just buy one from players
---
The way the game works you would need to add a separate recipe using purified water. So basically double all the water based recipes. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I really like the idea of persisting player-built structures, but without having the ability to select specific servers a big issues arises.
---
If you log into a different server right after disconnecting what happens?
---
Do you lose your camp everytime you like with workshops? If so, people would have little incentive to build big camps since they'll lose all of it when they log off.
---
Or would it instead create a copy of it on the new server? If so, couldn't that be easily abused to duplicate bases and resources? 
---
Understandable
---
Store items are only cosmetic, so not really
---
Known issue.
---
Officially, they're saying it's a bug.  People started noticing this happening last night.  My guess?  They intentionally disabled nuke sites for their Whitesprings New Years get-together and ran into problems re-enabling them.
---
It has me over the moon missy. :D
---
I love roleplaying as a npc trader this sounds like a great qol addition.
---
I'm on PC, would that still work do I get mods from your crafted guns? 
---
I agree. But these posts are getting repetitive. 
---
I don't want this personally.  The "hardmode raid" mindset has creeped into every game now a days.  I like my jrpg scaling :P I go from poopy to godlike.  That said, maybe hardcore servers or hardcore modes with permadeath would be okay, so I could opt out lol
---
I hope you took the blocks, got to get that lead!
---
Oh that makes sense, I was wondering the point of them.
---
But couldn't the current recipes just say Boiled/Purified water
---
I think uranium fever has a garunteed legendary spawn. Also, I like Watoga as if you're lucky you can find a lot of legendary enemies (although it isn't garunteed).
---
Not sure I understand what you mean.
---
Im no expert. Im not even finished building it. 
---
Bloody Deathclaw gauntlet is max dmg for fists i think
---
I like heavy combat armor. Right  now im using a mix of what ive got so far. 2 metal 1 leather 2 combat. Bloody super sledge

---
My strength is in the high 30's /low 40s drunk. Maybe unyielding is better for melee with all the strength bonuses. My luck and agility are only on the high 20s when at low health. 
---
First time I have seen this, thank you!
---
I don't know what you posted somewhere else. Maybe you are the one true herold. The thing is: You are not one of the few. We are many here and in other platforms trying to be constructive. Saying that you are one of the few is a) debatable, b) still doesn't make you any special. We all have disconnects, crashes right after launching a nuke, enemies not spawning loot. You are no more or less entitled that anyone else who spend 60 bucks on the game.
---
If they completely revamp or replace their game engine they could theoretically do anything. But currently no. 
---
"I'm going to show *My* best friend, Wendigo, to *Everyone* in town, *Wearing a clown suit.*"

"You're gonna be wearing a *clown suit?*"

"BAhahahaha, that's a good one, Wendigo!" 
---
I'm gonna launch so many nukes in February 2020
---
I'm talking about Arma 2 DayZ. My clan ran multiple servers and we offered the services I listed so it really isnt nonsense at all.
---
I dunno. It does does for me. Check my ski sword, white bar on main CND bar is there. But you have to exit weapons table or just go back, check some other weapon and go pack to your repaired weapon
---
I'll need to look into that! Thanks.
---
What happens when you dump-stat endurance: the thread
---
I have been having a little trouble with my melee exclusive build and scorch beasts. You have to shoot the beasts to get them to land and if you're soloing it's hard to shoot it enough.
---
The one SB I killed alone I found a Gatling laser nearby and had fusion cores on me for my PA. I would shoot it until it landed and the super Sledge the heck out of it. The sledges were the final kill so I could see and loot the corpse which was nice. Wasn't until later that I realized the Gatling laser ate all my fusion cores lol. 
---
Found a plasma Gatling which uses plasma cores instead so I'm going to use that now. I hope none of the later game PA uses plasma cores, I guess if it does I'll go back to the Gatling laser. 
---
Ferris Bueller you’re my hero 
---
I like seeing Player Vending mentioned again. 
---
Its not the items that give the advantage its the caps I could get from crafting and selling these items that would give the advantage.
---
If you hold in the power button on your controller the Window to shut off your Xbox pops up to the bottom left there see should be two prompts one for magnifier one for narrator. For the magnifier you can zoom in and out with the triggers
---
Well it's partially a survival game, it's not meant to be an action stroll in the park. There's going to be survival aspects and things that slow you down. And I wouldn't say it's not obvious it's what you need to do. You need disease cures so you look up the recipe if you have it, look up the components and you search for them. Eventually you find spots that yield more than others.
---
The game rewards experience and learning, and in regards to your suggestion, there's foods/meds that reduce disease chance, perks that reduce them as well (I think?) Everything you want is in the game, it's just not handed to you for free.
---
The plans were two separate plans one for the mask and one for the outfit. The mask was under headwear and the outfit under outfits. I made one set for my friend and now I can o my make the body. This has happened to me with several plans. Really frustrating as some are rare, expensive and hard to find. 
---
Nah i play games in my free time too so im not judging you, but yeah your gonna get bored playing the same game 7 hours a day 7 days a week, anyone would.  
---
Hopefully this year brings plentygul uodates with new content to the Game
---
Well player vending is soon to be a thing. 
---
I think full on factions will be a thing. I just don't think they'll be player created.
---
I really need a newer tv
---
Not buying this. 100 stimpacks is 100 pounds alone.
---
it would be nice. I've been siing here for over 10 minutes and have 200 dirty water. (i also have 900 wood)
---
 that is fallout stuff. exploring crumbling areas and finding out what happened before and after the bombs is part of the game.
---
Yeah scouting for camp spots is so much fun. Why do you stay east of the divide? There are some nice spots way west along the Ohio River and a decent lead/junk spot up in toxic valley. I have been staying in the forest because it's peaceful, I only have the budget for one turret which they're about worthless anyways and I don't want my camp getting a messed up by higher level enemies. I was posted up on the outskirts of whitesprings but scorchbeasts and other higher level mobs would find their way to me pretty frequently
---
I have a similiar build but more VATS focussed.
---
Strength - 1
---
Perception - 15
---
Endurance - 1
---
Charisma - 4 (lone wanderer)
---
Intelligence - 12 (I think)
---
Agility - 15
---
Luck - 12 (I think)
---
All rifle perks maxed out, bloody mess, tank killer, all ranged stealth perks maxed out.
---
All chameleon armour (all deep pocketed to make up for no strength).
---
I just use a two shot crossbow and one shot almost everything in stealth....and usually stay in stealth unless an enemy physically runs into me).
---
I have an anti armour dragon for scorch beasts if there are more than one (or a glowing one is up in my face).
---
It needs 5 each of violet and cobalt flux. If you aren't an obsessive hoarder you may not have this just laying around.
---
Corn
---
Np dude. I kept thinking that’s just me being bad luck but it got too ridiculous so I started suspecting and decided to change it up. Good luck to your Super sledge finding!
---
I find 25 to be the most common, but 15 does exist. 
---
Razor grain 
---
Sorry I couldn't see the entire skill tree and decided to make a different build than the narrow field this game wants me to play. 
---
or it could just be its because they are releasing the story as it goes and there are 8 zones not 4 and we are only 50% into the content as they pointed out 3 months ago and thats why we just got the first big boss in December
---
ALSO the br team and STW team are different teams they share assets to stream line downloads as br was build out of STW assets but they even have 2 boards for hiring and a showing of who is in each team and other then a few people who are artist they are all pretty much unique teams  
---
Top 5 I would 
---
Are you crafting healing salve?  I have 1 pt in luck and I'm swimming in stimpacks because I only use them when I'm getting my ass kicked.  I use food and bev between encounters, and healing salve is my go-to for those mid-encounter, hide-behind-a-pillar-and-heal-a-bit moments.
---
Are you talking about Hillfolk Hotdogs?  I have been farming them starting at Slocum Joes and heading south, but don’t get near the same # you are getting using the same perks. 
---
City of Heros was fun for that they had a entire bar people just hung out and RPed
---
Corn, mutifruit, and tatos so you can make vegetable starch which is adhesive.
---
That my point. The best sniper build means that you can't carry anything in a game that was meant to have you collect things. I'm so tired of playing Purse Simulator 76.
---
It’s New Years, the robots are off partying 
---
How much ? 
---
I think I have my current camp there. It's south of space station and east of the black bear lodge. I have a junk extractor on one edge and a lead extractor on the other edge of camp. You just need to plop your camp perfect between them in the center to be able to use both.
---
I know, that's what I'm saying.
---
If I never want to play an event again, it's a poorly designed event. It's why I've only come across ONE server where someone already did one. Nobody finds the Powering Up event fun. It's literally, "Run around the facility for 20 minutes clicking on shit trying to find all the broken consoles."
---
I’m working on this too. 
---
You evolve there *after* you have the PA version of the build working, have a shit ton of unyielding stuff in the stash, and some of it has 2-3 effects, and some of which is raider/robot/marine with natural radiation resistance.
---
The sweet spot is 19%-9%. A dilluted radaway takes you from 9 to 19. 
---
I’m doing 
---
STR 12 (9 weapon, 1x3 combat ancillary)
---
PER 15  (9 weapon, 2x3 combat ancillary)
---
END 1 
---
CHA 6 (4 Lomé wanderer, 1-2 tenderizer)
---
INT 5 (3 nerd rage, 2 power patcher / stabilized 2)
---
AGI 9 (5 adrenaline, 3 blocker, 1 gun fu)
---
LCK 8 (3 bloody mess, 2 Starched genes, 3 mysterious savior) 
---
Note: 
---
1. It doesn’t care if you’re using STR guns, PER guns or melee. 
---
2. It packs in all the meaningful damage perks. 
---
3. It assumes a “thin” mutation stack (marsupial, speed demon, adrenal reaction, chameleon and grounded) so you don’t need to control the downsides. 
---
4. It has safety nets:: power armor’s emergency protocols keeps you permanently at half damage before DR. Lone wanderer shaves 30% off. You can slide in Blocker 3 into your STR ancillary for another 45% from melee. Mysterious Savior revives you some of the times you die. 
---
To not-power-Armor, you need to manage Serendipity 3 into there, and depending on how your 2-3 star robot/trapper/marine  unyielding wardrobe is doing, you may need to add radiation resistance perk ranks too. 
---
Yeah that's the one, I've just been trying to far nuke zones without much luck, nothing special anyway so I'll try them events. Thanks.
---
Wow, I didn't know that, thank you so much!
---
Good. Meet me at the church.
---
2k
---
Tried one yesterday my buddy crafted. Yes, it is.
---
So, the Tower from Destiny?
---
So pissed right now. I just found three pieces of level 15 and the server crashed...
---
Ordinance Express changed my life. Now every day is Torgue Day!
---
Man, what is it with Reddit?  
---
Last time I pointed out that mods get prioritised over bulk I got downvoted.  
---
It’s a serious problem that needs to be addressed.
---
You are my hero thanks 
---
Unless they release more content we have to keep ourselves busy somehow.
---
After getting all the plans/guns/serums recipes we wanted, we were fine with the trading for nuke cards to see what other stuff the queen would drop. All this started with one dude making uncool remarks, and a joke about nuking his base. Some of our group took screenshots of the trifecta nuked bases that I have to ask for at some point.
---
He means if you are wanted you do slap damage (until someone engages with you), but other players can deal full damage without you,  the wanted player, engaging back. 
---
Why do you think there's a remote chance at a healthy economy when every player can harvest and stockpile whatever resource they want? 
---
I play as a stealth sniper with 1 strength.  I don’t have an issue.
---
My armour is all deep pocketed, I use travelling pharmacy as my 1 strength perk.
---
I don’t need more than weapon at a time because I have gunsmith 5 and weapon artisan 3.
---
I could pay 1600 caps, it uses .45 ammo ? 
---
Thirdly they need to fix any and all means of trade theft.  I'm so terrified of having my inventory wiped that before trading I will store everything of value including my suped up X01 armor, and all of my weapons. 
---
Gatling pladma cores weight 1lb each, bot 3 like regular core, no perk needed
---
I try to stay east so I can cut fast travel costs, use Vault 76 for free if I need to go to that side of the map, and my C.A.M.P if I need to go to the eastern side. I spend a lot of time selling junk and farming plastic and lead, so it's not feasible to build near Vault 76 although there are so many great areas there, I'll probably build around there again eventually. 
---
Different people on different days. Had that issue myself and seen it more than once lol....
---
Like bloody picking the right day is needed to get your message across...
---
So if you're wanted and don't want to die it's best to strike first? But then doesn't that push up your wanted bounty?
---
Extra income isn't too much of an advantage, ESO added something similar. But ESO does have more of an economy based on crafting, no such thing here yet. People already paid gold for styles others grinded drops for in-game, so it wasn't much different. Crafting is a very small percentage in this game so it would definitely cause an inflation
---
How does 1600 sound to you ? 
---
But yet nothing on how they plan to fix the nuke launching bug.
---
ign ?
---
Or they disabled it for that event and realized servers weren't crashing as much.
---
Yup. Start at the bottom of the deposit list. Twice the game put my ammo on the list, if I hadn't been watching I'd have lost over 600 5.56.
---
Thanks! I guess I need to put some points into agility. I don't wanna mess with mutations to much tbh tho
---
I totally don’t mean this in a disrespectful way, but how do you get to level ~35 and not realize to store items/junk?
---
You got anything you can throw on top?
---
No he really doesn't, none of us do, and you overestimate the bargaining power the average consumer has  (in the US definitely but in many other countries as well) they don't give a shit about you and downvoting me isn't going to change that... companies don't care what the customers think anymore, only what the shareholders want, anything they are doing to improve that now is purely out of good faith because we're not entitled to jack shit (You didn't buy the game, you essentially just bought a "license" to play the game, which is how almost all software is handled these days and which can be revoked at any time for almost any reason)
---
Bethesda already made their profit from this game, despite the reviews and the backlash it sold a lot of copies; get your head out of the clouds and stop thinking you're important or entitled because you're not and you nor anyone else has a "right" to anything regarding this game other than the right to play it, and that's arguable
---
Can't wait to see the game this time next year
---
My problem with that is:  
---
1. The tree was very inaccessible. There was no instruction on how to use it or what was going to happen. 
---
2. I've play the rest of the fallout games in survival mode and they were relatively easy to understand what I needed. Food and water were a part of what I needed to keep tabs on, but they didn't go down as quickly. In general, the demands of this game are like maintaining a four year old whale that needs to be a bubble child. 
---
JimmyRiddle01
---
Holy run on sentences. 
---
Epic is a for-profit company. Regardless of whether separate teams work on the different modes or not, far more updates are released for BR than STW and I daresay it makes them a lot more money. Keeping the game in early access for ease of updating to add cosmetics and new weapons/items/consumables increases their profit margin. If you honestly think it has absolutely nothing to do with money, I have no idea what to tell you other than to read up on capitalism. 
---
I like Melons because Melon juice has HP Regen. But I have at least one of every crop just to be able to make some recipes. 
---
Yes, little boom makes the quantum grenade worthless. But those nuke grenades are devastating. Definitely have killed myself a bunch with them.
---
Yeah that's the spot. It's insane how much you get, and if you need more, fast travel to the overseers camp and follow the river south for more snaptail/bloodleaf. Firecap is the harder one to find I feel, but even heading north from the camp gives a lot.
---
YES.
---
Please stop by for a rest (I’m my alt’s house - my main is built where you people will never bother or harm me).
---
But please SHUT THE DAMN DOOR. We’re you born in a barn?
---
 Not really :/ ah you know what let’s do 2k man 
---
Well, the pvp and wanted system are out of wack right now. If you are wanted and dont want to die, tough titty cacas you're S.O.L. you cant necessarily stike first since you'll do super littke damage. 
---
Does it work that way? I thought everyone's shop inventory were unique. 
---
Right now, mine is def the Handmade. Be a lot cooler if it was easier to obtain.
---
Great points - I will definately look into agility and luck more. Thanks
---
Ight come join me xxxjrobbxxx
---
Somehow got it on the second try
---
Nuka power armor paint isn’t an atom shop paint. You find it in game
---
This would just be another perk we have to remember to swap in before doing something. We need less perks like this, not more.
---
i also feel the same as you my post always get downvoten
---
Sweet! 
---
Not sure, soon find out I guess, the stuff others sell shows, so maybe Not?
---
Someone notify me tomorrow when this gets posted again.
---
And then of course, diluting then while having chemist and super duper perks equipped will last for a good while
---
You have to server hop usually for plans. Go to a vendor you like, log out and back in. Their inventory will have changed  and you'll be in a new server. Hope you enjoy the game
---
Yeah...likely...
---
I’m not online right now I’ll add you, I think I’ll be able to come online tonight. My gt is Xindependent77 xxxjrobbxxx
---
Imagine the hell that will be raised by both sides if it isnt...
---
Mutations are only good if you slot into starched genes. They are expensive, and not that crazy. Agility for sure with perception are going to be your best friends.
---
Thanks for the camp idea! I set up 3 water pumps and I go back and fourth and drink till I mutate then Walt to the whitesprings service entrance and use the rad showers then server hop and it’s been working great!
---
That's the one! Economically, its probably the best C.A.M.P location I've found yet. I just hate the Ash Heap region, its ugly to me, great game design, just not somewhere I'd choose to live in the apocalypse. I think I placed my C.A.M.P and extractors there, saw it worked, and then decided to move it again almost instantly. 
---
Just hit me up
---
So charisma past 25 offers no additional benefit, however minimal? With 15 base charisma, magnetic personality for 6 more, and hard bargain for a functional charisma of 30, without factoring drugs or alcohol, which with party boy to increase effects of alcohol combined with grape mentats might be possible to break 40 points. Although I’d never reach that as I don’t have a charisma build I’m curious if it increase even by a little, say a 200 value item selling for even a single more cap, or perhaps as few as 5 caps off the mutation serum? The returns would likely be to small to be practical, but the ocd would be interesting in knowing. 
---
I just hunt down wanted players because I want to finish the \[Kill 76 wanted players\] challenge. I don't even take their junk.
---
I haven’t seen any scorchbeasts either.
---
&gt; Move on like most of us did
---
And yet you're wasting your time trolling here
---
What a dumb ass
---
If you use the pump it's very slow, but you can spam the water in a river or whatever to get a lot fast, It shouldn't take that long.
---
Back when the game had the negative carry weight glitch, I once deposited 3000 rounds of .308.
---
Even if they took tokens and dispensed nonsensical generalities, like in IRL, only horrible and post apocalyptic and/or jingostic.
---
 Cheers :)
---
Nope only the Nula Cola machine
---
if you dissent, you're downboated. this sub is reddit at its best: a hivemind.
---
Good to hear. Good luck!
---
I haven’t seen a single scorchbeast either.
---
I don't think it tells you. Push start, go to settings&gt;Gameplay&gt;Pacifist Mode
---
Add a one-way recipe to convert purified water to boiled water. 
---
I don't necessarily want to call it rare, but I've never found one in a vendor in my many hours of playing.
---
I think, generally, the baseball bat is outclassed by the Sledgehammer, Super Sledge and Fire Axe.  But it's still a useful weapon when passing through the Forest.  It's difficult to find one with a high level because it only tends to show up in lower-level parts of the world.
---
You need to stop
---
Yes that as well I was at the bottom near prime and nothing I noticed that too
---
Seems to be down for everyone. 
---
I’ll do it, I’ll hit you up on Reddit got a communication ban on Xbox  :/
---
Keep up the good work.
---
Please prioritize stable servers, weapon balance (hello laser weapons), rebalance enemy armor and mandatory armor piercing perks, maybe address mandatory perk switching (switching lockpicking / hacking / crafting perks), lack of head armor for non-PA users, give us a non glass cannon alternative for the Hazmat Suit and maybe unlockable faction flags + C.A.M.P items.
---
Happy new Year
---
What level are you? The pieces will usually spawn in at a higher level, so if you’re past 15 you’re unlikely to get level 15 pieces.
---
This speaks volumes of how "ported from fo4" this game is. With that said I  will still enjoy it for its half-assed, broken game that it is.  (500+hrs)
---
Lol sounds good my dude
---
Keep your hopes up! I've only found a couple great weapons, and I didn't get my first two shot or explosive weapon until level 112. I just found my first two shot explosive (level 35 the dragon) at level 142.
---
Currently at 15
---
Pretty hostile TYS there buddy. Simmer down now.
---
I can see my point was proven.
---
They’re easier if you stick to one, because you’ll learn the layouts faster. 
---
Can you explain to me how to do that?
---
I've fought at least 3-4 near the fissure sites. The sites are "closed" atm, but they're still spawning at least.
---
Thank you. I will try that next time
---
Well, the one near Flatwoods will power the food generator at the workshop nearby if the power plants have been repaired.
---
I thought that was their purpose...
---
I've scouted that area! There's a really cool vibe around Harper's Ferry, with some awesome lighting around the cliffs and bridges. You should throw some screenshots on r/fallout76settlements, I love seeing other people's ideas in their C.A.M.Ps.
---
You can craft cures, perks make that cheaper/easier. You can put points in endurance or just a few and get natural resistance. You can get the plague walker mutation and make some positive use of those diseases. You can selectively use cures when you get ones that are really bad and ignore others that don't effect your build/playstyle.   
---
The disease system isn't anything fantastic but it does add a little to the survival systems. My only point is you've got options for how to handle it. 
---
You guys must be right. I never scrap anything completely out. Especially steel, I never go below 100 of it. I cant figure out which mat it was that used them. I feel like a majority of them were steel. It may have used them up when I repaired the extractors during the event. It takes 10 steel a piece and even though the mods were in my stash, it is the only thing that makes sense. I still have over 100 steel, wood, aluminum, black titanium and pretty much any mat that comes from mods. 
---
I have been using the same numbers to bulk the whole time. I didn't do anything different yesterday except that event and I definitely repaired a few times since I was doing it alone. There are some places in the game (Whitespring Bunker is one) that somehow can use items out of your stash to craft. Somehow it defaulted to use mod steel instead of steel scrap on me or out of my stash. Which I may have been low on steel on me. I'm not sure.
---
Anyways thanks for the psa. I'll be more cautious of it from now on.
---
I know how it sounds, a guy did kill me in fallout 76 over and over and I told him to stop but he did it again even though I didn’t shot back at him, so I called him asshole, and that’s why I got a ban 
---
Agreed, corn, mainly for corn soup which satisfies food and water.  But I also grow tatos and mutfruit if adhesives become a problem
---
Whitespring should be its own alternate dimension instance. Ok maybe not entirely, maybe a dedicated "trading floor" where you get a prompt that you're leaving the server. 
---
Partial instanced city for trading hub has been in online shared-world games since forever. Very appropriate for fo76.
---
When you say tree you mean the perk card system right? You've got perk cards that fall under different perks, and some perk cards have level requirements just like skills in previous fallout's did. The only thing different with this system is that you can switch out skills with others based on the situation.
---
Food and water is a bit of a pain in the early game, but all it takes is a quick hunting trip for animals/veggies - Flatwoods has some pre-planted you can take from, as well as plenty of brahmin. Cook em all up and you're gonna be good for a long while, granted you do need to drink/eat more often than I'd like but again, there's perks for that. At this point, it's a complete non-issue once you level past 10 or so.
---
Yeah, I checked your pic that's what surprised me. For some reason, everytime I repair my Grognak's Axe and Deathclaw Gauntlet, I only get the 100% condition. I'll try with a Ripper or something.
---
I'll do you one better. I hope you dug up the grave to get some cloth and bone.
---
I'm gonna try it and see what happens. Will I have to scrap all my buildings?
---
Hadn’t noticed the lack of scorch beasts.   To me, they’re part of the worst aspects of the game.  Their spam attack is awful and the consistent frame rate drops and server issues with the queen are much in need of fixing. 
---
So this is interesting, if they’ve been removed to be corrected.  Others have suggested Bethesda simply “forgot” to turn them back on.  I find this very suspect, despite their track record.  
---
 https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1080188836993515521 
---
Sounds about right😂
---
They don’t always start until someone is near the plant. I noticed this because I set my camp near one. So, like prison break, you’ll need to fast travel to check availability. 
---
In Star Wars Galaxies there are factions Imperial and Rebel. In the game you could register with a faction and become an active combatant. Basically enabling PvP. You would talk to a faction officer or whatever to activate and deactivate it. It would be cool if there was something like that in FO76. A way to enable PvP and fight other factions consentually. In SWG you would wear faction armor also which was only available to that faction, so it incentivized it a little to get the cool armor.
---
I only use PA when going into nuke zone, game becomes more fun and challenging. But it's true that some hats/suits are not so easy to come by unless you have each one on your stash.
---
I'd rather eliminate the "trade with a player" one cause any challenge that requires action from another than oneself hurts the lone wolves out there.
---
Pretty sure it's either or; if a sleeping bag doesn't work try a dirty bed. 
---
I have tested it quite heavily using a wide range of lvls and accounts. 2 wood foundations and 7 wood walls take up 2% of your budget always, leading for pretty firm evidence that the increase is bogus.
---
They don't show for me, thx for the though tho
---
Nice try, MI6
---
I think it's more "I don't like this opinion/statement .. whatever really." So just like on youtube, you just hit the thumbs down and move on.
---
I respect this kind of focus. And so does Sierra Petrovita.
---
There has to be a middle ground. Some weapons can do more but never a 1 hit kill 
---
I wouldn't point fingers at r/Fallout necessarily, but yes, we appear to be getting brigaded by someone right now.
---
Ahhhhhh that explains it! I will do that straight away in about 10 mins when i log on and get insta dc'd
---
Worth a shot...
---
I agree, but I never have enough plastic for my shotgun shells. 
---
It does work much faster. 
---
I tend to lock the doors with lvl 0 locks, then barricade said doors with concrete defenses and port-a-potties. So far, its worked very well. 
---
Oh too bad, I'm not the one who asked but I definitely would've given you a jetpack if you had been on PC lol. 
---
I desperately need to know if you got any unique dialogue and what it was 
---
She he is trying to PR his way out. Stay quiet and you will receive 10 atoms as compensation
---
That guy sounds like an asshole.
---
Inspect it in your inventory 
---
Did you find the lettering plans or pay the 10k caps?
---
Two weeks without any communication 😂
---
Wear them when your not in your power armor.  
---
You're lucky. I seem to spawn into them every server I hop too. 
---
I checked the other day and found I was hauling around 50... 50 power cores... wtf?! That's almost as bad as the 1200 gun powder I was hauling around.
---
Yes the nuke system is broken right now. There is no further information. We don't know why it's broken, and we don't know when it will be fixed. 
---
Corn is a great option. It, boiled water, and wood, can produce corn soup which heals 10% food, 15% water, has no disease chance, and gives 5 rads as well as +3 AP regen for 30 minutes while only weighing 0.5 lbs. If you find yourself in need of adhesive you can also plant mutfruit and tatos alongside the corn to produce vegetable starch. 
---
Grab a power plant workshop and set up the fusion core maker. You should have free power to do so if you do the "powering up" event at the plants next to them, and even some of the substations. 
---
Scrap em if u can. If not sell to vendor
---
Yep works on my junk extractor but not on my lead extractor
---
Yeah, it's common. We cleared them out once in an attempt to keep the server up for longer.
---
License or not, delivering a non-working product, even software, would definitely be an easy case here in the EU.
---
In this case it's not totally not working. It's just... more or less functional, some / most of the time, depending on the player, the server, the other players, the phase of the moon and the goodwill of some Irish leprechauns ?
---
Only an estimate. Actual price may legally be up to 10% higher after completion.
---
I'm also bugged. Even tried listening to the tapes in the suggested chronological order to no joy.
---
I did the queen again yesterday and none of us got rad damage and my gun broke yet it still fired even after I died frame rate was very bad. But today I have seen a single SB at all I was gonna launch a nuke but cant lol 
---
It could take tokens
---
16 times
---
You’ll see them IRL too, they’re basically where the high output of the main plant gets managed out to local zones. You’ll see them in game as fenced off areas, with one shed, and probably about the same footprint as 2 explorable houses. 
---
User name checks out. 
---
I can visit the sub to check the progress of the game and give criticism, whether I currently play it or not, positive or negative, so settle down.  I put enough time into the game to give my 2 cents.  Sorry it's not a "OMG I love this game!" Post.  Negative feedback and frustration should be just as welcome as the positive, so long as it's not overly excessive.  When you log on the front page of the sub and see a list of compounded bugs/glitches/duping/crashing, I think it warrants people to voice their opinion.  
---
Can't wait for all the Dupers to finally get to capitalize on all their hard work! 
---
Papa Nurgle Disliked that.
---
If you have a quest item and die, your other items are not able to be picked up -- 
---
Still got that 2 shot single action sitting around?
---
Remove pacifist mode entirely. Spice up the game. Disable team mate damage so co-op is ok. 
---
Same, issue that keeps stinging me is how would I compete with a duper? I've got the healing mutation so stims are almost useless for me, so i can sell stims cheaper at 5c but would you rather buy stims for 5c, or from a duper at 1c. 
---
First try here. I had already randomly found one of the plans and purchased another, so the fusion generator dropped on my first and ONLY Power Up event. I was crying from laughing so hard, because I spent so long looking for that stupid plan.
---
Hear us, Bethesda!
---
Sounds good to me. Unfortunately im not who needs to see this. 
---
Yeah...a difference of opinion means a down vote..it's dumb..if you enjoy the game the slightest and talk about that it's gonna get crushed by the haters.
---
It’s Y2K19
---
I have a feeling the recipe system just can't support the idea of "This OR that."  Is there any proof that it can?
---
Harvesting Boiled Water doesn't take that long though.  You just go up to a river and mash the collect button.  Regardless of how much the text lags behind, you collect one Dirty Water with each press immediately.
---
If you ain't drinking Nuka Cola™, you ain't living!
---
God fucking damn it. I wish I had known.
---
"Glamping" shouldn't even be a word, let alone a thing people do. Take my downvote. 
---
Sure does.
---
No, they can't see you or your camp...at your level it shouldn't cost but a few caps.
---
Also, INT should increase chances of discovering mods. The stat's passives are so garbage atm. And I mean, it's INT.
---
Took me a long time to figure this out. Luckily I refuse to ditch any legendaries.
---
Turns out my Nocturnal The Dragon is actually an *Explosive* Nocturnal the Dragon. With explosive and rifleman perks it goes up to about 1400 damage at night. Not the best, but pretty good. 
---
Now the keycard isn't working the cargobot now gets to about 1/4 health and refills health even server hopped and still doing it 
---
"Player vending"
---
Duper: *EXPLOITING INTENSIFIES*
---
None of the weight reducing perks effect stash weights. What would happen if you load it up then take off perks reducing weights by 90%?
---
Are you in Xbox?
---
We need a buff to quantity of ammo crafted
---
What’s different? Nothing from the CAMP owner’s POV. You log in and place your CAMP as per normal unless someone else has an active CAMP. I guess I’m not seeing the concern here? 
---
It would be exactly like if you disconnected now. Since you can’t go back to the server you left, it’s like it never existed for your character. A copy of your CAMP is left behind to fade away like a fart on the wind...
---
Speaking of jetpack, I don't understand how ppl are selling serums for 1k, but x01 jetpack is 4, 5k. I bought a calibrated shock from modus for 500 and traded it for a jetpack.
---
PlayStation
---
They should just be misc items and not made up of scrappable components. It’s just not useful
---
Yea, I get the difference of opinion...  But it's not always posts involving any sort of opinion.  A statement, a question, a story... downvoted. I believe there's motive behind it, whatever that may be.
---
Platform
---
Yeah, I got a furious mr. Handy last night and it is absolutely ridiculous after repairing and the base 2h perks.
---
Truth 😂😂😂😂😂
---
It’s Y2K19.
---
We need a buff if 308 for the LMG all day
---
its the "small letters" plan, a friend found it out in the world in watoga and gave it to me because he knew i was looking for it.
---
Honestly, I don't see how they can until we have interactions with NPCs.  Otherwise, it can only be more chasing ghosts.
---
I like this both for the useful tip and in agreement that the HUD for PA is awful. Prettysure my only deaths in it have come from not noticing the HP. And the '76 specific stuff llke Food/Water and Team member bars straight up don't mix into it.
---
Someone else guessed it’s bots someone setup because of the hate this game gets. It isn’t unusual for games that don’t have a great release or somehow have pissed people off. No Man’s Sky was a shitstorm for awhile and I still think new posts there eat many downvotes before it picks up from users upvotes.
---
They only provide 10 energy but if you repair the nuclear reactor like posiden or thunder mountain 
---
Then they provide 100 energy but you don't need a substation once you have a fusion generator which provides 100 energy 
---
I just found an MG last night.  Is it decent?  I also found a tse .50 cal, and the .50 was my weapon of choice but I find the tse just trivializes everything about the game so I probably wont use it except for scorch beasts.
---
I think it's still the case that only aluminium and lead are worth bulking except for selling. 
---
Even if they buffed it i wouldnt use the lmg due to not having mods
---
It's weird that screws are the thing that are hard to get out of things, I mean like ... just unscrew them. Boom. Screw. 
---
Yeah, that'll probably happen. Fuck dupers, they're going to ruin this game at this rate.
---
Makes sense. My farm is at the acid pit across the valley from the lighthouse so for my vendor runs I usually walk down to Sutton and then fast travel to the others counterclockwise. Whitesprings to watoga isn't cheap but i started picking up all the crap junk around the vendors and it pays for a fair amount of it. But all the good scrap places to the west are too popular and I'm not as squishy, about to hit 45 so I might just have to build a new set of PA and start heading east. 
---
I’ve looted plenty of dog armor off of mutants hounds but off the queen is kinda funny
---
Honestly I agree with this. Swapping craft exclusive perks is a pain. 
---
Awesome! Thank you. 
---
Yeah I was pretty disappointed when I'd collected a bunch of tokens and saw the fortune teller which is not an asset I recognise from FO4 but then couldn't interact with it. 
---
They don't matter, all Stash containers share inventory.
---
I chuckled when I came across that and took a similar photo in the "throne".  There is a real life Carhenge in Alliance, Nebraska so it was fun to find one in Appalachia. 
---
You can also use corn to make adhesive
---
I have two of these sitting in my inventory currently hoping that maybe we get dog companions in the future, but that's just wishful thinking.  During the queen fight sometimes attack dogs spawn wearing accessories like in Fallout 4 and their loot tables seemed to have been ported over without adjustment.
---
In Nuke Zones you need either Power Armor or a Hazmat suit currently. Its effectively a requirement. 
---
If you want to go into nukes without PA I would recommend using a hazmat suit with perks/mutations like Ironclad, Barbarian, Grounded, Scaly Skin, etc. 
---
They just need 1 Recipe that makes Boiled Water from Purified.
---
Damn you Rosie 
---
It's a busy. Been happening to a lot of us since beta.
---
Honestly, I don't really like this. It'd just be one more thing I'd feel like I'd need to swap in and out a whole bunch, and I'm tired of that as it is.
---
Really. agh
---
best advice I can give you there is to check the vendor bots at the train stations.  though its just cosmetic.  All stash boxes in your CAMP will share the same inventory and weight limit.
---
Excavator plans are sold by vendors in Ash Heap and Savage Divide (Responder vendors), I don't think you can find them other places.
---
You were down voted for being a jackass. 
---
Or at least not get rads when collecting water. 
---
Darn...I'm XBOX or I'd hook you up...I assure you, for ever assmunch out there there are 3 good guys 
---
Still broken in 2019!  We did it Reddit!
---
Still down xb1
---
Fissures also got blocked along with the nukes being disabled.
---
Workshop defense events will give you a random CAMP plan as a reward, and I think completing the quest to claim/reclaim it has given me plans as well every time. Not guaranteed to be a new one, just random. Footlockers, metal boxes, and toolboxes are very common drops.
---
I have a 4-star machete, added a star by making a sacrificial blade. 
---
You are a lucky individual.
---
Yup, i'll usually clear them out for the XP.
---
It's good with the big guns perks to give it the buff it really needs, the MG42 one is gonna chew through all your 308, the 50 cal MG is okay because it has quantity craftability, I personally love the gatling.
---
Also, none of these are great against scorch beasts, they really dont do too good, I prefer the plasma gatling over almost anything else for SBs, the kinetic big guns are terrible at the range a scorch beast flies.
---
The problem is that it would need a rework of the crafting system to just allow a substitute item. With the current system, they'd need a separate recipe for each recipe that calls for boiled water. 
---
You can see it on [that map](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i_made_a_map_of_resource_deposits/)
---
Look for the big lake on the map in Forrest region. 
---
I agree, it'd be basically mandatory for optimal play, and I'd have to be swapping it on and off a whole bunch, which happens with too many other Perks already and is tedious.
---
I was so disappointed when I couldn't interact with it. I can settle with just the fortune cookie esque preset qoutes. 
---
I have to be honest: I would miss my little 'out building' that houses my fusion reactor. It's this cute little red barn shack elevated on concrete to protect it.
---
Theres a lot of mods for the LMG and the Gatling, the 50 cal only has barrel and reciever.
---
It's just a matter of how garbage the mod drop rate is and getting MG42s and others are, I was lucky to find the LMG blueprint
---
It can't. You can find instances of this in FO4 where there are multiple ways to make the same item - you end up with a recipe for each variant ingredient list. 
---
I’m on Xbox sorry 
---
A bot would make sense, that's something I didn't think of.  However...  wtf!?  Really people?!
---
I mutated Carnivore a long time ago so I subsist solely on ionized meat and purified water
---
There are a large number of workshops that get power from the plants
---
"AH HAH HA HA HAAAAA"  - Rose
---
I didn’t find my first pieces of lvl 15 raider pa till I was level 18. It’s just random what spawns in at each spawn point
---
Pacifist means that you don't want to hurt other people, not that they don't want to hurt you. 
---
Well, I downvote any posy that repeats a common question that has already been asked and answered literally dozens of times. There is a search function for a reason.
---
How exactly do you see the effects and stars? By inspecting?
---
When you repair it, click off and click back on.  I have to do that to see additionally durability.  
---
If you're referring to the tall white ones, they're in the **Defenses** category. They're really neat, too, because they can be snapped together in several ways: straight, at an angle, and even at offset heights.
---
This is explains so fucking much.   Why wasn't this being more widely reported?   
---
I've gone wanted a few times out of boredom or desperate need for screws, but I've never repeatedly killed anyone. There should be an escalated penalty for repeatedly killing someone who hasn't attacked you back. 
---
thanks to the last patch, it always will be. Just choose another server.
---
But every storage container shares inventory regardless if its called (stash), right?
---
Glad I’m not the only one. What gives? We should at least be able to zoom in or something..
---
There is a stimpak recipe available for purchase.  With chemist and super duper perks, then converting them further into diluted stimpaks you'll be selling off any extra stims you find because of the overabundance. 
---
What level is it? I'll take it!
---
The_rane_man
---
and now Im no longer excited. 10 wouldn't power all of my lights, let alone my whole camp.
---
Radshield is what, 300 rad resist? They don't last long, but I run t-51b which only has 370 rad resist so it's an option.
---
Also our group usually has someone run and share Rad Sponge which helps a ton. That said, when rad-x/shield wears off it's gonna be ugly.
---
This. I learned that the hard way by thinking he couldn’t hurt me unless I fired back, only to get completely destroyed the second he started claiming the workshop. 
---
its easier to just plant food.
---
Its been said I'm sure, but even little mini games like playing pool/cards/ etc with other players would greatly increase the enjoyment. Give us a reason to hang out at a dudes camp, and something to do while that one guy is "opti-mazing" his setup, or afk I can never tell.
---
Oh, I meant that Bethesda would have to do that. It would be a relatively simple way to solve it without having to duplicate every recipe. 
---
If you know what enemies to farm, you can get screws easily once you have a max build, wendigos and megasloths always drop screws when you kill them
---
also rads
---
“Weekly events” worries me... please don’t force players to participate in things that will be required in order to progress such as Destiny 2 has become 
---
Explosive shotgun.  But you die...  a lot. 
---
Just got a two shot guass that’s fun to play around with. Just feels slow compared to shotty.  
---
to bad, but that does work if I find someone with the gamma gun plan I can just grind mods that way?
---
Maybe its that because i have scrapped a few lmgs and still 0 mods for it, i think the only mod i have for the gatling is the drum magazine... Im going to stay with my shotguns.
---
Watoga is a pretty good source of legendaries.  There are at least two robots that are consistently legendary when I visit.  You can also do Monster Mash which spawns waves of enemies, some of them are three-star legendaries.
---
There is a pixel map that has been posted:https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i_made_a_map_of_resource_deposits/
---
The real question is.. what happens to the prefabs from fo4? I would love to have something more than box camp even if it's a prefeb. The tent looks nice but is always broken on moving.
---
It doesn't provide more power than a fusion generator only if you repair the nuclear reactor plant then it provided 100 power I'd recommend sticking to your fusion generator 
---
I haven't seen any duping but duping will come back in way or another so a better way must be created
---
And I get that as well, it's quite annoying seeing the same post over and over.  Now let me ask you this...  Has this topic been discussed before, and if so did you downvote me because of it? Lol. I've wondered about this topic for a while and never saw a post about it...  However I did not search for it in advance.
---
It would be a good idea. 
---
No dude im not leveling another character to 200+ and another to 60
---
Those substations are supposed to be part of the power grid. I think they are either bugged or unfinished. 
---
Current codes? 
---
yeah I just read that below. 10 power isn't enough to turn on all of my lights. :(
---
IMO, if it totally wiped out duping, 100%, I'd be happy with a full reset.
---
There's a lot of other changes that are also needed first, like a reliable way to farm legendaries that's fun and accessible.  Maybe a mail system for sending items and trading, maybe an auction house. 
---
More sensible PvP rules are needed as well, more useful workshops etc.
---
But with the pieces in place I'd have no problems starting over.
---
She's impressed you actually befriended the deathclaw, I managed to do it when I did the quest and thought it was the intended ending. There's unique dialog for it. She tells you not to trust everything you see and hear in the wasteland
---
To enlarge your front size, I'd recommend pounding a few jars of mayo a week, lots of beer, potato chips, and french fries.
---
Theres a drum magazine for the gatling?!
---
Big guns desperately needs a boost to mod drops.
---
Like I said I use traveling pharmacy which reduces the weight of stim packs by 90%
---
All the ones I've seen thus far allow you to build INSIDE the gates.
---
I was hoping it was something cool but I can live with this I guess haha
---
The only thing that triggers me is that your character builds windows that are already broken. I get if you only have shitty scrap wood to build walls and floor with, but why are you installing a broken pane of glass?
---
I'm not interested in PVP so I'm not bothered if everyone is running around with duped explosive weapons.  I've pretty run out of things to do so I would gladly take new content over a wipe.
---
Crazy talk, maybe for Fallout 96
---
So you are saying an average of 76 degrees?
---
Who is paying you people to make these player wipe posts?
---
These are the silliest things and they won't die.
---
And why put a value on an item in your inventory when a bot pays 1 cap. I still just don't understand why it says the value is 50 and I receive 1 cap from a sale.
---
Oh fuck yeah.
---
Yes you can find a plan to create some and then grind to make mods. I can confirm that it works.
---
I tried that, but since Grognak's doesn't have any mods, it dissapears from the repair list as soon as I'm done :(
---
I'll try with other weapons later, thanks for the help!
---
Yeah instead of the standard magazine is a drum on top of the gun though the reload speed is awful.
---
To mod drops and damage please.
---
Yes. Only safe storage is shared Stash. Any thing that you build that stores items will be shared.
---
That makes sense.
---
Just had bad luck yesterday, and the dude deliberately took all junk in front of my eyes.
---
I temporarily had my camp here. Not a bad spot
---
I must imagine they rebooting often, but who knows, I would also speculate the servers are crashing when we get booted, but who knows if everyone gets kicked or just some of us .. I must think they reboot periodically .. just seems like a bad design to me.
---
sweet ty
---
Does the big power plant have to be fixed before this works?
---
See in this instance I tried that but I was less fortunate. Also hey fam. You play this often too? I'm guessing on pc, but that's still pretty cool to see you here. 
---
It's probably a car blowing up.. Happens to me alot.
---
I bet their code handling the nukes is thinking we have 01/01/2018.
---
Game isn't out yet, so no nukes are available. 
---
I’m glad they’re providing patches and don’t mean to sound ungrateful, but they’re hemorrhaging players because game breaking bugs go unfixed for too long.  
---
There should have been a patch on Christmas Day at the latest which addressed the constant server crashes, duping, and critical issues with the only endgame content - SBQ - not dropping loot correctly and in a timely manner.  
---
Unless this patch is monumental and fixes all of the critical bugs, a lot of the minor ones, and adds some QoL stuff I’m probably done too. Progress to turn this game into something with long term viability is far too slow.  
---
I’d rather be doing Behemoth on MH:W.
---
Your stuff will just be stored, and will be able to be placed when your CAMP is moved.
---
Do you have the mutation unstable issatop?
---
My bad, I didn't search. Didn't think of it being that common of a thought.
---
No. In hard locations like golf club it’s 75+ degrees, other places 68-72
---
They just need to build a toolset that tells if multiple items have the same id. They can already do this but not in bulk on this level then remove extras
---
No, why should we all be wiped because of a bunch of dupers and cheaters. Besides I still don't understand what the issue is with dupers other than they have the advantage at PVP with OP weapons, what am I missing ? Who cares if someone has all the weapons or 10,000 of them .. I get it is not ideal and I don't agree with it, but what is the biggest issue. Personally they should be banned if caught exploiting ..
---
He’s got hundreds.
---
Cranberries for the +exp.  
---
I think it’s good, right ?
---
It comes off as stupid because you make an assumption thinly disguised as conjecture and then proceed to show you believe it. 
---
But we all know that will never be the case, they fix one glitch and they find another, it's like GTA, they barely could keep up with them, but they certainly tried .. I doubt they will ever be able to fully stop duping ..
---
Oh...so you have to be out of combat for it to kick in? That makes so much more sense. 
---
I think a hard wipe would be okay in the long run if it was a material possession wipe, I think that would effect everyone equally and wouldn't hard set everyone back to lvl 1 I get the feeling alot of people would stop playing and possibly lose their mind even more. There's someone on ebay making $44.88 a sale for a stack of 7 duped weapons. They've sold it 12 times that means they've made a ridiculous amount of real world money doing this. I would love to start making money in a legit way selling a 3* legendary for like $5 (it's in almost any game these days from Diablo to cs:go) 
---
If you’re after plastic (like me) don’t forget Watoga high school. Close to the train station and has something like 130ish pieces per run plus about 45 lead from cans of paint
---
You should just be able to zoom in and move it around maybe. For us people with smaller or farther away screens some things are just impossible to read. I miss being able to zoom in on terminals while hacking.
---
Yes, it was some quest before that because I just did that this session. 
---
We could also have periodic defence quests against Scorchbeasts, Deathclaws or maybe unique enemies, like the Razorback Armada or Formorian in Warframe
---
I assume they make you read them first so that if you get a double of something, you can sell it/give it to someone. They probably figured that would be better than some way of ensuring you dont get extras of the same plans.
---
You have? Didnt know they existed...
---
Sometimes this will work, more often for me it wont. Cant hurt to try when it happens tho.
---
Have to agree. If i played any game that much i would burn out too. 
---
With so many hours in a game, we sure got the money worth. 
---
Been playing F76 since release. Now im back playing assassins creed odyssey. Not becaurse im bored of F76, but i usually play several games and switch between them.
---
O pooo not special then a bloody dirty duper. :(
---
So they haven't made lots of improvements?
---
1) PC
---
4) After the last patch ( or the one before) the game locks up when spawning and an event starts at the same time in that location. Lets say I fast travel to flatwoods and the mr farmhand quest triggers, locks game. Trevel to the grafton dam to kill the wanted supermutant, lockup at spawn. Travel in to one of your workshops and a defence mission starts, lock up and loss of workshops. 
---
The game has to be killed with task manager when this happens. 
---
True.
---
Oh my god please I actually have a pair of binoculars I keep next to my seat just so I can read the damn stuff (I’m not kidding I really do)
---
You don't have to PVP if you don't want to.  
---
I've had several higher level players shit me to try and get me to PVP with them, but I just wave and go do other things.
---
I received it at level 90, so I assume it's max level. I'll message you
---
Yes i have, sold it, still didnt do enough damage to warrant the weight
---
Crap my cover has been blown 
---
I think some might be surprised how often they miss these fuckers.
---
If you havent already, get the Card Perk that plays a directional audio when near a capstash.
---
Sometimes youll find them in bushes, between the crevice of a shelf and floor, between an appliance and wall, etc.
---
They intentional hide them.
---
Should be stored, hopefully they fixed some of these issues, I noticed things seem to work better. I would still keep your generators on a foundation for now to be safe, but is probably not needed. I don't pack my stuff away and so far have been ok. I have been hit a few times with someone else camp in my spot and it restores all my stuff, even stuff I haven't blueprinted, so looks like improvements are working.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Nukes are down?
---
I wish containers bought and placed in C.A.M.P would have been both a higher weight limit and lootable by other players.... 
---
You also receive a random power generator for repairing the big power plant like nuclear fusion or a large generator 
---
Thought for sure Seneca peaks would have some teddy bears staged or something. 
---
Can you actually use the artillery?
---
I've had scoredbeasts on my xb1 game about 20 minutes ago.
---
Ok. I'm level 48 but I can grind to 50 for it!
---
Let me know I'll be around till 345ish central time zone
---
Nukes aren't working rn
---
I used to have an executioner's one, then I sold it. I've also seen people trading two shot explosive miniguns
---
I second this.
---
i sold a exploding minigun for 4k caps
---
They said we will be getting more stash space and other long term changes, hopefully unlinking containers .. so hopefully they follow thru with what they said. I recommend people still keep asking for more stash on @fallout and keep it fresh in their minds. I am sure it is coming, hopefully we will see something with the 15th Jan Update.
---
Unless it has a weight limit like Stash. Hard to fit 600 TSE Handmades into a 400lb box 🤣
---
Nuke silos have been down since last night. Unless there has been a change, silos are currently inaccessible. Are you able to enter a nuke silo?
---
But with rank 3 of batteries included they weigh 0.1
---
Sweet, you took my information that I posted literally the other day and didn't credit me. Thanks :) 
---
Holy hell though you are comparing a game that has literally been out for less than 7 weeks to games that have been out way longer. 
---
Give BGS a little time.   It’s a little unfair to expect DLC and expansions when the game hasn’t even been out 2 while damn months. Geez. 
---
That comparison really is depressing.
---
Im on ps4 haven't seen one at all today. Been playing about 5 hours today 
---
To counterpoint this, I will say that even if someone wanted to engage in PvP they are less likely to because they know there is a chance that person will have some ridiculous weapon. If duping was gone, you could engage in PvP knowing that if you got beat it was legit. Allowing dupers to exist deters people from engaging in PvP.
---
Also, in a PVE setting when a guy is running around one shotting shit before anyone else can tag it, it messes with you getting loot and experience. Yes, you could go somewhere else but it just takes away from the game that you could run into this kind of situation.
---
Does this take a half hour to reload?  :)
---
&gt; Gt: dallaselderbery
---
^ This is a cool cat who for no reason or benefit to himself helped a stranger - me - do the wendigo cave for main quest line weeks ago.  Thanks again dude!!
---
I love you. &lt;3
---
But I meant the c.a.m.p powered speakers you can make in game xD
---
Would you by chance have a level 15 raider power armor left arm?
---
Grats!!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/abg44l/nukes_are_disabled_for_new_years_heres_proof_now/
---
I have been using the Super Sledge and it is my primary weapon but I found a chained Baseball Bat which does a decent amount of damage and works better on certain enemies, that's my go to weapon now. Also the war drum is pretty decent. 
---
Super Sledge is better, but the baseball bat isn't bad for my build. I  have to however use the Super Sledge on Super Mutants as it is the most effective, but I start with the bat and see how it goes.
---
It affects other aspects of the game like killing nuke zone creatures before others have a chance for experience, for an example.
---
Not lucky enough to find anything fancy but been loving my instigating super sledge with the slugger perks and bloody mess now I'm trying to get the twisted muscles mutation and am on a strict glowing meat steak diet for the extra 10% typically I'm pushing I think 270ish last I checked I know it's close to 300.
---
The longest I had a camp in one spot was there. Had a stair case from the bottom going up and my house up against the bottom of the bridge. I used the letters to write "not a meth lab" on the door to that spot
---
So.... We won?
---
How'd you learn about this? 
---
One time i went to vault 76 to greet some new players. Was wearing my Nuka Cola power armor and using that flag emote from the atom shop to looks super friendly. Dropped a bag of 20 purified waters.
---
They punched me and ran away.
---
How do you properly look at the item to see all the effects (PC)?
---
I somewhat found drill is making more damage than rest of these; chansaw,ripper etc. also  drill has a armor penetration mod that makes it a long/ish weapon that drills from long-ish distance.
---
Thanks for the info and tip!
---
So it was an issue, not just something for their proposed Whitespring party?
---
Ugh, I hope not, then we'd probably have the same issues as with taking a Workshop and getting disconnected 🤦
---
Make sure to block them so you never join the same server as them in the future.
---
Or just add a terminal like modus in some area with interserver auction House for online and offline trading, also add the option to build one in your Camp too.
---
I have started looking, but haven't seen it yet. If you find a bat, you should be able to modify it with the right perks, you may not need a plan. If you on XB1, I can modify one for you if you need, just get the make shift warrior perk to level  2.
---
PS4 has a magnifying feature that you can enable somewhere, and lets you press the PS button and square button at the same time to zoom in on the screen, and lets you use the right stick to move where you're zooming in. Locks you out of the other controls until you hit the PS button again.
---
you know lots of games do this right?
---
Even though they do know people will be spending time with family etc. 
---
This is literally just some PR.
---
If you're on PS4 I can sell you one with 3 stars, or a 2 shot 1 Star Gatling gun. They are not the same weapon
---
I haven't even gotten conduits yet. Fml
---
I've found a few 1* ones and there's a popular two shot exploding one on the markets.
---
And did you ser how he used “.jpeg” in there too? Like, how sick is that bro.
---
I was told it was some super low useless number that it went up by every shot. Something like 1-2%  seems this one needs a bit of testing lol. 
---
I’d try r/fo76bazaar r/fo76Market or r/unionmerchant76
---
It actually does. I found an "electrofusion" mod for it. 
---
I noticed the same thing since last night. Fissures aren't spawning scorchbeasts. I've found a few but not outside of events. 
---
Does the perk also reduce the weight of power cores in your stash box?
---
Sry on xbox
---
Found two at a police station, let me know if you still looking and I will find the location, also think I spotted them at a vendor as well.
---
I also have 3 pairs, so if you on XB1, you welcome to 1 of them ..
---
Yeah I could see where your own connection could get overloaded and then the game kicks you. I would suggest teaming up with anyone you see and then you could rejoin if the server was still up but you crashed out. Solo is rolling the dice for sure. 
---
I find steel to be quite the bottleneck in this game that I didnt anticipate. Gunpowder doesnt grow on trees either. I'm not suffering from ammo shortages but I'm not drowning in the stuff either.
---
I was testing a plasma rifle and I was curios so I went to the substaion and i tested if I could put my camp down and I could but my camp there.
---
I'm hoping Bethesda does what they said they'd do when they increased from 400 to 600.  Which was that they'd probably increase the storage limit again.
---
One thing to do to reduce weight is to bulk aluminum, lead, and acid.  Acid magically gains quantity, 15 bulked vs 10 to make a bulk, lead and aluminum bulked are lighter.  Everything else you can leave as scrap.  Things like asbestos, silver, antiseptic, and a few other items you really don't need much of at all so you can bulk and then sell off a lot of your junk.
---
Also go into your junk tab and check to make sure everything is scraped, some things don't automatically scrap because they're also crafting components.  Composite skis and beer bottles are a couple examples, they make ski swords and Molotovs respectively.
---
Stuff like stim packs, food and drinks, etc..., weigh their full weight in your stash as opposed to less if you have traveling pharmacy for instance which reduces weight of several meds to 1/10th their weight at rank 3.  So it's better to carry them on you then stash them.  I have traveling pharmacy 3 and have roughly 60 stims on me at the moment, which weighs 6lbs in my inventory, and in my stash it eats 60lbs.
---
There are several other weight reduction perks that you can put a point or two into to help you carry more shit at reduced weight as opposed to full weight in your stash.  My aid tab is probably the majority of my carrying weight, I have so much crap in there.
---
Managing stash and inventory weight is apparently the micro manage part of the game, sigh.
---
Weirdly I got mine in a different order - large, windmill, fusion.
---
Dunno why.
---
Are you saying yes, it's been posted before? Would you mind linking that post, because I did now search and found nothing.
---
I vote they reset their accounts and ban the most prevelant abusers.
---
I saw somewhere in game that the plant had to be repaired first.
---
They have to have the main power station like Poseidon or Whichever powers it to be running to gain power fyi. Hope this helps. It's not always 100% ongoing in your world you spawn into but it's a 10 minute quest to do. Best of luck.
---
See and that's where I disagree I'm almost level 100 been playing since the beta I love how I can either play some quest or just mindlessly walk around doing whatever I want farm build explore or whatever I think you need to take a different angle on the game to enjoy it maybe?
---
Eh after I had done it once and knew the layout I found it pretty quick.
---
Not one I’d seek out to do, but it wasn’t terrible.
---
Building is a big part of the game for me. Once I finish the main story and do everything else, I think I’ll spend some time creating different bases. I'm also going to need to respec my character as I’ve made some mistakes. Should keep me going till the DLC and updates start kicking in.
---
I think the low server population will help alleviate that. Realistically speaking, they can't get rid of all the duped items without punishing many innocent people who could have spent a good chunk of all they own in this game to get one that they never knew was duped. Based on what we know from support tickets, it also seems highly unlikely that they have the resources to track what's duped or who originally duped it. As sad as it is, what we will get will most likely be an eventual fix for duping that lets all the perpetrators go free.
---
So with that in mind, the fact that you will only have some 20 people on a server at a given time means it's fairly unlikely to find one of those big boy dupers with 40 two shot explosive handmades. It will certainly happen, but I'd also like to think that people will refuse to buy from somebody who has 24000 stable flux of every color or a hundred hunter's long coats
---
How do I get legendary weapons?
---
People will downvote for several reasons, though usually it's a "holier than thou" reason, meaning something along the line of "I don't agree with this post, and I'm always right, so I'll downvote, that'll show em!"
---
 these are the people that were never hugged as a kid.
---
10-15% i think
---
I just saw a Scorchbeast east of Arktos Pharma a few mins ago. 
---
If anyone on that server has done the event it's 100 , you don't have to do it yourself
---
PEOPLE. Why are you asking for such a convoluted way to substitute dirty water with purified water? Just add 1 recipe that turns purified water into boiled water. 
---
Yup pretty common, was at WhiteSprings and had invisible ghouls chasing me, ran to the gates where the bots are and they started shooting at them and killed them .. haven't had them of late, but I think it still happens now and then, pretty annoying, you can't even kill them either or least I have tried and haven't been able to.
---
Never mind, found it!
---
I think they should have just advertised it more as fo4 online but new maps and new quests maybe idk I love the game very few complaints from me just looking forward to seeing what new things we will get in game
---
I don't know if you know but if you hit right on some items it goes through a bunch of different options.
---
I'm level 48, I can grind to it 👍
---
Yeah, found this out last week. Pretty cool, to bad they only have a couple around the map.
---
They could just make new character only servers.
---
If they actually had the capability to stop duping and cheating, while also adding tools for players to connect with each other in a meaningful way. 
---
I don't believe they will do either.
---
New vaults opening? Maybe we'll get some actual NPCS that arent robots or super mutants.
---
Exactly, like a number of cosmetic items in this game. You would think GTA 5 screwing up “stacking” clothing/accessories so bad would have taught a lesson to orher gaming companies, but nah.
---
Coming soon to the atomic shop
---
Part of the issue is that Bethesda evidently sees "challenging" enemies as just, make them bullet sponges.
---
Nothing in the game is ever a challenge, it's just "are you willing to expend the resources necessary to kill it?" 
---
I just settled here last week! Even though it doesn’t have any resource nodes, I think the location has a lot going for it. Tons of water, within walking distance to a vendor, and a very close (aka cheap) fast travel to White Springs and the Scorchqueen fissure site. Plus, incorporating the bridges into my build design was so much fun.
---
Part of the exploit is the sheer count of items overwhelming you. Even in morrowind you could force the game to make a container when you dropped too many items and threw the engine for a loop. They could force a fix by making any items over a certain count like 5k to fuse into a single unusable item (maybe Dross?) that becomes worthless. 
---
God I wish the weight perks worked on the stash.  I'd have probably 100lbs of space freed up from that if they did.
---
It’s just funny that besides the constant server disconnects the other main problem people have is the atom shop and its prices.....I have been playing video games since Pong and I don’t remember thinking that Mario need a new outfit or that solid snake needed a party hat. The only way to teach these greedy companies is not to buy this stuff.
---
First friends only mode
---
second friends only mode
---
third friends only mode
---
forth difficulty settings
---
it worked for the borderlands series
---
What level of rad resist makes a non-pa setup manageable? By manageable I mean with radaway and healing. X-01 has 513 rad resist, rad-x plus diluted rad-x gets you 300. Are there any food or chems that can push that higher?
---
Adding leaded to armor pieces as well, what's the highest you can get you rad resist?
---
boy you won't like the datamines if you're hoping for that
---
At least there would be something worth spending on in there if they did.
---
Conduits have 1 that has a pointy connection to put power too. From there run pipes to another pointy connector.  
---
Conduits are a good thought but bad design.
---
I'm playing fo76 like fallout 4 with three exceptions: I cant build an intricate economically viable settlement (self vendoring in fo4 was awesome), I cant hoard everything, I'm doing it coop.
---
Only the coop aspect is awesome and it makes me gloss over the bad. With fo76 we got a bad multiplayer fo4. We should have gotten a better fo4 with multiplayer instead. Shameful really.
---
I agree with all of these 
---
If it hasn’t been said already but I would also like others to see my camp on the map and charge a small traveling fee to use as a fast traveling point.
---
I don't feel compelled to put effort into building a base, I've spent a few hours already building a shell, but can't bring myself to finish the interior - there's just no actual point to it above the benches and a bed.
---
I'm playing rn. What's up? Where did you get this info? Platform?
---
It's fine. It just never even crossed my mind that I would have to store my junk. I only considered my storage to be for back-up guns, meds, etc. I just never thought to put my junk in there because I figured that PVP was easy to avoid if I wanted to, and I didn't consider the crashing bugs, etc.
---
Basically, I never would have expected to lose all my junk by dying and then disconnecting from the server. I shouldn't HAVE to be afraid of that happening.
---
Have you found any other cool spots you can build at that give you free stuff? 
---
I all ready told you. A lot of improvements have been made but not nearly enough. A lot of people can be killed in a shooting but there is still a lot of people left alive in the world. There only probably 1 tenth done with the bugs and ballences
---
Nope.
---
Anything you build is technically part of your CAMP (it can’t be otherwise really), so should move with anything else. 
---
If I remember correctly, its because Bethesda knew a bunch of people would want to launch a nuke for the new years, and they also knew white springs was a hot target. 
---
They had sent out a tweet asking people to take new years pictures at the white springs bar, and share them on Twitter, so to keep people from getting killed all day they shut them down. 
---
They should be back up tomorrow 
---
I'll usually help out any player who is powering one up and yeah, its hella confusing cycling between the three.
---
They should have pushed for adverts like it was ESO instead of them making it seem like the next iteration of a fallout game
---
I'm sure people are duping to prepare as we speak.
---
I mean, if they could have One-Shot you right back if they could have found you, then it isn't really that broken. It's just that he never got a hit on you. If you're both 50 or higher you should basically be equally as powerful, because that's the Soft Cap for Special. Everything after that is just re-speccing and finalizing your build.
---
Theoretically, if you can both One-Shot each other then it *is* balanced. Not balanced in a fun way, neither should be able to One-Shot the other at all, because it makes real battles impossible, but that's beside my point, which is that it's *technically* balanced if you can both do insane damage to each other.
---
The real question here is what would have happened if the high level player has hit you back? Because if they barely scratch you then yes, in that case it'd be totally out of balance (assuming Perks &amp; Gear are relatively equal).
---
Sorry if I'm speaking out of turn since I really don't PVP much, and so haven't experienced the 'imbalance' yet myself.
---
what you said has literally nothing to do with anything. people playing the game in new years want to, well, play the game. not go to some meet and greet no one will bother to show up to.
---
even worse because this time off work for some. so yeah, I'd say they're pretty out of touch.
---
this is moot anyhow, it's been confirmed not even Bethesda was aware the nukes aren't working. so yet another fuckup to their list.
---
I’d say 90% of dupers have crazy stash and carry weight, couldn’t this be a way of finding them? 
---
I was hoping that's how they would i.plement a respec. 
---
I see somebody commented, just to let you know fam you are shadowbanned
---
ok that makes sense, I don't do PVP or go to the blast zones, but I have heard stories about idiots shooting others. On that note, can these guys one shot us non pvp players if we don't shoot back, I had some douche bags attack my camp and start shooting it up, I play with two characters, so I made my camp disappear my logging off and one of them tried to kill me and couldn't. I saw him switching weapons and trying everything in his power to kill me but couldn't, I just kept healing myself which was hilarious and probably making him more mad, was funny. Just curious as I have heard of people dying even when in passive mode.
---
That would crash the servers
---
I went out and found a regular sledgehammer, and, yes, the mod was there in the menu.
---
In some respects it fixed the games... in some respects, would you call a “Hentai Waifu Nipple Mod” an improvement?
---
Not possible. They've admitted several times they have no tools for this sort of thing.
---
Nope. I’m a fan of the game. However the fun parameters are concise. Deserves one solid play through 
---
Razorgrain and corn. Good soup.
---
Yeah but then you would have low level players get griefed in Flatwoods until they quit the game. This would not work. Atleast with the current PvP set
---
That's not how it works.
---
Sure and that's all well and good for the gameplay but you know what's easier to kill than a cannibalistic mutant or radiation induced wasteland horror? A small table. 
---
I sort of adore the absurdity of it all. 
---
Does it have any environmental pros? Water or a resource you can exploit?
---
The grafton steel yard is good for addressing this, as well as the scrapper perk and picking up shitloads of dead guys’ guns. I usually collect enough steel using the Charleston junkyard and/or other workshop steel extractors. Thankfully steel is one of the quickest-extracted materials in the game, so take a couple workshops with those things and you’ll be swimming in it! I find super mutants and ammo boxes have more than enough gunpowder as well, I haven’t collected any in weeks and I still have 300+ of the shit that I need to use, just from having obsessively collected it at lower levels.
---
They expire every week
---
No, these games were good when they released. That's why they are still successful.
---
I don't care either way honestly but it would be in their best interest to have NPCs because that is most peoples biggest complaint.
---
pc, servers just went down for maintenance.
---
Yes, the artillery has the ability to be powered and fired.
---
I don't get how what someone else is doing effects your ability to "role-play" a trader...?
---
Don't get me wrong anyone cheating / duping imo should be banned, it seems to me though your just being selfish though and thinking more about the caps that you THINK your going to miss out on.
---
Run your own race and don't worry so much about what every one else is doing and I'm sure you'll enjoy your roleplay more!
---
It would be better then the tents you can't place anywhere without at least one corner magically floating. 
---
Buy em a drink first
---
The link has expired. May i get an invite? Thanks!
---
You probably already know this, but Morgantown High School is a great source of plastic. Tons of plastic pumpkin heads, plastic plates and forks and knives.
---
Well, there’s no 'actual' point to anything, really. I just happen to enjoy building. Especially incorporating existing structures into new builds.
---
Not really, no. There's a copper vein nearby. It's close to ammo factory which is why I had it for a bit.
---
Yeah but it should be Luck since the chances are already tied to luck.
---
NOTHING IS REAL
---
Carhenge is a yearly visit for me when I go out to Scottsbluff. Fun times!
---
Those are optional. The ones that fix the game fixed my game. 
---
Wow, that's lame of them to patch it on New Years day .. they sure going to be told off, not cool Bethesda
---
If it’s working I’ll come kill her. 
---
YES! I don’t play WoW, but we should have something like their trading system. With places on the map that you can go to and scroll through items put up for sale by other players.
---
You do you :)
---
Try and have more weapons on you and as much junk as you can in your stash box. If you find yourself being wanted. 
---
No scorchbeasts. Lord be praised.
---
What?! A bug?!? Nooooo...in fallout 76?!?!?? You sir are a liar 
---
They'll crash their own markets.
---
Or the servers.
---
Power Armor.  
---
Hazmat.  
---
A group to share Rad Sponge.  
---
Bug it out.  
---
Those are your options.
---
Go to Flatwoods and check the vendor bot. If no bat plans, quit and reload and try again. 
---
Does anyone know where I can find one of these? The wikis don't say where they drop, what they drop from, or where the plans are. Can someone please help me out?
---
I just quit the game of my own accord a minute ago, it was still fine for me with no mention of maintenance on the main menu
---
Don’t be sensible, it’ll get you downvoted 
---
&gt;i"m on PC and playing still. Server hopping without issues even.
---
If I managed to get that many hours out of a game I'd say it's a positive. If you've played a game for 200 hours I'd start you got your 40-80 dollars worth (depending when you bought it. Maybe you didn't feel entirely immersed but that didn't stop you from continuing for a couple hundred hours. 
---
Srsly.
---
Yup, mostly on PC. Tried it on PS4 too, but I only can hook it up by wifi and had some really nasty lag issues in every game lately.
---
Darn it!
---
Adrenaline and Bloody Mess are really helpful when using a a LBB/Flame Saw.  
---
I haven't found perks like slugger help or Martial or whichever its called.  
---
Waiting to get the next level of WA to try things again, but oh man so fun to run through whitesprings with the saw dicing everything.
---
Now , if they can only make the game into a worthwhile endeavour rather than a broken cluster**** they'll be golden. Sarcasm aside,  how DID 76 launch like this? Aren't there quality testers or something?
---
Ofc
---
https://discord.gg/6hA2tjk
---
Invite some friends as well.
---
Seems to work just fine for me. I use a USB cable with my controller.
---
Yea how? 
---
Yeah even a neat idea silly scene to check out would be cool. Like in the satellite dish a gathering of Jangles the moon monkey lol
---
&gt;people playing the game in new years want to, well, play the game. not go to some meet and greet no one will bother to show up to.
---
Yeesh have you literally never played any mmo style games? People do this all the time.
---
I wonder how many people will just use this feature for more storage. Like, list your stuff for the highest possible price so no one buys it and you've just added more slots to your stash.
---
Yeah, bad/laggy/bugged games being released is one thing. But the communication of this whole shitfest has been super poor which even if you can forgive bugs/faults is something that can't be forgiven.
---
So do I did you have to configure anything ?
---
Correct.
---
No.  I play with friends and I don't care what you dupe.  Leave me alone
---
can't wait to see what coming.

I know this isn't perfect but what if they made the accounts with the mass duped items permanently wanted for a while while stripping them of all items and making it an event almost where we the masses can light the torches and flaming pitchforks and go on a man hunt after them in reward for caps or something I know they could just not play for a while but I think it would be fun watching everyone after them seeking our own justice.
---
No one really cares what you find acceptable or not. It's been the holidays and people deserve to spend time with family.
---
I couldn't remember what set it was on, but yeah
---
whatever button is bound to "inspect", default X
---
&gt;you could engage in PvP knowing that if you got beat it was legit. Allowing dupers to exist deters people from engaging in PvP.
---
and why exactly is that a concern? explosive weapons are a thing with or without duping.
---
you need to know the other guy farmed for months otherwise you'd feel cheated? sounds like salt to me either way.
---
&gt;in a PVE setting when a guy is running around one shotting shit before anyone else can tag it, it messes with you getting loot and experience.
---
and that is my problem, why? go farm your own shit. not to mention there are melee/explosive builds that can kill almost as effectively in one hit.
---
There isn't one. That's the issue 
---
Mm, players will probably have to stumble upon player vending machines at their camps. How often will you see camps close by each other enough that you think "I better go back and pick stims up from this guy's vending machine instead?" Sure, there will be popular store spots but I hardly ever run into someone's CAMP, especially multiple in the same session.
---
If you take it to its logical extension, if some traders dupe and flood the market with an infinite amount of all items, the prices will drop and the majority of players will already have acquired the majority of items, leaving non-duping traders with nothing to sell because of lack of demand.
---
But is it a higher chance than other events is what I am asking. 
---
Was wondering if it was like the Penitentiary escort quest that always gives a random weapon plan. 
---
I have mainly been focusing on the events:  Uranimum fever, AWOL, and One violent night to farm legendaries, but would add in those others if they had a better chance for PA plans.  
---
That’d be why :) 
---

This might help, its a small channel on youtube called decoy's dungeons. He did a vid on a good amount of locations with double resources.
---
again, that's their problem.
---
Helpful Tip: 
---
If you're on PS4, you can use the PSN to message other Players. This seems really tedious at first, because switching to the menu and 'typing' with the on screen keyboard is honestly horrendous, and terribly set up.
---
BUT there's a phone app you called PlayStation Messaging that lets you do it from your cell! Seriously changed my experience, because now I can just grab my phone, tap a message out way quicker, and not have to stand blindly in the wasteland afraid I'll be attacked or whatever while I'm in the PS menu.
---
Tl;dr PlayStation Messaging app is a good substitute
---
I believe some in the nucleaf siles are lvl 3.
---
The thing is, nobody is going to buy from him, when they have a duper selling overpowered items at a reduced price because they can literally make hundreds.
---
I've been playing for the past few hours. Servers still seem to be running.
---
Well, Bethesda should create a way to report players in game for specific reasons ("Report player&gt;exploiting&gt;duping") and if a player has 3 reports then I'm sure Bethesda is at the very least capable of telling what is in a person's inventory if they look at their individual account. It might be more time consuming than they would like, but it could work.
---
I don't truly know what is feasible, but I do know what I would like happen
---
As i have said here and even had an insane amount of community support for.
---
Their effect on server stability , pvp , player market and just their balant disrespect for the community deserve them losing their entire Bethesda account. 
---
A someone who takes a huge part in the player market as a trader. Their practice had had a major effect on us. When they dupe 1.2 tonnes worth of items and destroy the market. Making only certain items worth buying and the rest worth almost nothing. While they drive other prices to silly amounts 100 caps for a serum is not worth the trouble to even make it for us.
---
Does not effect them when they have 100s and 1000s of Nuka Colas giving them unlimited caps....
---
Better not rant to much otherwise i will end up repeating my entire thread just click and read.
---
Oh man, this game really needs more quests too. That's probably the biggest disappointing thing that stood out to me, how quickly I finished all the quests in this game. And the events/dailies are also like a worse, more limited version of the radiant quests that appeared in previous games.
---
Yes, I do have unstable isotope! So that’s what that is....
---
No. I just plugged it in. There might be some option for controller, but I never had to look for it.
---
Just use your water pump. Drink once then immediately spam collect. You can get around 10 dirty water for each drink. Life saver when I found this out
---
Sounds like Emily Hampshire to me from 12 monkeys

---
Is it the wired 360 controller? If so, i just plugged it in and win10 installed the drivers.
---
I have. enough to know that Fo76 isn't a mmo.
---
and I have played enough of 76 to know there's not enough people who would bother to show up. AND that the playerbase wants to nuke Whitesprings, not hang around it.
---
Here is a demo of my workshop.

---
The codes are changed weekly for all three silos, usually the new codes can be found online again within a day or so..
---
Na. I think storing would work just the same.
---
Yes it creats a small exlotion around you lower health enemies get hit hadest againt it it doesnt do to much to high lvl enemies 
---
Xbox 1 controller and it's wired. 
---
I am on XBOX no issues.
---
You’re right, the players are to blame for this company failing at developing a game. 
---
This sounds insanely funny i would be ok with this.
---
*hmm*
---
Well I’m almost positive they can track who was duping and who received duped items to ban the people that matter.
---
You could have just said that instead of accusing me in a roundabout way of duping.
---
Yeah, so far Fallout 76 is pretty good at avoiding the sort of fear of missing out effect that nearly every other online game has. Except for atom shop stuff, but that stuff is so overpriced that I know I'm not even going to have a chance at it all so I don't care about it at all.
---
Plans for all the power armors can be found and you can craft higher level versions.  The t-51b has the best stats at lv 50
---
Why can't you find a place where our CAMP can be placed THEN put us in the world?
---
Ok. This is super helpful. Thanks very much
---
Player vending is coming soon according to Bethesda
---
https://bethesda.net/en/article/5te3GDsV1eOM2YOKoyWoI6/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-1-2019
---
If u have PA, jump inside, that Will unstuck you
---
Agreee. Duping is a huge problem for longevity of the game, and theres no healthy player economy if the duping continues. I wish this would be priority.
---
Stop comparing rad resist number in PA/rad suit and elsewhere. They’re not comparable. There was a big thread here that demonstrated it. 
---
1000RR in PA makes you nearly radproof. 
---
3000RR from rad-x’s etc doesn’t. 
---
What you should be asking is “using RR from armor pieces, armor legendary effects. Rad resistant perk and chems, how far do I need to go to manage a nuke zone?”
---
I don’t know. Yet. 
---
This. Bethesda does not care about communication enough to give you what you expect from your money.
---
Almost like someone thinks launching a nuke on your own land might not be a great idea? But that’d be ridiculous 
---
I third this.
---
Take over Public Workbenches and defend them at least once (a defend quest will usually start a few minutes after a take over). It’s pretty easy and you get lots of Chen’s as part of you reward.
---
I dont know. What does the fox say?
---
I didn't have any drivers install I don't think 
---
Power Plant Workshops have shortcut with lvl 3 hacker
---
It's just that the handmade plan is one of many weapons plans.  You could get lucky and get it on the 1st/2nd try, or like me, nothing after 10+ tries, which is brutal for a 20min-long quest.  I ended up creating an alt, leveling him up to 15 and got it done in a day.  
---
To be real, nothing has changed since before the holidays, or since launch. There was a sort-of promise of more transparency and the best we've gotten are extremely vague weekly  blogs with no specifics, and seemingly no inclination towards accountability.
---
I know. But the Industrial Farm is powered by Poseidon.
---
Looks like some interesting stuff is coming, can't wait for them to elaborate on it in the next one or two inside the vaults.
---
Main issues for me.
---
Menu for friendlist and groups is too overcomplicated. I got three group invites. Used the keycombination prompted on my screen and nothing happened.
---
Then we need the ability to create permanent groups. For this each server instance need to have more than 24 players on it.
---
Then we need automated machines to sell stuff. Because finding other players and selling stuff doesn't work. (I tried hard to make a trade work but there wasn't any option displayed to seal a deal or make a clear offer).
---
That’s crazy. I’ve been playing since beta and have o lay ever seen 2 nukes in whitespring and 2 nukes at fissure prime. I must have bad nuke luck. 
---
Is it, really? I mean, people are complaining about the bugs and stuff, but only a few are complaining about lack of NPCs (which is a design choice, and in my eyes its a great one).
---
I for one love that there arent any NPCs (fallout npcs tend to be annoying anyway) and it makes... sense in the world they built to not have NPCs.
---
I think it has to do with not having enough room for the animation.  Try moving your Power Armor crafting station to an area with more space (away from walls,  etc.)
---
This is literally the worst possible answer. They partially made a bad game without any of the tools they would need to manage it. 
---
A forgivable error would be that there was a duping exploit. An unforgivable error is not having any way to know what is happening in their broken game. 
---
Duh.....it counts as scrap thats why it lists the scrap it is
---
they better not be nerfing anything else. the game feels like a chore at times as it is.
---
Is it only during your current session or is it everytime you log in? personally never had that issue.
---
No
---
Have you been in a nuke zone farming when someone has a TSE? It’s pretty much impossible.
---
Antique shop east of watoga has one
---
Enemies with stars next to their names, normally has "legendary" in there too.
---
High level mobs like Mirelurk queens, Behemoths, etc, have a chance as well.
---
We knew no NPCs since original announcement, right? Dunno how it could be a complaint when we knew what this was gonna be. Plus it made exploring the Whitespring for the first time sorta... special
---
I mean, even without Bandolier, 3000 of most common ballistic ammo is only slightly over 10.
---
Happens every time. I’ve joined multiple sessions
---
Yes they are, seeing as they’re filling the servers beyond capacity with items.
---
Add me theangry husky. All i do is explore and events. 
---
Volume? Did you see the post where a character literally turned into the protagonist from fo4? Lol
---
In my community we use discord overlay too. Here how we make it. No need to alt tab or to have other monitors with this method : https://bethesda.net/community/topic/242144/discord-overlay-chat-an-alternative-to-in-game-text-chat
---
The real flaw is : it work only with people you already have on a discord server or discord friends. 
---
I usually farm the low level mutants for gunpowder. I just wish there was a more efficient way. I avoid workshops because I keep getting griefed by trolling players whenever I grab one, bad luck I guess.
---
Biggest issue is a full stash and not being able to vendor bulked surplus because of cap limits.
---
Ooops my bad! 
---
H Y P E
---
Between top of the world and the ski resort 
---
It should just work.... no pun intended, lol. 
---
Oh yeah! Poseidon! 
---
This is great news! I've been wondering what they've been working on.
---
Not sure about those, but Grafton Steel has 2 steel resourcers already built, they just need power.
---
Lol it doesn't idk why every game I've tested does but it just doesn't respond with controllers. It's odd.
---
Flatwoods itself is, nearby places outside of the tutorial path don't seem to be.
---
You can craft and scrap your own weapons and armor to learn mods.
---
I have a foot locker plan if Ya want it....700 Caps is what I bought for from vendor 
---
Grafton Dam outside door in the compound is lvl3 terminal or Bobby pins I believe.
---
Faction C. A. M. P.   A way to wire the camp devices together for increased budget but lose of mobility. Or something to that effect
---
A patch later this month? Content coming this year? Wow lol.
---
If you haven't already found the answer, it's most likely a coding issue. The holotape shows 9999 days, which suggests a date function is returning a bad value. For instance, trying to subtract 12/31/2018 from 1/1/2018. Obviously no one knows exactly what's wrong, but it's probably coding. 
---
I come across lvl 3 locks way more often than terminals.  I've debated on getting master hacker, I may wait till after 60 to grab it.  As it is I leave picklock 1&amp;2 on all the time (don't have enough perks to warrant taking them off right now) but swap out hacking all the time.
---
Nade and pray! 
---
Honestly just drop some of the lower-value bulk, it’s not worth the weight or the caps especially if it’s being that much of a hamper. I still try and keep mine below 400, just because I got real close to 600 a bit ago and didn’t want to have to juggle shit while overencumbered.
---
Should just be plug and play.
---

---
I had an instigating explosive combat rifle and lost it in a crash. Only one of 2 legendaries I’ve gotten (other is a garbage 3* Gauss)
---
Oh but it does make a HUGe difference wether you get there in 2 or 6 months. 
---
I am fully confident there is more coming. I would say the current amount of content was designed to last the “Average” player 200 hours over a 6 month period in which by that time there will be more content. 
---
This is exactly how every other MMO type game is. It’s the people who rush through the content in the first few weeks who complain about there not being enough. 
---
Destiny 1 and 2 were this way. No end game content at first. Just the same events over and over grinding our gear to up your light level. Took them a few months to add raids and more content. 
---
I played WOW for THOUSANDS of hours over 6+ years. I can still remember on Expansion launches (Burning Crusade, WOTLK, etc) there would be people who reached max level again in less than 24 hours.  Then they had nothing to do but the same instances over and over and the one raid that was released. It was always at least 3-4 months before new raid content was released. 
---
I expect the same with FO76. For crying out loud, give BGS 3-4 months to get the new content out. They have already communicated some big things for Jan release. 
---
I doubt that. That would require them to store data on who has what, when and how it was acquired, and have digital footprints for each item that log which players traded it and to whom. None of that data was collected, so they won’t be able to do anything about the duping that was done previously. Those items are in the economy now, they won’t be able to distinguish them from fairly acquired items.
---
Just when you think Bugthesda can't fuck up anymore - they put down their beer and run through the street naked with their pubes on fire lol
---
Concrete is fairly common, one you start to know where to find it (keep a note of where you find the bags, they'll resplendent after a day or two). But if you’re running short of wood just fast travel for free to Vault 76 and go south, there’s loads of fallen trees in the Forest and all of them can be harvested for wood, you don’t need to harvest cut logs and wood piles, any large piece of wood on the ground or tree stump can be harvested.
---
"I've gone wanted a few times out of boredom or desperate need for screw"
---
Such a true rendition of the human condition.
---
not when they fuck up this bad, no. and there are lots of companies out there working through the holidays.
---
Yeah, you're right. I also have to drop tons of legendaries from nuke zone runs. The whole having to drop stuff in a game about collecting junk is just something I have trouble coming to terms with.
---
maybe it's not because he's trying to be cool, but because &gt;thatsthejoke.jpg is a common post, though only on 4chan, where every post and reply has a picture, so it makes sense. Redditors picked it up because they want that sweet meme juice. plebbitors btfo once again
---
looks nice
---
I've been spending the last few days trying to help out lower level players. It's probably the most satisfying thing about this game. Only problem is the spawns tend to be higher level when I'm around, so I need to act pretty quick after they tag the mobs so they don't get themselves killed. 
---
If you like exploration, you might be interested in tour and look at other player's camp? Assuming they don't shoot at the first sight, that is.
---
The reason I state they are either bugged or unfinished is because they are supposed to power up nearby areas when the connected power plant had been repaired. They only sometimes do this. 
---
I was able to get the fusion generator from "powering up monongah". That thing is awesome! 
---
They’ve heard us, they have people monitoring this sub, they have added stuff we’ve asked for, they know they’re in the shitter with their community, that’s why they WILL LISTEN
---
servers are still up, so I'm not sure what that person is talking about
---
Ah, this makes sense. Thanks!
---
I just want to know what pistol you were using. 
---
Yes, at the substations themselves actually. But they don't always work, and sometimes when the substation itself has been powered up it still doesn't power up the nearby facilities. 
---
You’re right, there’s no reason why the game creators should have to handle this. 
---
Thank You kind sir or madam
---
Try different usb port? 
---
Just checked on my PC. If i have controller plugged in when starting the game it works, if i start without it plugged in, boot the game and plug in afterwards it also work.
---
Same here, I can’t stand it. I loved throwing up decorations and collecting unique weapons in fallout 3 and NV, 4 was a bit sketchier in terms of that, and then this game just fucked all that.
---
Its not a complaint like I said I dont care either way its just a suggestion for getting more people into the game. I'm already playing and I'm not stopping just because there's no NPCs.
---
I would argue this game was good on release. I have had a ton of fun. Dropped RDR2 like cold turkey as soon as FO76 came out.  We’re there bugs? Sure, but that didn’t stop me from enjoying the game. 
---
I have basically played 2 games for an entire year, PUBG and FO76.  Can’t get enough of either. 
---
It’s happened to me a lot. Try just restarting your game and see if that works.
---
This is why I always just turn around and use the PA Stations directly behind me whenever I buy a mod from the Enclave.
---
What benefit do the dupers gain from doing this? If they duped caps they are already at max cap limit, so selling duped items via vendor would only continue to keep them at max caps right?   
---
Or is the problem that they would sell the best weapons cheap so that everyone has their perfect weapon and doesn't need to shop around any more? 
---
Coming December 2019 for all we know
---
I can’t play with people on Xbox?! 
---
Funnel Cakes Rule!
---
Yeah and then there’s the issue of experience not being shared so I feel bad one shotting enemies and them not get xp
---
Why can’t they just share xp with your party? Isn’t partying up the whole point of this game?
---
Same with the Gourmand quest. I had the cannibal perk so I tucked into some tasty ghoul. She sounded equally impressed and disgusted. 
---
Yup another "big update" like how they've talked about nearly every other update we've gotten. No specifics about upcoming features, and no apology/accountability for screw ups. 
---
Still gave to find a way of tracking those accounts down, which Bethesda can't right now. 
---
SWG vendors all over again.
---
**LOADSAMONEY**
---
Oh and to ruin people’s fun and crash the economy.
---
Hm.. I'll try but it's wierd everything else works I might have to reinstall it 
---
It’s not been finished because they couldn’t give a shit about save the world..while they are the owners of the golden goose.
---
They do,that’s how their engine works, that’s why they only increased stash limit by 200 because every single little thing is recorded
---
What should they be telling us? They already named bugs to be fixed in this patch in the LAST into the vault just before the new year. People wanna complain that there’s no updates and they don’t even bother reading them 
---
Can anyone please tell me (without spoiling their contents) which vaults are already accessible in Fallout 76? I have only discovered Vault 94 so far and I'd like to know if I should keep looking for the password or if it's for future content only.
---
On another note, thanks for posting this; I hadn't read it yet!
---
Thank you :)
---
A softer option would be to fix the game balance so that explosive isn't an automatic choice. They'd need to fix duping first though, and that may not be easy.
---
On r/me_irl u/beefy_cabbage made a meme saying the British queen was going to die on January 5th. Soon after an account named u/ImNotMI6 made posts acting like a fellow memester asking for info on location of his “friend” beefy cabbage.  ImNotMI6 is still very determined to find his “friend”
---
the overseer see was a badass
---
No one ever said that Bethesda isn't at fault for having a buggy game. 
---
Just like every single time an exploit is available in a game, the developer is the root cause.
---
But just like every other game, there is a user agreement/terms of service that states that cheating and exploiting is against the rules. What happens in those games? The players are punished or banned.
---
We have already made it VERY CLEAR to Bethesda that duping needs to be fixed, and they know this. However, we need to also make sure that the people who are actively trying to break the game/ruin the experience for others are dealt with accordingly. And along with them, the damage they have already done should be removed from the game as well. 
---
You need to make it so you can use the search function. 
---
I’m not sure rn, but with mods getting scrapped if you got no steel. Does that happen also when you’re trying to repair a weapon without having enough steel? Maybe they could make it work in a similar fashion to mods/steel, if you have no boiled water, it uses purified.
---
Any zoo is a petting zoo when you’re not a little bitch. 😂
---
I've tried it all.  It looks like I'm gonna be stuck with this bugged quest forever.
---
I have fortune finder. It’s a blessing and a curse, some of those stashes are damned hard to find, even when you can hear them. I've sometimes spent ages trying to track one down.
---
any event that has the word 'enclave' in it, or just kill starred legendaries in a high leg area like whitespring
---
I’d have liked if it was more detailed but I’m glad we got something in the way of a heads up. 
---
Looking forward to seeing how they do player vending 
---
Agreeing as well. I sit 7-10 feet away from a 30" QHD monitor and it is still a struggle sometimes.
---
Well, I finally found someone I agree with about this kinda thing, so whatever lol. I'm honestly so frustrated by the new Perk system. I *hate* having to constantly swap cards in and out whenever I want to craft something, or trade with a Vendor. It makes sense for a lot of the Perks, because it's what shapes and limits specific builds for combat, healing, group vs. solo play, etc., while offering the flexibility to change your build later on, or even slightly on the fly.
---
BUT I find it so *fricking tedious* to open my menu before and after every terminal I want to hack. And before and after all Crafting. And for almost every vendor interaction 🤦
---
And all they'd have to change is to make some of those Cards have a Cost of 0, and then they could just stay equipped without taking up space in a build. It's really that simple. Crafting &amp; Repair Perks should have a Special Cost of 0. Definitely Hard Bargain, Lock-Picking, and Hacker as well. Maybe even Scrapper and Cap Collector. Possibly the audio-alert perks for bobbles, mags, and cap stashs as well, though they're less important for most people I think.
---
Coming tomorrow morning for all we know.
---
I think you can legitimately claim you're done, yes. Once the quests are wrapped and the map is seen, it's time to either roll alts and try whacky builds, or play something else and wait for DLC.
---
There are 9 at Top of the World Skin resort. 
---
Shhhh, it’s my favorite place to Server hop to farm lead/steel for ammo. Much better than taking the munitions factory when combined with super duper and ammosmith. 
---
Or its Todd ;)
---
Puff piece by there PR team probably :/
---
Disappointing that Bethesda continues to treat paying customers this way...proper communication, open and honest these were just a few words that were banded around by them after there disastrous launch and now were back to the same crap :(
---
Patches and fixes take time yes i get that and will patiently wait for them and have faith however, dupers, game breaking bugs and servers as fragile as these are things that should be getting fixed like yesterday, especially after the terrible launch. 
---
Waiting weeks for actually substantial communication about the terrible state of the game and this is what we get?
---
What time can we expect the latest game breaking bug to be fixed at Bethesda? What time can I go and launch another nuke at or attempt to take out the SQB again? Gonna have an answer for us or do we have to wait a couple more weeks whilst you go radio silent about your inability to get a grip and fix your mistakes?
---
Whoa, what do I need for this?
---
&gt; A lot of improvements have been made but not nearly enough.
---
Woah hold on sounds like you're making a circlejerk criticism post. It's still a bad game? Can you just shut up and let people enjoy it?
---
You say that like they don't delight in ruining the game. Mark my words when Bethesda acts it's gonna be fire and brimstone likely. I imagine something like "Duped Items cannot be scrapped or dropped without a help request ticket."  
---
which helps them identify, isolate and ban accounts that have an absurd # of items. Plenty of players likely have 1 or two items but only a few will have hundreds of hundreds.
---
I've searched the asylum a few times and haven't found the room you speak of. There is a room with nothing is real on the wall but no coffin or missing floor. This is the fort defiance asylum I'm looking in, if that's the one you are mentioning
---
Its only in instances where the mod represents the remainder of that material.
---
Ie: you have no scrap steel, only a mod worth 2 steel upon scrapping. Not knowing this you make bullets with the last two steel in your inventory and poof, good bye kinectic servos.
---
The game will show you the number of each of type of scrap  in the build menu so you can easily scrap a mod you've been hanging on to.
---
Hasnt happened to me but be aware that it can!
---
Probably going to be something that limits how much can be sold. Existing vendors have cap limits and the stash has a limit, I see a combination of the two limiting how big a player store can be.
---
FACTS
---
Most people do blame Todd
---
Your word on that is good enough for me. It concurs with everything else ive seen. 
---
That would be fair
---
The best you can do for now is share Inspirational.
---
They went back and elaborated on the Dec 6th patch on things they changed but omitted from the notes originally.  So they have increased their transparency some, time will tell on future patches.  I attribute the reduced communication due to the holiday season, and it doesn't bother me.  Bethesda's employees disserve to spend time with their families too.  
---
I will say this, launching an online game this time of year is not that good of an idea from a support (patches etc...) standpoint.  From a sales standpoint though, it gets the player base too balloon rapidly.
---
did you even read the post? https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/abis05/have_they_broken_nukes_y2k/ed0m9rf/
---
Servers reset throughout the day, if it wasn’t shared by Bethesda then there isn’t an update or maintenance. 
---
Might help, im out of ideas really. 
---
I despise cheating and cheaters more than the next guy, but why would a guy that plays 8 hours a week try to be a player vendor? 
---
Seems kind of like wanting to be a professional boxer but only training one weekend a month. Will you be asking for "balancing" concessions between you and players with more play time next?
---
Where’s the other 3? I know about the 3 on the first door to the left and the 3 in the back you have to jump for.
---
The only game they'll ruin is their own.
---
No no. You can’t come on this sub with actual criticism.  The game is perfect despite not being finished. It’s worth full price despite being severely discounted for any suckers willing to buy it after release. It’s ideal for PC despite being made for consoles and missing many standard PC features. 
---
List of known issues, an actual content timeline, support system that can actually support players. Alot of games have support agents on their game's subreddit or forum to answer to all of this negative feedback or questions. Including f2p games.
---
explosive isn't op by itself. I tried an explosive auto laser and it'd shave off less than 1% of a high level super mutant.
---
keep in mind base explosive damage is flat instead of scaling with the weapon's base damage. so it's the same for every other weapon.
---
Don't know why you've been downvoted, but you're correct.  It's well-known and documented that they don't even have the tools to restore lost quest items or other things.
---
Frankly, if they could figure out who had duped what, they would've banned people following the initial widely-used artillery dupe, but they didn't.  Because they can't.
---
I would love to be proven wrong by their actions in the coming weeks, but I know better.
---
Holy shit. I’m moving my camp lol.
---
Gotta be careful. Early on i set up camp next to a substation and had to move, because everytime i came back there,the substation was filled with Scorched who liked to shoot me. Bit awkward when i was travelling back to camp to get rested because I was nearly dead already from another encounter elsewhere. 
---
That's a good idea too. I like your thinking
---
I'd love to see an actual source from all of you claiming the game is "hemorrhaging" players. You quitting doesn't at all meant that most people are or will. If you're going to try to reference all the people on the internet saying they'll quit, that's not a source or really reliable in any way. Same with the "ratings" on various gaming websites. I've seen too many people that bitch about the game while admitting they've never played it to take any of that remotely serious. 
---
I don't really give a shit about dupers, although I would take satisfaction in watching the cheaters get banned. Other than the water purifier thing are there really that many game-breaking bugs left? I know the servers can be unstable but they're a hell of a lot better than they used to be. Hell, I almost never get dc'd these days. 
---
Black cowboy hat, prisoner collar, wedding ring and hunter longcoat. 
---
Fix the game first before you worry about dupers. Actually put in a patch that gets rid of the duping method instead of doing nothing. That change to make it so you can craft only 255 items did nothing. Actually fix the game first before you witch hunt.
---
They actually don't, that's the issue. They have no tools to view or modify anyone's character.
---
What a stupid comment, not even worth the time to properly reply to but just ask yourself. If your consumers stop buying and playing your crap, who's more important then the consumer or the shareholder?
---
I don't have very many bad things to say about this game...But this is one of them. If I want to play enforcer for someone they other person should benefit from it in some way, xp wise. Either that or the spawns should be closer to the low level player so they at least stand a chance without me having to one shot the mob before the mob one shots them.
---
Ghoulish + RAD sponge sharing team 
---
All of the vaults (besides 76) are for future content and generally are not accessible yet. 
---
Oh so when you do try to farm whitesprings after a wile and a person has a TSE and is stealing all your kills what will be the gripe then??? 
---
That’s why a wipe doesn’t make sense to me, it doesn’t fix the root problem as in removing insanely OP weapons in the first place.  The only weapons that should kill like that are grenades and misses.
---
Might want to re-apply some thermal paste and see if that is the problem.
---
Spec of the cooler and which cpu do you have?
---
Is your rad or heat sink CLEAN?
---
76c is also not bad. But come summer, turn on the AC.
---
What i mean is one you can have at a workshop/CAMP
---
At late game they drop all the time from Scorched. Lowest level it can be acquired is around level 25 I believe.
---
Fallout 76 runs fine on Xbox One X and PS4 Pro though, it even runs good in 4k.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9aLks0YUO4
---
Expecting it to run on a 5 year old console and a brand new console is the issue, they can't make a different game for the Xbox One and the Xbox One X.
---
If you can't understand that, don't even reply because I'm tired of explaining it to you.
---
People who lose their gear or have their character screwed up in some way by a glitch are out of luck because bethesda is not capable of doing anything to their characters. I don't see how they would be able to track and remove duped items but not be able to help people who were the victims of gamebreaking bugs
---
Normally, sure, but it's been the middle of the holidays, dude. calm the fuck down.
---
What is your point i think you're doing this because you want the last word. Is that it because you understand the point i'm trying to make. Is that it?
---
I have a furious baseball bat that I know for fact after a few hits you can see the damage increase each time but it already did a pretty good amount of damage to begin with Because of my slugger build so I'm thinking it might not be a huge percent but when my number is so large it's able to add more where if you're testing it with a board that already doesn't deal much damage it probably doesn't increase much but Don't quote me that's just my opinion I definitely see it increase though so I know it's not broken.
---
I completely agree with everything you said as well as your thread
---
Personally I like to let the TSE guys shoot me accidentally by standing in the way, tap back and start PvP with glowing ones cheering us on, it’s glorious! 
---
&gt;I have. enough to know that Fo76 isn't a mmo.
---
I didn't say mmo, I said mmo style games.
---
Fallout 76 is an mmo lite. Players take time out from grinding to do shit like this all the time on plenty of games.
---
Im gonna do that because for whatever reason it's not even showing up when I add the game to the library it only shows up in bnet
---
No idea im laid off for winter so im on 12 hours a day hahaha
---
Ok. Thanks mate!
---
Except we know that bethesda either:
---
Can’t figure out who is doing it. 
---
Doesn’t care.  
---
Can't do that, they said no in game advantages from the atom shop, only cosmetics.
---
Weird. It did disappear once for me but came back a couple of days later in another group. 
---
It would have been mentioned that it is included in the patch coming later this month.
---
Whats in surgar grove
---
Plans. 
---
They can only Dupe what they have.
---
I was having this problem and had to move my station away from a wall in my camp. I dislike the location, gonna have to move it.
---
You're welcome!
---
Play something else for a while.  It'll still be here.
---
Fusion cores recharge to 100% if you log out in your PA. You really only need to carry 2-3 at most.
---
It doesn’t seem that that’s the issue because I even used ones at red rocket and those didn’t even work. Sometimes I get an alert that says “waiting for server response” but I still don’t know.
---
Events are like public quests that anyone can join, and you do get decent rewards for them. And yes, new content is coming as well.
---
Now that I have the excavator and can loot like mad, I’m going to farm them more often. I’m putting off endgame stuff. 
---
I guess you're right because it was one heck of a party last night.
---
oh, wait.
---
regardless, like I said, it's moot. Bethesda fucked up yet again. that's about it.
---
*two handed melee.... The one hand melee is super weak, unless you get instigating, or increased power attack dmg. 
---
I get that server drops are a thing, and they're probably difficult to resolve.  Really the biggest issue I have with disconnections is not that they happen, but that I *lose all my shit* when they do.  I just had a great base built at Charleston Landfill- I had extractors for aluminum and steel and copper set up, plus the large water pump.  And since the servers managed to stay up long enough for me to finally complete a Powering Up mission without crashing, I had finally gotten the fusion generator plans, so my base was bedecked with missile turrets.  The place was so well laid out that when a group of super mutants attacked, by defenses finished them off before I could even get in position and do any shooting myself.  
---
Then I got dropped a few minutes ago.  So I logged back in and ran back into the landfill to find the remains of some other player's base there.  A lot of stuff was already built but was badly (IMO) laid out, and since I didn't have any aluminum on me, I couldn't rebuild my generator.  And what the fuck, why is it the first workshop defense attack now suddenly seems to occur within ***seconds*** of taking over the workshop?  Am I the only one seeing this?  I barely have time to build anything before the first wave occurs.  
---
It wouldn't be so bad if I could log back in with X minutes (say 5-10?) and find my same workshop still there.  Yesterday I got disconnected within less than a minute of claiming the workshop, so there's like 30-40 caps down the drain.  Making the servers more stable would be great, but honestly the bigger priority needs to be logging me back into the same one I was dropped from so all my progress isn't lost.  
---
Maybe even just make it so all Emotes down inside your Camp show up for you if you're outside Camp? That way if you're in it you won't be spammed by other people there, but while you're away people can say thanks, or help, or use the trade emoji etc.
---
I can make everything but the Right Arm.
---
3* Gauss garbage??!! What 3 things does it have on it???
---
It's future content only. Other vaults out in the world are Vault 63 and Vault 97
---
not just me then, lost an X-01 leg to that bug.
---
I have a 4 star. It was a 3 star then I added a bleeding modification and it became 4 stars.
---
Just a thought but if you can tame a fox does it defend you camp and if it does does that mean I can have attack chickens ???
---
I don’t know a single dev that announces their plans and exactly when they’re going to implement them.
---
Sure. I'd like more daily/weekly stuff in general. Something like Complete 3 Event quests for 3star legendary item. 
---
NO KENT! Jury candy
---
I was spamming punji sticks around my turret platform to farm Whiterun at low levels and ran out of wood despite having an entire clubhouse full of tables, chairs, and bookcases. The ridiculousness is real.
---
I’d like to exchange ammo at the vending machines if we can’t sell directly to vendors, even if it’s scrip to just use at other vendors 
---
On PC. Sorry, forgot to mention that important detail lol 
---
Starting to wonder how indirectly you communicate with any of the development team.  Wiuld think you could have a real answer with a quick email or text.  They really can't stand the idea of getting close to us smelly peasants can they?
---
No I haven't, only been in them twice, have no real interest. To be honest I am just simply too busy with other stuff, this game is a full time job for me .. I just seem to have too much too do. I think I waste a lot of unnecessary time trying to complete my dailies, I don't have time to do anything else .. but I can understand the issue, I certainly have run into my share of dick bags .. which is probably no where near what you guys have in the nuke zones ..
---
Can’t you just hit the interaction button 100 times on water and then again on a cooling station and you’re set?
---
I don't understand why you're getting triggered already. Holidays or not, you usually find someone else to handle stuff things in the meantime.
---
The point of critique is to improve things, and fanboys especially should have the highest interest in that.
---
Where are pipes though?  That's what I'm saying... I don't see pipes under power connectors anywhere.
---
Are pipes a separate plan?
---
I love it when i QT in and they have just spawned like this, give em some molly's or Plasma nades!
---
Perfect idea. Having one at home would be awesome. 
---
Easier just to clear Blackwater mine and scrap everything in there including weapons 
---
They posted on Twitter saying they're aware of the situation and looking into it. That was a couple of hours ago.
---
Huh, yeah it doesn't run as well as you'd think for double the recommended specs for video memory. oh well
---
Xbox?
---
Not online but Bonus damage at less than 40% target health, faster fire rate and don’t remember the other. Damage was only like 140
---
Hawke's Refuge has a few
---
I will say I'm surprised at how little trolling and griefing there is in the game. I was expecting more, but I guess the pointless nature of it in the game and how unpopular it is has put away most of the trolls.
---
I've had a couple of people follow me around being annoying, and one person start shooting at my camp for no reason. That one I thought it was an accident at first. I was inside crafting when I heard something hit a wall and got notice I was under attack. I went outside and saw someone in the distance fighting some scorched. Figuring "Oh, they just hit my camp by accident, no big." Then they started lasering my turrets repeatedly. So... I just exited the game, and rejoined a new server. Attempted griefing thwarted and all they got was a bounty to their name. Woopee.
---
I know if you read some of the raider notes during the rose quests you find out that raiders had to do with Charlestown being washed away 
---
It only provided 10 energy
---
You really just sound like someone who came here to talk shit.
---
In all the lvl 3 locks I’ve pick I’ve never found loot worth the few seconds it took to pick the lock. I no longer even bother picking locks over lvl 0. It’s not worth the effort of moving perk cards around
---
Fallout 4 did
---
Actually last week's was empty save some photos. Two weeks ago we got this:   
---
" we will be releasing another patch that contains many fixes, including fixes for the Lever-Action Rifle reload animation, some perk cards, and we’re dealing some crowd control at the Whitespring by implementing a fix for the robots duplicating on the resort grounds **"**  
---
\[...\]
---
" We’re also hard at work on a new mode where you can work together, or not, without PVP restrictions. "  
---
That's it for details. And that was over a month post-launch. And a terrible launch at that.  From a billion dollar company.  
---
I'm not sure which games you're comparing this "transparency" to, but I've never played a game with a dev so quiet where they weren't abandoning the game without telling people. I don't think that's happening here, but they've got an insane PR nightmare on their hands and their public updates would only be appropriate for year two of a well-received and well-supported game.  
---
You dont need to fit all of them...just the roation of ones you selling.
---
Same thing happened to me but for my t-60 armor.  Purchased and put the mod in my stash, went to add the next day and it vanished. 
---
Fixing dupers may go a long way toward fixing the game.
---
And I just learned that only one can be active at a time. Tried to trigger Poseidon and couldn't figure out why it wasn't working until I looked at the map and saw one of the other plants was active.
---
It would be very fair. They are ruining the game. Weapons as strong as TSE weapons are supposed to be extremely rare. Duping and spreading them around dulls the content by making everyone obliterate everything. Low level players can't get hits in for xp within groups, high level players get burnt out because they literally one shot everything and there is no challenge, and on top of that duping ruins the in game economy amongst players. Oh yeah, and it also makes the server unstable. 
---
I have over a hundred but I rarely use them as a stealth sniper.
---
Plus I have healing factor 
---
yeah, I wouldn't be so sure. I play with explosives, not because they're op but because I fell in love with them in Fo4. and every single day there's some salty little bitch asking papa Todd to nerf them.
---
wouldn't be surprised if I logged one day and all my explosives were gone. that would honestly remove all incentive I have left to play this game.
---
Can add me on PC, IGN: direkiba
---
I always have stuff to drop or give and can help ya out, I am a nice level 182 not an asshat 
---
It’s instanced per player
---
Fixing duping doesn't magically get rid of duped stuff
---
The main annoying thing about duping is how much it crashes the servers 
---
Yeah, I had this near the abandoned bog town.  I was being pelted with snallygaster spit from a mob that I'd killed.  I had to log out to get it to stop (or, you know, die).
---
There's a problem right now where even using "place" won't protect it from other players WHILE it is in the power armor station.
---
Just worth being cautious.
---
out of arguments, dear?
---
Cool thanks, only thing I'm having problems with is the connection.  I have a good one, but the game freezes and drops a lot.  I'm on wired connection.
---
theangryhusky? i don’t think you can have spaces in psn names 
---
Wait they were down?
---
What did you do then? Did you contacted Bethesda? 
---
You didn't happen to do any crafting did you? Because if you run out of materials it'll take mods to meet the requirements of what your making
---
Make it so you can’t take an item out of the store once you offer it for sale, only change the price. 
---
I was doing feed the people and depositing the food while getting hit and it deposited my calibrated shocks too😤
---
More like 45, 😉 and thanks for the kind words. I try to help when I can!
---
Also
---
Using rad-x beats the purpose of the exercise because it temporarily switches off your mutations, costing you your x1.5 damage from adrenal reaction. Your 20% speed boost, your 100 energy resistance and your high jumps.
---
Use  other consumables to resist radiation.
---
The first attack has always happened really quickly. I've been doing workshops recently to get plans and nearly every single one gets attacked within a minute or so.
---
Not defending their screw ups.. but you do realize it's the holiday season right? Most companies get nothing done in the last couple of weeks of December as people are going on vacation. Double so for online games where they don't want to put out an update only to have it crash on Christmas day or something. Expect more fixes to start rolling out in the next few weeks, probably.
---
They were celebrating New Years too! 
---
You're so intelligent with your intro to psych vocabulary. 
---
Just the artillery plan and the necessary crafting materials
---
Or you know, the detailed patch notes everyone asked for, or all the community managers that post here and reply to people... What do you people want when you complain about communication anyway? A personal phone call from Todd? 
---
Thank you for making this post. I'm on my first run at getting the nuke codes and I just kept running Hide and Seek and Destroy. I was going nuts trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. 
---
Where do you find the blueprints to do resource extractors outside of workshops?
---
Nope, have materials to craft. 
---
I know, I'm sorry for joking, duping is a serious epidemic. I was just trying to be lighthearted, I even gave you my Upvote. You're right though, it'll help them even more and they're already ruining the market.
---
Shot you a PM with my gamertag.  Hit me up when your online
---
it doesn't. it crashes people in the general vicinity of the duper, *sometimes*.
---
the servers are crap because of Bethesda. remember that bull about stash size affecting server stability? it remained the same before and after the weight glitch.
---
So how do I know if it’s a mod that can be placed into a legendary? Is there a list somewhere of them?
---
That was my only guess
---
Accidently scrapping them for supplies? Has been happening to me also 
---
&gt; why make it multiplayer at all?
---
To play a singleplayer game, but with other people. Doesn't have to be an MMO to be a multiplayer game.
---
Hmm.. Seems todays gamers can't imagine a multiplayer game that isn't either an MMORPG or a deathmatch.
---
I dont see how when we got ingame accounts saying otherwise.
---
Their updates/communication were awful since launch, by near any comparison. They also just had their only real end-game system stop working today and haven't said anything aside a few vague and unhelpful comments on a thread here.
---
The game scraps them if you don't have enough resources to cover the building or repair of an item.
---
I'm currently a melee build. Pretty much maxed out. I can kill a schortchbeat in like 3 to 4 hits. 
---
Idk if that helps at all, but I love my melee build
---
The battle of the scortched is over friend gonna celebrate today with no armor in the bog who knew their weakness was everyone collectively being hammered and an 8 turning into a 9 the nukes are no longer needed now it's time to rebuild like the vault hag taught us ! 
---
The same complaint was made in Fallout 4 with soups requiring dirty water instead of purified. They didn't bother fixing it then. They didn't fix it for 76 when they added Boiled Water. I doubt it's going to be fixed any time soon.
---
As a lower level player (lvl 40) I wish for this too or if there was a way we to repay that player. I’ve had some awesome ppl help me out quite a bit. Earlier today I was struggling to defend the red rocket truck stop and some random guy (lvl 140ish) showed up out of no where and bailed me out, afterwards he was saying he had an legendary piece of armor lvl 40 that he didn’t need but wanted to give it to someone who could use it. Best piece of armor I’ve had in the guy. Props to you mysterious wanderer!!!
---
They've always happened shortly after taking over the workshop, sure.  But "shortly" usually seemed to mean "within the first few minutes."  Now it seems barely 30 seconds goes by and I'm already being attacked.  I don't think it's just my imagination- just wanted to see if anybody else found it was suddenly happening quicker.  
---
Yea , found the place just yesturday! I see nothing wrong with 1 or 2 falling on the state. 
---
Damn PS4 sorry bro 
---
Would you say it's better than any gun build? End game wise would it be good?
---
Class Freak doesn't work on some of the effects. I'll bet this is one of those situations.
---
For example, one of the mutations causes -2 to all stats when not in a group and it stays -2 even with rank 3 of Class Freak equipped.
---
It looked plastic in the promotional stuff to me. This all just feels like a case of people going "Look! Another outrage to piggyback off of! Get 'em!"
---
Camden park has a couple around the central roller coaster
---
 I run a heavy weapon/melee combo and I love it.  Melee is great when things are on the ground 
---
Bethesda really needs to have the displayed Unlock message for picking locks in red for players' C.A.M.P.s like the other Bethesda Fallout games.  Anyone that has played Fallout 3 or Fallout 4 would know that any display message in red would be a criminal action.  
---
Found a player's locked house and wanted to see what their home looked like.  Due to my curious nature, I naturally picked the lock and got the Wanted level.  At least it was better than the one time where I was attacked by a couple of PvPers that were 50 levels higher than me.
---
You'll get a guaranteed long range weapon from Patrol Duty.
---
You can get the handmade from any quest or event that drops a random plan. You can even pick it up in-world or in a container.
---
There is no level lock. The level stuff people talk about has to do with vendors and not quests or events.
---
Does it scale with the amount of health you have or the amount you lose? I always thought it was how much you had at that time
---
Yeah but you chew with your mouth open and having to deal with that for 20 years was just way too much.
---
Nah I didn’t bother I just kept on truckin but it sure would have been nice to have. I kinda suck at this game I’m level 40 and that was the first mod I’ve ever gotten for power armor 
---
They fix the silo elevators?
---
If you put multiple in a storage container (even a paper bag) and then pick them up you lose all but one.
---
And not fixing it makes it so they can just dupe it again. You don't clean the blood up before you apply the tourniquet.
---
It's random sometimes if seen raider power armor at level 45 before.
---
I wish we were at least allowed to use the drops when this happens.
---
I wasn't carrying a lot of junk when this happened to me, so I didn't mind dying a lot. I was level 24 and all the spawns were level 40-65. I had never seen monsters that level before. I threw 5 molotov cocktails on some mob of 10 ghouls chasing me across the golf course. I died. None of them did. 
---
Overencumbered, as always, I could only respawn back at the course. I think, now that they're all at 10% HP, maybe I can sneak and pick them off one-on-one and loot them with a few lives. It works! It's pretty awesome! And I actually used so much ammo I had to switch guns -- I was actually grateful since my ammo stash had been taking up too much space.
---
Takes some 5 lives to kill the wendigo in the basement, but it's novel and I'm digging it and now I understand the joke about the clown outfit. I end up getting some loot I had never seen before. I feel like, "this is why you team up! So you can take on higher level areas and get cool drops."
---
But then I realized I couldn't use any of it. The drops are level 40 and I'm level 24. Storing the drops for 16 levels will fill my stash box -- kind of like how I was collecting pieces for my power armor but couldn't place the pieces inside it until I hit level 25, maxing out my stash box for 10 levels.
---
It's like every opportunity to make the game exciting -- finding something rare -- and who cares? You can't use it, you can't carry it.
---
The mechanics dissuade teaming up and fighting above your level. You're expected to grind low-level map locations until you hit 60 and can continue following the quest (so you can survive the parts of the map where high-level people camp and farm)? Boring.
---
If u dont have the problem to go melee... YES you will XD
---
my second char ended up to go main, is lvl 70+ and deal sooooo nice dmg and is the a non power armor char and also TANKY XD
---
my build is a Powerfist/Deathclaw Gauntled Melee build with all defense perks on STR,END,AGI + Mutations and its realy good from the beginning, no ammunition problems, nice armor, nice dps, nice qualitiy of life perks can be also added without loosing fighting qualitiy... i never was a fan of melee and sayed: melee is for adrenalin freaks... now... im one my self and LOVE it... the only downside is... this god dam flying beasts dont want come down to DIE \*rage\* but if they land on the ground... mine mine mine mine mine XD
---
you should try on melee char and test it, im a believer now \^\^
---
In addition to what the poster said below.
---
Most events with a boss will count for a commendation. Heart of the Swamp, Grafton Day, and Line in the Sand all come to mind.
---
Line the Sand is by far the best, 2-3 commendations per event from all the scorchedbeasts.
---
How many hours have you played on 76?
---
I *think* I have that, I vaguely remember seeing artillery in my build thing. How do you use it, though?
---
lol this game.... how tf did they break silos? Guess they realized, oops our cool down for last night on nukes is not wearing off O_o
---
Not stacked. Which is why INT is utterly useless as it is. Weapon artisan pretty much overrides the need for INT. 
---
I was under the impression that those cans were lead..maybe they give both 
---
Then why schedule the game for the holiday season?
---
Level 22 Agility Perk
---
Considering not everyone would like to spend an excess amount of time on their CAMP I think this'd work nicely. Though I'd also like them to get dirt foundations in as well.
---
I'm thinking of doing a PA melee build 
---
Get the plaguewalker mutation and tag every mob ever. Kill your brahmin, start pvp accidentally . It's fun! 
---
And you can double that with excavator armor. At least I think.
---
Sent FR to magicbob22
---
nope
---
Wait a little. They're currently broken
---
Yes ik but it hasn't shown up yet.
---
I’ve been gaming since the late 80s. I’m happy anyone at all is telling me stuff. Now get off my lawn, you damn kids. 
---
That's literally the last sentence in the post lol.
---
Say I disconnect and my friend goes and plops their camp down where mine was (with all my structures still there) and then I reconnect to that server and replace my camp. Now my friend has a fully built camp for free and still get to keep mine. 
---
Thanks, I'm surprised it's not made more obvious in game (unless I missed something); after being unable to enter 94 I ran around the outside for a solid 5min looking for a body of one of the religious folk with a password on it.
---
But Dork Souls doesn't have player trading, does it?
---
If I engage in PvP with another player, yes I would prefer to know they aren't cheating. Getting killed by someone you know earned it, is totally different than going up and losing to an exploiter.
---
As for PvE it is the exploiter's problem because we share the same world. Simple as that. I shouldn't have to worry about trying to avoid that kind of experience while playing. 
---
Overall it just hurts the community, as seen by the varying opinions everyone has. We all feel like we are right and it just creates a negative atmosphere, here and in game. 
---
Use some "unused" perk points first.
---
Wall devorations?
---
This is exactly the right solution. Just a simple option you can select before you log in to a server, or maybe a Setting you can toggle under the Gameplay section.
---
Main issue I can see is when you jump to a friend's server, but as long as a little warning pops up if it's different from your current setting I think it should be fine.
---
I have 14 int...
---
Personally, I'm excited to see what they'll bring. Shame it's not more obvious in game (unless I missed something)
---
What do you play on if you're on Xbox I can make you one to get you by until you find the plan 
---
Try restarting your game cause its under wall decor for me.
---
Sometimes they use they mods if you have materials bulked or sometimes they use it just because.
---
If you're mods are in your stash they will get scrapped of your crafting something with steel (ammo usually). Keep your mods in your personal inventory. And be careful, the game transfers your mods into your stash when you click "store all junk"
---
Ahaha who would buy that lol. Trash gun. But if that’s the only explosive gun then I guess it’s better than none 
---
I was more making fun of the idea that you're shitposting to tell people to move on when you clearly haven't
---
People will never be satisfied and act like devs are their personal slaves or something. Please constantly reassure me and acknowledge me, I’m so needy tell me you love please mr dev. I want handjobs while you whisper patch notes into my ear. 
---
It’s the holidays, let people enjoy time with their families. I know you don’t give a shit about them and expect them to be at your service 24/7, but they are entitled to time off just like you are. 
---
I have none 
---
Bought it last night; still not appearing. Where exactly in wall decor?
---
Starched genes prevent it you can farm mutations at the radioactive factory east of white springs just make sure to take off starched genes then as you are about to take the shower put it on because you will lose your mutations. It’s is time limited to get mutations after you get a mutation so when your farming just server hop
---
Or I could just find someone and say, "Hey, want a free camp?" And then disconnect. Then boom, free camp for them no loss for me. 
---
a little window allowing you to trade stuff doesn't really make or break the concept of player trading.
---
They have those planters in a number of areas with plants in them I wish we could build and plant in those.  
---
&gt;  It doesn't really work that great as single player game, because of the limits of interaction with the world.
---
It has less limitations than MMOs. It has less limitations than most co-op campaign games. But yes, because it runs of a server, there has to be certain limitations.
---
&gt; In Fallout 4 I kept playing because of the npcs and the the settlements.
---
Well if that's all that got you trough FO4, I can understand you don't like FO76. But Fallout had a lot more than just NPCs and the rather basic settlement system..
---
&gt; And I don'T have to mmo content either to keep going.
---
Why would you expect it to have MMO-like content?
---
Wendingo cave. Old abandoned Bog Town. Huntersville. Morgantown Airport
---
Would be cool if you could advertise on the map
---
There's a new PvP mode coming. Let's just hope they fix PvP as a whole in time.
---
Wait what?
---
I actually think this has the best potential chance to be implemented, out of all of the suggestions for a common space, since it could theoretically be added in as an elevator only accessible floor of the Whitesprings. That way they also don't have to worry about the implications of how to handle nuke targeting of the common area as they would be forced to if say TotW Mezz. was the chosen locale. Great idea!
---
How about playing a better game like rust
---
I'd put a level 15 int perk card into it.
---
Pistol packin mommmmaaaa, put. that. pistooool. doooown..
---
u can sure thing, btw i got now with only selffound items and perks  350+ all resists and later after i have maybe all of my up to 35+def on how low your health is MORE then a PA if im getting a little bit in trouble ;) and sidenote nr 2... i can go with my build on a nuked whitespring only equiped with a hazmat suit ;))))))) 
---
It will still use them. Repaired my camp with 40-50 mods in stash last week and PLENTY of mats after a trifecta of SB's leveled it in an attack.
---
Stupid game used all my mods except excavator instead of my mats to repair my camp.
---
I was ,and am furious. Bought all those mods at robot vendors with hard earned caps. About 6k worth.
---
Hit up the bos bases. Leveled power armor spawns there. 
---
Really should have been a 2019 release :/ .
---
I mean if you weren't there the mobs would be lower level, kind of ruining the game for new players trying to experience it imo
---
Imagine trying to do he vaults in the first week, pushing past all the other players eager for something to do, jumping over their heads to be able to kill at least one enemy, queuing for a terminal etc. 
---
Right, why would a company care what consumers think of their products.
---
Glowing meat stacks with other melee buff food, you can have 20% ))
---
Dude, the infinite loading screen bug is still a thing. Rose getting stuck and not updating quests still happens. Server crashes are frequent for a lot of people.  
---
SBQ is the only endgame to speak of and between risking the server crashing halfway through a silo, her bugging out and becoming unkillable or her straight up not having her loot load in its barely worth the effort to nuke the Prime.  
---
The only other endgame thing to do is farm legendaries. The only ways to effectively do that clearly weren’t intended by BGS (Whitespring nukes) and Legendary enemies are buggy - sometimes dropping no legendaries, sometimes dropping incorrect *-level legendaries, and just as frequently non-legendary enemies dropping legendaries.  
---
Water purifiers being stuck in your CAMP is a minor bug, but there’s a hell of a lot of minor bugs - as somebody pointed out a few days ago even wires taking up invisible CAMP limits is a problem.  
---
The duping issue has been blamed for server crashes, but to further the problem if BGS hopes to implement any kind of player based economy at any point the abundance of TSE weapons (which simultaneously break PvP and PvE) means the economy will be lopsided.  
---
If you want to defend the game that’s fine. I’ve enjoyed what I’ve played and don’t regret buying the game. But unless there’s some major developments in the next patch and not just minor bug fixes, I’m out.  
---
They’ve spent so long getting the game to an acceptable state that I’ve no doubt it’s pushed back their content release roadmap. Currently, there’s nothing more than farming TSE and Bloodied weapons in uninteresting and unreliable ways.
---
Should be able to add a flag to the loot bag 
---
This is one of the reasons I enjoy playing this game. I can just go at my own pace when I have time and don't feel like I'm missing out on any content.  
---
I actually stopped playing modes in another game because of this. Having to long in everyday just because becomes more of a chore than fun. 
---
I'm always jealous of people who live in the area's that Fallout games are set. I live in DC, so I'd really love an HD update to Fo3, even though they all the made all the monuments so tiny and close together. How does 76's map compare? Is that really what the Grafton monster looks like? Why does he just stand there and let me shoot him? I have so many questions!
---
🎶..Lay that thing down before it goes off and hurts somebody..🎶
---
:(   Sorry to hear that, m8.   This really sucks!!
---
Especially with lead belly. Drink from this stream? No problem! Oh don’t touch it with your hands you get rads!
---
Rust isn't better than fo76
---
I’m online now 
---
Detailed patch notes that people had to complain about to get
---
For me its right above the metal signs and under the vault 76 posters.
---
You have no way of knowing if an item you traded for was duped or not. Are you really suggesting people have items deleted that they paid thousands of caps for?
---
That’s very good to know!
---
12 year olds. 12 year olds never change.
---
Yeah, I’ve had this happen a couple times while right near higher level players. Figured it was this, but hard to tell for sure. But health dropping from seemingly out of nowhere and chewing through a couple stimpacks 
---
I dont think this is Bethesda's jurisdiction 
---
I don't need to since I have a 100 power generator. 
---
Once I'm kinda bored with my stuff I'll go to flatwoods or something and message "you lead and I'll take shots when you need help."  This helps them acquaint with the game and gets me a few xp points and some stimpaks or something.
---
Yeah, it's the standard method for the rare guns. Doesn't even matter which level you craft, so for example you can unlock all the handmade rifle mods by spamming level 15 versions.
---
lol if u put explosive perk with that it shreds  the queen
---
I just send a support ticket to Bethesda with hope the will fix it. 
---
I find it not funny stupid game. 
---
That’s true. Contacted support for an unrelated reason and they said they couldn’t do anything to my inventory. 
---
That’s very odd. 
---
Just wished that worked with the well - I think that might be how he's collecting water and that takes FOREVER.
---
Also, hey, there’s a wooden door, there should be at least six screws from the hinges. 
---
&gt;People will never be satisfied and act like devs are their personal slaves or something.
---
Never talked about devs. They way you generalize doesn't really convince me to read any further, have a nice day!
---
Hmm maybe. But that kibda burns the people who bought the furst couple things instead of waiting.
---
As for people getting upset, eh I doubt it.  Just so long as the different colors arent just retints. Tints flatten a texture terribly.  And just so long as the individual colors are cheep. Not 400 a pop! Sgoot, we already have a few recolors if camo up there. We just need like.. More.
---
I despise that 90% of the quests are all part of the main one. I thought finding the enclave was special but its just a part of the main one .-.
---
Given they've confirmed it as a bug, it's likely the server clocks that control the silo's we're incorrectly coded in regards to the calendar year changing- makes sense given the close proximity to the new year.
---
My Xbox doesn’t have anything of the sort pop up when I hold down power to shut off 
---
Seriously - that's a police matter. Why do you think you should post this on Reddit? You need to immediately involve the police and not post shit about it.
---
Lmao Claptrap and I are separate people. But yeah, I just had a thought. Why not prevent players from even carrying more than twice their carry weight? Right now we have dupers with second characters that are 5 tonnes over encumbered. If we limit a 250 lb. carry weight character to 500 lbs. of over-encumbered capacity, that will at least mitigate their ability to dupe endlessly.
---
Of course, that is only a minor fix and cheaters would find a work around. All weight reduction perks on their mules would be the norm
---
I'm not even joking when I say this...but report his ass to local police and/or the FBI.
---
You don't EVER fucking threaten to kill someone or their family. Of course he's not serious, but people like him need to be taught a lesson.
---
You probably built a wall with them
---
Also are there actually any filters to purify water? (Not an issue with enough purified water) I see the recipie with filters but I’ve never seen any.
---
It has several! Problem is that a lot of the time the Miners that spawn are under level 50, so sadly they typically drop less than max level legendary items.
---
That's a pretty low standard, mate. ;)
---
Take out the PS4 in your title, can’t read shit on Xbox either 
---
Whitesprings. After you nuke, check out the area around the bunker. Look on the hill on top of the bunker, along the road to the east of the bunker, and the forested area south of the bunker for glowing tree sap, glowing silt beans. There are also blast berries right by the fence in front of the bunker. The forested areas will be your best bet. 
---
Mods don't need any materials. They can be applied for free. The resources on the right are just informative.
---
Don't bother, they cannot fix it.
---
There's some in the penitentiary too 
---
A Weapon Balance Patch would go a long way to fix all of this. 
---
I was worried I was the only one.  They could easily (i hope) add something akin to how they let you read the text in The Last of Us (Aka giving you the option to read the letters and notes as plain text rather than handwritten stuff)
---
Everything I’ve read says level 15-20 have the best shot. I started looking at lv 30 and had zero luck. 
---
Can you tame just any creature? I thought it had to be a random encounter creature. 
---
And some of the sidequests are just do some random thing for no reason whatsoever with no payoff. Like kill a wendigo while dressed as a clown or rescue Mr. Jangles from the amusement park or play jukeboxes in that one town.
---
I've already provided my "argument", which was basically just fact stating that there are people who would do meet ups in a video game on a holiday.
---
You just keep moving the goalposts.
---
They will not be able to do anything.
---
Probably a 10 yo thinking they are frightening
---
Yep, I have the same issue. Still stuck in my stored weeks on...😡
---
Pffff 😥😥😥😥
---
xx figures xx
---
I'd run in there with a 50 Cal and make shredded scorched salad
---
Level scaling in zones would solve this issue mostly. If I'm in a lvl 1 - 15 zone scale my characters stats down to lvl 15.
---
Or just enable a war/peace toggle for those who want to be able to PvP and default it to turned on until lvl 20 or something. 
---
From my experience in games like this the low level ganking is usually rebuffed by higher levels coming to save them (which would relieve some of this games endgame boredom) or it's just boring. 
---
UO doesn't really have this problem and there's no protection if you're not on the correct facet. Plenty of events are run on PvP facets and everyone just works together even though you could make a fortune killing everyone and probably get away with it
---
&gt;Getting killed by someone you know earned it, is totally different than going up and losing to an exploiter.
---
not really, you're dead either way. if the duper farmed for months instead, you'd still be dead. alternatively, if the honest player duped his tse shotgun, you'd also be dead.
---
&gt;I shouldn't have to worry about trying to avoid that kind of experience while playing. 
---
avoiding what? not being able to leech off another player? because that's what tagging is.
---
&gt;Overall it just hurts the community, as seen by the varying opinions everyone has.
---
whether it does is irrelevant. the fact is that it has little impact in-game. so no, I'm definitely not for a wipe. give it a couple months and we'd be back where we started.
---
It's not, it's an actual police issue. 
---
Save your time and sell all that to vendors
---
I've found rare weapon plans in level 3 safes, but I'm not sure the chance is any greater than a level 0. Often you open a level 3 and it's just garbage.
---
Saw you and vagrant on my ingame friends list so far. ;)
---
I tend to join servers of friends if I see them online, might run into you some day. :)
---
not at all. people often do that indeed, but most definitely not here as proven by last night.
---
it would also have been very stupid of them to disable a major feature in the game, one that people most definitely prefer over meet and greets, just because it's new years. thankfully they're not that dense, hopefully.
---
"later this month" is too late imo. I'm still a little ticked that they would take a 3 week vacation with the game in shambles. I love this game, but there are things that can't just be left alone while the team has their feet up.
---
You're implying that this isn't already the case...you can already buy mutation serums for 600 caps and two shot explosive handmades for 4000 caps
---
I'm gonna be real I haven't launched many nukes because I'm of the type that would like to have a full set of decked out PA before going into Nuke Zones. . . despite much lesser equipped Residents head there.
---
However I run X-01 except I've been server hopping for three weeks straight since I refuse to buy them for three times the price off a player and at this point I can't convince myself to log in since something as simple as modifying my PA to my liking is entirely determined by some arbitrary chance a mod will appear in a Vendor.
---
I'd much prefer X-01 mods be awarded from unique Enclave Events that can be initiated from the base and farmed.
---
And made it a latrine
---
East Coast of America. Just keep server hopping and you will find a few.
---
How’s this player vending gonna work? Cause my pet sloth attacks even teammates who come anywhere near my camp, hope I don’t have to put vending machine near Mr. Cuddles or people will probably attack back and kill him 
---
Gt xxxjrobbxxx 
---
What happened?
---
We are horrible people XD
---
And please tell me exactly how bethesda is going to perform a server-wide change on all specifically duped items if they admit to not even having the tools to give somebody back a power armor frame or legendary weapon that disappeared due to a bug, with screenshot and video evidence?
---
I wasn't aware that it had mods as I haven' had much chance to play with this one yet, currently building into a low hp/high rad build for chainsaw that might show off it's top damage when it's done.  I am pretty sure I have seen schematics for the drill as well so it might be even better simply because you don't have to farm it up unlike with the chainsaw.
---
Lol reposting my thread when I made this post well before bethesda ever made an official comment.
---
That doesn't stop the fact that you're mutated and still may want to speak to your doctor about it. 
---
Oooh man - all of this has got me wanting to fire up a freebie account and go old school!
---
Thank you all for this fantastic trip down EQ Memory Lane folks; now to see if I end up roaming Everfrost again ;)
---
I don't know, maybe they don't too much business but enjoy the small sales. 
---
Ma and Pa shop type. Maybe they are great at bargaining. 
---
I for one support small businesses :P
---
Or perhaps to set into better context, lets say Tommy Jones plays 20 hours a week; his ability to trade is still dwarfed by a duper. 
---
My point is that you are just making up random statements which don't actually form a coherent argument.
---
I think you might be, but it really doesn’t matter if you do or don’t if you just dump the gear. 
---
You need the plans Advanced Power Connectors and then they show up.
---
True but id rather make my enemies fear me than be a giverment sience project 
---
&gt;Expecting it to run on a 5 year old console and a brand new console is the issue, they can't make a different game for the Xbox One and the Xbox One X.
---
So they should make a game for the *shock* XBox One.
---
Okay thanks, I'll keep an eye out for them
---
A ban is a bit too far in my opinion 
---
Lol sorry, forgot to check if it was even the same person replying 🤦 classic right?
---
But, well idk, I think that limit might prove tough to implement. What if the legendaries that are dropping for you at Whitesprings are heavy weapons or other things you're not perked for, and you can't hold more than a couple even if you're willing to be encumbered? Or if you switch off a carry wt perk and suddenly are way over your a "max hold". Or what about when you climb out of Excav Armor w/ Calibrated Shocks? That's a 200lb drop in carry weight, so that'd drop your "max hold" by 400. What happens to all that stuff?
---
Well, it looked cool. 
---
I was looking for another setting because all fallout games are really hard on people who are red/green colorblind.  I will frequently wander in circles, trying to find that critter I just shot. It doesn't help that ragdoll phsics often toss corpses far away in random directions. 
---
I swear though that the design artists make spotting things intentionall difficult. Like a dead mole miner in the ash heap looks strikingly similar to a lot of the boulders that are lying around. 
---
Nuke silos are all I’ve seen
---
Its one of those rare ninja-bots
---
You can't throw nukes right know is disable
---
I have mixed feelings about the game... but I feel this needs to be said... you can easily grind a few hundred atoms a day (even I can as a 30 year old dad that can only play an hour or two a day). I have thousands of atoms worth of stuff and have paid nothing... there are daily and weekly challenges you can do to get atoms very easily... just gotta practice a little patience.

it's 201*9*, you'd expect people to know not to take idle threats seriously.
---
on PSN of all fucking places.
---
I’m easily pleased :)
---
It doesn’t work?
---
I think it's a very well-formatted and written post. 10/10, friend.
---
There is an on-off switch on there, make sure you activate it so it shows on. So far I have not had an issue with it supplying the 10 power.  For example, in the Poseidon workshop, there is a power box on either side of the fusion core reactor.  Even with the plant offline each box give 10.  So you can power two extractors off of that and not worry about generators.
---
How many hours?
---
none works because you cant request the codes in the enclave bunker terminal, you can only request the nuclear keycard
---
It appears nukes are glitched and unlaunchable
---
&gt; it plays like an MMO, with the constant grind for upgrades
---
That a game has randomly generated stats on loot isn't unique to MMOs. That you want to grind for the best weapon is you making your own fun.
---
the heat sync and cpu cooler and cpu are only like maby 5 months old tops.  its an AMD ryzen so shouldnt be over heating this badly.. and it only happens during fallout 76 like i can play Ark and it dosent get this hot
---
They aren't technically disabled, but the elevators are currently glitched and not letting people enter any of the silos to launch.
---
They are
---
Mine is right near site alpha, happened every damn time until I moved it away from the cliffs
---
Have this same issue! Lost 4 x T60 Calibrated shocks, an X01 Jetpack and T51 stealthboy. So PISSED!!! 
---
Makes sense since mole men cap at lvl 40
---
Yeah tried that. Thats what I was doing in the pick.
---
I just want a playable version of Wac-A-Commie
---
Swamp gas could be from those areas where bubbles rise out of water in the more. Or anywhere based on the guy below.
---
Just got attacked by three scorchbeasts at once. It wasn't an event...
---
I GOT SPURRRRRSSS
---
all that can control turrets are level 3
---
As unfortunate as it is, I feel as if duped items are here to say. The damage is done and the game economy is a joke.
---
I would expect an explosive nerf tho
---
Oh, I will do this as soon as I get to my desk!
---
Minigun with shredder barrel.

(Mic Drop)
---
If you haven’t figured it out from the subreddit, if you have a resource node in the buildable area of your camp, you can build an extractor on it to harvest for free. There are resource maps online. 
---
Sometimes see a 96 glowing deathclaw in the courtyard area infront of Whitespring. It's either that, lvl 50 glowing wolves, honey beasts, or glowing yao guai any time I'm around there.
---
&gt; I haven’t bought shit and will not buy shit from the Atom store.

Good! That stuff is way overpriced.

Stored
---
Tell that to the family of the guy who was murdered by police last year because an online troll "made an idle threat" that wasn't so idle.
---
it's a lot less gear dependent compared to gun builds, also having more carry weight and fewer scrap requirements makes the game less tedious
---
Like what, me thinking improvements have been made but they still have a lot more to do? Is it that because I don't think that is hard to follow. The reason I said they made a lot of improvements was to highlight how much progress they would still have to do. Its obvious to see if you have played the game that they still have to make progress.
---
I was informed there was a room with a coffin and missing floor by a friend of mine and considering how large the asylum is I assumed it was a room I have not discovered yet. I may have been misinformed.
---
same here man, i’m roleplaying as a witch of the wilds with my creepy camp in the swamp and would loooove raider or super mutant decor :(
---
Some people do it because they dont want the other person around so they attack them until they leave, example being farming location where you compete for spawns
---
I have never had food spoil while offline so not sure what is going on there. As for food and drink management, you can plant crops and have water purifiers at your CAMP so it's possible to keep up with it pretty easily. And if you make soup, it gives you both at once so that works well
---
X-01 has the highest rad resistance, not T60
---
Yep. Especially after 200 hours of play. 
---
I had also read that, I’ve got the post saved actually. 
---
Only things that get “lighter” when bulked are Lead, Aluminium and Acid, no benefit to bulking other items. 
---
Your stash will get less full bulking say, all your steel, but only because you use up whatever plastic to do it and plastic is a useful commodity in its own right for ammo etc. 
---
Also; in the spirit of PSAs; make sure you actually scrap your junk. I had unscrapped things like extinguishers which when broken down saved weight. Not even sure how that happened but still worth a check to make sure anything you have is in its “raw” component state. 
---
I don't celebrate this time of year. Humbug.
---
I played entirely naked all last night irl and not a single person in-game commented on it. I 100% get you.
---
I have no idea what you're talking about. but even so, that's 1 in a billion.
---
Odd, it just appeared. Thank you!
---
Are you disabled, it literally says “STASH BOXES” at the top of the page...
---
&gt; I'd love to see an actual source from all of you claiming the game is "hemorrhaging" players.
---
Yea, I'd quite like to see the source of the 'fact' that dupers are the cause of the server instability - speaking of which, if this issue is **so** bad, maybe Bethesda should focus on killing that exploit, how long's it been going on for now?
---
&gt;I expect it to run on the generation is was sold on.
---
Again I think you're stupid because the Xbox One, Xbox One S, and Xbox One X are not the same "generation".
---
Its just not going to happen people, all theyre going to do is attempt to fix the exploit over and over again
---
Also, Ultracite has the highest DR, not T51b
---
This is a tricky issue
---
I've purchased a gun for 4k caps that I was reluctant to purchase from a person who swore on his son that it wasn't duped after I told him it felt fishy.
---
If I were to find out the gun was duped, it would suck but I'd rather it not exist at all than to have a glitched gun. 
---
I also feel like most of the time when some is trading with a duper, they know it.
---
With all that said, I really just want the perpetrators themselves punished/banned
---
Meet me at the vault?
---
Honestly they just need to increase the weapon level cap. That'll devalue all of the duped weapons instantly, and it's bound to happen eventually anyway. 
---
Okay I’m coming 
---
Yes I love the music, much more variety of songs both new or from the other games would be awesome!
---
don't know about X1 but PS4 is deader than PC. and has more kids.
---
Fallout players are mostly loners. just look at the number of sex mods. don't know what got over Todd to assume 76 was a good idea.
---
The real kicker is that they might not have the tools because it might be a limitation of the engine and therefore could \*never\* be added. Unfortunately that sort of situation in an online game with several pvp elements spells trouble in the long run. I suppose we'll see!
---
Put it on their feedback page, not reddit
---
ban them forever please. 
---
No doubt
---
Yeah, like one of the passives on int is how much basic scrap you get back. This scales exponentially per point (but in the other way, like where you have a fraction as the exponent). How come things like "melee damage from strength" scale linearly but INT's passive gets less the more you put into it.
---
I would swap the perk that decreases enemies melee damage for the one that ignores 75% of their armor. It starts with like "in" something 
---
Have you seriously never heard of swatting? It's gotten at least 1 person killed and many others injured or thrown in jail.
---
True, weapon rebalance as well as calculated power creep.
---
But it only fixes the legendary weapon issue. Not the rare resources like flux, unique or rare plans, collections of magazines, bottle caps (nuka cola), ammo, and other crap
---
Thanks so much man
---
yea my bank chara is level 5, and lives near the overseers camp, i give things to rookies camping past all the time
---
They tweeted 3 hours ago that they were working on it. You're looking for reasons to be more upset at this point.
---
Also Morgantown High; plastic pumpkin lanterns, plates and bowling balls. 
---
Some of us would love this, others would quit playing
---
You're cool.  Carry on.
---
Not according to the game's guide. It says int just affects basic scrap you get from crafting (caps at like +66%), bonus condition on craft, bonus durability on crafted items (seems to be broken or has a much lower scale), and amount of passwords in hacking minigame.
---
It removes 75% of the penalty, at the cost of 3 pts. So with Starched Genes, that's five pts of Luck to live with minimal penalties as a Mutant. Just know what you're getting into is all lol, but good luck! 
---
Might I recommend checking the market subreddits for Serums, they'll give you specific mutations instead of random ones, as well as temporarily remove all negative effects of mutations. You should be able to find them for 500-1K caps, but often as low as 400 if you find a good seller.
---
Go to your xbox settings&gt;display and sound &gt; volume &gt; chat mixer. Select "do nothing" I thought i had the same bug since release but it's not a bug it's because you probably have reduce sounds on for chat and when your in game your "always available for chat" in a sense
---
U ran away and he chased me down lol.
---
what op posted has nothing to do with swatting.
---
a kid threatened to hire a hitman because he has op's dox. it's completely different.
---
Respect if you are playing the game as it was meant but there are websites like nukacrypt that decrypt and post the weekly launch codes for each silo just fyi 
---
Can I buy the glasses ? 
---
PA melee works well, you can easily go over 1k dmg with it.
---
How? In almost any online game where the developers gives crap, exploiters and cheaters are banned, suspended, or punished. We can do character wipes instead as long as it comes with an account suspension
---
That's in strength and I have max cards in strength already, no room ;-; unless I should change a card?
---
Check flatwoods or grafton station, that where i get mine on both characters
---
That's cool. Some of friends dont either, so I get it.
---
Maybe they're working on the PA glitch to skip the laser grids? 
---

---
You mean like gunsmith and armorer and nearly all the int perks?
---
Just pointing out that it fits right in with Bethesda's other decisions.
---
Because they want to have fun playing their own style
---
Sorry not for sell my dude, I literally just found these things
---
I'm sure that Bethesda will eventually fix the duping exploit, the important thing to know is if they have the tools to actually differentiate between the original item and duped ones.
---
Sure you could just ban people who crafted 300 lvl 1 boards or people who have mules with thousands of nuka cola bottles or hundreds of serum recipes, TSE weapons, etc. But what if an innocent player bought a duped item(without knowing) with rightfully earned caps from another player? What if he found one on a vendor-bot? What if some random player gifted him a free serum/outfit because he/she has unlimited supply of them?
---
There are way to many variables to this and I don't know if Bethesda can actually track all the different paths that an item could have taken to reach another player hands.
---
Those ones arent tameable afaik, you can only tame a few from specific encounters at random encounter locations. Cant just tame any creature you see in the wild
---
I had it disappear, I logged in out and restarted.  I finally got it back.  But now I need to restart the quest. WTF?!??
---
Oh okay and where did you find them ?
---
If you have pharma farma don't forget to hit search to activate the perk when searching containers. Once I started doing this I became overloaded with stimpaks. 
---
Patch was for PC only. Was pretty quick maybe just a few mb's?  Addresses duping, locking up on exiting and 1 or 2 other things. 
---
Also not sure why you're getting downvoted. 
---
You are 100% absolutely wrong.  T-51 (level 50) fully upgraded has the highest Physical and Energy Resistances.  I posted an image comparing the T-51 and X-01 earlier, but I will take a screenshot if asked, and post proof to show you.
---
Did you save up old perk points hoping to spend them on level 50 perks? It doesn't work that way. You're not "level 50" until you have spent 49 perk points
---
I mean, they never did prove that people could steal items off of each other with trade either. I tried multiple ways with my husband and I couldn't get into his power armor when that was supposedly a thing. 
---
Like, so much stuff that people have become hysterical over ended up being (seemingly) bullshit. Meanwhile, other than the power armor fiasco, neither I nor my friends/husband have ever experienced any of these other crazy issues that supposedly absolutely plague everyone *constantly*. Hell even the server instability seems to be grossly exaggerated. 
---
I found this while looking inside the General’s Steakhouse. There’s a note about the people who run the place leaving photos so they have access to Watoga. Every time you read that note, it gives you tennis quest.
---
The NPC settlements didn’t even have to be huge.  We didn’t need another Diamond City or Megaton.  A few NPC free staters hiding in their last bunker or the last of the brotherhood camped out in a cave.  Small group of responders holding down a small camp somewhere.  Just a few would have made a huge difference.  Even if they just gave quests it would have made the quests more engaging.  They didn’t even need tons of dialogue.
---
My reassembly required quest disappeared.  I had to log in/out to get the quest back.  And when I did I had to restart it from the beginning.  Really annoying. 
---
Not everyone who's selling things for cheap are dupers or are lowering their prices because of said dupers. Some people want to sell at reasonable prices.
---
That terminal is broken at the moment. Silos are broken too. There will be no nuking until further notice. 
---
Things seem a bit more lively on XBone, though. In watching some of the funny shit people have done on YouTube, they mostly seem to be on that console.
---
I highly doubt everyone just went home for 3 weeks. They probably took the public holidays off and that was it. 
---
100%.
---
And please let us play wack-a-commie with the commie wacker
---
Like your work; the traps around the turrets are a good idea as they don’t seem to engage when the enemies are too close and small e.g. molerats 
---
Brain fart. Thanks, I corrected the OP. 
---
Got it, thanks for the info. Haven't tried to tame anything yet, wasn't sure what was/wasn't tameable.
---
I think it’s still needed and I have two (likely) duped TSE weapons I spent 10k on... 
---
So yeah I’d be fine if they disappeared as long as all the dupers did too
---
They have already told us they plan on fixing the game. If they don't it'll die.
---
But most people who are aware of it agree that duping is one of the biggest issues.
---
Also, you are saying to break out the torches after the game is "fixed"? Who knows when this game will be completely free of bugs, no matter how big or small.
---
Maybe they’re just trying to be more like all the companies that existed in the game, have you read those terminals 
---
Tell that to the people who use duplication glitches to break the already fragile servers. Not to mention that enemies respawn like crazy. 
---
Ok. Well given the responses, looks like I stand corrected.
---
Thanks for opening my eyes to this. 
---
The point is you never know who the hell you are fighting with on the other end of that internet connection. 
---
Threatening to kill someone and their family should never be taken as an idle threat.
---
And no, they aren't much different. Swatting turns police INTO the hitman, that's the point.
---
And after reading terminal entries at the Ranger District Office the circle got a little smaller. They didn’t seem connected to each other (The note and the terminal entries).
---
I'm going to guess you have a lot of perks for it. I have none and in a nuke zone can go through 6 or 7 in absolutely no time.
---
Ok I was wrong about the Ultracite by one point but the x-01 is best rad resist.
---
They aren't reasonable prices though. These things easily sell (or rather used to) for much higher. The only reason people are lowering anywhere this far is because dupers have hundreds of them and selling for 4000 caps instead of 12000 caps is better than nothing for them
---
Thanks for letting me know :) 
---
What do you have as a CPU cooler? What brand and model? My shity ass amd x6 1090t, which should run hotter than a ryzen, dosnt even go over 60°c (140°F) in both games you mentioned.
---
Agreed; different water types should yield either more or better output. 
---
As someone who uses PA all the time, I have around 90 cores on me at this point. I take them whenever I see them, and I pass them out to lower levels wearing PA whenever I see them just because I have so many. This perk literally allows me to share the love of using PA so I love it 
---
Im lvl 194 and find stuff to do every day..
---
But I exploited the game and skipped all content :(
---
I really miss having that song playing while I'm roaming the wasteland.  
---
Just to clarify - I'm only level 109 so I'm still free to complain, right? Don't want to break your new rule. 
---
i can do 3k caps.
---
The ATLAS Observatory (a little bit north of the Top of the World) has some level 3 terminals. 
---
I’d really recommend going there not just for the loot and exp (lots of robobrains) but if you unlock the terminals the backstory for that location is actually really interesting! 
---
Ahh I see, good point.
---
New years is total bullshit.  I get what you are saying but if I had run into you last night I would have been too busy scrapping typewriters and cooking scorchbeast lungs to pretend to care about a commercial holiday.  
---
Sorry to hear about your crash, man, that sucks. Just tossing this out there, scrapping syringers will eventually give you the ability to make the endangerol barrel, which uses normal syringer ammo but reduces a target's damage defense by 25% and it make a noticeable difference on SB Queen. 
---
This. This is the real reason we all want to be as far away from each other as possible 
---
You're right t51 has 514 DR and ultracite has 513 DR.
---
&gt;Sure you could just ban people who crafted 300 lvl 1 boards
---
As someone who crafts a bunch of of junk for exp to get rid of excess materials, screw you. 
---
Go to the Silva Homstead. There is a giant field of corn in the backyard. 
---
Sell most of the purified water you get. It adds up and I’ve been banking off of it. Soups are really good because they replenish food and hunger 
---
People on this reddit really just need to learn basic reading comprehension. The amount of people claiming that tweet as indisputable prood that bethesda "disabled the nukes for NYE" is really just... dumb.
---
Thank you op!  
---
My ammo belt thanks you
---
I really wish players were more social , the whole point is to be multiplayer.
---
Jesus dude, I don't have any perks to increase their life and I never carry more than 2 - 3 because even if I spend my entire play in PA I never run out. I dump heaps of cores. 
---
If we're being realistic, the only thing here that seems to be "needed" is the vending machines.
---
Honestly though I don't know how much good that'll do. There aren't many people on each server. I don't feel like an in-game economy is going to work at all unless they implement a built-in way for people to advertise their shop to other servers. 
---
Had your estrogen enema today? 🤔
---
Nukes are broken (or were a couple of hours ago). Can't launch them at present....would have expected Bethesda to maybe inform customers but that seems like to much for them to handle at present. The terminal that you get the mission for the key card would usually offer 3 other missions for Alpha, Bravo or Charlie.
---
Websites that do the codes for you are great n all, but if its the first time someones launching a nuke they may not know that or actually want to do it properly.
---
God would I welcome that.  Scrap legendaries with a chance of learning their perks.
---
Because he sells easily acquired items that only require tedium to make. There is still a market for that. 
---
I tend to play a game until I cant be bothered to at that point, then go play another game until the same thing, then at some point I want to play game 1 again and repeat.  
---
It helps that I mostly own games that you can just mill around in like rimworld, jurassic world evolution ect...
---
  I'd wander into a town and it would pop up with a quest saying something like "Start all of the jukeboxes" and I'd scratch my head and wonder how on Earth my character would walk into a town and go "Y'know what this dilapidated post-nuclear apocalyptic cityscape infested with mutants needs? Some Bing Crosby."
---
Are the silos back up?
---
I now its lore breaking or something, but I'd like Rose's station to play some old punk rock.
---
Nope, not a single one to extend core life..
---
I don't sprint much and just relog if I'm dangerously low
---
I go fourth this
---
They've found a way to dupe players a la Institute technology.  
---
For a small sum of caps you can have a clone of yourself follow you around as an NPC companion.
---
Clearly some people don't know the joy that is running down the highways in power armor imagining a little dude is skating the obstacles on the side of the road as I go.
---
Don't worry there will be new content soon for you to skip and exploit
---
Pst.
---
It's a Trap.
---
Problem is, a lot of people try to play this as an MMO. They grinded to high lvl and are looking for "end game" content. This is not an MMO. It is a Fallout game you play online with other people. The end game is the same as it was for other Fallout games. Explore and survive the wasteland, just do it with your friends instead of alone 
---
I would never have thought to complain about this. THIS. Every FO is the same, shitty music that plays over and over on shuffle until you eventually lean into it or travel the waste in silence. In Fallout, as in life, existence is pain.
---
How do you find resource locations in the world? Because I found an acid one in a pond by accident. 
---
Can we first fix it so I can see what plans I have learned already. 
---
It’s just like in real life, you have to stay busy and entertain yourself during your free time. I feel like a lot of these players complaining about being bored with FO76 are probably easily bored in life as well.
---
Any clue how much power they put out?
---
PLAYER VENDING! 2019 LOOKIN REAL GOOD!
---
I'm seriously hyped for this. I hope it'll let me turn my CAMPS into a serious shop now.
---
I gave up those perks - the noise just started irritating me.
---
On Xbox the inflation is worse than that tse weapons including handmades are being sold on the xbox lfg for a few hundred caps max. Based on the info  I have determed there's a small handful of specific 3 star weapons that have been duped to Oblivion, they seem to be BiS in general I avoid active training but when I group up with randos I'll ask around to trade for specific weapons, generally specify 2 star, non bis items but still really good so I know they aren't duped. I've also bumped into a handful of people that are likely using duped items (only so many times you can see the exact same 3 star in a short time) many of these people may have no idea they are duped or that duping is even an issue if they don't come to this subreddit and just trade with random people or people on the xbox lfg
---
Still A LOT of bugs. Overall enjoy game. The bugs kinda take the fun out of it.
---
Example: glitch right now not allowing anyone to nuke.
---
Btw I'm lvl 127 with 200+hrs and plat trophy: so I'd say I have exp in game lol
---
Oh my god yes, a mod to allow ANY unarmed weapons really. All those poor Miner &amp; Deathclaw gauntlets getting left behind too.
---
Hell the Mole Miner Gauntlet looks like it's practically *designed* to go with Excavator (although the Power Fist design fits perfectly as well lol)
---
They spread them around to reduce the chance beth will take action... cunning really.
---
Beth would ban 100 players, probably not 10k... dupes have spread to almost all endgame players id wager...
---
I refuse to trade so i know i have no duped stuff.
---
I personally enjoy the game, is there things that need to be fixed, yes, but in my opinion, my enjoyment outweighs the negative "hype". I heard that it is redbox, try that first, then if you like the game but it
---
I’m sorry you had to deal with that my experience on PC has been totally different and I always have my voice chat on to talk to people and have some general fun. At level 20 something I got adopted by a squad and they showed me the ropes and I became a contributing member of the “alpha squad” I hope this one experience doesn’t deter you because trust me there’s some cool people out there! 
---
heatherlk if you need to meet him
---
Surely he can get help from the Free Sta...
---
Thats what i was thinking tbh. If so, *facepalm*
---
Not everyone has to sell these items for the highest price. And the serums themselves are bought from the enclave vendor for 5000 caps. If you're making them for selling; around 600~1000 caps is affordable to most players.
---
OP,  I was hanging out with friends in Appalachia I know from RL and we had a great time on NYE at my camp with a random joining us.
---
Some wanted to have these picture frames though so we split up and searched the map later 
---
I can only assume we were on different servers or we just missed each other 
---
Easiest one to do as an example is the parking lot you spawn into when you server hop/fast travel to cranberry glade. Everytime it will be something random like a bunch of super mutants fighting liberators or a crashed satellite. Some of the possible events are tameable creatures
---
Learning a mod is not equivalent to any of those perks.  The perks you reference reduce the cost and or improve the quality, or give you a % chance to craft extra bullets.
---
Adding more plans to vendors is the best solution.  It benefits everyone.  Whereas adding it as a perk is an actual negative and not conducive to smart gameplay.
---
Even have bunch of screws and springs would be enough for me.
---
They can still salvage it in my opinion :P.
---
Weapon/prefix rebalances and a calculated power creep can fix armor and equipment when it comes to trading.
---
New content with higher level enemies such as Raids that give better resources for better gear (a different type of "flux" for a different type of power armor)
---
Have nuka cola give "damaged bottle caps" instead of regular ones. It isn't a significant source of income for anyone other than a cheater, so it is a negligble change.
---
Make all the absurdly rare plans/items like Marine Wetsuit Facemask more common after introducing new rare plans/outfits
---
Just a few things off the top of my head
---
Didn't realise you'd written this, but I agree 1000%
---
You being "almost positive" is interesting since they've admitted several times they don't have the tools to track or affect player actions or inventory.
---
&gt;Not that I feel like I need validation for helping someone 
---
Proceeds to write Reddit post about why (s)he deserves validation for helping someone. K bruh.
---
I'd drink a fifth of this
---
They dont have the software implemented to know who's doing what.
---
They can't even reset a character to a previous log in if a quest or something gets a game-breaking bug. 
---
DURDERVE!
---
Sounds like cancer
---
Yup... stolen goods would be seized and the economy is a micro verson if reality.
---
It’s not their fault 
---
How does the this trap work? 
---
I just tried shooting at a grafton monster with my furious handmade for a while. From the second shot onwards, his health dipped down a moment after the shot again, so he was taking two "hits" of damage, and that second hit was increasing in size after each shot. I also missed one shot and it continued giving the damage bonus immediately when I hit him again. By the time I killed it (having shot 15 rounds), each shot was doing significantly more damage than the first one
---
A workbench has to be close to an exterior window. Activate crafting or modify from the outside, and you'll teleport inside.
---
It is a bit unfortunate when we find people we can't communicate with, but I think it woulda ended okay in this instance. I still would have fast traveled out after getting my teeth smacked in and gone about my night, and they would have gone about theirs. No big deal! :)
---
actually it isnt just the elevator  
---
try checking the silo status holoband and you will see.  
---
the whole silos are disabled, because of some weird bug
---
I'll be there in a few min. 
---
This is a bad idea to add more useless perks to do something like this 
---
The only thing original about this game is the art and scorched concept. Everything else is taken directly from fallout 4 and literal skyrim
---
If you are posting just to tell other people that you find their posts annoying and to stop posting, please stop.
---
Or spoods is a duper making hum crash 
---
10 if you someone hasn't done the power quest, 100 if they have.
---
Yes, you can craft a single use water filter with dogwood bark, glowing fungus, and sitting else. But it's only a single use filter, so it's kind of a waste of time IMO
---
They out partying for the new yeae
---
Fuck that.
---
Only awful developers ban players for taking advantage of their mistakes.
---
 You can't fault someone for just playing the game in a way you didn't intend.
---
Fix the issue, but unless someone is modifying the game, leave bans out of it. 
---
That is absolute nonsense.
---
Data is stored server side so beth have total control to change player inventories.
---
Ya, I killed one with a banadana at the queen and stole it's helmet.
---
Felt kind of bad.
---
PvP happened in a PvP game. 
---
If you are commenting on a post to tell other people that you find their posts annoying and to stop posting, please stop.
---
I agree. Personally I wouldn't have any issue with it. I've restarted characters in Bethesda games probably hundreds of times now and also used to frequently play Rust which has regular server wipes. I've grown accustomed to starting fresh every now and then. However, not everyone is like me. I'd wager most people would hate losing all that progress. 
---
I support this but what sucks is the people who bought 5-10k caps worth of items without ever knowing they were duplicated. Punishing all for the mistakes of a few is not good either
---
The silos are down due to glitch or new years.
---
Melee is pretty OP by itself. If you have the right perks and mutations, you can one hit kill anyone
---
How is it overpowered then? I mean your comment contradicts itself.
---
"It’s overpowered. It would make it a mandatory perk."
---
"Adding a perk which could be fixed by plans just means you will lose 3 perk points."
---
since no one else said it i assume running is not sprinting but just the regular old walking pace. if its actually that and it if it works (havent tested it) then its useful for overencumbered looting.
---
It is broken temporarily. Follow updates more closely or just keep trying every once in a while. 
---
You're posts are annoying, please stop.
---
So 2000 round that probably good for about 5 minutes with the lmg. You need more like 20000 or 200000
---
Maybe some chems from the Raide..
---
Couldnt be arsed or its a policy to not do it... as they can do it and they are lying if they say otherwise
---
Top man thanks for letting me know of a fix so long after my post, will do this later when I log on
---
heatherlk doesn't exist btw
---
Wires are known to occupy some CAMP budget, so scrap those wires before you move!
---
That’s probably why I couldn’t launch one on New Year’s Eve 
---
The dupers already have the big bucks... some in the millions...
---
Naw man, you told everyone to shut up because you had proof.
---
Tod Howard appreciates every effort to protect him online btw.
---
I plan to try to launch my first one without using out of game resources, but will just use guides once I’ve launched my first. 
---
I assume the current issues are the reason I can’t even access a silo?  (I’ve completed all the quests up to this point and have the required rank). 
---
Awesome idea! Are you going to post a map with his route?
---
Yeah I've noticed, I see tons of xbox posts with two shot explosive weapons as low as 2000 caps. Didn't know that it went down to hundreds, but yeah it's very clearly having the biggest impact there
---
Edgy
---
Where's the fun in that?
---
175 is only 80c which isn't bad by any means but tells me you have either have poor thermal paste, a bad cooler or bad case cooling.
---
At least I have Bandolier!
---
Big guns really needs a buff though, the plasma gatling I assume has no damage falloff, unlike the other big guns
---
good luck getting that Nuke launched right now........   
---
xD
---
Ooo, I might have to try that.  I've pretty much stopped picking up syringers and ammo - looks like that might change.
---
It improves the server stability, which dupers wreck.
---
My hope for "weekly events" is that it will be special quests, similar to Protest March, but they are only up for a week, that way we don't get bogged down with doing the same shit over and over. No special rewards beyond the atoms and regular loot. Just new fun shit for us to do. 
---
Here Is the only solution that will work.
---
Increase weapon/armor lvl cap
---
Balance legendary effects big time 
---
Reduce all players caps to 2k
---
Implement item tracking
---
Any new duping method should be monitored and acted upon immediately even if it is a mothefucking holiday.
---
It's a really good game and the community is one of the best. I recommend watching some positive videos on YouTube. 
---
Or at least split the universe and let those of us who want to start new characters in a dupe-free environment.
---
that's some bullshit though about nuka cola. i haven't duped a single damn thing in this game, why do i gotta lose cap income from drinking nuka colas? i have perfected the art of finding nuka colas, and one of the great benefit is that every time you drink one, you get a free cap. i absolutely disagree with this.
---
Was just with her. 
---
That was the kind of thing I was hoping to encounter. I did do a lot of server hopping, visited blast zones and vendors and other places where players gather. It runs counter to my earlier experiences with the game for absolutely no one to respond.
---
I must have misread the stat then, thanks. I'm not sure if it does cap at 66%. Even though that's what the wiki says, increasing your strength past 15 does increase melee weapon damage but slowly has diminishing returns. Need some solid testing to say for a fact if any other stats actually cap out
---
HEATHERLK but lowercase? That's my best as a username so I'm not sure what it is
---
I have an anti-armor axe with perks to ignore 80% armor. You might as well just be wearing your vault suit. 
---
Plasma Gatling is great. It doesn’t last long at all compared to other heavy guns.  Once I got an explosive .50 cal, I stopped using all other heavy guns 
---
alright thank you so much
---
Theres no such glitches dude the problem is that the dmg is so high that range and accuracy doesnt matter
---
Yeah I'd burn my game disc if they did this. Not everyone has the time to re do the whole game because SOME people purposefully used a poor game mechanic. How is it a casual's fault they basically left a minting machine open?
---
On top of that I'm certain we've all inadvertently used a dupe glitch. I know I've given away and drunk way more purified waters than I've ever picked up.
---
The thing is this will be a self correcting issue. Without the need for risky meetups and exchanges people aren't going to pay ludicrous sums for TSE (IF the market even allows them for sale).
---
As much as it pains me to say the OP with his 8hrs a week probably isn't going to be able to run a very effective shop anyway. Who's going to pay for a Nukacola Quantum anyway? 
---
So someone over double your level / experience one shotted you and you think this is strange? Did you expect to go toe to toe with him in an epic battle or maybe even one shot him?
---
Melee is OP to a certain extent at present with certain builds, its a pvp game and you were trying to take his workshop. Probably a little shortsighted on your part more than anything else tbh.
---
There’s no contradiction, just because you lack the ability to grasp what I explained.
---
In simple terms:
---
The effect is overpowered. Meaning it becomes mandatory to have. Spending 3 points of perks makes it mandatory.
---
The % chance to learn increase mechanically is worth far in excess of 3 points.  
---
It’s a moot point, because it’s a dumb design decision, bloats the perk tree, and devalues the rarity of mods. 
---
This was last night.  I didn't launch them but the server I logged on had 2 zones overlapping prime.
---
I use low health rad rat build and oneshot everything. My DC gauntlet does 1200-1600 per hit depending on my health. Your PA gives around 500 DR and your health at level 35 would be below 300. Easily one shot. Always check the level of the workshop owner befor contesting
---
There’s a glitch to get through those damn lasers this whole time??
---
Oh. Capitals matter
---
Ya i make maps for a living so I will work on that soon it might take me a little while though
---
Read the edit kthx
---
It's because it's TSE, my friend found a TSE pump action and it 1-2 shots everything at most ranges.
---
The gatling makes up for its OPnees sometime by breaking in the middle of a very important fight
---
Thanks! In my opinion the punji boards and lowest level turrets aren't that effective against even the lowest level enemies. Even a lone level 3-5 anything (Mole Rat, Super Mutant, Dog, Ghoul, *etc.*) can take out a turret pretty easily (and as you said, yeah, they don't seem to engage when something's in melee range).
---
I really look forward to getting the perks to build the higher level defenses, though I probably won't start picking them up until well past 50 (this is my second/alternate character so I'm trying to be a little more specialized on him, while my main is the more general exploration/quality of life character &amp;mdash; in fact the only reason I have the metal security door plans are because I happened across them in a vendor on my alt, and meant to save them to transfer to my main through a friend, but accidentally learned them. Still kindof salty about that.)
---
Only for dupers? Nope! Another exploit would pop up after a while.
---
If 95%+ bugs and performance gets fixed? That would be OK, reset everything! 
---
[Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/xOGes0a)'s the current map as we know, I guess you can look on and see if it follows suit. Maybe it's somewhat randomized each time?
---
Also, I would suggest carrying a flare gun and shooting it up into the sky every so often to see if anybody wants to trade with him. I did that with the charleston vendor when I saw him
---
Mic?
---
I did. And thought that with level 65 I had a chance given that I would have the turrets to help me. Thought wrong I guess lol
---
Could be that they're just working on making sure they dont break more things while fixing issues. 
---
For real one of the evilest companies
---
Definitely not region locked though, you could easily play with other Americans, they may try to place people of the same region on the same servers, but I do not think they are restricted, otherwise I could never play with my mother and brother.
---
No it's all lower case I'm just using voice to text so that I can keep following him
---
Yeah i am, but playing alone so i m really going at a slow pace ! Thanks for your tip i’ll try this out.
---
Food crafting is another area where the game's systems tend to compete with themselves. Complex recipes are directly at odds with speedy spoilage and strict weight limits. Additionally, for me, at least, the real-time aspect of combat also tends to mean that you'll hoard "good" items longer (likely letting them spoil) because by the time you get a breather in combat, there's little combat left.
---
Yeah I got one. I hate playing without it
---
I believe they don't possess the means to detect what items are duped nor the will to do anything about. Even if they could, they likely wouldn't want to take a risk of bad press for implementing bans. There would very likely end up many people claiming to be wrongly banned and it would only tar Bethesda image. News of punishing exploiters would also not likely draw in new fans either. 
---
I'll be honest the fusion generator outputs so much juice that leaving my resource deposit isnt worth the hassel
---
I always wait for the first wave. Why build loads of shit spread out across the construction area when all you have to defend is the workshop desk? Stick a couple of turrets up high near the capture point and you're done.
---
Couldn't agree more.
---
Hop server 
---
Switch servers.
---
Jump servers.
---
Log off, log on. Different server means different robots. 
---
It does. Loads slower than a turtle shitting
---
Anything over 50 you gotta expect they've got their build sorted with a decent legendary weapon.
---
If youre wanted, you realistically should just die. Its the only way, unless you love the anxiety. Its only a matter of time before someone emerges from the ether to snipe you out.
---
Whenever I get a bounty I just start calling for the nearest player to put me out of my misery (unless its personal ;) )
---
&gt;and just relog if I'm dangerously low
---
Well that's why.
---
Some people don't like exploiting that bug, I guess.
---
(Not tryna talk shit, I do too.)
---
Except dupers are attacking you while racing or do you call the eqv of DDoSing servers just running your own race...
---
Or not, because that's a fucking terrible idea.
---
I've spent close to 300 hours in this game, and have never duped. I'm not restarting my character again.
---
Balance the weapons so the duped weapons aren't as in demand, and after the problem is fixed raise the level cap on weapons  and apparel in future update, rendering them obsolete.
---
That's how you solve that. Not calling for a do-ever for the entire playerbase because someone found an exploit.
---
I always turn and play the heart emote if they keep following. It's a decent substitute if I do that have my mic ready.
---
Yea they can actually from other players 
---
Just back out to the main menu and join a new world, then it should be all good ✌🏻
---
Mountainside is found shortly after entering the ash heap from the north I think it's at one of the northernmost air purifiers.. on the way up mount blair
---
Cool. Thanks for the help. 
---
Isn’t the Super Sledge a variant of the Sledgehammer ? Found a couple but haven’t used them yet (got a nice super sledge but i need to get 5 more levels).
---
You would probably want aluminum over steel, since steel will rust. 
---
Not saying he did this, but he could place the CAMP in a bush and hide some turrets nearby so when someone attacks they are fired on by thems
---
It does. Not worth it.
---
I have a friend that got the recipe for making punji boards.  Been looking for those for weeks.  So confused and jealous.
---
Well, it's been a while since they fixed something.
---
People are duping every night. Servers are disconnecting more than ever.. they didn't even reset the nuke codes this week.
---
Throughout playing my biggest annoyance is having to deal with rose. The way it is now I can just plug in a holotape and carry on scrounging. Feels much better than talking to an NPC which is basically a skinned bot. Why do people like NPC's so much? They're bloody annoying
---
dropped about 600 gunpowder and 70 bobbypins last night 
---
Shit weighs *so* much
---
All I know is that I want a true .50 AMR not that weak .50 reciever for the HR.
---
I feel what would help is if Bethesda changed the current passive mode to be fully passive. I'd like while in passive to prevent not only damage to other players but from other players, disable the ability to damage workshops, disable picking players locks and give the player a warning that they'll need to disengage passive to pick a players lock. to prevent people switching it back and forth during combat maybe a 2 minute cool down after coming out of passive before you can turn on passive again.
---
I paid 1500caps for a rifle from a user, I don’t think it was duped but how to know for sure? If they delete all duped items and I don’t get my caps back and the guy looses the caps he gained there will be a lot of unhappy results.
---
I hate to say it but all the items and data tracking to make everything right is looking like a huge burden 
---
r/Fo76, this community
---
I lost two jetpacks that way... if i had lost my cali shocks id have been really pissed.
---
I kind of randomly ran into him so I wasn't really prepared for this if I could have planned it I probably would have my system volume on right now broadcasting his ramblings on the voice chat 
---
but unfortunately my computer has some kind of bug wear if I'm playing with headphones in and unplug them it won't play sound out the speakers until I restart the game
---
Sorry man. If I didn't have family obligations I would have joined you. I logged off around 8 🙁
---
Also, the turrets won't attack the other player until they hit you or try and claim the workshop
---
How much for the two shot black powder pistol
---
Well i can find bats but i really want to be able to craft them, this way i can always make sure to craft the highest level available of the weapon. I got makeshift warrior lvl 3 today and am on ps4
---
The social players might have had other plans last night?
---
thanks for helping this newb
---
Fuck weapons in general

The damage calculations for Fallout 4.
---
I have one, a Medic’s. Has something else useless, like bash damage bonus or +1 PER.
---
Yup got a similar advice earlier, will give this a try
---
So what then? A mom and pop still survives IRL even though you have Walmart. Even at 20h per week you're still going to be dwarfed by 1)people able to play 16h a day 2)clans who farm. Same as any resource based survival game. 
---
I lost mine i think on missle turrets...
---
Props for making 'Pettable' a thing
---
and yeah I will compare what he does with whatever is on that map I'm getting the exact roads and everywhere he stops you so maybe that'll be useful like I don't know if it's randomize there anything but I thought it would be a good way to waste of what I'm getting a little bored with some of the quest so and I like his ramblings sorry this is all voice to text
---
I thought you could get jerpacks for other PA? I swore I saw people selling them...
---
Yeah I knew that. He started claiming it before he attacked me so he was definitely under fire. 
---
 While not perfect, many of the game's biggest bugs have been fixed. So I'm not sure what you are waiting for to make the game good. 
---
Human NPC's are never going to happen, nor is there going to be any meaningful role playing. 
---
That sucks, but it is never going to change. So all you can really to is look past it and play the game as is, or you can walk away from it.  Constantly complaining about it and talking about how terrible it is accomplishes nothing. 
---
What platform are you playing on and where are you playing from?  
---
I'm in NZ and playing on PC. "Server not responding" spam happens about once an hour, and I get disconnected probably two or three times a day. I'm on wired gigabit, and my PC is a high-end gaming rig.  
---
I don't have disconnection or latency issues with any other games, save for when MHW was first released and those issues *were* to do with the game and were eventually addressed.  
---
Just because you personally don't experience these issues doesn't mean you have permission to dismiss all reports of it.
---
You really think that?
---
You're crying about magazines and ammo?
---
The FO76 equivalent of crafting iron daggers in Skyrim.

Thanks but i m a on ps4. I can mod any i find, but i m just not able yet to craft the bat itself

I’m a nerd

---
When might the next update be?
---
Give us ammo scrapping or vending please god that would be so amazing I have so much 38 ammo to get rid of
---
I found a church with the rat poison and the corpses, but no holotape, or I missed it.
---
I think this lore is so fitting for a post apocalypse.
---
And ammunition be passed
---
1k
---
Yeah low level turrets do near no damage to me (lvl 114). I can stand there taking fire from 6 or more machine gun turrets and hardly take damage
---
As someone who wasn’t following any of the news I had no idea there were no npcs. I was very surprised when I got to flatwoods and didn’t find any people. Each time I went to a new town I was expecting to find an actual group of survivors, and occasional random raider ambushes, or random BoS fighting monsters or something on the road, or traveling merchants, especially since the first time I saw Grahm was fairly early. Same with my friends, it was decent amount of hours in before I realized there simply aren’t npcs aside from Grahm and the robots. So I would like them to add npcs or a town or something after they fix all the actual issues in the game. 
---
Who are you demanding communication from then if not the devs?
---
proof or just more speculation?
---
Na, the state of this game can not be blamed on the players. I can’t play much more than an hour at a time without a crash. Yesterday I lost a PA set after scrapping one of two frames in my inventory. Maybe I should have known about that issue by now but I shouldn’t have to look up every bug to keep my game from being ruined. That kind of shit should have never been in a game that launched at full price.
---
It’s pretty clear that the game was dropped as a cash grab and they will not make any major efforts to fix the game unless the Atomic Shop sales dip low enough. Even if the game was stable it has no end-game development so you will run out of fun stuff to do by level 70 or so. 
---
Tbh, about 80-90 of those were good hours. I've been losing more and more interest, so I'm taking a break to not let myself get too frustrated, is that really laughable?
---
I just saw that. Thanks for the info.
---
Yeah, I have those plans, and I have all the conduit junction boxes, but I don't have any pipes to connect the junction boxes
---
Admittedly, I did take perks for making food and hunger less of an issue pretty early on, but even at Rank 1, they make enough of a difference that I don't ever feel particularly rushed.
---
Foodstuffs don't spoil when you're offline.  I do think it's pretty funny, however, that they begin to spoil the minute you pick them up, considering that some have been sitting there for the last 25 years. 😋
---
I'd love suggestion #2 too, but I have a feeling its absence was probably some consolation for the AI and part of the reason why melee is somewhat overpowered, to compensate for having to deal with the game's copious mobs one enemy at a time.
---
Mole Miner blocking is irritating, but somewhere along the line I must have taken a perk that cuts through it, likely Incisor.
---
I Revenge of the Sixth this
---
Brilliant idea
---
I love to _glamp!_
---
Yeah their wording thus far on mods have been very careful to say its "unsupported" but mods that give an advantage and having cheat engine running can be bannable. I would normally say wait until they start supporting it but they have also said they probably arent going to be working on it until later this year.
---
I wouldnt use power patcher while on the go. Power armor breaks really slow anyway. I use first aid there instead, which I combine with field surgeon in charisma. So I use stim packs quite frequently, which means to me adamantium skeleton doesnt seem worth it.
---
Many people use blocker, so you can use it aswell if you like. But I prefer incisor. 
---
Overall this is all has been up to personal preference, BUT Marathoner doesnt work in power armor. Drop this card if you use PA. 
---
I found mine in Watoga. Phoenix had the plans. 
---
I doubt they’d ban the people that have traded duped stuff, just the people who have duped them.
---
I honestly didn't know what to expect. Thanks for your feedback though. 
---
I do fine with just a hazmat suit, but I have maxed AG, sneak, and escape artist - so I pretty much stay hidden or in a caution mode.  If I do get located I make like a banana.
---
Submit the replay and they can check the logs and take action if it is an issue
---
Sure it was from the queen herself? I've seen actual dogs (not mutant hounds) fighting alongside the queen, and I've got dog armor from them.
---
I play alone too, but you'll be 100 before you know it once you get into the groove. Just take your time and explore, man. If you're on PS4 I can play sometime. No mic tho unless I plug in my VR headset so not much company haha
---
Has anyone tried staying in the vault for 24 hours after making their character?
---
If you really feel that strongly about it can we get a way to organize legit players?
---
A sub forum, PS4 communities, anything? Peer pressure is the only tool we'll realistically have - asking Beth to do it is living in a dream land.
---
Also how would we attract new players to it? My other issue is with carrying so if a noob could post to find legit and within 10 levels players that would be pretty handy.
---
I'm waiting for the people currently defending the game to get bored (already started) and then see if Bethesda does a u-turn on their botched game philosophy or lets the game die. Then I can inform myself on if Starfield and TES:6 are worth buying. If Bethesda are going to stubbornly ignore customers and crap out money-grabbing rubbish then it helps to know beforehand.
---
Oh OK thanks for the insight! I made this really quick so I haven't put to much thought into it 
---
variable. there are big bitch stashes that will net you 300+ when buffed, but the little everyday stashes will pull in anywhere from 30-50 each when buffed.
---
Not that I know of... but I know what I’m trying out tonight lol.
---
I have some weapons I suspect are duped. I wouldnt be upset if they "poofed" as I have found legit weapons that are god rolls, it's not hard if you put in the time. Market is going to get flooded regardless of duping. I would rather duping not be a thing but damage is done.
---
There’s an issue with any nuka cola you drink. If you drink them too fast, you don’t get all the caps from them
---
That would make sense, unless food/drink crafting doesn't pass through the same logic.
---
I mean, they have something that works with breaking bulk down into the pieces you need.  Surely they can put something similar in to convert purified water to boiled and call it a day?
---
I have pacifist mode turned on simply because I dislike PVP and also because it's just not something I want to engage in, but one troll managed to take advantage of me doing a spray and pray with a horde of scorched all over me.
---
He attacked me, and while I was spraying out a fire hose of rounds at all my multiple scorched buddies, the game decided I'd returned his attack and set me to PVP mode, and since I already had 4-5 mobs still on me which weren't attacking him, I died pretty much immediately.
---
It's a stupid game mechanic.  
---
Ban is a little to harsh when the games not even a competitive game. On top that mods are comming to the game anyways and someone will just have a mod to get unlimited items. 
---
Yes it sucks that people are crashing the servers from duping but Baning people for a exploit that was in the game on release is a little much. Bethesda released this game half baked with so many issues and exploits. Of course there will be players who take advantage of the exploits. 
---
Can confirm, 13 int and 12 st reporting in with a fuckton of big guns in my pocket
---
Every comment says a different crop haha. Basically you just need to figure it out on your own. Test and test some more to find what works for you 
---
Everything you said makes sense, but that's not how any of it works. Pvp in this game is worse than dark souls.
---
Probably lag. I was discarding items, fast travelled and it was gone. It was there before I left, but so were other items I knew I had dropped.
---
I'm not really sure why you are defending a game not running properly on a platform it was released on. Bethesda (not Microsoft) chose to release Fallout 76 on the XBox One. If I buy a game for the XBox One I don't expect the prevailing troubleshooting response to be 'Bro just buy an XBox One X'.
---
I SO want the neon letters.
---
The simplest answer is that they just don't have any tools to view the data in any meaningful way.
---
Think about it, when you're using the console in FO4, especially with no mods or dlc, literally EVERYTHING is represented as hex code, but more importantly there are duplicate bits of hex code that refer to items or players or locations based on context or the called command.
---
Now take that and expand on it, every single item created by players or generated by events gets a unique ID, and that ID probably isn't based in any way in what it represents, so not only do you need to view each unique ID, you need to know what it is in the game world, and then know what player owns it, and how they obtained it. 
---
That's not even starting on establishing chain of custody. If the current owner of the weapon didn't dupe it, now you need to find the data on who traded it to them, etc.
---
Now here's the rub, the way people are duping is taking advantage of the servers, so who's to say that they can even tell if a specific weapon is duped? Depending on how the server is parsing information and assigning IDs it's possible that a new ID is assigned every time an item changes posession, but lets just say ALL of the duped handmades in existence are a copy of a single weapon that's been duped thousands of times, what do you do? Ban everyone with one? That'll probably hurt more people who aren't cheating than people who are. Remove then from inventories? That'll let cheaters keep their caps and take things from their victims.
---
Same as you but U.S. Although, I did notice something interesting today. So, I basically never DC. I also almost never bother with workshops. I have DC'd more today, at some point after taking a workshop, than I probably have for the life of the game. 
---
I'm not trying to use anecdotal evidence as a reason that there aren't issues. I'm sharing my experience just like the people that share their bad experiences. Surely you don't think you're issues are evidence that everyone is having problems right? Same thing. 
---
I believe it's Sutton that you are referring to. Idk if you can find multiple instances specifically of him, but his note does mention that he goes from place to place doing this so it would make sense
---
Because they produced a flawed mechanic with what was originally a super basic issue they should get banned?
---
You do realize that doing something like this without 1) compensating the people who have purchased items which they in all honesty may not know were duped 2)introducing a way to not prohibit the production of TSEs will create a bigger monster.
---
Look at the 1968 and 1986 machine-gun ban in the USA. It means what is effectively a $1000 gun retails for between $30 000-40 000. 
---
Tried this on acid node and it stopped my pump from collecting anything for over two hours
---
I have a feeling that a lot of instability issues are client based. This is not a new thing with online games. I can't tell you how many times when I played WoW that there were people complaining that the servers would be laggy or have constant disconnects, but everyone else would be fine. 
---
The bigger issue is the inability to rejoin your previous server. That is something I think they desperately need. 
---
I think we're stuck with the items. Chances are that most high level players have duped items that they bought with hard earned caps. 
---
Finding dupers is easy though. Hell I could log in right now and find one on any given server I bet. Seems like Bethesda doesn't have anyone actually playing the game.
---
This becomes painfully obvious to anyone that has tried multiple builds then hears that there is a "balance team".
---
They clearly don't play the game with the rest of us.
---
Publishers set release dates, not anyone who actually support the game after launch.
---
I definitely haven't had that problem with my junk pile.
---
Just get the cannibal perk and eat people!
---
I seventh this
---
What level? I find them all the time 
---
Only found the resistant VTU jumpsuit and the vault 76 jumpsuit plans, but never the plans for the resistant suit, sadly.
---
Thank you.  I was really lost there.
---
No, it's a separate class of melee weapons.
---
You can make rocket-powered Sledgehammers.  Generally, I believe the Sledgehammer outclasses the Super Sledge when it is given the right mods, but the legendary All Rise is one of the best melee weapons and it is a Super Sledge.
---
They have been making major efforts to fix it since it launched...
---
Right, who would want to treat people like actual human beings. No we need them to work on a video game because that's more important
---
The U.S. government cannot be trusted. Live free or die.
---
Some people think it is, some people think it isn't. 
---
Can the Two Shot the Dragon actually Two-Shot the Dragon? (Scorchbeast)
---
I m fine taking my time :) but i feel i miss some of the fun of fo76 by only playing by myself. I don’t have too much trouble as i ve got a “fair” amount of hours on fo4, and most of the mechanics are the same. But yeah shoot me your id and i ll add you :) don’t worry about the mic, got one but don’t use it so much 
---
You bought a TSE rifle? 95% chance it's duped.
---
Anything 45 and below
---
Thanks. It was an explosive shotty with additional damage for mutations. As dangerous to me as to the mobs, but man was it fun.
---
So much this. I have a pet deathclaw that I can't bear to part with, but I also don't want her attacking non-hostile visitors. Bethesda pls.
---
Probably never occurred to them that they might need to add something like this to begin with. Would not be surprised to find out someone or multiple people thought that no one in the player base would cheat because the game was so awesome  
---
Well yeah, I mean, I still think the dupers should 1000% be banned into oblivion. My solution is for all the duplicated bullshit they've saturated the game with. 
---
🤷🏽‍♂️
---
&gt; To play a singleplayer game, but with other people. Doesn't have to be an MMO to be a multiplayer game.
---
Would you honestly play this iteration of Fallout as a Singleplayer game? If you've played for a little while, know about the Scorchbeasts, the bugs, the quest loop, a lot of the games conflict being about workshops.
---
Do you think this would actually translate into a suitable single player experience? If Bethesda sold what 76 is as a Single Player experience to me, I still wouldn't buy it. The loop would get repetitive, the nukes and end-game is all supposed to be group based and without people in the world it would feel far too lonely.
---
I would make the game playable.
---
&gt; The reason I said they made a lot of improvements was to highlight how much progress they would still have to do.
---
Because your entire position literally hinges on the fact that they have made lots of improvements. And now you are saying that doesn't matter because the game is still a long way from good. Pretty sure I said that myself a while back. And now here you are, saying the game still needs improvement. Tell me, are you hating on it, or reporting on it?
---
&gt;Its start had a lot of problems and it made sense for articles to come out. However, its still getting them which just goes to show people are just hating to hate on it ,not to report on it.
---
It is still getting articles which are hate? But wait the game is still bad isn't it? You said yourself it needs more improvement. So why are these articles hate and not just reporting on the same fact that you are now stating? I ask again, are you hating on it by saying it still needs improvement? Or are you 'reporting' on it?
---
Thats how I got all the leather armor mods early game...  There were a LOT of dead brahmin in Flatwoods at that time of my life.
---
How much income are you really getting from colas
---
To the plaaaaaace, I beloooooong
---
I need to get this one, it’s from a quest right ?
---
I ate this 
---
Or he just has a two shot explosive and is hoping people feed him kills 
---
I think you’re pretty aware when anyone offers a TSE weapon for trade to you that its duped. Unless you’re totally naive anyways I which case you need a life lesson. Erase all the dupes and wipe duper’s accounts. 
---
YOU LEFT THE EMPTY TOILET PAPER ROLL IN THE BATHROOM FOR THE **LAST GODDAM TIME!** 
---
Haha Graham and I and Orion Just Killed a Scorch Beast near White Springs it was pretty fun
---
There is a switch in the game settings for controller. Did you turn that on? 
---
If you ban cheaters and dupers you're probably going to ban 1/2 of your playerbase and they likely will not repurchase.
---
Even if they havent cheated or duped, the chances are they possess items that were duped knowingly or not. So, uh, good luck?
---
my exact problem - thanks bunches guys! 
---
Some kind of vending machine would be such a good addition! Givesme reason to save certain items.
---
I didn't see it it's possible I passed over it... 
---
Who you call'n Pin Head?
---
Ah gotcha yeah I found the plans for just the normal VTU js never seen anyone wearing one but I know a lot of ppl were miffed that we couldn't pick um up.
---
damn that blows! that might be from scrapping your junk tho i know the game sometimes considers mods to be junk so it’ll scrap it. 
---
the things that disappeared were like my full power armor frames and lots of legendary weapons 
---
It's there, you have to scroll left or right in the power connector section.
---
Scratch that two Scorch Beast s
---
lol? There's plenty of legit ones out there...how do you think they are able to dupe? They need to get one first. There's also people who find one by themselves and then eventually sell it because they get bored of the game being too easy. Hell, I recently found my first two shot explosive, the dragon. 
---
Have the same. Cant get it to work.
---
There's a -50%  damage to players debuff that lasts like 30 RL hours if you continually attack someone's house.
---
Yeah gods forbid other people get to enjoy things because you don't want them
---
Longer yes. But not to bad. On PC, click to drink one dirty water, immediately spam the collect button during the animation. I get about 20 dirty waters a shot.
---
I have two TSE weapons I paid the same price for that could come from dupping.     
---
If I lose these as well as every other dupped item in the game I’d be a lot more happier honestly. 
---
Duppers should be banned but item they dispensed should remain
---
They can suck my cork.
---
Well, seven hours of looking for material and an hour of actually selling it sounds ok.  Even pro boxers only fight a few times a year at most.  
---
4-6 month wait 
---
Yeah damn those trolls doing things in the game. Why do they have to be so mean instead of handing out free crap and posting missed connections threads on reddit.
---
Bone hammer is in the game, but I also haven't seen those others
---
Ya? So it just keeps scaling weirdly after lvl 50? And is tied directly to lvl for some reason?
---
I can understand there being a scaling system for under 50, but I'd think it should basically be a plateau for scaling at or shortly after that point. I'm over 85, I just don't really fight people much, so I honestly don't know lol
---
On PC, at the well,  click to drink one dirty water, immediately spam the collect button during the animation. I get about 20 dirty waters a shot.
---
Vendors are also an issue.  Pretty common to see legendaries dumped off from god knows what.  If you buy that 3-star non-god roll sledge are you buying a castoff or did somebody go through the trouble of duping it because it was "good enough" and there?
---
That's not to mention consumables and junk.
---
Still, I'd think they could look at inventories and figure out who the obvious dupers are.  Nobody has 400 serum recipe plans.
---
My worst so far was spending 900 caps for something, but there’s definitely 5-10 low cost plans I doubled up on. 
---
Not that this excuses anything, but why are you running around with "3 hours of junk" anyway?  At no point did you pass by a train station to drop it off?  You don't find that inherently risky?
---
I'm not claiming my experiences carry more weight than anybody else's experiences, but I'm also not calling people who aren't having issues bullshit bandwagoners, either.  
---
You're being dismissive, and that's where my gripe lies.
---
I play xb1 and don't really run into any people that throw off the mood. Most everyone gives emotes back and will randomly drop what they are doing to go have fun for no real reason other than to just do it. 
---
Anti-armor explosive handmade, how much you askin?
---
Because it's so much easier to waste ammo rather than server hopping once and forgetting about it.
---
Not yet. The had to get them made. Customers got email saying 4 months.
---
thanks, will do.
---
But how would they know which is which, assuming they can even tell an item is duped in the first place 
---
I wouldn't mind a weekly event
---
Could be cool
---
Because customer support is not being honest with you. Techically, the Level 1 Support who's sending you FAQ copypastas does not have the power to do that; Bethesda most certainly does.
---
Home is where the meat is
---
I’ve seen this suggestion several times on this forum before but I think it’s still necessary to bring it up. It really should work that way in a game that wants to be realistic.
---
I have found a tame  / not hostile dog in the mire.  Was on top of a bluff near two skeletons with a dog dish and dog food.   Just need a way for him to follow me home.

It's one of the quests in Watoga, that's all I know.  I put off doing most quests until I got past Lv. 50.  I'll get to it eventually.
---
The regular gatling laser won't eat up too many of your cores because its base durability is pretty lack luster. I only really found it usable with high intelligence craft and double repair durability from weapon artisan perk. So unless you are walking around with power armor and 12 gatling lasers in your hotbar then you will still probably be maintaining cores. 
---
Not me, I'd be pumping out more atom shop stuff, top priority. But my items would be like a Mountain Dew sponsored long coat for 2000 atoms.
---
Fight or flight!
---
Yes, clearly there are legit ones, but based on the quantity I’ve seen I. 165 levels compared to the amount of people I see carrying them around I’m positive there are many times more duped ones than legit ones. If found 7 two shots with no additional mods and a single explosive gun.  Regardless, all duped should be erased, deleted.  All obvious duper’s should get account wipes as the most lenient option. I wouldn’t shed a tear if they are just outright banned. 
---
1: Give players the ability to rejoin last server within 10 mins.
---
2: Add vendor bots to CAMPS and allow players to toggle whether or not there CAMP is visible to others on the map
---
What about the explosive handmade?
---
Log out and log back in 
---
I will say yeah, I got it more often than not, any other event, I think it because it is the brotherhood events that have the higher chance.

Forza Horizon 4 runs like ass on my 5 year old Xbox One, I'm not bitching on their forums because it does. You know why? Because it's not Turn 10/Playground games' fault for releasing a game in 2018 for a console that was made in 2015.
---
Most people that actually play on Xbox/Playstation have upgraded to PS4 Pros or Xbox One Xs, there aren't many OG consoles still in use today.
---
I mainly play solo too and I really enjoy it. It is glitchy, the only one that really bugs me is server crashes at bad times but it doesn't stop me enjoying it, although I might change my mind when I get to the point I can launch nukes and find it crashes as I launch! I'd say make up your own mind,it can be bought pretty cheaply now. 
---
I hope that's true, but there have been actual gamebreaking issues that people have had here and not once did I see a post where they said bethesda was able to fix that for them
---
So you just run around killing whatever until you’re 50 ? Won’t the early quest be a chore or uninteresting when you steamroll everything ?
---
That's it! I couldn't remember the town's name. I was pretty excited when I found this new church. Hopefully there's more
---
Thumb down and move on
---
Have you seen the inside of the vaults? Most are all fucked up ain't nothing gonna be "alive" inside them.
---
also was it duped or is it legit
---
Definitely a fine substitute. I often play at night when I can't be on the mic anyways because my better half is sleeping so the heart emote is a great go-to.
---
No, that would be rebroadcasting of licensed works, and there is zero need for it.  Every device you own can play music.
---
Happy new year! Great to hear there's a roadmap coming, can't wait!
---
Can’t be disappointed when you got low expectation
---
This is why I don’t believe in hype
---
Except Cyberpunk 
---
I tamed a lvl 91 scorched deathclaw, it got reduced to lvl 21 when it went to my camp.
---
I also tamed a 50 mirelurk king, reduced to 30.
---
Watch inside the vault player bending is coming

Then you go to Winding path and find some Daddy-O next yo some blocks on a table that spells out "DRUGS".
---
It's a goddamn Fallout game! It literally is the furthest thing from a PvP game. Even story wise you're supposed to work together rebuilding. Assuming it's PvP just because it's multiplayer is the stupidest and griefiest thing ever, go back to actual PvP games you scum.
---
TLDW: It shows a .1ms clip of the ammo/medic vending machine you see at the train stations. nothing more.
---
In which case explosive two shot of just about any other weapon is better.
---
also the belch is incredible
---
&gt;Because it's not Turn 10/Playground games' fault for releasing a game in 2018 for a console that was made in 2015.
---
Yes it is.
---
Something similar just happened to my friend. He his game closed and when he loaded back in the quest was completely gone. Hope there is a way to fix this, otherwise this is bs.
---
Unacceptable?  It doesn’t require your acceptance.  It is what it is, but every developer interacts with their community the same way.
---
I wear my resistant one under my outfit. It counts as underarmor but also gives bonuses. :3
---
I agree to an extent. Bethesda fucked up with the glitches but I expected no less. Sure I experience them here and there but people act like the game is unplayable. I don't understand how having no NPCs makes the game meaningless when people dump thousands of hours into end game Fallout 4, making the NPCs feel stale after a while anyways. I have mixed feelings about it all. I'm unhappy with a lot, but I'm not so upset that I won't play it from time to time.
---
Omg I forgot that song existed.
---
Build your home around the dog 
---
It's a cool add in but honestly isnt the fusion reactor just so much easier.
---
Or they could fix the duping method?
---
Are we going to only be able to buy stuff from these machine?
---
You know that community managers can’t just make up answers and statements on their own, right?
---
Not sure. I found them east down the road from the jail, but I don't think they're always there.
---
Easy explanation would be no coordination between content teams since everyone working on this was new  rather than a member of the previous Fallout teams
---
Do events. They are al good for exp.
---
It'll suss itself out eventually.  Plans can be obsoleted and introduced inflation can wipeout or mitigate stockpiles of consumables.  Ammo will use itself eventually.
---
Anyone have a source for this?
---
I see the cycling as a way to create factions in different areas out of the real players. 
---
as if a group of people would work together to actually take over an entire region is a different subject altogether. .
---
Servers won't last that long
---
No, “ya’ll” not a colloquialism, it’s just a misspelled word. Lol
---
Beautiful Idea. I would really like to see this in the game: just to add on to your idea, there should be like a random terminal/notes added on, which basically details a short story, like what that survivor did, and how they died.
---
&gt; similar in to convert purified water to boiled and call it a day?
---
seriously, there is already a recipe for "boiled water" using two dirties and a log. just make another recipe for "boiled water" that is one purified and a log.
---
How much for TS dragon? 
---
Totally agree. For me the biggest problem is random spawns in the middle of my camp. I can't put turrets everywhere cause of the budget limit. Sometimes theyll even spawn under my foundation and I can't get to them without removing my flooring. Or walking away from my camp to fasttravel
---
A CAMP should become allowable to be marked as public or private and can show up on the map if set to public. Travel to a public CAMP could cost you but pay the CAMP a few caps.  
---
I've run into quite a few camps in populated areas but not so much in unpopulated areas.
---
The right weapon mods can turn a shotgun into a a sniper especially with explosive rounds.
---
Play the game. So much to do.. so easy to earn XP
---
Ooh, ooh, I thought about this one a lot! Here's how.
---
Every piece of GEAR in your inventory (weapons, armor, outfits) has a unique ID that's generated when the item drops. This has been true from Fallout 4 all the way back to Morrowind, and possibly earlier. When you dupe an item, both items have the same "unique" ID. They could absolutely take the game down for extended maintenance, check their database for duplicate item IDs, and delete every duplicate item.
---
But we're not done yet. If Bethesda were smart, they could have quite easily used your player ID to create a "fingerprint" that's part of an item's item ID; that way, every item you generate either by crafting, questing, or killing would have your fingerprint on it.
---
So if they did the thing where they check for dupes, they could do an additional step where they check the dupe's fingerprint against the player who's currently got the item. If a player is holding a dupe with a fingerprint different from their own, they had to have traded for that item and may not be a duper themselves. If, however, a player is holding an item bearing their fingerprint and identified as a dupe, then that player is very likely a duper. 
---
Once they've identified a duper, I'd say the ensuing ban should be commensurate with the offense. Only duped once? Week-long ban. Duped less than five times? See you in a month. Duped more than that? Good bye.
---
It feels so bad thinking about the piles of so-called “legendary” gear I’ve just had to drop because I couldn’t scrap it or even get anyone to take it. 
---
Bethesda also said they had no way to track dupers
---
Caft healing salve, just run around flatwoods river for plants, and morgantown airport have like 9 medical containers, use pharma-pharma on each and you will be good
---
I wonder if I just play Fallout differently than most? Because the vast majority of my hundreds of hours was sure as shit not spent talking, but exploring.
---
It is totally possible to make great stories without NPC's.
---
Look at Vault 11 from NV, or any other NV Vault.
---
Bethesda just needs to, y'know, get someone who knows how to write.
---
There are 4-5 different variants of the Mothman. They range in eye color, hostility, and a couple other things I can’t remember

Ah, damn. You guys remember that movie, BIG?

Thank you for confirming this. I'd assumed so, but forgot to double check whenever I repair it.

Lvl 240 and used many furious weapons, if the damage boost even works it's near nothing.
---
Ps4, the owner just left the game so now I'm running 
---
So you saw some people playing together and that made you suspicious? 
---
I'd report them. Especially that 180 player, he looks shifty.
---
If you could mention in your report that the servers are more fucky than normal and that nukes/Scorch beasts aren't working while you're at it, that would be fantastic.
---
I know this is an old post, but yeah that bugged me. 2 completely different things
---
Explore.  Then once its gets a buggy and freezes up, quit and play something else.
---
I think a good solution would be to put a cap on how much a player can carry (For example 2000). That way, you can only have 2600 total weight for your items (with stash) meaning it will force people with absurd amounts of items (most of which should be dupers looking to trade) to let go of most of their stuff. I suspect very few players are actually playing the game carrying more than 1000 on them. The ones doing that are most likely people cheating. That cap can be discussed and then the community would be informed 2 days before putting it into action. This would minimize the negative impact of cheaters and also wouldn't completely piss off the player-base (cheaters included).
---
I am having this issue as well. You find any solution?
---
No, they are coming in dry 
---
Or just sell it through a "third party" like the Whitesprings. Pass it to a vendor/box/whatever and you can find everyone's buy and sell orders on a terminal/new UI interface/whatever.  
---
No need to server hop, no need to crowd a whole bunch of people together to peddle wares over voice.
---
Use a stash box they can't be destroyed
---
Have you checked your 'stored' section? When I moved camp my vegetable plants duplicated in storage and I ended up with at least 500 extra plants I needed to scrap. I happened again the next time I logged in even though I hadn't stored anything else since scrapping them all. It was a weird glitch but I was able to sell all the materials from scrapping so that was nice.
---
Are you fucking kidding me? Their nuclear silos aren't Y2k compliant? My mom's computer was! Not kidding, it was advertised as being so and she ate it up like a sucker despite my protests. 
---
If you have an industrial water purifier you definitely live on a river or water source so it should take you literally no time at all to collect dirty water and boil it :/
---
Can we Lock items, and have that disable scrapping, trading, and dropping? In the single-player game, a one-button "throw on floor" with no confirmation was a lol. Now it's a loss. Rather than inserting X number of confirmation dialogs in several places,  it might be easier to implement a single Lock function that covers all of it.
---
The name is intuitive, it doesn't tie it to the Favorites wheel function (no need to secure my stimpacks...), saves a lot of grief. It's less to do with knowing the game, and simply a matter of most of the important function keys being close together and I'm a crap typist.
---
If they have a way to read player inventories, I think they should be really brutal and straight up ban anyone with over 1500~1000 of any item like a recipe or plan or other valuables. No questions asked
---
Remove pc locations to other players, private servers and offline mode. Add NPCs to certain areas, stabilize the servers, fix leveling jobs to the area not to the players in that area. 
---
Were you able to fix? I'm having this issue currently.
---
Ouch. Spit in your hand and rub it back there. That may help
---
I do, yes. They've made some mistakes, yes, but they're not compete idiots. And I'm going to assume they're full time workers, they'll be in. 
---
ive found it before, no idea from where though
---
Server hopping saved me, thank you!
---
Server wipe. I'm ready for beta to be over 
---
I'm almost sure players can crash the server. We somehow managed to have two PAs in one PA station. The moment I entered mine, our group got disconnected, assuming everyone else too. 
---
I really think we should get a system of having a separate set of "active" perks and "passive" QoL perks. Stuff like carry weight and looting efficiency should not take up the same space as lockpicking or damage. I'd even be fine if it was 50% or 75% of your SPECIAL allocation that was allowed for passive perks. At least that would give you more of a reason to get them in the later levels, since you won't be able to max out so many perks by the time you reach 50
---
&gt;A CAMP should become allowable to be marked as public or private and can show up on the map if set to public.
---
I agree but IMO it wouldn't solve the issues I'm talking about in this post.
---
Agreed! I've been fortunate enough to not experience any glitches myself. As of yet, I've really enjoyed the amount of voiced NPC engagements (including Mr Handy saying my name aloud), apposed to reading endless dialogue, as is the case with most MMOs
---
I built there on the dam on the far side by the hermit crab.  Have a 4x6 4 story tall castle, still fit in a garage door and a missle turret along with a full farm and a ton of purifiers.
---
1. My position dose not hinge on the fact its made progress. My point is that I'm tired of media circle jerking what they already said. Stop trying to say other wise i said several times that my point is that I'm tired of it getting circled jerked. Why don't you get that.
---
2. Second off the articles have already pointed out the many bugs and don't need to repeat themselves to prove a point of it not being complete. Its okay for articles to report on it but not to repeat themselves for free content.
---
Sidenote: Do you still not understand my point? I thought I made it clear about it being that articles circle jerking the game for content. Can you not understand it. Its okay to report that its buggy but its not okay to (or at least very creative) to keep making articles and videos about a game being buggy when it hasn't had time to over come the bugs it released with and expect them to be gone. I'm not saying its okay for them to release a half finished game but that still doesn't mean you should circle jerk it for content. Do you get my point now, it should be very clear now for you to comprehend.
---
The explosive effect doesn't suffer from damage drop off over range, it's what makes them so powerful.
---
I’m just saying it’s a decent idea. Teaming up in general is kind of an empty experience that I think needs a complete overhaul. This is just one idea that I think would encourage more people to team up with randoms.
---
I love playing the game solo or with close friends, but I think it’s worth discussing ideas that would make random team ups better.
---
I mean... it's pretty funny to have them melt someone's base.  You don't get a bounty and they'll never know it was you. 
---

Yeah and the worst part about that is if they do spawn in the ground and you can’t get to them, your settlement will be considered overrun.

---
Wouldn’t it be nice...
---
If we could wake up?
---
&gt; You have no way of knowing if an item you traded for was duped or not.
---
If you go to trade with someone and they have dozens of the same TSE weapons (something people have mentioned in this very subreddit), you have to be willfully ignorant to not realize something's fucky.
---
And the most effective way to undermine the market for duped items is to make people realize any duped item they have may just one day vanish.
---
The pvp lost its magic when double-shot weapons and explosives appeared 
---
I keep seeing the term "TSE" &amp;mdash; what does it stand for?
---
I tried to find every location on the map.  I suspect I've probably found at least 90% of the map, and most of the locations I'm missing are down in the southern end of the Cranberry Bog.
---
In the quests I did do, the tedious back-and-forth suggested that having a convenient network of fast travel locations was probably a good idea.  I do find the quest design irritating from this standpoint - they clearly weren't vetted by anyone who actually did the legwork of physically traveling from point A to point B.
---
The old-timey manufacturing standards of the Fallout universe means paint still has lead in it.  So yup, painted wooden blocks do indeed have enough lead to scrap.  So does any can full of paint.
---
Shame really. I only wanted speed demon and marsupial. Looks like I wasted three perk points. 
---
Power Substations like the Poseidon Power Substation PX-02 which is Southeast of Sutton which is East of Flatwoods, have a little Poseidon Power Box, you can build your C.A.M.P. close enough to place Power Connections and draw power from it. Provides 10 power alone and increases to 100 when the Poseidon Power Plant is repaired.
---
Can I get a location for workbenches ? Would be nice to have a map of where all workbenches are when I'm out and over encumbered.
---
The thing is they said "player vending" and in typical fanboi style everyone is immediately making assumptions about what is coming and when it doesn't meet those expectations people will be RAGING.
---
Two shot explosive. It’s the two perks that make the weapons so powerful. 
---
it has a good vibe to it while exploring, but since its an new mmo-ish game, it cant be nearly so fleshed out like a singleplayer game
---
thank you all 
---
Also, supply and demand is a thing. Prices being exorbitantly high at launch vs becoming more reasonable as more people have access to them is entirely expected.

Gunshots, screams, explosions.

PVP isn't negative it's the logical end game. Just like in Dark Souls it's boring to have 3 competent team mates unless there is also someone stalking you.
---
It confuses me that there isn't a big audience for something like this: 2 teams of 2 battle over each objective and area everywhere constantly all the time until level 50.
---
Level 5 workshop PVP. That's all you do - workshops and battling the other team. No legendaries.
---
The Most Dangerous Sport: 4 hunt 1 with no gear, or maybe 3 with no gear are hunted by 1 killer - Dead By Daylight style. There are endless iterations of this but it's like the community HATES doing anything but mindless grinding.
---
I agree that it would be nice to prevent this kind of thing from happening and to remove all duped items, but Bethesda will only be able to do the former. They have no way of tracking if an item was duped or not. They would have to wipe the entire game database and no one will like that option.
---
How do you find space to keep them? My stash is always too full.
---
It's just another copypasta from FO4 where everything that could be made has an ingredients list that it breaks down to. There is no good dagblasted reason for the vendor-only mods (which is a terrible system in any case) to be scrappable, but they had a lot of copy/pasting to do and didn't have time to apply logic to any of it ;P
---
I've found lights eat up budget nearly as bad as normal turrets, just keep that in mind.
---
Fair enough i get your point... i m also getting a bit tired of running around and teleport more often than i used to, which gets quite expensive

1500 caps
---
I can't see a reason for more than 10 honestly
---
They can ban dupers but not duped items. They have to basically stop the damage at a point but really cant do much to undo it.
---
As someone who also plays a certain popular GPS game where many people falsify their location and trade collection pieces to legit accounts, I’m all too familiar with the gray area of the damage already done.
---
I just found my first and I'm level 31. The *** legendary glowing ghoul was not keen to drop it. He even beat the crap out of a deathclaw at one point.
---
Wondering the same thing, tbh.
---
I 7 ate 9 this
---
If there is no way to look at logs and catch the dupers then a full reset is needed along with better long implementation to punish this in the future. I know that a reset will hurt legitimate players, but a full weapon rebalance is going to change a lot anyways. At least because of duping, we have seen what is definitely the most OP stuff.
---
And now we know the real reason Summersville Lake is empty.
---
1500 caps and no it isnt duped,  farm nuked golf course with my brother and cousins 
---
I think a lot of it has to do with players' computers. I was at Whitespring earlier. There were 5 scorchbeasts and the 200 fucking protectrons/Mr. Handy. That fight was absolutely stupid and I was watching other people (I think 9, may have been 8) come join getting disconnected left and right, but I got to stay for the whole thing.
---
Nice! Is the explosive effect on shotguns still super fun?
---
B-b-b-b-burn! ;)
---
Nuke fissure zone prime, I usually get 2-3 levels everytime that's done

It may not cap, but at that point the scaling sucks so much it may as well cap. Like the guide has a chart for points 1-15.

As you can see, after about 10 it increases by 1 point something every Int (you know it's point something since 12-13 increases by 2). So after 15 I'd expect like 1 or less from each point.
---
Melee damage is listed as 5% per level from strength though. It might have a cap but the return doesn't seem to diminish. In fact I looked at all the other stat's bonuses, all them are just flat per point. Scrapping is the only one that slows down as it approaches 15.
---
Teehee Whiterun
---
I would do 1200
---
I agree with this.  This game didn't become enjoyable until I stocked up on strength enhancing perks and legendary armor that reduces the weight of weapons, aid, and ammo.  Without power armor I have a near constant capacity of 300 +/- depending on the amount of health I have for unyielding and rads for bonus strength.  Even with calibrated shocks on both of my power armor legs, it's better to run around without it because I would be overencumbered otherwise.  I'm also at a point where I absolutely need to carry all of my melee and heavy weapons because the reduced perk weight doesn't apply to stash.  Just an even 1000 max for stash and some kind of reduction to rifles and I would be set.
---
They don’t support cross platform play right now. PS4 with only PS4, Xbox with only xbox and pc only with pc. 
---
Yeah, they're are all over the place. I walk by 7 of them just doing my daily vendor route, only 2 of them are usually already taken.
---
Isn’t the silos still down?
---
How are you getting 3000 rad resist from rad-x? 
---
I’ve been to the “real “ one.  I like this one better.
---
Oh that sucks! They need to add that to the list of stuff to fix.
---
Charisma, Hard Bargain, and drugs will affect the value of items.
---
Are you still following Graham?
---
I have mine next to 1 for the death law. Never knew about the power 
---
I'm going to blame my New year's hangover. :)
---
Idk
---
There is none because the truth is the employees are on holiday and we have a bunch of people just guessing
---
They do next to nothing to me and I'm only level 41. Granted, I have almost 350 damage and energy resistance so there's not a lot that does a significant amount of damage to me.
---
1.  Greatly increase the frequency of all events
---
2.  Invest in tech to remove stash limits.  They are dumb.
---
3.  Stop the vendor hop grind.  STUPID!
---
4.  Stabilize the servers disconn/crash/stutter.
---
5.  BUILD CAMERA *(^)#(^@)(%^(*@^y%
---
That's a good start.
---
For the love of all that is holy, fix the lever action rifle reloading bug!......please
---
Good god I need a faster way of levelling... or something to nerf the 100+ everywhere
---
At the bottom of the screen it'll tell you. It's called 'inspect'.
---
Let's be real, if the server kicks people out 3 times in an hour almost 2 months after initial release, I can guarantee people are getting pissed off and turning to another game. 4 of us were playing today and gave up after an hour and turned to RDR2. I love fallout and want 76 to as amazing as I think it can be. But updates and fixes need to happen quicker. I recon I would be at least another 40 to 50 hours into fallout 76 if the servers were stable and so would my friends. I wasn't even planning on buying RDR2 for a long time so I could enjoy 76 but it got too frustrating. 
---
Watoga high school, the monster mash event
---
Where? All the same problems are in the game except we have a larger camp budget and we can pick a server if the space is occupied. 
---
I’ve played solo 100% since beta, and will continue to do so, but I like that people are out there somewhere in the same map as me.
---
I assume it goes up to 5 because there are spaces for 5 stars. I haven't seen more than three.
---
Oh okay thanks.
---
Also: Ban the cheaters
---
Ooooooo yea! I forgot about that! Thanks man!
---
Agreed, give that doggie a home!
---
Go up to a flamethrower trap and spam disarm.
---
Should I wait for later levels so I get the all ride at level 50? 
---
Yeah the event was shit for me as well as everyone suddenly wanted to „explore“ for that picture frame instead of being together. And guess what you can explore more in limited time if you split up and rendezvous once found 
---
Sorry but this game has one counter intuitive design decision after another 
---
I love old school and bandstand music. I travel the Wasteland in silence because there are too few songs on repeat. Too many of them are from the previous game too. For an always online game they could easily put in a streaming service to keep the music fresh. Streaming music doesn't take much data. 
---
Can’t compete against players that dupe now, so sad. I think they should have their characters wiped.
---
And let’s not forget ballistic material. 
---
Very fun but still buggy like any Bethesda game. I feel the negative press was unwarranted, especially since it's the first time fallout has done the online rpg so can't expect perfection. Should be fun for months to come with more content they plan to add. 
---
Broken here
---
The boiled water helps add that extra flavor. Purified water is too bland
---
That post stated around 30k rr to be equivalent to just using pa or haz suit.
---
I wouldn't object to having human NPCs, but I do kind of like how Fallout 76 can be so direct sometimes.  It's little things, like how I don't have to wait for the robots to stop talking before the shop UI appears.  Or how the objectives advance the moment I start playing a holotape, instead of when it's done.
---
Like you say, you play a game for long enough and NPCs sometimes begin to feel like automatons anyway.  The same compliments, the same complaints, the same slow-ass "getting out of bed" animation.
---
I didn't see no elf pack. Only a Santa pack. Not only that, you are getting around 6 items. Now i would understand if each item was $20 each. Yes, it is misinformation as he stated each was $20 when only one was $20. Also, that is around a week with of farming of atoms to get those bundles. If you really have a problem with farming. Than I will feel bad if you ever play a monster hunter game
---
Yep, Baseballs are another one. Confused me until I realized they're a component for Baseball Grenades, so whomever was in charge of items that day put some thought into it and made them not autoscrap. Too bad he was on vacation the day they copied mods in :P
---
It's insane. I was excited to have hit the upper 70's and start taking over establishments. I would get one shot by 40's and it would take an entire Gatling clip to kill them. It was a nightmare.
---
I presume if we want our chicken extra crispy, we have to set off the nuke ourselves...
---
How certain are we that this is still the case? I'd love if they could trace that, but how do we know these IDs do not change when they exchange ownership? Or that they didn't transition to a different system altogether to conserve server space?
---
Came to say the same thing. I carry 4 tops... but I don’t relog when I’m running low, that resets it? Good to know.
---
what about treetops south of Harpers? it spawns either a sloth scorched or normal, 2 glowing honey beasts,  2 glowing snallygasters, or 2 bloodbugs 
---
not sure if this counts as random but could be a good place to get a sloth
---
Not sure if you can launch right now 
---
I was one of the people involved on the receiving end.    I don’t really know what the police would or could do, but the possible psn ban/doxing that I was threatened with for playing legit and then getting pissed should be met with some Bethesda action.  I did speak to them in a party I don’t think 12 probably 15-16.  
---
I would rather hear complaints than “I am bored; guess I will troll the lower leveled players”
---
Not just buffs but debuffs as well.
---
I'd be happy if the game didn't crash every half hour.
---
Same here, at Whitesprings. Typical that those bastards still manage to find me when the fissures are closed! 
---
But not as good as a few weeks ago, before they nerfed the event XP rewards across the board for no reason. 
---
Timed events like Guided Meditation are still decent events to farm though, as you can complete a lot of them without even firing a shot.
---
I use a bloodied explosive 50cal and bloodied gat gun. You don't need to manage rads just manage hp, I sit at about 20 to 30 percent hp and do fine while my 50cal hits 600+ damage per shot with stacked perks.
---
Thanks Bethesda!! 🤷🤷
---
Beth, plz, make everything bad gone and everything good better.
---
I just found a flamer plan in the safe at the camp venture armory, I'm level 146 if that matters
---
Been there done that mid blast zone. Server hop resets the quo. 
---
Dear god, war has changed 
---
Pro tip: stop reading the forums now while you're ahead!
---
Note the locations of firecap shrooms - they're super handy.
---
Workshops are PVP areas - don't complain if you accidentally shoot something and get wanted that's just an opportunity to role play a raider!
---
Often cheaper to make new armor than repair the old stuff.
---
You don't need more than 2 weapons / ammo type don't hoard just toss it and keep moving!
---
Always sort armor by weight and food by spoils and click L3 on your cook station to organize by cookable!
---
Addiction is negligible - Beth wants you to do drugs, kids!
---
 Disconnects are all too frequent so make sure to friend up ASAP.
---
For your CAMP there are about 100 resources nodes across the map that you can auto extract at without needing a shop. There is even a player made map of all locations.
---
Don't waste your time with water pump buildable item - just use rivers much faster.
---
...and the #1 tip most players forget - role play and use your imagination!
---
Well, I wasn't expecting a post today, so that was pleasant surprise. 
---
 **Player Vending** = even faster way to reach the cap cap 
---
There's a terminal entry that explains the Commendation system, actually.
---
\- Killing a bigbad will sometimes win you one, but this is unreliable and slow
---
\- From now on, your game's map will show events that start "Enclave: eventname." Do those, generally two commendations each. You have to mouseover an event to know what it is, they don't look any different than the normal events.
---
any chance youd be willing to hold onto it til tomo for me?  I could grind the caps by then
---
Could be mistaken but that could be from some responder.
---
I can confirm this. Found it randomly in a floor safe in Grafton.
---
If you aren't happy with PvP then don't play PvP games. This is absolutely a PvP game. 
---
Oh no :(
---
It actually skips you from the start to the end. You skip the whole silo.
---
Massive balance patches
---
Maybe if you're red but if youre not just block them. It's a big ass map and if they cant see your dot they cant find you.
---
Thanks 👍🏽
---
it goes after mods before bulk.  Not joking.   That's how absolutely stupid BGS is.
---
Sold, Psn is SirGimps
---
Ya okay, that's certainly imbalanced. Does it even out better between players over 50? Like a lvl 90 vs lvl 120? Because then maybe it has to do with sheltering the Players who haven't hit Soft Cap from Players who have.
---
FYI if you click (A) on the controller in the image before screenshooting it you can hide the ui. I always do this when uploading to twitter
---
I can walk out my door and see John Amos, I think its a tad bigger in real life but it is damn near what it looks like.
---
Are there development notes stating there are going to be player vendors somewhere? Couldn't find any while googling.
---
Careful, the wallflowers will get extremely angry with you for suggesting that you don't need 96 hours of server hopping and 3 alts.....
---
I'm used to it. ;)
---
yes but it's getting tougher because I didn't bring any food or anything with me and all of my weapons are broken now so I'm having a blast
---
Why not fast travel? 
---
You know, I agree with ya’.  I don’t have a lot of complaints, but all the QoL perks seem easy to overrun your build if you let them.  Which would be fine, but it feels like the things you’re using them to overcome are obstacles put in the game as an excuse for the perks.  
---
I don’t know about everyone else, but I barely use any, because I need all the perks pertaining to my build (melee).  Not to mention, the QoL perks, while okay, aren’t great enough to offset what you miss out on, and with a bit of elbow grease, become pointless anyhow.
---
The mistress of mystery quest is good for xp, and you get a great melee weapon from it. I find tho the best way to level up is going to the nuke blast sites :) 
---
Bloodied explosive gets my 50 cal to 600+ damage per shot
---
Shhh, stop taking my spot. Keep getting told my base can't be placed
---
Have it, no idea where I got it though
---
Do you sprint a lot / use jetpack a lot? Those eat core juice. I rarely burn through a full core in a nuke zone before I need to leave and unload. Myabe I just have a low carry limit... 🤔
---
I'm assuming with DLCs it is going to be similar to the other Fallouts where you go somewhere in the main map and then it loads you into an entirely new area. In these cases, maybe your CAMP will just pack up or it is saved per area (probably harder to implement).
---
Finally got one earlier. The protect the robots next to watoga. Got 1 for it. Found no scorchbeasts now i actually want to go against them.
---
I actually discovered that but forgot to re do it. 
---
I did it with the other 2.
---
I agree, broadly, but I also feel there are some outlier Perks that happen to be major offenders.  Makeshift Warrior (and others like it) is definitely one of them.  3 is a pretty baseline number, but some could really do with 2.  The difference between 5% and 10% is so inconsequential that you don't feel like you're stronger for having taken the perk.
---
But purified water doesn't have rads, boiled does.
---
Except for the beta, I've played this game solo. So yes. Except for the lack of conversations with npcs it feels like a big Fallout 4 expansion, imho. And I play it like that. 
---
Lvl 80 and only been in a single workshop conflict so far, and that part seemed useless, unbalanced and unfair. So I can understand why pvp'ers complain. But i don't play for the pvp.
---
And once everything is explored, i will most likely put away the game. Like I've done with both Skyrim and Fallout 4. No endgaming. No grinding. Maybe pick it up if someone i know want to play it coop.
---
Hey my GT is Omega Orochi if you're still available. Hope you enjoyed your New Year
---
It still haunts me that you think trolling for downvotes should somehow garner upvotes. I wanted you to know that.
---
what about buying something from someone with one item that he MAY have just pulled from his mule account? 
---
Lol. Yeah it’s really useful
---
You must not use VATS..
---
Does anyone think they will ever somehow introduce human NCPs?
---
Im not trying to be a jerk, but I'm an industry vet of over 25 years, and what it looks like to me is that they're either taking a nap, too burnt out and don't care, or they're completely inept.
---
Servers dropping consistently, game crashing when you add a friend and try to meet them, duping out of control, drunken balance that would be fixed by playing the game for a couple of hours and tweaking a spreadsheet value.
---
If they're not on an extended vacation, then it's worse than I think.
---
10 is just too many Im sorry everyone I let you down
---
Can't get armor piercing and furious together.
---
Tons of posts on this all day
---
I've kept my camp in that spot since i was able to survive the bog, always thought of it as my secret spot that nobody else would think of
---
If you are replying on a comment on a post to tell other people that you find their comments and or posts annoying and to stop  commenting/posting, please stop (is this funny yet?)
---
My partners camp was close and I was over encumbered 
---
Servers aren't kicking me off three times an hour. It's not happening to everyone. 
---
So you are saying they should host private servers for solo players for free?  Increase their server costs x24?
---
I'd rather a option to make boiled water collectors - like maybe a rain catcher that boils the water  
---
has same storage of powered collector but can be placed anywhere like on roofs and only needs 1 power (since its only powering a burner) 
---
this would allow for automated boiled water collection and some more camp options for people who like to build more on rocky areas 
---
It's your fault for letting them get to you lmao. I do this because there's nothing else to do so I just fuck with other people. What's wrong with that?
---
30 bobby pins weigh as much as a missile.
---
Let us ponder Bethesdamath together 🤔
---
Same as the FO4 artillery. When you place it a chest appears with 10x smoke grenades. Lob them at a target and eventually the gun fires and brackets the smoke grenade.
---
2 things. 1)when thrown the grenade stops its arc and drops straight down as soon as the  smoke ignites. This can milit the range. 2) the guns have a very short range. 
---
Thats a retarded solution. 
---
Wow it's taking us an hour to get from Charleston to the train yard north of white Springs
---
They can.
---
There's a perk for it I think?
---
Friend of mine was able to walk into a nuke zone just by popping Rad X without any trouble without power armour. Whereas I got 16 rad/sec even with Rad X and a Glowing Blood pack combined trying to follow him.
---
There's also leadlined mods for basically everything, though you have to tradeoff the almighty pockets.
---
Yeah the first one if my favourite the contrast with the light of the sun creating a shadow on your character makes it feel like you are in a special place
---
I would accept this approach even.  When I'm cooking I filter craftable recipes anyway.
---
I'm more disappointed in the amount that I paid for what I got, $30 at the most and I would be okay.  But with these online games, you gotta buy it on day one so your friends don't leave you behind. 
---
yea but that's not going to happen now is it? the answer to that question doesn't matter when the chances of it actually happening are very nearly zero, in a perfect world we the consumers *would* (and should) wield that kind of power; maybe it used to work that way but it certainly doesn't anymore, and that's a very fundamental and systemic issue with the system itself that's not going away anytime soon
---
I think a lot of issues are because of cheaters crashing the servers. I noticed that the server will start lagging and eventually a disconnect happens. Also I notice this happens when there are people gathered in weird spots on the maps (cheaters?). But yeah I'm looking forward to that ban wave and the subsequent "I didn't cheat" posts.
---
Keep an eye out for hazmat suits and then nuke zones at the whitespring. 
---
Tag things with a ranged weapon and either run the resulting pissed off glowing things to the guards or high level players.
---
Good for 5+ levels in under 30 minutes.
---
I'd just go for the dupers and ignore the copies 
---
and yeah its not hard to find out who dupers are I've had something like 5 walk up to me and ask to trade and have 3-4 of each legend in their inventory
---
damn, just damn
---
I got exactly what I was told I was getting. You're the dipshit that didn't know what the game was and jumped on the crybaby bandwagon so you could fit in
---
I can help follow him and take note of where he’s going, so you can port back to your camp to resupply first.

---
I gotta get you alone in the mine some day   
---
I can't hold on but I can't let go  
---
And I can't say yes I can't say 'no' 
---
remove beach boys and Butcher Pete since you don't have part two (IMO)
---
Was this implemented in a patch?
---
Enough, thing is, who really cares if once they fix it, the dupers have 15000 caps or something, that doesnt really equal much in the way of buying power in all honestly, maybe a few days worth of cap collecting for a hanful of purchases
---
Hoping that in the patch(es) before player vending they fix the duping exploit, confirm it is actually fixed, and raise the max level of weapons from 50 to 65 or 75 to really fuck over the dupers. 
---
-Anyone possessing more than 50 of any serum should be instantly banned or have their account reset.
---
-Anyone possessing more than 3 of the same exact 3 star legendary items should be instantly banned or have their account reset.
---
-Anyone other server side way to detect those who have duped items should be utilized and all offenders should have their accounts reset.
---
Depends what you want them for. Adhesive farm is tato, corn and mutfruit. Have razorgrain if you want the brahmin pen at some point. I like melons because they're a quick and easy way to get food and water with no cooking, otherwise corn soup and razorgrain soup do the same once cooked. I have everything except gourds and carrots at my farm, but only because I ran out of space for them. 
---
If you want to pick up a load of vegetables for planting there's a vegetable patch at the edge of Morgantown airport. 
---
Heck yes!
---
I jumped up and did some looking around, saw the sun and the background. Was like shit this is a must.
---
This perk in liege with Bear Arms is incredible, carrying a 2 shot gatling gun where with 2 Bandolier makes 5mm weightless and the gun itself w pounds.
---
If Gatling Lasers can be edited to be the same effectiveness as the Ballistic counterpart it'll be the best tank/dam endgame.
---
Currently i dub this the Bastion build. 
---
&gt; They have been making major efforts to fix it since it launched...
---
except not really, right?  They haven't done jack.  This is the new BGS.
---
Are you talking about the glitch through the roof deal?
---
oh no, not those :/   :D
---
Lmao
---
So is this fixed now? Tempted to buy but won’t if still bugged? I only have the marsupial perk from rads with starched. 
---
Yes. Nothing against them, but it's necessary to make the game better.
---
How do you use one of your characters as stash?
---
Like, do you drop everything and rejoin on the same server with another character and stash it all?
---
Only way to identify dupers is people with absurd amounts of weight. Im talking 100,000 pounds plus. 
---
I just got Disconnected from server 😡
---
What has been described is trivial to script using inventory filter events with the item baseid and unique refid. Attaching the scripts to players should be simple using dynamic quest aliases. 
---
Fallout 76 scripts are similar to Fallout 4, so a decent mod scripter could have that tested and published in a couple of hours ... if the Creation Kit was actually published.
---
\*Turns the record over\*
---
I only have 1 explosive weapon which is my troubleshooters explosive the dragon which I found for sale at a vendor
---
Very unlikely that they can even do that.
---
I think the best thing we can realistically hope for is that Bethesda skims over player inventories, finds people with obscene amounts of items that are not in any way acquired reasonably in such quantities, and smack those people with the banhammer.
---
There has been a series of massively abused exploits that no one ever seemed to have gotten in trouble for. I can fully understand why cheaters will the confidence to dupe hundreds of rare items as there is no precedent of people getting punished for such actions. We need people getting banned to set that precedent and send that message.
---
That does not look like a happy house hold, but still better than living next to a coal mine!
---
In game lore Poseidon is also the Corporation on that last oil rig that the Enclave is using.
---
[This high def. pic] (https://images7.alphacoders.com/932/thumb-1920-932623.jpg) maybe shows it from more of the same angle as your in game pic - your character practically standing in the canal as far as i can see.
---
Some of the other pics show the tailings pond and torn earth nearby on google image.
---
I'd rather scrapper be made 1-3 levels with +10% chance to learn a mod 1% chance to learn the weapon or item 
---
Scrapper lvl 1 Bonus resources tier 1+ 10% mod +1% Weapon Chance  
---
Scrapper lvl 2 Bonus resources tier 2 +20% mod + 3% Weapon chance  
---
Scrapper lvl 3 Bonus resources tier 3 + 30% mod + 5% weapon chance
---
would expand on scrapper to make it more useful and give more options then just server hoping to learn plans for random items   
---
Probably find some way to balance explosive and melee weapons.
---
if a "legendary" weapon isn't useful, what makes it so legendary?
---
I declare this comment is LEGENDARY
---
See, that's what it's like
---
Thanks! I'll add ya when I get on 
---
Oh man anyone who joined you previously still in that server? =(
---
I’m furious. I would have built down the river from where I’m at and saved a shitload of my budget. I built a sort of underground bunker in a ravine and have like 6 medium generators in the basement. It’s dope. 
---
i said this before: scrap all legendary weapons and armor item codes(mod codes) and generate new ones for every one of them.
---
and all prior duped weapons/armor are now obsolete.
---
giving ppl a fair chance again.(and on a sidenote:add two shot and explosive trait to the same mod tier)
---
do I need to joint the event but not do it, in order to have strangler blooms spawn? because now there is the event, but i still dont see the blooms
---
I think there should be a room in white springs with areas we can rent a mr handy or vendor station to sell to each other  
---
Did you ever figure this out?
---
Maybe they meant “Player venting” as in a machine to make players RAGE 
---
roleplaying as a trader was never going to work in this game... again bethesda has no way to ban dupers as there isnt any anticheat or an ai to scan players inventories.
---
This was my biggest complaint in FO4 and I was really disappointed to see they carried the problem into 76...
---

---
a couple of points to note 
---
* adrenaline and tenderizer isn't worth investing more than a point in
---
* stimpaks are very common and limbs don't get crippled often enough to justify 3 points (i'd recommend either solar powered, radicool, rejuvenated or cola nut instead)
---
* don't fully commit to the weapon perk cards you will get more damage out of 1 level of this and incisor (my build uses travelling pharmacy mainly because I run around with 500 stimpaks and 100 psychobuff on me)
---
I find the whole boiled water business too much of a chore. Press x, watch animation, wait for delayed response from game, press x, watch animation, wait for response...
---
So is lakeside cabins
---
I'd love several items from morgantown airport those pop tents being one - the cargo containers being 2 - and quonset hut being 3 
---
I do to, and I love 76 solo, but that doesn't refute his points, because they are correct.  FO76 is a great quest/coop fallout, with almost no thought put into the tacked on multiplayer side.
---
How much damage can you do?
---
Not been in one myself, however as it is as yet unreleased content who knows what will be inside.
---
Hoping for some NPC's is a long shot I appreciate, but hopefully Bethesda had been listening to feedback and will eventually put some NPC's in the game.
---
Been there. Dropped like 250 copper to my boyfriend to help him make something for me. Totally disappeared. I was so annoyed.
---
Black Titanium or whatever works as well
---
Well I am pleased for you, but it is clearly happening to a lot of people and that is a serious issue for maintaining players. 
---
Just scope around areas, look for places where what you want can be built. If you want a true camping experience find a rock in a hill and set it up there if you want to build a proper home try to find flat ground wiht scenery you like but whatever you do please don’t build on roads.. btw don’t forget to make blueprints if you do build a proper house so you can quickly place it.
---
It only fires one extra pellet not double. That's why most 2 shot explosives for shotguns aren't great.
---
&gt; Reduce all players caps to 2k
---
I do not see this as a good solution since most plans cost 1100 caps, that will limit you to 1 plan before having to go and get more caps.  
---
Maybe reset everyones caps to 2000 so everyones who wasnt cheating gets some free caps (most likely) and people who were cheating lose out on probably thousands
---
Following up to let everyone know that the current plan is for a hotfix to be deployed sometime tomorrow to correct this issue. Once i have more information on timing I'll reply here.
---
Is nuke cherry better than normal ?
---
Here's a more reasonable post that makes sense, you're completely right but there seems to be a change in the consumers. More and more people are against microtransactions and consumers no longer buy products they know are crap (just look at the low sales of FO76). This will force the company to change the way they handle future products, they'd be incredibly stupid to ignore the low sales figures and carry on the way they're going.
---
Unless you're making your own buzz blade, because that gives a very high initial durability (means high initial damage).
---
being an actual empath i have to say.. being with another actual empath is very OP..  
---
(since being an empath causes you to be oblivious to your own problems having another with you is.. too good)  
---
Thank you for the update.
---
I want both, so I can choose.
---
There's more to come.  Bethesda mentioned they're opening a couple vaults 
---
I'd say the people with 1500 of many items are probably dupers.
---
Theres tons of videos on yt of both people going inside and the backstory
---
I'm not sure how to tell but I think we were all booted because someone added me to a team and it said I was the leader now when I logged back in
---

As long as players cant set prices way too high I'm fine with it. There are going to those who want to show off their e-peen and set all 1000 of their 2SE weapons for 999999 caps. There needs to be some sort of price regulation or it's just gonna be a bunch of overpriced auction houses dotting the wasteland instead of players selling to each other.
---
personally I go and get popcorn then put a unholy amount into my mouth and crunch slowly and loudly into my mic 
---
singing loudly and off key is great to 
---
More then anything I wonder how the quality will be 
---
Anyone paying real life money for an in game weapon is a fucking 'tard. Micro transactions are bad enough but paying a 3rd party? Fuck no.
---
As for a wipe, double fuck no. I've put every available minute I have into this game. A wipe would be a serious "we don't care about you" and will be a death knell for FO76 and any Bethesda game from many people's opinion. 
---
all other vaults are closed for now, there are little infos here and there about them, but nothing much, yet
---
Hold up. Pet sloth?
---
I bought the nuka cola stash box haha. Did a few challenges &amp; with what was left I just bought the vault tech seat today. Eyeing up either the glowing map or the vault tech canopy next
---
I don't care what metal you choose, making screws would be sweet.
---
Lol, I love it!
---
All other vaults are sealed. No way in and no way out
---
Or dropped on the ground because the trade window is horrible 
---
First everyone blamed storage glitch for server instability, then it was infinite weight glitch and now that those two were pretty much fixed people ate blaming the supers. Maybe just maybe, the servers are junk and that's the real reason 
---
If in those 8 hours he finds some sick armour or weapons and thinks "i could sell these" he would be able to instead of having those same items being duped by others and given out for free because they have 12000 of them and they arent rare any more
---
It's a fallout game with pvp aspects *purposely put in*. 
---
It isn't "literally the farthest thing from a pvp game". it is a pve game with pvp aspects (more akin to dark souls than rust/etc). 
---
&gt; Even story wise you're supposed to work together rebuilding.
---
*Supposed.* Like how all everyone (BOS/responders/etc) was supposed to work together against the scorched **but they didn't**. 
---
Lorewise, people (hence players) are meant to be *everything*, including raiders who kill (for their fun or your loot).  
---
What is an RPG if you only have paragon options?
---
Not to mention the cards are stacked against renegades, with slap protection, block functions, global omniscient bounty system and removal of slap protection and player locations when wanted. In a stick and carrot scenario, the only things driving pkers are loot and   salt.
---
Having renegade aspects in a multiplayer game adds conflict hence content. What's the point of playing as a brotherhood of steel paladin if there's no true evil to crush?
---
It might change slightly as people place camps for what resources they can get themselves or a good fast travel point for what they currently want to do.
---
Depending on how player venders work it could become a reason to place camps in more trafficed areas and make them more than just a platform for crafting tables to attract people.
---
76 is the prime target for the troll brigades...
---
Fair enough, me too, I will be looking, if I find them I will let you know. if you could do the same.
---
Servers without TSE's would be nice.
---
What’s the deal with the boards?
---
yes. just like irl if you purchase stolen property
---
This solution would destroy any legitimate traders mule character.  Also any legitimate hoarders mule character.  Due to the small stash limit offloading an excessive amount of extra ammo, junk, weapons, apparel, etc to be held on a mule character is pretty common.  This is, after all, a game that encourages hoarding/collecting.
---
Can you imagine the backlash that would occur if legitimate characters accounts were cleared this way?
---
Yeah it’s because the turrets are useless about 75% of the time. They just sit there and not target the enemies. I was just defending my base against mole rats and I’m witnessing my turrets doing nothing when the enemies are literally right in front of it 
---
Psst forgot system 
---
Except when every trader literally has zero caps.  I try to buy stuff (for big caps), then have the system cut it all back to 200.  Then sell some stuff and most of the caps disappear again!  And no, there are no others around sucking my caps away.  My stash keeps getting smaller when I trade now.  Something got nerf'd recently.
---
Is noticed the word you’re looking for?
---
Can you not change pistols to rifles by changing the stock like in 4?
---
start shooting enemies point blank in the face!!!
---
That's what I meant, never mentioned a cap cap reduction 
---
And it wouldn't include giving players with less than 2k the difference to get them to 2k
---
😂
---
Dang!  I better get on making some dupes instead of exploring. 
---
Ahh that sucks =( thank you for following and recording his path. I’m sure what you have gathered so far could still be useful for people who’re trying to find him!
---
I highly recommend building next to a mineral deposit, that way you can farm minerals of your choice to sell and have a nice camp somewhere. 
---
i did not test the ultracite either
---
You are seriously lucky.  I have failed the so much for legendaries and checked stashes before starting every time and never see them
---
Block avoids their servers too?  This is news!
---
I think Bethesda realized that solo players duping require another account.  So the average duper has paid for two games which Bethesda may feel is super awesome to their sales numbers. This may be a reason why they may be feet dragging on a solution.  Limit any item in inventory to a low number besides regular ammo. And it wont be worth logging in and out dozens of times for a small amount of legendaries to sell. 
---
I do play entirely in PA, and I also hardly ever run one down to zero because I usually get disconnected before that happens and the core gets recharged to 100 when logging back in.  I assume that is a bug and not a feature, and when that gets changed I expect to go through more cores. 
---
ah right fair one, I miss read it as capping people off at 2k caps
---
I found the quest reading the note in Fort Defiance on one of the floors from the elevator. Hmm. 
---
Send a message though and ban the youtubers and streamers that plaster it everywhere. Bethesda doesnt need to track or figure out who/what when people are serving them the information on a silver platter. 
---
Lore breaking or not, it would be dope
---
for the 'white' locker?
---
No prob
---
So you’re mad because someone was there first? A lower level? Trying to level up? Wahhhhhhhhhhh.  Cry some more why don’t you. 
---
This.  I have been a developer in the software industry for over 20 years and a software product should not even reach beta before the development team has built support tools for it.  Logging, analytics, diagnostics, player toolbox/support ... it should all be there for release and this game is clearly missing essential parts of it.
---
I have that problem where most traders have like 2-3 caps because people travel back and fourth taking them all. Why in the hell its capped at 200 caps? Who knows but it is really annoying. 
---
Yep
---
You can for many pistols/rifles, but I'm not familiar with laser weapons. OP - try modding the "grip" to a "stock" 
---
sure, that.
---
Except in the case of Bethesda and these "bans" is that they don't have said "blatant evidence of you doing it". Their "evidence" amounts to you had cheat engine running in the background or had a mob installed or whatever. You see F76 doesn't have a anti-cheat system in place that would gather said required evidence if cheat engine was actually used to alter F76 or not. And that's why people take issue with these "bans". Believe me people would bitch at you a hell of a lot more if you were banning people left right and center without any "blatant evidence". And that's whats happening to Bethesda with these bans right now. 
---
That's why I have avoided "the endgame players." You are all complicit. You are all guilty. You should all be purged.
---
was it just labeled locker?
---
I can help with home defence, don't think I have fireproof. I will add you later, let me know if you find someone else.
---
i think the new "player vending" they just announced will fix that problem 
---
No, I'm only funny online 
---
Top that - he's using people on the map to locate others. So when you are wanted, mics should be disabled in-game. You should have no in-game advantages at all.
---
Yea it was
---
What? The ban hammer will solve nothing.
---
Yeah. This would be the one main hurdle. 
---
Ideally you would "save" your place on the original server, while you visit the pocket dimension. You should keep your camp, workshops, etc as-is. 
---
The shared dimension would be more of a quick-stop area. Get in, do some shopping/trading, and get out. 
---
Maybe use the AFK timer: as long as you're in the shared dimension for less than 30 min, all of your original stuff is retained on the server. After that time frame, you're logged out of the server, and only exist in the shared space. 
---
...until that gets changed.
---
Neither does the electric chair 😞
---
The best armor for this game is absolutely the \[You have disconnected from the server\]
---
No problem 
---
Won't be on around that time, might add you anyway, check out the discord if you have it 
---
https://discord.gg/falloutreddit
---
roll through morgantown or watoga high schools, tons of plastic in each. 
---
Same. Mine's a Level 25 Bloodied Explosive Lever-action. With all marksman perks and demo expert... It packs a hell of a punch when I'm low HP. If I'm any less than about 80% health, I can accidentally kill myself with it in one shot too, which makes the stakes REAL high if you're fighting ghouls. Kinda fun, in a way.
---
I'd hoped so, but I don't have many mods for it so I don't know if you can. 
---
The only way to make a decision about Starfield and TES is any good is to read reviews and/ or play it yourself. 
---
I do not, and have not, defended this game. I complained about it many times and have repeatedly said that it has very serious problems. 
---
But those problems have already been noted many times over and so I think we have come to a point where I don't really see a point in saying what has already been said countless times about this game. 
---
They said they were working on it
---
Doesn't mean you're heat sinks are clean. 5 months is a long time for dust and grim {Dunno habits or environment}.
---
Fallout 76 could be taking up much more in the line of resources than the other games as well, which would create more heat. As the chip is working harder to pump them frames to the gpu. Making it hotter.
---
My 8700k and 2080ti run warmer in this game than others. But that's due to the games poorly optimized engine. These parts also run hot under load, never above 65c though.
---
Just throw on an Ink Spots radio on spotify, or youtube etc if you don't have premium like me. Most music in FO has come from them afaik. It's not something in-game, but it's what I would do if I still played 76.
---
I just thought they were always destructible.
---
be funny but impossible, theres no way for bethesda to tell or find who did and did not dupe. the way fo76 is set up theres actually no way to even implement a way to find dupers unless they rewrite their cataloging code.
---
Melee is super OP in this game. Explosive weapons are the only thing that keep ranged weapons on par with melee. So in the end everything is pretty much balanced.
---
Yeah not great lol be much better if they were OVER a certain percentage
---
Why did you spend so much time stockpiling water? Were you using a pump? You can gather it quickly from a river or a stream.
---
Your settlements actually got attacked in Fo4? Only happened a handful of times to me and the real disappointment was the lack of AI and # of attacks.
---
To answer OP i've had 4-6 laser turrets automatically win a defend event at workshops vs a scorch beast a few times.
---
With that said there is no workshop that won't be attacked by low level enemies like dogs and mole rats which turrets mostly completely ignore. Someone posted 4 behemoths @ the nuclear dump but the biggest thing to attack me is super mutants.
---
So "the point" is in supplementing you and your teams abilities. A team of 4 Contractors could empower a shop in 5 minutes and have considerable defenses.
---
2 tricks: It's often easier to retake a shop than defend it. Smaller horde, 1 wave, concentrated spawn.
---
Also everyone uses the fast travel mat? If critters are stuck then fast travel back to your shop. Should reset their spawn and only takes 30 seconds.
---
Just like in Fo4 there is a point based DEF system - has anyone completely pimped out their shop yet? Total build capacity with nothing but laser turrets? Maybe 12 of them? Would probably be able to auto-win anything but 4 behemoths!
---
I’ve had this happen as well. Someone killing me repeatedly even though I’m in pacifist mode. I thought this was a bug to be honest. 
---
Or maybe the vault?
---
Dang I was wanting to do some nukes later today
---
Yeah my downside to the dragon is that it takes about 3 weeks to relaod, lol, and it breaks after about 10 shots
---
Yeah, it's only good for crafting, which one can buff with drugs like mentats and [food items](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Category:Fallout_76_consumables_boosting_Intelligence).
---
Besides that, it doesn't really have a decent passive increases. 
---
If only having higher int meant:
---
- More effective/longer lasting chems (like 2% per perk point or something that doesn't out-shine perk cards)
---
- Less chance of disease/faster curing without aid
---
Turn on controller support in game settings 
---
Is there a technical way they could date stamp items and only make items collected after a certain date available for vending, then crush the dupe expolit before that date?
---
The saving grace for games that have had these duping issues early on is that some of the best items have yet to be released. They need to use that to mitigate the profit for dupers.
---
Make sure all known duping methods are fixed, then release legendary power armor, and true 5 star legendary weapons. Along with level 60 and 70 equipment of all kinds. As for combating vending abuse another way, put a cap on the amount of items that can be sold by each player. Or dont. Pretty soon all those stims and nuka colas will be worthless and we can focus our Caps on plans and tier 2 weapons/armors
---
Some legendary effects really are garbage. Some are amazing, some are fine, some are rubbish.
---
I've found two mutant's armour pieces.
---
\&gt;4chan, where every post and reply has a picture
---
🤔
---
I didn't know anything about an event. You mean I didn't have to spend Atoms on this picture frame?
---
Not sure about the rest but pacifist mode doesn't stop you from taking damage it just stops you from accidentally instigating by causing damage to other players. 
---
Seems the biggest issue is that the slap damage isn't a set amount of damage like 5hp but rather a percentage of total damage. With explosive and other weapons potentially doing insane amounts of damage, even that reduced percentage can be a one shot kill.
---
Bethesda needs to change the mechanic behind slap damage to be a set and small amount but even that won't help if you retaliate or otherwise engage allowing full damage.
---
Nope, if nothing has changed they are indestructible and the absolute best way to block off doorways or anything you want to block off.
---
and IIRC part of the glitch itself involves destablizing the servers anyway, so if they fix the duping, people won't dupe any more, which will help server stability.
---
If Dick Shale is not alive and well in one of the vaults...fail
---
I forgot this wasnt the market oops, thanks anyways
---
I wish pistols weren't trash :(
---
Yep taming animals is a thing. I have a pet megasloth who wanders around my camp and guards it while I’m away. Eats a ton of budget though 
---
There is no reason CE is running ever. Thats why every decent AC kills it before you launch the game. Its a memory editor designed for cheating.
---
Nah. Fix duping and then add a new letter to all created items after that patch. Only allow vendors to sell new items. 
---
Allow players to report dupers and empty their inventories manually when caught. Finally the effect old dupes will diminish over time as players gain new items over time. 
---
Problem curtailed as I sit here pooping. There are plenty of options in the great big world. 
---
One possible issue with your idea. What if someone traded for a duped item without knowing it was duped? Your plan seems to think it's perfectly ok to punish someone who has actually done nothing wrong just to make poor ol' Tommy Jones happy. Seems a bit shortsighted.
---
all locations listed have water and can accommodate 4+ industrial purifiers
---
* directly west of the sparse glade in cranberry bog you will find 2 large lakes build on the highest one (the lower one has a slight chance of aggroing scorchedbeasts (firecracker berries)
---
* in the water west of the red rocket south of harpers (ticks close for stimpaks, glowing fungus for radaway)
---
* directly south of watoga station (log extractor, cranberries, legendary and mirelurk queen spawn close) (note there is an unmarked fissure site south east of the log extractor site, but it is a passive spawn)
---
* near silo alpha (lots of good spots go exploring around here)
---
* east of grafton near the closest farm (acid and fertilizer or oil node)
---
I'm interested too. Level 34ish, usually on after 8pm ET 
---
Tmsales5
---
They decay overtime
---
clever tactic good fight 10/10
---
No such thing as a laser rifle plan I don't think so you should definitely be able to do this
---
I haven’t seen. There definitely were in F4.
---
That's why carnivore mutation is way better then vegetarian: place your camp near some kind of wolf/animals spawn and you're set. Never gonna worry to repair broken crops or boil that damn water ever again.
---
Thank goodness I launched my story nuke the day before!
---
By popping a lot of them. 
---
Get over it.  Different game, different handling of item scarcity since everything respawns quickly and you get infinite weapons.  People would be farming low-level scorched all day.
---
Making this whole thread wasn't very Christian of you then.  
---
&gt; Matthew 5:38-40
---
her 'final' message may or may not be at a bed n breakfast north of site charlie..  
---
it really could be, i feel bad :(  
---
But it cost everything. 
---
easiest item to craft in the game, it's just wood and leather.
---
I've met one hardcore raider RPer and it was amazing. Like, the whole experience was worth the loss of my house, which he gleefully and meticulously destroyed. Dude cackled maniacally the whole time and sang random songs like a complete psycho. He chased me halfway across the map with a machete. He couldn't really hurt me but I ran around yelling in the spirit of things. Then I told him I was interested in the raider faction and he dropped a screw and left. Fucking legend. 
---
Recently?
---
They can cause we've done it just wish we could all fight the same shit without my 5th buddy getting blasted by friendly fire on accident lol
---
This is normal and expected. Why aren't your friends reviving you? 
---
It's the same respawning as it is just fast traveling. It just gets you close, you have to do the rest. 
---
It's partly why I moved my house once. You'd fast travel to it and you'd be on the wrong side of a cliff. 
---
Yes when launching a nuke
---
It isn’t. He’s definitely a raider. The note was found under the bridge near the dam area. There are more notes like this, but I only found 3 altogether. The other two talks about how he knew a settler, but was killed because the house the settler built was out in the open and the other  talks about how they almost got the hydroelectric dam working.
---
Never mind, IGN beat me to it... [https://uk.ign.com/maps/fallout-76/appalachia](https://uk.ign.com/maps/fallout-76/appalachia)
---
I get that. Just don’t know why it was brought up. 
---
Thanks. I haven’t been through the high schools in about 30 levels. 
---
Yeah, though it took forever to find one that was tameable, there’s certain restrictions like it has to be a random spawn 
---
I remember a time when I could actually trade items regularly, but it all changed when the dupe nation attacked......
---
Mothman Cult and Death Givers who basically enable griefers by taking their bounty.
---
We've had the "I AM the final boss" guy and the labyrinth guy, and the other dude with the TSE team daring us to take his bounty.
---
If you want to team up with my on PS4 we can scour the wasteland of any would be workshop takers!
---
Without using TSE weapons, it's a hell lot of effort to kill someone with slap damage. Doing it repeatedly would yield extremely diminished returns (if there were any in the first place).  
---
I love how some jackass downvoted you for providing the rule, lmao
---
Right next to the dam near Watoga. Free travel to two vendors, wood, and a stream. if you put a tent workshop near the water enemies can't see you. Recommended to do Mayor for a Day before using this location
---
Can someone explain FO76 dupers exactly? Like what and how they’re exploiting?
---
I prefer scoped headshots over vats.  Vats you have to get too close and the accuracy is still not that great.  Just get a suppressed 308 rifle that has 90+ accuracy and 160+ range. You can stand off most groups of mobs.  
---
Escape artist in agility is a must when you need to run away.  So is max sneak.
---
Lone wanderer and agility boy don’t stack right so take 1 or the other.  
---
I don’t find long shot worth it, missed shots with a suppressed rifle don’t break cover. 
---
With high perception, you can see farther than you can possibly hit so if you can’t hit something in 3 scoped shots move closer.
---
I use this as a sneak rifle build and find it effective.  I don’t quest and mostly clear the cities  for xp so I am not in tight spaces often.
---
So this person is claiming that they’ve said something that they haven’t actually said?
---
I'm hoping it's more along the lines of far cry. Where you have individual goals, and community goals 
---
Just curious could it be with the game not rember if that the player is the rank of [redacted] in [redacted]?
---
Yeah I know it 'could' be duped and if it was I wouldnt mind losing it, only thing making me think it wasnt is that theres was only 1 at the vendor and its not exactly that great of a weapon, longest reload time and troubleshooters
---
Nah they drop trash weapons
---
The market is the biggest prob from duping.
---
And now it hunts you again, lol
---
Yes, exactly. I had some  concerns about them releasing an online multiplayer because your typical Bethesda bugs become a much more serious problem in an online multiplayer game. 
---
Imagine whittling down the Sorchbeast queen down to one percent health with ten minutes to spare on the clock when suddenly you and your entire team get kicked off the server.
---
This has actually happened and it is terrible. 
---
Pacifist mode might help
---
Yeah, but with TSE weapons and the demolitions perk, you're still putting out tons of damage. Plus that debuff doesn't reduce your attacks against camps so one's RP as a wrecking ball remains unfazed.
---
You might want to believe that, and if you only read reddit you might *actually* believe that, but it would only take a casual glance at current market trends to show that's not only *not* true but it's moving the opposite direction: For whatever godawful reason we are moving more and more towards a microtransaction-type market and not just in video games, it's infecting every facet of life at an ever-increasing pace... this is the way the world is now and it looks to only be speeding up, with powerful (and populous) countries like China leading the way... there simply aren't enough people like you or I that want to go through the trouble of taking an active stand against this kind of market and it *is* taking over
---
Should. Bethesda SHOULD have a way to view player inventory. It's entirely possible that it's just a few linked tables in a server somewhere that only a handful of people can access, and that they would need to build out a full UI for support to be able to use to modify things safely. And I suspect that fixing things is a higher priority than implementing that.
---
Source: I QA something like that for a living.
---
I keep trying to save my caps but then I see something I like and they go back to 0 again, lol
---
I mean, me personally I think Vault-Tec is always evil. Somewhat similar with the enclave. 
---
instant death mostly, it wouldnt bother me so much if the loading times wasnt so bad even on a m.2 SSD 
---
Nerf explosive damage and balance PvP, problem solved.
---
Hey everyone, just sharing the news that we're actively investigating the nuke silo access issue. We are currently planning to release a hotfix tomorrow. Keep an eye out on the @BethesdaSupport twitter for updates as always.
---
Thanks all! :)
---
I had always assumed that since every day is SOMEONE's first day playing the game, the date would always have to be reclamation day or the very first thing wouldn't make sense to the player.
---
Well I have finally seen the Vendorbot  with wares for  sale. Well, not really much for sell, but I found him nonetheless. I traveled from Sutton Station to Charleston Station following the trail tracks. As soon as I crossed the bridge to the north of Charleston Station there he was. Has nothing to speak of other than some aid items and a civil war dress and yellow slicker hat. So I bought the hat and dress because why not and then proceeded over the bridge south of the station to trigger the random events. I killed all the obs and ran back to when the bot was but alas he was gone. I guess the random spawns made him disappear.
---
At least I know he exists. Now for another 400 server hops to meet him again.
---
I haven’t found one but there is somewhere you can go to find an alien blaster so it’s either there or they are counting the Flatwoods monster. 
---
It would be cool if legendaries had unique skins instead...
---
I have been complaining about the same thing!
---
No my friend helps me as a middleman. 
---
You can get the plans (not just only the mod) for the T-51 jetpack. Phoenix sells them in Watoga for ~1300 caps, but I’ve only seen it once. 
---
The guns are an issue sure. But arent mutation serums super cheap to make once you have the recipe? 
---
I had everything in my camp duped multiple times. It took me awhile to realize what had happened.
---
Lots of the dupers just make a metric shit ton of boards to get the exploit working, from my knowledge. I'm not sure the exact process, but it seems like they all involve making boards by the hundreds.
---
I have plenty of badwidth, no one is on my internet, I have 150 mbps up and down, and it's exceeded bandwidth? lmao.
---
There are two things to interact with. They are very close together. One takes just the bone meal. The other takes the 3 chemicals, one at a time. 
---
Lol. No. Muahahahahah
---
You're right that trailer is nice!  You too btw lol
---
How did you take away empath on both of you and not loose other mutations?
---
You should do it Dark Souls style where you have an anti-team. 4v2 for example.
---
It's not like they're all within your level range or something, what're you going to do get carried? Events are a lot more fun with big teams - crab swarm barely worth doing solo.
---
There are no code Gus walking around.
---
I was around a survey tower where there are a lot of potted crops. So I climbed to the top to see and there was a couple laying in bed. They had spent the last 4 years in that tower planting and being happy until the woman passed away. You can find a note in the room from the man, saying how the crops she left are growing well and he will join her soon. Heavy, indeed. 
---
No it affects everyone.
---
Sadly you are correct, but I still stand by that poor products receive poor reception.
---
Rip guess I gotta wait a bit before I can farm stims
---
Incisor.
---
It's an absolute must for a melee build.
---
It does the same thing if you try to fast travel to your friend when they're in a building or cave instead of spawning you in the cave or building it does the same thing, doesnt really make sense because if they're outside you spawn on top of them no problem 
---
[Feel me](https://imgur.com/a/B4so27v)
---
I wonder if that has anything to do with moth man cult under the museum 
---
👀 (if you were a puppet not knowing the truth about anything but know something is up would you think the puppet master is evil) 👀
---
Just a question to spike morals ;)
---
Hey Axl. Just so you're aware, we're actively investigating the nuke silo access issue. We are currently planning to release a hotfix tomorrow.
---
We'll share more info on the subreddit when we can :)
---
That is true. (*nods*)
---
Player wipe is idiotic.
---
The irradiated bone meal goes to the right of the computer screen. The other ingredients go in a circular spot to the bottom left of the computer screen. I had a similar problem initially. 
---
1 purified water + 1 nuclear waste = 1 boiled water!
---
:D
---
Same, but I also have my camp just about how I want it, so I run pretty lean on what junk I have stored, basically only really keep stuff to fabricate more Handmade Rifles so I can farm for mods for the one I have.

I had this issue and couldn't complete it. I went and did a few other quests and came back and was able to do it. No idea why it didn't work the first time but it was frustrating so I feel for you.
---
Yeah, cuz it's got electrolytes.

Thanks to the Appalachia radio, I now like to spontaneously end arguments with my girlfriend by screaming “I DIDNT KNOOOOOOWWWW” with an extremely obnoxious and cracking voice.
---
“YOURE ALWAYS PLAYING VIDEO GAMES”
---
“YOURE ALWAYS PLAYING WITH MAKEUP”
---
“YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING FOR ME”
---
“YOU NEVER ASK ME TO DO STUFF FOR YOU”
---
“WELL YOU NEV-“
---
“I DIDNT KNOOOOOOWWWWW THE GUN WAS LOADED”
---
*visual anger and confusion*
---
I REALLY wish there were powerful "faster reloads" perks... It might make the single action revolver useful, lol.

I never disagreed with that. My point is that people claiming that people are abandoning the game in huge numbers aren't really helping anything because obviously nobody really knows. As with most communities, the most vocal are gonna be the pissed off people. I will say that I still highly suspect workshops to be be contributing to the DC. Like I said, I almost never DC. I can tell you that when I do, it's almost always at some point after I claim a workshop. Like literally every time I'll DC within 30 to 45 minutes. If I don't claim a workshop I'll stay connected until I leave.

They are, but it's still somewhat limited by the fact that they require flux and the recipes are extremely rare. They wouldn't be as cheap as they are now if people weren't duping hundreds of marsupial and speed demon ones. Or duping tens of thousands of stable flux

Im just advancing the game to see where it goes. They don't give me an option to join anyone. 
---
I’ll have to give it a try
---
I use VATS for creatures that burrow, but I also don't sprint everywhere if I'm in PA.
---
Hey Barefoot! Apologies for posting this response in a few threads, but just making sure people are aware that we are investigating the nuke silo access issue and, currently, we're planning to release a hotfix tomorrow.
---
We will share more info when we can. Thanks everyone :)
---
Excited about the new quests, but also not because it will be too easy because 2SE and Melee weapons that will one shot everything. 
---
Ah, got it. I remember a month ago people complaining about “they didn’t engineer security in the game and it will be a problem” posts. Shockingly, it’s a problem.

RIP melee builds who want a high inv cap
---
Before release they said there would be no paid DLC. Only the Atom Shop. All other updates will supposedly be free.

I saw my first one while roaming the hills between to the south of Bravo Site. I briefly saw one near the ammunition workshop although it quickly disappeared which left me wondering if they were really there in the first place. 
---
Probably so, and if Bethesda takes it from that’s fine, I just want my caps back. And the vendor to be negated the caps 
---
Just now did that. Slow charge and I have a 2 shot explody lever action that does way better damage faster. 😪 oh well. At least it LOOKS cool
---
Yeah, I don’t really feel like going back to ESO. Crafting and other stuff became a job. 
---
You can just not use those guns, thats mostly up to you, but im sure a nerf for tse will be coming 
---
He arms, yes. All ores except ultra cite 
---
I believe an item reset is needed. It's the only way to fix the game. Including weapons and armor
---
My ghoul slayers mr handy blade is amazing. 5 stacks of adrenaline and it's doing 120 damage per tick. Literally 1 shots ghouls. All I do is strafe and hold left click and they die before even landing a hit. It's the best. 
---
If it means less time farming... 
---
Nah, Instigating Lever with Vats crit and VATs hit chance for my VATs build. 
---
Also, I never said people who have bought items from dupers should be banned. I said the items should be deleted and the Dupers themselves banned.
