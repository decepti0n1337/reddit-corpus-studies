I know. We are the problem. I can live with that.
---
---
---
Dang, thanks for offering though üëä
---
You‚Äôre a true patriot.
---
They said it‚Äôs something for s future update 
---
Pretty sure I got the Winter Mask, showed up late to the event, but all robots survived. @ work so I can't provide a screen shot just yet.
---
On PS4 I've found that when a game does this sort of thing it's time to do a "rebuild database" operation. It's particularly needed when a game can be started before it's fully installed.
---

---
The only annoyance to doing this is the return of the discovery messages, you know, "did you know that you can press the Shar button..." Etc.
---
Whenever a game gets wonky on me I do the rebuild and virtually all the problems stop.
---
Most recently I had to do it because I started Anthem while it was still installing.
---
Whenever you are ready message my GT IMMORTALP74 
---
Or maybe he just doesn‚Äôt really like you.
---
So he's not broken I just have really bad luck?
---
I'll sell mine I don't wear it anymore 
---
But it doesn't spoil so there's that.
---
What system?
---
That's just their dialogue to announce that they're donning their mask. Nothing to do with players - besides the fact that I have seen multiple runs where everyone already had a mask.
---
The CM missunderstood the words of the DEV. If you watch the stream, you will realize that nothing like that has been said.
---
It was a 1* for me every time. 
---
Yup
---
I got one
---
I have a gtx 1080 and my game runs at a steady 83 fps, I've never had a game be this consistent. 1440p monitor @165hz. I have to check my exact settings as I don't remember and can't check it right now
---
Thanks.
---
The fact is at the moment they're so rare that 30-40 attempts at the event have only given me common items.
---
I'm getting the same thing on ps4, I'll have enemies that haven't loaded in yet damaging me when I'm trying to server hop at whitesprings 
---
Except that all numbers in a computer are not real numbers and there is a measurable chance of getting 1 - in fact it should only be around 1 in a hundred thousand or so with an even distribution.
---
I'm guessing we'll probably have to wait till "Wastelanders" hits in the Fall. It's the one labeled as having "Main Quest" stuff. But who knows, maybe we'll get to finish it in "Nuclear Winter" this Summer.
---
I scored an extra one last night. If you're still on in 3hrs I'll be home from work then. Xbox Gt QuakeSumo 
---
I've done the event twice and both times got the same mask! Soldier mask
---
Why don‚Äôt you just grab a power station, sit there, and watch it pump out fusion cores until your inventory is full? I never even leave my power armor, have a jetpack I use often, and have over 40 cores in stash and inventory. Don‚Äôt know what y‚Äôall are complaining about.
---
Every event I've taken part in (8 or 9 so far), all bots survived. We all got the same non-rare masks every time.
---
It's possible that it may have come from when people accessed the dev room and all the unreleased content. There were people who got the fasnacht content months before the event started and they even posted what the masks looked like in their inventories. To think that someone might have a screenshot leftover of them wearing one isn't too far fetched
---
Did you ever find out what was causing for the projectiles to vanish? I returned to the game after 3 months break and now my plasma gatling is doing exactly the same.. Drives me crazy!
---
Hmmmm interesting...
---
Good for you bud. Question is, do you want to sell?
---
To be fair though, The excavator skin should be cheaper anyways because it's only for one set, whereas the others are for all the T and X series
---
Does your teammate own the red stove already?
---
Nope, just me. Have built it at 3 different friends‚Äô camps without them having it. 
---
My only concern would be the suiciders blowing me up.  Otherwise, yeah, sounds like lots of fun!
---
Yea sure 2000 is good my psn is girlscoutcookiej
---
Ultracite can 9nly be used on guns with a prime reciever. You'll need those plans or mods to modify a gun first. 
---
Awesome, most likely will be on 8n 3 hrs
---
But... you‚Äôre sleeping. You can‚Äôt check your pipboy with your eyes closed silly. 
---
It does not appear to have a tag receiving "number of surviving robots", no. The number of robots controls the loot by changing the loot table you pick from, besides, which would mean a *second* control is unnecessary - you already have the table for "5 survived, give a mask and a plan", the table for "3 or 4, give a plan and roll a dice with anything better than a 1 for a mask", and the table "1 or 2, give a plan and toss a coin for a mask." If it were to be affected by number of surviving robots it should be in here, not the list of masks available (which is where it is).
---
Happy cake day!
---
You must have a prime receiver installed onto your weapon of choice, it is a weapon mod for a comparable weapon. all prime weapons require their own plan learned from the Scorchbeast Queen
---
thanks my dude
---
They can be both.  It doesn't remove the challenge either.  It removes unnecessarily tedious aspects.  Ie: swapping perks just to open an ammo can.
---
Challenge shouldn't be created by an unintuitive menu system.
---
Whoever came up with Fasnacht at Bethesda deserves a raise, it's brought so many players together for a fun daily.  They should keep releasing more like this with each season.
---
Sat there for ~9 hours to get both of those and the jetpack. I feel your pain.
---
Beret
---
Lol I guess so 
---
Challenge works better if your character drinks with you.
---
Any power armor piece with paint from the atomic shop can't be dropped or sold.  It's Bethesda's way of forcing anyone who wants the paint to buy it. 
---
  
---
If you want to drop it, sell, it leave it in a container for someone else, etc, you have to remove the paint job.    
---
I had this exact problem myself, and this is how I finally solved it. 
---
Because my experience on Xbox with ingame chat has been less then stellar. So I use party chat. Plus with my headset if I am in party chat I can control voice and game sounds separately. Can‚Äôt do that with game chat, and it is hard getting all the sliders just right so I can hear everything and not drown out voice chat. But mainly cause bethesda did not do a very good job at implementing and executing in game chat.  
---
I said i don't mind the 25% cores?  Check your reading comprehension. I'm "complaining" about Bethesda seemingly nerfing them but not including that in patch notes
---
This is why she cheats on you.
---
I usually see ghouls or mole men there. Will keep an eye out for ants.
---
I feel sorry for the guy
---
Cool. You on tomorrow? I will add you in the morning as I'm on uk time
---
Damn, I'm not looking into the code myself but it was the only way I could resolve Ladydevann's comment with your figures in my head.
---
Srsly man. Game runs okay on a much worse system. Heck, even console can run it. If your 2080 ti can't handle fo76, there's definitely something wrong with your configuration or settings.
---
Yea I will that's fine
---
I got one. Thanks though!
---
Those numbers aren't related to the mask rarity. The mask rarity is in the mask list and tied to each individual mask. The 50 means that if three or more robots die, you have a 50% chance of not getting any mask, the 15 means that if 1 or 2 die, you have a 15% chance of not getting any mask, versus if all live you have a 0% chance (ie; will always get a mask).
---
I think it‚Äôs because they added an event that encourages people to aggressively server-hop while simultaneously having the hardest thing on their server be loading a new person into the world.  
---
Keep grinding Charleston station though, save some caps. It was the first time in about a month I got the vendor not to spawn. üëç Otherwise see you in 3
---
Nice one. I had a guy last night agree to meet and sell and he sold it for 200 more caps, seems like people's word means nothing these days. Drop me a reddit when you are to go on..I will meet you in artisans corner shop in hotelüëç
---
It will be extremely helpful for you to invest in perks that reduce the amount of junk used to build power armor, although that doesn't happen until 41.  You're going to need an awful lot of springs and screws.  Find lots of clipboards, desk fans, typewriters, toy trucks, etc.  I had good luck with the Charleston capital building.
---
You provide the violet flux, I can put an excavator calibrated shocks on for you. I bought the plan, so I would probably just give you the leg off my PA (lvl 45) and build a new one for myself after getting the flux. If you want to throw in the t-60 mods I wouldn‚Äôt object, but all I ask is for the violet flux (5 I believe, but will have to check.)
---
X01 JetPack plan......... lol 
---
Happy jumping my friend!
---
Same crash here on Xbox One.... idkw to do.
---
Did the event yesterday. All 5 robots survived without taking any damage. 
---
Got 
---
Giant + streamers. 
---
Something similar happened when I went to fast travel there and just got stuck on the loading screen. I eventually had to quit to the medu and log in again. FWIW it's probably best if the event si already in progress or there's a ton of people there it's probably best to FT someone like Gregs Mining or Sutton and just book it into town.
---
I got it somehow but ffs I really just need a large purifier. My camp isnt near a body of water. 
---
For a healthy real player economy, game currency has to slowly entree the game. So you first suggestion works against that.
---
The vendors refresh every 20 hours. You can make 1200-1400 a day. 
---
Perk decks would be a QOL while passive perks is just about getting more active perks. And passive perks works against grouping and sharing perks 
---
Lots of what you‚Äôve listed is along this line. They really aren‚Äôt both. It‚Äôs just greed.
---
43 here. I don't get to sneak in as often as I'd like, but it's a fun game.

I'm trying my hand at running a bar.
---
How dare people do things you dislike. Ban them from the game. 
---
Have you given your stuff away yet?
---
There's one backend bug that players will almost never notice that, if they haven't fixed it, might be causing this. The function they use to roll % chance should roll 1-100 to be accurate and fair, but it actually rolls 0-100, so if something is set at 0 (ie; supposed to be 0% chance it can happen), it still has just under a 1% chance it can happen. And in the loot list, all robots survived is set to be 0% chance of not getting a mask.
---
Other places this came up are things like the dagger of Mehrunes Dagon in skyrim, which was supposed to have a 1% chance to kill instantly, but actually had just under 2% (because it could kill on a 1 *or* a 0).
---
Don't know if this should particularly high priority to fix since it's only nudging % chances slightly but if /u/LoneVaultWanderer wants to pass it on anyway ...
---
I did it nothing special happened 
---
I get leveling is your thing or whatever. But this game offers a lot more than that, I think a reason they did this is they want players like you to realize that. Also, it caused that area to be frequently filled with players much more than any area on the map. Through other comments that Bethesda has made, its clear that they want to avoid that happening. 
---
That's doable. I am fairly certain I have 6 violet flux in my stash. The mods you most definitely can have. Won't be home for about 2.5 hrs though. Gt QuakeSumo 
---
We can't tell if screenshot you mentioned is photoshopped or not. One thing for sure is that there's no known way to obtain said helmet and the ones circulating on the market are from devroom. I can't say you are gonna get banned for carrying one of those but it's not legit 100%
---
I agree. I have had to repair the legs once in 300 hours. It is very durable with 200% from Fix it Good... solid.
---
lmk your settings when you get a chance
---
Sounds like you already own the prime receiver for your hunting rifle. If you mod your gun you‚Äôll see it as an option, and just fyi it gives +30% damage to scorched enemies but -30% to all other enemies so it might not be the best receiver for you just depending on what your play style is. 
---
I used regular liquors, wines, and spirits. Worked without a hiccup. (Besides being constantly drunk, there goes my addictol.)
---
k downvoted
---
You can scrape for most of the plans. For a long time I just stole one off of a super mutant and modded it until I was able to craft a pistol. The more exotic mods are event rewards for BOS and some enclave ones. Watoga is where I got a few mods from vendors. 
---
T-51 version here.
---
https://i.imgur.com/cglLTte.png
---
Also the prison events can drop the plan
---
You need left or right leg? And just message me when you get on. GT Teni Volka
---
I've been getting duplicates when wearing a mask during the event. Not sure if anyone else has experienced this.
---
Does it start on the hour?
---
I can craft alcohol for you easily. If you need extra basic alcohol, I can provide it for ya. I'm working through unlocking each beverage you can craft with the Brewing/distilling update. Darn nuked flora..
---
I would also like to prevent them from being sold. I was in Power Armor and had a couple of similar combat armor items, and sold some... a sad moment to realize you sold the 3\* instead of the 1\*.
---
Maybe they want us to craft them which means more nuke runs
---
The problem is, when I try to remove the paint, it won't on the "copy". I can change the paint on the original, but then I can't equip the copy. So I'm still stuck.
---
Ok cool 
---
I‚Äôve ran into a responder  vendor bot and couldn‚Äôt trace with because I didn‚Äôt have on my responder outfit. A sad time. 
---
Where can I find some laser guns? The prison has never triggered an event for me either. I must've server hopped 20+ times and the event never triggered.

I hear you. I am just speculating that maybe rolls are better if everyone is wearing a mask.
---
Bwahahahahahahaha guess Bethesda thought of everything. . . . Oh wait.
---
Do you not know what a spoiler is?  This is literally just the names of masks and plans... and it's a thread specifically on datamining.
---
If you're far enough along and crazy enough to try and decipher the nuclear launch code on your own, you'd collect all 8 for one silo and use the keyword found at the Enclave Bunker (along with a nuclear key card) to do it. In reality, people just use nukacrypt or reddit or something similar on the interwebs to find the code and launch. 
---
All wild game animals seem to drop them. I have an animal spawn in my camp and I was getting intestines from possums, squirrels, rabbits, and chickens earlier today. I shot some radstags too but forgot to get the meat before I left camp so I didn't see if they had it but I'd assume so.
---
I feel like this only happens in power armor 
---
Well if you stay drunk, you don't need the addictol. \*hic\*
---
Heard it's the weapon mods that's causing this issue
---
Completely off topic but does anyone know how to complete overseer mission?  I nuked from alpha and Charlie at queen but do I have to do it from bravo too or am I missing something?  I have her nuke laugh tape I thought I was done but it's still active
---
That's going to translate into alot of unwanted attacks on poorly geared characters or those without pvp equipment.
---
Rng really. Super mutants always at least 2-3 in their ranks for rifles. Lewisburg is nice for them. Fort defiance sometimes has a few tucked away. And I farm Watoga daily and get 1-2 legendary ones every so often. 
---
But check vendors for one someone is always selling one. If nothing else see if one can craft you one to atart with. 
---
Totally legit
---
&gt; I want to believe that's a possibility... but at the same time, I think about the shortcomings of the quest, and ask myself "Could they have really put that much thought into this?"
---
How the hell you did it 40 times? I mean, even server jumping how do you know if that new server has quest starting soon?? Would like to know your little secret
---
I use pa during that event.
---
 You all honestly think that affects what you get ? 
---
Ran it 2 times gotten the jolly green giant both times. 
---
You just have to look at nexus mods for fan made QoL improvement. Many of the most popular ones on there have been around since December, some even earlier. 
---
If fans could do it, surely Bethesda could too 
---
I'll check those places. I tried watoga but people were always there and the robots were spawning well above my level because of the higher level players. Made it impossible for me to explore there.
---
that and all the other daily challenges dont even happen for me anymore 
---
Upvote,upvote,upvote ! 
---
I'm sure they'll be fixing this soon. 
---
Thanks, i have to try fiddle with them tomorrow. Silly if i have to use worse mods to make it work.. Bethesda... Grrrr...
---
Yes, exactly. I saw my workbenches floating in the air for about 2 minutes before anything else appeared. After everything else appears... finally the C.A.M.P. appears and opens. After all of that, the server tanked. I think the parade and a nuke event just kills the performance.
---
Have you done mayor for a day? And what platform?
---
Yeah let's correct that to mod for the smart arses lol
---
Might be?
---
Unfortunately , no. It's not anything new  :/
---
Ps4 and I have that quest line yes. I ran past all the robots and go to the Mayors office and now I am heading north somewhere.
---
No problem man! Happy Fasnacht! üòÅ
---
Have one if you can't find any, just message me, not my style, caps or trade let me know.
---
It's been there since 2102 (and launch). 
---
Not much of a secret bud, when you server hop and automatically start in Helvetia the quest either triggers straight away or it doesn't, if it doesn't then server hop until it does, I don't fuck around and wait for it to trigger lol. 
---
It's realistic. It's loaded with unecessary ingredients, it's not very healthy, and it inexplicably never goes bad.
---
Oh really? I would have thought I'd have noticed and explored it before now. 
---
That's the American way! This is extra funny to me as I have some really fancy English friends who refuse to drink from bottles and think American pickup trucks are agricultural vehicals! This is more entertaining than that stupid robot parade...
---
Vampiers combat rifle, two shot .50cal machine gun,somerset .44, some others too
---
Once you do it the robots will become passive and you can kill them freely. 
---
I got egg head mutation from an unknown cause just today was doing the parade event, rad toads or dirty water (I always drink dirty water for radicool and nerd rage and ghoulish) there is no reason to get a mutation while genes starched 2 active except bug. Now my mutation build is ruined.
---
Dude, he said he just hit level 20. Really shouldn't be doing mayor for a day yet. It would totally low-level the All Rise. 
---
The single most important perk for shotguns is not a shotgun perk. It's Four Leaf Clover. Even rank 1 allows you to land crits very very often. 
---
If you can post a link to your build I'd be glad to help tweak it. I'm extraordinarily experienced with shotguns. And can really try eek out some min/max. Nukes and dragons is the best site to make a perk loadout. Or even a screenshot of your perks. 
---
Try another server. Someone may have grabbed it.
---
That is good to know. I'll try to finish it up quickly.
---
So....uh...where is the mountain honey found?  üòç
---
I have 3 green giants, 3 owls, 2 toothy mans, 3 witches, 2 berets and all the plans. So I guess I've ran it a bit more than 12 times. I don't think wearing the mask equals getting good rewards, but I'm also not above asking a question and considering a possibility. 
---
starched genes are good
---
Do you use starched genes 2?
---
&gt;(which has been stated)
---
This was a misunderstanding. Someone who watched the whole vod through while listening out for it found what was actually said:
---
&gt;I just watched the full stream and the Devs never said anything about drop changing depending on the number of surviving bots. They do say that it is of our best interest to protect all of the robots to don't lose the chance to win a mask.
---

So don't waste effort trying to cut it close, go nuts blasting the super mutants away.
---
Not with harpers ferry but fort defiance. It only worked after I cleared cache and did a hard power cycle (on Xbox).

---
It's beyond easy and super boring! People jumpinh servers to find the sevent are causing servers to crash etc. 
---
Sometimes you can walk near a new location and the game won't register it, it really sucks when that happens 
---
Theres always one on the back of the wheelchair with s skeleton in it, downstairs at the whitesprings golf club.
---
There's no image link for Plans: Confetti Pile but I can confirm it drops as I received it during the event.
---
West Tek is terrible, so NIRA (the radar directly north of it. Also don't go to Generals Steak house. (Hey man, don't give Beth any ideas of they are gonna take away those spots too)
---
You can combat the grouping and sharing perks by making passives more limited with stricter rules.  
---
Also the economy is a moot point considering the only real benefit to caps is camp plans which isnt greed at all.
---
I kind of thought that the Paladin paint wasn't legitimately in the game yet. Did I miss something?
---
PvP isn't automatically griefing lol
---
Dude give it up. Your ideas are bad and greedy.
---
Pvp lives matter
---
I think its great. Always play in the band at the beginning of the parade. And there is always 2 others that I have never met join in. Got some great photos! Need more events that cause everyone to get together.
---
I will try it tomorrow. Tought was difficult to trigger it server hopping and I've been doing it every hour staying on the same map all day and going afk on camp kek.
---
Flair? I think. Flair. It‚Äôs on the right hand side if you‚Äôre on desktop. Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible on mobile.
---
Lol I'd argue that they matter less since there's a lot more death. 
---
When they said ‚Äúexceedingly rare‚Äù they were not even close to fucking around. I‚Äôm not entirely sure that ‚Äúrare‚Äù and ‚Äúunobtainable‚Äù are interchangeable though.
---
Are you saying that if you get a mask you have a 100% chance of a secondary reward? I only did 2 runs but the first time I only got a mask and nothing else  
---
I only level caracters past level 50 to try on new builds and then i do things with them around the map. I really wouldnt mind it if there were more things around the map to do. My very first character took me like 3 months to get to lvl 130 and i had fun with it all the way. But as far as a sure way to farm exp Bethesda pretty much removed all viable options. Its not like its super easy to level up that fast. A lot of prep work goes into it with my team
---
Make sure you have all of her tapes and all the tapes from alpha Charlie and bravo. Then nuke someplace that is not a fissure site. You should find a tape at that site that says she is disappointed.
---
If you know a high level, an explosive gun in the whitesprings nuke zone is a good weapon. Just tag enemies and let high levels finish them off
---
&amp;#x200B;

They are PVP tools and also for tools. 
---
Their good for non chameleon replacements. We all have access to them grief or no grief. 
---
we've all had relatively high hopes, many of us as first time supporters of a Bethesda product, that's me.
---
so far I have seen almost no communication indicating that they have heard or are aware of the most important elements which are either flat out broken, frustratingly unfinished, or awkwardly implemented despite the right core design pillars. Communication is one of those latter items. Just extremely awkward and insufficient.
---
I would recommend the text chat mod /community though. I have yet to try it because I'm spending time playing other games while I wait for them to have community involved in the development with official modding and content making support.
---
I had that happen with an X-01 mod, but it later was back for go after some time. 
---
ive come across mostly 25% charged cores since this patch, only one ive not seen as that low was only 39% charged.. luck-ally i hoard fusion cores
---
I'd recommend that you kill stuff and explore stuff. At your level, you can do grindy things like go to Summersville and kill all the super mutants there or run the Big Bend tunnel and kill all the Scorched, then server hop and do it again. But honestly, you level up pretty quickly just by finding new locations and killing everything there.  
---
What I did on my first playthrough was mostly follow my quest markers, but any time an undiscovered marker showed up on my compass, I went there. You get the XP for discovering the location (plus a new fast travel location), get the XO for killing the mobs and completing and Misc. quests that pop up, and loot all the stuff.  It helps you learn the game map, gives you the joy of exploration, and levels you up at a decent pace. And yet, you don't feel rushed.
---
I'm guessing scarce supplies in survival. Have you ever killed a guy for a can of dog food?
---
Don't try kill them, that was a misunderstanding. Someone who watched the whole vod through while listening out for it found what was actually said:
---
So don't waste effort trying to cut it close, go nuts blasting the super mutants away. By trying to kill the robots you actually are making it worse for everyone.
---
&gt;It removes unnecessarily tedious aspects.
---
Like work? You ever work? You socialist idiots don't work, who am i kidding. The second we give you more, the prices will increase. Thus accomplishing nothing. Now go fucking work for the things you want. 
---
Yes 
---
If your on Xbox I‚Äôll take you through a nuke 
---
Well that's completely unwarranted.  Thanks for the useful commentary!
---
Test completed, resut: pointless. Video here.
---
https://youtu.be/YewD0PlxwN4
---
Thanks
---
No ffs don't stay on the same map... Depending on how far along the quest is when you join you can do multiple repeats in an hour, I've joined the quest from server hopping and it literally just finished, collected the mask and server hopped straight into another quest. 
---
I dont see how the response was a surprise to op at all to be honest 
---
Someone dropped it. 
---
well after 65+ play through with almost 99% of them all 5 star I haven't even see any of the rare masks.
---
Thanks 
---
Lol yeah I know but just wondering if they actually provide a stealth buff or it‚Äôs just anti vats
---
I've got about 6-8 cores 100% and 8 at 90+%
---
I have a picture of the goblin mask idk how to show it on mobile though.
---
Well then.
---
I get that. But I don‚Äôt think they want any one area to be that much better for levelling like whitespring was. I get that it makes what you want to do harder, but hopefully you can understand why bethesda wouldn‚Äôt want that.  Considering most players are not making that many characters like you.
---
We‚Äôve got the legendary characters coming too, sounds like that will be a way to more easily try new builds. 
---
There‚Äôs no point talking because you aren‚Äôt interested in what others say.
---
You just want more money, more perks, less actually playing the game as it‚Äôs designed because you‚Äôre not really I to playing a survival game. 
---
Vodka must be vodka from the wasteland, not brewed

Add inspect period. They bugged it where you can‚Äôt tell what you are buying at merchants anymore. They should dedicate a good portion of the next patch to polish up the prior patches. I‚Äôd also love for strange in numbers to actually work right. Rather than have it partially work while close and then permanently debuff you if you get to far away. Love the game but needs polishing from the last 3-4 patches. 
---
I have a pic of the goblin mask on a player. Idk how to show it on mobile though.
---
Why would you use Ultracite in pvp when its strictly inferior in both ballistic and energy resistance to the t51b.
---
Yep thats why I was wondering if you all thought it may effect the out come. I could always run it in my heavy combat or just add the mask in place of helmet on pa.  
---
Wait... people joining servers is making servers crash? That doesn't make any sense   
---

---
I'll try that, but wouldn't Fresh Vodka be fresh brewed? 
---
Because the chance of rare masks is bugged to be 0.000001%, but it's the same chance with any number dying, killing some won't help. It just means that you only get to roll that tiny chance if you actually get any chance at a mask at all, which is only 50-50 if 1 or 2 robots survive.

Rub a little brandy on his gums.  Or a little Brandy, if she‚Äôs available.  
---
Nope, the opposite. I've done these quests quite a few times. Definitely the problem with why you weren't able to move forward
---
so u are saying it's pointless right now
---
Oh, thanks. If that's the case I will drop it tomorrow. Do you know if it can despawn? Would be nice to hide it!
---
3rd timer here also, and I highly recommend making Helvetia a nuke zone beforehand. What a blast, lol. Shit was cash. Great event and player base interaction. Wish it was longer, as everyone is absolutely obliterating the enemies. I rate 7/6.
---
To get your own, look in the right-hand sidebar for "Show my¬†flair¬†in this subreddit.
---
I have seen the red guy mask a few times. Maybe that one isn't as rare? Or is the most likely out of the rares?
---
Your my hero!!!  I luv you digital high five! lololololol üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Nice, thanks!!
---
I'd love won, if anyone has one I've got caps and resorces
---
I have an INT of 5, not sure if many people run lower than that. So crafted durability might not be the factor. Explosive gun users eating their own armor with splash damage maybe? I know when I use my explosive handmade it wrecks not only itself but also my armor (at an irritating rate, enough that I almost never use it).
---
Definitely explore all of the Forest and the Toxic Valley. Do the little quests and events that pop there. Especially horde events because they always end with a legendary. Find everything. 
---
Take some workshops - you get plans, stims, xp, water, and resources, rarely griefers. You're too low a level to really be bothered with.
---
Team up to go east if you want. But, my advice is not to rush. 
---
I went and spent 900 cap for ballistic fiber walked out, no more than a few minutes got killed in whitesprings by a gate by a mob and then disconnected, so needless to say I couldn't find my frickin BAG 
---
More likely they'll change the map slightly or something like that. If they released major dlc affecting only PvP servers, majority of people playing would be pissed.
---
imgur
---
Well then maybe don‚Äôt buy digital. Even so, the controls and control change options are still in the settings. No excuse for not knowing which buttons do what.
---
My bet is that they will change the map slightly or part of the map. They could make an erruption of ash and so it looks like snow or something
---
About 20 alcohol recipes
---
They limited the number to 1 in the last patch to allow turrets and lights to take less budget, your friend probably built before patch 6
---
Do you mean the old man summer mask that is in the Atom shop?
---
I've done it 3 times and got a different mask and plan each time 
---
I usually wear the ritual mask and science scribes outfit. I actually like wearing PA and just having a mask on anyways. Adds more flavor haha
---
It‚Äôs effective against radiation, radium rifles are gonna be popular since they will reduce opponents max health. And Rad away can‚Äôt be spammed like stims at the press of a button.  
---
I gotta get back up on that stage too!!
---

Used a stealth boy while wearing my weightless armor with chameleon mutation (overkill probably), snuck up on a ghoul outside the parlor, hit it, completed quest requirement. Bourbon and Agility. 
---
This.  And there‚Äôs plenty of high-levels around that enjoy doing this.  
---
Similar issue, first login i got the event was on but didn't attend. Went to the event later and saw the bot with the line not ready yet.
---
After that i did server hoping for like 2 hours at 2 different times and nothing, the bot master of ceremony was gone and nothing activated.
---
I don't know what the general consensus is about wearing the masks. I wear a fascnacht event mask as I personally think it helps.
---
Mine works great still woo still got my concrete base thanks Bethesda üòãüòé
---
Go in with marsupial and a radiation suit. Also get a lot of materials to repair your explosive weapon or use guns with 5 and luck of the draw 3
---
I carry a legendary medic 10mm just for large events.  Can kill if I really work at it, but perfect to tag legendaries with.  Switch to 2nd weapon if I need to kill.
---
Submit a ticket?
---
Awesome! Thank you! Would you happen to know what needs to be done for the quest "Test your luck after drinking Fresh Ballistic Bock"? My hubby is stumped on that one. 
---
Are those the camo underarmor?
---
Yep im on pc that would help my name is PeachieBear 
---
I will give a go next time I join the event cant hurt its all in good fun anyways. üëçüèΩ
---
I've left two with alphafoxwolf
---
Just give him a message when you want them 
---
What I want to know is, is Fastnacht a real celebration? And if it is, does F76 accurately portray it (in its corrupt Fallout way)?  
---
Oh you already know the answer.
---
All of the tapes you'll need are listed here: [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer%27s\_Mission](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer%27s_Mission)
---
Yeah, I usually avoid people because of social anxiety but I didn't want to miss out on the Event before it disappeared in a few days so I bit the bullet. I still didn't talk to anyone but I hung out there waiting for it to start and participated throughout the whole Event. There was quite a few super high leveled players so everything died quick but I still got to help in some small way haha Took a ton of pictures of the parade too. It was fun!
---
Camps are still buggy, I have two metal stairs I can't remove, in different camps .. pretty much ruined my camps but what can I do .. I only built them for the challenges and don't know how to fix them.
---
Got my owl on the first try as well. It was the only one that I saw that I really wanted. Got the recipe for sausage with it. Played through twice more but no mask or plans. The server was glitchy as hell both time as idiots were popping mini nukes all over the place. Got 3, 1 star pieces of level 35 junk from the giant sloth at the end. Meh, whatever, I got my owl! 
---
Yes everyone jumping server to server, event to event is causing the servers to crash! The disconnects started happening at the same time as this stupid event! Shit all the people who were un-suspended laat week at re-suspended that should lighten the load right... what a shit show!
---
That's just Fallout 76 etiquette. If you are playing with other players, let them tag enemies. 
---
If you don't do this - you're a jerk. 
---
he said "merman" [https://imgur.com/a/gbxzEaT](https://imgur.com/a/gbxzEaT)  he disconnected shortly after I took this screenshot
---
Awesome work, thank you! Now I'm absolutely sure that I won't really miss anything that I might've wanted to get.
---
Strangely enough despite all the hype around the new event and the loot people get there, I can't imagine a reason why I'd even bother to participate in it.
---
All these masks are wacky to say the least. Some camp items are ok, but really not worth the hassle, others are just plain meh.
---
You understand the title of my thread is where can i farm now. 
---
Im not conplaining about it or being negative about the game. I just wanted to know where are people farming now

If u play on ps4 i can craft one for you free. Lol

I play on PC. You guys have inspired me to reinstall when I get back from my trip :)
---
Would love to hear any tips and tricks you have learned!

Need the mask

I was a huge fan of the Sims 2. Insimenator, MTS2, etc. Loved modding the crap out of that game. ah the good days. I gave up on the sims when EA decided to dumb it down.

Thats when my fallout passion started.

---
According to a data miner the code is messed up so there is a 0% chance of the rare masks dropping 
---
You can select a special attribute you want when levelling up and use the z and c keys or console equivalent to select a card from a different attribute.
---
My friend runs a kindergarten for new players and often complains about such situations. Recently we talked on the group whether you can report a player for such behavior. It's a difficult thing. Thank you for raising the subject!
---
When you you pick your special point pick one in another category you want. Then when your given your choice of cards you are given the option on the bottom of the screen to scroll to the other perk cards in the other category's

Updated count of confirmed masks.
---
That's good to hear, I did encounter quite a few bugs and just general "huh, that doesn't seem right" moments... But it was a lot of fun. Def gonna give it another shot. I mean, I already spent the money when it came out, what have I got to lose right?
---
I just got a lvl 25 medic' s crossbow and it heals your team on a critical shot in VATS.  It does 95 or so damage without the repair boost and my rifle man perks are maxed. But no. Damn. Mods. I've scrapped a bunch of crossbows still nothing 
---
Ah damn, thanks tho 
---
Yes, fasnacht is a real celebration celebrated in Helvetia, WV, in Pennsylvania Dutch (Amish) communities, and in Switzerland and Germany. Well, they got it mostly right, except for the fact that they don‚Äôt have robots running around in masks irl
---
The two new small content drops have distracted people too, specially with the farming involved in this weeks parade
---
Been feeling that way too, personally I think everyone is growing tired of the repetition. 
---
Updated post, thank you for the proof.
---
That worked üôèüëçü§ô
---
Nuka cola dark, lead champagne, tick blood tequila, old possum, high voltage hefe, ted water or red leaf beer. That‚Äôs what I got so far
---
That's might kind but I figured it out üòÖ
---
I had it happen long time ago, only way I fixed it was by removing my camp 
---
Written the first hit single for my Monongahela jug band?
---
Wanting to spawn in a user specified location in your own camp is socialist and lazy I guess?
---
Fasnacht happened.
---
It happens pretty much every hour, which is also an average turnaround time for getting into a silo, launching a nuke, and killing the SBQ.  I've thought about launching one just for the heck of it, but players are still server hopping quite a bit, which makes the overall levels of the players on the map inconsistent.  No point if the map has a lot of sub-50s.
---
Awesome. Glad to help
---
Ok it takes 2 buttons... and nobody is going to be pvping with a radium rifle... and even if they are that's a crazy reason to use it for the like 4 people you will encounter with that strategy in your lifetime.
---
Okay well I‚Äôve got my Ultracite decked out, is xo1 better?
---
Steady streams of higher-level people completely obliterate that thing before most players get a chance to tag, as most of you reading already know. 
---
I‚Äôve completed 26 parades since yesterday til now, currently seeking #27 as I type and it seems like I‚Äôm one of very few only tagging it instead of unleashing hell. 95% of the time low use or just anyone who isn‚Äôt the fastest dips in the west misses out. 
---
I have many duplicate owl masks if wanted still 
---
If you need a nuke to be launched for 250-500 caps just message Solstice
---
I'm pretty sure that is the "moon" mask.
---
I mentioned this to u/LadyDevAnn and she passed it along to the team (the fast travelling into darkness).
---
Starched Genes is essential if you care about keeping a specific set of mutations. 
---
It makes sense, I stopped playing for two weeks and started with nukashine again. But I¬¥ve only seen one nuke so far this week (and played like 3-6 hours every day) and that nuke was already dropped on map when I joined so no players there.
---
I did the event twice and never even saw the Sloth
---
Ckeck around and inside pumpkin house.  I found my costume for first time there!  
---
Make sure, before you go out, to sleep in a bed and get well rested. You get +5%XP for 1.5 or 2 hours (can't remember exactly). My teammates and I have even stopped mid-quest at sugar grove to sleep in the beds there after it had run out. Lol
---
Also, pick cranberries on Aaronholt farm in the NW. Cook up some cranberry cobbler for an extra +5%XP for about a half hour. Eat one every half hour.
---
Team up with some higher level folks who won't mind taking you into some high level areas. One night I went up almost 3 levels when some guys took me through the bog and the mire. They took over a couple of workshops as well. 
---
You on PC?
---
I'm saying!
---
According to Bethesda, the game can crash due to network connectivity issues.  I've *never* experienced this before, but I also haven't played a lot of online games.  I *have* noticed that when I team up with people with crap connections, the game becomes unstable.
---
When you say "ok", do you mean it doesn't crash/hang/disconnect?  Or are you saying it's playable, but less than max fps?
---
For ref, my FPS seems consistently 60-61 (according to the Nvidia in game overlay, which I've now disabled, in order to eliminate it as a confounding facor).  Sometimes SBQ fights are solid (her loot list loads instantly after the last patch), but sometimes it's a bit laggy.  Strangely, it never hangs long during SBQ fights.  I get more hangs around Charleston station.  And just random things like looking at the pip-boy or picking a lock can cause a crash.
---
The beta ran great, except when I tried to use a BT headset.  The hangs started a couple patches ago.  This last one introduced CTDs.  My GFX card has changed...that's about it.  I've stress tested it, and it seems solid, so...I dunno.
---
And I‚Äôm saying you should say goodbye to the idea of one place being better than another. Aside from events and nuke zones. 
---
They also patched an exploit that allowed you to skip to the very end of the nuke silo stage. 
---
What are the stats on shielded raider?
---
I mean yeah thats normal, but there are always new players and nukes is late game. Level 50 here and still haven¬¥t joined any nuke because I was waiting to level up. Just reached 50 yesterday but no nukes :(!!
---
They aren't too bad early on for escaping or eluding Scorchbeasts, but beyond that, there's not really a point.  If it matters, you can have Chameleon armor or the mutation, which don't grant you the same mobility, but accomplish the same basic idea of not getting seen by enemies.
---
[removed]
---
It had nothing to do with content.  I have to put hundreds of rounds into cargobots now, and they run away far more often than they used to.  If you engage a cargobot, it legitimately takes as long or longer than it took to do a silo run.
---
Also important, Bethesda fixed the wall glitch and ceiling glitch, so silo runs once again require actually going through the whole silo to launch a nuke.  Used to be the case that a group could get on, take out a bot in a minute, all get keycards, pick different silos and beat them in about 10-15 mins, and launch together.  Now it's more like an hour and change to get one launched so they aren't anywhere near as casual as they were before the early March update.
---
:p thankfully I read this 4 months later so I've rarely if ever seen a player there. Gonna try it for the first time tonight
---
I have server hopped numerous times, several of which I‚Äôve had to unlock the door and the plan is never there 
---
If you look at the link there is a picture with all the stats of the various different ones on there. 
---
What constitutes a rare mask?  Wouldn‚Äôt it be more efficient to have users select which masks they‚Äôve gotten?
---
I may be reading this wrong, but I want to pick new perk cards, ones I don‚Äôt possess. I know I can swap the ones I own out but I want incisor and the two handed melee perks, but I do not own them. Can I pick new cards somehow, or do I need to restart?
---
I've seen this before.  I don't think it's an exploit, but it is a quirk that goes away if you relog.
---
They showed a player getting their limbs blown off in the reveal trailer. But it's not in game. 
---
What‚Äôs the drop rate for the beret? I have all the normal masks and duplicates of most of them but still no beret. 
---
That actually makes a lot of sense but.... last week playing everyday only saw ONE during nuka-shine release, and I was used to see A LOT since release untill a month ago that I stopped playing :(
---
Report them for playing the game?
---
Err, i suppose i shouldve included that. Added now.
---
Yea grey camo
---
speechless. bravo.
---
Yeah, when I'm playing on my low level alt I don't even care if I didn't get the chance to tag the legendary sloth in the end of the event. It's just 1 star legendary. And idk if I wanna kill the mutant suicider as a low lvl in melee range. I don't even have fireproof perk yet. I always let the high lvl to kill them, I'm just helping with the pre-parade stuffs to collect things for the bot.
---
how high have you stacked yours?[ im at 4.](https://i.imgur.com/cBgXMlh.jpg) 5 if you count one that I took from the middle of the stack, and it let me for some reason.
---
Oh, I've already got them, thanks anyways
---
Thanks.  The darkness problem is what I've encountered the most. But tonight there was no darkness, but a disconnect. 
---
Don't know maybe the disconnect was just bad luck, as opposed to a glitch. Bottom line,  I can't remember the last time I fast traveled there without encountering problems. 
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Haven't had it yet. It doesn't say for him? Normally after you drink it, it says what to do.
---
yeah suuuuure
---
Yes, just like the person above said, you can pick a new strength card. When you level up, first pick your special point category (for example, intelligence). Then the next step is to pick a card, at which point you go to the strength category and pick the strength perk card you desire. You do not need to pick a perk card in the same special category that you leveled up.
---
No if your under lvl 50 it prompts you to pick where your point goes. Click one on we will say agility. Then it shows you agility perk cards. From here you can use the filter buttons to switch over to the strength cards.
---
&gt;Alright, let's take this slow. This is unconfirmed (and personally i think it's just a bug) but IF, IF, IF Bethesda was purposely leaving the best masks out of the parade until the last few days of the event to generate more interest in their in-game cash shop, do you think that's a fair way of having an event, despite leading us to believe that all masks are currently available?
---
For fucking ONCE someone comes with a good and explicit question.
---
I think yes, it's fair, particularly if all the masks are available on weekend. That's when they should be, as that's when most people will be playing most.
---
It's a bit odd way to have a week long limited event, that starts on Tuesday/Wednesday. But then, we are playing online game made by Bethesda. Imagine that, Interplay and Bethesda fought in court over the rights to make this.
---
LOL omg I didnt know they could stack! That is hillarious.  Im so including that in my next build xD 
---
i have a bloody explosive gauss that has +15% faster reload that if you get a BE with 90% weight reduction i'll trade you mine and caps
---
what are your luck and intelligence at?
---
What did you need to do to complete the ballistic Bock quest
---
The game doesn't make this very clear, but choosing a SPECIAL point and choosing a skill card are two completely different decisions.  For example, you can take a point of Perception, but choose a Strength card.
---
On the screen where you select the card, there's a sort option on the bottom that lets you choose from any available card.
---
I see I just found the answer in another post, thanks so much.
---
It's always 5 randomly picked from the list. Maybe, that would be interesting but also really annoying
---
Maybe sitting down and checking their phones is alien to BGS employees. Maybe they all only use their phones while standing.
---
Just had to craft one. Today I have a red River IPA or something
---
I completed the event during a nuke, and I didn't get any of the rare masks although I only completed it once. The second time (the blast zone cleared at this point but the suiciders were still level 68) there weren't enough high levels and all the robots died.
---
yeah I have no idea which one it is BUT it's a new one at least lol.  Told ya I been running this shit non stop and this is the first time I've seen this one 
---
I seriously relate to not wanting to talk to people in game. Anytime I run into a random person I tend to act as though I don‚Äôt have a mic, but I forced myself to talk to people In Helvetia and actually met some pretty cool people! Just wanted you to know that I know how you feel :)
---
goblin mask [https://imgur.com/VeJYncj](https://imgur.com/VeJYncj)
---
I know. I haven't learned it and in the workshop preview for it's kinda hard to tell what it is so I left it out.
---
How much? Or what do you have to trade. I've already got all masks (except like jester, sun etc) and plans.
---
Appreciated! Shouldn‚Äôt be too much longer now 
---
Thanks for the comment but I don't like Gauss rifles. I gave away my TSE for free to the original seller. It wasn't my kind of gun.
---
make a bunch in your stored, then spam the place button on top of a pre existing one. getting the green is finicky, so you gotta have patience with it.
---
All masks you mean the common five people get?
---
What platform?
---
I‚Äôm on PC - gt is Drino. I‚Äôm either solo or with my hubby and BIL in a lil team. I‚Äôd be happy to help you out, lots of resources to share. Got plans up the wazoo, and happy to build you a water purifier and help with your camp. I‚Äôm not a whiny crybaby either. LOL 
---
Same here.  Seems like there are a lot of them around though.  I also have only gotten on toothy man, but a bunch of the others.  That is probably just RNG though.
---
if you see one let me know i love the gun but i don't love the weight
---
Without requiring photo evidence this poll is pointless. There is no hard evidence at this point to suggest the "rare" masks are dripping right now.
---
Im doing it mostly because I'm a whore for timed/seasonal events like this in games and have to collect everything.
---
Im on ps4 sorry
---
Thank you nice info
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
Well.. x01 has better radiation resistance and energy resistance than ultracite. T51b has better ballistic and energy resistance than both of them, less radiation resistance though.
---
All rare responses without proof (it asks you for it if you click yes) are ignored.
---
You need to get a critical hit. It's easiest for me to do in VATS because I'm a melee character. I just use VATS to hit a few enemies until my critical meter is filled, drink the Ballistic Bock, then trigger a VATS critical on one more enemy. Good luck!
---
Yeah
---
Interesting that one in the image is the Atom Shop one that's yet to release (Moonshine Mama). The "merman one is just the giant one from what I know.
---
I dont even know what marsupial is, also i dont have any explosive weapon, im level 16
---
Oh okay, nice. Good looks then, my bad
---
Gets destroyed by the new mod
---
yeah I'm wondering if they are being hacked in somehow.  Which leads me to wonder if they are actually available at all lol
---
I do not know what to think about it. On one side, he's just playing. But on the other hand, clinging to a new player prevents him from gaining experience.
---
Thanks, very useful.
---
Its a cheated mask sadly. Its an atom shop mask coming out sometime this week. :/ did some research after seeing the photo.
---
Does the game crash? I get disconnected from time to time when server's unstable but game's never crashed as far as I remember 
---
All good :)

Intelligence 21 (max + egghead). Luck 6.

I saw a pic of this somewhere earlier and someone was saying it would be for sale after the old man summer sale is over, but I guess not.
---
The link doesn't work for me.
---
Looks like you got it!
---
I have one on PS4
---
Add me: BradyTheBrat123
---
I think it only works if you have the mobile app. I could be wrong. It tells me to get the app before I can view it. Even though I already have it
---
Grab a frame from the world to use as a holder for spare pieces. You can mix and match of course. X01 helmet on same frame as Ultracite left arm and Excavator right leg etc. 
---
That was my reason for selling. The weight, ammo weight, ammo value. And charge speed. I can do more damage by using Blackpowder. I'll try to remember you and send it your way if I see one.
---
Thx
---
What platform are you on?
---
My first run all 5 died and I got the toothy mask, Xbox player. 
---
He had to get a critical hit, I guess lol thanks again for your help! 
---
What platform are you on? I‚Äôd like to talk about buying the shotgun and black powder pistol. I‚Äôm on PS4. 
---
Are you on PS4 by chance?
---
Well it comes out the 21st so maybe it's out for some time zones?
---
That‚Äôs not the goblin mask....
---
This is exactly the problem with the notion of underpowering yourself intentionally just for the sake of other people. Sometimes shit needs to be killed quick in order to successfully complete an objective.
---
Enemies aren't pinatas that every kid needs to have a hit at before it gets destroyed.
---
Sorry that's not the goblin Mask. That's the Moonshine Mama Mask from the atom shop see [here.](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6wzJHNfuM1wa2mGyDq62yD/fallout-76-new-items-and-sales-in-the-atomic-shop) Thanks for the help though :)
---
So basically stealthboy is chameleon that can move 
---
Not worth not killing them fast. They can level up on their own time. 
---
Yeah thanks for the help! It was a real struggle until I realized most of my problem was that I use the reddit is fun app. Thank you so much for the help I'm friggin jazzed!!
---
Oops. I forget platform. I'm Xbox or I'd love to sell it to you. I'm sorry. 
---
Oh crap. So if I want to try 3 different x-01 torso mods I will need additional 3 frames. 
---
Thank you for the replies. 
---
Btw, what are your thoughts on using emergency protocol  and reactive plate mods?
---
Just make a thousand iron daggers.
---
Which means the only thing they're good for now as a PVE player is server hopping and plan farming. It is now an under utilized mechanic because a sad pile of ores you have to babysit.
---
I usually prefer PVE experiences to PVP experiences, but I still rock a full set of PVP gear at all times. In my mind that's not an enjoyable dynamic to have in game.
---
PS4
---
Can confirm I was wearing a Goblin mask and then proceeded to get a witch mask which I did not have!  That would be brutal if wearing a mask decreased drops lol
---
I‚Äôm making this for pvp btw

Did it twice so far, very fun to see all the players have a party! I will do it again tomorrow as I had to go to work. But we need more of these events! It makes the game so much more addictive üòä
---
Excavator? If it is it's a known glitch. IF you leave game while in Excavator Power Armor when you log back in your carry weight will be 100 pounds more but as soon as you exit it you'll lose it.   
---
Just make sure your in it when logging out if you need the extra. 
---
It broke for me too the quest was broke 3 months so I just had to wait try to do other quests or something
---
It's not cheated. It's out. You can buy it in the Atom Shop right now.
---
[Actual Merman Mask.](https://imgur.com/a/Y7BnE)
---
It is supposed to be 345, but if you relog while wearing the armor it is bugged to add an extra 100 pounds. 
---
Yeah, I have the app and it does the same for me. I tried the link in app and it leads me to (what I assume is) your profile but I don't see any fallout images in it let alone the mask.
---
Did you ever get it resolved?
---
If I log out wearing my armor, I have 100lbs extra carry weight when I login.

There's a new cellar underneath with a level 3 lock. I think there's 2 or 3 in there, though. Plus, several vendors (including Phoenix and the Watogabot) seem to have it fairly regularly.
---
Basically, yes.
---
That‚Äôs strange because it‚Äôs the only post I have.
---
Ah, I was gonna give you one.
---
After waiting for a patch. Have you logged out and back in? I tried that for me and it broke it but I dont know if it was just me. I sent Bethesda a report they cant do anything. Ots against they rules.
---
What's your Gamertag? 
---
Your mouth is saying no but your firing pin is saying yessss
---
I was pronouncing it like the font name ‚ÄúHelvetica‚Äù because I‚Äôm an idiot 
---
When you craft the vodka you have to let it ferment. 
---
Hmm the link you're trying to link is https://imgur.com/user/TacoNinja1 correct?
---
I keep them in the vain hope that I might be able to show them off in my CAMP someday, but that's it.  Their effects are too odd and finding specific magazines is too unpredictable.
---
IMO, they could have tied magazines to unique Perk Cards.   That would have been cool.
---
Once you ferment the vodka it'll work.
---
What happened to your account?
---
If only they could fix the stairs issue it would make it much more easy to build nicer camps, and save time in the process üò•
---
Yes, when I click on it, it works
---
Made it for the fight, good job everyone!
---
Thanks, may have to drop in between parade runs 
---
In event, I've gotten giant, beret and soldier. Player sold owl to me in a trade.
---
It‚Äôs all good - thanks anyway! Good luck selling your stuff, and finding explosives. x
---
I also tagged in to fallout76 on imgur. Look In the new posts.
---
I hope that I bucket head shows up...
---
Dang bro this is an old post.
---
Verify your game files.
---
I wonder if it can be possible to get 100% of all inventory?
---
If so, how long should we stay in helvetia to ensure we participate in all of them?
---
 just use em. Bobbleheads in my experience are more useful. They're not so rare that you won't find again especially if you use the perks that help you find them. 
---
Stabilized gives an accuracy (stat) bonus. Equip the weapon, note the accuracy stat, then Equip the perk. If you get the accuracy, you get the armor pen. 
---
so be it. The truth is the truth and that is that russians, just like in Dota 2 are ruining the game.
---
I‚Äôm assuming agility needs to be high because when I‚Äôve popped them before enemies still spot me lol
---
I collected magazines. Never used one, but they seem to sell very well. It may be profitable to search buyers.
---
I can imagine bethesda not wanting to deal with all those 'I'm innocent didn't do nothing wrong. prove that my 500k ultracite ammo and 1mil nuka cola ain't legit' shiet
---
Camp loads slow and when I server hop in a different location I have to wait for all the event notices to go away before I can move. It's even displaying events I don't have activated. Sometimes it will freeze for a minute.
---
I hope you find your dream weapons on the next 3* ghouls.
---
I feel like this could all be solved wait some sort of exp sharing, like it doesn't need to be 100% shared but if you are active and in an event you should get some exp, and it should be the same for being grouped up too
---
I don't need no 10 hour loop. It's permanently fixated in my brain
---
Because there is a Geneva convention 
---
&gt;Seems like this is appropriate for your buddy: [https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19)  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;That aside, others have given much the same specific answers that I would. More broadly tho', in this game, at least the best advice is: don't worry about it. The game is as tense as YOU make it. There's no rush.  
---
&gt;Check out [/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/) if you get a chance. A whole bunch of people that simply aren't taking things seriously.  
---
&gt;The consequences of death are almost nothing. You can ONLY lose your junk and with the possible exception of Ballistic Fiber you'll be surprised how easy it is to gather way TOO much stuff. Food and drink are almost laughably plentiful as well. Feel like tear-assing across the map to find some new fast travel locations? Dump your junk and head on out - there's literally no downside!  
---
&gt;Caps/money can be tedious to collect, but isn't difficult. You've noted you have the skeleton plans - those are a GREAT money maker. A few cloth and plastic and you've got a super-light item you can sell to any vendor for 40-60 caps. The only thing better than the costumes is the Civil War top hat which sells for less, but only need couple cloth to make. You'll quickly amass more stuff that you can store and nearly all it can be sold.  
---
&gt;For what it's worth, I farmed for the witch costume for over a week and, nope, never got it (did get the skeleton tho'!) It's still out there, but there are SO MANY random encounters that the likelihood of any specific one is terribly low.  
---
&gt;Good luck and welcome!
---
I played this game solo for the first 35 lvls but after I met some people in-game that wanted another player for their team - everything changed. The game is well-suited for team play and I really enjoy the game more when I'm adventuring with others. 
---
I totally think we should have a player hub. Bethesda get on it!
---
I think I will sell all Bobbles and keep just 1 of each. And I I don't like magazines at all, would like to sell them. Their effects are so random that you are not going to see much benefit from it than a certain moment against some enemy, that's all. At the beginning I used to enjoy using two perks slot to find them. Now feels like a waste of two perks, kinda sad. 
---
Yeah it very well might be.  I've now seen another person in that mask since posting it.  BUT Can't say really for certain one way or the other cuz the guy just left.  HOWEVER that behavior of just leaving does seem suspicious lol
---
Lol. So much better than buying the jet pack mod.  Time to print your own caps now.  Haha. Never knew x-01 mod plans existed. 
---
You mean you have sold them to other players?
---
The invisibility effect, regardless of how you obtain it, isn't absolute.  If you get close enough, they can hear you.  Robots tend to detect you quite easily while cloaked.  It's just how they are.
---
But even if they spot you, it doesn't mean they'll be especially accurate about hitting you.
---
its showing in my shop now
---
No joke there. 
---
Hey waffle, i just checked my shop and its showing up in my shop now.  Maybe it was legitimatly bought, is it supposed to be available now? 
---
Or when you have bulked loads and forget to take them out before hitting the mass scrap button...d‚Äôoh!
---
You left one point of it. And I‚Äôm no professional and I‚Äôm working on making my first good build atm but it looks like some perks just don‚Äôt fit in. Idk I currently have a half rifle half melee build that I‚Äôm trying to get the levels to change to another build. I understand it is useful to be able to melee good and shoot decent. But you will never have just one thing great with a cross build
---
Xb1
---
Platform? If on PC I can help. 
---
I had nothing to move or get rid of. My weight was 203 and stash was at 532. The data they used on me was from Jan and I looted a bag as well as others in Whitesprings. The bag appear to be from a player vender that got nuked. I wondered over wondering y so many at edge of nuke zone. A whole lot of junk was y. Talking 40 to 80k of each possible junk item. My mistake was looting it too. Anyhow the items I ditched and month later got email stating the items I picked up and suspension.
---
Oh ok. Cool I'm not able to look right now I just figured it wouldn't be till the 21st for east US time since that's where Bethesda HQ is.
---
The problem is you're using Buffalo trace. Try Knob Creek or Basil Hayden's instead. ;)
---
Well yes, but actually no. I see a lot of people selling and buying, but I never have bought or sold.
---
There are players that collect the magazines. You can sell them. 
---
Server hop is an effective method since the event resets every hour and lasts a decent amount of time
---
Cool I found it! I will edit the post. Did the person say how they got it?
---
So like when it‚Äôs caution and you‚Äôre getting fired upon 
---
Yeah I'm in EST timezone and it's showing for me, just realized lol
---
https://imgur.com/a/gbxzEaT
---
I just want an automatic removal of all the junk and trash that is lying around in the workshops by default like car wreckages in the race track workshop.
---
Are u sure about that? Prime receiver weapons do bonus damage to sbq and sb. It doesn‚Äôt state less damage to other enemies. The anti-scorch receiver fits the description you mentioned. But 20% damage buff/debuff not 30%. Prime receiver and anti- scorch receiver are two different mods.
---
He said he traded someone for it. The post where he acquired it for on r/fo76bazaar has been deleted.
---
Cool! Wish I had the atoms to get it lol
---
That is a cool looking camp! And the view!!
---
for everything but the mega sloth... it's nbd, but please don't exploding two shot shotgun the sloth... twice.

Sometimes fast traveling to camp and back to your buddy helps. Not all the time, but sometimes. 
---
Interesting...wonder if it was legit or left over from the Dev room. I've heard/read that subreddit is pretty sketchy.
---
If you're on PS4. I'll buy your mags
---
just need a person to help me thanks ill add you
---
Use one of each type all at the same and report back to tell us what happens. 
---
lol yeah, should be able to get 500 in 5 days I hope (assuming you didn't do like every weekly and every other challenge already lol)
---
With how lucrative it is compared to everywhere else, I don't blame him
---
fuck no. don't be ridiculous.
---
You can get to the dev room on Xbox?
---
I've found ONE magazine that was useful to me at the time (lock pick one level higher)when I was starting out, since then I dont even pick them up
---
The sloth is the only one he is refering to. 
---
Yes you can. Those saying you can't are blatantly wrong.  But I mean,  anything to circlejerk against Beth, right? 
---
They added the other mask to the atomic shop, maybe the other masks are live too.
---
[Here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3bw4b/fasnacht_event_rewards/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) is my post compiling them all and with pictures.
---
Ive dropped a couple today. Try bouncing servers or kickstarting the fire yourself.
---
My last one burned everyones britches, but hey, i needed violet flux. South of the gator it went.
---
Idk about you but I had to Server hop 14 times to find itüòÇ
---
You havent lived until youve shaken your fist at a cloud. 
---
Its easy to run them solo in 20-25 minutes anyways...
---
What mechanic is that being a asshole? Because it serves no purpose nuking the parade.
---
You were able to access it on any system, external programs weren't required.
---
Thank you, didn't see that post
---
Where do I find swamp plants?
---
I‚Äôm a noob but I just finished one by getting carried by some people. I got a Witch Mask and the Beret. Happy :)
---
Wow.  Master class.  This is after the fix on the foundation stack I assume. 
---
I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard this before but white spring nuke zone is really the only good way,  otherwise you can try uranium fever and farming west tech 
---
That's a pretty small number, but good for you.  I hope your issue is validated, and the people that play that way are punished.  Will it make your game better if there is action taken?
---
Thanks for this data point.  Which is rather concerning...I've read about so many folks with CTDs, I just assumed it wasn't me.  Of course, I'm not having any issue with any other app, so...wtf?
---
Not with the pvp pvp split
---
The repetition is quite annoying but it‚Äôs the only way
---
So really if you get any of these rare masks they are one worth a ton and two you should probably buy a lotto ticket because u are super lucky. 
---
Everyone I've met with a mic has had a name like "Max420Griefer" or at least should have.  
---
Not really sure what a going rate is...how does 300 sound?
---
500caps for an owl mask. I have yes
---
I've heard you could on any platform with the right glitches, but I could be wrong.
---
No problem :)
---
Yep, booze is way easier to come by lol.
---
Ammo is common as well but there is still a way to craft it. All I'm saying is that having a faster way to get junk feels like a good idea to, me at least.
---
Tree fiddy.
---
We all make regretful perk choices like that.
---
Annoyingly, I don't think you can sell magazines to vendors.
---
When in need of fusion cores, I just kill sentry bots at WS. Kill the sentry, get the fusion core and server hop. Takes abt 5 mins and get 3-4 cores per hop. U lose the robot aggro when u server hop. 
---
To be fair, the fact that people can crash the servers or other clients due to in game issues is no ones fault but Bethesda‚Äôs 
---
I can craft it on ps4. Need 3 brahmin milk,1 vodka,1 canned coffee. Produces 3 each time
---
Yeah you‚Äôre right my b for spreading false info just looked it up on the wiki. 
---
But I think you will be able when they add camp vendor machine!!
---
Pacifist mode doesn't protect you if you have a Workshop.
---
My pc ain't anything fancy but game never crashes. That's why I'm thinking something's not right with your settings. There's no way 2080 can't handle this game. I have no idea what the problem is with your machine but it's not optimized to run fallout 76 that's for sure
---
Deal
---
I wasn‚Äôt as mad about the crash, that‚Äôs basically expected at this point.  I was pissed that he decided to ruin our time for the lols
---
And still if someone suggests a PvE only server, hundreds will cry about how that's not in the spirit of the game.
---
Crafting them lets you make overcharged cores depending on your int level.
---
I have the mask
---
This spreadsheet here is the most accurate one I‚Äôve found: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L5c8ZKCCf4OaNglGc516dl9AFxYWnMUDuhQbHjrlQkQ/htmlview
---
We don‚Äôt we were just hanging in our camp trying to do inventory management. My friend was carrying over 1200lbs worth of stuff and we were helping him parse things done. This guy just floats on the air and kills us. 
---
Oh yeah, so much fun.
---
You do not die, while there are those who can take part of the damage on themselves. Once again - try to kill the queen solo. Feel all the pain and misery of a low hp build.
---
Except the highest stack of anything i had was 180k of .50 cal normal ammo. Which i crafted over the course of 3 weeks.
---
Submitted! Really wanting to know the results if a lot of people took this poll 
---
Same reason as most people, getting slammed for having to much ammo that i made. Not even UC rounds...
---
Me too
---
I got it and no regrets.
---
Server hop away 
---
How much more days for the event tho
---
If this happens go to your map and " join event"
---
my wife gets so mad when i do it. but i sneak him some at night same as i did for my daughter
---
I'm on xbox:( 
---
Its not possible to one shot someone in pacifist. Its possible when engaged in pvp if you own a workshop or on team with somone that aggros another individual. So no witch hunts when obviously you participated
---
Mad or jealous?  Sneak her some, too.
---
Xb1 just happen like five mins ago! 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure until March 26.
---
Yep.  Did you run or join me in inevitable death?  Lol
---
You on ps4?
---
I'm not resuspended... 
---
The event is on a timer. It begins an hour after it last ended. 
---
Keep server hopping until you find it, happens every hour per server.
---
I just left laughing he just missed us!
---
Keep hopping servers or wait because the event happens once an hour.
---
You and the 3 others isnan even smaller number. 
---
An hour after it last started actually
---
In theory, yes.
---
That's one way to look at it.
---
I do too 
---
An hour after it last started, actually. If it takes you 20 minutes to complete it, you can play again in 40 minutes.
---
My bad. Thanks for the correction. I don't server hop and just do events between parades. Time got away from me. 
---
So far its at 112 responses(i also added it to my post on the front page) and 0 rare masks.
---
There was also speculation that you could find new if you used strength to push the pickup next to the SSAnne
---
I got 100 pounds of magazines on me. I got them all while looking for the unobtainable one,but now i'm just waiting to use them as decoration. Without a mule they're a pain now tho. 
---
Right now they are too situational,mostly because you cannot choose which one to find, and they last not even half a avarage session.
---
The collector perk should work so that it makes the effect unlimited( obviously 1 at a time and as long as perk active). This way you could lock what you want,without losing the versatility of switching them.
---
Basically what happened with the perk exploit. You had to relog every 2 hour but the effect was unlimited.
---
Ok. Thanks everyone
---
Sometimes a Dame just wants to kick her spurs up and play some Grognak games...
---
The former was always there.  Don't know what you mean by the latter.
---
I'm not seeing it yet.  Do you need to restart the game to make it show up?
---
This event made me realize how important chat is, AND WE STILL DON'T HAVE INGAME CHAT!!!!!  
---
In thr science wing. Where the serums are. Opposite theat is a wall with light and different enimes
---
I stayed as long as I could and got an infinite loading screen when I tried to respawn
---
They did say only UC ammo would bring a ban. It‚Äôs possible they messed up. Or maybe you did something else too.
---
The lack of animations, probably.
---
Event is active here:https://youtu.be/ZsD61nMiPJk
---
Event is not active here, no one in the vicinity. https://youtu.be/9hcbDJ2vHSU
---
If you have all the common masks and all the decorations then until we hear something new, it probably is, yes.
---
Rare=/=unique.
---
It‚Äôs near the vault
---
I can help you out if need be
---
I put together a couple T-60's to have armor I'd have PA to paint. I don't use armor a lot, but I find the T-60 good enough for most situations when you get to a higher level.
---
Near the vault

---
Do we have a single occurrence of a PC user having one of those rare masks?
---
I did my first one. I never got a mask as a reward though. However several players were kind enough or upset enough to drop some extras. I got 4 masks. Likely all common but I was happy. :)
---
I think they could at least have 20 masks for us, at the moment looks like round 6 
---
This is amusing.
---
I found one unopened and went through most of it got to the terminal and my game crashed had to start over
---
One always spawns in the Level 1 Locked Cage in the Responders Bar in Flatwoods.
---
Other than that, I just do the "Can Do" run around Whitespring and Bunker and get a bunch.
---
I recall seeing some in the kitchen area in the Nuke silos in the very beginning. Silo Bravo specifically I didn‚Äôt check the other 2.
---
I really hope the adventure servers will eliminate all pvp, and the pvp'ers can have there own server.  I can honestly say that i doubt anyone who played any of the other fallout series is interested in pvp at all.  I just want to be overencumbered and hoard stuff with my friends.  
---
I haven't, but unfortunately my word is nothing. Also the community can be quite horrid since 90% of people are just on witch hunts. The community is killing the game as much as Bethesda itself is
---
It's under apparel, not featured.
---
Dataminers can see the loot tables (I've looked personally too) and there's nothing that asks "what is the player wearing" anywhere.
---
That said I wear them because it's fun. A group of my friends and I all got owl masks and started running around the server in a big group invading people's camps in pacifist.
---
But what if I'm running around wanted and they get the first shot? Am I out of luck? I'm thinking the only way to beat them when you can't get the first shot is to jump out of the way but even that's hard to time if you have a little lag. One person suggested load them up with rads but even then how can you do that if they get the jump on you. 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm running through white spring right now cause I just realized it works on trash cans. 
---
Do lots of defend workshop events. Take over a workshop with a vertibot, keep destroying it, repairing it, etc. takes lots of aluminum &amp; steel, but you get about 200-300 Xp per vertibot. Or just keep doing missions and farm reasonably-leveled enemies. And keep doing fasnacht since it pops up so frequently now :)
---
That is too bad. It's pretty neat. Maybe it will be back someday.
---
Ouch-town population you bro.
---
How did you get crops growing inside?
---
That's awesome..
---
I've been keeping like 50+ intestines on me at all times (Good with Salt) while I'm grinding out this event just in case
---
Well, that's how numbers work.  For sure.  I'm just going to count myself as lucky at that point.  It's a nice thing for me!
---
The dude abides....
---
Oh man, I'm totally going to have to try this tommorow. I've just recently started wandering into nuke zones, so it should be crazy good fun.
---
What system are you on...pc?
---
yeah I as done like 50 events ago... lol 
---
I see... I, in turn, tend to pursue things that appeal to my sense of style. I don't really like all that wacky stuff from atomic store and goofy quest rewards. That's why I make mods like this: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/259
---
And this: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/233
---
I haven't seen a single PC user with a legitimate screenshot of any of the rare masks. I don't think they're dropping personally. 
---
Concrete is one of the ingredients of razorgrain flour (which is an ingredient) so of course it doesnt spoil.
---
thanks for info!
---
Apparently death is a secure way to get rid of addictions.
---
Nope! Not seeing it.
---
There are like nine masks that can drop from the event with three of them being considered very rare. So rare that only one person has posted proof of getting one. Based on the loot tables it looks like Bethesda fucked up the coding to the point where there's about a 1% chance to get one of the rare ones. I think it was supposed to be ~15% chance for the rare ones.
---
Same on Xbox One X with an SSD (and 2 normal drives)
---
Every one I participated in today, and I did it enough to have multiples of every common mask and the beret, had 100% survival of the bots. I never got a rare, and I never saw anyone wearing one. 
---
What do you mean its the 21th of march
---
Thanks just bought it!
---
Oh ok I thought I was just pc
---
Is this one of those ‚ÄúI tripped  whilst carrying a bucket of margarine and landed on it doctor‚Äù things??
---
I've gotten the witch mask 3 times oof
---
180,000 rounds is a bit much. Even if it's normal. Highly unusual. Not saying you cheated but if I were Bethesda I'd do a double take there.
---
Yeah someone definitely would have posted it by now people love to show off their stuff (and why not)
---
It triggers itself every hour. The event usually takes about 20min to do it. Everyone usually leaves after, then shows back up when it starts again.
---
Are you PC, ps4, or xb1?
---
Thank You! I knew White Springs. I just was wondering new methods
---
I hope to get some confirmation from this post. Either they are, or just enough people without any evidence, which would assume it's not true.
---
I'm not home so I can't check, but is it a limited time offer?
---
I've done 3 queen battles. Had all no loot. I've even waited 10 mins each time.
---
Now get a chainsaw and run after the low level headless.
---
PM‚Äôd you the method for doing it in under 2 hrs.
---
PS4.
---
What‚Äôs your gt?
---
Thats the main evidence for me. Not 1 post on the Reddit of someone saying, I got this *photo*. Or trading this *photo* for other rare mask
---
What IS Yeet? 
---
Seriously? I really don't know
---
But it still affects Top of the World, which can be an issue for a few of the early questlines. Like my mother was level 22 doing quests there and was getting destroyed by level 60 supermutants cause there was a level 77 dude nearby.
---
I've yet to have it higher either
---
That wall in the science wing has always been there
---
You're not missing out, I just had to listen to some idiot blast his shitty music over his mic for the duration of the Fastnacht Parade.
---
If you still need the green hood no mask, let me know
---
Really wtf have i been smoking holy shit balls. Looks new to me 
---
Got it now
---
Seems weird you sure you don‚Äôt have a perk card that doesn‚Äôt allow you to. Because that‚Äôs a thing lol
---
I usually become addicted when I continue to consume before the effects have worn off from previous drugs/drinks of same variety. 
---
So, I got the party streamers plan, but it ended up unlocking the Hanging Ribbons plan. :/
---
I wanted my streamers. :[
---
Dam it! Lol so did you get all the T60 paint plans?
---
Have discord? It‚Äôs a lengthy explanation. But it will get you to 50 in one night if done reasonably well.
---
Which perks dont fit in? and what should i replace them with? and yea i have a point spare but i dont know where ill put it yet, i mainly done the things i felt were crucial to melee and rifle.
---
No problem.
---
Technically I could just hop all day.  But I'm afraid to, so I've been limiting my turn ins to my normal number of one or two a day.
---
You got 5 days :) 
---
Just saw like 4 people wearing it at my last parade, but it's not visible in the shop for me ü§î
---
If you are on pc I can sell you another set I know em all except healing factor and egg head ;)

It was on featured for me, maybe they just fixed it? 
---
Is it one of the active Robots for the event?  It changes each time, even though the cooler is always there.
---
When this happens to me more than once I close the app and restart, usually it clears it up. 
---
Strangely enough, sometimes when i server hop "too fast" i am surprised to see i'm back on the same server. Or am I crazy?
---
Same here. Put this piece of trash aside for a while. Loaded it last night played for about half an hour before everything froze and the game crashed. Tried again tonight and I'm getting the server not responding controls frozen message popping up on the screen non-stop. 
---
I swear to God if I ever find out where Tod Howard lives I am going to steal $60 worth of his long ornaments just make up for my waste of money on this game.
---
Still working on it and need some more pics on the

I agree with everyone.  My only real criticism is that as a lot of us are higher level that I wish it was a bit more difficult.  Once the parade starts it‚Äôs basically the exact same every time and too easy/slow.  The first few times that I participated were a blast though.
---
Ive never become addicted to anything in this game and idk of any perks i have that would effect that as all my perks are combat,repair or weight related.
---
One thing that I‚Äôve noticed is that you have junk shield in. I don‚Äôt see much builds with junk shield because I feel there are usually better perks. For example adamantium skeleton which when maxed will make you take no additional limb damage
---
Hillarious. Thank you for sharing :D
---
Yea it‚Äôs limited I just bought it so idk the time
---
Where does that Rocket Mooneye mask come in because I just saw one at my most recent Fasnacht Parade event (got my fourth Giant mask!)
---
I think sometimes when you start the game up on a new server you lose your addictions?
---
And if you play alone you should use line wanderer and you can easy swap it to sometime else if you join a team
---
Which platform are you? I am on Xbox and only see the summer one. 
---
Yup. I believe they‚Äôre all under endurance and my END is super low so it‚Äôs not like one snuck in by accident :) 
---
just had a convo on PC with the parade group and out of the 20 people there nobody has seen one or heard of one dropping either.
---
Ooh - that‚Äôs worth trying. Thanks. 
---
Progamatically a random number will never be 1. 0 to .9999999999 only. :(
---
Awesome! Thanks!

Headquarters for enclave inside white springs

I can sell you a zealots Gatling plasma if you want
---
Witch hunting.
---
Okie dokie, thank you!
---
Loss the addictions or lose the progress toward an addiction or both? I server hop a lot so this may be part of the problem. 
---
Get a grip.
---
Thank you. I appreciate the information. Hopefully we'll confirm/debunk the myth
---
Yes everyone was donating to the box it was one of the objectives. I‚Äôve ran it twice and had the same issue both times.
---
You can turn them into Phantom Devices, which might be more useful in PvE. Haven't played around with those much though.
---
The problem in PvE is that they're not much use in an emergency: If you're surrounded by ghouls, they don't care if you go invisible. If you pop it earlier it might keep you in hidden/caution for longer, but it's hard to predict that you'll need it.
---
Sort of, yes.. even with the stacking foundations trick though this was the only way to get an aligned half step up and get the steps to work in between (they're stubborn *lol*)
---
U want to hear the truth?
---
Haven't played in months, sorry to hear this nonsense is still happening. AAA games used to make devs take pride in their work. But quality just doesn't matter much anymore to most devs. I think mostly it's down to publishers forcing bad products out for money, but when people like Howard espouse it, it's equally on the devs at that point.
---
Anyways, good luck to you all. I may be back eventually but I'm sorry to hear fans are still dealing with these issues. 
---
Is that the one I have to buy?
---
Sounds like the same kids on Xbox earlier , was in my camp fixing weapons and armor when I hear my camp being destroyed from out side , I go down and what do you know , two decent level players 191 and mid 70‚Äôs we‚Äôre destroying it. when I approached them ( me on pacifist mode I got kill by in one shot by some explosive shotty. I am a level 145  casual player with around 450 to 500 hours in game and this is the first time anyone has done this so I guess I made it pretty far. The only thing I complain about is if your gonna grief ppl be a man/women and do 1v1 in pvp cause once I asked for that I took both out in 1 shot repeatedly then it was back to he gang up lol. There will always be these types of players I guess! 
---
I just shut my Xbox off, unplugged it all, reconnected loaded it back up and it happened 7 more times. Since I started counting I‚Äôm literally at 20/20 so I‚Äôm giving up. 
---
If only NightsDouche were there to protect you, none of that would happen. But alas, NightsDouche was re-suspended. 
---
Lol
---
yes or you can buy the plans there too. I got lucky and got it on a supply drop once.
---
Today on BunkerBusters!
---
Honestly, the weight system they have is stupid and perks cards to reduce weight is not immersive or lifelike at all.
---
They need to scrap the weight system, at keast for stash. It should be set to a certain number of unique items. IE seperate ammo stacks are counted as 1, stacked meds count as 1 and guns and armour pieces are 1 each.
---
This should fit in with their concerns for server stability, even though i have high doubts that properly managed large inventories have a noticeable impact on server performance...
---
Not me, I started a new character after a 2 month break to give it another try and have fun again so no, not everyone has one.
---
Here‚Äôsat p
---
I‚Äôm with you on this, but I think it‚Äôs down to how we play rather than the quality of the event. 
---
I can‚Äôt help but find the ‚Äòmost efficient‚Äô way to do things, and I have a ‚Äòroute‚Äô around the event that tags most, if not all 5 protections and delivering their requests as you find them. 
---
Figuring everything out the first few times was awesome, and I was very happy to see a megasloth at the end, but everything gets stale with repetition. I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre grinding for the rare masks?
---
You have to do the Dailies from Biv. 
---
I‚Äôm in no way trying to belittle you here or talk down, please understand that, and I‚Äôm sorry you get killed like that in such a negative way. 
---
Not trying to get downvoted to Reddit hell for not riding the anti-PvP train.
---
But please understand that PvP isn‚Äôt griefing, for better or for worse this is an intended game mechanic and labeling players (though not the nicest nor most honorable among us) as griefers is a growing problem of its own.
---
Right? Like its 100% not worth doing the event to dig for those rare masks Right now. Who knows how many hundreds of thousands of event completions have been done to date and there are like 2 or 3 reported drops. More people than that accessed the dev room so it kinda proves nothing.
---
Try restarting the game, then it should update the shop.
---
It‚Äôs a LOT better now, I recommend buying. Most bugs are fixed and they are adding new content so there is tons to do.
---
If you do take workshops, make sure you regularly stash all your junk. They are decent XP, but you'll lose all the junk you're carrying if anyone does bother griefing you.
---
Go all out and see what you can get out of it
---
If you go to Fayetteville, NC, it's closer to "Fateville."  Then again, you've got the wags who call it "Fayettenam" due its proximity to Fort Bragg, so...
---
pm
---
Endurance yup, I mean shit, try taking all of them off just for assurance. I get addicted after 3-4 of the same chem in a short span 
---
Ok. Obviously I dont mean literally every single individual in the entire player base. Y'all act like you've never heard someone say everybody has (insert anything here). 
---
Trying not to buy it l. Thank for the info tho!
---
Me too.  It's probably what comes from knowing too many graphic designers...
---
You crafted 180k rounds over three weeks...60k a week on average we shall say...with rank two of ammosmith it costs 10 lead and 40 steal to make 180 .50 cal rounds, how many hours did you spend farming for all the lead and steel you would need? 
---
That‚Äôs how I understood it yes, so if one of those rare masks spawn or rare plans for something cool could drive up secondary market to highest prices seen yet.   Wonder what the most expansive FO76 item has been so far? 
---
Lead nodes in excavator armour give 4 ore each, which is 10 lead not including super duper procs. There are many many nodes in the ash heap i have memorised.
---
I also have a route i take for acid, i can farm 100+ every 30min and server hop to repeat on fresh spawns (i kill yao guai and snallys)
---
Lastly steel i use west tek. 500-600 steel per run, plus acid, lead and plastic to boot.
---
I play to craft, its my escape...
---
Do you have the grounded mutation?
---
See above
---
I believe it starts when the first person of a new server goes to helvatia.
---
Yes I do.  Ugh.
---
They won't see your tag, reddit limits it to 3 tags per comment, more than that and it disables it. Just so you can't tag 1000 people at once.
---
Doot doodoodoot doot doot doot doot doodoodoot doot dooooo
---
Where do you get enough lead to make 180K worth of ammo. Please legit tell me cause I have like 189 lead in my stash lol. 
---
You on Xbox? Your last one sounded like how my most recent play through of the event with. It was sweet finally getting a pic with a bunch of other players. That pic is definitely a keeper 
---
Now this is what this game is made for.üòÅ
---
Very tempting... but I'm imagining some automated system picking up on "100 tech datas turned in in 3 hours, suspension!"
---
Everyone is hopping Fashcnaht Event probably. 
---
Yep, I‚Äôm grinding it.  I‚Äôve probably done it close to 30 times so far.  The event has me excited about the future of the game and the release of more challenging content for sure. I just wish that this one scaled the difficulty or maybe had a few variations of spawns to mix it up.  I haven‚Äôt even seen a bot die yet.
---
Y no ultracite?
---
Mine is @watsonxo :)
---
There you go.  I did the same thing and it makes a huge difference.
---
That‚Äôs an awesome piece though.
---
Go to hornwright site #3 and turn 180. Should see a red crane. Head towards that and on the wall near it is 8 lead nodes.
---
If you walk around the ash heap a few times, away from the poi's and near rock formations, that is the best place to check
---
Well technically the people of Helvetia came up with it IRL but I agree, the quest is a ton of fun and I think more community-oriented content would be of great benefit to the game! 
---
It is now for sale in the Atom shop.
---
I should be able to! Send me a message I‚Äôm not sure how much I have materials wise but I can try for ya!
---
Username is @watsonxo 
---
LOL.  It wasn't cheap.  I may either try to ditch Grounded or trade for an I/E lever or hunting rifle.
---
I have 10 luck and I only see 25% cores on frames. The other spawn types are normal, as far as I can tell. Seems more likely that they wanted to stop people looting all the cores from frames.
---
50 here. I loved every FO and I especially love having a camp, getting geared and heading out to finish a mission. I have only had a couple griefer idiots try and scam me, but most people have been super cool.  Like you when I come across someone attacking my base I just hop out and go grab a beer or dinner. 
---
If the people of Helvetia have a nuclear powered robot parade surrounded by monsters every hour I'll be there soon.
---
Oh man, this is bringing back telemarketing memories. We were selling to Hurricun that summer and our boss had quite a job to get people pronouncing it "properly."
---
Thanks! :)
---
I always find a can sitting in the bathroom sink at R&amp;G station south of Whitespring. 
---
Thank you! I love the moon man one, and was waiting for it to hit after I saw what was a coming up
---
I just messaged u bruh
---
That sucks, dude. I'd be giving up, too. Sorry. 
---
Fasnacht is a real thing, the masks and stuff are really cool. Obvi no robots though 
---
49+ times completed and 0 rare masks
---
Good luck stripping those mutations.
---
PS4. 
---
That's my only complaint. I was in the picture, not taking it, so I didn't get to see it. 
---
I wish there was a system that allowed players to share photos with any player in a picture. 
---
Wow thank you so much for the information  very helpful! 
---
Seriously. There are some people like "well duh that's what rare means!!" but come on. Even if the masks are *very* very *very* rare, there would still be a least a couple showing up on Market by now with people trying to get 20k caps for them.
---
PC
---
It‚Äôs difficult for limited stuff like this I guess. They have to make it accessible for everyone, and the power difference between ‚Äòaverage joe player‚Äô and ‚Äòfully geared from Reddit/discord trades‚Äô killing power is insane. 
---
I‚Äôd suggest ‚Äòhard mode‚Äô triggers in future events. Have an option to hack a level 3 terminal and disable the protectron weapon systems. Crank up the music to attract more enemies. Nuke zones actually scaling the event to max level would be the ‚Äòeasiest‚Äô way to do it, because it gates lower players out anyways, and anyone can nuke the event and ruin it for everyone as it is right now. 
---
I know it‚Äôs apples and oranges, but WoW found a way to scale monster HP across 25+ players of various levels so every player is actively contributing to the ‚Äòpool‚Äô of damage, but it feels like a challenge for everyone involved. I feel like Bethesda tried this with SBQ scaling to the amount of people in the area, but that bunker pretty hard. 
---
Oh yeah, bing
---
awesome thanks! yea i had a look and both of those perks would fit pretty nicely. Thanks again!
---
Happened to me the day after Patch 7.  They were just sitting loose in my inventory.  Both my Excavator and X01 helmets.  I had to put them back in my chassis.
---
As long as its constructive yes i don't mind :)
---
Done intentionally and yep 3 tries to get it done. It is pretty easy but takes time. Just like the DMV
---
I know, right?  Maybe I can give my friend a bunch of booze (real life and in game), grape mentats, sweet rolls and sweet talk her into spending some of her maxed caps.  LOL.  I can make speed demon and bird bones, but I don't think I can live without marsupial and healing factor.
---
Thank you for this info as well from me 
---
I actually still have one
---
The entrance to Raven Rock in FO3 is way wrong too.  I used to work there.
---
No problem
---
agreed but unlikely (talking by myself) because of the duper/mule mess :(
---
One of the best posts I‚Äôve readüëç
---
The Behemoth that spawns at Solomon's Pond drops them at an alright rate
---
Nah those are the goods.  
---
Lol good thing your not a crybaby i dont want kids anytime  soon. My name is PeachieBear. 
---
Yeah isn't that further north in the real world but FO 3 has it in the west?
---
Here's a great visualization:
---
https://i.imgur.com/oh7UHdu.png
---
I ran a poll in the thread on the front page, so far 172 responses with a total of 2041 events being run. 0 rare event masks.
---
I've just now put in the same request, explaining the issue. My hope is I have more success than you did. What I still can't figure out is why my username showed up normally after changing the linked email, but then reverted back to numbers once I pulled up the launcher. There's also been a delay in my ability to stay on top of this with work and a few other life things acting up. 
---
An increase in players experiencing this problem is somewhat uplifting. Raising awareness and all, like you said.
---
Will keep you updated! o/
---
Same thing happened to me at my camp after taking the helmet off to wear a fasnacht mask. When I went to put it back on my armor... gone. Hoping when I get back online it will appear in my inventory again. 
---
Not really. Enemies can spawn inside locked areas anyway and nobody can actually steal anything from you. The most locked doors do is encourage people to bust your doors. 
---
Thanks man, I'll try that
---
Mine aren't even in my inventory or stash. They are just gone.
---
Hmmm, time to drag out the ol' Excavator again. Thanks. Good luck on your account troubles. 
---
I lock mine on principal.
---
But I just leave it open all the time anyway.
---
30 for 30. I‚Äôm done playing this game lol because that‚Äôs pathetic. Bethesda is awesome at driving their core ‚Äúfan‚Äù base away. IMO this game is a complete and utter disgrace and not from this issue alone. But yea, I enjoyed it for about 5 minutes until problem after problem occurred. I literally just wasted 2 hours walking up to an elevator, opening the door and trying to go to the mezzanine level 50+ times and got kicked out every single time without flaw so atleast they‚Äôre good at something, and that‚Äôs fucking up
---
Got one now and not an ‚Äòangry Gollum‚Äô looking thing in sight. 
---
They're also lightweight üëç
---
Trash cans at train stations. Equip ‚ÄúCan Do.‚Äù
---
Kool Aid manning the wrong guys walls is a fast way for your camp to have no walls.
---
Yeah, makes sense. Cheers. 
---
Lol. I live in south Brisbane so it‚Äôs just habit for me. 
---
but what if they were, and you accidentally disposed of them without noticing?
---
Yeah I don't understand it myself. I work hard to make a nice looking location, people might as well get to see it. It's not like they can rob my items since all stash boxes are personalized, and if they're the sort of people who would want to mess the place up they're not going to care if a puny lock is in their way.
---
I can't remember, it's been years since I played, but the whole layout of the tunnel entrance, (only being one is an issue) was way off.  I looked all over for the places I knew of, but I guess that's not something you could legally put in there.  Would have been cool to be able to explore the real place in game.  
---
Camp David wasn't on the game either, but it is pretty close too.
---
That depends on the precision of the floating point number they use. If they use, day, single precision floats, there is a 1 in 10^8 chance of rolling the rare masks, which is definitely impossible. 
---
Completed it 6 times so far, 3x witch, 1x soldier, 1x giant mask. One completion didn't reward a mask. I really want the beret.
---
How did he get the goblin mask? Any ideas?
---
I don't put them on because what the point? Nobody can steal anything, and as you said if someone really wants to they can smash their way in. I also spend a lot of time building my camps and I want other players to come visit it and make use of my benches and everything else. The only thing I lock are my resource extractors, and even then it's just a level one lock to make then wanted if they pick it. Again, if someone really wants that 14 lead they're going to take it anyway but at least I can put a bounty on them for it.
---
The only issue I've had with the event, is getting disconnected right before the end. Really shows why we need a rejoin last server option.
---
I think i can craft them, but even with a prime mod, it won't be as good as a legendary. I have a 3* executioner  prime gatling plasma, the thing melts scorched beasts.
---
The same to you, pal! 
---
Thanks, other methods that dont require smelting and acid are: can chimes - the prison (forget its name since its been so long, thanks Beth) and top of the world.
---
Paint  cans - watoga school, west tek roof, whitesprings maintence sheds (theres also a ton of rat poison at WS)
---
Lead is easy, as an ammo crafter my issue is steel. Good luck on your resource hunt
---
Just practice at it. I think you're asking too much, there needs to be some type of trade off for being invisible. And if you can see a glowing dot, why wouldn't any other enemy be able to see it as well?
---
And on my last run i got soldier. Still no baret thom
---
I like your ideas.  Still, this event was some of the most fun that I‚Äôve had in the game so far.  I think that we will get there.
---
Gonna have to agree with bodega, when you claim a workshop you have consensually agreed to partake in PvP in future just because PvP players are a rarer breed doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt exist. So if I were you I‚Äôd be ready to defend yourself when you take them. 
---
Not sure who you replied to, as you made a fresh comment, haha
---
Reactive plate is meh. Relies on you getting hit. Was huge issues with it triggering in pacifist mode last month+++
---
As for emergency protocol, practically useless unless you are already running a bloodied build
---
Could always hard dot your TV or monitor...
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I was thinking because I‚Äôve done the oh crap I‚Äôm detected and use them, only to find it ain‚Äôt fooling anything lol
---
How do you get someone to mod weapons/armor? Do you actually have to give it to them and hope they give it back? 
---
they were added recently. people have been getting all the paints from handing in technical data. the only one that hasn't been found yet to my knowledge is the sentinel paint. 
---
This, and I've been seeing my power armor revert to just the frame while entering and exiting, and then the armor reappears overtop again
---
I have not experienced this myself. But I have found some parts of the world to be very glitchy/lagging. 
---
- Servers are still disconnecting more than usual again. 
---
- Melee attacks are not registering and only getting hit markings on most enemies. 
---
- I had an event at the Red Rocket Mega Stop (Top NE) had a robot glitch underground and could not complete this event. Had to abandon it. 
---
Although I came back again and somehow completed it and recieved my reward. 
---
- Freddy fear's house of scares, when I arrived for the second time I fast traveled and was not existent. Like I had died but couldn't respawn. Relaunched only to be attacked by ghouls that hadn't properly spawned yet (ghost attack) and almost died. 
---
Have you tried rebooting your wireless router? - If on wireless connection. 
---
Restarting console/PC 
---
Unplugging all wires and reconnecting. 
---
Forgetting the network and reconnecting? 
---
I‚Äôm skeptical too.  The other thread on here has a couple of pics, so I don‚Äôt know.  If they are legitimately dropping right now then I would say that they over shot just how rare they are making these.  Maybe percentages will get higher as the week goes on?
---
Yeah I harvest most of those spots already. Just forgot about nodes some how.  
---
Exactly. All I hear is chitter chatter. I want substantial evidence.
---
I think both? I know I lose mine every time. 
---
That was the first one I got. It kinda reminds me of Hotline Miami. 
---
Nice! Good work. That's some pretty damning evidence. Its shaping up that it's all just gossip. Unless someone comes forward real evidence. I'm not believing the hype.
---
You can also go into 3rd person view when invisible, the targeting dot will be visible.
---
I didn't until I posted this and Im\_no\_rocket\_surgeon replied that the exact same thing happened to them. It seems to be caused by putting on Frasnacht masks.
---
Sameee
---
Lol what I give them the gun they go to the workbench and mod it and give it back 
---
Yesterday at Fashnacht I turned on my mic for the first time in months and was immediately met by a guy open-mouth chewing and breathing heavy into his mic. It was the most disgusting sound and it went on for a solid 30 minutes while we were waiting for the event to start. I eventually just turned my mic off and noped right the hell out of doing that again.  Thanks noisy lip-smacking wet mush eating noisy wheeze-breathing mic guy for making my stomach turn. 
---
OK I understand. We exaggerated. But such behavior can really lead to neurosis. Like the whole game.
---
10/10 would crash
---
Yes!! There goes that half hour I spent farming plastic
---
I was wondering about doing this, I had thought maybe it would be blocked as I haven't had time to launch a nuke since the update.
---
I don't think this could be considered griefing though, it is just part of being in a multiplayer game. If I do the event enough, the thought a nuking all those masked marching robots is hilarious, especially if you timed it out to happen when the event was in process.
---
I was at the event last night &amp; some guy was trying to talk to, there was a good 15 people. Nobody, not even me responded, it was just awkward thinking about how they tried to talk to everyone but nobody responded. I guess we just have different experiences. I took a break from the playing the game @ launch to now...so yeah.
---
Somebody call Robin Leach
---
I have only one Beret. As of now, I have all the items that are supposedly appearing, as well as both the new recipes, but I haven't got all the CAMP plans yet.
---
Could you share where the goblin mask images came from?
---
You all read the data mine thing right? The rare mask drop list is bugged. The TWO screenshots of masks supposedly gained could be dodgy.
---
The way they handle bans atm id be cautious too. Most bans are automatef and their system is very flawed
---
Hey I gave the shotgun to my buddy my bad I was gonna sell it to you 
---
What if u travel to that location close to harpers
---
Suspended not banned, we will be back and will come with a force you have never seen in game LOL they should pay me for this... 
---
I'm pretty sure the devs confirmed that they're just broken RNG loving jackasses.
---
Oh that's very awesome, thanks!
---
Yeah that I figured. Especially the 1 with Chinese writing. That's been around for more than a month
---
I took them while trading with the player that had the mask.
---
Yeah. Like the "do a think while under the affects of this beer you haven't u nlocked yet" quests from last week. Fuuuck that shit. 
---
50. Cal user here. Can confirm accumulating that amount of ammo over a three week period is not easy. I spend my days farming lead and steel and just no, it's not feasible unless your full time job plus overtime is this game. Not saying you cheated, but of you accomplished that then yes, Bethesda should audit your account.
---
6 times no rare
---
Everyone's is so quick to turn their backs and judge people or situations they know nothing about. Thus the comments on this post
---
The moon mask is out already. I just got it. 
---
Hey, I have the URGE to spend stupid money on bullshit. I, personally, have the self control to RESIST that urge. 
---
Not everyone can say the same, and the manipulative methods used by bethesda in their storefront TARGET that demographic. 
---
I'm just saying, if you think that their methods are acceptable, you're just...flat out wrong. 
---
plastic, steel, and asbestos
---
There‚Äôs also the rare fasnacht beret
---
Someone on PS4 posted a SS of someone with the old man winter on in the market. I just want the skull one!
---
I'm constantly drunk
---
Chameleon isn‚Äôt for close range aiming. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs stealth boys are for. Chameleon is for long range targets. Killing them and not breaking cover. Moving break the chameleon effect anyways. Your going to move if the first place so yeah. 
---
When I'm running a bloodied build, I need to be at 20 hp for maximum damage boost. Slap damage is 5hp. That's 4 hits. 
---
I'm stating this as a fucking _fact_ as someone who's been murdered by sociopathic douchebag griefers_multiple fucking times_. 
---
It's like in real life.  If you have a red dot sight on your rifle, it's visible from behind but not in front.
---
I wouldn't trust someone I dont know to do that haha. Too many ass hats out there.
---
Yeah there's about nine masks you can obtain through the Faschnacht event, then the summer and moon masks through the Atom Shop. The rare ones are harder to get so far I've gotten the soldier, toothy man, and owl. I've traded my beret for the giant mask, so currently hoping I can get the witch mask too. But I have three toothy masks and two owl masks now.
---
The "Old Man Winter" and "Goblin" mask photos don't prove anything. Before the "dev room glitch" was patched and people accessing it were banned, some of these masks got into circulation.
---
Did u know there are market subs for this game?
---
Can you link. Did they post a picture.
---
You're not "nice" you're a fucking sociopath. 
---
It's not against the rules. It's still a dick move and it makes you a sack of shit. 
---
No problem. I wonder if the 'rare' masks the protectrons wear will be unobtainable?..
---
scroll on the featured page. its the first one on the second page

You could just mute him alot earlier. Or say hey dude we dont need to hear you eating.

Well damn. Looks like I should play more. Haven't heard about him before. I am roughly 15 hours in. Haven't played much since the other night. I like a lot of the improvements so far.
---
I wish there was way more of everything to fight. There needs to be at least one area where they just keep spawning almost as fast as you can kill them. Hell they can keep the XP! I just want to fight! 
---
I've checked many times while heart of the swamp was going on to no avail. I've only found them while I was doing the quest you need them for. It was getting frustrating when I needed them to craft a Pickaxe Pilsner, turns out you can just find one in the world and it counts as crafting it. 
---
It's a event in a low level area, I've never been to one where the mobs were above level 30, and there are LOTS of low level characters. 
---
Your chosen roll is "sociopath sack of shit". I get it. You probably have some dead puppies in your basement, there's probably a couple of police reports for sexual assault with your description, yada yada. 
---
Were people able to cheat to get these previously through the whole dev room thing?
---
Tone it down a little. Getting so defensive just makes you look like a guilty douche. If you aren‚Äôt one of those guys, why get so offended over something that‚Äôs just ‚Äúdifference of opinion‚Äù? Ignore it, move on, and open a dictionary so you can look up the word ‚Äòhyperbole‚Äô. 
---
His issue is obviously with the trolls and griefers, not literally everyone running these builds. 
---
Lol. I wasn‚Äôt even upset.  I was laughing at it. I thumbs upped it. 
---
Game luck high, life luck low
---
What kind of stairs are they? Do they turn white when you try to delete?
---
I know bloody mess will add a little damage, but I think that‚Äôs about it
---
My dailies are buggy too. Maybe about once a week I get to go to Camden Park... But that's about it. I used to get Queen Of the Hunt, but that one doesn't proc for me anymore. 
---
You can have yours on. I don't want mine and I don't want to hear the random crap going on with other people.
---
I just finished a run of the event and got... nothing. No reward at all. :(
---
Can confirm, happened to me last night. Even persisted after leaving the server and joining another one.
---
This
---
Flaming chainsaw with a sackhood. I chased noobs oh so slowly.. walking behind them.. the roar of the chainsaw their only motivation. 
---
They kept logging out. :(
---
the addiction is definitely broken in this game i have only become addicted to something once and that was using like 20 of them
---
Neither of those things are worth the hassle, really. Cronchboi was enough ;)
---
I am, thus my negative tone. Not trying to be a dick I am truly just frustrated... I am bashing the hell out of the event but made several friends so I agree it's socailly fun. The event would be really cool if it had some really tough bosses that we hard to take down together... 
---
I was thanking anyone who chimed in.   Well that‚Äôs the thing. I‚Äôm trying to get into melee bloodied power armor build. Just not sure how to do it well. Should I make another post for that? Haha. 
---
I‚Äôm not very fluent in reddit tagging people. But thank u randomletters. Input is appreciated. 
---
Yep
---
She went back to her homeland. 
---
Skyrim. 
---
I found a camp that was locked, but the workbenches where too close to the window...
---
Magically teleported inside!
---
Iv been trying to get a response for three months. 
---
Well yeah. They have to do things for the sake of the game. They condensed an entire state into like 16 square miles. Sacrifices had to be mad.e
---
Claycalebrissy though my son has an alt so it's not always me on.
---
also remember that even if it is a roll between 0 and 1 we have no idea how many decimal places are used so it could theoretically be a 1 in 100k chance.
---
Chameleon is the most important at close range.  I could wear a bright pink suit of power armor and stay in stealth at 200+ yards all day long, but I want chameleon/stealth-boy effects for CQC battle in cramped interiors and tunnel fighting.  I'm a rifleman.  I'm not going to swap out to a combat knife when entering West-Tek and clearing it of lvl 40-60 super mutants.  I'm going to use a close quarters rifle that I have extensive training with, the same as special ops do in real life.
---
Without being able to see my optics, chameleon effects are useless.
---
If this is in reference to Fasnacht event, the more bots left alive the higher your odds of getting a Mask and plans are, so people insta-killing everything is actually working your favor. If your talking about farming legendaries, then I agree.
---
LOL.  That's actually the best idea I've heard so far.
---
I can tell people are getting bored with this because I've done about 15 or 20 runs now and every time I hop servers and run into town after the event has already taken place, people start trying to PvP me lolol
---
Server hopped for over 30 minutes. Join event and complete it to recieve 0 rewards with 5 surviving bots and then the game crashed.
---
Thanks Bethesda for valuing my limited time.
---
We had a fight earlier where she went back to hell. We were doing real good. She regenerated, got her back down to 2/3 and she dive bombed right through the map. Half the players were using the ??? Emogi and literally everyone stopped firing, so we knew it wasn't some sort of individual lag issue. Fast forward a couple minutes and she thankfully popped back out and was promptly killed.
---
The plans for the witches costume still drop.  It took me two days and a couple hours to get it.  First time the witch spawned only the hat plan.  Many server hops and some time later got the dress plans too.  The skeleton costume is worth more to sell though.  Just fyi.
---
Also Heard Today: Nuking Helvetia makes the Fasnacht Parade Event more challenging and more rewarding for higher level players!
---
You put u/unikron08
---
u/    Whomever you want to tag
---
Never really got into the bloodied build myself
---
Probably an idea to make a new post, or you can use the search bar the top of the page
---
How is your lever action rifle such high damage? Mine has almost the exact same mods (different scope) and it only does 130 damage... (I have 7 perk points into upping rifle damage too, but maybe you have all 9?)
---
500 caps for a mask that gives you no benefits whatsover
---
*cough* cheapskate *cough*
---
I dont know what kos is but I googled it. I was in whitespring the other day and nobody was kissing on site. 
---
This post brought you by dying before gaining control of my character, and the letter A for annoyed at dropping my beeswax and porecelan steins.
---
[check this site out, will probs help](https://nukesdragons.com/) 
---
No, because that is not what the devs said. All they said was that your chance at ANY mask depends on the number of bots that survive which is directly backed up by the data mining. When all bots survive its a 100% chance for a mask and it drops with each dead bot. 
---
I had the same issue with the beeswax and radtoad eggs.  I kind of think it was already completed, but hadn't caught up.  
---
I still get the rad scorpions and Deathclaws all the time at Whitesprings
---
That wouldn't be an issue if there was a player hub. You shouldn't have to rely on an outside forum in order to trade just to complete an event. 
---
Mothman told me to do it
---
On PC. Same here. Watch my CAMP materialize piece by piece every time after patch. Get frozen crafting stuff sometimes - all controls dead and the crafting animations and sound keep cycling. I can only quit using task manager or if fo76 won't allow task manager to display I log out of windows and log back in.
---
ü§∑ lotta speculation out there, been trawling the boards all day because I can't find more than the ones everyone else has, because I've got like 4+ of most masks by now except the rare ones. Maybe it switches halfway through the event week?
---
9 rifleman and bloody mess, plus 3 tank killer, 3 glow sight and 5 adrenaline for extra boosts.  I only use rifles.
---
That's always been the case for Watoga. After Mayor For A Day the robots to attack you anymore. If you attack a robot only the one you've attacked will fight you.
---
And imo dont look that great
---
I'll have to do this. I used to kill sentries a lot on my way to the top of the world but had so many I stopped.  Guess it's time to rinse and repeat that method again
---
My brother in-law uses scotch tape with a red dot on it.
---
YES!  I finally found a t60 right leg at Firebase Hancock in the bog! 
---
Sounds like they aren‚Äôt dropping then.  I‚Äôm assuming either a bug or they didn‚Äôt plan to give them out until towards the end of the event.  Both of those possibilities kind of suck...
---
What did I do wrong
---
Did you not read the last line. I did say it is the reason i play. I craft ammo, its what i do. And im damn good at it
---
A whole drive through and everything Haha. I love it
---
Accumulating the materials to make that much *excess* .50 cal ammo.  OP isn't saying they made 180k ammo in three weeks but that they made so much ammo they had 180k bullets in storage.  
---
I ran that through google translate, it closed my gmail account and deleted the password...
---
Shows up as an event yes. And sometimes also a server type event message pops up. 
---
As for location. Its super close to the overseers camp. A tad north and head east.  If ya get to the crashed plane on the cliff ya went to far
---
They should be better than this, this kind of customer support shouldnt be coming from a company like that. Yet people still defend them? Why?
---
If you were on Xbox I was there. Fun watching the ???? Pop up. 
---
And the ability to manually enter numbers on console for price and quantity. These are easy things Bethesda. Not like making a fridge work.
---
Adrenaline seems kinda useless ( maybe take just 1 rank of it) but other than that looks nice
---
All I can make is the milk machine! :'(
---
Don't ask me to account for Bethesda's goofy gameplay design lol.
---
Consider this another thing they should steal from diablo 3. Ain't no reason why everyone in the vicinity can't all comb through corpses and get what they need regardless if they tagged or not.
---
This is that same kinda autistic gameplay design as that server hopping bullshit
---
I absolutely know what a spoiler is, and revealing all of the information for an event in this fashion (data mining) while people are actually trying to figure it out manually (by playing the game) fits the bill
---
I was one of the people that responded to your poll. I've now run 57 total events with no rare masks. I haven't seen anyone with a rare mask.
---
Yeah i was! We were about to log off and i seen the callout here. Packed up the weapons and bounced servers. Never saw her do that before! My buddy is still new to queen fights, i had JUST said we were doing great and then poof. Silence....
---
Just wanna say Thanks, this comment is still helping people to this day lol
---
No i made that 180k over 3 weeks. And you can make more, quicker, with a team since im solo. 100k for a baseline on auditing for ammo is stupid. It isnt alot
---
Equip the perk that allows you to search food containers for extra canned goods. You will get one after searching enough. 
---
Ehm you spent 30 minutes getting annoyed instead of muting him within a minute or two.
---
Yep, i have several photos after discovering it. Wanted to show my friend, but he could still see my head.
---
Yes I did the event twice and got the legendary it was a nocturnal one star golf club, kinda uselessüò≠
---
If only you were on xbox.... i have 30+ in my box
---
The moon mask is on sale so let's see if the uncommons start dropping
---
Throw molotovs. Fire works wonders on mr sloth
---
Yup. All I want is any sort of communication. Tell me I‚Äôm gone for good? Ok at least I know. Scrub the account? Ok. All I want is my username back. But nothing at all. All it does is keep me paying for two psn accounts. 
---
My friend couldn't see my head 
---
Yes I did. I deleted it after I realised that. I'm a new player and didn't know it was in the shop haha
---
Thanks for it, but im no rush i will wait my luck or will get the plan when they fix vendor list.
---
Yup. Saw all the explosive damage going off and her health not moving and I knew she‚Äôs was thinking of pulling a scum move. Saddest part was the sloth that never meat piled. 
---
You can go invisible in real life? That's cool
---
I used to dislike PA(well still do), mainly used it on nuke zones where I had to. T-60 is moderately cheap to repair, but since I crafted excavator, I've only had to repair one leg part once. I've had the excavator like over a month now, and I play quite a lot, well over 600 hours by now I think. I crafted it with about intellgence of 10 or so, so it wasn't 200% health initally, but over 100%, maybe about 140%.
---
While I did that, I repaired few other parts which were 40-60%, as the repair perk pushes them all up to 200%. The nominal repair costs of excavator are pretty cheap too with the relevant perk, but it seems to be it's actually cheaper beacause it's more durable. I don't know if my T-60 was less durable than normal, as it was looted, but both were max level of course.
---
And I've used it far more often than T-60, because it gives such an huge carry weight boost partially due to glitch, partially due to design. Hopefully that weight gltch gets fixed so Ill be happy normal armor user again, and use PA only when needed with nuke zones. Body is strong but the mind is weak, when offered 200 lbs extra capacity.
---
I would recommend Excavator over T-60 any day. If I would have known how good Excavator is, I would have went to get it far earlier. I think using jetpack would be a good reason for T-60, but then, you might as well as go X01 or Ultracite. Im yet to collect my Ultracite PA from the quest. Don't fancy that much, since any PA is so strong anyway to conventinal armor, and the disadvantages of PA are all the same.
---
Interesting. It's so nice that everything just works.
---
That was weird too. We hung around for a while and it just... stood there, on our screens at least.
---
It did for everyone. A few of us tried to get bloody mess to proc to break the body but no luck this time. 
---
Ayyy, awesome! Glad to hear you found it!
---
My wife is a college professor, and she tells me that critical thinking and inference are lacking in today's youth.  I didn't believe it.
---
Ah okay thank you  for the advice im guessing its just rare then 
---
Thats all i want as well. They keep stating they will communicate better and be more transparent but i am yet to see this. The patch notes are still incomplete and stealth changes are still happening. They say they fix things when they dont. But yet the community still praises them for their work
---
 the same as special ops do in real life...LMFAO!!
---
At least this one is catchy. The Galleria has the real insanity music
---
Yes, I read it. I also read your farming techniques. They are inefficient. Wasting acid on smelting ore? There are better ways to get lead, your acid should be going to making gunpowder because the mutants don't drop enough to sustain a good ammo production operation.
---
That's true but I feel like low levels feel very left out if everything gets killed before they even manage to get a weapon out. Sure, the masks are good but I believe people have more fun being a part of a group and feeling like they're contributing, than some mask that they did nothing to earn.
---
Kill on sight?
---
While im not sure, it seems like there is still duping going around
---
Oh gosh. Here we go...
---
Yep, fuck this.  Arguing over the internet is for idiots.  I respect your opinion if you respect mine.
---
Better ways to get thousands of lead solo? Nah nodes are the best if you know their spots. Acid is easy to farm, as i have said in other posts my issue is steel. I can farm everything else easily but steel is the biggest bottleneck.
---
hi
---
Hi
---
Future reference, you could have just stayed on one server, I haven't ever had to wait too long for the event to start and a little pup up appears to let you know it's starting. 
---
Also, you're the only single person who I can find who had an issue with receiving rewards. At what part of the event did you join it?
---
I have a second account I created to use as a mule. Never considered using it to use the perk card for experience. Does that mean the character has to be close by or just in the same world to get the experience?
---
So was fo4. 
---
Wait, this is a glitch? I applied the compensator or whatever it's called and just assumed it was from that.
---
Also, the ammo glitch is INCREDIBLY annoying. I would have thought they would fix it in this update but I guess not
---
Pm me this method!
---
But you already didn't respect my opinion. Instead you type some general statement about todays youth, which i have not been a part of for many years now. 
---
Like i said in my first comment, keep practicing at it. I also run a sneak rifle build and have no problem aiming. 
---
Which platform and how much you paying? I've got one, Im on Xbox. Lemme know what you have to offer, I'll be on in about 6 hours. 
---
I sent you a friend request in game.
---
exactly and Bessie is worth that 10% you cheapskate
---
And brahmin milk.
---
Maybe because it includes the brahmin, who knows? :D
---
You might have just possibly,
---
*just possibly here,*
---
missed the sarcastic joke.
---
*Guess that red dot sight wasn't a whole lot of help here huh?*
---
Camden park is broken
---
From Biv. Sometimes they unlock when you start the quest. Theres 2 others from a vendor thats a random encounter.
---
I'm pretty sure they nerfed Whitesprings. Glowies don't seem to be respawning when someone reloggs and might now be timer based instead.  Maybe 15 or so minutes between waves.
---
And this makes it way less lucrative for farming both experience and legendaries because you can't just force them like you used to. 
---
Running a silo used to be worth it when you could just relogg back with your friends and summon glowies but now it feels like too much work sometimes.  
---
As far as the SBQ, since the last patch that buffed her there's not really an incentive to fight her anyway.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but this should work with any duplicate helmet/mask. This also works with hats--if you have two and do various equipping and unequipping, the top half of your head will be bald.
---
I agree steel is the bottle neck, but you waste too much acid smelting the ore. The mutant drops can't sustain the operation, which you would know if you legitimately obtained that amount of ammo. 
---
Respawning same server?
---
I play on Xbox, is there anybody who is willing to sell or trade for an owl mask? I can also trade the giant, soldier or witch mask if  anyone would rather trade than just have me buy it.
---
Which skull one? I might have it and could give it to you.
---
My head disappeared while I was trying on masks at my camp. Like, Mr. Invisible with a floating beret.
---
If you have an alt account sometimes it effects it? Idk. I know I just recently made an alt before the newest update and started getting alot of atoms from stuff I remember doing previously after switching back to my main to complete fasnacht day, kill 76 scorched, or pick 76 flowers etc. 
---
Yeah I need that honey shine! Just making regular brew that gives just +1 Strength is lame.
---
Sorry, but I don't miss this at all. Today I had to listen to the very loud feedback of a Spanish speaking player (presumably, since I could hear the robots talking in Spanish) for the entire parade. It was blaring, I had to mute him after a good minute.
---
And yes, you can mute people. It looks some some people in this thread don't know that. It's annoying to bring up the social menu each time and click "recent" to scroll through whoever's being annoying, but it's better than just sitting there listening to them be annoying.
---
The cow is a nice ornament for your camp. I used to have one but got rid of her for more budget. Her only practical purpose was to farm the fertilizer to sell, but after awhile the extra caps wasn't enough to justify it for me. I suppose since the new patch her milk is a good incentive, but my glass cannon build doesn't require it.
---
Yup no official word on duping fix. I suspect duping is still possible and will always be possible via numerous exploits. I think after the ban wave, most dupers are more selective about what they dupe and how much. They won't catch the duper making 10k of shotgun shells and selling them then making another batch once inventory is low. So I'm assuming something like the jester's mask ever show up someone will dupe them and suddenly a bunch of people will suddenly be wearing them. They just need to keep quantities below BSG's radar.  
---
They will probably have some future quests with them. The legendary vendor is a mole miner after all.
---
Replying to a three month old comment eh? We figured it out, but thanks! 
---
Yeah, I felt kinda dumb about it too, for just assuming.
---
It says though that when they tried to ask him where he got it, they kept ignoring him. It was possible for people to get into the development room and masks were taken. Unless I see a video from an event or people personally posting about their find/experience, the lack of evidence is enough for me to think otherwise
---
I'm on xbox, if I happen to get another owl mask I'm happy to trade with you. I have the owl, toothy man and giant so far. Really want to get my hands on the moonshine mama and skull masks.
---
I think it's pretty clear to everyone by now that they're not dropping correctly though. They should probably extend the event tbh.
---
I desperately hope this isn't the case, because I need that beret. 1 day is not enough time to farm for rare drops for an event you can only do like once an hour.
---
De gustibus non est disputandum.
---
During the last two Fastnacht events I did before logging out, there were 4-5 unarmed builds running around in the "unarmed uniform".  Clown suit/cultist outfit/skeleton costume with a fastnacht mask/cultist mask/skeleton mask and either a deathclaw gauntlet or power fist.  They look basically the same, and none of them could stand still for longer than a second.  ADD is a character trait of the build.
---
They're the juggalos of 76.
---
I think you are right, that's how it looks like.
---
When someone first showed it and called it black, I thought that's pretty lame to be "black" when it's barely more dark, than light. Granted other games which have black paints, don't exactly always render as anywhere near black, only somewhat darkish.
---
Love this tryin to get the winter man mask myself
---
that wasn't the clip i was referring to.
---
[https://clips.twitch.tv/EasySolidDugongPogChamp](https://clips.twitch.tv/EasySolidDugongPogChamp)
---
Very excited to come by. 
---
That's what I have heard. I was hoping someone from bethesda would've commented on this issue recently
---
Are you sure? Dataminers seem to say the coding points to otherwise? That it's an integer-based problem? They're usually the ones who are right in these situations...
---
No, but I only hit Whitesprings once per server usually. I have about five places I hit per server and always get the full spawns when I go. After that I usually either go grab some workshops to get stuff I need, go visit the vendors... Do whatever events are available, and if I'm lucky enough to get a daily go do them. Then I server hop and repeat the process and get the full spawns again.
---
Are the shops still running 
---
I just feel like that would take a lot predetermination to know that the mask would be extremely rare in the first place, and than to not wear it or even show it to anyone until the event started.
---
Every side mission in the game works this way. There are specific checkpoints in all the missions. If you leave between checkpoints you lose some progress.
---
I think you may be right. That kind of sucks for anyone that gets the rare mask through legit gameplay
---
I'm talking about respawning like how the glowing ones used to respawn 
---
I remember this cave from beta good times
---
I dont sustain my gunpowder from them, you get a little yes. I never said it was my main source. Mutants are my main source of steel. Please read carefully before throwing accusations
---

---
Could you double check that? Because I haven't seen a single post with anyone claiming to have gotten the Jester, Goblin, Sun, Winter or Skull masks, and no one is selling them on the various trading subs. Either the drop rate is microscopic, or they're bugged, or they're intentionally unavailable.
---
Loved the setup! Bought a weapon for my buddy who was ecstatic and a number of smaller outfit items for myself (up to 227 out of 245 possible outfit items in my stash!) I‚Äôll definitely be keeping an eye out for your next market setup. Thanks!
---
Thanks.So no new content :(
---
1 tip is to not put your weapon away when defending an objective, run ahead where you think enemies might come from and start shooting them, your never gonna get everything but at least you feel like your helping somewhat
---
I‚Äôve done the event five times so far and haven‚Äôt seen it.
---
Na ps4 the ass hat didn't even bother with us literally stood in the back of the room then hopped on it as soon as we cleared it
---
I always love when they do the old radio serials too. They are so spot on, the music cues, the background sound effects, the announcer's voice. 
---
And I unabashedly love the old songs on the fallout playlists as well. 
---
What does the goblin mask look like? Cause I thought the Witch one was plenty gobliny. 
---
Unfortunately no, but we're less then three weeks away from player vending machines and new quests :)
---
They won't care, but yep.
---
Awesome, thanks. Keep me updated on that please.
---
Can you not repair the bots?
---
So the Old Man Summer mask in the atom shop is exclusive to the shop?
---
So how do you sustain your gunpowder of you're wasting acid on ore smelting?
---
Yeah, I almost feel guilty tagging the sloth...like...do I need another 1\* lvl 35 legendary?  
---
But I agree with the sentiment of this thread.  This timed event works well and brings people together.  
---
Yes. At this time, all Atomic Shop items are exclusive to the Atomic Shop.
---
I‚Äôll share mine with u when I get a chance.
---
Thanks, I wasnt sure because ive seen them selling the greaser jacket which ive found laying around in game
---
As someone who lives in WV locations being in the wrong spot doesn't bother me (though Morgantown not being much further north is kind of baffling to me).  It's the fact that some of the more populous areas of the state (Huntington and Parkersburg-Vienna-Washington) aren't really included.
---
It would have been cool to have some DuPont/Chemoursish area in a city setting and Huntington has the Marshall University (maybe make it Vault Tech State???).
---
I have no problem if I travel to the power station nearby.  In fact, that's what I usually do because of the headaches I have with direct travel. That's what I will probably do from now on.
---
Me and my buddy keep a bunch of plans for low level players who need them! My PSN is radiationdaddy - hit us up and we‚Äôll help you out!
---
I‚Äôm usually in parties these days on Xbox but I loved meeting new people and chatting with them! I miss it as well! I‚Äôve met some incredible people online over the years!
---
I got it for Xbox my gamer tag is TLF VileNeptun6 send me a message if you want it. 
---
I have been saying this for a while, Fallout 76 should be a no PvP social lounge. 
---
Yeah just go that way where u usually spawn at Harper's is boring anyway
---
Same happened to me earlier. Can confirm, it‚Äôs caused by removing the helmet while inside of the armor, and putting a mask on. I had to craft a new X-01 helmet and find a new T-51b helmet. I now take the helmet off before entering.
---
Actually, you can nuke Helvetica all you want. It's Helvetia that you should leave alone.
---
What exactly do you want to do? I wouldn't bank on a melee nerf, it's powerful but has significant drawbacks, just like bloodied. TSE was nerfed because there was literally no drawbacks to using it, and it trumped ever other build. 
---
But I want more lights, precious. 
---
Well you can have 3 now for the 10 percent if that makes you feel better.  More grenades and mines.
---
What can you do with the milk, anyway? 
---
Junk shield --&gt; bloody mess 
---
Ironclad ---&gt; Adamuntium , DR is pretty close to worthless. ( Damage reduction is king ) 
---
Kinda true, seems like feature that was okay on single player, got through into online AS-IS.
---
Cloth is no issue, safes for money. Acid is no issue, i have a whole path i run to collect it. I use yao guais and snallygasters mostly as there are locations guaranteed to spawn them. 100+ acid every 30min. This is just from what i have found running around by myself and with some help from a few friends on discord. Asking around more i could probably find more spots for all my resources and could potentially up my production even further.
---
Once i get my acc back i am more than happy to post all my spots and methods.
---
no, not at all. I sat there today with a few friends and literally did do nothing, all i did was walk  in a circle with the robots and still got the same rewards as everyone else. I also saw that the mask you get at the end off the quest is based on how many robots from the parade are alive at the end, and not by the contributions you make to the quest. to add i have done the event like 8 or 9 times now and it was always packed with more than half of the server so pretty hard to help on every step on the quest. 
---
its used in some of the new drinks
---
Last time i've done the event, the muties were comming at us nudes. Well, i don't know about others, but they were nude for me (on xbox). I wish i had taken a screen.
---
Oh by the way, they have no tiny weeny...
---
you have to be in the near to the quest then you can start it. 
---
Based on the Fasnacht events I‚Äôve done lately, I‚Äôd say ‚Äònot very‚Äô
---
It fills some hunger and thirst and heals a small amount of Rads. Also part of the White Russian recipe at brewing stations. 
---
Not a single locked door and you still won't get in my masterpiece
---
I didn‚Äôt go do to do it cause somebody nuked Helvetia so only high levels in power armors could enter the area. 
---
I, of course am a level 12. 
---
You probably won't like this post then......[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3m320/please\_dont\_nuke\_helvetica/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3m320/please_dont_nuke_helvetica/)
---
Not only do they mispronounce it (I assume), but they can't even spell it lol
---
Been there done that, my post also got removed for some reason
---
Wish i was on xbox lol.  Been looking for a little while
---
i dont think theirs a real way to stop dopping but making it harder/banning ppl plus the weight limits that are in place should greatly help with duping
---
I've had my camp just outside Hevetia since I started playing. It's a nice spot. I loaded in yesterday only to die from radiation before I could get my power armor on.  
---
It used to be such a nice neighborhood!
---
Why would anyone nuke a font? 
---
Pretty good low tech solution if your monitor doesn‚Äôt have built in toggle able sights
---
I prefer nuking Times New Roman or Arial
---
Im pretty sure it's fairly common if you want to do the event few times.
---
I wish more people saw it this way. Can‚Äôt wait for the new mode
---
Well, I hope you're not a duper and just have a good efficient ammo operation.. I hope you can return and we can compare notes and maybe go into business together. Cheers!
---
[How I'd personally rock it](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=ec346a7&amp;d=s52si2se2sj2pd2pk2pp2pl2ej2i42l71ic2lt2c72lu1sg1a03au2am2&amp;w=&amp;n=). 
---
Key notes on your build:
---
1. Like you pointed out already, it'll be decent at a few things but good at nothing. You're making this character stealth melee so it's up close and personal, but also stealth ranged so it reaches out some but then it ALSO relies on junk for protection with (assuming) no junk reduction perks/skills. 
---
2. Ironclad lvl 5 alone isn't going to cut sans power armor. And even though you have junk shield in there, that's assuming you have enough junk to get the full 30 and you'll lose it if/when you die. You could just as easily slap on a piece or two of Vanguard or Bolstering (or even a mix) legendary armor or two and be better off, as you're always to stay alive unless you're playing Unyeilding or Bloodied builds.
---
3. Unless you're playing in a team a lot, Tenderizer is alright to run at level 1 and only after Lone Wanderer. Dead damage is no damage. 
---
4. You're going to have a helluva time managing your weight. A fully modded handmade will weight in excess of a super sledge, and it still needs ammo (which has weight). Not to mention food, water, stims and chems. Assuming you're going to offset it with power armor, fusion cores weight 3 lbs a pop and the suit weighs 10 and power attacks burn through cores. In short, you have to consider it all when it comes to the builds, not just damage.
---
5. Play how you like. This isn't meta by any stretch, and you won't be doing any solo SBQ hunts with it, but if you want to play as a Snake Eyes in a nuclear wasteland, do that. The best build doesn't mean anything if you're not having fun with it.
---
do you still need one, i got one that im willing to trade, im on xbox 1 as well hit me up here on in xbox SpoonierMonkey in my XBOX live. I will be on game in like 8 to 10 hours, work sucks
---
Oh man it totally works, only outside of power armor though, in PA it‚Äôs always a swing 
---
There are often variations. The Greaser Jacket outfit in the Atomic Shop is different than the one that's in the game. Unfortunately, they don't have a full website like ESO where they show everything nice and large.
---
Haha yeah, when I start talking to someone I always creep a little bit. I also played a decent amount of 76 so I thought I would chime in. Even if it was a dead conversation. That game was the entire reason I made a reddit account and stopped lurking. Then it bombed. Hard. Todd Howard. Something something skyrim. 
---
If you want my acid route i can send you a shitty map i have. As for helping each other out, i'm in Australia so the timezone difference will most likely be a pain.
---
once you are close to the event area, get on your pipboy got to the data tab, event and it should the the quest along with the timer off how long you need to wait.
---
you cant use the perk card or you just dont see it when you lvl up
---
always been there, the enclave did a few messed up things to get the bunker to defcon 1 before they finally released the SB on the wild thats when the bunker got to defcon 1 and we are able to lunch nukes.
---
I think the reason this happens is because when you use iron sights you are literally using the visible parts of the gun model to aim. So in order to use them the sights would need to stay visible, which would give you away. In PVP I use a short night vision recon scope. You can get a mark on a target and then shoot people in the head who think they are hidden, and those headshots work wonders for people you can't VATS crit. Anything too close for the short scope and I can just hip-fire.
---
It's an alright game. It's just not what most fallout fans wanted, but I still play it a couple times a week I guess. 
---
screenshot or bust
---
thanks :)
---
I agree with this 100% percent. It would be amazing if there was an ongoing quest  where players would have to build a large community hub over multiple patches.
---
i used them, they are a few achivements tied witht the them i think finding them and I know for sure thier is an achivement for using the magazines and bubble heads
---
Wild guess: maybe the game has issues?  I know there are a lot of whiners out there, but the people I've played with, on wide variety of system and connection qualities are all suffering similar issues: disconnects, hangs, CTDs, and audio issues.
---
I've played like 40 fasnacht events, almost all ended with five robots alive. I've seen/talked to more than 100 players. Non of them have gotten any of the "rare" masks. One guy just told me he saw a player with an old man winter mask (the blue one) that's the first hearsay I've personally heard since the event started. Didn't see it though.
---
Everyone on reddit is scrambling to figure out how rare they are, if anyone has gotten them. How it works.
---
Devs say it's possible and I believe them. I feel like the odds are set way to low though. They have to be seeing all these posts. We are dying to collect them! 
---
I don't feel that it is fun mechanic to require me to play hours a day in the very off chance I may acquire one of these coveted masks. We all theoretically have lives, jobs and families, school, etc.
---
I have the X-01 jetpack. It took me 17 hours of searching to get it. (No exaggeration) the odds are so low. 
---
Bethesda, please please please consider making the masks less rare.
---
We want to collect them all, and I'm willing to grind, but it's depressing to think I could grind all week long and not ever get any of them.
---
If there's some secret math to make it more likely, please tell us plainly how it works, because we are not getting it.
---
What do you want to trade for?
---
Better but still bad 
---
Pete Hines has in an interview they did not want vehicles in the game because they want to people to explore.
---
Seinfeld reference. Kramer tells Jerry he's going to build different "levels" in his apartment, but as Kramer usually doesn't follow through on his goals, the levels are never built.
---
I suggested this for a boss battle. A full team of player boards vertibirds to fight a very large four armed, two headed super mutant. 
---
It's also worth mentioning that if you have unlocked the Fasnacht sausage recipe all small animals will drop intestines
---
I also just noticed you need it for the new donut. 
---
/rmarket76 has a screen shot of some one on ps4 wearing the old man winter mask you can see it there. I did not take a screen shot of the guy wearing the sun mask. Did not now how rare it was at the time.
---
You need to find a number in your special that can accommodate your needs. I'm not trying to be a gangster at one but a versions player that can change my play and still be successful. I run a bloody build and yes I could lean a certain way and push/transfer special but I have it balance to were I can change if I want too. I have maxed perk cards and also single so sometimes I want bloody mess at 3 and other times I want serendipity at two and bloody mess at 1. Same goes for agility, I can use all the perks that benefit me outside PA or I can swap out if I'm in PA to fight the queen. I just don't want to lock my special in to one build. I like change too much. Bloody is a pretty awesome experience and it's changed my gameplay tremendously. With sneak and other perks enabled I can decide if I want to mele at 2000 damage or long shot an enemy with vats for 500 damage. Either way they go down. It's fun to experiment with perks, builds and weapons. That's what's amazing about this game. 
---
Yea i think ill change out ironclad and junkshield.
---
At the moment im late to the game and have only started a week ago, and ive left about 10 skill points untouched trying to sort out a build before i spend them. Some mats are kind of hard to get ahold of so im mainly going for a high dmg but sneaky build (glass cannon), mixing rifles with melee as i feel im switching to melee alot just to stack up on ammo again and I see higher LVs doing the same. 
---
I wont be running power armor for a while if at all too be honest. Thanks for the replies, ive been changing things here and there and hopefully ill come out with one a bit better.
---
I think it would be be worth it to do an update to throwables, especially there only 2 items. If they added more I could see them adding new perks as well but who knows.
---
Enjoy being shot down :)
---
In all honesty though it would be cool if you could hop into a bird FO4 style and get a ride over Appalachia to wherever. Maybe if they could figure out a way to pay for a negligable amount resources so you could save caps on fast travel at the expense of the extra time it would be to take flight. 
---
Damn Cliff Racers. 
---
It‚Äôs the Giant mask. Your inventory mod is using the original ID and not the new one. According to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3ghvv/dataminer_here_list_of_all_fasnacht_rewards_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) 
---
Oohhh 
---
Literally never watched an episode xD 
---
If what you're shooting at isn't at full health, Instigating is just a regular LE. Bloodied is consistantly higher dmg with every shot.
---
I've seen the Goblin mask. It stands out because I thought it sucked.
---
Why not? There are photos of people with the backpacks that arent in the game yet.
---
Bloodied, hands down if you're already running a bloodied build.
---
Is there any violet flux there. Curious minds wanna know. 
---
It really doesn't seem to. I've done 80% of the event, and like 5% of the event and I seem to get the same random mix of stuff. 
---
I lock one door. It's an inner door, usually worthless. It's for the curious. 
---
I've never not had all the robots survive. I wonder what you get when some die. 
---
Im level 15 and done the quest like 5 times, its really fun and ive got a couple of (bad) legendaries for when im level 35 lol
---
Ahh, that makes sense.
---
Anyone who got into the dev room was banned untill anything that needed to be removed was basically, no one who was unbanned recently would have the mask either, only know of one instance of a person keeping items after unban and he had no rare items.
---
The far south train station near the disposal site spawns coffee in the bathroom on the sink. 
---
Yeah that's my go-to. Is this for the white Russian?
---
Same. I got it to only start twice and I've never been able to get it a third time
---
Yeah I think a locked door encourages more players to destroy ya stuff 
---
i  personally  love The Pack Wack the Sharp modification will Halt the Gulper's  regeneration  and it is VERY STRONK
---
Yes :3
---
Same happened to my nephew today. Just vanished 
---
Even though you haven't seen the show, you might still get a kick out of the clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS0lRyEBRnk
---
I really, really hope so. 
---
its only been what, a day? could it be that the other masks won't be dropped until later in the week? 
---
So ive changed it to this now,

I left blocker out as i rarely get hit as it is atm, and i feel like adamuntium and leaving 2 in ironclad, or should i get rid of ironclad all together for 2 in blocker?
---
Don‚Äôt forget the post-parade tradition of sharing spoiled food and .38 rounds with one another.
---
awe snaps gonna start collecting those reward drops for the player vending then. 
---
It's a neat concept but it has too many problems, before they patched it out and added push to talk, I mainly encountered people doing the following...
---
Chewing loudly into the mic
---
Drinking loudly into the mic
---
Coughing up lungs into the mic
---
Breathing heavily
---
Making weird moaning sounds
---
People screaming in the background
---
Dogs barking in the background
---
World's loudest keyboard
---
People talking on Discord loudly to others
---
I think cues could be taken from ESO player hubs like Daggerfall fountain. What they all had in common was a high concentration of vendors. 
---
You‚Äôd think something similar would occur in the mall at Whitesprings, but the lag in that area is AIDS, plus the elevator music just makes me want to en hero after a few minutes, so no one will stick around. Plus it‚Äôs not a large, open area.
---
No thank you
---
Mr meeseeks can you help bethesda let us access our pipboy while sleeping?
---
I only got it once. I can pretty consistantly get the one to set up targets in the toxic valley... And the one with the air and earth samples but those are the only two that really proc for me.
---
I just told you lmao, I have solo‚Äôed the queen with my bloodied unyielding low hp build, in less than 10 minutes.
---
Pretty much, yeah, 2 shot, fires 2 shots for the price of one
---
Wow.
---
I had this exact same thing happen to me. I stashed all but one td and I thought this was how the game handled it. That it took 1 from your stash automatically. I've turned in hundreds yet I don't even remember the last time I picked up a technical data.
---
It would be pretty silly to be banned for this, it's not our fault the game dumps technical data in our pocket and tells us  to turn it in lol.
---
I can finally be a headless horseman!
---
And maybe visit one of the Appalachia player camp brothels and be a headless Whore's man
---
Roses are red, violets are blue. You're too overencumbered to move. 
---
They patch one, then a new one (or more) is found. Will it ever truly end?
---
Agree.
---
"Dupers" can use friends to join back the server anyway, plus to them it's irrelevant.
---
Better nuke it from orbit, it's the only way to be sure. 
---
you can only get them when you lvl up or from cardpacks, it doesnt matter if you are max lvl everytime you lvl up you pick a skill point or a card after lvl 50, before lvl 50 perk cards can only be unlock at a given lvl. 
---
with that I think I have only gotten cards that i want from card pack 1 or 2 times, better off picking the ones you what once you lvl up.
---
yeah for pvp adrenaline would be pritty much useless unless you kill something before you fight and you have what 30 secs to pvp before the boost goes away. 
---
Keep it. Someone probably finished bos quest and was rewarded the ultrasite power armor set so they can now craft ultrasite armor too. They probably had no stash room and dropped it for someone else to enjoy using it. Have fun
---
Yup I just take all three power stations and go on my business, come back and loot 15 cores. 
---
Agreed. I actually have friends now. 
---
It‚Äôs the most ridiculous, awesome event ever.
---
Are you the new rude bot? 
---
It's a seasonal version of the event where you escort the protectron through the jail, but with less enemies. It's not a mind blowingly amazing event in any way.
---
For what it's worth, [this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6f455e7&amp;d=ar2an2a51ao0lt2ic4ej3pp2pd2pk2pl2c72sb2sg1l71cu0a03pr2lu1ae0s60&amp;w=&amp;n=) is the build I use when I want to be quiet and [this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6f455e7&amp;d=lt2ic4ej3pp2sb2l71am2a03a71a41c72sg1cu0pd2pk2pl2lu1pr2au2s60&amp;w=&amp;n=) is the one I use when I want to be loud. No power armor, with the marsupial/carnivore/bird bones/scaly skin mutations its pretty nice and modular. Priority is two armor pieces with 50% fall damage reduction so no more falling to your death, then chameleon and finally weapon and ammo weight reduction armors with some Vanguard scattered here and there.
---
Both builds are set up to be modular, I only need to swap perk cards out of the agility tree. But if I so choose, I can trade all my Rifleman cards for Commando cards and rock fully auto weapons, and changing LVL 3 Long Shot to LVL 3 Ground Pounder makes it a rusher/striker build. 
---
Oh so it will only cost 1 of my grenades?
---
The game has improved with regards to stability and balance but listen: if you've already let someone else make your mind up for you then you could be missing out. There was (is) a Eurogamer review which seems to have been written by someone whose dog died AND whose wife left him all on the same day. At first I agreed with it but swiftly changed my mind and have since got 500 hours of fun from it.
---
Game reviewers are just people, they have no special insight. They may even be more jaded as they HAVE to play games.
---
Watch some gameplay videos. The general consensus of opinion amongst those of us who persevered is that the game is great.
---
White springs isnt what it used to be. Been there several times since the last update and the glowing ghouls don't respawn when new people arrive like they used to. Several times I show up and absolutely nothing. That place has definitely been nerfed. As for the Queen, she is easier to take out now but the drops are mediocre. Still fun but can be a let down. 
---
what missions????
---
Should be a priority feature.
---
I might only be able to do this once because of my schedule, but I'm glad I got this mask.
---
I have no idea what I got because I dropped it all at the event. I have no use for any of it. 
---
I will be uploading a complete guide with pictures and how to get the items within the week. 
---
Rebuilding Appalachia, one house at a time! :)
---
Normally I love the T-51b the most aesthetically, but the red shoulders on T-60 take the cake here üòÆ
---
Are they just daily missions? Or can you do more than 1 a day for Biv?
---
Sorry for the late reply. Just now saw this. No, it's not listed in my list of apps to enable it either. I just had to enable the overall setting for apps to access the microphone.
---
If it was working and then stopped, it sounds as though there were likely some update on your system that may have caused it to stop functioning. I wouldn't know what that would be, however. If it were happening to me, first thing I would do is check to see if this were the case. Check Windows updates and also see if any drivers were updated. Something may have gone south with one of them.
---
Get married. /s
---
Heavy weapons are overkill in fasnacht event. I will bet you drank hefe too
---
Reviewed by whom? Special beings with vastly superior intellects or just other people?
---
No. Having done the new event, I've had to mute two people with open mics so far. One person who had his mic down his lungs, apparently, and the other who had his mic right in front of his television speaker at max volume. I don't want to hear that sort of thing. I would think no one would. At least there is an option to mute people.
---
Ohhhhh. he's trying.
---
Where is this body? Because I‚Äôve never seen a body with BoS combat armor in that mine. Can you be more specific to where it is?
---
Generally confronting a person about their open mic will only make them get defensive about it about and obnoxious. It's significantly easier just to mute them instead of bothering talking to them about it, even politely.
---
On top of poseidoin powerplant is trailer with lvl1 hazmat suit. That will suit you in nuke zone, no matters what level you are.
---
Try to convince me youre not posting from in bed right now.
---
I don't know what time zone you're in. But if you ever want to play with folks, add me. We all play with mics, so that would be easiest. We're pretty casual, though have some who drop in who aren't as casual, but still cool. At a minimum, hit me up and we can see if you want any of the armor or weapons I have available in my stash. I think I still have a few interesting pieces for your level.
---
PSN - chakra_bender 
---
I forgot what people were calling it but it‚Äôs the parade event one and the robot is wearing it. Skull looking with a good of sorts. So far no ones had it dropped yet 
---
i didnt think anyone on xbox had gotten into the dev room?
---
Yes let me find it. They posted a picture of the person they saw wearing it. 
---
What purpose would I have in crafting so much excess ammo?  It's not like I can sell it and it takes up inventory space.  What am I crafting all this extra ammo for if all I do is continue farming materials to craft more ammo?
---
I get that its technically possible to farm the materials needed just like its technically possible all those 100k nuka cola people could have spent all their time every day since launch collecting nuka and doing nothing else.   Similar to the nuka people it would be real easy to tell if your account does literally nothing but farm the specific item you were banned for, so easy it probably wouldn't get you banned in the first place ü§î
---
I get ‚Äúserver not responding controls temporarily disabled‚Äù a lot soo there‚Äôs that 
---
sounds like you need a harder hitting weapon.
---
what's the build your trying to run?
---
If you're on pc, I've got some gear I could help out with.
---
Totally agree with your comments, but the game mechanics doesn't really fit into a standard PvP environment. Understandably in real life, if attacked by a large knife or gun then you'd be seriously injured or killed but most games avoid this realistic consequence. Instead a player usually have equipment or options to protect themselves against being immediately dispatched or killed. What I'm saying is that if a player and location is heavily defended (like It was), it is stupid that a player can be immediately killed without able to retaliate or protect themselves.(Unless sniped:) ) . There is no local map or compass system (and you can't keep pressing M Key) so impossible to track an enemy.
---
Concerning 'intended' mechanics. Theoretically and practically yes. When the Workshop were initially designed, Bethesda believed that the game (and server) would be more popular, so that a map's resources would be depleted that players would team up and fight to own the limited components. Instead the majority of new players are now solo characters as in the normal offline Fallout universe. So when a player like myself attempt to obtain an Unclaimed workshop normally they don't expect to be challenged by a team especially with resources being abundant. 
---
Concerning the 'Griefing', this was written when angry and frustrated but understandably when a single high level player can be easily dispatched and taken out by an organised team or co-operative players this leaves a bitter taste. Why bother spending time getting the best equipment when a player can be immediately killed.    
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 I can help you so you can at least get that quest finished. I‚Äôll give you a couple keycards as well if you‚Äôd like
---
This is a design flaw. You get nice people willing to let others tag mobs, then suddenly a person comes in who doesn't care or is just a bastard. Then the nice person says "OK this isn't paying off for me" pulls out their weapon next time. 
---
I've done at least 30 and haven't seen anybody wearing any of the "rare" ones. i'm going to say they're either bugged or perhaps it's a staggered drop table and we won't see the others till later in the event. 
---
not the halloween mask one, it's a skull face wearing a sort of pointy hood with a skull on that. the joyous musician wears it while marching in the parade.
---
I like it. I really wish the "Kill, Laugh, Love" thing was "Live, Laugh, Kill", though. 
---
Wanting to move your camera when playing a instrument is understandable. The same goes for opening pip boy when seated. The moment you sit down you are locked out of any interaction even emotes. I should be able to eat, drink, emote, turn cam when seated. Why build desks or seats otherwise.
---
Fuck I really want to get this game now
---
Have to say it doesn't take much to kill these enemies. In my level 45 with a lever rifle of the same rank, vanilla not legendary or even hardened I was taking out suiciders. 
---
Then they wouldn't click on a fucking data mining thread then would they?  Someone clicking on a thread titled data mining and then getting pissed off at seeing all the data mined information gets what they have coming. You're that special kind of stupid aren't you. 
---
Wrong
---
I had the impression the only thing pacifist do was preventing accidental pvp from the person using it. But what do i know.
---
PvP is definitely broken. They are supposed bro be fixing it though.
---
I tend to hang around in Watoga and when they spawn there you can get up onto the buildings to avoid the word of the damage drop-off and the robots keep the vertibots entertained for you.
---
But yeah, they're a royal pain in the arse to shoot down... 
---
You monster.
---
I hope they dont fix it. I like it 
---
If you are on Xbox let me know, I‚Äôll help you out.
---
IF that was on PC and you don't want it...
---
[Nope.](https://i.imgur.com/66TleXB.png)
---
Oof
---
Problem was fixed
---
Adamantium Skeleton doesn't actually reduce damage received though. It only prevents limb crippling. For defense I like serendipity(luck) because it scales well as it's a percentage and not a flat DR value.
---

I wish we got like a little radio type object for our camps, the music would fit my chem store well!
---
I never lose addictions when joining new servers so I guess it just depends. You really have to spam something to become addicted, the challenge yesterday where you had to drink 50 alcoholic beverages definitely got me addicted by the 15th
---
Yeah so do i, shouldn't be hard to add that in, Bethesda 
---
Unfortunately the 2 shot grenade launcher does the same dammage as a non-legendary.  I got one a few days ago and another one tonight and both do 138 dammage and that's the same dammage my non-legendary does.  So unless the listed dammage is different from what it actually deals, then it's so something that needs to be fixed.
---
Yea I want to be able to sit on my couch in game and play with the computer on my arm. Manage my inventory, you know that kind of thing would be nice. 
---
Adamantium is not as good as it seems. You still take damage from limb hits, it just doesn't deplete that limbs health bar.
---
Upvote this nephew.
---
We agreed to meet up again and do a server quest. It was so nice to interact and see the diversity of the players. Great event! 
---
On the right hand side after the fissure near the wall you will see two dead fog crawlers and the body of the bos woman right next to the transponder.
---
Totally true, but the only other option would be X1 Armor, Reflective Armor pieces and Chems! Unfortunately my power armor wasn't equipped with the auto-stim mod and didn't have chance to use the damage resist chem or X-cell!. In truth didn't expect to dispatched with an automatic 800+ HP single hit! 
---
I was going to do it tonight and no one was there. I logged off since I reckon I am too low level to do it solo. Was disappoint. 
---
It's funny watching ppl with their explosive weapons trying to light it up.... maybe they should make it so you can shoot it on fire 
---
Why play games in the first place? To pass time with something you enjoy. I like to just zone out and go collecting, like other people like to go out an farm nuke zones. Its just a personal preference of playstyle.
---
As for it being that easy to stop bans like that from happening, there has been speculation and what looks like proof of their system false flagging accounts that where only swapping ammo yet triggering the auto ban? Just to further this point, take a look at their bug fixing history. They have "patched" multiple bugs only to have them return or not be fixed in the first place.
---
Pan gofukyurslf326 I have roughly 100+ send me a dm or a message on ps4
---
Just gotta hit hard enough to kill in a shot or two.
---
don't give em time to stim.
---
But you're not wrong. It needs work.
---
Seems to me somebody has a very rude attitude and needs to really put that situation into a box and adjust that. Nobody doesn't have time for that.
---
I completely agree although my base isn‚Äôt tiny but it doesn‚Äôt take up much space
---
I got 2 giants, 2 witches, 1 toothman, 1 soldier and finally 1 owl. But you shouldn't have to serverhop if you want all.
---
Any cloak or chameleon effect can trigger this and you can reset it by again triggering the same effect. I have a cloaking piece of armor that occasionally bugs out like so I keep a chameleon piece on hand to swap in and reset it. 
---
Ive done three times the event, got the soldier mask every time. A bit salty. :3
---
I did not know about that, you probably know more than I do.
---
I‚Äôm well aware it does nothing but just enjoy hitting it with a TSE when he starts the chant and everyone joins in. It‚Äôs just for fun. 
---
I‚Äôve done the event and completed it twice, but I want to find the other variations.
---
Now that the problem has been fixed (and this is the proof the issue was real and didn't involve only me), I wanna thank Bethesda technical support but also all users of reddit community who offered suggestions, experience or just solidarity.
---
Want to spend also just two words (they do not deserve more) for all users who, without any reason, attaked another user (me), sometimes in a very rude way, that was just reporting a real issue that affected hundred of other players and which solustion was a benefit for the whole community. You are poor, poor insane people. 
---
Nuke Comic Sans, nuke it straight to hell &amp; take papyrus with it for good measure. 
---
I buy 50 ultracite ammo from people because I‚Äôm too lazy to farm it, just figured I‚Äôd give my 2 cents cause I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more players like me out there who enjoy trading and being a part of RP community‚Äôs where each person has specific tasks. As for the nuka colas, nah that‚Äôs definitely duped.
---
I saw someone with that today (pc)
---
Watoga highschool, monster mash event.  
---
How many hours do you play a week would you say? Just curious 
---
Yes, but utilizes the verticalized minimalism aesthetic. I‚Äôve been making bases in Minecraft and 76 this way
---
I just wish it scaled a little bit more to make it a little bit more difficult. But I get what they were going for. And get they want to try to get even people coming out of the Vault to be able to at least attempt it.
---
With that being said, I actually enjoyed it. It was cool seeing the whole server at this event.
---
thats the most random reason i heard
---
You‚Äôre telling me üòÇ
---
Based on the lack of feedback (aside from the "look at this video" comment, I'm assuming it's the former and (hopefully) we'll see a hotfix in a day or two.
---
I just can‚Äôt wait till they implement the changes to pacifist so that I don‚Äôt get ganked by some scrub with a bloodied build who decided that going out of their way to ruin other people‚Äôs fun sounds like a good idea
---
You get it. 
---
I watched folks shoot at it for a bit, then I walked up and lit it...
---
--close
---
Velveeta? 
---
Same here. I'm hoping we can get less border spacing enforcement at some point so we can build little towns with our friends. It might be too much for the servers to handle though. 
---
At level 118 I had a nice balance of legendary armour to play with. For fun I thought I would remove it for a while to balance the game. When I went to put it back on I realised I had dropped it not removed it. I had already server jumped and lost the lot. 
---
Ok I‚Äôll give you the unusual aspect of having that much ammo, but shouldn‚Äôt they be able to tell if it‚Äôs duped? And also to not respond to the OP for 4 weeks for a game they paid $60 for, even if it‚Äôs just to say you‚Äôre perma-banned, seems a little ridiculous to me. I hate dupers just as much as anyone else but I don‚Äôt understand how people can defend that terrible customer service. 
---
My current setup is 2x3 foundation with 2 on one side housing my fusion generator and fermenter. And the L left over contains my tinkers, camp, fireplace, brewing, cooking stove, chem, main stash, and a sofa. Upstairs which is 2x2 but only 1x2 due to stairs has weapon, armour, PA frame, bed, and foot locker. 
---
It‚Äôs ok but it feels like a small house and not tiny. 
---
Same. I kinda want to keep the trend going but it‚Äôs seem way more harder in 76. 
---
Oh okay compared to yours mines big it‚Äôs like a 3x4 single floor with roof garden I basically made a studio apartment 
---
Agree 100% First time I did the parade I was floored by how many of us there were and better yet, we were all cooperating and playing nice. Never had a video game experience quite like that.
---
Cheers might take advantage of this while it's around wouldn't mind a few hundred acid 
---
I‚Äôd take a picture of my place but I have no idea how to pull pics off of Xbox. Maybe just use my phone and share that. 
---
Ok so beam focuser is the culprit.. I start with that then :) Yea it's a bug 
---
I noticed all the robots are wearing rare masks. If one dies, is that the mask we stand a chance to get?
---
Ladynoodles.......as a high level player (Level 182 AvgGuy42 on PS4) an launched numerous nukes, I will respect opinion on the matter, I promised never to launch a nuke while the Fasnacht parade is going...........üëåüëç
---
I've randomly lost a base excavator helmet and a X-01 Calibrated leg...
---
Still man. They cant just scam our money like that. Unban us, wait for us to buy atoms for those new items. Then ban us right after
---
I hate to be that guy but we are trying to grind this as well, and the drops are determined by the overall performance. If you can‚Äôt run with the big dogs stay on the porch. 
---
I have done the event 50 times and a friend who is not playing let me use his account as well, so logged in with  both. That is 100 chances and no rares.
---
You could at least spell it correctly. 
---
There were people looking for quad gamma guns in the trading channels, so I'd guess that's a thing. I haven't even checked what the clip size is, so I wouldn't know why.
---
Let that salt flow bud, bloodied meta builds have ways to counter, this post is about role players and how people seem to have forgotten this is a post nuclear role playing game. If you just want to sit on a mountain of teddy bears, that's fine and dandy, i want to survive in a post nuclear wasteland. 
---
I know it‚Äôs pretty fucked up in that regard
---
The red shoulders one isn't Blackbird. It's West Virginia which you also can't get anymore.
---
Drops depend on how many robots survive. Just let them tag the sloth.
---
That's the default colour when you craft it.
---
I survive fine, just not a fan of someone coming up behind me and one shotting me when I‚Äôm not paying attention.  Just because it‚Äôs the apocalypse, doesn‚Äôt mean you have to throw away morality or honor
---
I love shooting squirrels because they don't shoot back. And these weird super saiyan 3 star robots that glow radiation, they can shoot a little, but then, they can also drop a nice 3 star weapon.
---
PvP is so horribly broken because of gears and perks.
---
It worked for me when I removed my chameleon armor Union will meet up there
---
I soaked some cloth pieces with the stuff
---
I call the final product "fuck tape" 
---
I saw it
---
I would love to get It put on my t60.
---
GT: S042 Douglas RT
---
The only Suicider I let live is the one making a beeline to that singing protectron.
---
Hell add the games to consoles and give us them free like they did for PC master race
---
Oh on that i agree. Unless they jack difficulty through the roof to make bloodied inviable then survival will be a bunch of perma-sneak assassins playing battle royale 76. The poorly explained pvp mechanics make for some confusing pvp interactions, but that doesn't invalidate the original point, role players have reasons for what they do. 
---
A good comparison, I'm a raider, but i know that telling people that in game would get me shot, ergo unless stalking a mark, I'm the friendly neighborhood raider in the vein of Jericho, or Porter Gage. It's a hard life, but a realistic one. 
---
Specific to nuking Helvetia tho, makes perfect sense 
---
That's kinda funny. I just shoot at it in the spirit of the event. Someone brought a flare gun to the last one I was at and it was great. 
---
Everyone should have push to talk
---
Shame on you if you don't 
---
Everyone should have a mic 
---
They are 5 bucks at a wall mart
---
If you are socially awkward I get it, but don't follow me or ask to trade or team up
---
No mic, no team play
---
Have you noticed that sometimes the Sloth loot is shared by everyone looting, not separate. First one in gets the Legendary and that is why sometime it seems like it is not dropping loot, even though you are sure you tagged it.
---
It seems and this is hypothetical, that there is also a few moments after spawn where the Sloth has not turned into a Legendary mob jet, people kill him before the game can update the mob?
---
Shame I am gonna miss this event as I am working through out all 7 days when its available.
---
I did this earlier with 2 owl heads. I was like wtf
---
My sloth just glitches 90% of the time and freezes and becomes unlootable. 
---
It's RP to do being a Raider, it's also RP to hate Raiders. Sooo, if people hate you, don't bitch and cry, we're just RPing decent people. This is a Fallout game, Fallout games have decent people trying hard to get rid of Raiders. Don't get your feelings hurt when we're just RPing bro. Need a tissue and a safe space? 
---
Tbh your best strat is to not let him hit you good melee builds pretty much one shot everyone
---
See, that makes perfect sense in the way of playing a character.  Gage would take from whoever he could get while in his territory
---
Still need it on PC? How much?
---
Hmm I don't have any chameleon armor equipped, so I'm guessing it probably has to do with mutation? Idk so I'll try. Thanks for the input
---
Ahhh! I have the same objective but with beer, and it won‚Äôt complete, AND I have chameleon piece of armour. I‚Äôll try it!
---
Quantum mechanics forbid this 
---
I very much enjoy seeing people shoot it, and throw puny molotovs at it, and then stand in awe as I throw an orbital strike beacon and watch it get blasted from orbit.
---
That's my favorite part, even though i die if i don't run away fast enough.
---
Same here, I'll help the OP if they're on xbox. 
---
Would running the event in full unyielding armor with +3 to all specials affect the reward in any way does anyone know??
---
I regularly bring those down near Watoga just for the fun of it. I don't even use the keycards. 
---
Regeneration on that thing sounds like a bug, i never had that happen before. I use a regular lvl 50 lever action rifle and shoot down the turbines within 6 shots or so for each one, without vats. After that its a sitting duck and goes down fast.
---
I dont know why you had such trouble with it but i guess you dont have any perks that boost the range of your weapons and use stuff like silencers which reduce range. Thats the problem with the thing, the distance of it being in the sky reduces the dmg it takes. Just remove silencers on your stuff and use the perk that increases weapon range when aiming and you have no issues at all.
---
3 Brahmin? I thought you could only have one. That'd be ok actually, if I were somewhere I had that much dirt. Maybe next CAMP will be a nice farm somewhere. 
---
Bethesda seriously underestimated the souls of 76ers when they denied us the ability to shoot it on fire. 
---
Motto: if in doubt, shoot it. 
---
:::nods::: 
---
I often see them inside buildings, too. 
---
Oh how I miss running to every iron mine and every merchant in whiterun and solitude buying up all their iron ingots/ore. And then proceed to craft a hundred daggers, to which I just sell and get a little money back.
---
Eventually I became a jeweler
---
More lucrative. and more rewarding xp wise. Plus I get to keep the cool ones I make to enchant. Made me a wealthy elf.
---
Yeah, of all things they need to fix, Dailies are a huge one. 
---
You were in the area and you didn't get credit?
---
It didn't take raiders nuking the place to make me give up on the event.   I  ran it three times, and got the same plans 2 out of those three times. 
---
It hit me immediately: the Fasnacht parade is a pagan ritual where gamers pay tribute to the RNG gods in the hopes of getting better loot. 
---
Uh... no. 
---
Just no. 
---
Nobody should play favorites.
---
You can play them on a potato... Just download on your pc and play
---
Most of the trading subreddits are focused in end game stuff so it's pretty hard to sell mid-tier stuff, even for cheap. I would hang on to it for the legendary vendor or sell it to a friend. Or even a vendor bot?
---
When I first log in I cannot fast travel to my camp, in my case it takes a couple of minutes for it to work, but you can fast travel to other locations near it. I guess you have to wait for the game to build your camp, the bigger the camp the slower it takes.
---
It's not raiders that asking for the safe space bud.  It's the hoarders that want pve only servers. Nice projection though. 
---
Uranium Fever only has Mole Miners and they max at 40, though, right? 
---
Goddamnit, wasnt beam focuser either for me. Changed from beam focuser to standard. The red laser flash impacts just turned green.. No plasma flying.. 
---
You can do this even if you don't have high level friends. Just go there, toss a bullet in everything you see, then get where nothing can kill you and people will kill everything for you. 
---
 Goddamnit, wasnt beam focuser either for me. Changed from beam focuser to standard. The red laser flash impacts just turned green.. No plasma flying.. 
---
Try the raider vendors or raider locations in the savage divide. The place where the quest 'One violent night' might have some lying around. 
---
I'm realizing that's literally what you said, I'm tired lol sorry. 
---
*screams in wanting new DLC sooner*
---
Yeah, probably gonna be a bit ‚Äúdull‚Äù, but I hope the sheepsquatch also brings people together!
---
Why not heavy weapons? Already rocking batteries included, get some gatling plasmas and such going! With maxed bear arms they weigh less than pistols. Only other tip I can think of is about thinks like heavy gunner.. I prefer to keep all 3 variants at level 1, or to have a maxed version and also a one star version. This makes it better for you point wise... 1 card at lvl 1 gives + 10%, but if you lvl it, it only goes up +5%. Equipping the other cards at lvl 1 will get you an extra 10% watch vs the 5 % boost per level per card.
---
Oh man, why didn't I think to mix stuff... Awesome job on the result! üôÇ
---
Highly skilled; well done :0)
---
Can confirm the one on the road south of point pleasant. It was in the middle of the road parallel to the hunter's ridge place.   
---
The only one that spawned to me, tho. Not even the overseer cache one did after about 3 hours of hopping lol. 
---
I keep seeing Raiders being like "I'm just RPing y r u upset lol get over it it's fallout (really bad words about women, gay people and minorities here)", well the exact same thing can be said to Raiders. It's Fallout, we're trying to rebuild and you're being Raiders, we're not going to like each other. Either stop bitching about people not liking Raiders, or don't be a Raider. 
---
Haha highly patient perhaps, skilled would mean I didnt fall off my own roof as often as I did.. but Thank you! *lol*
---
And I would love PvE servers, I fully admit. But I'm not pretending to be 100% RP in a Fallout game. If every single one of you Raiders was really 100% RP, you'd be doing things differently, but every single one of you I see in game is the exact same. High level picking on low level, with crazy gear half the time obviously bought from a duper. That's not RP, that's ego about forcing everyone to play how you want and then crying on Reddit about how no one likes your play style. 
---
Sunday Brothers farm, downstairs in the locked room.
---
If you get all the holotapes required the quest "completes" but is never marked as completed. The quest will stay active and the holotapes marked a quest items and stay in your inventory undroppable until Bethesda patches it. You can turn off the quest though. I've never seen a video or screenshot of anyone showing the holotapes no longer marked as quest items. If that exists, please post it here.
---
There is a SINGLE strangler bloom outside of the graveyard at Point Pleasant. 
---
Hehe, I guess they are able to release the egendary vendor...
---
...selling 3 \* items...
---
...for which you can't check the stats !
---
I don't know if people actually do it because they think it will set it on fire I think people are just messing around, I know for me its more entertaining to Molotov it right as someone lights it just to see it flame up or the occasional mini nuke.
---
Has anyone be able to build upon that highest mountain?
---
Note that dieing to an NPC doesn't fix this.
---
I encountered OP's problem and tried dieing to a turd NPC and it didn't work.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been noticing more events to do while waiting for the parade. I‚Äôve been doing some I usual don‚Äôt do or never have done 
---
It doesn't make the robots go any faster to madly shoot into the air during the first leg of the parade, but that doesn't stop me either!
---
This is perfect, I happen to be role playing as a raider!
---
What do you have against Sans and Papyrus? They‚Äôre both cool pair of skeletons. 
---
 Nah, that's just being a flat dick. I've got rules for myself; but others may not. 
---
My "raiding gear" is chameleon or weightless pieces i farmed myself, and junkies weapons for role play. I choose not to go after level 50 with the mindset "they're not even a full person yet, let them grow up" the ones that teleport with a bloodied dcg still get bored in a few weeks when the division 2 comes out
---
I am in pc if you want to help you :)
---
name: Crazymalkavian. I am playing from Europe though  GMT+2. I dont know if that is convenient for you. 
---
Thats the reason why when I do Uranium event I usualy invite to a team whoever is doing that as well so drop and kill can be shared.
---
The real question is: why haven‚Äôt you done it?
---
Fair enough, I probably won't wear any besides a rare one if I get one or the owl one ...if I get it. Good job on the mods man, they look really nice!
---
I mean, it seems hard to believe that out of 25 events I've run and the hundreds of people I've seen and my buddies have seen, and everyone here on reddit have seen that only a single guy saw a guy with one of the 5 rare masks. It's HALF of the masks and they're just THAT rare?? This is like old school Everquest 1 levels of rare. 
---
I'm betting they made a decimal error and the chances are something like winning the lottery OR the error is that they're not dropping at all.
---
Sign out and then sign in again, you should be able to complete the quests then
---
I can almost hear Bethesda replying:  We're sorry, we'll have our Devs look into it in about 4-6 weeks!  Yeah, then what's the point?
---
Ever get the feeling Bethesda's doing all of this stuff intentionally?  You know, to troll all of us? 
---
It sure seems like it!  Nobody's that incompetent!
---
I completely agree. This shits harder than finding an exotic in destiny. I'd be more fine with it (but not much more) if the event was permanent but since it's only a week I feel like a lot of players (maybe all) won't ever get one of them.
---
I know what you mean lol.
---
Only reason I wasn't going to go with heavy, was because I have a pretty decent 3* ultracite laser rifle, but it's definitely in consideration!
---
Vey true üëç
---
I eated muh potato 
---
Same
---
Would having very high Charisma flip the loot drops?
---
Did you scroll all the way down to this post from like 2 days ago just to write that?
---
I was having a blast slow walking in a goofy parade with others doing the same! 
---
Instead of following the one you're directed too and spending caps traveling around, try throwing a US Government Requisition Holotape in a Relay Tower Terminal and shoot down whatever Cargobot shows up for the Supply Drop before it begins the landing process.
---
You won't have to chase it, you'll know exactly where it's going so you can lay in wait instead üëç
---
The Relay south of WS tends to summon one to somewhere on the golf course, nicely out in the open and relatively predictable. Just load a tape, shoot down the Cargobot, then rinse and repeat if there was no card or you need extras (**highly recommend** bringing more than one when doing a Silo, in case you make a mistake on the launch code keypad)
---
I'd like a costume from all the older games. Fallout 1 Combat Armor, Fallout 2 X-01 "Advanced Power Armor", NCR Ranger Veteran long coat. 
---
Does it fit with the lore? Probably not, but if it's just cosmetic stuff then why not? Take my money Bethesda. 
---
Thanks for the great tips will help me with my level 25 and 40 characters on Xbox, I‚Äôm upgrading the PC so might as well get Fallout 76 for it also!
---
I used to collect different outfits just in case, but after first 300 hours I realized I never put any of those on -)) Now I don't even bother to try to find any. Hope they'll add something worthwile to the atomic store in the nearest future.
---
Thank you for the kind words!
---
just leave the world or game?
---
Level 117 and haven‚Äôt touched the game since launch. Complete bullshit. And the new event is stupid, with no reward.
---
I didn't bring him into the conversation. Someone asked me why I couldn't switch my sp to englush and I just answered. Are you able to read? 
---
Wait, there is excavator power armor paint job?? Where!!
---
I left the game entirely, then it worked when I started again.
---
&gt; duplicate

FBI OPEN UP!

Man alive. My current CAMP is one which I built before the big build limit increase, and honestly, all it is is the same small house that it was when that was all that was possible, but with a couple of extra rooms stuck onto the sides (and more turrets outside). Seeing this, seeing the grandeur that's possible, it's clear that I need to tear down the whole thing and start again, planning something of a grander scale from the outset. Gotta dream big if I want a palace like this! 
---
Oh heck, is that why my budget is gone? Goodbye brahman
---
All shops use big shiny "SALE" to lure costumers in, are they all wrong too?

I don‚Äôt think I can take pillows anymore now I know they have Scorched drool on them!

"I have also a child too young for speaking english, why should I waste al his games for Bethesda mistakes?"  
---
This is your sentence. This is your child you are posting about.
---
Thus *you* posted about *your* child in an online forum and expect no one to talk about *your* child?  
---
Are you not able to comprehend this at all????
---
They are in game, that much we know from dataminers. I have a theory about it even if it‚Äôs dumb...has anyone read all/found all the event notes?
---
I‚Äôm wondering if you have to locate them via unmarked quest or by meeting a unknown criteria you get it as a bonus on quest completion?
---
Why would unyielding armor effect the drops?
---
As I told you it was the answer regarding why I couldn't switch my ps in english. Is not so difficult to understand, just try, maby you can.... 
---
Has there been enough thorough testing to know if nuking the event is pointless or worth the effort to nuke? I can‚Äôt find any info from anyone who has tested this more than once. 
---
I may be way off and it may just be a low drop rate like other event apparel awards, but it seems wiser to test the mechanics as many way as possible, as much as possible before the week completes. 
---
5 masks drop regularly, while the other 5 seem basically non-existent. Sure, some say they‚Äôve seen someone with a Sun mask, but no image proof of this yet. As for the Death, Demon, Merman &amp; Old Man Winter I‚Äôve seen zero players with these items nor anyone stating they have one or have seen another player wearing any of them. It‚Äôs been 2 heavy days (two 8-10 hour sessions) of doing nothing at all but server hops for the event and in that time not one person revealed to have one of the 5 rare masks.
---
Would love some insight here.
---
They're also a very rare drop from lunch pails.
---
Woo you go man! 
---
Honestly I just wanted to see exactly how far I could push and how rediculous I could go *lol* 
---
Highly recommend it- it was fun to see what I could come up with without the previous limits. 
---
If youre happy with what you have though and it works for you, just look at the 4-5 things you could change and turn up the volume :D Would love to see what you come up with!
---
Yea, that sh#t doesn't scale at all. I have seen the difficulty of 10 players in that event, still too easy.
---
It barley glimmers, the quest rewards are where it‚Äôs at. 
---
*Ban a guy that has played over 900 hours in 2 months and has 150k rounds of ammo*

Either you caught one of the most unambitious dupers in the game, or you just alienated one of your biggest fans...
---
Was helpful when I fell into that massive radiation pool in the power plant in my power armour and sank to the very bottom xD
---
Two words. Class freak.
---
I've gotten a couple from doing events, you can get region specific disease cures from doing events in those regions. I've also had other plans such as stimpaks, mentats and super stimpaks as rewards fro doing things like the BOS events and dailys in the cranberry bog region. 
---
Damn.. i just learned it. Was thinking of selling it but for curious. Sorry
---
Its you utter failure of comprehension that is blocking your ability to understand at all what you so obviously did regardless of your pitiful excuse of "switch my ps in english".
---
Another idea is adding a way for players to send server-wide messages that show up in the top of the screen. This could help players find others to create their own events
---
The drop list is bugged so it‚Äôs not currently possible to get the rare masks legit.
---
Unless they are obtainable via unmarked quest or meeting some unmarked criteria in the parade quest?
---
In the R and G train station toilet in the sink.
---
All op, all the time. Fuck the low level players. 5* kamikaze tse shotties. Woah ya!!!!
---
Isn't the ONLY reason to do hoard events for the legendary at the end?
---
You had the high ground... and then you traded it for an insult
---
Can confirm ending the event with 1 alive didn‚Äôt award anyone in our events any masks outside of the common 5. (sun was the sole survivor and no suns dropped). Done 41 parades now and most were 5 robot survivors, everyone received the common 5.
---
We will solve this before it‚Äôs too late!!!
---
Because it‚Äôs the DMV
---
Legendary vendor?
---
Is rather have the ability to "store" an entire camp in a specific location. That way you can mess around with trying a new area or just new build, but still have the option of popping your old camp back up instantly if you change your mind without having to rebuild the whole damned thing again.
---
Obviously this storage should not be unlimited. Maybe limited to 3 or 4 camp setups?
---
I like potatoes.
---
Exactly. And by their own admission via the email they sent me, I 100% got suspended for ammo. Who the fuck dupes ammo? I've never duped anything, but I sure as shit wanted to dupe nuka-cola grenades. I love Nuke Mines and have used them for months, so I figured out the best spots to farm materials for them. Duping 10,000 of them would've been way simpler.
---
But no, I chose to craft a lot of ammo and the method I used to trade it to my mule got me flagged. They accused me of having like 500k+ various ammos. I actually had about 80k.
---
What's the point in building a camp? Not trying to be a douche Im just wondering if theres any other mechanic to it except having a place to rest and drop of loot. Haven't played 76 but I did play F4 extensively.
---
Incoming responses from a bunch of excavator/pacifist mode vault boys 
---
I've been doing it naked, intoxicated on chems... As I'm only lvl 29 I hope the high number of paticipants keep being high for a while longer.
---
Joined a nuked Helvetia and completed the event. There were level 68 scorched and glowing enemies. Event works even with it being a nuke zone. 
---
Yeah given this weeks Dev Room penetration it‚Äôs rough to tell what‚Äôs legit and what‚Äôs stolen. With no video documentation showing an organic looting of the mask we just don‚Äôt know. 
---
Exactly the point of I wanted to make. If there was to be tradeoff, then it should also affect 3rd person mode.
---
Yep you are absolutely correct my friend. However I've experienced that instead of there being a Legendary Boss Enemy like there should be, there is a Crown Boss Enemy instead. Not a no-star Legendary like you find a lot of the time but a enemy variant with the crown icon before it's name at the top of the screen.
---
I‚Äôve gotten some of mine from the treasure maps 
---
Yes and explosive...
---
No seriously not sure if it was legit or not but some jackass rolled into my camp and was spamming it. Then I saw him doing absolutely no good at Whitesprings using it on ghouls.
---
Its all part of the design.   Works as intended!
---
But it's catchy. I want that playing in my camp!
---
Yeah since the last patch I‚Äôve had bout 5 of these events result in a boss enemy with the crown but not a legendary.  Can‚Äôt tell if this is an intentional nerf or just a bug. 
---
Also as a side note the robobrain horde has gotten stuck inside the wall at Robco 3/5 times I‚Äôve done it, hadn‚Äôt seen this before the last patch either. You can eventually kill it thru Vats but you‚Äôre not always able to loot it.
---
I tried using throwing knives with my new ninja build character. They worked very well at the beginning but I stopped using them at about lvl 20 because their damage fall off hard at that time. I did some research with no actual result though. It seems to me that there is no perk that increases the damage of throwables right now.
---
Found mine in the river outside of dyer chemical in the river on a tree in the morning on a Tuesday.
---
Check out the roadmap online, there‚Äôs not a lot of information on how it‚Äôll work but it‚Äôs slated to be introduced in May.
---
Maybe they could just add the third person dot when you aim
---
That may be the intention, but not how it works in practice. I just did a few runs while allowing some of the bots to get destroyed - absolutely no difference.
---
Just go to Bonnaroo or something.
---
I've locked the door to my generators but that's about it tbh 
---
Sure it does:
---
1) They take your number when you get to the clerk.  (number vanishes)
---
2)  They reject you because you do not have all the required documentation... in triplicate.  Along with your blood type, birth certificate, SSN, state ID, Vehicle plate number, digitized photo, thermal scan, retinal scan, ect ect ect.
---
3)  You drive home to get all that crap.
---
4)  You get another number and wait in the longer line
---
5)  Then they tell you they need a utility bill with your address on it.
---
6)  You drive home to get that last item
---
7)  You get there get another number, wait in even longer line.
---
8)  Then they close the window because its lunch time.
---
Rainbows! :)
---
are the masks cosmetic or do they actually have any stats or special abilities attached?
---
Find out on the next episode of...Takes from the West Virginia Hills
---
Two friends and myself have each ran a loose average of 40 Parades (give or take a few) since the limited event began. We were awarded many copies of the common5, but not us or a soul in each event showed or claimed to have gotten any of the rare5.
---
Will be running these non-stop again tomorrow and the rest of the week. Going to sleep now, will leave more feedback tomorrow. 
---
Good luck and good night. 
---
No if a the player you are trying to share the card with alright has it equipped then it will not let you share it
---
Lol same here, even after nuked zones grind I still didnt have to repair.
---
I had the Robobrain boss spawn in the AMS lobby in Watoga and disappear after killing it. All his friends were there bugged out &amp; vogued out in the same position after they were killed but the boss was nowhere to be found. I know it was there and it was a 3* because I used V.A.T.S to get around their smoke screens.
---
So you can grow crops in the rugs?
---
I role play as a raider and I don't go into the other factions quest, but I eventually need certain plans because well I'm a raider, gata drug up n shoot up so I would also like to know how I can get some
---
this is why i use my good ol' tesla rifle for farming / pve events, tags everything for a decent amount of damage in the area once and it's fire rate is good so if needs be i can use it to kill something not too high level quickly if it's an emergency.
---
I know cats who work at r/Bethesda see these subs sometimes.
---
Ah screw this.. I'm speccing back to melee toon. Guns are too much of an hassle with worrying about ammo, repairs and.. annoying bugs like this.
---
It's a typeface tbh
---
I know cats who work at r/BethesdaSoftworks see these subs from time to time and have made a difference in some ways in the past so maybe....
---
On PC?
---
TL;DR collect beeswax from the hives at the Fachnat Parade event and server hop. 
---
PVE instigating will one shot most enemies, Bloodied is better for PvP tho. 
---
Ive been hit in the face by a few of their nukes, doesn‚Äôt actually do that much damage 
---
yup class freak  only lose 1 strength..and if your always in a team use herd mentality.
---
It still happens. I was in a server the other day and a group of really high level 300+ players gave everyone the best hour I've ever had on the game.
---
They had 3 people at every solo and launched 3 nukes on prime one after the other. They baited the out of the nuke zone and after she died their friend would launch the next nuke.
---
Killed the queen 3 times in like 20 minutes. 
---
How did you go about building under the bridge like this, I kind of get it but I don't have enough pictures here to quite understand it fully! 
---
It looks cool as hell! How you have it lined up to the bridge above too.
---
Seems like the investigation isnt complete
---
It used to or still does this when you have 2 of the same type of headwear. More so a hat. It will make your character bald at the top of his/her head. Happened to me when I was a level 20 back in December 
---
A genocide run, eh?
---
You‚Äôre gonna have a bad time.
---
Yeah, they the metal stairs and turn white. Says if I try remove them you won't be able to access where I have them even though there were no stairs before, now I can't remove it. Happened twice .. really annoying.
---
Just because you can‚Äôt do something, doesn‚Äôt mean others are grieving you; you‚Äôre just a snowflake...
---
Why is everyone so eager to just sit in their CAMPs and do nothing. Would seeing somebody's set up and using a vending machine be _so_ inconvenient?
---
Nuke Silo's are easily soloed with lockpick and hacker perks, if you want to take them slow. Check each terminal for turret shutdowns, and I reccomend skipping the reactor event with the lockpick door. Other than that. brign soem miens for early warning in the final scenario for where the robots are coming from and keep your eyes open!
---
Title made me think of my ex-wife
---
I don't think it's very rare I have one and have seen a lot {f people with them.
---
These video game investigations are srs business.
---
I remember being able to check items while trading with a vendor but I noticed it stopped working a while back, I am positive that they will fix it before legendary vendor
---
I like the helmets. That's about it...
---
no no no, not for everyone, because high quality rewards means that event should also have high quality challenge. Now if you have such event and everyone can partake it, it kills the point of gearing yourself up inside the game, because you can be level 10 with simple pipe pistol or you can be level 100 with full \*\*\* set and yet you both get same rewards. Take the current state of the game. No one really gears up for SBQ, because you can be level 10 with nonexisting gear and still succeed in that event and get rewarded just like players who are using special ammo. Only reason people actually bother gearing up is because of PVP.
---
Ahhh okay. I almost went that route as well but then found a good few legendary heavies and went full heavy. Just really dig the bang for the buck of all my 2 or 3 weight auto grenade launcher or missile launcher (have a daisycutter that weighs basically nothing). Good luck out there!
---
Check out the link. It has more photos.
---
The Devs said something about whether certain robots live or die. I've been wanting to do tests letting specific robots die, but it's impossible with everyone doing the event along side me. If this truly is the way to get the different masks, then the Devs screwed us because you can't co-ordinate everyone in the event
---
I have been wanting to make a tiny house in 76. I love tiny houses as well. I tried it out with my second character and it‚Äôs alright. Probably be much better with my main that has plans for almost everything. But I‚Äôm definitely doing to do it in the future. 
---
In fallout 4 I would make houses out of the train carts for settlers. Tiny and easy to decorate. Nice to have something different than the regular wood houses or whatever. 
---
Hopefully they add them in this game. I loved the train carts so much! 
---
My suggestion is to scramble the turret‚Äôs targeting system. This way the turrets will take out most of the robots and you can easily pick off the leftovers. 
---
Same experience here. If the nuke zone is up you might get the request to turn in intestines but can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs truly event breaking stuff and I hope they plan better in the future. Only way around it is to overstock before joining as far as I can tell.
---
You can also stand on top of them with while in PA. Quite strong balloons.
---
Funny, chased it yesterday for the first time. Didn‚Äôt know what to expect. FT 3 times. Waited for it @ Grafton steal and shot it out of the sky with a maxed out handmade. Wasn‚Äôt a hard thing to do. 
---
Aight, I'm sold. I mean, I still dislike the arms and chest, but the legs and helmet are things I'd spend atoms on, definitely.
---
... or scrap
---
It shows that you are offline.
---
Sure sounds like you could benefit from double fisting some beerstiens friend. Breathe easy and enjoy the commotion cuz people are just excited for their rewards. 
---
Not to mention, it only takes 1 person to click-light and you clearly are the right survivor for the job so problem solved!
---
Happy Fasnacht!!!
---
I was expecting a bunch of comments calling me out on overreacting and whining like a petulant, entitled little boy (which I most certainly am). Instead there are offers of help and advice.
---
I'm continuously pleasantly surprised by the people here.
---
I never knew I needed such wholesome content 
---
I'm not on PC, unfortunately, but I have been _attempting_ a rifleman build. Unfortunately, it's a bit... Everywhere, since I was stupid and made it up as I went along as opposed to planning it out.
---
Nope, went from level 50 to 100 doing the grenade xp glitch at launch with my mates. 
---
I am not against rainbows per se, but this is Fallout, it should be dark, please make the rainbow monochromatic
---
Thanks for the offer, but I'm not on PS4. I appreciate it, though.
---
You‚Äôve seen? Or the telephone saw?
---
Really? I have mine in Vault Tech colour. I might change it back!
---
Well, for the record man, I've always believed you. I found it pretty hypocritical that everyone spent the first 2 months highlighting Bethesda's ineptitude, but the second they do something the community agrees with, all of a sudden everyone's like "oh there's no way they could have made any mistakes doing *that* thing. You must just be a cheating douchebag liar."
---
Is ‚Äòdisturbing‚Äô really the word we‚Äôre going with here? 
---
I played it twice. First time I received the Fasnacht Beret. Second time I played, I received the  giant mask and fasnacht donut plan. Both times, we lost no robots.
---
I've not spent much time in Watoga, barring sprinting between covered areas and begging the robots not to shoot me. I really need to do Mayor For A Day...
---
Bla bla bla byeee
---
Odd, may be an unaccepted friend request causing it. Have accepted all who have added so far.
---
I can definitely use it so not an issue really to keep.
---
Difficulty is not part of Fallout 76's vocabulary. Difficulty is a barrier that might interfere with Atom Shop purchases. Now if difficulty could be overcome with Atom Shop purchases, there might be place for this word in Fallout 76's vocabulary.
---
I‚Äôve taken all the locks off everything and I will see what happens. 
---
I hope you realize that it really doesn't take that much time to reach level 117.
---
Wow, two offers of help. I _am_ on Xbox, but I don't have a mic. So I'm a terrible teammate lol
---
I think on pc. I heard a streamer talking about it. Sad thing is, they forgot about mistress of mystery :( (or whatever her name is lol) 
---
Woah, save some women for the rest of us, daddy-o
---
You're too cool for scrubs like me to compete with
---
You sound like you didn't make that many people angry and now you're trying to get a rise out of the boards. No one cares man. I'm sure everyone just server hopped to another event anyways.
---
Well yeah but it‚Äôs all events, not just doing Fasnacht. This is a safeguard placed to prevent trolling and harassment until after the event is finished. Pretty simple to avoid or navigate around though I feel. 
---
You don‚Äôt seem to want player vending,you want an auction house
---
It's also about the wonders of nature's exploration! Appalachia! The colours in this game are amazing, I'd even accept radioactive rainbows scaling on green and blue, just give us *rainbows*! 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a good PvE gun but most people who spend lots of caps want more PvP focused gear. That could be good for taking out bloodied builds but since it‚Äôs 1 star I‚Äôd say about 1k would be fair 
---
I am rather intrigued by fallout pvp. I love shooter games and fallout has a ton of complexities and mechanics to it.  That being said there is a very steep learning curve and a lot balancing issues that need to be addressed with the current PvP interaction system. PvP only servers sounds quite nice if the rewards are fitting. I quite enjoy the task of hunting/battling a talented player. You learn way more from challenging opponents in any type of competition. I love helping, trading and doing events with random people in a pve aspect but a good pvp challenge adds a great aspect to the game that can never be satisfied by npcs.
---
I only use it if people want to talk to me as my dog barks a-lot and it becomes annoying for the other players.
---
So the only non cosmetic rewards are the two recipes?
---
Legendary vendors coming in May! Mod all your legendary armor to ultra light until then. 
---
 I'm suggesting Watoga because the robots help you, but if you don't want suggestions for making it easier than you do you I guess.
---
Cosmetic
---
You mean Toothy? Or do you actually have 2 blue face Old Man Winter masks? 
---
Picturesssssss
---
omg I'm dumb sometimes. I have class freak but forgot what it was for. xD 
---
That's fucked up
---
I think the changes they made to prevent people from loading in incorrectly if they open their PipBoy too soon may be contributing to this. Sure, I no longer get frozen if I pop open my PipBoy, but load times have increased. Honestly, I don't mind because I open my PipBoy almost out of habit every time. As long as this doesn't translate into long load times after fast traveling, I'm okay with it. So far it hasn't affected fast travel load times for me.
---
I don't know if the game has ever really frozen when I'm eating food, but I did notice a small lag today between when I ate and when it played the audio. Nothing too dramatic but it was noticeable. Not a deal breaker though.
---
I'm on PC.
---
Shhh this is a well thoughout, tested and programmed game. It has no bugs, only features. ;p
---
Unyielding armor increases charisma. Charisma affects pubic event rewards.
---
Almost every time I get to the event it‚Äôs bugging in this fashion. I have to run outside the event and repay to ‚Äújoin‚Äù up to 4 times or more  before it triggers. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Your preparedness is making someone at bethesda sweaty lol. well played.
---
This really annoys me as I'm sure before release bethesda said the vast majority of stuff in the atom shop if not all would still be able to be found in through normal means of gameplay. I could just be imaging that they said that however so please someone correct me if I'm  wrong.
---
Not only that, but they work so slowly! I always Camp near/on water now for the fast fill!! 
---
I'm not feeling your pitch. What is your point? : ) Great photo. That getup works really well together.
---
These are ancient artifacts of lost concept of the game, where same minded people, with these things had to group up together to unlock mystical power that was protected by mystical monsters. 
---
That sounds like fun!
---
Certainly eye catching. Owl be waiting to see your next post.
---
You say nope but then show exactly what I said. The Forrest Operative Underarmor is Enclave... you‚Äôve found and learned the Enclave Shielded plan so you have craft the Shielded Mod. Which is exactly what your pic is showing. Drop the underarmor and you won‚Äôt see the ability to craft the shielded mod at the armor workbench. 
---
So, Yup!
---
I don't know I did my first nuke at level 50 or so, with regular sniper rifle and lever action rifle, took me hour or so and few deaths, but I got it done and at that time I didn't know about hacking computers. 
---
That's awesome! I'd never considered using Unyielding for a Cha buff before
---
Thanks for the info, not sure why I got downvoted though 
---
Duping still happens , but they can't dupe in vast quantities anymore do to being flagged by Bethesda . I won't mention how they do it , but it's pretty simple once someone knows how . I don't dupe though , but guaranteed I've most likely purchased several duped items post patch from reddit . 
---
That is really cool but I got people helping already. Thanks
---
What you're saying does make sense. I'd like to see more people come forth with the same issue, if they have it, for Beth to take steps to correct it.
---
Indeed, this game is far from finished and what little content we have atm isn't even patched properly (not to mention the game engine in its core).
---
I hope your problems are resolved soon. Good luck
---
I guess I should try planning ahead a liiiiittle bit more.
---
No problem friend if you ever need serums anything hmu
---
Now _that's_ a good idea. Thanks for the advice!
---
With all the people complaining about NOT being able to get a shot in the sloth, I don't think they will be slowing down and helping out our robuddies any time soon. üòû
---
I wasn't trying to discredit your advice or whatever you think my intention was, there. I'm just saying I don't have much knowledge of the over all layout of the town and I don't know how to get to building tops/how to make the bots chill out/how to tie my own shoelaces/where babies come from.
---
Thanks for the advice, and I'll try it out
---
i know from the Wild Appalachia trailer that there is going to be a new unarmed weapon most likely constructed from a sheepsquatch skull. Hopefully there'll be new riffles as well!
---
All these comments are good, but the magic ingredient that's missing most is the community chat mod. Far more organization and sense of community was provided. Now it feels like a ghost town.
---
Oh, ok. Thanks
---
I get this a lot. I usal hop if I get kicked while farming flux to find another blast zone so it feels like salt in the wounds that you can't go back to where you were kicked buy keep popping up on the same server after.
---
We all overlook things sometimes.
---
What a bunch of Wingdings!
---
Hi mam, this build needs 60th level at least. Otherwise you wont get all the perk cards in. Until this level just build towards it. 
---
That happened to me earlier. I waited until it became a meat pile then it became lootable. 
---
Just can't get a break in life, can we?
---
Don‚Äôt worry about it, I‚Äôm in UK, and can probably help tonight, or over the weekend? I think I even have a spare keycard you can have. Don‚Äôt worry about a mic, all you need is plenty of ammo, a good few stimpacks and a key to launch the nuke. If it gets desperate I‚Äôll message you over Xbox, I use the app on my phone which makes it so much easier.
---
It‚Äôs probably just a skin for the death claw gauntlet or power fist sadly...
---
Spoken like a true raider
---
purified water and bulked junk are excellent sources of income
---
Atom shop ;)
---
I certainly have it within me to be ambitious. [Here's my biggest and most robust settlement from Fallout 4, for instance](https://old.reddit.com/r/falloutsettlements/comments/5jmdsy/after_nearly_a_year_of_playing_this_game_i/). I just need to really stretch my wings in this game. 
---
Even though your post kind comes of as toxic as well (shots fired sorry), I do agree that the FO76 community is so self righteous is sickening.
---
And no, no email or communication from Bethesda what so ever - only the original suspesion email (you have more than blah blah rare items - fix will lift suspension).
---
Then don't do the poll
---
You came back at a bad time for server stability. Avoid the parade and that should help. But if you see a bunch of people going there, change servers. 
---
same, more interested in farming loot than leveling, but I'm down for whatever, really.
---
Bye Felicia
---
how can it be exactly 0? ELI5?
---
Ehh idk it‚Äôs the internet, take a look at the roadmap Bethesda released online. Some people don‚Äôt like when people ask for something that‚Äôs already in development. I prefer to point you in the right direction but I wouldn‚Äôt get too worried about downvotes. Say what you mean and mean what you say and no matter how many downvotes at least you‚Äôre not lying. 
---
Yea I raid sometimes, however that‚Äôs not the point. We all have to grind that‚Äôs part of the game. But this person is asking others to grind an event a couple dozen more times just because they cannot keep up, and I‚Äôm bad guy? I‚Äôm just being honest. 
---
It‚Äôs funny I used to help new players, but Bethesda made me into the man I am today. 
---
Its an amazing event for farming mini nukes btw. I get around 5 or 6 per event. I never used my TS Fatman this often thanks to it.
---
What‚Äôs messed up is they got so many innocent people with the dupers. That‚Äôs like the cops arresting the whole town cause their are some criminals in it. It is totally possible to collect 100,000 of some items I easily can go through that many rounds in a month( I play a lot every day)and I use the same type for most part. And I trade choice weapons for lots of ammo cause everything in fallout is just a frickin bullet sponge. I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs how I got banned. Ammo is the only thing I have had a lot of.  It just blows my mind Bethesda could treat us like this. It should be illegal to sell me a game then kick me off for no reason.  And many people just came upon a box with tons of materials or nuka colas and didn‚Äôt know better. Hell I‚Äôve ran up to boxes and spammed x before even looking I don‚Äôt know how many times. 
---
A continuous distribution in probability theory is like an infinite sided die. So saying that any one side of the die will roll face up is zero. This is, to be fair, a bad analogy. The real reason is that in probability theory, uniform distribution is a density, and probability is a mass. As a zero dinensional point cannot enclose any mass, probability of finding any one point is zero.
---
I and A buddy tried, didn't worküòë will just have to stick with grape mentats and sweet rolls i guess~
---
All i want is the beret but it wont drop ‚Ä¶ :(
---
Yeah I found it its dope
---
I just stumbled upon this. I have a thought. IF it is tied to the underground areas, it most likely will be a monster infected overgrowth. You have 4 "recepies" with those you can craft those 4 components and I guess those test sides are plausible as well. 1 Robot is missing, one is active (billings farm) others are unresponsive. So we have one location to look forward to!
---
Haha, actually can't argue with that :)
---
I agree. I've never really been into pvp or co-op play but the new event was the most fun I've had in game in ages.
---
Everyone in this game is so friendly. Posing for photos and defending robots was so fun. 
---
Wrong. It's another plant.
---
Well, everybody has a different taste, but I'm sure that the classic combat armor is completely different from the pictures anyway because it's possibly not very accurate to what it really looks like in Fallout 1 and 2 since it was a little bit 8-bit and hard to distinguish the true appearance of the armor but it isn't that bad since it is based on the classic combat armor and it looks very cool. 
---
Shhhh! Lol
---
OIL?
---
Is it rare? I've got two of them...
---
They should make you pvp with bare fists lol.
---
Don‚Äôt forget repeatedly vaping right into the mic.
---
poop sock gone wrong gone gone friend edition 2019
---
It‚Äôs only the small animals :) 
---
Clip size is 8
---
Yes just relog in a different server. I had this problem with the critical shot and it worked after 3/4 hops. 
---
It‚Äôs expensive to repair,I use x01 instead
---
I spend more time building my Camp than *literally anything else.*
---
Howdy to all the fellow Wasteland Architects ;D
---
just waiting for the "refresh this spawn cooldown for atoms" 'feature' to be added
---
It‚Äôs be nice if the ninja sneak attack bonus applied, but I think only covert operatives can boost it from sneak
---
Not condemning you or anything play the way you play.  I tend to help new players because I RP a responder. But I won't knock someone for not waiting on others to get a hit.  Honestly do you bro. As long as you're having fun I won't knock your style. 
---
Could it be that other players might be swapping their almost consumed cores with the ones with higher charge on the frames?
---
Thank god for that
---
Would always play at
---
#maximum volume!!!
---
Until settings loaded in...
---
Does it play for you?
---
bless
---
But how did you get out? 
---
You sound like an angry person.
---
Actually, I‚Äôm pretty sure the decreased budget cost for turrets allowed you to place another turret.  Lights‚Äô budget cost were greatly reduced and had a numerical cap placed, similar to turrets with a separate cap
---
Happy cake day 
---
I'm only level 5. Can I do it. Still have no idea what I'm doing. So far, just playing it like I'm playing Fallout 4. Doing quest, collecting junks and crafting. The only difference is the constant hunger and thirst. So far, I'm enjoying it. I just feel like I'm not ready for the social aspect of the game yet. 
---
Charisma is ment to get you better drops from team events but don't know if it's true or not 
---
Out of curiosity, whats the issue you're trying to get addressed? 
---
it really is mostly the distance. Due to it being a) high in the air and b) usually not just vertically away from oneself but also horizontally it makes the damage drop considerably.
---
Maybe you could also make use of weapons like a rocket launcher, for example the legendary one you get for becoming a general at the Enclave. It has a target computer so hitting the bot shouldnt be a problem and it wont get a damage penalty for the distance.
---
Yeah it's annoying to have to go to 3rd person view to aim while invisible.
---
I got murdered by a bunch of people to be fair I attacked another player so I‚Äôm not that upset 
---
Once the turrets run out of robots they'll start targeting you. 
---
All I want is PvE-specific servers. Or for pacifist mode to actually mean true pacifist. Would be fantastic.
---
D3 did looting right until that stupid account bound crap.
---
Couldn‚Äôt have said it better myself
---
I'd wait and see first because there's always a chance it may be new characters only if they've really listened to what people want. 
---
Hmm...I'll check tomorrow to see what other mods I have and let you know 
---
Rank 1 costs 2 points
---
This is exactly what happened with me yesterday, it was all very confusing since I haven't seen workshop contest message and I was one/two-shot at the event. I was later wondering what's up with workshop being unowned...
---
Were talking about more ammo than can fit in your STASH.  It's an unusually high number for something that is basically dead weight in a game with a limited inventory mechanic but yeah its *possible* these bullets are legitimate.
---
Id guess the devs can whats in your inventory goes up and/or if the inventory of bullets increases at the rate they would expect when your rate of lead and steel are decreasing.  I would expect a large total number or a large one-time increase in bullets to be a red flag.  Upon getting flagged the account gets looked into and action is taken if they believe your inventory levels show unattainable numbers of items.  
---
I recall the email 900hr guy posted saying his account and one associated with him were being banned.  Any account that regularly traded with their duper "associate" looks to be getting punished as well.
---
I know console players fall out of the boat, but for those on PC, there's the mod [Save Everything](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/148) that does exactly that: &gt;Prevents users from accidentally dropping/selling/scrapping their favorited and equipped items, inspired by the now-defunct mod Save My Stuff.  
---
Adds the ability to type quantities and prices into most transfer menus, instead of having to use the slider.
---
This depends whether they do some balancing and whether it's existing or new characters. I'll personally only play if it's new characters. 
---
Brilliant! I love the split level living :D
---
1) Primarily strength, but with a fair amount of charisma, agility or luck to suit your preference
---
+
---
2) slugger and any other 2-handed melee-related perk cards like incisor, blocker, etc.
---
3) decent team buffing/healing cards like quack surgeon, but definitely get friendly fire!
---
4) wield a Mr. Handy buzzsaw and a flamethrower/plasma flamer
---
5) wear a bowler hat

I did the exact same thing....
---
I moved everything off my second account to my first after I was unbanned about the time I got it moved BAMM banned again. Now on second account with no guns ammo or aid.  I have never duped but had a lot of ammo I would trade between my characters and friends that has to be what got me banned. I don‚Äôt get how they build trading into game then ban me for it. Bethesda hates gamers!
---
I'm the same way, I'm mostly hoping I can display them eventually. Yeah none of the clothing has been really worth buying so far. No prob :)
---
I've just built a new CAMP along the road south of Morgantown I named Old Roadhouse and made it into a small bar. Not long after there was a visiter who looked around and then saw me standing behind the bar and sat down infront of me. I offered a trade and put up a lot of different beverages for a cap. He bought one sat for a while and then waved and moved on. I absolutely loved it. I got a friend request from that player a little later. I've had more since and think it's great.
---
It's also my alt (lvl 29) that I play now because I was "finished" with the CAMP of my main (lvl 162) and wanted to make a new one. With the help of some friends I got my and theirs duplicate plans to the new character and could build stuff quickly.
---
Maybe this?

---
Definitely not if ur always diseased.
---
correct, all cores in spawned PA is at 25% , all over the map :( been like this since patch 7...
---
You get banned again?
---
For your second question, yes, you can heal with different kinds of food, healing salve (you need to get a plan to make this) and different kind of Nuka cola can also heal a few HP for you. The forest area is nice, search everything and get all the junk, this you can use to repair weapons, armor and build all kinds of stuff in the game. Look for legendary items, junk, healing, ammo etc. And server hopping is a good choice if you want to farm specific items. Hope this helps. You can always DM me if you want more questions answered. 
---
and welcome to the fallout community, hope you are having an amazing time here!
---
The problem is I‚Äôve made so many great friends on fallout and invested so much time. I really can‚Äôt believe I still want to play the game. It will be the last time I EVER buy anything from Bullythesda. 
---
Didn‚Äôt notice it today
---
May have had my volume down, was a few hrs ago
---
Thanks!
---
Thats why i cant run max perception...
---
That is Badass!! Building in 4 was amazing... I use to crash the game with the eternal-build mod xD
---
Its actually around 70lb with perk cards, i carried it on me.
---
Unfortunately their algorithm only takes into account what enters a persons inventory. It doesn't check a source, hence trading ammo back and forth will trigger it. Mine would spike 30k every few days because id save up materials. Its quite amazing how much you can carry when you run a full weight reduction build.
---
The players I often team with have our CAMPs spread out to have free fast travel points near interesting places. Morgantown, Whitesprings, Harpers Ferry and so on.
---
Ohh thats a great way to play!
---
2x2 metal house with bed, stash, fishlamp, cooking pot, fusion generator, and every single station - new and old - except PA inside.  I think of it as my cozy little sweatshop (meltshop?)

I tried every combo, and just freshly crafted gatling plasma. All the same. Only impact color changes from red to green, no projectiles.

My first one I was using a flamer to burn him when somebody said just click on it... I still flame it üòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Ah, feels like old times with 21" CRT Monitors :D
---
There is a significant difference between PvP and being one-shotted with barely any warning.
---
But did you run into the nuke zones before or after lunch??  Details like this are important...
---
I have a disease most of the time. So maybe skip this  mutation.
---
Kinda off topic but this is a massive issue in fallout vr. Qt least on a flat panel you have a good idea of where the center of the screen is, in vr you might as well be blind firing.
---
This happened to a player as I was trading masks, his head vanished and we had a laugh about it.
---
cant guarantee theyre accurate, but i keep stats on all my items. Certainly not complete, but its a starting point.   
---
If you make a copy, there are two hidden sheets thats are the unfiltered  lists.
---
Or was he using it to heal the ghouls, trolling others?
---
At the risk of sounding a bit Charie Bucket-y, I've done the parade 5 times,  no signs of rare masks on any participants... of which there were many. 
---
Modern Warfare 2 hardcore matches callback
---
I see you never been in contact with Microsoft support...
---
They told me to be "patient" after one month of no feedback...
---
It‚Äôs probably more likely that you were accidentally unbanned. Then it was fixed, right?
---
Some of the jumpsuits from events are 0.25% drop rate on, 1 of 400. I could think that they could do it with one mask, but not 4! 
---
That's possible. But we were never actually banned just suspended. So if they tell us that then cool, it is how it is. 
---
Apparently not since the last update. Also i have 0 turrets, and even if i had any i can delete it but cant rebuild it
---
It is maxed out with 4 points, not 3 points
---
Yup, I fucking hate this sub but it's also why I keep coming back.
---
Because your experience is in the vast minority. assuming you did have enough time on your hands to make that much ammo. Most people don‚Äôt. 
---
Big time agree with you. I‚Äôve only received one email from them and all it was was a small list of what I did wrong and why they suspended me. That was in February. They have since done this ‚Äúworldwide‚Äù unban and letting people play again. Yet my account is still suspended. One of my good friends who played since beta got suspended for duping and stockpiling ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù items and just last weekend he was all of a sudden allowed to play again after submitting a ticket. I‚Äôve submitted 4 tickets and sent back 5 emails and I‚Äôm still suspended, and I didn‚Äôt even do any of the glitches, I just accepted the countless number of items my friend gave me. What I didn‚Äôt need I‚Äôd throw away like many other players who got banned for either helping friends knowingly or not with their cheating ways.So please Bethesda, tell us what the hell is going on????? My game has literally updated 5 times since the ban. I want to fucking play again. Almost lvl 200 with maybe around 500hrs in game. COME ON! Lol end rant. 
---
This is the only item I actually want üòÇ
---
I don't get what is the issue here. Hits are still registering, and you can see impacts. 
---
It's only a graphical issue then ?
---
Sorry not to mention they also said I‚Äôd be able to play again as soon as possible, that they trying to get a fix/update out. Pretty sure that‚Äôs already happened.....sooooooo.....
---
Yes. Place the rug on dirt, place the crop at the edge of the rug, pick up the rug and the crop comes too. Water purifiers and pumps do the same thing. 
---
[Once i had Hunter/hunted event while doing SBQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrt4vZYMaH8&amp;t=216s) Yeah vats don't target players while doing event, even hostitle enemies cannot be targeted with it, but still you can disapear with one shot from TSE shotgun.
---
Aiming down your sight doesnt happen in CQB in real life, its point and shoot
---
If unban was gonna happen, bethesda would have notified us first. Always thought it was kinda weird some of the worst dupers got unbanned as well. Would make sense if it was a mistake
---
You can put headwear on your invisible head as well! I've been using a fedora and bottlecap glasses to dress up as the invisible man
---
Geeze, this whole time I thought it was on purpose!  Like they made the travel time of high-powered plasma shots nearly instantaneous, rather that about as fast as, say, a really good baseball pitch.
---
You sir deserve a TSE in your next drop, thanks!!!
---
This bug has been in since launch, I‚Äôve talked about it many times. To undo the effect, you could have triggered the chameleon mutation again by unequipping everything and getting a weapon out. 
---
Again, maybe you're right. I just want to know. I took all my stuff from my other account and put it on my old account so if I am truly banned and not suspended I'd like to know.
---
Maybe they somehow bugged it to where you have to have Dromedary on at the same time for the diluted Stims to work?
---
3rd person. You¬¥r welcome
---
Yeah maybe, so they should clarify it instead of saying nothing.... Try not being typical Bethesda for once
---
Multiple hard bargains don‚Äôt stack, but Magnetic Personality (and various mentats) will...
---
Yesterday my base was under attack of a 2 SB lvl 80 and a mirelurk queen lvl 52. Killed them all and got only trash rewards.
---
Yep mine goes to 114% I don‚Äôt want to farm nuke zones for flux to make them but maybe thats why all we find is 25% cores
---
I just want to know exactly what's going on.
---
Loving seeing everyone in costume. Got some good reactions when people saw me eat a corpse as well (one player did the radiation throwing up in response then another dropped a ton of radway for him)
---
Mmm good point. Didn't think of that.
---
What did you do to get your account back? I picked up a few damn items after my buddy dropped them for me, threw away everytime what I didn‚Äôt need and they decide I‚Äôve been stockpiling and duplicating. Been suspended since before February. My friend got banned too, but he got his account back last weekend, after just submitting a ticket :(
---
They said atoms can be gotten through normal game play, not the items themselves. Some of the stuff is just clean versions of things that already exist in the game
---
Yes they are naked for everyone, cause they are suiciders, check fallout4.
---
Does plauge walker have a downside? I'm guessing not? Because the downside is you have to be diseased
---
A friend of mine server hopped at Grafton train station for a few hours and was able to get these mods.
---
I was perma banned in January wave, appealed it then heard nothing for 2 months until I got the email saying I was only just ‚Äúsuspended for having 100k rare items‚Äù but yet I still can‚Äôt login to Bethesda.net (due to the original ban) and no communication or reply to tickets LOL what a shit show.
---
There‚Äôs an INT perk you probably need, [Power Smith](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Power_Smith/Fallout_76) 
---
K I'll check when I get on today
---
What is your error code now? I‚Äôm getting a way longer one than the 2000 one.
---
There is no downside. It just does work well with instigating because the enemy needs to be full health for that to work. 
---
They rarely reply to us lowlifes lol
---
Screw that. I want the support for "True Storms" mod!
---
I use instigating as well, so it would mess up my play style if I have plauge walker 
---
Probably wants to confirm suspension.
---
Just keep trying to login twice a day. One day you'll get in.......then you won't again.
---
these pictures are most likely created by messing with the games files, its extremely easy to locally mod some of the unreleased stuff in, as long as the files are already inside the client.
---
I had that on pc, nothing too serious but when I logged back in I noticed I lost progress.
---
It's also a little anoying that the lvl 250 that one-shot that big bad will get a 1\* lvl 30 legendary he will hate and probably just drop somewhere, but my lvl 29 character would love to have some 1\* legendary armor.
---
Fabulous
---
180,000 bullets is 900lb.  
---
Were not taking about someone who crafts and trades a lot were talking about someone who is in possession of more ammo than they can fit in their STASH but apparently only goes around farming the materials to craft more.
---
Wouldnt it be obvious that the ammo is crafted if their ammo went up as their lead and steel went down?
---
Bunnies do as well!
---
I kinda agreed until you A. Totally lied about loot economy and you B. Complained about something that doesn't exist yet.
---
The sentry bots at whitesprings often drop fusion cores with good charge, vats the fusion core to kill the instantly, it doesn't ruin the core either.
---
Yeah, lots of them spawn in the building on the far west side across from the church. Check downstairs and upstairs. 
---
I bought that sharpshooter emote and can't use it with my pistol cause I turn invisible
---
Aiming down sights on a gatling gun says hi
---
That's fair enough, I probably misheard. Guess I'm just salty about the amount of cool things that I either have to earn or buy atoms to get rather than being able to find them in-game as an extremely rare plan.
---
yup has happened to me on PS4 as well
---
Very first attempt froze right as I got smack dab in the middle of the parade.  By the time I logged back in, I missed the event and people had resorted to shooting each other.
---
So yeah, pure 76.
---
I hope the OP gets unbanned I have to admit that I read this post expecting it to be the usual I did nothing wrong ban post. The OP took responsibility for what they did and I believe they would play the game right the second time good luck hopefully the ban gets lifted 
---
Performance has been greatly improved. 
---
The freezing and stuttering can be easily reduced by lowering the field of distance. Like somebody said on this reddit, the field of distance in FO76 is still 3 x the one of FO4. I have a GTX Strix 970 too, try to do this on your display settings:
---
- Fullscreen
---
- set overal quality to custom
---
- lower field of distance (or view whatever it is called) to low
---
- change any other setting as you wish
---
Voila you should have an improved performance.
---
Platform? Did you put in a support ticket? There is another recent post on here about the same thing.
---
Nah it was the lights. Because before the change I had NO Turrets.
---
Not going to argue with your points. Some I kind of agree with, and some I don't. However, and you probably already know this, but the 970 gtx can't perform well with textures set to anything higher than medium. I have that card and I have very smooth game play, although  I've noticed a bit more lag over the last couple of weeks (totally subjective though.
---
Performance.
---
Bitch i playied beta, it is super smoth now on PS4. 400x better than fricking apex. Problem may be on your piece of rusty trash.
---
Interface
---
Cmon, did you play new vegas? skyrim? Fo3? Fo4? morrowind? oblivion? 
---
Loot
---
Idk how you, but i spend 450hours in game and still have things i would like to farm.
---
Weapons
---
Ye some builds are meta, thats how rpgs work?
---
Perk system
---
If it is frustrating to swap perks for you, make your build so you don't need to swap. What you want? diablo? go play diablo
---
PvP
---
pvp is good now, this mode will remove worings from starting pvp and dying first.  "THIS GAME COULD BE BAD, I AM WORIED" go play diablo, it is out for years, you don't have to worry about upcoming things.
---
When you don't like game how it is, you probably aren't kind of player for who this game was developed.
---
From all the posts i see about bans, it seems like of most of them if not all were also involved with mule characters.
---
Maybe Bethesda needs to take a clear position about the use of mules and the consequences.
---
Thanks, I think everyone should be unbanned. I think we are human beings we make mistakes. We all deserve a second chance, the second chance Bethesda offered. That's when you separate the good from the bad.
---
How long is the event cool down? How long is not too long?
---
3 of the 5 marchers had been assembled. I selected the icon from the world map and joined the event while it was still active. 
---
I would assume not, as the head isn't a limb 
---
I did start a new account during the ban. I moved everything from that account over to my old account. Had to destroy like 300 pounds but I don't see why that would be an issue. 
---
Yesterday I did the event 18x.  I got the beret 3x, owl2x, and the rest were the other masks.   At least I got a bunch of the camp plans but once I get those done I think that's it for me until this is made a bit more reasonable.   That burning effigy in front of my base was worth the time though Haha. 
---
If you had played world of warcraf on private servers, you would know "rollback". Server save your progres in some time intervals, if you DC in between you lose some of it. Welcome to online gaming.
---
But it can be crippled.  Anecdotally have not had my head crippled since max rank adamantium skeleton...so maybe?
---
Ouch 
---
Thanks :D
---
She could do some ASMR pornographic noizes.
---
Sure, hop right in! The great thing about it is that the higher level players act as a protection buffer for the lower level players. Just get your shot on an enemy or two. Dont worry about figuring out what needs to be done, just follow the parade and enjoy the event!
---
I didn't know I needed this until I read this post, now I want it soo much! 
---
It would make the rains so much nicer!
---
Double Rainbow!
---
Logout at V76, fast travel to camp after confirmed safe.
---
To be fair it's a Bethesda game, so it's anyone guess, I‚Äôd say no simply because the head isn't a limb, but you raise a good point about the crippling
---
See that's what I was thinking when it comes to pacifying animals. Why not make it so we can get "mounts" instead of vehicles. Riding a ragstag or a hermit crab. Just not the SB. This is of course after they attempt to fix all the major bugs with the game currently. It would be a fun addition, but not something that I feel is "needed".
---
Oh no, let's not start asking for this. Knowing this sub, if they gave you rainbows, it would just start threads like "Am I the Only One who wants Double Rainbows?," and "Where are the Triple Rainbows?!?!? Fix Your Game, Bugthesda!."
---
Lied about the loot economy? What are you talking about?  
---
Complained about something that doesn't exist? It does exist and it will be there for us all to experience in less than a week.
---
Best post!
---
Some people seem to forget that, even though it looks almost exactly the same, THIS IS NOT FALLOUT 4. You cannot enable cheats and get whatever you want without consequences or repercussions in this game. You're ruining other people's experiences by doing this; then again, they probably don't care. If you want to enjoy feeling like a god, kindly do it somewhere else, preferably in a single-player game.
---
‚ÄúLegendary items are just as legendary as wonderglue‚Äù
---
When legendary mobs keep dropping drills, syringers, nothing at all, wooden armor and crappy rolling pins; I would say it‚Äôs a miracle getting anything useful at all. 
---
My apologies, I misread what you wrote - thought you said one MORE turret.
---
Truth. 
---
FBI Open Up !
---
RADBOW
---
Wait a sec the supermutants are up to lvl 60 for you in West Tek? I feel cheated, every time I go there they are always lvl 79 which makes it hard for me with a rifle. 
---
Congrats, you just described me, i specifically use junkie weapons while addicted to whatever i can manage, and go on a tear. Once somebody caps me for my bounty my addictions are gone too. Nice adventure, especially taking people on a chase. 
---
Also need to tse the water under the bridge for booms.  This is a must.
---
You never know what's classified as what in games. Even if it's a stupid sounding question, you never really know. Like how the aluminum trays in this game don't actually contain aluminum... or how a flip lighter has a spring, but the golden flip lighter doesn't. The M79 grenade launcher is intentionally affected by Bear arms, so it's technically a heavy weapon like the fatman, missile launcher, and auto launcher, yet it's the size of rifle.
---
In a Fallout game ? No. They should rather focus the time they have for developing weather features to make actual rad storms that are seriously dangerous + buff enemies and not just a mild inconvenience.
---
My son (xbone) introduced his two friends to the parade. They were not aware of it beforehand. He found the parade a bit laggy and was kicked from the server. He joined back in before it ended but must have been too late. He didnt get a reward but his two friends did. I felt so sorry for him. I on the otherhand (ps4) had no reward issues and I've done the parade 5 times.
---
That‚Äôs what I mean by absolutely no good 
---
Is an atom shop item called the silver shroud.
---
Graphical yes, but unable to see the projectiles makes it worse on hectic situations to aim at things. Seeing the plasma helps spraying everything. Aaaand when you are customed to seeing them and suddenly they are taken away by bug its annoying as hell.
---
Yeah I noticed that too and thought wth is going on.
---
Our camp got destroyed earlier and he kept destroying the generator. This was a gongbox1504 on the Xbox. 
---
Give us Radbows instead, they should be green. We also need snow, Green snow for radiation blizzards. 
---
agreed, I almost immediately thought about this after launch in NOV. 
---
With evil leprechauns guarding pots of caps at one end.
---
The number of stars an enemy shows has no effect on the number of stars of the loot it drops. You're not getting a three star weapon from a three star enemy, a two star weapon from a two star enemy, etc. 
---
Out of curiosity have all the robots survived for all 57 runs?
---
I'm starting to get annoyed with Bethesda's lack of respect and practices for Fallout 76. Bugs are one thing, but impossible drop odds and pushing advertisement of these "rare" masks is insulting. Better chances winning the lottery.
---
Bethesda need to get their act together, and stop following the path of greedy corporate scum who only care for micro transactions. Square Enix has lost my business, don't want the same for Bethesda.
---
I have seen significantly less legendary enemies since the last patch in general. 
---
I always keep a low damage weapon in my bag for such occassions, 
---
I do seriously hate those at the WS who just go around killing all the ghouls. We are all there for the same purpose so why one shot everything. 
---
You must‚Äôve failed to realize you *do* have to go specific places to get specific items. In order to get specific rare items I need to farm a specific event in a specific region, or in terms of crafting materials, I need to control a specific workshop or go to a place with the resource I need. How does this not encourage movement around the map? Obviously, nobody has to do those things, but you can‚Äôt say they aren‚Äôt giving you a reason to move.
---
I have the Xbox app it lets me download pics and video clips to my phone and I think you can generate a link too (don‚Äôt ask me how tho)
---
The event happens if you nuke it?  Others have complained that nuking destroys the event and was a jerk move.  I'm confused...
---
It would show many small increases for each time you craft bullets.  The "spike" I'm talking about would be all the bullets appearing at the same time.  Even if all the bullets you made cumulatively in a crafting session registered as one "spike" your lead and steel would still show large decreases at the same time and it would be really obvious that you legit crafted the ammo.
---
In the case of ammo trading I'd guess they would run a similar test on the associated account that lost a lot of ammo around the time the account with the "spike" gained a lot. If the associated account is deemed to have illegitimately created the ammo both accounts get punished.  Though this isn't what you're claiming happened to you, you didnt trade for your ammo you crafted it.
---
Head is not classified as a limb, that was already tested.
---
That‚Äôs the thing two of us had pacifist on and he was one shooting us. With an explosive shotgun. I didn‚Äôt think it was possible either. I thought it wasn‚Äôt suppose to be possible and they were just suppose to do trivial damage. 
---
That is a good point, unfortunately, in games, its anyone‚Äôs guess like you say, never meant to imply I thought it was a stupid question just to clarify 
---
They should make there position clear on a lot if situations. 
---
Ah. thank you.
---
If you're on ps4 it's because people like me went all over Apalachia &amp; picked up every full bottle of booze they could find.
---
Every day it's drink copious amounts of alcohol for challenges so I pick up all of it now because I'm addicted!
---
this joke made me sad
---
Again, you would think they had implemented a system like that. If that had i wouldn't be here complaining. And you are correct i crafted it all yes, and it would register as small increases but that depends on when it checks the players inventory. Seems to do this when you leave or enter a new cell mostly. But i'm not to sure.
---
Think it's time for you to find new friends. You on PC? 
---
I would assume the way Bethesda thinks if it's not the torso it's a limb.
---
Just buy a pilsner.
---
I dunno... part of the fun is 200s and 6s getting together.  I don't think it was meant to be scorchbeasts with mask prizes.  Running around getting the marchers ready seems to be the main challenge versus battle.
---
I still haven't mastered rad control, so I don't do nuke events, but aren't they supposed to be the high level coop event?
---
Unfortunately yeah, minority. It doesn't really take that long. Just depends on how well you can farm the resources required, even easier as a team.
---
That makes sense! Lol I stumbled upon that place within 3 days after release and could not for the life of me figure out those computers. But it‚Äôs a good place to farm. Power armor up top and lots of syringer guns.
---
You play on a PS4? Then how can you comment on PC performance? After all people who play on consoles play with sub-par graphics and seem to be happy with 20-30fps.   
---
The interface is probably fine on a console with only 4 buttons tbf.  PC could have a much more streamlined system with a mouse and keyboard. Both console and PC could benefit from more sub-categories.  Anybody who doesn't think the inventory management is poor must literally have played nothing but Bethesda games. You only need to play a few others survival looting games and come back to Fallout to realise where a lot of your frustration comes from.
---
Thank you!
---
Yes I tend to agree. Thank you!
---
I was hoping it would be a real hoot.
---
That's not exactly true. I've done 2 runs. I got an owl mask and sausage recipe the first time. Jack shit the second time save a few caps. Both times all robots were saved.  So you don't 100% get a mask when all 5 robots are saved. I did get 2 level 35 one star armor pieces and giant sloth meat etc from the boss. Some couldn't loot the boss at all though. A lot of people were bitching about that one. 
---
I traded with him yesterday, he's legit üôÇ
---
Lol. Thanks. 
---
Nah, I'm leaving it for any other. I want to get it by myself!!
---
Was about 3-4h weekdays, weekends where patchy. Depending if i felt like playing, or playing other games. But anywhere from 8-16h on a weekend.
---
Waffle cop! Waffle cop! Waffle cop! Haha :) 
---
There are items that are practically 1 in 1000000 that people get once in a blue moon from event farming (tattered scout jacket). There are rare weapons (chainsaw), rare plans (most big items and the pole hook), ntm that there are legendary combos that are super rare and sell for 5000-10000 caps.
---
It is a common, but there are 5 commons, so.... can still take some grinding.
---
I have 1 owl, 1 witch, 2 bone mans, 2 soldiers...
---
Love the owl tho... so cute.
---
I also have 2 berets... why do people think they are rares?
---
Paid $129.95, tricentennial edition in Aus soo...

Been a fan of their games, have them all. 
---
Done 4 events, got 3 witch masks!! Also twice the final sloth boss failed to drop loot and had 1 server disconnect. Any loot dropped from enemies are very low level too. I got a level 25, one star, vampire hatchet out of all 4 attempts. Hardly the kind of rewards that want to keep you coming back time and again. Looking on the bright side of the fastnacht quest is that Whitesprings golf club is now a lot less busy.
---
I myself have never understood the reason behind exploiting or outright cheating at games. It doesn't make you good, in fact it makes you so BAD you have to break the rules to get what you want. If you are going to cheat, why bother playing a game with rules at all? I think it's psychological. Some people have so little sense of self-worth or individual power in real life that they have to get it vicariously by being tools anonymously on the internet. Take the anonymity away and people do not behave that way, since they know the rest of society will take them to task for being an irritating fuckstick and stop them. 
---
same here they are bugged, I just put in a ticket not to long ago.
---
Those Fasnacht robots are currently some of my favorite robots of all time. I love this event. 
---
He's health going back up on your screen after dropping to zero is 'normal' for any build with a lot of % reductions it's server issue i think. I was testing it and on he's end you were barely doing any dmg. The fact that you were able to down him with vats indicates that he wasn't cheating. A lot of combat mechanics in this game can be learned only by experimentation it doesn't help that skill descriptions and legendary effects descriptions are often misleading.
---
What happens if you kill a bot in the event?
---
I use LMGs and when you ADS, your crosshair disappears. Even the front sight on the Gatling Gun is useless. I just memorized where the crosshair should be and snipe with them.
---
Yeah forgot about console players us PCMR got some juicy push to talk :D
---
I would recommend not bothering with PvP until we have the new survival mode which should be in Beta in the next few weeks unless plans have changed.
---
There will almost certainly have to be balancing changes to make it work and we currently have no idea what they are.
---
The scenario you are describing isn't even the worst experience I've seen, wait till you try to PvP someone with a full set of Sentinel/Assassins armor :)
---
Till Tuesday I do believe 
---
&gt;Yes okay there are specific legendary items that have a low probability of dropping, my point was that legendary items as a whole are plentiful as much of what else is needed in this game. I don't understand why people have such a hard time finding things as I am absolutely stacked. I spend more time sat in my stash trying to work out what I want to keep and what I want to get rid of than actually out having fun.   
---
&gt;Well regardless - This game still has a long way to go as far as I can tell. I do hope they sort it. 
---
You get a quest from biv. Complete it and you get another 24 hours later.  So yeaaaa once a day. 
---
I'm not sure if the quests stack
---
Why shouldn‚Äôt there be a down side to using it?
---
When you put the Sight ring on a gatling and aim it still shows but is widely off the mark for where you are actually aiming.
---
Most people that claim to have seen a cheater gets downvoted, because most of the time they are just seeing Op builds and equipments, or just lag and bugs (when a player is downed switch to another weapon, or to melee, it's just a bug).
---
Anyway I've seen a lot of websites that sell cheats like wallhacks or aimbots (nothing that makes you unkillable), I don't even know if I can share those links...
---
No.
---
They could even just add autolock to the favorite heart tag.  Was surprised this wasn't part of the heart tag, tbh
---
Is there an update on the poll? just wondering if the rare mask has dropped yet or nah.
---
Following for this advice also
---
There's already a great way to get junk in the game. Just go pick it up.
---
Junk is so common and everywhere. And it's well thought out. 
---
The fact that the majority of people complain they need more storage means people have to MUCH junk. I certainly do. 
---
Just collect full set of unyielding for your trade route, keep in mind selling value have a hard cap at 25% of item value and buying is capped at 250% (or close to that) of item value. As well worth to know you can hit hard cap by just boosting charisma without mentats or hard bargain.
---
My guild was able to force one bot to get killed by suiciders (the joyous musician specifically). He was not lootable and the end reward was unchanged.
---
The core issue of the game is lack of content making you do everything 50 times. This game would be good if it had 1/8th the quests other fallouts have instead of a small number they expect you to repeat endlessly 
---
Works good I have the same on my tv....hip shot dot. I used a red plastic lid from dollar store. Has a slight red glow
---
21 or 26 march
---
Ah thank you
---
Thanx
---
Mmmm yes well it was around 7:30p when I posted and, while I‚Äôm old, I‚Äôm not quite so old yeah I‚Äôm already in bed by then. üòâ
---
Be on a team and share rad sponge, power armor is still needed tho. As long as you stay close to each other rad sponge will eliminate all rads
---
If you want gore then equip Cannibal... Instead of only reviving people in the downed state you get an option to execute and eat them... Its a little disturbing since they are still there injured when you start eating. 
---
yeah just 1 brahmin per CAMP, and sometimes it kicks me when I'm trying to milk her lol iunno if it's worth it the 10% CAMP budget.
---
Once the zone resets the squirrels come back but mobs continue to respawn as level 68 Scorched Conquerers and Glowing Radtoads etc for a while
---
Makes it a bit more challenging and increases the XP
---
They were complaining about it destroying the event because the nuke makes a bunch of high level enemies span, and the robots die really quick. But it‚Äôs fun to do if you have a bunch of high levels there
---
i think you can go normal armor if you can get you rad resistance high enough, for example a full set of two star trapper armor with lead lining mod (or whatever it was called) and each piece having +25 rad resistance effect. throw in radshield which gives 230 something rad resistance for 15 mins and a couple perks that buff it even more and you should be good to go
---
Customizable banner seems like a much easier thing to ask for in the short term than actual end game content.  Although I agree with you that's not something that can be done overnight.  
---
It's a fresh donut in a nuclear wasteland. What more do you need?
---
Rad sponge is the best 
---
See you there tomorrow
---
1. You need group around you, because as you said, you will be paper and die too often, good agains ghouls and Queen if you have some tanks. Very bad agains super muties.
---
2. T-51 have strongest balistic rezistances, X-01 and ultracite have biggest rad rezist. T-60 have better rad resist than T-51, but lower DR and ER. All of them are viable and you still need rad sponge perk in group or few radaways.
---
3. No chance, i tryied it many ways, without any rezistances it is 60rads per second. You die super fast. With Trapper armor and some rad-X you can go down to 7rads per sec, but no less. There is something that limit minimal rads per sec in zone, when you dont have PA/hazmat. 7rads per second is still relatively much, you may survive for whole period of time, but you will use so much chems thats it is not worth.
---
Damn. I didn't know that lol I've been wandering around to find addictol to cure my alcohol addiction. Thanks for letting us know.
---
I would love to see this implemented. Having issues with a particularly hard boss? ask for help server wide. LFG? Ask server wide...etc. Yeah, there will be idiots begging for free stuff, and the like, but in all it'll be LOADS better being able to chat it up with everyone while waiting for the stupid fasnacht parade to start...
---
I love it.
---
Stay on ps4. You we are in this shit together and nobody let you escape on other servers now &gt;:D
---
In some mmo's, "exceedingly rare" does equal "near unobtainable". I kind of like it, but I also see why most people don't
---
I'm More than aware about clicking the fire to start it, I have done it myself a few times.
---
 That has no bearing on my decision to lite up the fire with my explosive handmade.
---
 It's just fun dude.
---
No problem! Sorry, forgot it was a little different on console. Took me a minute to realise too haha. 
---
Where do you get the mask?
---
Yeah noticed this too all 25%.
---
sure did
---
*Boonsfarm
---
In a server yesterday. 4 queen kills but only got loot once and 38 &amp; 10mm rounds once.
---
Not worth the ammo.
---
Oh man, same as spec ops IRL, have you ever fired a weapon CQC? At such confined spaces where you are pointing is where it will generally hit since the persons will be &lt;5M away and idk how you'd miss. If you are camping in west tek with chameleon and missing, you are just bad lol. Huge targets in close quarter and you need a sight. Thanks for the laugh!
---
Actually most of your post was whiny bullshit that's why ppl don't agree with you. The game does have it's problems but don't play it if you don't like it. Going out of your way to make this post what is even the purpose?
---
Spray it with fire from the Perfect Storm :)
---
Wrong, they care about the customers that don't cheat.
---
 Takes a real special so money to cheat on a fucken video game
---

I don‚Äôt see that the inventory management is any different than the three previous fallouts or the past two elder scrolls game. It‚Äôs abysmal, but it‚Äôs not any worse, so I can‚Äôt ding 76 for that. 
---
As far as controllers and PC, speak for yourself. I‚Äôm running a PC with an Xbox controller. I can‚Äôt stand using a mouse, and I‚Äôve yet to try my steam controller on it. 
---
I have a friend with horrible frame rate too. It‚Äôs your graphics card. I have a 1070 in my laptop and I run it on ultra settings and it‚Äôs buttery smooth. This post has pics of how far into the distance you can see.

Because you're upside down and the download is flowing backwards...
---
I made a posy in thus sub I'd love it if you put some input on it. Hoping we get a response.
---
Like I said, he was "exploiting" the fact that he couldn't be VATSed in the event area while wearing PVP gear that VATS is one of only 2 counters for, not outright cheating. And even then, I don't know why I could drop his health to nothing during the event with just aimed shots and he wouldn't go down. That's why the topic itself says "exploiting" not "cheating". Exploits take advantage of broken game mechanics, while cheating is outright messing with the game through outside means. 
---
If you have no friends. Then diluted radx 100 resist., rad shield 300 and lead champagne 100. 
---
Total 500 without armor perks
---
I fixed this by opening the change appearance option and backing out.
---
There is not much you can do other than kill first.
---
The damage equation is:
---
Damage Taken = ((Dmg/DR\*.15)\^.36)\*Dmg
---
Sentinel / Assassin reduces the first DMG by a percentage. The max being 99%. Armor Penetration reduces the DR number by a percentage and once again has a max decrease of 99%.
---
So here are a couple of examples assuming you have a DR of 400 and can reduce damage at max of 99% with sentinel assassin. Also assume that they have AA and can reduce DR by 50%.
---
Basic 200 damage shot:
---
Damage Taken = ((2/250\*.15)\^.36)\*200 = 17 damage.
---
Basic 200 damage shot but enemy has max AP:
---
Damage taken = ((2/5\*.15)\^.36)\*200 = 73 damage
---
Armor penetration helps negate sentinel assassin effects.
---
Big nasty 5000 damage crit head shot sneak attack
---
Damage taken = ((50/250\*.15)\^.36)\*5000 = 1414 damage. 
---
So the moral of today's story is that sentinel assassin armor will protect you from normal amounts of damage but will never save your life from a big bad crit to the face. This is why pvp is still a vats powered rocket tag. First person to shot / hit wins.
---
What do you recommend I do with the extra points?
---
What do you recommend I do with the other 4 points?
---
Various shades of blue
---
XD
---
I did not, is that something i need to use to activate the elevator ?
---
ha! i started taking out my sub machine pointing it just straight up and emptying the thing :)
---
Lol I don't appreciate the language sir.
---
Yeah, if they cheated to get OP gear chances are they love to grief. Our only hope for any balance is Survival Mode. I will quit the game if they don't make everyone start new there.
---
you're not wrong but the game has a lot to offer. when you get punched in the face, thats all you feel.  when you're not getting punched in the face you may notice that it is in fact a beautiful day.  All I'm saying is that were a good community with a couple bad apples.  
---
You can't ban somebody for using a nuke.  If Bethesda didn't want that to happen they would have locked Helvetia out as being a target area.
---
PC looks great, and plays pretty good depending on your set up. I use an xbox controller.
---
Someone saw it when going to trade with someone else, so that took a photo
---
Just as I thought lol
---
That looks like the Halloween Mask. There is a Halloween store in the north east part of the map where is sometimes spawns. It will also spawn in a lookout tower near the store.
---
I'm not great with adjectives.
---
I wouldn't share anything that encourages cheating. And notice I accused this person of "exploiting", not cheating. Exploiting is taking advantage of a glitch or broken game mechanic, cheating is outright messing with a game through outside means, like hacks. This guy knew that he couldn't be killed during the event, even with a bounty, and was messing with people, which is an exploit. 
---
Meanwhile, thank you for explaining why this guy wouldn't die after I downed him. Switching weapons is what I did when he died. Good to know. That will stop people from reviving my opponents after I put them down but can't finish them. That still needs a fix from Bethesda though. Much appreciated info!
---
Gay
---
This is a big fat NO. I mean I know they aren't going to do this, so it's nothing to be worried over for me. But still.
---
NO.
---
This is not even close to a priority or wanted by many
---
Did you get your owl mask yet? I have 2. 
---
Don the vampire outfit and equip Grognak‚Äôs Axe and RP has the headless horseman?
---
There is a hidden rad damage reduction baked into power armor and radiation suits which is not shown in addition to the rad resistance values that are displayed. Even if you have 1000 rad resistance it will still not be as good as a damaged radiation suit. I wish they would remove this mechanic and make rad resistance matter...
---
It sucks but with out server roll back you could REALLY lose some shit. 
---
I don‚Äôt think he was cheating. You couldn‚Äôt vats him during the event because he was ‚Äúon your team‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen this before and it‚Äôs normal behavior. 
---
I don‚Äôt think you were doing as much damage as you thought when he was down. There are perks and armor that increase your damage resistance the lower your health. I think that‚Äôs what you were seeing. 
---
I played fallout on Xbox and pc. It's better on pc. 
---
Perks ghouls and rad sponge and team up with someone. Almost invincible. 
---
I see that, could you edit it? Maybe try to be a bit more polite. 
---
Also, people make mistakes and give in to urges especially when in the beginning the duping method gave every legit player a hugely unfair advantage. So I personally think people deserve a second chance but hey you're entitled yo your own opinion, glad you could share it.
---
Oh that's pretty impressive. I just got to work so I probably won't look through it in much depth for a while.
---
I started putting together a list the other day. Not far along, but I can confirm most of the fallout wiki numbers are right. Exceptions so far include a bunch of the heavy weapons, and laser weapons due to the recent patch not being reflected there. And for melee numbers I'm getting raw numbers for STR = 0 so I can hopefully have a completely accurate formula for that damage and all the right modifiers in the right places.
---
My eventual goal is a full damage calculation tool. Select type, put in base damage and maybe a few other values to get a list of damage with different perk combos up to "theoretical max" with various legendary combinations and so on. Then hopefully an accurate "in-game" effective damage vs some enemies.
---
Anyways I'm happy to collaborate as much as I can! Thanks a ton you gave me a lot to work with.
---
I think the opposite. Kill all but 1. And maybe try multiple times. IF the rng has something to do with robots at the end, maybe certain robots have a high percentage of rewarding the common masks, when you remove the others it makes the chance higher of the robot that has survived, but it is still low. So say it goes from 0.5% chance, to 5-10%
---
PVP is so annoying. I rolled into Helvetia to start the festival and began clearing out some buildings. from down the road I see three 100+ Lvl players chasing each other bouncing off the walls rapid firing at each other.
---
I try to slip back out of sight, but they knew i was there. they tagged me a couple times. I jump up and run off into the woods. halfway to the plane crash and their still after me. so I force- power down the console and go make dinner.
---
Im not wasting my resources on that.
---
No idea. This character isn‚Äôt mine. :)
---
Used to do this with Counterstrike when it first came out
---
Thanks, I'll go and look for it
---
Very likely not fixable with the current game engine. 
---
I only got to shoot it 2 times out of 5 times trying the event. Even after asking people not to one shot it they do it anyway. As if we are suppose to be so amazed afterwards. Not me. I told them you are all assholes and no one gives a shit if you can one shot the sloth. The gear it drops is totally useless to the high levels but not for me. 
---
Dunno about perks but Tomahawks will probably help, there. More dmg a hit. 
---
You can‚Äôt do much about it. The best part of most of the anti armor perks and item stats is that they use percentages. I believe you can get up to 90% anti armor. It almost doesn‚Äôt matter if you have 1000 or 2000 DR at that point. 
---
Assassins/sentinel is going to mitigate damage taken. They are still going to out DPS someone without anti-armor. 
---
A sneak sniper can get 4-5x damage modifiers. Even of you mitigate 90% of that they can still do 40-80 damage or more per hit that goes unmitigated. 
---
I have both a pvp melee and a pvp sneak sniper. The sneak sniper can one shot players even in pvp gear. 
---
Thanks everyone for the responses. It did eventually appear like about 20 minutes later... I just dont know why it took that long but it did show up that's the important thing haha.
---
But agian thanks for the options!! This community is awesome!! 
---
You are pretty goofy!
---
its not a dick move. Its a video game.
---
So was I
---
Nothing you said in particular - I tend to fully justify my reasoning for (any given) question - thus the analysis.    Figure that way, no misunderstanding what I mean.
---
Flaw behind my though process was not knowing Beth. had already said (unspecified) masks will be rare.
---
I would assume that it would be buffed by Big Guns since it is a heavy weapon for damage perks. Though I have actually never found an energy weapons bobblehead in 400 hours. :-:
---
My guess would be that they are simply re-banning all previously banned accounts until they have time to sort it out.
---
Been just using my 10mm during the parade instead of my TSE shotgun, everything is fine until the sloth shows up. People delete it so quickly I can hardly ever tag it.
---
Whitesprings would be perfect. Should be a free fast travel point, with mission boards, and places for player vending. Already has tons of npc vendors, stashes and crafting station.
---
Man now I really want to kill an Evil Leprechaun and get me a shiny Pot-O-Caps
---
Generally speaking, as long as you have a good setup, you're gonna be getting at least double the FPS on PC vs XBOX, dont know for sure that that holds true with PS4, but I suspect it will. 
---
I know, I'm doing it because it's fun to pretend I can start fires in FO76.
---
You dont need to be at max dmg for the parade event. 
---
Play smart. We are allowed to kill you. 
---
Lost a plan for the stove last night.  I'd been trying to close the application before shutting down the console, but that doesn't seem to help.  Also lost progress on a few quests.
---
This. 
---
It showed up last night for some people.  They were showing screenshots of it in the Atom Shop.  But I did not see it.
---
Made me wonder if it was tied to Time Zone, and the people saying it were ahead of me?
---
&gt; So I decided to support Bethesda by purchasing some atoms, good job on the new content! 
---
this could be bethesdas new strategy
---
release buggy broken mess of a game, and any semi-decent content afterwards you release will feel awesome to the existing player base to the point of them voluntarily giving you money (on top of what you've already paid for the base game) even tho the base game is still shit
---
Edited per request. 
---
I watched videos on duping, read posts and watched others do it. That being said I never had even the slightest "urge" to cheat.
---
I reported every post, player and video I saw. 
---
Dupers, including you, knew what they (you) were doing was wrong. It was done anyway. I am sorry, I have no sympathy for cheaters. 
---
If you are strick roleplaying you are limited to event rewards, lunch pails, and level 3 safes. If you want to be an enterprising raider you could possibly cut a deal with someone to sell you them.
---
Confirmed last night that it was randomly available from both of the Watoga Vendors, on Xbox at least.
---
Yeah they said on stream yesterday it would be coming to the atom store for everybody today. 
---
Hah! Yeah that's true as hell. 
---
Could basically just do what New Vegas did and call it something like "Combat Armor, Reinforced" or "Advanced Combat Armor"  
---
I'm level 185 and those things follow me around the map!
---
Hot Granny Tip: use the BoS AA guns to help you in the Bog
---
The same happened to me just power off your device it should showing it after closing and opening the game
---
No one cares, we're Americans
---
You are probably wanting a Pip-Boy/Marketplace app for your phone. Which would be nice
---
It happens when you disconnect before the game saves and updates your character data.
---
It can work to your benefit (rarely).  My teammate had just crafted their Shielded BOS Underarmor a few days back.  And then accidentally scrapped it.  He was upset.  Then the server crashed and he disconnected a short time later.  He logged back in and his Shielded BOS Underarmor was back.  He lost a few things he had collected since, but was more than happy to exchange those for the return of his underarmor.
---
I agree met a few hilarious people and made a couple of friends out of it.  
---
I placed my camp the 'Church of the Great Dong' atop the hill overlooking Helvatia for refuge for all ye bored and inquisitive  and have been flooded with all kinds of pilgrims looking to pay tribute to the great dong or just use a work bench and talk smack well we wait out the event timer was far more fun than endlessly server hopping.  
---
I have the same issue, just mentioning to push
---
Are you sure it's AA? I can VATS crit kill through Assassin's Sentinel or Assassin's Cavalier in one to two magazines on my 3\* Furious combat rifle. The key is I'm hitting you with crits every couple shots and my follow up hits are the ones doing damage. If the person spams stimpacks it might drag on into the 2nd magazine but never any more. If I can't VATS you I switch to an AA handmade and it takes longer and exposes my position more. However, for you not to be VATS'd, you need to either crouch which negates the Sentinel effect, or use stealthboys.
---
Have you tried damage mitigation perks? Dodgy, Blocker and Serendipity are all fantastic though the last is build dependent. If you can block more than just the Assassin's 40% you stand a chance of recovering and being able to quickly stim. I'd also suggest working in a team where you tank and the others clean up. That way you don't have 1 or more people unloading on you non-stop. When I'm being tag-teamed it's a lot harder to get off a full magazine on one target without moving.
---
I also have a level 90 alt that acquired a full set of Assassin's Sentinel in the past few days. Other than from my own sheer stupidity, no one has killed me this week because I think most people don't understand how it works. I sat last night at the ammo factory for a good 20 minutes planted on top of an APC with a 20 cap bounty and let my level 59 bloodied melee buddy clean up while I tanked. I actually messaged one person to stagger me then follow up with damage quickly and he came back with... a dragon.
---
As for the stupidity I mentioned, shooting an explosive weapon point blank into a bloodied melee's face is a bad idea. I staggered myself 3 times and was one shot each of those before I figured out what was going on. I was barely taking any damage either. All three times his Serendipity kicked in and mitigated all my shotgun damage.
---
Well, you can just use letters or lightboxes to create that guild/clan logo/insingia.
---
Thanks! Also unitymedia vom Germany? 
---
That‚Äôs how they pronounce it in Helvetia, West Virginia as well
---
It's not playing favorites. Those games were never ported to consoles, they're several console generations past when they were published, and the source code would need to be completely reworked for them to play on a current console. It would take way too much work to get them to run properly on a PS4 or Xbox. It's pretty silly to think they could just be easily ported over to run on current hardware. 
---
Just close out the game and reopen it, that made it show up for me.
---
Thank you professor, appreciated. 
---
Oh no. I meant what are you using to play the game? Xbox? PS4? And a support ticket to Bethesda. Did you get on their website and try to contact them?
---
Actually a lot of people do agree. You just need to look beyond the white knights of this toxic sub reddit to realise this has taken a beating. A lot of people were looking forward to this and a lot of people were disappointed.
---
You even agree yourself it has its problems but for some reason its not okay to criticise them? How are improvements supposed to get made when there a folks like you.
---
Bloodied - you won't look back :)
---
The more you damage it the slower it moves.  I run a melee build with just a couple gunslinger perks. It takes a little while to chip it down with my revolver but once its health is about 1/3 I get it down quick.
---
Oh man sorry i just woke up lol. I‚Äôm on Xbox, and no i haven‚Äôt. I‚Äôll try to after work today. 
---
New PvP event for the control of the color
---
Never accused the guy of outright cheating. It says "Exploiting" in the title. He was definitely abusing the No-VATS event area to mess with people, but not outright cheating. And I know all about the armor and low-health stuff. Why I couldn't manually down him during the event without VATS even after completely depleting his health I think is either a bug or an anti-griefing feature for the event like the inability to target other players in VATS during the event. As far as the not dying after he was downed at the end of the event, I believe Zilochius answered that and I edited the post to reflect that. :)
---
As a Level 145 even i cant manage to tag the mobs due to other high level players.
---
Can we not make every thread about this please.  
---
Apparently the more robots, the higher chance of getting a mask.  But what if the rarity of the mask works the opposite?  Lower the robots, decrease the chance of getting a mask, but increase the odds of that mask being one of the rare ones rather than just the 5 standard masks.
---
I have cleared it with two of the five robots alive a few things (mutant suicide bombers coming from the bridge instead of the bar, church, or school take us by surprise).  First time it happened I got the Beret.  Second time a standard mask.  So none of the rare masks, though I know two data points do not make much of a sample.
---
As others have said. Leave the play session and hop back in. I just server hopped and did a sneak attack on a Whitesprings ghoul to complete it. 
---
Super annoying, but at least there's a fairly simple fix. 
---
What platform are you running on.  I have an extra Bird Bones I can part with.
---
I love Fasnacht. It's sort of silly, but great fun. I've done it once with about 15 other players present (no lag whatsoever). Can't wait to go again.
---
Unusual, considering the moment this event starts everyone is on a passive mode regardless..
---
Have you seen the spread of that second shot?  Might as well be tallied damaged the same as one shot.  It‚Äôs good only for big targets and mobs imo.
---
*Other players are dedicated to PvP and Im not competetive in my PvE armor* 
---
Lol. You gotta work for it. Then let us know if you think it's balanced. Of course it doesn't seem balanced to you, you are under geared.
---
I want to say diseases last longer with the mutation which would make perfect sense. Basically you have to deal with dysentery and rad worms for a longer period. 
---
my issue with playing (any game) on (any) computer system vs console is the time it takes to complete vs any give update breaking the game.  
---
With only limited time to play, it can take me a very long time (months) to finish a game.  Last couple games I had on my computer, after a couple of OS updates/security patches, the games broke.  
---
Contact support, their answer was more or less "we wrote the game for OS version X.y, you are on OS version X.z, adn we dont support that, so if you want to continue playing \*downgrade your OS\*
---
Um...no.
---
So at that point, could no longer play the game(s), wasted money and all that.
---
After I got my first console, guess what?  No longer had that problem.  
---
THrough umpteen firmware and OS updates on the console(s), literally a year to complete a game (as it happens, one of the earlier fallouts), game(s) continued to  work without issue.  
---
I wouldn't even think about buying a PC base version of any game now.
---
u/ladydevann u/valseek
---
Ok.  That's what I figured could also cause it not to show up for me.  But I was busy with the events and didn't wanna close my game.  Good to know it'll show up tonight when I get on.
---
try restarting your game/console? i saw it available last night as well.
---
I came to be the negative Nancy. You are exactly the consumer that makes publishers like Bethesda drip feed lacking content. Game has been out for four months and no end game changes or actual good loot from scorchbeats/queens. Yet an event that is new ‚Äú obviously the low population will flock to since there is nothing else exciting to do anymore‚Äù makes you happy that there‚Äôs something to do again ( give it a few weeks and this will be just as dead as every other event in Fo76) and you reward them with money. When you drop the game yet again and come back for more drip feed are you then going to reward them with money for a game that is still in a full priced Beta phase with MTX‚Äôs? I expect downvoted because I seem to be the only one who isn‚Äôt a part of this one event circle jerk.
---
&gt;its not okay to criticise 
---
you? 
---
With rare legendary loot at the end of the rainbow!
---
...we have to fight the leprechaun boss first.
---
I, too, have seen the decline.  I think new content is only part of the issue.  I think o e of the bivgest issues is the buff od the SBQ.   I dont run a tuned build.  However, when i launche d my first nuke, the queen was difficulrt but doable.  Now, i burn through over 3000 rounds of ammo and break all my guns just trying to kill the queen.  Im level 72.   I have 3 tse weapons and a 3* melee weapon.   I barely do any damage.   
---
I think the reward is too low for the high time and resource expenditure.  Thats my take on it.  And im just a casual player.  I play when i can.  Love the game, but only have about 200 hrs in it.
---
I'm sure it anti armor but I haven't got serendipity equipped so I think I'll give that a try, thx for that üòâ
---
Thanks, I did five server hops with negative results, then I got sucked into the Fasnacht parade, I‚Äôll try again over the weekend
---
My uncle who works at Bethesda says...
---
Thank you.
---
Just remember Serendipity is for bloodied builds so it only proc's at low health. I don't actually use it but you will occasionally hear me swear about it on party chat. :)
---
Yes through the stores menu

---
You have to use melee or it doesn't count.
---
Or, and this is crazy, but it could just be that Bethesda created an event that caters to what the community wants? It's an event with variables and it changes up slightly every time you run it. It offers a wide variety of loot and rewards that are at least somewhat interesting (compared to every other event in game). It's fun, the theme is fresh, and it's interesting to do.
---
If every event in Fallout 76 were this good the game's reception would have been night and day.
---
It's at least a good sign to come if this is the kind of events they're planning on integrating moving forward. Most of us are tired of the completely uninspired loot drops and want this kind of content.
---
This is the best part and (every time I manage to remember in time) I chant over mic 
---
Perfect.  Thanks!
---
Becauze they do t realise you can travel away from the area, kill squirrels and stuff to get the intesti es then come back and deposit them to get it going
---
This is the best way
---
Simply equip more than one of the same type of mask (it will allow you to equip 2 of the same masks for certain types) then unequip it. Seems to work every time for me when using owls masks to get an invisible head.
---
Today I realized that there are at least three possible places where the sloth can show up. During my last event, it got killed before even the green legendary spawning effect could complete.
---
Unless the rainbow is coming out of a unicorn's (or perhaps a deathclaw's) arse, we don't need no rainbows. Mwahahahaha
---
Is this with targeting the turrets with a melee weapon? I did this on accident on my first nuke run and went into the ceiling. I was very confused and just tried to get back into a room without falling through the map and dying. Ended up in the final room except no lights turned on so it was an annoying fight. 
---
Yeah, they're from the dev room.
---
I love these weird little details Bethesda does. Like the lead in the kids toys.
---
Have had 3 run throughs so far, but one of them I was completely on my own for and the overall experience was a lot less fun (I failed it as ran out of time collecting intestines as not enough animals spawned). 
---
For me, joining forces with your fellow brothers and sisters of Appalachia to fight for a common cause really makes this event! (‚Ä¶and the awesome masks, of course!)
---
Its the foul mouthed toxic PvE players  breaking immersion with their emotional rants, cursing off raiders when i kill them. 
---
Fine, we will stop trying to educate the reddit community about how we raid. We were trying to help people who dont wanna get raided avoid us. 
---
From now on i will start reporting salty foul mouthed pve players when they curse me off in game. 
---
You dont have to like us. You do have to be civil.
---
If it was flying directly away &amp; not hovering &amp; doing circles it was just glitched. The first time I tried it this happened &amp; I ended up chasing it from the savage divide all the way to the forest. I kept thinking who has the Endurance or AP to do this? But thankfully after reloading the game it behaved normally &amp; I got my card.
---
Yeah but [it's so worth it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMasIHupafo)
---
Performance is vastly better on PC, it'll feel much better to play. But use a gamepad to play, the PC controls are funky.
---
I didn't see that one, but I saw some blue mask, with a missile sticking out of one of the eyes.. weird!

In a post apocalyptic world we are running around taking pictures and wearing goofy outfits. The original Fallout franchise has come so far... thanks for proving my point.
---
Just a thought and if it has been mentioned already I apologize.  What about the robot that asks you to decorate and gives you the choices for each.  Afterwards he grades your efforts.  Has anyone tried different combinations to see if that has any effect on rare drop chances?  My grades both times were abysmal.  Not sure if any combo provides this lousy grade.
---
THeres another perk card to reduce rad intake (not rad sponge) by a double digit percentage - I just noticed/acquired/equipped it in the last couple days (I've gained 5 levels in the last week, so I'm not sure when this card actually appeared.)
---
Anyhow, it seems to help a bit.  
---
And I carry lots of rad-x/radaway.
---
Or you can hope for the glitch I experienced last night - not teamed, roaming WS nuke zone for about an hour - killed a number of critters...took no rads.  
---
Not even a twitch from the geiger counter.
---
Just a heads up. Mountainside Bed and Breakfast almost always spawns a Chainsaw in the basement. 
---
Apparently player vending is coming out April 9th as per of the Wild Appalachia update
---
I really don't think he was exploiting either.  It's a valid game mechanic and since it's a defensive mechanic, it isn't even all that objectionable.  I used to run with auto-stim armor which auto-revived me when I went down.  Is that an exploit?  Definitely not.
---
And from your post, it appears that the only "messing around" he was doing at the event was having a bounty, not being killed by you and making sarcastic comments when you attacked him.
---
I think that falls under the "playing the game well" category more than the "exploit" category, sorry.  And you won in the end, so what's your complaint?
---
Unless you play *very* old games on PC, this shouldn't be an issue. Newer games may run bad on older OS but not the other way round. Especially with the arrival of Windows 10, this will likely not be an issue for years to come.
---
I love it... great interior design. Always appreciate builders that can make the interior look really live-able.
---
I don't know how people play this game without power armour.  
---
I thought power armour was going to be this really special things where you saved it for those big raids when you've managed to farm enough to craft it and get the power cores.
---
Turns out power armour is everywhere and so are power cores so you can literally roam around in it the entire time you play.
---
*slow clap* *slow clap* * slow clap* 
---
r/PunPatrol ! Stop right there, dirtbag!
---
Now with only 86% Radiation!
---
Is this true?
---
Many thanks. Is it based around Vending Machines though? 
---
Auction house is also a gateway to a bunch of tradepost barons who spend all days all night camping the trade and scooping up potentially rare stuffs, resell at exorbitant price and pretty much place the entire game's economy in a few no-lifers' hands. 
---
ESO did away with this and thank god it was one of the best things to happen in mmorpg. 
---
Alright bender chill
---
Not much you can do, nor should there be.  No build should be invincible to everything all that time, 
---
You can get it if all robots survive too. It doesn't matter. 
---
So there are a few things here.
---
First, during the parade, the SBQ event, and probably with some more events, players are all put into "superteam". You couldn't shoot the guy because he was on your team.
---
What that player did was to enter the parade while having a bounty to either finish the parade and get a mask, or to troll some of his new teammates to waste ammo. No exploits in here.
---
Then, I suppose that being unable to be shoot while downed is a lag/bug and not an exploit, but I haven't seen it myself and cannot be sure. The rule of thumb so far is that 99.9% of 'exploiters' are not actually exploiting and the game is so complicated and unreliable that its assumed they are. The first person to actually gather full assassin sentinel has raised multiple "wtf cheater posts". Met the guy actually, he was a really friendly person, and when we later played some Apex Legends he was absolutely carrying my ass to championship with like 60% win ratio in that playsession. But I digress.
---
Finally, there is a neat little trick regarding downing enemies and I am pretty sure it would give you a nice feeling of accomplishment if you knew it and used it. Downed an enemy and got a few seconds to play with him? Equip cannibal perk. Eat him. Having this perk equipped allows you to perform 'execute' action on downed player which literally eats them alive.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-our-roadmaps FO76 roadmap
---
I believe so, in their roadmap thing it says ‚ÄúBuild vending machines for your C.A.M.P.‚Äù
---
While you do t have AA, I bet you still have armor pen. Tank killer? Perforating magazine? Those in combination give you more than 50% armor pen. Those plus AA give you the max 99%.
---
I‚Äôm talking about using your power armor to wall breach and then walk outside of the map and get to the final room, so kind of similar. 
---
I run underarmor and outfits instead of armor/PA. I just wanna look cute and show off my Clean outfits/masks. 
---
If it's a legendary enemy, sure. If not, I won't intentionally take longer to go through an area/dungeon.
---
The first mission gives you the healing and cure plans. 
---
Right now there is no glitch for PvP.
---
But I've run some tests with my friend, the damage that you think you are doing to another player it's not always accurate.
---
Sometimes the game shows the health bar of your opponent almost empty, when you are doing a lot less damage then you think.
---
Maybe the game needs some time to process the damage going through perk cards, armors and mods to send the information back to the enemy.
---
In my experience there were a lot more jerks on PS4 compared to PC. 
---
Played PS4 a while ago though.
---
As for hunting rifle my advice is to kill super mutants at the prison they tend to have them and scrapping them got me all the plans. 
---
My favorite part is changing burn him! into the area mic. 
---
Technically you don't need power armor you only need a Hazmat suit, (you can find them at lower levels) 
---
You'd be low on DR though so I'd recommend Med-X or Pscyhotats.
---
I've got 3 berets. Not to hard to get
---
OP is a grotesquely inane buzzkill.
---
Im pretty sure i read on here that data miners have found an upcoming event similar, to do with the polling booths
---
Pffft next you're going to tell me shooting every balloon is childish
---
It would be funny if the only reason it‚Äôs rarer is bots aren‚Äôt dying. üòÇ
---
Ah, gotcha. Well my method may still work, but it's glitchy to say the least and not hard to run through a silo anyway. 
---
To me personally, the original combat armor looked like some pads American football or hockey players might wear, not armor a soldier would wear into combat. Not a fan, but that's just me.
---
Switch weapons while invisible, and switch back.
---
All I know is first time I got it I had like, 2 dead robots, and haven't gotten it since with all robots alive
---
I find it strange and wonder what someone wants when the just start shooting or hitting you.  Last night as I ran down from the railroad station in Whitesprings to the bunker someone just started unloading their automatic rifle on me.  I just continued on my way but they continued following me all the way into the bunker.  I'm in pacifist mode and haven't the time to deal with the pvp parts.  It's way to slow to turn off the pacifist mode on PS4 so I don't even go there.  Don't wanna PVP refuse to PVP just a waste of supplies and time in my opinion. Luckily I didn't have to server jump as it seems the individual wasn't able to enter the bunker or just didn't care to.  Anyway, different strokes for different folks I guess.  Wonder about the thought process sometimes though. 
---
from how many events?
---
Lvl 2, as your level 2 when you level the vault. All plans given to you from another character can be learned at lvl 2.
---
Well if you see the event heart of the swamp run to dyer chemicals and grab all the strangler pods and make rad shield. Gives you 300+ rad resistance and I *think* stacks with rad x.

---
I switch out some of the perks situationally, including changing to riflemen occasionally. I spam crits every couple shots with commando and tear through pretty much everything. I have a level 90 melee alt that can do a lot of damage but it's no where near as good as this one in PVP.
---
I have never had an issue with eating food myself, but slow loading times are very real. I get in after the loading screen and then have to wait another 2 minutes for the world to update itself. I won't be able to fast travel to my camp during this process because clicking on it provides no options.
---
sure no problem i can play on thursday
---
The fact that you were put in a team is a feature of the event that worked correctly and according to expectations. The fact that this player used correctly working feature to participate in the event is by no means cheating. Think of it this way, if that player could be shoot during the event, he either could shoot people back, or he'd be in absolutely unfair situation when he can be shoot but cannot be shoot back. If he could shood back when attacked, he could purposefully place himself between the players and the monsters to get shoot and to be able to retaliate mid-event. Any other game design decision for the PvP conditions during these events would mean they often become PvP rampages. If you want your PvE events to be griefing-free, the situation where you can't shoot a wanted player mid-event is the best possible one.
---
No one knows, but possibly. Nuclear Winter will also be staggered, so it will need time. I don't think they are far enough along finalizing the product to give out a date, but I suspect it may be right after E3, which is in early June.
---
There is perk, that heals your rad damage over daytime. Now i am so rich i don't care about rads and also i have adrenal reaction so much rads = bigger damage. Leaved PA really long ago, using hazmat only for nuke zone.
---
Morning citizen. Hope your time in the Fallout community has gone well so far.
---
I'm Sentinel Bailey of the Appalachia Brotherhood of Steel (An Xbox Discord group with over 50 members) we're always looking for potential new recuirts, so if you think you got what it takes to protect your fellow man/restore order in Appalachia/defeat our foes (Hostile Enclave groups/Raiders etc) let me know and I shall send up a link. Hope to see you out in the field. Ad Victoriam! -Sentinel K. Bailey - Sentinel SN-004-KB - Appalachia Brotherhood of Steel - Dagger Squad.
---
That's my assumption. Because first time I got it's, 3 survived, haven't gotten it since with all surviving
---
maybe? Its been a while since ive dicked around with the settings ;-;
---
It isn't. Someone datamined the game yesterday and found that there is likely a faulty logic that causes some of the masks to never drop.
---
Ah I gotcha, gotta try that bc I really want that beret lol
---
It happens if you have two of any one of the masks or beret apparently (I heard any headgear from someone else) and switch between which one is equip a few times. 
---
You can undo the effect by putting on a mask you only have one of and taking it off again. Or by getting into and out of power armor 
---
In one of the earlier times of the event someone was nice enough to give me a flamer, so I could join in on the burning, it was a group moment of happiness.
---
These legendary effects are not a flat percentage decrease in damage taken. They modify the ratio of damage to Dr that then modifies the actual damage. The more damage done, the less effective these effects are. In my example a 200 damage shot is reduced by 92% while a 5000 damage shot is reduced by 72%. This is why you can still 1 shot a player with full sentinel assassin armor.
---
I keep extra intestines and eggs on my player the only major drawback to Helvatica being nuked is no small critters will spawn. I also like to get all the prerequisites done as quick as possible.
---
Props for bot posting with 'bethesda please!"
---
Is anyone else‚Äôs badge on the beret warped and weird?
---
Seems to me like they are aiming for quarterly releases. So June / July might be the earliest part of the next DLC.

"*Why DOnT ThEY fIX Da BuGS inSTEad*?!"

I do have max Tank Killer and use a Stinging magazine. It's less armor pen than Perforating but more rounds mean more crits. I have multiple AA weapons including AAE I just find the combat rifle superior in VATS to the rest as it's AP cost is lower.

This is my build:

---
This bug is activated by crouching for some reason when you crouch too much, you became imune to nuke zone raddamage.
---
I'll have to check tonight. I was focusing more on my missing head.
---
I've never had to much junk and don't know anyone that does. All my point is is that if you can craft ammo but find it in abundance, why can't you craft components.
---
Use VATS ... or lern how to aim.
---
25% is useless. 
---
Admittedly, it'd be cooler if it were you have to actually use fire.
---
I don't get it, since most of the time the place is full of lvl 100 players, killing everything instantly. Hence new players can't even tag mobs.. 
---
Thanks I'll try this. 
---
This post is 3 months old, what brings you back here?
---
I got it on my first try. All of the bots survived. 
---
Telekom, no issues
---
I live in my PA and face a chemical shower at my base so I don't worry much about rads. Just drop into my camp, rinse off and get back to whatever I was doing.
---
Thanks for that wonderful advice, I'd have never come to that conclusion on my own or tried that already. Truly a brilliant mind, you have.
---
I just recently swapped over to not using PA and running around in my manta man suit and one of my random helmets, the option to use a power fist or deathclaw gauntlet is amazing. I quickly realized how squishy I am and how many rads I take so I had to swap my perks around quite a bit and now I'm awful with guns. 
---
If something is running at me my pc is too squishy to not shoot to kill.  I don't do power armour.
---
In nuke zones my weapon won't 1 hit kill anything so I sit on a roof taking pot shots at the bloated glowing whatevers and hope to get something nice.
---
Click to activate. I click the button. A Molotov flies out of my characters hand. A fire ensues. Good ole Appalachia fun.
---
Either there's a good Samaritan out there or the bunker is kinda bugged. Was heading to the bunker to discover it (to make it easier for fast travel when I need it) to find that the door was already unlocked but still closed. Simply opened the door, walked in, picked up the plans and walked out. No hassle. Worth checking out to save searching for keys/cards.
---
I couldnt agree more, a few nights ago I lost one of my favorite rifles this way or it was to the item bug? Not sure but I am still pissed about it. Please add a lock so we cant accidentally get rid of our valuable items!
---
Hm. Maybe it was just a glitch. I suppose it can't hurt to try again.
---
Thanks! Yeah a friend of mine uses Deutsche Telekom as well and he doesn‚Äôt have issues either. Seems to be unitymedia related. 
---
What‚Äôs it look like?
---
It also counters the speed demon debuff 
---
Wow good job
---
Because Valley Galleria already has that.
---
I run big mutant build so anything other than diluted I don't really mess with, I did the original heart of the swamp and made rad shield once but does it suppress mutations? 
---
May i be able to join to?
---
The original Fallouts also died with Interplay. Bethesda came in and resurrected the franchise, and yeah, they took things into a bit more whimsical side of things... but at the same time those elements have always been in the original games, too.
---
Look at the first Fallout. Vault 13 gets a single water chip, Vault 8 gets literal hundreds. In the Fallout 2 instead of going against the Enclave you can also become a fluffer or a porn star. Or blow up an outhouse full of shit and paint the town. There's always been incredibly ridiculous elements to these games. Are you saying somehow taking pictures and wearing silly costumes is any better/worse than choosing to become a porn star in a post-apocalyptic game?
---
I have that perk that reduces rads during the day(?) along with the healing mutation and the healing perk. Only use PA to fast travel when overloaded or for big fights. Have a rad shower in my camp too. Rads are not an issue.
---
I found that in the B.E.T.A. but now recently it dawned because of the trailer and everything. And the robot at the billings farm. (there is my home camp btw.
---
I constantly struggle with caps mostly because there's nothing that has really caught my attention other than PA mods and ultracite or prime stuff that you can't buy. 
---
I think you have to go near the quest givers and then once completed it resets in 24 hours 
---
Unless you have a mutation that auto-triggers like electrically charged.  For some reason the mutations will fire and put you into pvp mode even if you are in pacifist mode.  I know its happened to me just standing at a vendor trading and having someone just start clubing me  do basically little damage only to have the mutation fire and then getting one shotted.  It happens, shouldn't with Pacifist mode enabled but it does.  So yea there's that.
---
And yet you keep complaining. You only need to disable the Thrusters so its stops, with a Hunting rifle and VATS this is a easy Task.
---
you already can with some degree using the blueprinting system
---
Had the freezing one or two times while trying to eat. Occurred only after the patch
---
I have scrapped quite a few Pole Hooks and not learned any mods for them, this seems to be the case for a few weapons in the game.
---
It's a game glitch.  They didn't really transfer.  After you re-log it'll be back to normal.
---
I think my game plan is the rad shower. I have to point out that I haven't really done any quests, most of my time playing the game has been farming legendary weapons and events. I still pull out my PA for big fights and I have alot of perks unlocked so I'll have to mess around with that and see if I have the perk you are talking about. I have healing factor and I cook alot of food and drinks so I never really use stimpacks. 
---
The list is either incomplete or these item names are incorrect.
---
I have Napoleon mask, Merman mask and second main mask which are not on the list
---
Oh, yeah, sure, easy as a sunday stroll. It just sits there within VATS distance and lets you kill it. Easiest thing ever. Silly me, I didn't realize it was so close and easy to shoot. I coulda sworn it moved. Must've been a trick of the light. Thanks for clearing it up!
---
Remove barbarian to max out the slugger perks
---
Remove refractor and put in adamantium skeleton
---
Would be tight if there was a Raider Event like this one but instead we would all get together to fuck up a horde of super mutants or mole miners at the top of the world 
---
Thinking about setting up my camp next to whitesprings or the bos places to get easy rad shower for now until I buy one. I run portable camp so rad shower is probably the best option. 
---
PvP is actually pretty balanced for the most part, seeing as people in sent/assassin's sets can't do anything outside of Stealth Boy'ing to prevent headshots (which btw, yes headshots drop anyone and their mother.) Now, if things were to work as intended, setting someone on fire should allow you to VATS them, but that doesn't really work atm. I'm willing to explain on why things are balanced if anyone has any questions.
---
Since the March 13th update, No daily quests have been triggering for me at all. I go Camden Park everyday in hopes the daily would trigger, but it does not. None of the other daily quests trigger for me either. Its a bummer. 
---
Crafting 5 fuel still costs 10 acid, 5 oil, and 2 steel and you're asking for fucking rainbows?
---
Also look into dodgy. As long as you have AP you can mitigate more damage.
---
Imagine being at the core of it and like a Pot of Gold there is just the Ultrazit ore.   
---
Aaaaand maybe a scourgebeast or two. And don't forget the high radiation in that area that is temorary. And could happen anywhere.  
---
The science behind hat one could be beta rays that can be influenced by the sun. The shimmering effect of mostly sick looking radiation colours like purple, blue, green and yellow without or with very little red would look stunning.  
---
You get all these plans pretty early on. I've got a level 11 character and have only done the first few responder quests in Flatwoods and got the first 2 overseers tapes. I seem to recall getting the hunting rifle plans as a reward for something, although I cant recall what it was.
---
Same with the salves you get these early on too.
---
Did you sleep for three hours? 
---
How you solve hunger and thirs over 9hours period of afk time? Also how the hell you can stay on same server for so long without DC ? :D
---
I play without PA, just hit level 100. My trick was to take Pharma farma at start. One rank provides more then enough chems to heal and sell, and a quick trip through the Whitespring restocks legendaries and chems because of all the bathroom sink mirrors.
---
Yellow checker, little shield  on front, if you saw the pics for a generals uniform that unreleased for now, it's the same model as that.
---
And maybe remove lead belly and put in serendipity in the luck section
---
Well u guess his perception must be 0
---
I did about 7 events yesterday and got 2, one of them from the day before.  
---
Full disclosure is that I don't have any of the harder to get ones, just 2 or 3 of soldier, giant, toothy, witches, beret, owl masks.  I server hop to my friends list and it's a 50/50 the event is already under way.  
---
You can still get it if no robots die. I got mine and we never lost a single bot.
---
Yes, but then you can shut them down. 
---
Awesome sounds good :D send it over and I shall be on after work !
---
RIGHT! Every online game that has a player hub trading, where you have static, persistent marketplace, always has a high number of people that just do that. Buy up all of the stuff, then resell it even higher. 
---
Or prices for certain items become fixed.
---
This would be bad for a game like FO76 because it's trying to do something different. 
---
I believe it does since it just says rifles and not ballistic rifles
---
I use a Grog Axe and a TSE Gatling. Still squishy, but I can usually kill a group before they kill me, except lvl 52 Mr. Gusty's. Those armor piercing rounds just melt me.
---
It does :( just confirmed guess I'll sell this now lol. 
---
It‚Äôs sun kissed for rads and photosynthetic for health regen..I have one point in each and hardly ever have rads for long now - both in Endurance
---
Odd. My head doesn't disappear when I put on the Beret
---
The game hands out stimpacks, purified waters, and radaway like candies from doing workshop defence events.
---
About 5 hrs but a couple of those quests popped up as failed
---
Ah fair enough
---
A Missile launcher with targeting mod works well. Though it can be a PIA to find/learn the plan/mod for it. Easiest way I found is to kill Mole Miners in Welch you almost always get one or two missile launchers then scrap the Missile Launchers and you'll eventually learn the mod.
---
The other way is through random quest/event rewards. One of us, heart of the swamp, always vigilant, irrational fear, it's a trap, queen of the hunt, idle explosives, waste not, and play time can spawn the reward according to the Fallout 76 Wiki.
---
Interesting i have more than 7 of owl masks but 0berets. Funny thing is i find out those mask ugly and childish but that beret is just coool.
---
Must try this.
---
I'm sure I have 2 owl masks lol
---
Don‚Äôt do it, steer well clear, you cannot milk a Brahmin easily with it because for some reason even if your clear of disease Brahmin will aggro and run off, also the extra damage plague walker gives you is weak, it‚Äôs enough to mess up an instigating build but only damaging enough to kill things like the vendor bot who you really don‚Äôt want keeling over when your trying to buy that elusive hunters long coat. I cleared the mutation a week or so ago and life has been much easier since
---
Hmm?  That's the same exact video I posted, queued almost to the same exact second.  
---
Maybe I'm just lucky are you on PS4?
---
Platform? 
---
Aaaah yes, seen a few people wearing that, thanks. Not sure I‚Äôm bothered tbh. I like the witches one the best so far, just makes me look like I‚Äôm wearing a hoody.
---
Chicken is also small animal! Don't be racist!
---
Yea, its hard to move your character in range. /s
---
Im not going further with this discussion, you clearly are to stupid to use the help you have been given.
---
Donate 20 rad toad eggs is the baker's quest.
---
I play on PC,  but it would depend on your Pc specs.
---
 For example I have a 1070ti and an i7 6700 with 16bg of ram. . Far from todays top of the line, and I can run 2 instances of the game at full res (great for trading with my mule account)
---
Then I have my work laptop with a first gen i5 and 8gb of ram and the game barely plays. 
---
I can't speak on the ps4 community,  but overall I feel the PC community  Only has a handful of turds.
---
Hunger, thirst, and AP bars were all completely depleted, but I was still alive. Solved the disconnect by being in photo mode with the sticks rubber banded. As long as there‚Äôs some camera movement you won‚Äôt disconnect 
---
Hm. I hadn't considered explosives. I may have just the RL to do the trick, actually. Thanks for the tip!
---
I'm wearing the Beret in style
---
[https://imgur.com/XjoxhTJ](https://imgur.com/XjoxhTJ)
---
Yes officer, this pun right here
---
No. The bars were depleted but I didn‚Äôt die. Just had 0 AP
---
Don't delete! It IS cute!
---
 Farming? Really? Man of your talents?
---
Isn't it rarer than the other masks?
---
I can‚Äôt but it can be labeled as harassment and per the TOS that‚Äôs a violation.  So yeah technically Bethesda has enough grounds to issue a ban here.
---
Eggs are along the river, they're obvious once you get down there. 
---
Makes me wonder if there‚Äôs a possibility of a ‚ÄúRaiderized‚Äù event in the future, not one where everybody fights each other but instead gets together to fight a horde 
---
Wow, imma do this now üòÇ
---
You advice thus far is "stay close and shoot it". I'm not going to lower myself to insults, but you may wish to reconsider whom, exactly, is the stupid one here.
---
Most likely June

Every time I‚Äôve done it, upon completion, it turns into a free for all battle royale in Helvetia.

---
Because I have about 12 giant masks, 4 owl masks, 3 witch masks, 2 soldier masks, 3 bone head masks and still no beret. D: 
---
Thanks, I will stay clear
---
No, someone posted it in discord and we've been having a lot of laughs at your expense. 
---
I need to start playing again I stopped playing months ago. Just got bored. 
---
The berets are a secondary reward, and not in the mask table. 
---
This is wrong. I have 5 from regular runs where no bots died.
---
The regeneration &amp; the squirrel on acid speed were exactly what happened to me the first time. The second time it just scooted around doing circles in the same spot. 
---
Very home-y, I like it!

---
imo. Maybe get rid of all 3 slugger perks. Also, nstead of maxing out 1 slugger perk, you can get 1 of basic, expert and master for 30% increase or get rid of it to make room for bloody mess
---
You dont need to have travel agent and lead belly on the time, im guessing you're looking to get in on the overrated bloodied meta, so put adamantium skeleton somewhere. You need blocker, serendipity, dodgy, evasive, barbarian, nerd rage, ironclad, etc if you're running a bloodied build, a single point in tenderizer/adrenaline makes a whole world of difference. Your build, experiment more
---
üòâüòâ
---
Yep. Because he says it about 72. 
---
I think it‚Äôs the same one, OP‚Äôs photo is just trailing lol
---
That's the masks, not the rather neat beret
---
I'm running a geforce 970 and i5 4690 3.5 ghz and 24 GB ram memory. Would that be enough to run smooth ?
---
Thanks! I'm also making a list of every response the Parade Leader Mr Handy has depending on the mask you wear during the parade (example: if you wear the Soldier mask then interact with him, he'll say "Aren't you a little tall for a Napoleon?")
---
PS4, but i will try to get it till parade ends, then i will trade with masks. Thanks for asking tho. &lt;3
---
Naked too!
---
Do it..whispers..
---
Crouching only negates vats if you haven't hit them yet. Land a bullet on them and you'll be able to vats them afterwards.
---
Well, at least now I know it's not inherently broken. Just a bug. I can live with a bug.
---
Thanks, I really was gonna give up until you told me that
---
:)
---
Also I am pretty sure they do not have to be the "Porcelain" Steins.  He will accept any Stein you pickup in town there is three different types I think...Porcelain, Wood, and I forget the third.
---
50 times?
---
Holy shit man. I thought I was stretching it going at it like 20-25 times. The last time I was so worn out that I just stood in the roof of the church and waited for it to be done. (Feel a little bad for letting everybody do all the work but if I had to dig the guts out of yet another squirrel I was going to flip out) 
---
Still don't have that damn donut recipe either. 
---
How am I supposed to start my bakery? 
---
The beret drops normally at the same rate as the other masks that do appear.
---
lol, makes sense. I couldn't tell due to the doublyness of the OP;s pic
---
Interesting, i was getting damage few times when i was realy hungry. haha, i will try it, but i think much people will be afking around so it wont be worth, Thanks for sharing.
---
Who locks their purifiers?!?
---
Well it's not like it costs money to be able to keep playing..
---
Add me at cardinal19.  I dont need 3 and you can have one fo free
---
Why do I enjoy this so much?!? 
---
Really? I'm going call that statement. There's junk everywhere.
---
You craft ammo from the components you collect. So now you want to, what? Collect resources to make the resources to make ammo? YOu realize what you just asked for? A second layer of crafting. 
---
So what are you going to make aluminium out of? Because you can't. It's a natural element. It's used in a lot of ammo. I'm sure not the ammo you use.  
---
What you really are saying is you want away in your camp, to make gears, springs and screws, from just steel, because you don't like going around picking up junk, and you never know what stuff has the items you need. 
---
There's 24 different items that give 1-4 screws, with the majority of them giving 2. Typewriters, fans, hot plates being the most common, various toy cars/trucks, handcuffs, tongs being the second most. All of them easily found in any destroyed population centers. 
---
The same for gears and springs. So many items.
---
Tag the items you need, and when you encounter them in the game, a little magnifying glass icon will appear in front, letting you know, this contains resources you need. 
---
Find a good salvage route that takes you to 3-4 locations quickly, and every day or so, take 15-20 minutes to run it. In a few days, you'll have a backlog of those items.
---
I am literally sitting on about 1,000 gears, 700 springs, and 300 screws. The screws are less, because I like to make gear for low levels, and place them around Flatwoods. 
---
I never had such problems tbh and I do have a lot of PC games. I never play really old games.
---
I agree on this. I've done this event over and over, its fun and everyone seems to be enjoying it. I've seen all levels of players there working together. I even participated during a nuke strike on the event. 
---
No
---
True but nor should u die in one shot lol
---
I have also seen this.  Saw it a lot while trying to get the New Nuka Paint in Dome 7.  I would open the door and of course the plans would not be there and then slowly everything would start disappearing.
---
It's because someone else went into the area and loaded the cell as their level. They stay that way for quite a while. Since so many people are high levels with a lot over 100 a lot of areas are over leveled. 
---
It sucks, but that's why I'm not starting another character until the reset system gets put in. 
---
I did consider doing that with my slugger perks actually, plus it would allow more in strength like Blocker and my barbarian. And yeah, prior I was using power armor and avoiding all these (No Power Armor) perks but I‚Äôve seen a few videos on what people have built with those perks and it peaked my curiosity. Definitely appreciate the input! Mine prolly won‚Äôt be as strong as some, but it‚Äôs already been a major improvement to what it was before
---
Saw someone matching this description last night on PC at the glitched sloth parade event.
---
The Skull Halloween mask is at the Pumpkin House too, every time I go there the bag of bones in the wheelchair on the patio always has it. 
---
That place is a shit show in terms of knowing where to go haha
---
Wow. That looks almost exactly like my CAMP. I was surprised seeing it because mine is in the Ash Heap.
---
Jerks. 
---
Yeah really need those local maps back..
---
no one cares
---
Don't you take damage when your hunger bar is empty?
---
True but it buys you a little time especially if you have a chameleon piece to throw on.
---
Yeah, min-maxing, only try hards care about those, getting the most damage, etc2. Im more of a mix shotgun build and i do just fine in whatever content. In the end, do whatever makes you comfortable. So, good luck
---
I don't understand, why?
---
Sweet
---
By the time I start contributing to this stuff it's all been done by far more capable players :)
---
Good work OP, really useful post.
---
Actually I'm on xboxü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Since the hotfix. Not since patch 7. 
---
Adding to this, I couldn't get it to trigger with sneak attacks by shooting. Used my sledgehammer and it went through instantly.
---
This ^
---
Why not max out all three Sluggers?
---
So what, each projectile is only doing like 69?
---
i actually don't think it does. i could be very wrong though.
---
The X-01 paint is the promotional Nuka Cola Quantum armor paint.
---
Literally unplayable 
---
All good
---
No, I haven't used it yet. But honestly big targets will be what I save it for probably. Lol
---
Fuck yeah, I‚Äôm actually really happy I‚Äôm seeing more folks with this perspective. Made a post a while back and got bashed for it, basically saying what you said about raiders and griefers. Right on.
---
Thanks for linking that raider sub. Lol 
---
Seneca mountain top camp here. I keep it homely. https://imgur.com/gallery/OVHyyGp
---
Destroy them locking water purifiers is almost as bad as Turret Camps at White Spring.
---
Try keeping track of your public IP, if it's changing frequently it would cause all kind of authorization issues all over the place
---
Lepreghoul
---
Yeah, I suspect the slow load relates to bug fixes. It might also be due to the invisible-teammate bugs. The good news is that many of those bugs do appear to be fixed. 
---
They are legendary modifiers.  Particularly with a bloodied build (stronger/more resistant at lower health) you can get some pretty insane synergy with mutations, perks, armor, weapons,etc.  
---
Pretty hard to find more than one desired legendary effect on the specific weapon/armor type you are looking for, but thats part of the endgame grind.  Best bet if you want a specific item is probably trying to buy from one of the marketplace subreddits.
---
You have other items to close to your instrument. Try moving it to the middle of the room or off the wall. You can definitely use the camera when on the instrument. 
---
I would be happy with any info or communication at all. Been waiting on tickets about my account for 3 months. No response at all. All for one dumb move hitting take all on a bag. No issues at all on my second account because I now know better. 
---
Oversight and all that, wouldn't be the first time.  Im sad i didnt get to see a nuked version of the event yet thatd be cool. The normal one is way too easy.
---
While I wouldn't mind a visible cross-hair while cloaked, I've gotten so used to it that really doesn't matter anymore.
---
I know how to play the game and I know how to tag materials but you don't understand that I don't wanna craft aluminum I can make a harvested for that. I just wanna be able to make components (not metals) so I font have to run around for 20 minutes, but right now if you can get a route setup that farms screw, gears, and springs I'll stop arguing, and if you want delete the post.
---
Yep, if you look at any server's map the average level is always going to be 50+ so unless you get a quiet server it will be really common for the scaling to kick in.
---
It's not for everyone but my way around this for my second character was to spend some time power levelling to get near level 50.
---
Cool indeed, i love turrets so since i'm just 57 i have smaller camp, with new patch i managed to do something bigger, that's an image of my camp in the forest before moving near Watoga, the camp is the same anyway:

There's no way they would ban somebody for using a nuke system they have in place. Using a game mechanic that is specifically designed to destroy an area is not harassment.
---
Many people care. This guy is amazing and does like 7 or more per day. He always seems to have enough people to beat the queen easily. I've joined a few times. His dedication is godlike. Don't be so quick to judge.
---
Yeah but I like my interior decorating as it is
---
You do to an extent, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to kill you, at least not while you‚Äôre in photo mode? I‚Äôm no expert on this, I‚Äôm just reporting I‚Äôve done this at least 4 times for long periods without dying (6hrs was the longest I‚Äôve gone I believe)
---
I believe hunger and thirst can't kill you, only take you down to 5hp. I'v seen hoarders say this about their mules.
---
Sun kissed perk. Rad sponge perk if you're on a team. Decon showers. There are alternatives to radaway. 
---
Also, I have bunches of radaway from turning in tech data.
---
I'm using the sun kissed perk (endurance), it usually takes care of 90% of my rad problems without having the need to use radaway
---
Eventually your health will drop to the point a bloodbug blinking two miles away could kill you, but you'll never actually actually die from food/water loss.
---
I know this is an old post but do you happen to know of any spawn locations for the frogs besides whitesprings?
---
Did you get the automated one that said we anticipate it taking 7-10 days? I think I got that one in February. Nothing since. 
---
Strangler pods turn into strangler blooms....but only while the ‚Äúheart of the swamp‚Äù event is active
---
Here is a thread on market76 of someone on PS4 who was at the event and someone had the winter mask:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/comments/b3l77x/discussion_found_someone_with_the_old_man_winter/
---
So i lock my water purifiers but they've been locked since i built my camp and now i have over 200 so i should unlock it. wasnt aware it was frowned upon. i also lock my resources but all my doors are unlocked
---
Most mmos I've played have preferred farming spots and instanced runs.  Yes most of the map is affected by the rest of the players but there were always options.  ESO had great power leveling spots and quick respawns and i believe shared XP.   This game should have more closely followed ESO's blueprint.  Not everyone wants a long slow leveling experience especially with loot that doesn't scale.   Whitesprings was a great place to get prepared to take on tougher areas.  They should have added 2 more spots, not removed the only one they had.
---
Whatever you do, don't bother with the [Beth.net](https://Beth.net) forums. If you think White Knighting Beth is bad here....
---
It's not really a bug. By default all rooms are unlooted. That is until the server marks the items as taken and they disappear.
---
Same here buddy, I was about to post something similar. I'm approaching level 80, I have a hardened lever arch rifle, hardened pump action and a modded super sledge. I find plenty of legendaries but they drop mostly gunk armor. I want better weapons and to run around with PA but I'm struggling to find decent weapons/armor.
---
Sun Kissed. Good lord, I'm a moron. I read "slowly regen" and grabbed it an equipped it, thinking it was health. That explains why my radiation has been so low recently.
---
I‚Äôd sooner die
---
Yes, more lvl 68 ghouls please :)
---
What do you mean by white knighting?
---
I lock my 7 Industrial purifiers and have 10 smalls unlocked...
---
Locking isn't an issue...
---
Legendary item properties: 
---
* Bloodied - Weapon prefix, do more damage the lower your health
---
* Unyielding - Armor prefix, +3 to all SPECIAL stats (except END) at low health
---
* Sentinel - Armor suffix, damage resist when standing still  
---
In general "bloodied builds" involve a whole bunch of items, perks, and mutations that benefit from low health, and a whole bunch of related defenses so you don't die too often, despite your low health. 
---
No thanks, no humans por favor
---
I also found about 4 outside the chemical plant no event or quest just walked by and picked some. 
---
As of late I'm starting to get attacked by invisible enemies right after loading from fast travel. I'll walk into a location and just taking repeated damage before the enemy finally pops in. 
---
They do that now!?!?!?
---
That's why I am going to start shooting at the roofs. Did you also do this in Cod WW2 with the Infected challenges.
---
for the Xo armour it should be something that could give you bad or good effects as its a protype. example - extreme speed but occasionally it might cripple your legs as the armour moves wrong, something like that. 
---
First time I played this event I helped out recruiting the Joyous Protectron and was dying laughing as he "sang" along with our jam
---
UGH!!! I'm at work again!!! Adding you as a friend tonight so that we can coordinate, as I want to play!!  :)
---
From my experience, it doesn't.  I don't believe any armor penetration effects energy resistance.
---
It might help slightly for plasma weapons, but for laser guns you're out of luck for the time being.  Which is a shame, because I always liked running with a laser rifle.  If they would make it so that armor penetration was available for energy resistance then I could go back to that.
---
Hey, keep your gay agenda out of my super masculine game!
---
Might be the wrong word, I apologise if it is. Basically they have a major hard-on for Bethesda and think they can do no wrong. 
---
This has probably been suggested, but have people tried different combos of bots in the parade? It probably doesn't do anything, but maybe having specific bots increases the chances of rare masks 
---
Haha no! I‚Äôm usually against AFK but in this it really doesn‚Äôt matter much. I need all those camp plans!!
---
Glad I'm not the only one!  
---
Likewise, all the legendaries I find are crap.  
---
I'm happy with my riles and backup Melee (All Rise) but if I can get better I'm up for it!
---
No? Epsilon for float point is only around 1 in 10^(7). Which is what I was trying to estimate by estimating the number of bits. And certainly not impossible as a community - hence two of the rare masks have been seen.
---
So be it, there are a lot of dumbasses around the world, most them seems to be somebody judging on racism or chauvinism basis, not about that people are just dumb sometimes. And honestly I think I see one.
---
I see your point. 
---
My experience/comment dates back to mid PS2 and early PS3 era, so I'm talking issues with single player CD/DVD disk based stuff, not web/steam/valve based.  
---
  After several of my favorite games broke on the computer following OS updates, developer support said the fix was to downgrade the OS.  (Image what it would be like to downgrade from Win 10 to Win 8 solely so you could keep playing 76....)
---
Once I started playing on consoles, I never had that problem, so the takeaway lesson for me was stay on console - it just works.  
---
Ah.  I have corrected my link.  Danke!
---
I wanted to throw emotes around especially during the event and my controllers dpad decided to malfunction today. Can‚Äôt activate the down button at all. Gonna have to take the controller apart perhaps...not trying to buy a new one lol 
---
Ohh ok i kinda assumed something like that happened. I still beat the enemies but lost a ton of stimpacks in the process XD
---
Resources are one thing.
---
But water purifiers are kind of a dick move. They produce so many and players often need them badly so they don't dehydrate.
---
You're a real head turner. 
---
Metal
---
Those things worked in older fallouts when they were the exception. They had a large contrast from the rest of the game. This kinda stuff is very common in 76. It reminds me of GTA online alot in some ways. Especially after seeing the advertisements for 76. I know people will whiteknight Beth no matter what, but you got to atleast put some thought into what you're saying. Jesus
---
I stopped collecting radaway when I had 300. I then stuffed them on my second character to sell but nobody buys them. That tells me they aren't needed.
---
This again? If you are L15 and running around the golf course or fissure, expect it to happen. Go do your quests and come back.
---
I really hope people don't just magically forget all this by E3. The way they've handled 76 Should have some repercussions.
---
Faschant isn't even semi decent and it was designed the same time the rest of the game was
---
One in 10 million is also a hugely small number, but I am glad that the system works as intended.
---
Water leaves less room in me for booze, this is a good idea I wholeheartedly support
---
If I were you I‚Äôd cut a few things out of this build for other more practical things. Bandolier isn‚Äôt really that useful as ammo isn‚Äôt that heavy. You‚Äôre better off here taking traveling pharmacy or pack rat. 
---
Also in endurance natural resistance is a waste since disease cures are everywhere. I would also advise against rad resistance because +40 rad resist isn‚Äôt much and not worth it as there aren‚Äôt an overwhelming number of radiated areas. 
---
Other than those things looks good man shotguns are fun and enforcer is a fantastic perk. 
---
yeah that is not right!seems kinda shady for sure
---
I noticed that our fermenters are linked to our stash. I'm thinking our vending machines will be as well. 
---
I doubt it will be a separate box that you physically put things in. That would circumvent the weight limits. I'll bet the things in the vending machines will also be taking up room in your stash. 
---
 . . . and can you imagine the outcry on YouTube?
---
 Juicehead: "Players Banned for Chasing Rainbows!"
---
I‚Äôm no expert but for what you want to do that looks really good
---
Thanks! I‚Äôve never had any problems in any online game! Wow, diablo, PoE, battlefield etc. It‚Äôs just FO76
---
I saw many low levels in the parade and thought we should give them a chance to at least tag the sloth.
---
I play on PC, and have been happy with the performance and whatnot. 
---
The only downside of PC is that the inter-player prices tend to be higher, presumably due to a lower player population, so if you plan to buy mutations, flux, etc, just adjust your expectations accordingly and plan on paying more caps. For example, PC mutation serums run 400-500 while console prices are routinely posted for 200-300. 
---
Cause that‚Äôs only focusing on damage output and not damage intake. Where my bloodied weapons will handle most of that for me. Plus if all three sluggers are maxed, that‚Äôs 9, only leaving me with 2 other card options to max out when there‚Äôs a few that would be more beneficial if maxed like Incisor or Martial Artist. I‚Äôm surprised no one on this thread told me to use Blocker yet tbh.
---
ah, that might explain it.  At one point during the session, I was on top of a car, but crouched to swing at the bloated ones with a machete.  
---
Also, I have noticed that sometimes when I load in to my camp another camp has to disappear before mine starts loading. That's new...
---
Tru-Hiker or whatever the food reduction perk card is seems to reduce the weight of alcohol, though it's still relatively heavy compared to other drinks for sure.
---
No get a decon shower solve all your problems
---
I promise you it's not an actual circle jerk. There's a small number of people that have alts upon alts to make posts like this over and over. I don't think they're shills, just actually insane.
---
If you look at the days before the new content to the posts that are "I just got the game and X" you'll see 90% of them say the same shit. 
---
I'll unlock now that I know. I'm outta the way in the mire so I don't see alot of foot traffic
---
I wish Red-Eye‚Äôs great great great great (not sure how many) grandchild would come along to utterly destroy Rose, take over the station, and spin some questionable tales of raider happenings... 
---
Where you at Andrew WK?????!!!!
---
S - 15 (Damage, perks)
---
P - Low (Who cares about seeing people far, you are close)
---
E - 6 (I like Cannibal &amp; Lead belly so I can eat on the go, but this one is highly subjective)
---
C - Solo 4, Team maybe higher (Sole Survivor if solo otherwise take a look at perks to decide yourself)
---
I - 5+ (5 for the weapon building and maintenance) If you want Power Armor you may need it higher
---
A - 15 (Perks that refill you AP and damage mitigation perks are a godsend in this category)
---
L - 5+ (If you plan on using mutations you almost need at least 5 just for starched genes &amp; Class Freak)  
---
J47.
---
Processing. Processing.
---
I forgot to mention, but I already have an idea for my strength and luck. 5 luck for luck of the draw and starched genes, and 15 strength for 1 point of slugger, expert slugger, and master slugger, aloneside maxed traveling pharmacy, pack rat, incisor, martial artist.
---
Just power up a station and collect a bunch as and when needed. 
---
Anyway, isnt there still the bug that a depleted core  gets miraculously charged if exit the game while still in PA?
---
What is your "issue"
---
"NERF THE LEPRECHAUN, BETHESDA! I wasted thousand of rounds of ultracite ammo and was disconnected 12 times! FFS!"
---
IMO if you are going for unyeilding and therefore no power armor you are better off going unarmed. You can get a 1\* bloodied power fist or deathclaw gauntlet for not many caps on the trading subreddit and you'd free up some Srength points.
---
Strength could then be Incisor, Martial Artist, Blocker, Barbarian and Iron Fists
---
And Serendipity (luck) is VERY useful if you are out of power armor as well
---
If you want to increase your damage even more you could look at Pro Drinker on Endurance, Party Boy on Charisma and get yourself some whiskey.
---
Personally I tried the whole unarmed bloodied thing but prefer being 2H Melee or Big Guns in my power armor.
---
I'd also note that the excavator has surprisingly good rad resist; better than the T-51b. 
---
Hoot hoot! 
---
Instead of rubber bands I hang my controller off the side of a lamp shade by the analog stick I do this when I have workshops and have to step away.
---
Absolutely.
---
First impressions: you could free up a lot of room and allow for versatility if you only took the first rank of each shotgun damage perk. You get a 30% damage bonus from 3 perks as opposed to a 60% from 9 perks. This could allow you to add rifles or melee as an alternative to shotguns. I'd suggest rifles, because shotguns are close range which won't help if you're a stealthy glass cannon fighting a group of mobs. After the first kill, you're no longer in stealth. You'll want to pick some off from afar before charging in.
---
Also, I'd cut good with salt down 1 or two, and I'd cut natural resistance altogether. Food spoilage with just one rank of good with salt is negligible, and if you're exploring/hunting a lot you'll have too much food for you to even use. This would free up for you to invest more in luck, and take some critical focused perks like grim reapers Sprint, better critical, four leaf clover. These perks pair amazingly with shotguns.
---
Here's a build that I'm using that achieves most of what I think you're looking for and it's working great for me [survivalist build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=86c479a&amp;d=ep0ew1lr1l11li2lv1lb0s71i90i10ic4c72ej4pk0pp2sb1s61pd0ar1ao0au1a50pl0sd0so0eh1ed1as0su1&amp;w=&amp;n=Survivalist). Maybe check that out and it could give you some ideas on refining.
---
All in all, pretty nice build for not having played!
---
You don't deserve the explanation, same as most of us. Lesser creature.
---
BURN HIM! BURN HIM! BURN HIM! BURN HIM!!!
---
Have you ever seen when a giant hits your character in Skyrim and you fly into the sky? That‚Äôs a yeet 
---
Who knew locked purifiers, would get your camp destroyed. I didn't and have had this game since launch. 
---
Once you get the recipe for radaway, and the perks chemist and super duper it's easy to make a batch of 30 radaway and then dilute them. On top of what ghouls drop it's not hard to maintain a stack of them. 
---
Because it's not possible.  The ability to one-shot someone in Pacifist simply doesn't happen.  There is an absolute cap on slap damage, and it even includes collateral damage, like blowing up cars next to players.
---
Either you, or someone on your team, had a Workshop.
---
I'm aware of the mechanics but due to the implementation of the Fasnacht Event it's causing the data to load in an incorrect order or much slower than usual. It doesn't have to be in a highly populated area or anywhere near the even for this issue to occur. It's absolutely a bug of some sort cause by new code breaking already existing code.
---
Spec'd for melee, I stand back by the church and fire a round into the sloth with my BE shotgun and it does very little damage from that distance.  Because the spread is so large at that distance, I and going to get a hit in, but it wont be bearing the brunt of that shot. 
---
Would be a cool mod for the radgun shoots rainbows.
---
Yeah i think laser rifles need like a 10% more buff so 20% more then their original state it should at least rival that goddamn handmade.
---
Well that's what fans do, can't blame them for sticking up for their "team"
---
If you don't do the event old man winter takes away your TSE. You have been warned!
---
For hunting rifle plans I recommend super mutants at summersville. They are very low level and the buildings/rooftops give you good cover and vantage points. You can also scrap the rifles on top of both rooftops. I've used this place a couple of times no on Alts to get my early XP
---
The rainbows always end at a treasure map location
---
To everyone arguing that they need to grind too and the lower levels need to either suck it up or get better, I call BS.  If you're there to simply grind, we get better loot from grinding Whitesprings than what a 1* Legendary Sloth drops.  Everyone complains that SBQ or other 3* enemies only drop 1* weapons and how sick they are of getting another tire iron or rolling pin...yet grinding this event for gear is brought out as an excuse for one-shotting the sloth and not allowing lower levels to share in the spoils?  News flash: that 1* level 35 sloth isn't going to drop a fully-leveled Instigating explosive lever action with 90% weight reduction.  You're going to get yet another tire iron. Or rolling pin. Shit that we will never use.  
---
If you're grinding for the masks and plans, fair enough. One shot the suiciders to your heart's content to keep the bots safe, but let the lower levels get their hits in on the sloth.  So many people show up for this event that I have not seen the sloth even get close to the parade before it drops, so it's not like we're protecting the parade from it by dropping it in a single shot.  At the end, the true threat to the robots comes from the wolves and stingwings that flock in.
---
I think events like this are for fun and camaraderie whereas the vault raids and hopefully the underground areas, will be for people over level 50 to be tense again. At least I hope. 
---
Here's the URL in order to get into the Brotherhood of Steel Discord faster: https://discord.gg/nKv34U
---
(I hope I'm not breaking any rules by posting the URL) 
---
Also to note: We take our duties semi-seriously so we really do try to uphold ourselves as a dedicated group.
---
My issue was more with placement. They have it so they hit the sloth every time. It's like a mini turret farm.
---
The purifiers were just an additional thing that is kind of assholish.
---
I‚Äôm just trying something different, I‚Äôm actually like you. I like my 2H and power armor. And the only gun I used was a .50 Cal for cargobots. Whether I‚Äôll like it or not I dunno, but now you have me second guessing this decision lmaooüòÇüòÇ
---
Nope we had just got on the server. And they were both stuck at the camp because neither knows inventory management and are pack rats. So before we could play I was trying to help them get down to fast travel. I wonder if it could be some sort of bug. My guess was the splash damage from the explosions wasn‚Äôt being taken into consideration.  
---
You can only tag 3 people at once, moron.
---
Yeah one in each perk for shotgun definitely would suffice
---
Just been playing different games that all. 
---
There's a white russian recipe?! :D I'm going to be the Dude from now on :D
---
i ran out of 10mm :(
---
False.  I got it without any bots dying.
---
I don't even *want* it, but I'm holding onto it for trade value in the future.
---
My pc is a bit lower specced than yours and it runs fine, I haven‚Äôt had issues since beta, EXCEPT, I discovered that the higher my carry weight the worse everything got. At about 1000lbs things got laggy and slow, over that it was progressively worse. This was before the hard limit (I was farming mats for the excavator armor). Not sure why you‚Äôre having issues but that‚Äôs the caveat of pc gaming: every rig is unique and needs fine tuning to get your game optimal. Try changing a few settings and see if it improves. 
---
I've been experiencing the materializing CAMP issue prior to the Fasnacht Event. It seems even worse now.
---
It's a peaceful life ;)
---
Huh, I lock my purifiers. That's a big part of my barter/income. If you're thirsty, there's a pump and a cooking station at the front of the house. Go nuts.
---
Pack rat is awful, as is strong back.  Traveling pharmacy is just ok
---
Oh, they've seems to be expected you do to that earlier. 
---
400 damage (especially on a dragon) can be easily resisted without Sentinel Assassin.
---
He was likely running serendipity, LW, Nerd rage, other perks.
---
The event blocks players from being killed until its done, as a griefing countermeasure.
---
How did you get to level 117 in the beta? Are you alive?
---
It's probably unwise to build something around a single enemy, but Unarmed is going to have trouble against things like the Scorchbeast Queen because her rad output is so crazy these days.  Just something to keep in mind.  Obviously, a lot of melee perks benefit all forms of melee.
---
I figure that's partially why Unarmed is so much stronger than the others to begin with.  There's a trade-off when it comes to radiation and Power Armor.  In the past, the SBQ used to humor this.  If someone left Drop Site C2 unbombed, you could go in and hack at the SBQ in Unarmed.  But ever since Patch 6 or so, it's like her "cropdusting" rads never stop.
---
Ranged- explosive instigating gauss 
---
You talking about the moon mask with the rocket in the eye? Their was a guy last night with one at the event and everyone lost their mind. I didn't think it was special so I don't have a picture but they are out there even if they may have cheated to get one. Might run through my PC photos see if I may have caught him in one last night.
---
So unfortunately because it's a public event, it's extremely hard to get random people to follow a goal. If it hadn't been for that, I would started to conduct my testing. I know for sure the specific robots always wear the same masks.
---
Beekeeper- sun.
---
Antiques- Jester
---
Decorator- Devil
---
Baker- soldier
---
Candlemaker- toothy
---
Butcher- witch
---
Musician- skull
---
Woodcutter- giant
---
This is an issue I had since FO4. I see people recommending putting a dot on your monitor. I myself made a vats/sneak build so I wouldn't need to manually aim!
---
Only one at a time, they don't have to indulge themselves with intercourse, otherwise all before you know it they will be everywhere!
---
You Fuel-lovers with your Flamethrowers had your chance at a proper outrage-rally, now it's time for us Rainbow-lovers with our Sparkledusters!
---
On a serious note: Fuel comes from tidily curled-up-top paper bags, vendor-station suitcases and caring friends, I do not know what this "crafting" riddle is that you speak of!
---
It's your mods and/or custom ini file. 
---
Moon 1 is an atom shop item
---
No perks, mods, legendary effects, quite literally nothing gives armor penetration to laser weapons in FO76. 
---
The reason being that all those aforementioned things provide armor penetration by effectively reducing enemy ballistic resistances and do nothing to their energy resistances. This is easily proven via testing with the Awareness perk. It worked the same way in FO4. 
---
Numerous posts have been made and it is included in the current unofficial bug list but obviously was not addressed at all by Bethesda when the buffed energy weapons last patch.
---
TSE damn near anything before the nerf. It's still powerful, but nowhere near as broken as it used to be. Now it's bloodied (Probably), but I don't use it so I haven't tested it out. 
---
So many points in agility is not necessary, especially with a high strength build. Also, if you want to OHKO enemies from sneak, focus on rifles instead of shotguns. You'll also want higher intelligence as crafting is very important in this game. Also lose all three END cards, Rads and environmental diseases are almost non-existent. You'll have plenty of Radaway, and diseases last a short while and Disease Cures are easy to find/make. I suggest Lead Belly instead, as cooked food still gives rads in this game, but don't cause diseases. Same with good with salt: there's so much food to find that you can cook and eat way faster than it spoils (food is also a cheap way to restore health). Put in Lucky Break instead. Definitely lose Night Eyes. The nights in this game are almost as bright as day and night vision will actually make things too bright to play. Replace it with grenadier: explosives are excellent in taking down large groups of enemies. Also replace Bandolier with travelling Pharmacy 2.
---
It's a new bug, happens to me
---
The commie whacker. 
---
I'm beginning to believe they really are Daily at this point, and/or you actually get one shot at doing them per day.  If you leave them incomplete, they won't come back.
---
jamming out with my new look
---
I see, thanks for the insight
---
Ok thanks
---
Agreed to everything you said.
---
Would love to see some events or quests that you can only do at certain levels.
---
I stopped using radway.
---
On my main character I use perks - Share Radponge with team mates to heal each other's rads.
---
Swap in Sun kissed for the rads and Photosyn for health if playing solo.
---
On my alts I use the decon shower at the Blackwater Mine. It's behind the closed door on the right as you walk in. Press the button and walk through it slowly. There is another one at the enclave bunker service entrance. With these showers being close to the disease curing fountain at whitespring I use this area to "clean up". Recovering health with food or jumping off a cliff.
---
It has been rumored that the level of participation during the preparations (collecting wood/intestines/wax/steins) might have an influence on the final reward. Any insights on that?
---
A little hint. Right after the rewards drop check paper bags on the ground. A lot of people will just drop duplicates and that's how I got about half of my parade recipes. 
---
Oh wow that's a good point. Hadn't thought of that at all but you might be on to something.
---
I suppose I'll see what I get tonight when I do it.
---
Pairs well with things like the BoS outfits too.
---
I grew up poor. No power armor so we couldn‚Äôt afford to go into nuke zones. 
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a powerful melee :p
---
Never leave the game at whitesprings. You should know better. 
---
Any specific weapon types?
---
Instigating grognaks with swing speed and +1 Strength 
---
This... Saved me a ton of google. Thanks man! Something so simple that I overlooked. 
---
It's not. The number of surviving robots only affects your chance to get loot not what the loot is.
---
In the four times I've run through Fasnacht, I've never gotten the same mix for all four.  The Decoration Protectron is sadly not always there, though I have gotten it three out of four times.  The Candlemaker is also three out of four for me.  The rest have appeared twice, and for me, the rarest has been the Woodsman... I've only gotten him once.
---
Pro-tip: if your group can, always go for the Baker, Beekeeper, and Historian first.  They by and far take the longest to move into position for the parade after their task is completed.
---
much thanks, hadn't figured it was something like that i will
---
I've never seen Poseidon nuked.  But I have seen multiple drop on Monongah.
---
Take a ton of stimpacks and a few radaway. You'll be fine.
---
Could of just left the server... 
---
I had one, don‚Äôt like the fire mechanism myself though. I‚Äôm curious what other people will say :)
---
THink there should me more events that have a set entry requirement for number of players and maybe levels too.
---
Say for example you can only open X Vault if 4 players press the button simultaneously (would force teams of two to try team up with others or maybe anescort event where you have 4 heavy items that you have to transport somewhere so need to spread the load
---
 I created an acount cause THIS is a nast one. So many useles information on this achivement/chalenge. Worst some say u only can get it fron Queen fight !!!!
---
Ok yes u get it fron the swamps creatures... but not Mirelunks but fron Mirelurk hatchling (thus make senses u get woops fron the weakness enemy of fallout).
---
I get a hint to get it fron queen spawn but it hard to let they hit with the queen near. So I went plan B (and I had to fail 4 times and get twice it's done \[cause on 1st no diseace one apear fron eggs\]).
---
On Highland Marsh NW of map u have to kill 3 Mirlunks and a queen (the 3 can change up to king). Them u have 3 or 4 egg nests. Just get a gun (no spread dmg) and get eggs to make hatchings ... hatch.
---
Them VATS to check if any is a dicease type. Kill any who isent and wait. I had to wait some time with 2 hiting me but its a SURE way to get it. There isent a second disease these newborn can spread.
---
An this is why most people that got it by acident have no idia what gives it (cause its a realy small newborn baby).
---
How cool would a separate pvp area be like in ESO?  The raiders the enclave and the BOS could all be trying to take over what's left of a large city.  Winning faction for that week gets rewards.  Infinite crafting  bags with subscription.  Free fast travel between way shrines.  Clans.  Player vending.  PVP challenges instead of unwanted PVP.   Scaled loot.  Co OP runs.  I hope this game becomes more like ESO.  Not less
---
kinda is for server maintenance purposes. but again, for us, its totally a gameplay improved. nothing makes me wanna punch my screen than all my ammo gonne due to a disconnect at the SBQ lol  
---
You didn't say most powerful, you said best.
---
I was under the impression that Rad Shield didn't, but Rad-X did.
---
&gt;I have now gotten five (5) Toothy Man Masks in a row last night, the absolute worst mask you can get
---
Well, that's just like, your opinion man....
---
It‚Äôs better than a super sledge with the same stats?
---
The only PvP that is cool is the bare knuckle boxing matches  
---
Ahh okay
---
Ah, you got me there :p
---
If I were you reading all these comments I'd have no idea what to go with now :-D
---
You could always look at rifles for another character if you want something really different. They seem to be a lot more suited to no PA as you are far from the enemies and you can get really nice damage on them with a bloodied rifle build.
---
Of course, happy to clear that up. It's an issue I've followed closely since release because I've always loved laser and plasma weapons in the Fallout series and immediately noticed in FO76 that they suck for the most part.
---
Though I will say the gatling laser and gatling plasma are pretty great following the last patch that buffed their durability (and slightly buffed damage as well).
---
Any ranged weapon could output MASSIVE damage. Handmade was a favorite since it's base damage was around 270, high RoF, and great accuracy. Combat Shotguns were also extremely powerful since each pellet did a lot of damage, but killing yourself was also very easy. You could kill any enemy besides the Queen in under a second if you had a half decent build. Regular scorchbeasts would just get melted in the Nuke zones when doing SBQ runs. 
---
Yea... tbh I'm considering just uninstalling, unsubbing, and being done with it all. I'm not even banned and they've lumped me in with cheaters, plus everyone I used to play with has moved on, the whole situation has just left me with a sour feeling.
---
Mutations are your friend
---
that is not how it works with bugthesda games.
---
the "rainbow" that would be delivered would have the form of a sinus. and when you look through a scope on the rainbow the sinus would turn into a cosinus. and when you leave the scope the whole world would just be painted in rainbow colours until you server hop.
---
I have one without the +1 Strength. Can confirm it's very nice. 
---
I know, you are right, and that is *exactely* why next up we will march for the Advanced Water Pipe Kits to bring back bathroom hygiene to the mountains of Appalachia, one satisfying flush at a time!
---
Yeah they are
---
HAHA, no i was at my player base and fast traveled there. I never EVER leave the server there
---
Locked Water purifiers?
---
Bases get blown up over that?
---
But i wanted loot man.....
---
so much this...got my balloons and bonfire that way
---
Sounds like you've received some supportive advice already, but here's another tidbit: if there's a herd of muties around, stay as close to them as possible (so the bot will circle near you) but don't take them on. Supermutants hate cargobots and will focus on shooting them down if you don't distract them. Same with the securitron. Let the Mutants take out the machines; just land one shot on the machines so you get loot from them after the mutants have downed them.
---
Rarer than the other 4 it seems, but not really rare on it's own either.
---
No, the super sledge you can add the heated mod, so it has higher damage. 
---
Maybe they could make raider power armor give an attack bonus against other players. Ultracite gives an defense or attack bonus against scorched. X-01 has enhanced resistance against energy and rad damage, and T-45, T-51, and T-60 have increased fusion core duration. 
---
Thanks, i usually just make a huge un-decorated house with things just placed randomly.
---
But only if the Beekeeper protectron spawns. \*ba dum tish\*
---
Legendary armor effects can do a lot more for you than Power Armor does.  But sometimes, you don't have much of a choice, particularly in nuke zones or against the SBQ lately.
---
I collect and maintain the different suits of Power Armor as something to do, but I really only bring it out if I'm doing one of those activities, or if I'm critically over-encumbered and need to get back to CAMP.
---
I mean it's pretty bad to be fair. 
---
Builds aside ranged would be the Gauss or dragon TSE.  
---
With perks they should be close to 500 and 800.
---
As for melee super sledge, grognaxe, or maybe deathclaw?
---
On a serious note though, it's HUGELY dependent on context and play style.
---
An instigating or bloodied 2-H melee weapon could be the single best option for single player, normal combat where you are the only one hitting things, and you can always kill in one hit.
---
But they would be miserable for team-based stuff.
---
Or how bloodied can be the most powerful when combined with unyielding armor, but that sucks in a nuke zone because of the constant need to micro-manage your HP/Rads so you stay at max damage but don't die.
---
Or if you suck at aiming you could make a super-powered VATS build that is the best because it's basically aimbotting.
---
So every answer comes with a grain of salt.
---
Yeah id say so having used both 
---
Ok.  I've done the event probably 10 times (five times per night so far).  
---
More of an event mechanic question then.  I've noticed that when they reach the end where the wolves, sting wasps, and Sloth attack, the "Dead Robot" count disappears before you actually clear out the enemies then light the pyre.  I wonder if it matters to the end results if any of the 5 robots die after the (x/5) count disappears but before the enemies are still alive and the event isn't completed.  From a purely event mechanic point of view, not reward quantity/quality.
---
As i said to others here, it sucks to have a base leveled, mines nearly max budget, if someone were to flatten it, it'd be expensive, BUT its the fastest way to rack up a high bounty for high stakes bounty hunting. 
---
You didn't get griefed. You were Martha and Thomas Wayne to the wasteland Batman. 
---
Maybe the raider had a like Frank horrigan moment with an abomination of a camp defying physics (my personal trigger to go boom) 
---
Looks homey. I wish I had the patience/creativity to go for something other than functional boxes with ironic splashes (like toilets in the living room).
---
I personally think a lever is the best ranged. I use my super sledge to one shot ememies, but my buzzblade for the queen and mobs. Overall my buzzblade does the most DPS than any other weapon I‚Äôve used. 
---
‚ÄúLook at this shit! My rainbow is projecting up through the ground!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúBethesda is pushing the LGBTQ agenda on us!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúHow about fixing the fucking [insert item here] before giving us rainbows!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúI data-mined the game file and it turns out rainbows are completely unrelated to rain effects!‚Äù
---
‚Äú900-hour player here. If the rainbow ends within your camp where you have a detached foundation piece, and you move your camp, the rainbow will go with you until you scrap that piece. Beware! I got banned for this!‚Äù *Bethesda replies: no you didn‚Äôt. You had 260,000 ultracite.*
---
That really doesn't help identify clanmates out in the field.  If it were just 5 guys who knew each other it doesn't matter.  If there are 50 people in the clan it would be nice to know them when you run into them or know there workshop is under attack if you'd like to help
---
Wew now that is something.
---
To be clear I don‚Äôt mean what you personally do during the quest. I‚Äôm referring to the rating score the robots give to whoever turns in that part of the quest. The historian for example gives you a report in your notes that marks each of your contributions as either ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù or adaquet. The decorator likewise gives a decimal based score on how well the room is decorated. I‚Äôm wondering if all the stines were marked as excellent and the room received a perfect score would it increase the groups chance of getting something rare.
---
I had an IE dragon, 900 dmg first shot.
---
Nice selfie stick
---
I've nuked the plant, Its range also covered the Charleston junk yard and the fire department.  There was nothing noteworthy spawning sadly
---
I think the toothy man is the best of the 5 common masks.

---
This is the build I just made, how good is it? 
---
Can't wait to see how the poll goes. 
---
Why recommend the axe over a sledge? Any advantages?
---
Thanks for the advice! Maybe I'll use some of thise Stealth Boys I have lying around, make things a bit easier.
---
There have been quests that in some cases could not be completed without waiting for a server reset or server hopping. This is an accurate statement which can be verified with research or experience. Stating "nor is it relevant today, since they were fixed a long time ago" only serves to confirm that this type of problem has occurred and validates the assertion; but...
---
Recently I became aware that a newly added quest or series of actions could potentially have the same type of error.
---
I didn't make it up. Others have reported it from their own experience and even documented it on video.
---
My post was intended (hopefully) to alert Bethesda to be more careful about any added quests or content, such that what may have worked with single player quest logic does not necessarily work in a multi-player persistent game world where other players can break the quest triggers. This is what seems to be happening.
---
In developing new content for FO76, Bethesda could identify a set of rules, do's and don'ts, and best strategies in order to minimize the possibility that a player is unable to complete a correctly followed quest. The most recent example gives us evidence that they have not perfected that as of yet, so I wrote a post.
---
My sole purpose for posting here is to call attention to something that may help improve the game for all of us.
---
I don't intend to misinform, but a thought popped into my head while doing the decorating the barn part of event - does the decorations you pick have any bearing on the rewards?
---
It's an interesting thought, but I've had at least one Fasnacht where he didn't spawn in; if that were the case, I think he'd always be there.  And the three he did, he gives me the same grade every time.  Apparently, someone's just being a picky protectron.
---
This is my melee build right now if you want to take part from this and add it to your build.

 I also use Marsupial, Speed Demon, and Twisted Muscles.
---
How am I supposed to smuggle in my level 5 wiffle ball bat then? Oh...never mind.
---
Why did they invite you to kill people?

The more downvoted we get in the fo76 sub means we are saying truth. Keep it up wastelander!
---
Early on in the game I had exited at the whitesprings train station. I logged in about 5 seconds before a nuke drop. Instant Ash. Lesson learned. Lol
---
I am solo most of the time, sometimes team 
---
I play for fun with friends, i‚Äôm not a serious competitive player and don‚Äôt like PvP at all.
---
what would be your first ranged weapon of choice for someone like me?
---
I heard if u nuke Charleston capital building area when there‚Äôs ghouls there it spawns as many as whitesprings 
---
Its a good build, I think ill use glow sights and make green thumb a swap out swap in for me, thanks
---
Dude. Purrified water farming in fo4 was my jam. 
---
I just don't think there's much return on them in 76
---
There still so many mask for me to get and probably plans and yet I keep getting dupes ik the feel man and we only got 5 days left, I assume maybe 4 since it probably poofs midnight 26.
---
Had 1 robot die and the event failed..so..
---
womp womp
---
If they‚Äôre full at health. 
---
Nice man, I like the lever out of all ranged weapon the most aside from the LMG, I like how it looks and fires and reloads, what lever should I go for? What legendary traits?
---
That's why I play on PC. Less childish behavior.
---
The "not being able to be killed while down" stuff is apparently a bug. Life-saving armor has a 50% chance to revive, and is working as intended. That's the difference. And the guy was being a jerk with his unreachable Seneca Rocks CAMP in the first place, then decided to go taunt people at Helvetia when the event started. After the last patch you don't get a 25 cap bounty by accident. You can't just shoot a CAMP object or turret once, you have to actually destroy something, in fact multiple somethings, that don't belong to you, OUTSIDE PVP (They fixed that too. You can shoot hostile player's workshop turrets and other objects now with no penalty) to get a bounty that high. Go take a workshop if you want to PVP, don't smash someone's house and then go hide somewhere you can't be reached or sit in an event where you can't be killed. This is obviously something Bethesda didn't intend and it will eventually be patched. And yes, I got him in the end but that doesn't mean I shouldn't report an exploit for Bethesda to see and fix, right?
---
Then this isn't the game for you, because what you don't like about it, is literally some of the games base design. 
---
Here's a route for you. Flatwoods, there's about 6 fans, 3 typewriters. Then to McClintock for tons of springs and ballistic fibers if your luck. Run down to Charleston, the Herald and the Hornwright buildings, typewriters, fans, clipboards, hotplates. Run over to Silva farm, few toys, a full Giddyup, and other stuff. Run over to Sunshine Meadows, and another full Giddyup, plus other stuff. Generally nets me about 30 screws gears and springs or more depending on how full it is. If McClintock hasn't been hit up, you can get 28 springs from all the clipboards there. 
---
I'm also thoroughly confused how this is a one-star three-point card 
---
That bug (my favorite) was fixed a while ago sadly
---
Ok well I haven't tried such things yet so I didn't know of the prices.  Other than that If PC has better performance than my ps4 then I think I will switch. Just need to be sure if my gtx  970 and i5  4690 can handle it 
---
Seems to have gotten worse since Patch 7.  Related to the increase in loading times it seems.
---
Yep, that‚Äôs why the first shot counts the most, :)
---
This has always been this way for as long as I've played.  If a high level character comes into the area it will often times respawn with high level mobs.  But the reverse is also true I've run into areas and had mobs be low level when I'm high level and as they respawn they become higher level.  I usually try to kill off everything if I'm high level so if someone low level comes into the area  they get a fresh correct level spawn.  I don't normally hang out in any area too long and I know how much it can hurt if this happens when your lower level.
---
  You are roaming outside of the forest (and a higher level has been around recently).  That'll do it every time.
---
As an aside, Roses quest will send you to places you really should probably not be at that level, or are going to be really difficult at that level.
---
Server hop or revisit later - enemy level will change. First time I did path of the wind (as a 15 or so) I was with a L70.  Everything was L48+ mutants.  Couple weeks later I did it solo - mostly L6 scorched. 
---
Ditto the excavator quest.  Did that solo, first time was swarms of L48+ mutants, and I never made it past the lobby.  Couple days later, solo again, but only encountered a handful of ghouls, 3 mole miners....and a glowing Wendigo.
---
This is what I had to do. My TV has some lines running down that aren't quite in the center. Was throwing my aim off at the time. I'll buy a new TV eventually. 
---
You are a braver man than I
---
Buddy. It‚Äôs a live service game that has turned into fucking Habbo Hotel and the Sims. Nothing like the whimsical Fallout we know and love. 
---
Assaultron head makes my crotch glow...
---
I seem to recall that some of the data miners found entries for new unique weapons.  Don't know about new weapon *types* though.
---
My 40% swing speed bowie knife has lots of fun popping every balloon on the route.
---
Also, they're camp is in event lines. They literally just gotta hang out and they complete it
---
I don't shoot it, I just jump on top of it and panic emote.
---
PC. Better community and less childish behavior.
---
PVP is a game of hit the target first. Armor is less effective when damage numbers are higher.
---
I dunno, man. People gotta have those BIG DAMAGE screenshots. My strength isn't even maxed out. Never goes anywhere near 50. But it could and some people do. 
---
Honestly, maximum damage output requires you to sacrifice a good deal of quality of life perks that make the game enjoyable.
---
You're right, too. It's not like you can kill things in less than one hit, so anything over 600 damage is kinda pointless. 
---
They should remove weight reduction for alcohol from Tru Hiker then, and move that benefit to Professional Drinker, so it works synergistically with the other alcohol perks.
---
Or the effects would at least have to not stack with Tru Hiker
---
I'd say bloodied/Instigating. 2 shot kills the accuracy unfortunately.
---
If you can, also try and get explosive since it is still a powerful addition.
---
I walked up to one of the guys and gave him a wave during the event that's when he invited me to join his team and party, they thought it was so funny trapping guys in corners with their deathclaw gaunlets.
---
Nice build, if you're really into roleplaying an explorer/treasure hunter type of character, consider getting fortune finder at 16 and cap collector at 22 to swap in and out when appropriate. Perhaps even the perceptibobble or pannapictagraphist perks if you don't get them in a pack. Many would see those as a waste of points especially if you're looking into PVP or trying to maximize your dmg output and resistances right away, BUT it would be a unique aspect to an explorer build and you can always swap them out.
---
I personally wouldn't put all your eggs in one basket right away with shotguns unless you are certain. Perk packs allow you to experiment quite a bit, so I'd invest into some of the weight perks early on so you can carry around more and experiment with different weapons, armors and items.
---
How are you lumped in if you are not banned?
---
You so you man, there are many other games that are just as enjoyable. I'm just a big fallout fan so I try to stick with it.
---
You've also caught a break - you were not on the server(s) where the Parade was nuked...
---
Unlikely. Had a run where i was the only one doing the event for a while. 
---
Did the eggs, music, wax half the wood and half the steins i think and i didn»õt get anything fancier than usual.
---
Have you tried the clothing vendors at Whitesprings? Also there is a old fashioned suit and top hat at Helvetia, where the historian bot lives
---
Fuck that, you're already getting your dose of radiation anytime you eat or drink. Adding to that is madness.
---
I kill everyone after the event. Its fun. Alot of us like it. Usually a few people are down to clown and we dont know until we SLAP everyone and see who SLAPS back. 
---
You dont speak for everyone. Heck, you dont even speak for *most* people.
---
Run away if you get upset about dying. 
---
Can we report posts that are basically "hey raiders, fuck you"?... Seems pretty inappropriate, borderline witch hunting &amp; doesnt add any value. 
---
Yeah, still just a novelty weapon.
---
Still weird they would invite you if they were planning to kill randoms.
---
Always
---
I have 86 beer on my main rn with max thru hiker. Weighs 8 pounds total lol
---
Well it‚Äôs more for like the personal challenge of it. I‚Äôve actually never tried the Queen yet, it‚Äôs pointless if you don‚Äôt have a well coordinated team, and I don‚Äôt lol. But when I‚Äôm facing regular SB it‚Äôs really just a massive waiting game for them to land till I can tear their ass up. But there aren‚Äôt really enemies I struggle with, so I wouldn‚Äôt say I building something around a specific enemy.
---
Thanks, buddy!
---
Must be survival prep. Cool 
---
Update was Tuesday 
---
I did place my camp just west of Helvetia and it keeps getting partially destroyed due to an enemy spawn point near it. Most repairs while I‚Äôm AFK aren‚Äôt bad, but they did destroy my decontamination shower which I‚Äôm pissed about. 
---
This.  Sentry Bots have become one of my favorite items to farm.  They usually drop 100+ 5.56 ammo, a decently charged fusion core, and other loot as well.  The best part is their XP is in the neighborhood of 700.  That‚Äôs practically scorchbeast terrority.  With my shotgun build I can take one down in 3-5 blasts depending how close I am.  
---
I‚Äôve been wondering if incisor works with unarmed weapons like the fist, it does?  Fantastic.
---
They are broken and I hope someone on the dev team notices, feel like if I made a ticket they probably will get it noticed but how long couple months before the ticket gets to the devs? lol
---
Right, but this is why builds matter. With adrenal at 1/2 health and now I‚Äôm over 1k on the dragon.  Or 3/4 health with the bloodied dragon and close to 1500. 
---
With sentinel or unyielding on top of that. 
---
Yeah I didn't think I had seen it before
---
I've seen a couple variations on this.
---
The first is that I get to a Horde event and the Legendary simply isn't there, but they magically show up about a minute later.
---
The second is the supposed boss isn't Legendary, but some completely unrelated nearby enemy is.  I remain convinced that there's some kind of inheritance bug in the game - the same reason why we see aberrations like Stingwings or Rad-Rats with the properties of Sentry Bots.  For whatever reason, the game cannot keep its enemies straight.
---
[No need fixing what is not broken!](https://i.imgur.com/hpqYoav.png)
---
Perhaps, like Mardi Gras, the final night will be the "big" parade where the rare items drop?
---
I got it with a mask but no plans, all robots alive. I did have a time all robots survived and only got 1 plan no masks or hat.
---
Well, you can tell how much I use explosive guns...
---
I literally use 1-3 bullets depending on rng, so easy to kill and you get a tasty 500 exp :D
---
Aren't the witch mask and monster mask hardest ones to get?
---
Now we're talkin
---
I got all the plans/recipes. Just keep getting the same masks... :(
---
I haven't seen it in 76 but in Fallout 4 the heavy combat armor looked very similar to the old stuff. Or did I dream that? Seems that if it was in 4 it's in 76. Everything else is. 
---
Haven‚Äôt checked whitesprings but I will
---
They won‚Äôt allow fast travel into a nuke zone but they seem to do this a lot! lol
---
Raaaaaaaaaccciiiissst
---
I like my anti-armor a lot more.
---
I'm not entirely sure. My current main character is bloodied melee build, so that has made me lean towards transitioning into a heavy-weapons build so I don't need to re-allocate all of my strength points.
---
But, given ANY option, I'd like to get away from bloodied because low-health management sucks. Primary effect would be varied, but whatever that is, these two are basically set in stone for me as "best options if I can get them"
---
* Secondary: Explosive since it's the best damage increase
---
* Tertiary: Probably reload speed increase for overall DPS increase
---
For primary, maybe something like an instigating gauss for high damage on opening shot. Otherwise, two-shot for anything that's moderate damage. Anti-armor would be a good alternate. They could work with basically anything from a shotgun to minigun to handmade rifle.
---
For something like a fatman you could get away with "Quad" so you're trading a bunch of shots in a row vs one harder hitting shot much more slowly with a damage increase effect.
---
I have seen quite a few, but don't usually take note. I think the north side of the creek that runs to Flatwoods, between Flatwoods and the covered bridge. 
---
Giant toads can be found at the light house occasionally, and also occasionally in Grafton. 
---
I‚Äôve got a BE and a bloodied vats crit. They are both beasts, but the one with 15% fire rate is my favorite 
---
I am grinding furiously to find one 
---
Just the same world and group.
---
The lack of communication from Bethesda is insulting.They have no idea how to support a game.
---
Rainbows were a promise that Man will not be destroyed by Flood. 
---
They have no place in a world where Man will inevitably destroy himself with atomic fire. 
---
Valid points. Or, you could just not be able to join team events while wanted. Does it really make sense to have a group of people let a known outlaw into their midst? I sure wouldn't trust a wanted criminal famous for breaking and stealing people's shit...There has to be a better way than just sticking them in your group.
---
But they wouldn't be rechargable like a cell phone battery.
---
After the TSE nerf I realized that my gear was carrying my build and replacing my strategies. I think a lot of players found themselves in the same boat, but they don't want to acknowledge it as a problem with them and their build.
---
&gt;I'm sure everyone just server hopped to another event anyways.
---
Takes about two seconds to server hop. Way less time than it took him to launch the nuke. 
---
Let's be honest, shooting at it is how it *should* work.
---
In fact, what would be really cool is if it gave you a few seconds to unleash as much damage as you could against it, and it factored that into the rewards.
---
good idea! ill for sure look around more afterwards!
---
Awesome... Thanks!
---
I was assuming the concrete was used as grinding stone to make the flour, just like a mill would do.
---
Do you honestly think SF puts their guns away and draw a knife when they enter a building? Wow. That is a whole new level of ignorant.
---
My brother, and 2 other friends got banned wrongfully, 2 of them didn't even get an email why. So I've been lurking the forum and this sub trying to fight the good fight for those who were wrongfully banned. But I'm just tired now XD
---
You should have taken a screen shot and posted their names. 
---
I would still have to unequip cards to fit them. All my cards are levelled, so what we really need is a deck/loadout.
---
There will be survival servers where players will be able to influence who is able to go where. Until they are released, it is the game that sets the interaction rules.
---
I‚Äôve put up industrial unlocked ones along with all benches open to all and some just want to destroy stuff... seems you can‚Äôt win either way...
---
Now now, if you don't support the Ghoul Faction every now and then, where do you think their reinforcements are coming from when they respawn at Whitesprings?
---
Probably bugged atm, happened to me so I had to relocate entirely, stopped happening after I moved
---
Life saving armor has a 50% chance and Mysterious Savior has a higher chance if fully equipped.  They can both work together.  This is not an exploit.
---
So you're salty at him for being a jerk (and yeah he's a jerk), but you're going to report him for possibly being helped by a bug?  Really? 
---
Let me ask you this: in the heat of battle was time compression hitting you (where time seems to be passing much slower due to adrenaline)?  Is it possible that he sat there crippled for the normal amount of time and it just seemed like it was longer? 30 seconds can feel like an eternity when you're hyped up.  We already know that specific armor and perks would negate your killing blows when he's a razor's edge away from death, so that isn't a bug or exploit, but a planned game mechanic.
---
And Seneca Rocks may be inaccessible to you, but not to others.  I can get up there without a jetpack just by using marsupial and strange-in-numbers for the south peak (from the southeast) or just marsupial to access the north peak (from the north) and a simple jump from there to the south peak.  And I am NOT using an exploit because you can walk into the bunker and buy marsupial serum, and you can equip strange-in-numbers. 
---
I see, but what if your camp is outside Helvetia? And has been for months. Asking for a friend.
---
Thank you for making this list. Good info for everyone. A couple corrections:
---
\- The wood shack is behind the yellow restaurant where the baker is. 
---
\- The candlemaker is in the building across the street from the building where you decorate. 
---
\- It seems that the honeybeasts spawn between the Honey Haus and the butcher's house.  I almost always find them right up against the back of the buther's building.
---
As I learned last night, go check for the baker first! That always seems to be the last one done and he takes FOREVER to walk all the way to the parade start. Start at the east end of town and work your way west.
---
Also, be careful picking up extra stuff if you plan on doing the event multiple times. If you picked up a stein from one location, even if it respawns you won't be able to pick it back up in that same spot. So if you pick up extras, don't scrap them. Had the same issue with beeswax. I scrapped my extras and the next event I did I couldn't collect any from the hives. I don't know if this changes if you hop servers because I typically don't.  Intestines and eggs haven't been an issue for this. Mainly just wax and steins.
---
Waaah. 
---
You can always log off if you land in a spot like that and you3 armor or weapons are all broken. Otherwise, run to cover and find a spot where they can't all attack you at once. 
---
Have a friend of mine thats a 112.  
---
I dont know his specific build, but I know he launches solo on a regular basis.
---
A great daily mission would be to find the treasure buried at the end of it! What a great idea! I, too, want rainbows in Appalachia!
---
Happened to me too. 2 times now 
---
Bloody explosive gatling laser. Hands down.
---
The tux was an atom shop item, dunno if you can find them in the game now
---
Lighter, easier to repair, looks awesome 
---
there are several one star multi-point cards. It is to get the perk that has a larger impact than a single point would warrant, but cannot be tiered. 
---
You can hear players moving in some 7 and stuff disappears when no ones there also. 
---
As a man who enjoys his suits in real life:
---
*There are no good suits in this game*
---
A few dirty suits you can find. Dirty tan suit for example. A few atom shop tuxedos, which are ugly.  A few atom shop suits with wacky patterns... Also ugly.
---
Still waiting for some nice business attire. Id love a blue blazer, nice slacks and white button up. Classic look. 
---
People are just having fun man, lighten the heck up! It's a celebration, bitches!
---
Fire off a few rounds and stop being such a grumpy Gareth!
---
Some people are reporting that at various stages, things are not necessarily found or working as expected. Sometimes items are missing, sometimes locked areas are already open, or sometimes a code doesn't work.  It is my theory that this is a single player style quest with triggers that might work fine if it was part of a single player game, but with multiple players, each may disrupt the ability of the others to complete the process. Players are resorting to server hopping and repeating the steps as the only means of finishing, which tells me there is a problem that needs patching. Of course there are those who may be on a server where they are the only one going "quest" and can complete it without issue, but the fact remains that regardless of whether this was supposed to be an obscure objective, the quest triggers have not been adequately controlled for the multi-player environment, so I hope they will fix this and pay closer attention for all future content.
---
Yeah, when it comes to issues with the game they are kinda quick like day or less then a week, but when it came to getting my free 500 atoms for Power Armor Edition Nylon Bag compensation they approved it fast and said the bag would take months to get and the atoms would take few days. Ended up being 2 months before I got a message the atoms are in my account, funny thing they weren't it took few days for the atoms to finally arrive. So, if its game content they will give recycled unhelpful solutions or say they will tell their dev team but can't do anything ingame to help you; and if its anything outside that scope good luck getting help.
---
As a german I aprove
---
They seem to be mostly broken and randomized for me. I go to Camden park every day to try and trigger the fuzzy token daily‚Äôs; but a couple of times it has prompted ‚ÄúPowering up Posideon‚Äùwhen I load in to Camden. Makes me think the event triggers are scrambled to random map locations, or are simply totally broken. 
---
I wasn‚Äôt aware anyone actually thought this, I just thought people were shooting fire because it‚Äôs fun. Just like how nobody needs to stand on top of the bonfire and toss out the scared emote but someone always does. It‚Äôs just getting into the spirit of the event!
---
That said, I thought it was something the parade master did, I didn‚Äôt know a player had to do. I guess someone has always done that before I got to the bonfire to rain down fire on it. So thanks for that info! 
---
[had the same thing happen to me. No problems after the update, but two days later, I was suddenly in a bad spot.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b24u7y/possible_new_poi_after_update_camp_removed/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
I hit a guy after it ended
---
One swing of the hammer from behind, or two from the front.
---
How long does each parade last?
---
You're not going to get the benefits of your Unyeilding armor if you're wearing PA
---
This morning I also received only the Sausage Recipe as a single reward, other than this I have received a mask and second reward every other time (\~25 times)
---
Saw someone nuke it in the early days of the game.  Sadly, it was underwhelming. 
---
They need to buff nuke zones (fissure site prime and white springs being the obvious exception). Why is it that  nuking white springs and fissure site prime spawns hordes of enemies and loot while every other nuke zone is virtually dead? 
---
I think Ash Heap would just look so damn cool as a nuke zone. But loot wise there is no incentive. 
---
Come on Bethesda. 
---
I assume just dumb luck and random. I think I have 3  witch masks. Completely random drops. 
---
Yep. Needs fixin'.
---
I agree whole-heartedly. I hope they bring it back every year. I hope they can make other events like this, at least one a month I'd think would be a way to keep everyone coming back over and over. This is fun. This is cool. This is needed. IMagine if there was an event like this at Top of the World, etc. We need this. More please
---
Just get super irradiated and wear full unyielding set, because it seems at certain Charisma level the cheaper rates don't go any lower even if you take consumables or perk cards that effect charisma.
---
"please explain the wrecking ball perk."
---
 You deal ++% damage to WORKSHOP objects. 
---
Can you tell me where in the perk written description it says C.A.M.P. ? Raiders have always been kind it thick tho ;p 
---
Wanna nuke Helvetia go ahead! Have a blast! Overseer's log site alpha sums it up perfectly. 
---
Players like myself would have no problem with WORKSHOP PvP if it was contained to the WORKSHOP in fact I'd be more likely to participate. 
---
Certain campaign CAMP objects should not be able to be destroyed, looking at you rad showers. 
---
This is an issue with pve and Bethesda, not players like yourself, so go on out there and be a scummy waterhole raider, make your toon dirty, wear the raider armor full and proud! 
---
And if your looking for a truly "toxic" experience you should definitely join GTA5 online it is definitely the place for you.
---
Bessie creates a lot of poop, so it needs that 10 % space or else our bases will start to stink to high heaven!
---
I haven't even needed to repair my other X01 or T60 when using it except maybe once.  Y'all need to use the Perk cards for reducing damage.
---
Upvote for visibility. They need to reduce the weight with full thru hiker to .05. It's currently .1 and that's too much. Same with Stimpacks. There's no reason a stimpack should weigh more than a purified water or a can of dog food.
---
I'm honestly not far enough along to know who the ghoul faction is haha
---
Is that what that is? I kept hearing the same thing. Thought it was scorched or ghouls. 
---
The alien blaster, Level 50. It does 12 damage. Level 1 Two shot pipe pistol, 38 damage. Something seems wrong.
---
On a serious note, quad explosive double barrels, and TSE Combat shotguns were ridiculous before the nerf. 
---
I had no issues.  I run chameleon mutation and use vats for everything.  I downed the vodka, went outside, crouched and shot a ghoul, got my 2.5x sneak bonus and it finished that step of the quest.  
---
It was no big deal.  Almost every shot I take is a sneak attack, so I wasn't expecting it to be difficult.
---
holy crap ill have to check that out thanks for this heads up
---
#NUKE THE PARADE!
---
If you server hop with another player you can usually find the parade in less than a minute or two. I set up group chat on ps4 it makes it easier. IDK if other platforms have a similair option. 
---
So far I've been lucky and hit a few in the last few minutes. All the rewards none of the waiting. I'd say none of the work but it's an easy event with a long run time.
---
I know this doesn't help with DC's but there isn't much we can do about that.
---
Damn I'm still at level 15. I've been avoiding starting my motel business.
---
I've noticed this because I've been server hopping like crazy for the event. Im going to say that it isn't an issue with the update, but the fact that almost the entire player base is constantly server hopping to hit this event as much as possible.
---
I don't think he spawned at Whitesprings. I think he's complaining about not getting any Legendary drops.
---
Thought this too 
---
Pop some berry mentats and you can spot people doing this for easy caps ;)
---
I will only be happy with the rainbows if Let's go Sunning is added. 
---
It's not really the damage that is the issue.  Sure it would be nice if they did more damage as normally you think of them as end game weapons, but I get essentially the same level of damage out of a laser sniper rifle as I get out of my hardened combat rifle.  The main difference is the combat rifle ignores a lot of armor and thus remains viable (if not optimal) while the laser gun just feels weak.
---

---
All I know is that if you aren‚Äôt moving you can hear someone moving in many places as stuff starts disappearing, some 7 is most noticeable but other places as well! 
---
I thought ghouls or scorch as well...ha!
---
No they shouldn't, I agree but that's a different broken game mechanic. 
---
Server hopping definitely doesn't help, but it doesn't hurt as bad as it use to. 
---
When you get into a world wait 15-30 seconds for player locations to load and check your map and see how many are in Helvetia. If there are 3-4 people there then it most likely just ended, if not then I'd just play the game for a bit to see if the event triggers. Also keep in mind cool down is one hour from when it starts rather than when it ends.
---
True 
---
LOL.  Yeah, I've had to do that a few times myself.  People just shoot it with exploding bullets or grenade it expecting it to catch fire and no one goes near it.
---
I think 20 minutes at most
---
The simple fact of the matter is that the health on the Cargobot is ridiculous.  You could cut it in half and it would *still* be ridiculous.  And it goes without saying that the whole mechanic is unfriendly to melee players.
---
When I need to take one down, I use my goofy long-range shotgun of Doom along with Enforcer to cripple its engines.  Once I get it to stop, I can finish it off with my explosive Lever Action Rifle, but it still takes a good minute or two of standing there and launching 30-40 rounds at the stupid thing.
---
Even with that though, I still end up chasing it halfway across the Savage Divide or the Ash Heap.  Maybe it is a glitch that it just continues to move in one direction rather than circling you, but I'm about 50/50 on this.
---
Eh I always have fantasies of honey pot traps when it comes to online/social games and cheating, but never once has it actually been the case. Here's to dreaming.
---
She actually. But yea pretty much

THE COLORS MAN, **THE COLORS!!!!**
---
I'm curious what your LUCK is currently at on that character.
---
Back in the late 80s I drank so much of that shit. It was only like a fucking dollar. That and Mad Dog 20/20
---
That rug I had, really tied the room together
---
Yes. They did this on purpose, just to irritate you. 
---
It's a given in software development that any change has the potential to screw something else up, especially in an application that relies heavily on multiple large databases that interact with one another. 
---
Yes, in an ideal world QA would have caught this, but they are having to release patches at an unbelievably aggressive pace. 
---
I think that with your fragile temperament, it might be better for you to find something that won't create so much stress. Maybe Candyland. 
---
Waaaaaaa
---
Thanks. No shit.
---
And its she....

Nothing is stopping you from creating a guild that gives out quests and rewards. 
---
Farm the rewards. Write down quests. Have some friends or a discord guild...
---
I actually do this... The hardest part is "pulling" players to run your quests. If your charismatic enough, people will follow you and do your quests. 
---
Ive run players through quests at least 100 times. AMA if you need help. 
---
Five civil war top hats and 5 water, with the maxed vendor perk (I forget the name) will get me the full 200 caps per vendor. 1400 caps per day makes it worth it to me. :)
---
Dam, cause only headgears I have been able to get was ton of owl, tooth, soldier, 1 giant and 1 beret. The wiki lists a lot like sun, jester, and winter which I never seen on anyone. Still yet to get witch, goblin, and skull mask to drop. Wish we could trade in dupe masks to the robots to get tokens to buy the mask we are missing.
---
Maybe its just luck. I thought the disconnects were pretty much fixed. I haven't been dropped since the last big patch. Queen, parade, whitesprings nukes are all stable and fun again. Even with big crowds. We had a triple nuke, three queens in a row and all the adds that entails and easily 15 people there killing. Even loot circles were only happening once in a while, and would go away in a minute or two.
---
I‚Äôve spawned in there just after a nuke dropped and not in PA... I stopped leaving the game at WS after 2-3 times of that happening...lol
---
Typo on my part, should've been without.
---
Hopefully theres not too much of a gap
---
Yeah i was just thinking it might be june since the last Wild Appalachia is in may
---
I hated how they ditched this aesthetic in Fallout 4 as well, given how all the promo art featured the main protagonist with a rifle strapped to his back and a pistol as his/her sidearm. 
---
There was a mod that attempted to rectify it, and while cool, is was wonky as hell to implement and setup.
---
While we're at it, can the developers add proper showcasting to light sources. If nothing else, the Pipboy or power armor light should cast a shadow. 
---
shit i cut myself on that post, so edgy
---
I thought that was patched but I guess I was wrong
---
That would be awesome. Yeah I really want the goblin and skull but haven't seen it on anyone either 
---
Any 3 star Rolling Pin
---
Man, you're the type of person who *deserves* to be hounded all day long by griefers. 
---
I‚Äôd suggest checking your firewall. Mcafee broke my access when I renewed my mcafee AV. I tweaked the rules so that it allows all zenmax and Bethesda access to the ports.
---
That‚Äôs pretty disappointing, I like wearing the different masks I have with a suit, but the duty tan suit is just so dirty lmao. I‚Äôd love some nice suits haha
---
I don't see why the damn thing needs Vertibot guards, it's hardly fragile. Attach some laser turrets to it, and it could be the most devastating enemy in the franchise!
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one frustrated with it.
---
On Xbox as well
---
You don't even have to click on the thread to get information, it is right there as you scroll past. No interaction necessary.
---
Got the same thing after an disconnect.
---
It's okay though, 2 recepies and 2 times more XP :p
---
Why not join one of the many pre-existing servers and contribute to those communities, rather than try to create another server on the exact same topic and further split those communities?
---
Wouldn't a rainbow in this world be wild? I've heard sunsets and sunrises after a nuclear event would be out-of-this-world beautiful.
---
Definitely not complaining lol. Just thought it was cool/interesting
---
Where in the hell did you find a level 70 Glowing Wendigo? These won't spawn over a level 42 you might be mistaken on that.
---
Yeah, but I remember the 10k caps a day with fo4 .
---
I miss that shit
---
It's definitely worse on some server than others. It doesn't seem to be tied to number of people on a server, so there must be some other factor nobody has discovered yet. I noticed it right after the  update, but before the Fastnacht event started, so I don't think it's from the server load of the event running. Maybe it's dependent on everyone on the server having a good quality connection. I've been getting more disconnects the past few days than I did in the first two months playing the game. Every time it was that I was nearby someone else and we were both picking up items or interacting with the same thing. Last time it was the wood pile behind the hotel in Helvetia. Maybe the server has a problem when it can't tell who picked up an item first?
---
Probably 7
---
Should do the same thing to cola nut and good doggy, but then thru hiker wouldn't make much sense. 
---
The sad thing is I am going to do this.  Not for combat, but to get in position to view a damn pin on the maps around the world.  Under the wrong lighting conditions it takes forever to view a pin.
---
I'm on Xbox and have noticed a big increase in crashes that had been mostly resolved since the last patch.  Also spawning in seems to take much longer in general and enemies are attacking before you can even do anything about it. 
---
But it looks cool when the molotov hits at the same time it lights.
---
Chill dude, your badass is showing.
---
hey you dont have to be a dick about it geez
---
my respect for you just dissipated into the ether
---
thanks, but why does it effect every unitymedia user i know who plays the game? and why does it stop occuring if i simply quick connect to a VPN? I¬¥m pretty sure it¬¥s a specific this\_one\_ISP&lt;&gt;Bethesdaservers-thing and any other online service works perfectly fine for us since years
---
Probably was. I dont remember what level the Wendigo was so i assumed it was a high level.
---
Damn, thats an expensive investment. For sure tho 
---
&gt; Have you noticed that sometimes the Sloth loot is shared by everyone looting, not separate
---
I get this in Whitesprings occasionally as well. I will bash in a ghoul's head and very, very briefly see the legendary weapon/armor in its inventory before it disappears and the person next to me runs off.
---
This is not universal. I've done two parades in nuke zones and they completed just fine. Perhaps people had the materials saved before they started the event and were able to complete it that way. I had bees wax saved from a parade and was able to donate it at the next one. So maybe this is how to do it. But it CAN be completed in a nuke zone.
---
Yeah when the update went live last week, I got the same message on 3 different spots. It didn‚Äôt seem to recognise the conflict when I built, only after I had relogged and it had to spawn my camp in. Find somewhere else was my strategy, seems fine now. 
---
Part of your problem is low sample size.  This Reddit forum is hardly an accurate or substantial number of the actual player base.  I'm sure they're dropping, people just panic too easily when they think their 10-20 runs means they should have gotten something 'rare' already.  I'd like to point out the Technical Data quest, it's rare to get the BOS Shielded plan, Initiate Paint or other paints.  It happens, but you have to do it a LOT to have a real likelihood of getting one, and 10-20 attempts is not a lot.
---
Honest mistake. Though I do wish every enemy spawned at higher levels. Hopefully the upcoming nuclear winter allows this.
---
#SMASH ALL CAMPS AT THE PARADE LOCATION
---
I use a short scope to aim so I can still see while camouflaged 
---
rainbows would be awesome but other kinds of natural phenomena or weather would be super awesome!
---
I just edited the thing, Thanks for the clarification!
---
I remember doing a Scorchbeast Queen battle once where the Cargobot and its entourage just happened to show up.  I swear, instead of this wacky plan with the nuke silos, all they really needed to do was arm the Cargobots.
---
Am I missing the /s?
---
I JUST GOT A 2 SHOT EXPLOSIVE MASK!!!! WOO-HOO!!!!
---
My friend, you are preaching to the choir. I've been debating about going back to 4 just to build and hoard to my hearts content but I know the stack of caps will depress me.
---
Edgy? Maybe a game with the tag line ‚ÄúWar, war never changes‚Äù is a bit too dark for you. 
---
Yeah. I ran around in a blast zone most of the evening last night. Got a 2 star raider armor and a 1 star metal armor.  Neither worth more than 10 caps. Sometimes you get a 3 star junkie's walking cane. 
---
I personally think that awesome drops ought to be rare. 
---
Gather glowing meat and flux. You can buy something in no time. 
---
kay
---
How exactly? I have the max barter perk and sell way more than this
---
Just put in under your undies!
---
But will they stop after the event?
---
eh there's still lots of foods out there.  Maybe have it be on both but they don't stack, just overlap.
---
I MAY have took advantage of that and "charged" 30 cores...... 
---
Behold dear chinamen! No peeing on rugs in fo76! :P
---
YOUR OPINION ON PVP  &amp; SURVIVAL MODE IS HOT GARBAGE
---
Awesome!
---
Nope.
---
I loved finding the holotapes in Point Pleasant. So great.
---
+karma
---
Thank you very much, awesome dude!
---
I'd wondered about if it happens on console too. 
---
It's the perfect solution. Less likely to backfire, too. 
---
Bethesda should release a DLC where you remote control a weaponised Cargobot with all the HP and DR/ER.
---
You'd be unstoppable.
---
They should just expand the existing weapon customization feature...  maybe somewhat similar to Red Dead Redemption 2. Let us choose different colors / materials / decals for each individual part (stock, barrel, trigger, sights, etc) and make certain materials Atomic Shop exclusives (e.g. shiny chrome or clear).
---
Come to think of it - ALL the colors should also be sold in the Shop for a reasonable price. This would give players the option to either farm certain appearances (pay with their time) or buy them from the shop ( pay with their money).
---
The server I was on yesterday shut down for maintenance and I had to hop. Perhaps there was a hotfix applied a few servers at a time. Or not. Just giving some info. 
---
you right
---
Really appreciate all the great info! I'm just trying to get on a server with the event, hoping to get another mask soon but finding it incredibly difficult to find the event open! I want that troll mask ha ha!
---
OMG A RAINBOW RADSTORM WOULD BE AMAZING 
---
i got the same as devilfangs. the rest won't drop.
---
My friends said my head turned invisible after putting on the tin foil hat the other day 
---
Yeah, wear a two of the same headgear.
---
It's possible, but it would also be a really stupid thing to do in an event that's offered for a limited time.
---
I find it far more plausible that they coded a "Reward mask if a random number between 0 and 1 is &gt; 1" condition.
---
#While I have your attention Bethesda:
---
Half the legendaries at WS are still not dropping any legendary loot AT ALL. On the regular.
---
Damn chill out and eat some skittles 
---
Yeah, happened to me yesterday while (unknowingly) wearing the Beer Hat and one of the Fasnacht masks at the same time. Idk if the two are connected; it's just what happened lol.
---
Good luck my friend!
---
deal. message waviercomet7109
---
No. My irritation a players like this. 
---
Destroing someone's camp for something trivial like locked water pumps or because you don't like where they placed it is juvenile. 
---
I don't think he was confused about their existence but more that 3 perk points to be immune to alcohol addiction is an absurd cost.
---
wow, someone is in a bad mood, or just kind of an asshole in general.  
---
Confirmed. 
---
I like to be a floating santa beard.
---
Wow
---
I was at a parade last night that was all low levels, like 30 and under. So I just decide to hang back and not one shot everything. 
---
Goes fine until the end. Like you said, they all turn on the legendary and blow it away while the wolves come up from behind and kill all the robots. Event failed. 
---
Seriously!? That's the last time I let politeness get in the way of my fasnatch sun mask.
---
Not worth it after the patch
---
It dropped for me several days ago. I've already painted a few peoples sets in the officer paint.  I've dropped another 30 or so TD into the cache and no paladin paint yet.  I need to git gud at RNG.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I thought. 
---
well that makes me feel better - I'm an occasional player, LvL 25  and i'm constantly lost and bewildered by everything, lol
---
Or you‚Äôre going fart rainbows at me? :D
---
No idea. It's definitely an issue on their end. I'm on the East Coast and pay for a high tier internet connection. It's like night and day before and after the last patch. It's been a more recent, noticable issue. Imagine walking into a room and thinking "Jackpot" and soul crushingly watch everything one by one disappear. 
---
Does fire rate really increase how fast you pull the lever?
---
It isn't jist you OP. It takes forever for my camp to pop in. I would rather have this than unstable servers though
---
Well. Yeah that makes way more sense.
---
Only the devs have said that all the masks are in game and can be gotten.
---
Raining Radtoads could be a legit next step! Or you've meant hurricanes/tornadoes of somesort? Just imagine those flying Brahmin! Every time you build with the Barn-set there is a chance your camp will be picked up by some heavy blowing wind!
---
I use an SSD and I also experience this freezing but for only a few seconds upon joining a server.
---
No lol your good. You added some good original thoughts. You don‚Äôt need an explosive gun and most low levels don‚Äôt have one so yea just tag everything and they will finish it off
---
Will do
---
Yes, it does.
---
Every patch seems to bring with it a new quirk in loading.  The current one seems to be about dropping you into the world, freezing, then running in fast-motion for a moment.  And at some point, it starts spawning your CAMP into existence.
---
The idea that less might give different results was a misunderstanding. Someone went through the vod of the stream they got it from and they didn't say that at all - just that you should make sure all survive to not lose a chance at them.
---
Both devs and dataminers looking at the loot tables agree that number of robots doesn't matter.
---
Civil war top hats go for 35 caps on my build. 35 x 5 = 175. Then, the water goes for 5 per bottle/can. 5 x 5 = 25. There's my 200. I sell at the vendors/factions I have unlocked:
---
- both Watoga 
---
- Harper's Ferry 
---
- Pleasant Valley
---
- Whitesprings
---
- Enclave
---
- Flatwoods
---
I don't count Graham or the wandering vendor bot since it's rare I find them and I don't buy anything since I can find it in the world. The money gets used for trading with other players.
---
Sure, if you want 
---
Thanks for looking into this. I ran about 20 conincidentally (was just farming acid from the bee hives). This is a bit unrelated, but as far as datamining goes, do you have any insights on legendary spawns and drops? From my experience, it seems to be tied to the server - if a 3 star legendary spawns in an area, you're more likely to see a 3 star legendary spawn there again from that exact spawn point. But over time, if I reload that server over and and over, the chances of getting 2 and 3 star legendary enemies seems to go down significantly.
---
I'll bet this has more to do with it than the new content. Gamers are lazy. 
---
Because they're essentially benefiting from everyone doing the quest for them?
---
Or just weather in general 
---
I wouldn't leave such a good opportunity. 
---
I like using the All Rise legendary rocketed super sledge that you get after completing the mayor for the day quest in Watoga, then putting on a couple slugger cards and a couple blocker cards.  My guy is primarily a rifle build but can easily swap over to a pseudo-melee build with the swapping of a few cards.  Saves a ton of ammo when clearing out Watoga or Whitesprings. 
---
Datamined at 1% chance to get the rares. 
---
In probability and statistics, a Bernoulli process (named after Jacob Bernoulli) is a finite or infinite sequence of binary random variables, so it is a discrete-time stochastic process that takes only two values, canonically 0 and 1. The component Bernoulli variables Xi are identically distributed and independent.
---
If you do the event 100 times, you have a 63% chance to get 1 rare item.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_process
---
People need to stop strangling Bethesda with posts like this, you must remember that the people who are currently working on the game don‚Äôt deserve this shit, I wonder how you‚Äôd feel if every small mistake you made was retaliated against with vile hatred?
---
Let Bethesda breathe, think about the People who are working hard to try and fix the game.
---
That's cool, but it would make more sense to get this benefit with the alcohol perks.
---
Man I just realized I spelled Goblin wrong in the poll. Nice.
---
I've got one of those fancy monitors that has an optional green or red dot overlay in the center. Best thing ever for using heavy weapons that have crappy sights.
---
I did also. I completed the first one, but every time I fast traveled the second quest would change entirely. I was finally able to complete it by walking across the map to keep the quest from changing to something else.
---
Where do you go to farm TD?
---
Ok, so the method in talking about is pretty advanced and requires nuke zones. If it‚Äôs your first play through, I would just team up with a friend and use the perk inspirational 3 under charisma and do lots of quests, events, and Kill high level mobs (scorched are easy to kill and yield high xp). First play through I would enjoy it. Also, marsupial is a mutation you can get that allows your player to jump really high. I recommend it because you can get to places that melee attackers can‚Äôt get to and you can get yourself out of a bind with it
---
I‚Äôll take the skittles thanks. 
---
I believe the paints go up to elder. Heard about it from people who entered dev room. Now just trying to figure out which paints were released and which ones aren't.
---
Increasingly I think the gamma gun may be the best pvp weapon, against non-PA of course. With a deep dish and signal repeater, you should be doing close to 825 rads per second if you don't miss and they don't have rad resistance.
---
If you want to nuke I can do it for you if your on x box
---
It's not really stupid to offer different masks at different time for a limited event if some of those masks are supposed to be rare. So people that played it on Friday get it and others don't. That just means it's a lot more rare. I'm waiting till the end of the event to pass my judgement.
---
Any examples of which ones are bugged for you? Just curious for the same of cross referencing because since the patch I haven't noticed any issues and have been completing a bunch. Prior to fasnacht I was sitting pretty at 9000 without spending a dime.
---
I server hopped at Helvetia looking for a server with an active event group.  It took over 7 minutes of me standing in town for the Event decorations and NPCs to load.  Took over 3 minutes for the low level scorched to appear meanwhile I could hear them, see Danger/Caution, and was taking damage from them (minimal, non theatening, but still).
---
After 3 minutes and the scorched appearing, the Event itself started, and I had 5 minutes to talk to the Master of Ceremonies to begin it.  But the NPCs for the event and all the decorations still didn't load.  The timer was at 30 seconds by the time Master of Ceremonies finally appears and I could start the mission.
---
It gets really bad sometimes.
---
dang man, its a party! lets us have fun!
---
Enclave bunker, nuke silos. 
---
Where are you getting the 1% from? As well, the drop rate is likely calculated server side and values found in the game files are placeholders.
---
It goes with how so many of the Events are broken in one way or another.  It took until Patch 7 before someone finally did something about Protest March... and it's still lousy.
---
PS4: I ran into this trying to get the Nuka Quantum paint plan.  I'd get excited to see the plan just to have it disappear a few seconds later. :(
---
West tek. Robco, sugar grove. All the places of interest to the enclave.
---
It's mods and custom files. Unless you have been living under a rock since the last update, this is common knowledge.
---
i can get behind this, or even lower the cost of the perk, the chem one is 2 cost iirc and chems are stonger than most booze
---
They said they can be gotten. They didn't say on which days.
---
If its on purpose it would be for people to still do a populated event therefore making it able to be completed. 
---
Otherwise ppl would grind it day one then never go back to it potentially screwing latecomers/low levels from ever doing it.
---
Yeah mine only turns invisible when I have a Fasnacht mask on as well
---
They do. I dont know if sentinal or standard paints are available from the dev room list. I really want to get to elder and paint mine in that grey.
---
Yeah, assn/sentinel and pvp damage is out of control. You're either an unkillable god, or you get staggered and die instantly. In survival it's going to be all about the stealth bloody sniper builds that can one shot from a distance. I can't see any reason to play survival right now other than to lose caps, junk, and aid items.
---
&gt; Im going to say that it isn't an issue with the update, but the fact that almost the entire player base is constantly server hopping to hit this event as much as possible.
---
I'd be inclined to agree, but it did start appearing right after the Patch 7 update last week.  My CAMP takes ages to fully load, and when it does it is one individual piece at a time.  Turrets load first.  Then one piece, delay, second piece, delay, third piece, delay, etc. until my full CAMP is visible.
---
Only that bad on first joining a server.  After that it's a bit slow on fast traveling but not nearly that slow.
---
How many masks can you get? I did the event three times and only got two masks 
---
In the case of stimpacks, I can see why they made them heavier from a game balance perspective, they don't want to make it easier than it already is to keep popping stimpacks endlessly.
---
Alcohol provides a very small bonus for the perk card cost that make it viable.
---
Ok, I was just farming lead. Rare plans disappearing it's just wrong in so many levels.
---
My 9 year old sons camp has been there since launch day. I'd be so pissed if someone destroyed it just for fun. 
---
Yea, I was real happy to see all these strangers collect masks w me. These weren't ppl trying to get the next best weapon.. Just masks. Friendly interaction for a fun cosmetic. Also, not just A mask but a small series of masks.
---
I would bum around the map till it opened up again. Can u imagine the kind of fun we can have if they start implementing more events like this? 
---
Can we also talk about how it seems to increase the spawn rate of enemies?
---
I saw a Jester mask once.
---
yeah try server hopping the parade, every time i load in, the river has no water for like 5 mins, no robots appear for a long time, and even if the parade is happening, i cant tell for a long time
---
but, i figure it is just because there are so many people clustered up in a small space
---
It‚Äôs 10 porcelain steins.
---
That's kinda what I'm getting at. They may be giving out the rare masks later in the week so that people will continue to do the event for the whole time it's available. Rather than doing it for the first few days then no one doing it for the last few days.
---
I have a little camp to the south that consists of crafting stations and a stash. I put it there to help people 
---
I've never seen a robot go down since this started and have done almost every event while playing. I have been on every day for between 8 and 14 runs and have not seen anyone get any in the rare list. I have duplicates of all the common ones except the beret, just have one of those. As far as the plans go I have not kept track of the ones I received, wish I had.
---
Fun fact, I sold mine for 1000 caps
---
I did about 20 rounds. 
---
Most times we saved all of the robots, 2 or 3 times we lost just one. 
---
Each time I got a mask and a plan. Sometimes I‚Äôll get a random piece of armor too. 
---
The majority of the time I get a giant mask, but I have a few of each of the common ones and I also got the beret. 
---
I have both recipes. Just trying to get the rest of the plans that I don‚Äôt have. 
---
Already have paladin and elder.. 
---
FYI
---
Its not harassment until you hop servers and they follow. 
---
THEY ARE ALLOWED TO KILL YOU
---
Nice!  
---
As long as we're asking, (rioting??) For rainbows, can we get some unicorns too plz?? LMAO
---
I had this problem, it was caused by me having the master audio on like half, for some reason it makes the voice like unhearable... So I just cranked up master volume and loweres everything except voice.
---
Hope this helps
---
&gt; If you do the event 100 times, you have a 63% chance to get 1 rare item.
---
So by that, there should be quite a number of rares floating around already, with confirmed screenshots of the event rewards showing them, given the number of people game wide playing and repeating the event.
---
Initiate and Knight paint jobs are pretty rare from Tech Data, but enough people repeat them that we have confirmed screenshots of not only the item existing and being on a character, but where it came from.
---
yeees!! hurricanes tornadoes flying brahmin and heavy blowing wind seems cool but imagine more... like snow and thunderstorms or seasons
---
Very nice! I really like the hallways with your crafting machines and the pattern on the floor with the mats. I'm saving up to get that fish lamp and fireplace. xD
---
&gt;So people that played it on Friday get it and others don't. That just means it's a lot more rare.
---
It's a dick move if you insist that they are all available though, which Bethesda has continued to do despite a lot of evidence to the contrary.  If they literally pitched this as "A new rare mask everyday," that would be different.
---
&gt;If you do the event 100 times, you have a 63% chance to get 1 rare item.
---
if that were the case, the drought of evidence would literally be impossible. there have been millions of runs of this event and so far only 3 pics of sightings.
---
what datamine are you talking about btw? the one on the front page was done by the OP of this post, and it does not say a 1% drop. 
---
I did about 20-30 rounds (it‚Äôs spring break and I have no life). 
---
Anyway, most times we saved all of the robots, 2 or 3 times we lost just one.
---
Each time I got a mask and a plan. 
---
Sometimes I‚Äôll get a random piece of armor too.
---
The majority of the time I get a giant mask, but I have a few of each of the common ones now and I also got the beret pretty early on.
---
I have both recipes. Just trying to get the rest of the camp plans that I don‚Äôt have.
---
I'm not a professional drinker but I am all about reducing that stash weight. Were the carry weight to be reduced I may go after that perk!
---
There's a total of six masks that people are obtaining easily if one counts the beret. The other's are up to speculation as to if they are able to be rewarded. Time will tell if anything changes.
---
Professional work man. I truly hope that the rng will change with the masks, to make previous 1s low LVL and the other 1s now common so it rewards the people for playing all the days
---
Thank you man. I'll message you tonight and see if your on
---
Prison pocket! 
---
very interesting question. sorry I have no answer.
---
Whilst I have a better processor, that's more or less the same specs as my system, and that runs it just fine, so should be, yes. 
---
I think rare masks are a hoax. NEVER seen one drop. it aint even close to 1%
---
I really wish they incorporated the Pip-boy radio by having different stations work as a communication hub to funnel players into discussing trading, events, etc etc. 
---
Any photos?
---
I had 4 Initiates from before the update.  Just got a Knight yesterday.  I was curious if the rest of them were in there as well.  Guess I have something to look forward to.
---
Too bad it's only T-60...
---
Question: So with full assn/sent, if you get knocked down and someone repeatedly head shots you... you still won't die due to the damage reduction? I assumed at least 1 or 2 points of damage would go through.. enough to finish you off.
---
Yeah it makes no sense.  I'm pretty sure the addiction debuf is also only -1 CHR and -1 PER/INT (can't remember which).  That's not worth using 3 perk card slots to counter it.  They should change the Party Boy/Girl perk card to be tiered in such a way that max level gives you the addiction immunity.  Professional Drinker is basically unusable in it's current state.
---
Yeah shame the trim is white like the initiates and knights. If it was black oof. So much sexier.
---
...thats actually a thing ? Wow, I've literally never had that happen. 
---
&gt;Even if the rates were EXTREMELY low, I would imagine people making posts with pictures gloating when they luck out getting 1 of the rare 1s. Or we'd see people on the marketplace trying to trade their rare mask for the mask they really wanted.
---
I'm not saying that they do or don't drop, but, that's not really sound logic. Only like 20% of the playerbase of any game ever really engage outside the game itself (ie, go on Reddit, forums, etc.). 
---
So anytime you see polls or posts about what the community wants or whether anyone has found something or whatever, you have to keep in mind that the vast majority of players aren't ever going to see/respond.
---
What if the other 5 are locked intentionally for the second week of the event? and they plan on changing the numbers so the masks unlock. It would be an easy server side change that wouldnt require a patch.
---
Yup. Mine is to the left of vault 76. Have copper, steel, fertilizer, and water for all
---
It was a suggestion, not a mandatory action. 
---
A reminder, my Bethesda access works,  you asked a social media platform to make or compel a software manufacturer fix your problem.
---
I can‚Äôt comment on your isp, your vpn service or your desktop. You are responsible for managing those.
---
Finally, you personally know every unity user running Fallout 76? Lolz
---
Oh yeah. It‚Äôs bad ass. That and the mod for the extra bullet is fantastic. 
---
then all you need are the rare masks from Faschnacht and you have completed the end-game.
---
It really is just a huge resource drain. Personally I would be happier if when you died it moved you to a different server or something. The death penalty is a joke and the respawn timer is way too fast
---
wrong sub lol
---
Haven't been playing it for two months so yeah basically haven't been keeping up with the community either strange that a perk Loadout could cause that but whatever
---
ALL THE WAY
---
They said on stream that all masks are available right now. 
---
&gt; the one on the front page was done by the OP of this post, and it does not say a 1% drop. 
---
That's what I was thinking.  The OP here posted something about a secondary check on top of the first rare drop check chance that was a 1% chance.  But not sure if that was datamined or an example / guess?
---
I seriously doubt it. 
---
Ah lol, I am ze Reddit noob
---
Pretty sure it "reflects 50% of *melee* damage back at the attacker" 
---
oh...well then shit they need to fix that lol
---
Second week?  I thought it was only active for one week.  19th to 26th.
---
Yep im on pc 
---
I just think it's fun to throw a flaming bottle of gasoline at it.
---
What does elder look like?
---
Let's play my doggie, I'm finished at work in 18 mins 
---
Ah, lol, I am ze Reddit noob
---
For some reason i thought it was until the 29th
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm still having fun. Just wonky rewards that‚Äôs all. 
---
This is my thought.  OP wants to be invisible but have no downside, seems this was an intended consequence just like all other mutations have downsides.
---
The ones that are bugged for me are discover locations in the regions, probably due to me finding most of them during the beta
---
LMAO
---
Yeah I can throw up paladin give me a min
---
 Fair enough. 
---
Appreciate it, there is definitly something wrong that needs to be fixed here, regardless of how they do it.
---
Serious, actually. But sarcasm us one of my superpowers.
---
I‚Äôm not an expert, but with corresponding perks, the shots may be reduced enough that they are doing less than 1 damage and rounding brings them to zero. I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs not an exploit. It may be poor design, but that‚Äôs on Bethesda. 
---
What kind of idiotic response is this?  I suppose everyone should just grin and deal with the broken state the game is and has been in since release?  People have the right to expect the game to preform as advertised or at least to be playable. 
---
Definitely.  Hope to see better trading system updated along with the player vending update in the future.  Especially the "Bulk" price setting.  Without that, player vending of low cost high volume items like Ammo will be a no-go.
---
Thank you so much for the advice and i will enjoy it ive already  met so many nice people ! 
---
Why not just make more hats? I only sell hats and the stuff on me, but I‚Äôm not ambitious enough to hit all 7 vendor factions every day. I guess if you do maybe you might run low on cloth but I have a huge cloth surplus so it seems common enough to be all hats all the time ü§î
---
I think Bethesda is too generous with radiation. I.E. *gets hit by 1 low lvl ghoul, takes 15-20 rads* I feel as though the tad damage should be based on the enemy's level and not just a set number for all ghouls, I'm over level 100 and I've found myself murdered by phantom ghouls that I cannot target whatsoever after spawning near my camp in morgantown
---
Unfortunately for me, I came across this robot but the server disconnected me before I could interact.
---
I have found Knight/SGT/CPT/Officer. I guess I need to farm Paladin and now Elder
---
They said the mask SHOULD be available. However it seems they're not.
---
100% agree with everything. I wish I could trade things like fuel for cryo easier. 
---
In game txt chat should be a thing because people with disabilities would benefit greatly and that alone makes it worth it. Though some sorta of reporting system would need to be implemented. 
---
Thank you so much for the advice i will definitely  put it to good use . 
---
Server stability has been worse since the start of the Event though.  Patch 7 was pretty stable, if a bit slow on initial loads.  That's when the suspended accounts were restored.  Then the event released tuesday and the suspended players report they are suspended again, and the servers are acting worse.
---
So, the suspension / unsuspension of the players appear to be having no actual correlation to server stability...
---
Not the Gjallarhorn, think about skolas‚Äô children!
---
Wait, what‚Äôs ‚ÄòOfficer‚Äô paint look like? I‚Äôve never heard of/seen the Officer tier before.
---
they will increase in value over time. 
---
Will go great with the canned coffee I live off of.
---
Me and my character are drinking Old Grandad. Everything's working jush fiin. \*urp\*
---
The Megasloth in the event becomes unlootable (corpse actually freezes) for my Teammate 100% of the time until it decomposes to a meat pile.  Others report the same problem.
---
Seems it may be related to the general server instability happening at the moment.
---
Okay great. If u need help with some outfits I can maybe help
---
I thought there was one confirmed in another post?
---
I do 6 top hats and 2 water. So close to my method!
---
Spoken like a true corporate heel.  Keep up the good work being the champion for the poor poor company that has been unfairly attacked by all these evil consumers. How dare they expect the game to work as advertised, or to work at all.  
---
Do you normally do just one at a time? Since they don‚Äôt stack
---
I was talking about me and my social environment who have the same speccs and issues. I also wrote that I can play the game perfectly fine now and that I‚Äôm just reporting something which seems to be an issue. How many beers you already had today? 
---
Whoa, R u a psychic? 
---
I‚Äôve noticed this too. I can watch my camp appear one piece at a time above me (it‚Äôs a tower base). I can run over to the junk extractor, empty it and run out before the foundation walls appear, but if I‚Äôm too slow, I have to wait for the pressure plate to appear so I can open the door to get out. 
---
everyone in clan sets same profile image.
---
Same for my other character. He‚Äôs over in the mire just north of Harper‚Äôs ferry. There‚Äôs crops, purified water and junk for all who find him
---
I think the decrease in stability has more to do with all the server hoppers, myself.  As players slowly get bored of Fasnacht, it seems to have leveled off a bit.  But there was a point where the server population was all over the place.
---
No, he said it rolls a random number between 0 and 1 and if it's 1, you get it. 
---
Maybe someone who knows statistics can correct me on this, but I think it would also be helpful to know at what number the engine rounds the random number. If it was whole numbers, then there would be a 50% chance of getting one. If it's to 2 decimals, then you have a 1 in 100 chance. So as far as we know, it could be 1 in 1,000 or 1 in 10,000 or worse.
---
Because you won't get the full 200 if you sell only hats to a vendor. 25 caps would be left behind. As for ambition, it takes about 30 minutes to sell to the 7 I listed. Cloth is easy to get so there's no worries there.
---
Great minds and whatnot..lol.
---
It's primary is gun metal, the secondary is orange. 
---
Yeah, I killed the space alien 20 minutes ago near my base. I just checked and it was a meat pile. I was able to loot, thanks.
---
in real life or in the game ? 
---
Damn dupers making the servers unstable.....
---
Tell him i sent you. ;)
---
Is this your first MMO?
---
Rare drops are a thing, welcome to MMOs.
---
nearly black gunmetal with red accents on the arms and torso.  Looks identical to paladin sans the rank insignia on the left arm. it's probably the best looking of of the paint schemes.
---
Figured I‚Äôd get insulted, but idiotic? No.
---
If you have a job I bet you‚Äôd expect people to treat you humanely, well think about the people working on this game, being treated like shit by fans.
---
All I‚Äôm saying is, instead of being angry and trying to burn Bethesda, try thanking them for there hard work and suggest the things that need fixing.
---
What‚Äôs idiotic is expecting Bethesda too change all the bugs and glitches in a week, what‚Äôs truly idiotic is expecting someone to work harder because you insulted them, clearly there‚Äôs a few ways to handle this and your taking the toxic approach.
---
Can I air strike it?
---
I've observed the exact same behavior right after the last patch. It is annoying to load into a building, go to pickup stuff you readily see, and then two minutes later it finally updates and the area is already looted. I didn't take long before.  Now it's ridiculous.
---
Legendary spawns on one side, to distract you from the wolves and stingwings that spawn on the other side. It's a good ploy on the devs part. If you're obsessed with legendaries you will be punished with a failed event.
---
whiskey river, take my mind...
---
sorry, the last bit reminded me of that song, would be kind of interesting to hear on the radio in Appalachia
---
I found a level 50 Bloodied Power Fist that has three modifiers on it. It deals more damage when at low health, more damage with low resistances and ignores 50% of armor. When at about 30% HP and about 100 protections it hits for 884 while using the Iron Fist perk. Capable of ending most normal enemies in a single blow. I do not have the Talons mutation yet. 
---
If you really want to??
---
Better yet does TS Increase the rads ??
---
Hoarders absolutely have something to do with server instability. Many of the unbanned users got a bot too comfortable and decided to keep their stuff instead of destroying it. Hope re-ban fixes some of the issues. 
---
Used to sell them for 400, then dropped it to 300. Lately I‚Äôve been doing 200 per if people buy 3 or more. 
---
There is a Lemonade vendor that appears at random event locations (North East of Fort Prickett is an easy one to farm).  It sells the Lemonade and Hard Lemonade recipes.
---
Other than that, you get mixed drink recipes randomly from Biv as part of the daily repeatable quests.
---
You can also buy them from players directly if you find someone to make some.  Or a chance to find them for sale at a vendor which another player sold some to already.
---
Unless it's been changed they don't actually drop the ammo. It does appear on their corpe but I've tested it thoroughly and no ammo actually transfers to your inventory when looted. Great way to farm cores though.
---
Agreed. But even if I'm wrong. If the masks ARE in the event. Think about the low percentage it was to get a jumpsuit from an event, and that's not even a timed event. I've played this game hundreds of hours and not gotten 1. Now think about the amount of posts that went up, in the beginning, before duping, for jumpsuits. With not 1 post on Reddit, it means the percentage chances are completely f'd up. I'm all for, making it so you need to grind a bit, I'm all for it not being so easy, that you'll get all of the masks. 
---
But for a time sensitive event, for me to grind till I blow my brains out, and don't even come close to getting 1. 1! That's just f''#$d up.
---
pretty sure it wasnt the patch, but when they rebanned players, but as we cant know for sure, ill just have to use my anecdotal evidence of how the timing coincided
---
For me, seems like I get better legendary weapons in Watoga, like they have more 3* legendary enemies vs whitesprings.  Try the 3rd floor of the Civic center and then 2nd floor of the medical center, behind the barricade.  Seems like a 50/50 chance of a 3 star enemy on every play.  
---
But I would think that we would see someone wearing one. People tend to wear masks that are more uncommon or ones that not everyone else is wearing for that event. If I got a new mask, I would definitely be wearing it during the parade.
---
It's frustrating to think that someone spent the time to design, texture, and code these other 5 masks and only one person might get any of them. Waste of resources.
---
Yes, but in those MMO's you can run the event forever, not just a ridiculously short period for the non-zero chance of getting one. Non-zero is a maths term for "may as well be 0".
---
How often does the event start?
---
Basically all of the "Discover locations within X" challenges are broken for me. I've been playing since launch and have been to pretty much every POI on the map many times over, but even some key locations like the Asylum, Top Of The World and the Waterpark are still not checked off. I'm having this issue on both PC and PS4
---
Considering the mire events has a 0.02% chance to drop event outfits, I am not surprised if this is the case too.
---
* There should be like two boxes in the middle of the trade interface that show items being selected for trade.
---
* You flag "requested" items in the other person's inventory. They can select items for trade. And any items/caps that are selected are listed in your "offered" box.
---
* Once both players have their offers, they click a "confirm".
---
* If ANYTHING in either person's offers section changes after you confirmed your side, "confirm" automatically cancels and you have to click it again. This should prevent any sudden changes to try and screw someone over. 
---
In the wasteland, there should be more than one way to light a bonfire.  If a Molotov or a fire damage weapon can't start a fire, but a click can, that's just silly.  ;P
---
&gt;I think the decrease in stability has more to do with all the server hoppers, myself.  
---
Bethesda's terrible RNG is partly to blame for this.    They devised a system where the most wanted plans/ masks that are rarely rewarded.  What exactly can you expect to happen?   
---
Same goes with mods and paint jobs. 
---
I've been trying to get at least one of the new BOS paints for the T60.   I spend an hour or so going to every single location on one server getting techincal data and turning it in, and I don't get one paint job. Once all the locations are exhausted in one server, then hopping to another one is  the only option. 
---
The only one i have is the lemonade one- i bought the recipe for lemonde and the mixed drink originally from the lemonade robot vendor that can spawn at Charleston station, and i've since got a second copy as a reward for the daily quests that give you recipes from Biv the drunk robot.
---
Unfortunate the last time we tried server hopping it took an hour to get all of us back on the server (pebkac error). He‚Äôs sort of special needs. He was a server tech but an accident left him impaired. I got him an xbox hoping playing games again (he use to play all the time) would help rebuild so if those lost synaptic connections.  I have to talk him through server jumps every single time. I also have to talk him through fast traveling every single time, and he still can‚Äôt use vats, or trade, or build, or anything else. Sometimes it will take him 20 min just to figure out how to accept a team invite. I wish I could hook up some sort of side controller with macros for him. 
---
If you can upload photos that would sort of work.  I would much prefer something that could have a clan title added. Most online games I've played have this. It's not ground breaking or anything
---
I'm not talking about having the old Fallout 1 and 2 to be ported into the consoles which would be nice and interesting. But I am talking about the Classic Combat Armor. The guy above this comment basically said that the Classic Combat Armor should be added to be paid on Consoles while PC should get the item for free and brag about how PC is better than Video Game Consoles. I replied that Nobody should play Favrites between the gaming console and built-in PC gaming system. I am not quite sure what's this about and the sudden downvotes as well?
---
Ya, for me, Patch 4 to 6 were great, no disconnect or crash gameplay.  Patch 7 is a definite step back in terms of stability, even though we are finally getting new content...
---
I'm inclined to believe the stability issues are due to the introduction of new content.  The existing content Beth had months to tweak and fix to make stable.  So I'm not optimistic about the next month or two as we are getting a drip feed of new content every week it seems.
---
the server issues resurfaced the same day those that were banned were unbanned, not the event.  All my teammates noticed it.
---
but you are entitled to your opinion, as i am to mine.
---
a post here int his sub from a friend of a banned duper shows a message from Beth support stating explicitly they attempted to unban the players and monitored the server stability afterwards, and they came to the conclusion that they needed to reban them as it had direct correlation to the instability.
---
ill try to find that post again
---
I am not going to say you have no idea what you're talking in your experience with the game but your comment is laughably naive in response to the current state. 
---
And by current stare I mean in it's immediate future. I agree that Fasnacht is cut content but when you say "it'll be dead in a few weeks" ? It shows you no little to nothing. First of all the event is a week long event, not that I don't think people will get bored of it before then (unless they're dripping out the rare masks over the course of the event)  Second this is the second content release (not update, this content was included with the first content. Just not activated until this week) they have done in 2 weeks. This is the second release of 10 that they intend to drop over the next 3 months, the third release being next week, 3 releases in 3 weeks. Of course then we have a 2 week gap between the next as 10 releases over 12 weeks isn't enough for one every week. Once again, all content was included in the initial update. 
---
However this leads right into the announced summer update which will lead into the announced fall update, So this is the type of support Bethesda is offering, sure we only have a vague motion of what summer and fall will hold and some of the content is completely shallow but there are things I am looking forward to. 
---
To give you an idea, next week is a separate fully open pvp mode and 2 more quests that I am hoping will be more in depth then Biv's. That's just for the spring, in the future updates, there'll be a nuclear winter mode that I am interested in,  legendary (prestige) player characters and a whole new story line. 
---
So your reply as if Fasnacht was the only thing Bethesda has released/ was releasing is laughable. 
---
Platform?
---
PS4 sorry forgot to add.
---
I was actually told that certain rare outfits are exactly a 0.03% drop rate. 
---
I run that data quest on average 5 times a day and get one of those plans at least every day. That is not an accurate comparison to this event.
---
I got it through scrapping non legendary versions I believe, just took a while.
---
It's genuinely funny that actual, no BS super-rare stuff that hasn't been duped to hell and back pisses people off now.
---
wow thanks for the positive feedback!
---
OK so I've tweaked the build according to your advice...now how does this look?
---
 [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=8c444f9&amp;d=e00c72ic3ar2an2ao0a51ah0lb0pc2sd0su2so0sp0as2l71p02sb1pd0pk0pp2pl0e82lv2lr2a31&amp;w=&amp;n=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=8c444f9&amp;d=e00c72ic3ar2an2ao0a51ah0lb0pc2sd0su2so0sp0as2l71p02sb1pd0pk0pp2pl0e82lv2lr2a31&amp;w=&amp;n=) 
---
I focused more on developing two specialist weapon lines, i.e. shotguns and rifles, specifically using VATS for stealth kills.
---
I can't find a perk that reduces rifle weights...is there one?
---
Wouldn't it be nice if the devs actually played on the real servers, they only use the inhouse ones to test stuff on.
---
it was in the stations on the wall i believe
---
You have to place it in your CAMP.
---
I'll take the whole prison of elders with me if i have to!
---
Pictures are great and all but I want to see a clip of the mask actually being awarded. Until then I think your assessment of their being some issue with the drop rate is correct. Thanks for the work on this.
---
You need people for a riot
---
I‚Äôd love to check out your camp when I‚Äôm on later today! 
---
Train stations?
---
How is it a dick move to not tell everyone how to get the rare masks...
---
Ya that was a problem last night, as the place got nuked before enough intestines were gathered.  
---
Someone had already put in 3, I had 5 left over from a previous parade...but 8 was not enough....
---
So the event failed.
---
Results are in, I may be colorblind
---
Yes that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to do but it‚Äôs not in the things I can build.
---
Yep, hang it on your wall
---
It doesn't look that much but it does look cool and sci-fi like Fallout 1 and 2 did.
---
This is funny because I‚Äôve yet to get a single toothy man mask. Lots of giants, witches, and soldiers, and a few owls but that‚Äôs it. I may have an extra balloon or 2....
---
That‚Äôs what I was curious about...they nerfed TS from 100 down to25% but on the Gamma specifically did they nerf the 2nd shot of Radiation?  If not it would seem like a TS w/ faster fire modded to auto would be devastating. 
---
Any train station has them
---
Its alot more common than that. Maybe dont rely on the internet. Or how about dont believe everything you read?
---
Aside from the irritation of tracking down intestines, doing the parade while nuked is a nice change of pace.
---
Here is the problem with it from a Raider RP perspective though.  You "The Raider" do not gain any benefit aside from the "Hahaha I made your life more difficult" satisfaction.  
---
Did you make any attempt to Ransom Helvetia to other players?  Pay me Caps, Ammo, Food to NOT Nuke Helvetia?  Are you sure you are really RPing if you didn't try that?
---
Can non-Raider players do anything from an emergent gameplay perspective?  
---
Did non-Raider players have any means of preventing the Nuke launch?
---
Professional drinker has no effect on a lot of the new alcohol drinks 
---
THE EVENT IS NOT OVER YET. 
---
The drop rates could very well change over the next few days. If it ends and something was bugged to make it so that no one got one, then I'm sure there will be some sort of reperation for the bug. 
---
800 caps per mutation is exceptionally expensive. I will probably just pay 200 caps to one of the dozens of other people spamming the trade subs everyday. 
---
There's like 17\~8 possible mutations in this game. It would be absurdly op if it stacked
---
What type of weapon you looking for? If you want a tse you can check player markets and just put up a post and you could snag one for 3-6k caps there are a ton of them out there, however stuff like bloodied and anti armour explosive is a bit harder to come by. 
---
It's under "Wall Decor".  Go down to the Mothman Poster, and select Left, the Party Poster is in the same "Variant" menu as the Mothman Poster.
---
It took me like 10 minutes of combing through all of my items to find it. It's not a top level item-- it's grouped with one of the Mothman unique decorations.
---
Yeah, I recently got in a debate with someone who had a second character holding over 5,000 lbs of stuff so they could set up shop when "player vending" comes out. Their only argument was that the dupers were worse and are the real problem. IMO the only difference is hoarders don't intentionally crash servers
---
I don't believe it is since it was my first mask to be awarded. 
---
It's under decorations. It will have an Atom shop icon on it, so it's easy to spot. Toggle craftable objects to find it easily.
---
I've had nuked ghouls at harpers ferry- all glowing ones but nowhere near as many as Whitesprings.
---
How many caps do you have I have enough tokens to get a couple outfits
---
grab a friend who hasnt done the quest for tech data or any BOS quest at all, get him to pick up any and all tech data, go to camp venture, trade and complete quest, repeat
---
I agree man totally, nuking something like a power plant should cause some kind of reaction like at least a bigger nuke zone or something
---
And anyone who wants to sell any of the non plain ‚Äúknight‚Äù plans on Xbox and make a killing, let me know 
---
For me I like queen killing and heavy guns. I use all the heavy gun perk cards maxed out including stabalized. My weapon of choice is my furious explosive prime 50 cal.
---
I havn't played for 2 months or so and came back for this event and was thinking the overall game performance was worse then it was at launch. 
---
I had a 2shot explosive assaultron head. Does that count? So pissed off at the best roll on the worst gun in the game!
---
He meant giving Fallout 1 and 2 for free to console users, because people on PC that played 76 in the first couple weeks got those games for free. Sorry you misunderstood that comment and  its meaning. 
---
Can confirm as I did it today but if you go to dyer chemicals when the heart of the swamp event is going on there will be strangler blooms. I have NOT completed the quest but I didn't have it active. Once the event was gone I couldn't get anymore after I left that server.
---
Honestly though almost all the booze isn't worth it other then whisky because of the strength boost and it doesn't take anything you can't grow. 
---
I've stopped wasting my ammo after ~50 runs and just let the group finish it for me. The cost of repair and grinding for mats to replenish the ammo is prohibitive to this being fun anymore, but my OCD won't let me stop till at least one rare mask(hopefully goblin or sun) and all the plans + both recipes.
---
well lets even out this disparity!  :)
---
Name your price 
---
No, it's just "if you are mutated" not per-mutation.
---
Lol that means... 
---
The variable i was using was (1/100) which would have to be replaced with ((1/100) / 1/100)) or something else depending on how rounding works.  Maybe 1/2 over 1/100 if it rounds to where 51+= 100 or (1). 
---
Which makes the odds way way worse. 
---
/takes notes for his "ultimate boozehound" build in development
---
It‚Äôs suppose to be inside the building if u got ghouls in the area then you get a horde bigger than in the golf club.
---
True but wouldn't that be out of place since it was just called Combat Armor in Fallout 1 and 2?
---
Now I'm going to shoot it even harder. 
---
Use a machete or something. The enemies are soooooooo easy! A direct hit from the suicides does barely any damage to me. 
---
I‚Äôd love to help you. I‚Äôm at work for the next 6.5 hours so I can‚Äôt until then. I‚Äôm down then though, no worries!
---
I swear I saw someone wearing Old Man Winter in the last event I did last night, but I didn‚Äôt think to take a pic.
---
I‚Äôve been wondering though, if (aside from the usual RNG) if the mix of robots you get has anything to do with it. You don‚Äôt always get the same five, and they each have their own mask. Maybe that has something to do with what spawns/the chances of it spawning?
---
... yet.
---
Stay inside vualt 76. Only way.
---
That's what i heard
---
This is exactly why I specifically used idiotic. Bethesda does not need you as a champion for them. They need to fix the pice of crap they over hyped and sold to all of the franchise fans as well as first rime wastelanders. Your logic is just broken. 
---
So continue to champion for this poor little company that is unfairly being picked on by teenagers that have saved up $60 (or more) only to be slapped in the face with this soggy wet turd of a game.  
---
People like you are why the video game industry has adopted these scummy practices. There‚Äôs always some idiot out there willing to blindly defend them rather than accept the fact that this soggy wet turd is no better than flaming garbage wrapped in trash and thrown in a gasoline soaked dumpster......yes a dumpster fire. 
---
&gt; no BS super-rare stuff
---
"No BS".  But currently that's the issue.  If it existed, but was just rare, it'd be one thing.  But currently right now we can't even tell if they exist.  And we have a finite amount of time to find out if it's just a "super rare chance" or if there is some method to get them to drop or such.
---
Ah. I'm on Xb1 but I'm happy there are other "mermaid men" running around. 
---
I need one for Biv's daily. QQ
---
Ok, where are they?
---
I'll keep that in mind. That's another thing I don't do very often. 
---
Wow, so you leveled all the way up to 117 on launch?  Sheesh, that‚Äôs amazing to do all that in one day.  Good job!
---
Ahh okey dokey. Thankyou and yes it would be absurd with all 18(ish)
---
Go play Anthem. Go play ANY other game. 
---
You'll be much happier. 
---
I had no idea there were more than four! I‚Äôve always gotten the musician, candlestick maker, butcher, and decorator. 
---
Thanks for making this list. 
---
Yes, I know. I only noticed that a few hours later, and I dont know how to change :(
---
What's a tse? Two shot explosive?
---
Well I sell my tokens for 20caps each 450 tokens works out to be 9k so I can either go grab a outfit or I can sell you the tokens and you can get it. Either way works for me
---
Yeah give us rainbows or we'll trash Helvetia!!!
---
Oh wait... 
---
I'm sure there is a market for them but worst case scenario if you are still hopping around use them when needed. 
---
All it does currently is make it so you can keep drinking and not get addicted.
---
Perhaps you were thinking of Party Boy/Girl which doubles or triples the effects of alcohol?
---
I can haz war steins?
---
Is the loading time into server faster and they lazy load more stuff afterwards?
---
Great! I need to get one
---
If you put it on does it blow your head off?
---
From what i have heard, no
---
I have no condolences. If you cheat, get banned, then on top of it get a second chanx and cheat and get banned again.... It's your own damn fault
---
Well I can't get these darn rare masks after 40 or so runs but I do have both paint you mentioned. 67 runs completed so far
---
Oh yeah, those Mr gutsys and Sergent gutsys melt me even in PA I use a few different melee weapons and my Tse gauss rifle. 
---
Me and a another player had the same thing happen, just 2 of us ran the event, finished it with 20 seconds left and both got duplicate common masks and plans. The toothy and owl seem to be the most common of them for me. I see high priced rare masks coming to your Ebay soon.
---
we need manequins to stall our clothes on. i would not sell the barret. people can come visit my house and pay to see it :D
---
Oh I had an AAE 50. My heavy weapon of choice is the LMG and no power armor.
---
awesome! im also at work, should be on later in the evening though!   
---
Especially with only several years of development and God knows how many millions of dollars.
---
Rare drops are ok but not in a one week limited time event. Then it's not rare, more like hit the jackpot in the lottery. 
---
But the caps are nice
---
So I go to dryer chems at night time which is when the strangler blooms glow and show up any other time you go there is a waste
---
if you are on Ps4, you are welcome to any toothy mask my man
---
reddit won't send this with more then 3 tags, it's a spam filter
---
I friggin love the buff to that gun :)
---
I don't suppose there's any chance you still have this shotgun for sale? Sorry I disappeared on you. Haven't been on the game in week due to work and other conflicts.
---
There is always that one cool guy that just has to try to sound cool..  and fails.
---
I see where you are coming from, because early on a lot of the people I met would be softly mulling over a conundrum to themselves which I would then verbally answer, which would result in surprise and adventuring together. A few of which I still play with.
---
That said, as other have mentioned, it‚Äôs not without its cons. Because for every one person with a good mic commenting on the environment around them, there‚Äôs another guy with a laptop mic they don‚Äôt even realize they have coughing loudly with the sounds of domestic abuse behind them.
---
Add beret for pool
---
If we can have *Bots on a Parade* then we sure can have *Bots on a Riot* as well!
---
You can have 3 brahmin in a workshop. 
---
Take over the homestead. Nobody ever takes it and there is plenty of razorgrain to make the cows for free. 
---
It wouldn't be devastating it would be an appropriate counter to bloodied sent/ass builds, wich should have a hard counter. Got absurd damage and defense ? Get melted by rads, very fair play 
---
I find that hard to believe that you get one a day.  
---
Reminds me of that one guy who taped a magnifying glass to his monitor so he can get headshots from far away with a pistol.
---
Will you be on anytime between 9pm-midnight US Eastern? If so, I'd like to buy 5 off of you.
---
That "front page post" you are getting the info from was made by the OP of this thread.  The odds weren't 1 in 100, they were either 0% chance if the range is \[0.00 - 1.00) (exclusive 1.00) or a non-zero but effectively 0% chance if the range is \[0.00 - 1.00\] (inclusive 1.00), note that that would not be 1 in 100, that would be (approx.) 1 in 16777216 (or worse).  Also there's an easier formula for calculating the drop rate for repeated trials, it's just 1-.99\^50 (99% chance of not getting the item over 1 trial and a total chance of 36.6% chance of not getting the item over 100 trials \[then do 1-36.6% for the chance of getting it\]).
---
I think their just bolstering the market and Ebay sellers.
---
Sounds good, I need 350 tokens, PSN MrsPrepper, I'll be off and on majority of today. you're awesome!
---
I have had waking dreams where I nuked comic sans...
---
They should ante it up and add more robots to the parade, especially more variety (Sentry Bots, Assaultrons, Eyebolts). All with masks of course
---
Prior, the devs raised the stash capacity
---
They also raised the stability in the same patch
---
Yet people assume it's item quantity that mess with the stability rather then assuming people who delivered cheap ass preorder items also got themselfs servers of the same quality on a game that's bugged as hell and may as well be spamming random, unnecessary data on the servers... seriously, this ban glorifying needs to stop. There's nothing good about banning people over stuff that should've been fixed months ago.
---
BURN HIM! BURN HIM! BURN HIM!
---
It's good to separate the PVE &amp; PVP servers
---
Never played WOW?  Know how many times people have had to grind the Halloween event to get the Headless Horseman's Mount?  Took me three years of running that week long event to get mine.  As I said, welcome to MMOs. 
---
They actually ignored that most people wanted a fresh start with new characters only. Fuck that, it sounds awful. 
---
I've done the event three times.  All three times I got a witch mask.  I have a feeling that tonight I will get another witch mask.  Uh, anybody on xbox need a witch mask?
---
Ok I‚Äôll add you now 
---
No, I haven't gotten any yet. I live in Pacific Coast Time, I can probably get on around 8 PM (PC Time) if you want to trade. That's just my optimum time though, if you can't get on at that time then we can work something out. Do you want one of the masks I said I have or do you want to sell it for caps?
---
Oddly enough, after I built my moo moo I've noticed less enemies
---
Did devs make their game so poorly they have to set up weird in game traps to even be able to catch people generating items? 
---
Definitely love that
---
do a google reverse image search and look for the oldest posting of the pic, it may be one from before the event even started. Those masks were grabbed from the dev room and posted.
---
yeah 100-300 is the typical rate. feels like it should be more, but that's the market.
---
This is what I was getting on to say. 
---
I always put a few explosive rounds into the fire. 
---
It's a fun event. Have a little fun with it. 
---
And its hilarious to watch people stand too close to their own bombs that dont realize that just because you can't hurt other people doesnt mean you can't blow yourself up. I take their junk with absolutely zero remorse. 
---
I will be on but probably not until 11 eastern.  I'm going to a birthday concert at 7pm.  It's JS Bach's birthday.  If he'd lived he'd be 334 today.   ;)
---
Hey if you have anything in that massive stash you don‚Äôt want... ;)
---
This was an excellent post backed by useful information based on pertinent data collection.   Outstanding sample size too.  
---
Two thumbs up for applying Statistics to the wasteland!
---
I thought it was activated by lighting it on fire with weapons.  It makes sense that it doesn't work that way, but I'm still going to continue shooting it with explosive weapons for fun. 
---
This new survival mode sounds so nice üî•üí¶üëå
---
I should've thought of that I do remember one of their gamertag but I'm probably not allowed to post it here 
---
I've had a similar issue with the wood pile.  Pilfered it Tuesday evening, and it hasn't refilled for me since, despite server hopping.
---
What outfits?
---
And that is why there should be a mechanic, not to recharge, but consolidate them. Four 25%er dropped in, one 100%er drops out. Has the clutter clearing effect Bethesda seems to be all about &amp; you get to free up 9 lbs of weight, while keeping to power. Win/win!
---
Yeah, like I said, I'm not trying to say that they do or don't drop. Just pointing out that a poll with maybe a couple hundred respondents isn't really definitive of the experience of a couple million or several hundred thousand or whatever players.
---
I think it's -1 Charisma and -1 Agility, but yeah who the hell is gonna waste 3 Special points for that. It should be 1 to be any good, and even then it would be very niche. 
---
It's in the train stations on the cork poster boards 
---
I found them very easily after the Organic Solution quest, but it is much easier at night.  Just look up and down the river and look for glowing spots in the river.  I found like 6 of them right after the quest and found more later on.
---
This was a while back though so there is a chance that a patch broke something between then and now
---
Not if you are using the other alcohol perks. It takes away the only real negative they have.
---
I am going to build an acoholic junkie build. Junkie armor, weapons, alcohol perks but no Professional Drinker. Stay sauced and dangerous. I think with a Junkie Shotgun and whatever shotty perks I can add it would be pretty fun and dangerous.
---
It has been theorized that the Overseer's questline is still active as a hook to future DLC.
---
Just go pacifist mode and you don't need to worry
---
Happened to me too. But the second one required me to kill something with a melee attack. I did it over and over and it would never complete. Tried with fists, one-handed, and 2-handed. Nothing.
---
Thanks man, Queued....lol
---
Bummer I'm sorry. Maybe it's because I've never complete the quest. 
---
Civil war era suit doesn't look bad.
---
Just got the burning man effigy. And a sixth witch mask. But well... effigy keeps me warm at camp :)
---
Yes please!
---
While I don't have interest in PvP or this new mode  myself, this sounds like it will be fun to watch Twitch streamers tackle this.
---
There's other ways to get water... like building your own purifiers at your own camp lol. I fail to understand why you feel entitled to other peoples' resources. That being said I don't lock my purifiers as they produce more than I consume and I don't really sell purified water.
---
Why didnt I think of this!?!?
---
Yes
---
https://twitter.com/deadrabbitgirl/status/1108747188170092544?s=21
---
I‚Äôve had the food lock up happen as I was preparing to start launch prep for a nuke. 
---
Hadn‚Äôt considered that. Good point!
---
Damn, really! Sorry man. Add me as a friend on Xbox so you can just follow me into new servers and hopefully get in first lol
---
I notice this on some servers and not others, and it is not common for me at all. Usually it seems to happen on servers with more uptime.
---
Yes I was thinking of party boy, my bad
---
I dunno, pairing it with eliminating slap damage (and eventually eliminating CAMP damage) should move most of the the problem children over there.
---
Has anyone seen the Psychotats recipe anywhere? It's never in the Enclave for me. 
---
I've had all this too with one addition that there'll be a 2nd enemy type that kills the boss enemy. I still get the v regular rewards from the event without killing the boss and possibly getting a legendary item. Prior to the last patch Horde Events were the most reliable except for getting 5 locations to search even though the quest detail says 4 locations.
---
Loading in. Sweet
---
This is the best way imo
---
It's actually been the opposite for me as I've seen more legendaries in general 
---
Cowboy outfit, raider longcoat, that sort of thing.
---
They removed slap damage from Adventure. I'm talking about Survival mode. 
---
Fast travel
---
geez, step back a  moment and dont be a dick yourself, he simply stated that not everyone has the free time to play every single day
---
most normal people have families, jobs, responsibilities
---
Burn it! Burn it! Burn it! Burn it!
---
Yeah I feel I've wasted too much time thinking some kind of rhyme or reason. A pattern of how to get the masks. It's probably just bugged like everything else
---
They weren‚Äôt rebanned due to cheating a second time; they re-‚Äúsuspended‚Äù because of server stability. Many, if not most, should get there accounts back, eventually. 
---
Wow! Actually sounds pretty well thought out with advantages on both sides of the game modes. ‚Åπ/10 I really enjoy the update.
---
I enjoy that you can go back and forth between modes if you want though. I know this decision will split the community but I think for the long run it'll be nice. This way new players can start in adventure and move onto survival if they so choose.
---
Gonna be honest the critics will get so much content outta that by saying Bethesda is lazy and trying to pull a J.K Rowling on us. But still love the idea. of exploring with your friends and seeing a rainbow while fighting a giant hermit crab.
---
I too am interested in this. I don‚Äôt even need 50 in one night but just some fast leveling for an alt. 
---
You are on a roll this week man. I caught two rounds around 5pm yesterday. If you need keycard donations let me know, I have 3-4 I can spare. I'll be online around 515 est.
---
How are there 40 buzzkills around that would upvote such a buzzkill thread? 
---
Oooo. I want pinup outfits. 
---
It‚Äôs been faster for me (Xbox)
---
I took off my power helmet and by head disappeared as well. Was trying to wear a mask.
---
Oooh that seems cool but i will need to get the perk that lets me keep mutations
---
Griefers are going to use the no slap damage system to their advantage in the wost way. Also people are going to complain nonstop about getting ganked by people flipping workshops.
---
Survival mode should also not be a toggle for existing characters and people should have to start over.
---
Sorry im in ps4 thanks
---
It really isn't, it just divides the community.
---
I was excited for the PvP mode until I read the part of putting a bounty on someone's head when they kill you. That's going to lead to some pettiness.  
---
Also is everyone going to be visible on the map still? If that's the case anyone who isn't rocking assassin's sentinel is going to be crouching everywhere.  
---
Great call on reducing CAMP destruction, this actually encourages players to use the vending machines and building in public areas. I've got an expensive CAMP so I am impossible to find and reach.
---
Care to share how C.A.M.P.s will transfer from adventure to survival? Would a player be able to destroy my camp with no restrictions in survival?
---
Well there are very awesome mods for Fallout 4 that will work also for FO76. But because Bethesda are bunch of incompetent monkeys, you will get ban if you use mods :D
---
You're talking about a game whose signature weapon is a nuke shot from a slingshot. 
---
Happened on PS4 a couple nights ago.   Only saw it on one bloated, but was on one of the front apartment steps.
---
I think that's 6 central, I can try to be on but have a meeting at 7 and I'm the head of the organization so I need to be early. 
---
I'd trade for Giant, don't have that one yet. 
---
Also no damage to camps will be a blessing once player vending comes into play 
---
SBQ?
---
No one is visible except people who have bounties or are high up in the leaderboards. 
---
Agreed.
---
Me to be fair. I have Goblin and Owl so far but I‚Äôd really like Witch.
---
Gamer tag is; TheChanelOberln if you‚Äôre around 
---
Ah alrighty
---
Ah yes that's it.  Party Boy/Girl should just be as follows:
---
Rank 1 - Gain 1 Luck from Alcohol
---
Rank 2 - Gain Double the Benefit from Drinking Alcohol
---
Rank 3 - Immune to Addiction and Effects last twice as long.
---
Boom done.
---
I knew something was up. I have a ton of fertilizer now because of this bug. Plus im eating and drinking constantly, much more than I had to before and this is without mutations. I went meat farming the other day, logged off and back on the next morning and all of it was spoiled. This didn't happen before the patch.
---
My [build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3249f8&amp;d=c72a41a00ib4l71lt2pc2as2sb2sd2su1sg2s01so1eg1ic3lu2a72s72a12&amp;w=sw2sp0&amp;n=ww) if anyone wonders how I put shotgun/explosive/tank/chems and QoL perks together!
---
Can u share the method?
---
Some new neon lights for saying things like bar, club, welcome, store etc would be really handy too. 
---
H: real cash to spend on more atoms.
---
W: something cool please.
---
You load into the world quickly, the world loads up around you in very slow motion.  If you're away from your camp, you can't even fast travel to it until it happily loads up on the server.
---
Im from Argentina but i ussually play with players from america, i dont talk cause i dont really like speaking english but i use my phone to write faster, if thats not a problem i will add you right away.
---
What level are you btw?(doesnt really matter but im just curious)
---
my psn: sofiantobias01
---
I didn't 
---
That is the worst part. It means you can hop over to adventure mode and get all those sweet legendaries with zero risk and then hop back over and tear all the people trying to level in survival mode to shreds
---
Oh I see, I usually fill that in with random things because there‚Äôs always something else I need to sell too (carrying around 35 medex is a little excessive)
---
Thank you man! I‚Äôm good for keycards bro but thank you for the offer! Hope you manage to get in today at some point!
---
It doesn't say that it's only melee though, and I'm not 100% sure that your referring to the same thing as I am. I'm talking about the armor effect, I think your talking about the weapon legendary effect.
---
This. Not having it be only new characters is a huge mistake. 
---
Beret is not a rare mask. It is in the secondary rewards pool with all of the Plans and Recipes.
---
Odd, your carry weight should absolutely go up. At 20 percent health I can carry more than I can in power armor with the exception of excavator.
---
So not sure i like the switch whenever you want from adventure to survival. I do like the removal of slap damage. But why not just get rid of PVP completely from adventure mode? IF people want to do pvp they can switch to survival..... I guess i dont see the point of still having pvp capabilities in adventure.
---
I vote a Melee weapon or a lever-action rifle. Melee is nice to clear out trash mobs for very little cost (ammo/repair mats) and a lever action is great for high damage per bullet cost with a decent RoF. 
---
Neat. Thanks.
---
Yeah i just discussed this with a design engineer at my work. He said exactly this as well. 
---
Thats what happens when you move to management. You get dumber everyday! 
---
The problem children will be abusing the new invunerability in adventure mode more than anything else.
---
I love this game, I was excited when it was announced, and didn‚Äôt hate it once I got it. However, the recent server instability is unbearable. I‚Äôm not going to stop playing, but still. 
---
Just turn on pacifist mode. There is no more slap damage
---
The workshop is probably true. But I have no idea how Griefers will use ‚Äúno slap damage‚Äù to their benefit. Except waiting for you to walk past cars
---
Shooting all of the balloons during the parade does make the event less tedious.
---
Seriously.  I get so paranoid whenever I see anyone headed over to my camp.  The other day someone was standing in front of the door doing heart emotes wanting to come in....I freaked out so much I logged off the server.  
---
Based on past experiences I have trust issues.....
---
I've seen Elder since they became available, can confirm. 
---
That still makes PvP encounters a possible loss with the bounty system. Not sure why that's added.
---
20% XP bonus?!?! I don't particularly like PVP but I will be playing on Survival Mode just for that XP bonus!!!
---
They can do the same thing then. At this point too many people have OP weapons that this point is moot imo. If you want to level in survival, sweet! But there's always a bigger fish.
---
You got caps for the event. I just got a mask 
---
There are neon lights! It‚Äôs just too bad there‚Äôs a 50 light max. I had more ideas for my club. :(
---
well, then you miss out on the game, but gain experience in real life. is that so bad? it's just a game... you can't have everything
---
Woah okay, so you insult me and blamed me for the reason why games adopted scummy practices? Anything else? Care to share what practices your speaking of and back it up with facts?
---
I don‚Äôt recall ‚Äúaccepting the game for what it is‚Äù I just suggested an empathetic approach, rather then a hostile one. 
---
I really hope you never personally find out what it‚Äôs like to be treated hatefully; the same way everyone is treating Bethesda right now.
---
All I really understand is, I am not following the flock of sheep, so your targeting me as well with your hate.
---
Honestly man, I got better things to do with my time then argue with someone who‚Äôs being blatantly cruel, calling my logic broken because it‚Äôs different, and telling me I am the reason for poor practices; when in reality All I‚Äôve done is to cut Bethesda some slack and thank them for what they have fixed, but I guess I‚Äôm the bad guy LOL. 
---
Yeah treating the employees like shits going to stop corrupt corporate owners from pinching every penny from people. let‚Äôs waste our time and effort attacking the fathers working to bring home some bacon, rather then thanking them for the hard work.
---
This country is so entitled and ignorant it isn‚Äôt funny.
---
Not really trying to change your mind, but I've found for my playstyle the lever action is best.  The rate of fire and reload is pretty key for me.  Usually 1-2 shot all enemies but the big boys.  
---
I run gun-fu with vats and rank 1 grim reaper's and can wipe out a big ol' group of super mutants before they know what hits them.  
---
Plus 45 ammo is everywhere :)
---
Rare. I did almost 20 runs
---
This looks great!  Im only worried about the wanted bounty system, which looks abusable.  If I can place a bounty on someone through the social side bar, then I can use it to have people marked on the map.  Now I can use that to track anyone I want at any time.
---
The bounty system shouldnt pin point the bounty location, it should show an area instead.  And perhaps have the price high enough so it's expensive to abuse.
---
Yeah thats what I've heard. I just assumed this was the normal. I can admit back when I carried way way to much I would only walk around 900. When I got beliw 20% i could run again but those numbers didnt change.
---
Could it just chanhe on the back end?
---
Good idea, will do!
---
I couldn't find any at night or during the day. Maybe I'm just unlucky?
---
How will you abuse that? What's the worst someone can do to other player if they cant even hurt them?
---
Thanks for the offer but I actually got one in one of my run throughs yesterday. 
---
That would be why they're rare... It's not like they're untradable items... You can always buy in from another player later...
---
Was this on PC? I posted about him a few days ago.
---
There have been no bans for modding. All bans have been from users using tools like cheat engine or exploiting 
---
Ooh, I like the addition of unique weapons as rewards for playing survival! I'm only a level 29 so I don't think I'll bother for some time, but it's a really cool idea that I'm excited for
---
Yeah, I think so. I think CAMPs are treated like players in both modes
---
Wait, isn't Central time 2 hours ahead, not behind Pacific time? That would be 10 your time, the thing is I have a track meet that goes to around 6 my time, which I'm pretty sure is 8 your time, so that is pretty bad timing. What time does your meeting end, otherwise I can probably trade tomorrow at around 3 or 4 my time. What mask of mine did you want? I listed them in the original comment.
---
Yea just try server hopping at night or wait for a heart of the swamp event those also spawn 
---
Yeah I was my bad 
---
And more hairstyles!!!
---
"Rare" in terms of like... 10% chance or so (maybe mostly due to sharing a pool with quite a number of CAMP plans).  Not "Rare" like the current Rare Masks which appear to be 0 in 6600.
---
How will Griefers use the system in adventure mode in the worst ways? If you trip someones workshop when they own it, you'll still become hostile.
---
I noticed this yesterday, my tiny, tiny wooden shack with maybe 7 things in it took a good 2 minutes to load.
---
Where did you learn this 
---
Someone probably got one of the rares masks but thought it was normal and didn't think anything of it and there is 1 person out there with a rare mask. Spooky to think about.
---
Oh, I get you. Yeah, once a week or so, I'll sell off the chems/health/crap weapons &amp; armor and bulk some junk, if needed. 
---
This is a distinct possibility...cuz I seem to get into the server quicker, but then the camp takes longer.
---
But every one gets caps too
---
Is there a prime throwing knife plan? If it exists I think that should add damage lol.
---
I keep getting only stimpacks, ammo, and the occasional scribe uniform.
---
Are you wearing BoS items when turning in the TD?
---
The random number would either be of type float or double (depending on which data type they are using) which has a finite number of values and only one number of that range is the value.  To get the probability it's 1 in (number of possible float values) OR 1 in (number of possible double values).  You can just google the number of possible float values, or google the number of possible double values.  
---
Lol... But not everyone cheated again with there second chance?
---

---
Is it just me or have they removed Radstorms from the game?
---
No they didn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs a quest line to get her outfit.
---
&gt; Considering the mire events has a 0.02% chance to drop event outfits, I am not surprised if this is the case too.
---
Main difference being that those events don't disappear after 7 days (or, 5 more days now).
---
For some odd reason, I kinda like toothy man.
---
(maybe he reminds me of people I know IRL)
---
My fav so far is still the plain Fachnacht Man mask (which I've had for some time).  Works well with the clown outfit.
---
Yep, same Here (on Ps4), every time I server hop, my ribeye steak is gone... :(
---
Was this verified?
---
I haven‚Äôt seen Bethesda comment on this yet. Maybe there‚Äôs a surprise for us on March 26th 
---
Lol, no worries
---
God I love when a PCMR cries about performance and us console folks are just loving life and decent frame rates.
---
It's even better when they blame the game instead of their hardware and its limitations.
---
The perk card set up is pretty nice once you get used to it. Its pretty easy to sacrifice a little damage for the ability to keep the perks you want slotted all the time, and swap in other situationals as needed. If you had to go somewhere to reset them, it would be annoying AF, could you imagine getting 3/4s of the way through clearing someplace, find a lvl 3 locked door and realize you only slotted the first 2 ranks and now cant access said area.
---
90% of my cards never get unslotted, with just a few being slotted in when needed, like lockpick 3, the hacker perks, sunkissed, good doggy, glowsights.
---
And all bullets are not the same, we have multiple different damage styles like ballistic, energy, explosive, radiation, melee. Also larger caliber rifles are able to run larger grain tips, a higher grain tip will do more kinetic damage, and higher caliber bullets generally have larger powder charged, meaning increased range and velocity. A .308 should hit for more damage than a .38 no matter the mods of the .38.
---
I was excited to see the "NEW" legendaries. Then I read them and they are just old legendaries with names. How is that new?
---
Wasn't it a drinking glass?
---
The game was a dirty trick and a money grab, I stopped playing a week after launch due to nothing in the game, here we are a year later and people are still waiting on vaults, nah I‚Äôm ok replaying nier and looking forward to outward when it comes out, Bethesda burned me too hard this time and I won‚Äôt be supporting major publishers until they clean up their act, this is industry wide mind you with a few exceptions, publishers are just riding their success from the 1990-2000 and everyone still thinks there is some good left in them lol it‚Äôs all about the bottom line dollar amount with pubbies, that‚Äôs why you are going to see the real gems start to gain steam in the future years like CD Projekt. It‚Äôs sad because I love fallout but what was this mess lmao.

---
This melee me think of the canteena in star wars. I like it
---
I never seen caps. Of course now I will need to test it. I just assumed no caps or xp since I didn't see it show at the end of the event. 
---
Nothing wrong with a rare drop rate, quit bitching. 
---
Yes it was. Sorry if I missed that post. I sort by new to try to see everything but I must've missed it.
---
The game isn't intended to be a PvsE game, but if you don't want to participate in PvP you don't have to now. I don't typically like to engage, but every once in a while there are situations where I iwll (someone steals one of the cargo crates I've requested for instance or someone tries to takeover a workshop or someone challenges me and for the hell of it I'll engage rarely) but I don't want to be forced into PvP all of the time I'm playing, which is what is happening in the new mode. I think this is a good compromise.
---
I had 3 non glowing ghouls fall through the back steps of one of the apartments. 3. All at once. 
---
There are heavy gun perks hidden in Intelligence, and the damage boost from 200% condition with Weapon Artisan is also wicked important. Base reload speed will kill you so speeding that up is important
---
I get 60 caps each event
---
Players won't appear on the map? Talk about hiding the danger!!
---
I am mostly curious about the weapon balance issues though.
---
The new weapons are interresting. I wanted to make a new character for the PvP only, but I don't want to miss Sole Survivor et Action Hero...
---
&gt;  What's the worst someone can do to other player if they cant even hurt them?
---
Waste a bunch of ammo till the player on the receiving end hops servers and blocks them
---
30fps &gt; your single digit fps's üòÅ
---
I would guess it's there to discourage things being a PVP deathfest, because you might just get a huge bounty. The caps also don't come from you, they come from whoever set the bounty. 
---
I‚Äôm going to play Survival Mode alone for the limited Fast Travel. Walking around to explore feels like a waste when I can just fast travel anywhere. It was a crucial component to immersion in Fallout 4 survival, and I‚Äôm glad 76 is getting closer in that respect.
---
If I read that correctly that means you can switch back and forth from game modes with the same character right?
---
Yeah a Radbow that burns a crater where ever it touches the ground. When you reach the end of the radbow you find a mole man in green defending his gold mine
---
So lucky, I do this every day(sometimes twice)and never anything but stimpacs and worthless ammo, never any BOS love.  Starting to think I‚Äôm just bugged or have the worst luck ever.
---
At the very least, glow sights should still work.
---
What negative? Even if your addicted you can just take a drink to remove the negatives. Addictions also don't cross server hops.
---
Oof, long morning but you're right. 
---
Griefing involves far more creative activities than just pvp or doing damage to other players. With this change it will be possible to deny people the use of their own services in their own camp indefinitely with zero threat of recourse for example.
---
There are soooo many ways this can be abused.
---
Well shit. Thanks for clearing that up
---
And on the subject of the perk cards - No issues here I really like it.  
---
It's the management of those perk cards which is tedious and time consuming hence why suggested a perk load out system.
---
It can only be placed when you are killed by that person
---
Yes, the community is divided. There are those that want to focus on coop adventures and exploring and base building with friends and those that want to engage in a higher PVP content mode. 
---
They are for the most part mutually exclusive player groups.
---
I'm not sure what I'm losing with the pvpers playing in their own sandbox , care to elaborate ? 
---
Don‚Äôt do it that‚Äôs way too much. I sold 250 for 500
---
You that kinda bitch that doesn't put their pennies in the donation container at Wal-Mart aren't you?
---
Fair points all actually, and if people like you were more vocal in threads like these then it might be worth the time and effort. Get a group of 4 to storm a silo, then sit and wait for the parade to pop and send a messenger with ransom like you implied, that's actually a fantastic role play, but no one would bite because they'd be too busy calling the messenger a griefer, asshole, duper, and much worse.
---
Ergo the revenge role play, raiders are vindictive sons of bitches that would hate seeing the responders throw a party and parade when they denied pleasant valley food and medicine. Admittedly pleasant valley was demanding more than their share, but that's what leads to raiders. 
---
Genuinely, i would love for the community to begrudgingly accept their misbehaving miscreants. To be able to ransom helvetia for 500 caps (realistically pennies compared to how many people show up) and run off shouting "tunnel snakes rule" is what sets fallout raiders aside from mad max, or borderlands. 
---
You pay the caps for the bounty when you set it, so for bounties people will actually go after you'll probably have to pay a lot. It also doesn't seem like you can place a bounty unless the person you're placing it on killed you. 
---
Thru hiker
---
It really should not work, they just forgot to add good perks for energy weapons. 
---
Nuking the prime site spawns the scorched beast queen 
---
There is one by the back door of the tattoo shop 
---
Yeah, it is totally nuts to not separate the modes and allow people to jump back and forth
---
Did you miss the part where I said I don't lock my purifiers? 
---
So with the math on this page- it's a one in ten thousand chance to get a really rare mask. 
---
There's not even ten thousand responses to the poll yet....
---
I always do this to newer players. 
---
Yeah, you can go ahead and leave me out of your dumbassary
---
Ah, too late, live and learn
---
... it very clearly says you can only choose to mark someone as Wanted if they kill you. 
---
OMG I added it just to see what it does, such a waste of budget.  I also don‚Äôt need fertilizer just thought it was cool to have Betsy around.
---
You can apparently hurt Wanted players in events (so I hear), although VATS targeting will not work.
---
It can't be his first mmo since it's not an mmo
---
Didn't think anything of it and scrapped it lol
---
Yessir. 
---
Ban all mules
---
Good karma an good vibes!
---
Probably not. But you can tell your high level friends who enjoy pvp. 
---
Why on earth can our characters swap back and forth. That is awful for a mode designed for competition 
---
Honestly, I did miss it.
---
My bad.
---
I would integrate Party Boy into this perk to make it work. Endurance really needs some buffs to make people spend the points.
---
Professional Drinker 
---
* 2* Reduced Chance of getting addicted to Alcohol. Effects of Alcohol are doubled
---
* 3* No chance of getting addicted to Alcohol. Effects of Alcohol are tripled 
---
Then i would make the charisma perk more in the theme of sharing with your teammates. 
---
Party Boy/Girl
---
*  2*  Share effects of alcohol with nearby teammates
---
*  3*  Share positive effects of alcohol with nearby teammates.
---
.... Only if i can find/buy a leprechaun outfit and laugh like the lucky charms guy randomly
---
Seriously?
---
The only time ive had issues was if i had a bounty. When i was New I used to freak out but lately the only annoyance I have now is people leaving my doors open. But I dont have defences and I do not build on whitesprings.
---
And the worse you'll get from me is I'll turn off all your lights before i leave.
---
Touche! On the matter of tech specs - I build my own computers and I have done for years. I'm not shying away from the fact that my computer isn't filled with the latest gen components.  My point being that Fallout 76 is built on an engine for a game that was released 5 years ago when my machine was top spec. 76 Makes no graphical leaps over its predecessor. It's basically a re-skin. Most games I play, including many survival that support more players and maps just as big run 60fps+ The fact that this game looks as dated as it does and you need a tank to run it at average settings suggests the game needs some serious optimisation.  
---
If you think it's just me whinning then take a step outside of this sub-reddit and check out what others are saying because I'm certainly not alone.
---
Use a scope. Best reason to upgrade to a recon short scope. Works great
---
Yes but have in mind you can lose aid items an many caps
---
Literal people. The community itself (which currently is all in the same sandbox) will get divided and it isn't even that big to begin with.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind the lever action rifle! But I hate pvp.
---
I think it depends most on your preferred play style. I've leveled a few sneak-snipers since launch and I always end up going back to the lever action, mostly because it seems like the middle point between rate of fire and damage. Its easy to one or two shot things at range, but it fires and reloads fast enough that you're not SOL if you get cornered.
---
Thats broke people problems  LOL
---
Hold on...assuming OP‚Äôs info is correct, that means there‚Äôs a 1 in ~16 million chance of a rare mask drop? FFS Bethesda.
---
Welcome to MMO rare drops.
---
I have one. It alerts surrounding units but doesnt direct them towards you unless you have crappy sneak
---
Yeah thanks for calling me a bitch ya little twat. Guess I'll be locking them out of spite tonight lol.
---
Yes. I have several minutes pass at times before it registers. 
---
You might actually be surprised to find out that most of the people who participate in PVP are also doing coop everything pve too.
---
Hmm, interesting. And that doesn‚Äôt happen with a non-explosive?
---
I am starting to really like my Gatlin gun as an alternate to a rifle. 
---
I use a .50 machine gun if i'm getting mobbed. 
---
With a massive cap stash at the end.
---
&gt; My Appalachian strip club needs this.
---
The hero we deserve
---
I hope that switching between them will not be as much as an issue as imagine it could be.
---
The 20% exp boost could help keep players around but what else is going to stop players from just playing survival until their supplies run out, and then just resupply in adventure mode.
---
Does that not defeat the purpose of a higher stakes mode if players can just run away back to easy mode once something doesn‚Äôt go their way?
---
Yeah, saw a guy at WS wearing these masks I'd never seen. Posted on this sub with pics even. No one had seen them before and everyone said they were from the dev chest but this guy said it was just a rare drop; that the chances of the masks dropping were so low as to be negligible
---
Fallout 4&gt;Failout 76
---
With a silencer on a regular non explodey rifle they wont react unless they see it
---
Sole survivor rifle?
---
Or even just a picture of the person wearing it at the event site. Otherwise the ‚Äòproof‚Äô is just pictures someone took when they accessed the dev room. 
---
Wish I didn't have class man.. this sounds great.
---
Furthermore, if the drop chances are TOO low, the items are virtually unobtainable.  The event runs for ONE week.  That's 168 hours.  Each run takes about 15-20 minutes (due to the slow walking of the bots) assuming everyone participating is working efficiently.  That's a maximum of 4 times an hour.  So 672 total possible runs if you are hopping servers and finding the event starting or in progress already (won't happen every time, so it averages out.)  That's assuming playing the event and nothing else, no sleep, no breaks, NADA but grinding Fasnacht.
---
And contrary to what the Devs have claimed, you don't always get a mask if all the bots survived.  I've had THREE runs where they all survived, but I received NO MASK.  Still got a plan, but no mask reward (yes, checked inventory, it simply did not award.)
---
Okay. This sounds really fun and well thought out by Bethesda. 
---
How about we make a peace contract to get the 20% XP?
---
I understand that part I'm just not understanding how that affects me or my group , like if we log in and no one is on the server but us I'd be happy . 
---
 theres no content we do that we go "if only we had a few more pvpers " we dont really bother with nuke runs or SBQ  fights . 
---
Thanks for ruining adventure mode care bears. 
---
They should have given you guys a pve mode and left adventure mode as is. 
---
Survival mode looks great tho. Ill be in there for sure.
---
Link to the article instead of posting it word for word. I‚Äôm not reading your post, I‚Äôm gonna read the article
---
I think so too, they should of made it so that character has to stay in that game mode. 
---
you may think he's griefing, but he could be testing. The Devs said in an interview that the masks depend on which robots live and die. And I don't know about you guys but pretty every single event I've done 4-5 robots survive. I've been trying with friends to let all die but 1, but it's hard to make others do the same thing, so maybe he's trying to do something like that
---
Lol yes you can buy them from the SWARMS of people who have the masks... lol. For whatever reason there needs to be more transparency with this 1 week event. If there's a requirement make it so people can figure it out and not just have leprechaun luck. If they were doing it how you said there should be a heads up regardless or even an update. The event is cool enough but for the rare masks it was handled poorly 
---
I‚Äôm also hiring dancers and bartenders. ;)
---
Agreed, if they don't change anything stealthy snipers will be the way to go. I think they've indicated "better rewards" for playing survival so it will interesting to see what they come up with to try and lure people into it 
---
Think about an invincible person following you around for hours slinging insults and doing things like blocking vendor access, training mobs into your camp, etc...
---
I haven't done this quest. Why would someone block the robots?
---
I think I remember seeing in a patch that the game now won‚Äôt spawn your player in until loading is done to prevent players being attacked before they can even move. Maybe it backfired and the game now just spawns you in before it‚Äôs properly loaded things around you.
---
I actually can't believe they ignored the blatant amount of people on here asking for new characters only. 
---
I can‚Äôt even get the biv daily to pop for me. I‚Äôve had to look up online that the daily was even a thing, as I knew I was missing something to get recipes, just couldn‚Äôt work out what!! 
---
Getting really frustrated, chunks of the challenges are all alcohol brewing related, and I struggle to do them. 
---
looks like my stealth/sniper alt will be leveling up a bit faster......and getting shot in the face a lot more....either way, sounds like a good time
---
I love helping out new players. My camps right next to Vault 76 for new players to come and get prepared
---
The first time I played it the decorator wasn‚Äôt there.
---
Seriously. My brother had it as one of Biv's dailies and couldn't find the blooms anywhere so he couldn't finish the quest. I'm not looking forward to getting that one, lol.
---
i'd rather that than being killed every 2 seconds
---
I've cut a very tiny diamond out of the adhesive-part on a sticky note in the past. Easy to remove.
---
And also that even after 2 days of people doing events (not even grinding them like people are with this), we saw posts. Not old wives tales.
---
Too to know, thanks! I guess for maximum stealth you don‚Äôt use the explosive effect 
---
I agree. Just look at [the card itself](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/d/dc/Professional_Drinker_perk.png), the way to alcohol is being stored it makes sense that the weight should be reduced.
---
Where is your camp located? Also how do you get the plans to that sign! (Newer to camp building in 76). Thanks!
---
I'd have to go try them all and compare to see if they progressed to be certain, but the "Discover Locations" challenges are all broken, "Discover Recipes" and "Collect Plants" are both super low even though I've collected most/all of those, and I know for a fact that "Scrap or Craft Clothes" isn't increasing; I suspect several of the other "Scrap of Craft" challenges aren't either, I should have *way* more of those done by this point than it claims. Oh, and "Collect Caps in Regions", I think.
---
Well, I can only give you honest answers to things I know. The guy was never revived on his own. First time I downed him, he nearly bled out before a random person nearby stimmed him. This was AFTER I fired about 2 clips of 2-shot lever action rounds into his head while he was down, with me using a low-health bloodied build, nerd rage, adrenal reaction, 3 sets of rank 3 rifleman cards, a stealth bonus, Tank Killer, Bloody Mess, etc...I'm hitting for an absurd amount of damage repeatedly on a downed opponent's head to absolutely no effect. 
---
The SECOND time I downed him after he got revived by the random bystander, not 30 seconds later, the same thing was happening, accept this time he had nobody near to revive him. I got irritated, pulled out my Dragon, blasted him in the head, and he either bled out, gave up, or the Dragon killed him. I'm not sure which, because it took so long. 
---
Do I think that was an exploit? No, I think it was a bug. Check out my edit to the main post where another user explained to me that sometimes when a server is laggy because of overload or bad connection, you need to switch weapons or melee a downed opponent to finish them before the bleed-out timer. Or, apparently you can use Cannibal to execute them. This is a real problem if you don't know it, especially if your opponent has teammates who can just keep reviving them so you can never actually get a kill. 
---
I didn't see Serendipity proc, nor mysterious savior, or Life Saving, or any of the other ways I know you can survive being shot when down or get out of a downed state.
---
Finally, I never reported him. I came here first to see if I was mistaken about anything. Seems that a wanted player CAN get in an event with you and be un-targetable with VATS and invulnerable to other players for the duration of the event, which he knew and was doing on purpose. That fact is probably something the devs will have to patch.
---
And finally, I can get on top of Seneca Rocks too, but you are extremely vulnerable while scaling them, and your opponent has an extreme advantage. Especially against people without a jetpack or Marsupial. And I don't know how long you have been playing but a while back people were setting their CAMP to clip under the terrain at the top of Seneca Rocks so noone could get to them and using it to rack up HUGE bounties, then having a team-mate kill them to "rinse" the bounty status and splitting all the caps they farmed off people. It was extremely common until the devs fixed it. Even without the terrain CAMP exploit, you can still do a lot of damage bounty-baiting from up there, and I watched him doing it and was about ready to go hunt him down when he ran to Helvetia to mess with people there.
---
Same here, I‚Äôve been disconnected a few times only to find my iguana soup, glowing meat steaks and cranberry relish effects have not carried over when I re-log, maybe they did that to penalise server hopping? Very frustrating when it‚Äôs because you were kicked though :(
---
Or if they are only available if the area is nuked beforehand.
---
The old man winter mask has already been confirmed to be a drop
---
Well are you that bitch that doesn't leave their pennies?
---
Because if you're not, then I didn't call you a bitch.
---
Go look at Jugs videos on YouTube. There are some things you can do that will make it hurt less. Like putting things in walls and every the floating issue. It doesnt fix everything and yeah their is a curve but if you need more budget reduce lighting and no guns.
---
I pretty sure Bethesda confirmed that it was in the game. But said it was "rare" rare my ass no one has got it yet. its just legendary now because it doesn't feel like it exists.
---
(I think thats how it works lmao.)
---
Thank you! This is going to help a lot.
---
It‚Äôs so bad, I hate it.
---
Some people are just raging dickholes 
---
True...but now the two worlds can be exclusive to one another so those who want PVE only dont fall into the seedy PVP world ;)
---
Makes no sense to me.
---
Nice work.
---
Im at about 15 runs now. I have all the common stuff except sausage recipe.
---
FWIW: Just did a run w/5 noobs. Noone was watching for the wolves. We lost 4 robots before i could kill them all. NO DIF IN RESULTS i got a dupe mask and plan.
---
I've never seen a legendary BoS rifle. 
---
That was the first thing I did XD didn‚Äôt work.  I only got out of it from using a stealth boy. I thought possibly the animation could kick me out. 
---
I read that too fast and thought you said ‚ÄúOooo I want Pimp outfits‚Äù lol üòÇ 
---
2 shot isnt strong at all anymore, it got nerfed by like 80%
---
Stop right there, criminal scum!
---
It would be a dick move to say ‚Äúall of the masks are currently available‚Äù when all of the masks aren‚Äôt currently available. How is that so hard to understand?
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/QtVQlF3lmGXkLAZ8GV4VJ/inside-the-vault-survival-mode-beta-overview
---
Yet another stupid decision. What‚Äôs the point in having survival mode then other than to transfer your character to troll or fight then back to adventure mode to replenish? Not only that but all the duping horders are just going to flood the broken economy of Care bear mode into survival. 
---
They might as well have just made a death match mode. Because of this, there‚Äôs going to be nothing survival about it
---
The 2 shot shotgun just adds 1 more pellet to the cartridge, so instead of 7 pellets, you now shoot 8.
---
The giant mask, streamer plans, and caps for the one time I ran it
---
More than that, if they are using a standard Random() RNG implementation, it will be zero, since the range THOSE use is exclusive of 1.0 in the range.  (Most random number generation routines produce a pseudo-random number in the range of \[0.0 - 0.99999999999\] but will never return 1.0.)
---
So to produce a "1 in 6" chance, you do:
---
result = Integer(Random() \* 6.0)
---
which gives you an integer value from 0 to 5.  Then you simply check it against a particular value.  So for a "1 in 100" chance, it would produce a value from 0 to 99.  If you are looking for 100, it simply will NEVER be there.
---
It should be a big death fest damnit. Especially if you roll with no junk and aid items are easy as shit to find, death is meaningless if you don't mind losing caps (also easy as shit to find)
---
IIRC, at least in Fallout 4, damage and exp earned did go to decimals and wasn't rounded, even if you might see "5 exp", you might actually be getting 5.34 or something. That could have changed though. It's also possible that it was so low that he was doing .01 damage per shot or something that would literally take like 100 shots to finish him off. 
---
I agree though, the design of pvp right now is extremely poor, and I really can't see a reason to participate. You either get one shot because you're moving with assn/sent gear on, or you effectively have god mode. And I'm sorry, but most of the people I've talked to who have full pvp sets are buying them on ebay. Kinda kills the game IMO.
---
You can also just go to the fraternity house and it starts the quest there
---
They can absolutely still hurt you using indirect methods. But now you can't hit them back directly to stop them from doing things repeatedly. 
---
Mob training into camps for days.
---
New unique lever action reward for the upcoming survival mode.
---
That‚Äôs a disappointment
---
"swap characters back and forth"
---
Fat nerds with 200+ levels of game time and resources just mindlessly swapping back and forth one shotting everything with TSE or whatever meme weapons and every mutation/maxed out flavor of armor/power armor
---
Aaaaand dropped.
---
My guess is they are fiddling with load order to stop some of the bugs.
---
You don't have to be an asshole 
---
Ok cool, yeah I'm moving over to a different spot now.  Thanks!
---
Very nice changes, that's a solid looking build! Only other advice I could give you, is maybe shave down a few of the points you invested into the 3 point cards, put that into endurance and take a few ranks of ironclad. The extra damage resistance IMO is extremely helpful if you're like me and hate using power armor. Just adds a little extra survivability, but may not be necessary. Other than that, looks real good.
---
And unfortunately, there is no perk card to reduce rifle weights. They get real heavy too! Fully modded hunting rifles and handmade rifles get up to 20 lbs each which blows. The only work around for that is hunting down legendary weapons that have the weightless effect (weighs 90% less), and/or legendary armor that has the effect of reducing weapon weights by 20%
---
Well, personally I've never seen a three star piece of gear drop from a one star enemy.  I have seen three star enemies, however, drop gear ranging from one to three stars.
---
I heard the Gatling was the best 'general purpose' heavy weapon. Also heard the LMG was too, though that sounds about right.
---
Oooh, me want, is there any info on what I does?
---
Yay! Who else is excited to be completely decimated by that guy with a duped two shot explosive automatic weapon?
---
Because the alternative is that people with possibility of playing 10+ hours a day will be griefing the shit out of every less dedicated player.
---
I have this all planned out for myself. If they would separate the characters and forces us to start fresh, I should be ready to farm people in full assasin sentinel sets within I think three days, but there'd be no such geared people. I literally spent hundreds of hours just testing various builds to ensure I can dominate even with crafted gear lol.
---
Such design decision will benefit the majority and will make lifestyle of people such as me less advantageous when it comes to PvP.
---
Yup! I checked with our team and those masks have indeed been dropping. You have to keep in mind not every Fallout player follows this sub, so there will be things that happen in game that don't get shown online if they're not posting about it. 
---
Rip fo76
---
Gotcha, thanks for the tips!
---
Get rid of the pvp scum.
---
I would love this because that is all I do know is drink a lot of beverages and little water. 
---
Its the week 3 reward at least.  Get grinding ;)
---
I have seen the summer mask from the atom shop. Thats it aside from the 5 commons. Havent seen the moon mask yet, though it is available for atoms.
---
YESSSSS!!! FREEDOM FROM PVP FOREVER!!!!
---
There has been a picture of someone with old man winter at the event site but it's taken by someone else. If that's real and the drop rate is just really low, how we haven't seen someone gloating about having it or showing it in an inventory is beyond me. Personally I think these two or three pictures that are floating around are bunk. Clip it or zip it!
---
I'd much prefer Professional Drinker to increase your drunk duration, honestly. Thru-hiker will already reduce the weight by 90%.
---
Have you tried switching out the chameleon piece to see if the weight changes? Maybe just de-equiping might be enough to see if that piece is causing issues with unyielding.
---
I believe they said all the mask can be gotten during the whole festival. 
---
People are just to conspiracy theory about it. They are meant to be rare. Yes, the chances are probably low. Very low. 
---
People just think they are entitled to have everything they want. 
---
Do you ever participate in trading? Less trade partners or customers.
---
Also sounds like offlone coop-op os more your gig. This game is totally not meant to be that. 
---
Dupers have been for the most part have been taken care of.   I personally don't have time to level multiple characters for new modes so this makes me happy
---
Stopped after I removed the two UI mods I was using.
---
&gt; This is UNACCEPTABLE if this is expected to be obtained by the average player
---
Ummmm....if the average player can easily get the mask then it wouldn't exactly be rare
---
Same they shouldn't lock these weapons to pve or should give pvp missions that give legendary weapons that are dedicated and not just hope that the rng gods are in your favor 
---
Then why not just add a new Overseer's questline and let the old one close out so we can get those 18 holotapes out our inventory! My holotapes tab is horribly cluttered. I know they are zero weight, but the insert a holotape popup menu is terrible with so many holotapes.
---
I've only done it 3-4 times. I've only gotten the owl mask every time
---
To the LVL 385 that this morning shot the big animal in two shots: you're an a5shole.
---
There are plenty of low level that would like (after 20 minutes event) to target the best and collect their first legendary price (probably a rolling pin).
---
Spoken like a griefer.
---
Current is a relative term. Currently this week. Currently this second. Currently this patch. Currently this day...  I would understand currently as the duration of the event.
---
Yes. I thought it was just my slow internet.
---
Had they made it to where you have to create a new character, any late comers would be screwed. Would you really want to come in a month or 2 later and everyone else is lvl 50+ except you? 
---
We had a little downtime waiting for a lost bot to join the staging area, I got to make a whole little narrative during it. First throwing up question marks as to what's going on, running down the street to fetch him, using the come with me emote to coax him along and then waiting angrily as he was holding everybody up. Lol
---
I'm not sure what we're "fixing" or what everyone is on about. Some of the masks are rare, that means that they are very difficult to obtain... meaning... not everyone can have one. I don't see the problem. 
---
Alright so my issue seems to be fixed, after sending the ticket to Bethesda eventually my quest restarted from the beginning.
---
My friends pink texture issue according to Bethesda is because he has a GTX 1050ti which apparently falls below their minimum spec of a GTX 780. Game works fine on medium/high graphics other than the DLC being pink textures but I just think Bethesda got lazy with optimising the game on other graphics cards because he can play any other game just fine.
---
Do you not recall the Great Pipboy freeze of Jan 2019??
---
This mode is gonna be a mess.
---
So much entitlement. 
---
Running around like a crack addict with dirty ass underwear isn‚Äôt exactly as sexy as I‚Äôd like my character to be 
---
Will the difficulty level of standard enemies change in survival? Or is that more of a ‚ÄúNuclear Winter‚Äù type of mode change?
---
Hey there can you create a ticket for this and send me the ticket number?
---
As some have pointed out, resetting should resolve the mask not showing up on the Shop. If you haven't already, can you try restarting and let me know if that doesn't resolve the issue?
---
Finally at level 150 took that perk card just so I could do this :D

---
I dunno, this seems more like gamer entitlement to me. 
---
YES!!!! YES!!!!! YEEEEEEEEES!!!!!!!!!!
---
And are many people who play 10+ hours a day not already griefing, were duping or any other form of unwanted behaviour? 
---
That‚Äôs the whole point of survival. It‚Äôs not supposed to be easy. It‚Äôs supposed to be competitive. If you spend ten hours a day playing fallout 76 and use your time effectively then you deserve to dominate in survival.
---
If you want to play casually then play adventure mode 
---
Except they are not exclusive. You can toggle between them freely. Also adventure mode is still not PVE. Workshops and a ton of other ways still exist to bait people into pvp unwittingly even in adventure mode.
---
The butcher is the only one that i have seen every time. All the rest have been absent at least once.
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs changed in this update. Perhaps ‚ÄúNuclear Winter‚Äù
---
I have its sometimes the session or the game itself. I sometimes have to restart my whole system to get true numbers but still i never touch 300. I have issues like this all the time like getting thirsty and hungry in a matter of minutes. Ive accepted this. It could be because all my armor has weight reducing stuff it is causing conflict. But im not here to bitch just wanted input on other types and mixing them up
---
nope , barely trade . I generally play with what I find and pass on stuff between my circle of friends . 
---
the game is quite fun but not particularly hard , i havent really found a need to have to be outfitted with the best gear . 
---
Duping methods have been significantly nerfed for sure but by the time it was fixed the economy was already shattered.   
---
I don't know what it is with people when they start posting on this sub-reddit their IQs drop to 2 and they can't see past their own personal little excitements.
---
They could have approached this in so many ways, maybe you bring across your level 100 but they carry no weapons or gear or just a single gear set and cannot go back? Even that would have been better.  
---
Having another game mode that is supposed to be difficulty but basically allowing them to go back to easy mode at free will completely defeats the point.
---
1. What platform are you playing on?

4) Description of the issue (what happened, where did it occur, what did it affect, quest name etc.)
---
After the recent big brewing patch, I no longer get the popup for the Camden Park daily when i go near it. 
---
5) Bethesda Customer Support Ticket Number (if applicable)
---
Since the update I make whiskey in batches of 55. I stopped running with professional drinker on because I never run out. I can go for 3-5 minutes with -1 Agility and Charisma between combat. I've gone for more than an hour at a time without the debuff because I was using Whiskey out of combat for carry weight. 3 special points to avoid a 2 special point debuff never made sense in retrospect. I just didn't realize it because I had professional drinker on the whole time I was playing on my melee character.
---
As a support build the two perk cards that I use the most is Thru Hiker (200+ canned dog food 30+ of each Nuka soda type 30+ lemonade 200+ purified water ) and Traveling Pharmacy (250+ stim packs, 100+ super stims).
---
I've been accumulating alcohol since the new update and even with thru hiker up I see the issue. Maybe provide an additive bonus with professional drinker + thru hiker combination dropping alcohol weight even further?
---
Maybe they are just trolling you hard
---
There are still ways to make that happen as well.
---
I hope those high level PVE vault raid to be really hard to cause Bethesda to give us guaranteed legs each week. 
---
That argument is irrelevant.  Now all new comers are at risk of getting rekt.  
---
If everybody starts on a level playing field on a difficult setting then there are going to be a lot less folks rolling with unlimited ammo / meds they duped and duped legendary TSE guns.
---
Don't know why you got downvoted for this - I totally agree with you.
---
Seriously if you still get wrecked by TSE builds, you‚Äôre doing something wrong...

Yesterday I was playing and people were near me talking but when I logged back in today it still showed them talking in area. Shows (89 jokerdog115 (AREA)üîä)I logged out then back in again and still there. Why wont it go away?
---
I love the removal of slap damage/camp damage from players you're not hostile to in Adventure.  I think these changes will help enhance the playing experiences of both people trying just to play PvE and those wanting a higher level of PvP.
---
I have scrapped a few hoping for a mod but same results you got
---
I don't know what it is with people when they start commenting on this sub-reddit their IQs drop to 2 and they can't be happy that other people are happy about a small design choice and they end up figuring that everyone is black and white in what they like about this game.  Just super odd, I have no idea, big weird.
---
I don't know, I kinda prefer my 6 strength Whiskeys to 4 strength lasting twice as long. I could just drink twice as much!
---
Really? I don't see it yet, is it coming later? I have seen another player  wearing it in game but only one that I noticed. 
---
Block, server hop. Nuff said. 
---
I leave stuff in the corpses outside v76, overseers camp and the surrounding train stations.
---
Someone was kind enough to do this for me.
---
I'll admit I have been!  I would like to know a good way to get around that!  Any advice?
---
It‚Äôs real finicky. I‚Äôve tried to get the word out about this glitch for months but none of the community managers seem to see my posts/comments. You know what triggers it? The escape artist perk and chameleon combination. There are multiple ways to trigger it and multiple ways to undo it. 
---
Thank you for posting results now I don't have to waste time doing more events. 
---
Pretty sure Goblin is kinda rare
---
It is not broken.
---
1st you can see a players feet kicking up dust and they will show up in the Hud display when the reticle is pointed in their direction.
---
2nd some aids like berry mentats allow stealth players to be seen. You can farm dozens of me tats at The WhiteSprings
---
Good. 
---
Great news but where did you get it from? Cant find anything.
---
One point each in Sun Kissed and Ghoulish. I only take radaway in a nuke zone. I'm swimming in radaway but I'd prefer not to use it as my character is already thirsty enough.
---
This is how there able to pay 100 caps for your junk. Sell you a serum for 800 caps, buy your junk for a few 100 caps, and still net more profit than others.
---
This post read like a used car sale ad because it is.
---
How do you not?
---
Do you want to sell it?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3rxsl/inside_the_vault_survival_mode_beta_overview/
---
Right on.
---
I'm currently running a mix of bos combat unyielding, with varying reduced ammo weapons and fdc minors. I'd like to slowly upgrade to unyileding sentinel with weight reduction but it's hard to find people willing to sell those for caps.
---
That's an awesome idea! 
---
Devs create a new game mode that's supposed to be difficult and for those who want a challenge. Devs then decide that they are basically going to merge easy mode and hard mode together defeating the purpose of hard mode.
---
Why is it so difficult to see the problem here?  
---
The reason they created the mode in the first place is to step up the challenge because there has been a call out for it. Now it doesn't mean anything. It's basically deathmatch mode, not survival as nobody is going to play on survival other than to hunt other players.
---
That's how it's worked in Fallout 4 too though - unique items with the same or very similar effects to normal legendaries.
---
I think moving it to charisma doesn't make much sense as it currently stands but another separate charisma perk like "life of the party" or "booze fairy" or something like that would be funny and functional, grants positive alcohol effects to teammates or doubles positive if they are also drinking. 
---
Lol yeah, just tweak my perk setup so it matches what we have currently when maxed and maybe break it out so luck/extra bonus/immunity is a 3* card in endurance and party boy/girl is a double duration 1*
---
IF you have locksmith perks equipped when you get to Helvetia for the event go to the honey haus and unlock the side door inside. That lets people gather more beeswax
---
Yes, always wait until a legendary item spawns on it
---
"Ultrazit?" Well, I'm never looking at that stuff the same way again. The color does fit, though, and it does appear in those carbuncles... 
---
Well, we have zero proof of anyone legitimately getting one from the event.  If they are so rare that nobody gets any of them during the one week event that seems pointless.
---
Three factors to this:
---
Because PvE people think its them that know it best on how should PvP be like, hence they mostly support the ideas that put them in a disadvantage. TSE nerf is a perfect example - it made me significantly stronger.
---
Because PvP people know they would be at advantage if the survival servers would be separated from adventure, and unlike me they want this advantage.
---
Because separate characters means separate market means new possibilities of selling items for real cash. Unfortunately, that would be a side effect of separating the servers.
---
We dont expect everyone to have one. Or even close. For someone who only runs it a few times, they will likely never see 1.
---
But for those of us who are running it alot; we expect to see 1 or 2 guys here and there who have recieved 1. Maybe even 1 sleepless guy who has 2.
---
There is a dif between lottery "rare" and unicorn "rare". I will never win the lottery, but i know a guy who did. I have never even heard of a guy who has a unicorn.
---
Can we server hop to loot the same in-world loose junk? I thought that was built into the game, if we grab loose junk it disappears for us when loading in. Like when you come across a plan (such as the display cases in Harper's ferry) not looting known ones so that server hopping will net different ones until pick up. 
---
That's why I only hit up an area once per 24 hour period assuming of course it's not already empty.
---
Come one come all, get your get going gear! 
---
How is that any different than right now? You can easily out-heal any slap damage.
---
And you solve that issue by just blocking the person and changing servers. This literally doesn't change anything about adventure mode.
---
People are starting to think it was left over from dev room days
---
Yeah, a good melee weapon is essential, and I think I'm good with my antiarmor + 50% limb damage machete. It dropped yesterday, 10 minutes after my first TSE, it was a good night!  
---
But I never tried any lever action rifle, so thanks for your suggestion, I'm gonna at least shoot a few bullets the next time I loot one.
---
But the thing is, those events and drops will be on the game forever. 
---
This event only lasts a few more days.
---
I'm actually not in favor of this. I thought it would be nice if we all had a fresh start in this new game mode where the effects of the duping epidemic have not been felt yet. That would give us a level playing field at the beginning. I get a feeling that it's going to be hard for people making a new character to compete with those who transfer over their adventure characters which is unfortunate. 
---
Sentinel assassin armor, fireproof perk, dense chest, chems, nuka quantum, build with dodgy, barbarian, serendipity, agility maxed, etc. 
---
Okay.... The griefers are not going to all jump ship over to survival mode.
---
There will actually be far less griefing because of the pvp changes over there. 
---
I don't grief people. Griefers (not pvp players) find ways to abuse the rules of a game world to inflict grief on their targets through all kinds of creative methods, granting invunerability isn't going to  make them stop.
---
They exist and are active, just random and rare, every 1-2 days you'll see one
---
The best statistic on here is that you had a poll and only got 5 trolls, out of 527 responses. Nice job Fallout 76 community!
---
That's how it seems lol
---
You must edit, the robot would need to operate at peak efficiency AND the servers have to stay online.
---
Assuming it's a godmode assn/sent char... couldn't they already do that?
---
Always check those as a lowbie. There‚Äôs a lot of us doing this. 
---
My main is 78 my alt is 58, and I‚Äôm amazed of what folks will pitch. üëç
---
People don't care enough to grief that hard when a simple server hop solves literally all those issues. Also, mob training doesn't really work since ones you go a certain distance away from the enemy spawn location they'll simply turn around and leave you alone.
---
I‚Äôm a bard. I think what you‚Äôre saying is that PvP turned into a rap battles
---
He's not wrong though. Bethesda have gone so badly down hill that I'm expecting TES6 to be a catastrophic failure, re-skinned Skyrim, full of bugs and an absolute waste of money.
---
Username checks out.
---
It is I‚Äôm currently rocking it. I think people spent their atoms fast on old man summer and didn‚Äôt wait it out XD. 
---
I can move just fine,  until my AP runs out üòõ
---
It assumes they aren't lying, it is also only a fraction of actual players as the Reddit forum is hardly the sum of all experiences in F76.  
---
Block and server hop.  That's what its there for.
---
Dense chest for marine armor is definitely an issue for me, I do not have it unlocked :/
---
You can work on a workshop together on a team. I joined with a low level and pimped his workshop out with better stuff. Was fun. He had not seen artillery yet. 
---
* Report player
---
* Block player
---
* Hop servers
---
* Enjoy
---
Get rid of the pvp scum .  They are cowards and without honor.
---
And what about pve improvements? This is all pvp.
---
I would argue most people do not have time to make new characters
---
How naive some people are. The truth is they were just a moron trying to ruin the event for everyone else. 
---
1.  Thank you for putting the full text here, for those of us behind a firewall.
---
2. This actually seems like a well put together game mode.  But the one thing I would change is removing all non-wanted players from the map, with the exception of people at train stations.  If PVP is the end goal there needs to be some fog of war equivalent other than forcing people to stay crouched.  There should always be that paranoia that there's someone nearby with your head in their sights, crouched or otherwise.
---
3. The call of unique legendaries definitely has my interest piqued, and I'm not a hardcore PVP type of guy.  I'm definitely willing to give it a shot for those if anything.
---
4. Respawns/Fast Travel being limited to your camp and train stations reminds me of that suggestion that fast travel be free to and from train stations.  Just throwing that out there.  
---
I may have to go back and see if I can find anything to help me in the meantime üòÅ
---
Yeah. There's usually alot of mid to high level players farming the event, so when it comes to enemies you'll have tons of help. 
---
Plus much of the event is non combat related so you should be fine.
---
You get a Thumbs up from me.  Yes exactly, hold the silo demand payment/tribute or just any form of RP communication before pressing the button.
---
Im 34 and this thread is making me feel young!
---
Although, i did have to quickly think of my age then!
---
I play fo4 on a 960m w/o issues or mods, so I know the engine is okay on your rig.
---
Its tough to say fo76 is the exact same engine as fo4 and previous though, the most glaring difference being 76 is multiplayer, so instead of just you in a world and the whole world revolving only around you and having to only generate and track mobs in your general vicinity, the full 76 map is active and 1 - 24 areas are loaded. You also have other player characters interacting with mobs, objects, and items in your world, which has to be translated to the server and back to you. Your actions must also be passed to the server and displayed for other characters, which was never an issue in fo4 and previous titles.
---
Lighting has been improved on aswell, and there are more environmental effects too, than I noticed playing fo4. Ill agree that graphics havent improved much from fo4, but there is a wack more stuff going on in the background as compared to f04.
---
One thing I always revert to in my mind, is that gif from Horizon Zero Dawn that shows the small sliver of the world that the player actually see's and is loaded, as compared to how much of the world isnt loaded. In 76 that small sliver becomes huge if you have multiple players in a close area. Which is probably taxing local machines and servers.
---
That said, I get pretty nice and smooth framerates all the time, with a small drop in nuke zones when im in the radiation bubble, but never into single digit territory. I dont talk about 76 outside of this sub and filthycasuals, too much hate and downvotes lol, though it doesnt seem r/gaming hates 76 as much as it used too.
---
&gt;Limited fast traveling  
---
&gt;No slap damage  
---
&gt;No stimpack spamming  
---
&gt;More harsh death penalties  
---
&gt;Everyone hidden on map  
---
&gt;Rewarding for being better at the game
---
This looks more and more how Fallout 76 should have been released, in concept wise. 
---
BETHESDA IS LITERALLY GOING TO DIE
---
Yes!!!
---
Just dump them, the only one you need to keep is the silo state one, and that jusr because it costs a ton to replace.
---
well la-dee-da
---
I‚Äôll always put the full text. I remember the people at work. I used to work 6 days a week
---
Embrace the change! The Chernobyl meltdown was in 1986 and that area, while still radioactive, is green and thriving now. Appalachia being beautiful is completely realistic and well done on Bethesda's part.
---
That's a great way to alleviate end game boredom. Tired of doing quests? Try doing it now against people who want to kill you now for a hefty reward.
---
The drop rate decreases heavily after the first few completions.
---
True. It's actually kind of funny that the current defense meta has people investing 50k+ caps in armor setups and yet those armor setups don't help you survive the current offense meta. Just go play rocket tag naked.
---
Such a huge shame you are letting people transfer their characters between modes because this sounds awesome.
---
The problem is that it is now pointless. What's the point in having survival mode if you can just transfer back to adventure mode? It's basically deathmatch mode because nobody with half a brain will quest in this mode. It will be used purely for trolling and fighting. 
---
You could have given players the option to permanently transfer a character from adventure mode with either no gear or just the weapons and armour they have equipped. Even that would have been 10x better.
---
oooh BGS... You were really close here to having something cool! I thought we were going to get a genuine survival mode with difficulty ramped up and full PVP. I was so looking forward to starting fresh and getting stuck in.
---
They definitely drop, seen a few people get the,  goblin and a few people also get the skull mask at the end. Also I've seen one person wearing Winter mask but didn't see him get it at the end, he already had it.
---
That seems very counterintuitive. Why would almost failing the event give better rewards? The guy that datamined the event indicated that the bot survival effects whether or not you get a mask or not and has no bearing on what type of mask you get. That part is random.
---
And if you are really testing it, then you should let others know. There was no indication of his plans until the bots got to the bridge and he set up a blockade. He was deliberately trying to make us fail the event.
---
The fact I won't ever have to worry about some jackass like Tacocatracecar walking up to my CAMP and start destroying it means that the world is a better place.  
---
How does this ruin adventure mode? You can still PvP with people who want to, you just can't slap damage someone to death. 
---
Can't dump quest items. They all continue to be marked as quest items and cannot be dropped or transferred.
---
Look for that Outcast Red myself!
---
Im sure they're holding back for the second half of the event. I wouldn't worry about it. I got my first 5, now i gotta wait for the next 5. I wouldn't want people to burn out the event in matter of 2 days and this post is proof of said gameplay styles.
---
Is it messed up that they don't let us know about this, yes it is, but after info like this pops up, you gotta be smart enough to put the pieces together. 
---
I'm confused. Weapons will be "more deadly", but you're "less likely to be one shot". Also... has anything been done about godmode assn/sent or assn/cav stacking players? As of now it feels like the ONLY viable build is a full assn/sent bloodied sniper.
---
They will dominate nevertheless. The difference is between the extend to which they will do, and the fun factor of the people who are not this minority. This fun factor will be greater if you let the majority keep their guns.
---
How does this kill fo76 at all?
---
That is my point, it changes nothing. Griefing will still exist, in all of the forms we have seen previously and now more. The real solution remains the exact same (block and move servers)
---
Slap damage was easy to heal through but it at least cost them something finite. Now they can just block a vendor or workbench indefinitely with zero material loss.
---
Survival mode is pointless because of this. Everyone should have had to start fresh or had to have made the decision to permanently transfer one character from adventure with only their equipped gear.
---
Because you can swap back and forth, nobody is going to quest or level in this mode. People will only join it to troll and PVP.
---
Anything you'd gain from that will be set back by the fact that you won't be able to farm exp in normal spots due to being ganked constantly, plus you'll have a long run back if you die.
---
Unreleased drop rates. No in-game way of tracking. Limited time repeatable event that we‚Äôve been encouraged to grind out over this week. 
---
People are gonna wanna know the size of the target they‚Äôre shooting at. 
---
I don‚Äôt play actively for anything less than 1% drop rate, for example. I don‚Äôt see the joy. I‚Äôll do the event when I see it, and if I got a rare mask through sheer luck, fantastic. 
---
If they had a drop rate of 1-5% I‚Äôd be playing all week to get them before they‚Äôre gone. 
---
Nothing really to do with entitlement. Some people just wanna know how many times they‚Äôre likely to have to smash their head into the wall before it breaks. 
---
Because they don‚Äôt...
---
Rare and not even spawn are two different things, by now we would have had a bragger asking for full sets of legendary items and rare resources but instead we have complete radio silence. 
---
The first run I did of it I was finding the bots then realized each one would have a different task. I started thinking "man there ain't no way we are all gonna work together to get this done people are gonna fuck around" but sure enough everyone proved me wrong! One guy even moved his camp and cooked us some food he had as part of the celebration. I've decided to pay it forward. I'm stocking up on supplies to give people free food and ammo when I play today.
---
Side note: it's gonna be crazy to go from this wonderful co-operation gameplay to in a week survival mode comes out...we will all be at each other's throats demanding ammo and food with the ultimate consequence being a grognak axe to the head.
---
No shit. The silo and overseers are all I have on me. Didn't think I had to state the obvious about quest tapes.
---
Yeah, happening with the parade masks a lot.  I found that if I step out of my armor, put on my Silver Shroud Fedora and Coat, sunglasses and Veil, that I look like I'm cosplaying as the Invisible Man.  I'm good with this.
---
Why? Leveling is fst enough...
---
I get the feeling you enjoy the current pvp system, which is totally understandable. I also understand it isn't entirely PVE, but at the same time if players enable Pacifist it mostly will be. Obvious exceptions are workshops, but that has always been open for PVP regardless. 
---
I would have definitely preferred 2 separate worlds for pvp and pve, but if they had done that I assume all the people with their bloodied/sentinel gear and builds would have thrown a fit as it would have been wasted. This mode sounds like it will at least give the opportunity for people to dabble in the pvp world to get a taste of whether they like it or not...similiar to how an arena would be. Grab your gear from PVE, then go test it out in PVP, etc.
---
If somebody can be baited into PVP on the PVE (just calling it this for sake that it's shorter than Adventure Mode), it'll happen once or twice before they learn. If they don't, it sort of becomes their problem at that point sadly.  I've played since beta and haven't encountered more than a handful of PVP situations I didn't willingly participate in... 
---
Looks cool, thanks :)
---
Doesn't Luck have to do with CND levels?
---
I just hope they fix it in adventure mode if you take a workshop, and enter into pvp, you can ONLY pvp in the workshop, so that people cant just find you in the world randomly outside of the workshop and kill you, or travel to your house and destroy it just because you have a workshop on the other side of the world
---
20% is worth the risk for me.
---
That was the proper solution with slap damage enabled as well.
---
2SEs are old pvp news. They only do an extra 20% damage. The fireproof perk alone can counter a TSE build

Swing as your mount was attainable, we are talking two completely different rarities.
---
The quest is not necessarily over, even if you find all the tapes. There may be more in the future possibly to find out their ultimate fate
---
Yeah thats a good sidestep on beths part. I am a rebanned player but have another acct. tried playing a couple hrs yesterday and the servers were crap. Super glitchy couple dashboards. I first thought the servers were overloaded with the unbanned players and/or possible excess inventory... however since rebann nothing has gotten better.
---
No way yet.  Pretty sure they'll be expanded upon in the future content.
---
Question. When they say Daily quest...i finished one around 10-11 last night.
---
can i do one right now or do i have to wait 20-24 hours like i do with the vendors?
---
I noticed they changed the loading mechanics so it doesnt require the cell to be loaded before releasing controls to the player. now they have stuff load in
---
Also, if you've claimed a workshop you are automatically flagged for PvP. Workshops were designed to be contested by other players that way.
---
I scrapped the gilded minigun I had found on a random scorched, hoping to learn the paint plan. Much regret.
---
I've noticed my camp takes a lot longer to load
---
It's a tough call. If they made everyone create a new character, that would mean any person that starts survival mode a month or so down the road would be slaughtered upon entering the mode by the people that have been playing since. On the other hand, allowing players to jump back and forth between modes creates some wacky balancing issues and such. 
---
They may need to have some sort of penalty for switching between modes, but they did say it was a "beta" for survival mode so who knows what they will eventually stick with at this point. 
---
As stated earlier, they could have approached it by letting you permenently transfer a character with it's progress and equipped gear. Even that would have been 10x better.
---
Just relog... 
---
That bit now with added no damage to your armor/ stimpack wastage
---
Three runs there were four robots left and one run there were two of us left All the Rest full robots
---
I stood there for exactly one and a half minutes waiting for my camp to load in yesterday. 
---
Do we keep progress in our survival mode characters during beta?
---
I haven't run into any performance issues that seemed hardware related. I expect the GTX970 should be fine. I'm running a 1070 and there isn't that much difference between the two. I'm less sure about the processor.  Most of the technical glitches seem to be game-stability or server-related. 
---
Just got mine this morning I gave up on it 3 months ago woke up this morning and decided let‚Äôs see if we can get it and got him and the jacket to spawn the first try made me really happy lol
---
I really wish the survival servers were separate characters.  I like the idea of everyone starting from the beginning.  
---
I had too much cover for dust to be seen, and part of the time he was inside a building.
---
It *is* broken if there is no possible way to get your stealth skill high enough to remain undetected, because if you cannot remain undetected, it is *completely useless*.
---
Sadly I don‚Äôt have the escape artist perk,  possibly it‚Äôs to cloaking abilities triggering off on another. The price of Armour was a cloaking one.
---
I think so
---
Yep! Still grinding away XD Finally got Toothy tho!
---
Inventory isn't remotely realistic. You can carry dozens of heavy weapons with Bear Arms but, where exactly are they? In your pockets? Those are some big pockets.  No no wait, in your Bag of Holding? Yes an important item we all got from Vault 76 was a good old fashioned Bag of Holding sewn into the waistband of our underwear. Prove me wrong! You can't take off your underwear, can you? And you never have a "0" weight limit, so where's all this stuff supposed to be stored? In your underwear, that's where.  But if you took all that stuff out of your underwear, it'd have to be somewhere, right? That's why you can only see the weapon you're using.
---
Some of the rewards look good. Nice way to incentivize ppl to play it more.
---
I'm not a PvP fan and will probably rarely, if ever, log in to the Survival servers.  That being said, fellow PvE'ers...what the hell is the problem?  For months, I have seen multiple posts upvoted to the front page of this sub that state slap damage should not exist, that it should do ZERO damage to the person being attacked.  And now that it's being implemented there's an outcry of "this is going to be abused!!!"???
---
Any of the so-called "abuses" listed in the comments are things that players can currently do in the game already, so it's not like zero slap damage is opening a whole new can of worms.  Bethesda gave us what we wanted in regards to slap damage...stop trying to create problems and just revel in it for a while.
---
Gotcha. Do you also have the chameleon mutation? 
---
I think you don't understand how statistics work, if it's 1% then the chances of you seeing it even playing all day, everyday would still be low. 
---
Chances of winning the lotto or getting struck by lightning are also low, but we know that it happens. 
---
We've all seen first hand accounts of people claiming either to have seen or to have received them, but because they're not meeting the arbitrary litmus test on a Reddit thread it's assumed false and lies because people would prefer to believe that it's broken and not just that it's difficult and they haven't obtained it. 
---
As a modder of previous fo games, I can tell you that external scripts can easily adjust drops and it's also highly likely, as they said, that certain variables and conditions need to be met in order for certain drops to even be possible. Perhaps instead of spending so much time trying to prove difficulty, spend that energy experimenting with different environmental variables. 
---
Then you stay in adventure mode.  Hardcore PvP is a no complaining and no mercy zone for all the big kids who wanna kill each other instead of play in the sandbox with all you other people
---
 [https://help.bethesda.net/](https://help.bethesda.net/)  did you all take a screenshot/video of the player and report them?
---
&gt; Even if your addicted you can just take a drink to remove the negatives.
---
The credo of every IRL alcoholic!
---
I agree that it will be a slaughter house BUT in this community there's more good then bad, so you never know. That 20% xp is also there for that reason which they said lol.
---
Fast paced PvP may be dead as we know it. Changes to pacifist and pacifism extending to camps will deter PvPers from that game mode.
---
 I can still server hop looking for owned workshops, then killing those players wherever they are on the map. Farming for caps n junk. 
---
This map is too big. Survival PvP may be SLOW.  I suppose advertising your location will be the best bet but they removed my abilitiy to actively hunt players. Bethesda confused PvP with hardcore survival. We really are going to need mounts, or motorcycles in order get the fast paced PvP im used to in survival mode. Even then id be tearing thru the map aimlessly looking for a fight. Id prefer if our locations were loosely advertised. Like in hunter/hunted a larger red circle over the players location.
---
Right now i can find and get to a battle in less than 5 min on adventure mode with server hopping and fast travel.. I hope the same is true for survival.i wont know if a server is dead or empty. I bet i find myself running around for a half hour or server hopping busy fight spots. Cause we cant see players on the map
---
Pacifism should be punished. -20% xp. 
---
Well people who are going to complain about ganks and workshop flipping are playing wrong gamemode, they should go back to adventure mode. 
---
Am I the only person who only gets sees Helvetia as a bombed nuclear waste zone? Seriously of the 5 times I‚Äôve ‚Äúattempted‚Äù to do it 3 of those have been nuked. At level 35 I‚Äôve only recently got a hazmat suite but that doesn‚Äôt exactly help with survival from the lumbering monsters in the area since I have to take off my armor. Also seriously no clue where you get rad resistant power armor.
---
I guess the thing for me is, I can earn like 10x the exp per hour farming nuked whitesprings efficiently than anywhere else. But that's just asking to be ganked. I guess I also just don't care that much about exp, being level 305.
---
dude, it's ok to like this game, but to completely ignore the myriad bugs the game has is ridiculous...
---
I like smashing camps, getting huge bounties, baiting people into PvP
---
Yeah, if you are the one that purposedly try to take any workshop already claimed.  
---
Moreover, try a bit harder than "it will still happening" without giving out any example to serve your case.
---
Yup. I'm very excited to get killed. 
---
seems like the only people that will be there after a week will all be unkillable gods with sent/cav assassin 
---
Shhh, don't let scare off our food source. I was looking at making out with 100 stims from all these excavator armor kids running around with half their stash.
---
I do not agree.  Not all of my friends want to play survival. 
---
&gt;!I'm doing it now too.. server hopped 5 times, eventually found myself there in the rain, at 2:45 am and there they were.. so dont give up!!&lt;
---
I hit the guy with TWO Nuka Quantum nades and he didn't die \*sigh\*.  
---
And yet Melee players run around 1-hit killing pretty much anyone.  \*grr\*  
---
Stealth players absolutely need some way to counter Berry Mentats, or else they may as well \*\*\*UNINSTALL\*\*\* because the game is turned into a pile of worthless shit for those players (including me).
---
DUPER!!! SHAME HIM!!!! LOL
---
Seems fair
---
Nobody forces you to fast travel 
---
We'll come for you... 
---
Narcissism rule 36: Find an innocent target to blame for things that went wrong on things you support.
---
hopefully this post gets the traction it deserves and notice from u/ladydevann, u/valseek, u/LoneVaultWanderer and u/BethesdaGameStudios_ seeing as a Bethesda dev was "confirming" that these masks were obtainable during their recent stream. 
---
there is a mentat that makes it so other players are highlighted in game, even if they are in stealth
---
They‚Äôll be over there, I‚Äôll be in Adventure mode. Picking flowers and making cookies
---
I really think that that pvp is a flawed system as it is. I don't shy away from it but I don't exactly seek it out either.
---
My biggest beef with this change is that it constitutes a change in vision from what this game was sold as. 
---
We are supposed to be tense meeting other players, and assholes are supposed to be turned into interesting content.
---
And you are right, it does become their problem if they don't learn, but that statement stands true right now as well. People are still going to be complaining about griefers after the change in adventure mode, maybe moreso because now they have an even stronger illusion of being safe.
---
My guess that any sightings of rare masks are people brushing the dust off Dev room stuff they got from previous banned people and are allowing people to assume they got them from the event.
---
Yep, limited time. 5 days
---
I was mistakenly thinking that they had to "Claim" the workshop from me to start the PVP, if I didn't respond to "slaps".
---
Just one thing; should I replace Four Leaf Clover with Psychopath? Which has a better chance of refilling crits?
---
Nah. They just need to server lock junk and aid.  So you cant take junk or aid from adventure to survival. Thats what drops on death. 
---
I wanna bring my gear.
---
The other problem is grinding efficiency. If i needed to grind, its morw efficient in a game mode with fast travel. 
---
Once again server locking junk and aid to the game mode it came from would solve this. 
---
He won't, but the scorchbeast he trains into it totally will.
---
Does Charisma raise chance?
---
i just want plans for the sausage and doughnut
---
Yes by all means lets others know with the Excuse Me I'm Only Testing Something emote.
---
Thanks!  I have 4 levels of rad resistance, but 1 of rad sponge and it seems to only help others.  I don't really team (as username suggests ;-) so I was hoping for a solo method.  I like group events, but not big on teams.  The idea of someone seeing my base and wrecking it kind of bothers me.
---
Thanks though!
---
do you still need the suppressor on your gauss?
---
I'm on the other side of the fence with this lol. UNRESTRICTED RAIDER ROLEPLAY FOREVEERRR
---
You are still treating it like I am seeing it in black and white.  I am not.  The game needs a rebalance with the weapons and perks, at least for the pvp side of things.   Don't imply I haven't thought about this either.  I am just enjoying news that I found to be good. 
---
Literally the solution right now
---
I played for the second time last night and got the same mask? also a beret. I tried to equip the "new mask" and my head went invisible lol it was perty kool actually. Its a fun event though..
---
... what the fuck are you talking about "delivered cheap ass preorder items"?
---
I personally haven't seen any server stability improvements. The game plays slightly smoother, but I still experience 1 or 2 disconnects a session, this has been happening since launch. Someone pointed out the other day that it could be due to the need to server hop, and a large portion of the player base constantly hopping. Which makes sense since its gotten worse with the event, people are hopping to try and get the rare masks which seem to be nearly impossible to get.
---
And you can do that right now. If the solution remains the same did the problem really get fixed?
---
It isn‚Äôt random.
---
I wish, that would rock
---
THANK YOU!  I thought I was crazy, but yes, the numbers were not adding up.  I agree, they should just be transparent so we don't waste time on concepts that don't work as advertised.
---
Absolutely moronic to allow existing characters into survival. 
---
randomly out in the world, not at the workshop
---
Oh shit! I didnt think of that
---
Because sentinel is a secondary you can have both. That would be a kickass set.
---
I must find!
---
Scope is OK from far away, but it's too glitchy.  Half the time when I try to switch to scope mode it only goes "half way" and instead of looking "through" the scope it just blocks my view - this is no good, particularly for an intense battle where your enemy is close, or you're trying to PVP and loosing 100 caps every time they kill you.
---
yongyea vid that fo76 is now a br when
---
I prefer PvE play... but this reminds me of the old Ultima Online split worlds Felucca and Trammel.... LOVE IT!
---
The ability to move between worlds with characters is very nice. Depending on my mood or maybe if I wanna do a challenge and go after some sweet rewards... Yeah, I'm in! 
---
The point is, you shouldn't need to do that.
---
Yeah, that last bit is why I'm not going to do PVP. Back to square 1? Great. But if I'm going to have to fight with the insane level 300s with builds that drop my level 40 ass in one shot, no thanks. Still, good to have the hardcore PVPers off having their fun where it doesn't spoil ours (or theirs). 
---
u/ladydevann
---
It doesn‚Äôt need to be a brand new character, just lock it in survival if you want to switch it other. Even give them one switch back if they don‚Äôt like it. But being able to do it at all times seems like it will bring a lot of issues.
---
I have a feeling the rare masks will start dropping more often towards the end of the week.. for some reason. 
---
 I have an Auto Grenade Launcher I am becoming more and more attached to. 
---
 I put it together for griefers but they are rare. It has a couple of the Luck Stagger perks and all the Explosive perks. My guy is immune to Explosives and inside with a small crowd its just a crazy thing. "Clear the area" No problem, much better than a broom. ;)
---
u/valseek
---
Oh I am absolutely not against the inclusion of the forest area in the game. This ain't serious too. To describe my favorite Fallout location, I cannot deny that place colorfullness. New Reno wasn't exactly monochromatic :p
---
 You can hurt wanted people during the event. I was wanted when I  came to the event and I got smacked lol.
---
I don't have much time now days to play either, but that doesn't mean that they should make it easier for those with limited time to play. It's supposed to be challenging isn't? Now, it's mostly likely going to turn into a deathmatch mode instead of a survival mode, but we still need more info about the survival aspect. For all we know there may be no new challenges making it worth it. And I don't mean the new challenges they talk about. We'll just have to see how they do it.
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer
---
Four leaf clover for sure. FLC can proc on any hit, so if you're spamming a couple vats shots on an enemy you're almost guaranteed for it to refill your crit bar.
---
Psychopath only has a chance to proc on a kill, so it's not really worth it.
---
I use 2 ranks of four leaf clover on my crit/shotgun build, with that and grim reapers Sprint, I honestly have a never ending supply of crits. 
---
u/BethesdaGameStudios_
---
Thanks. I think i remember the hermit crab now actually. Forgot about the fog crawler. Just looked and its scary asüëç 
---
Yeah but there are other solutions. Dont lwt junk or aid from adventure into survival is an example. 
---
I wanna be able to play both modes whenever i want. I also want to killl people woth junk in their pockets!
---
Stealthboys, berry mentats and stims will drop tho. Pvpers all carry them
---
Have you seen how far scorchbeasts path?
---
I'm glad this works. 
---
Stupid mixed drinks!
---
Can you solo with X-01, rad-x (+200) and 4 levels of rad resistence (+40)?  Or do you need radshield (+300, which I believe stacks with rad-x).
---
Radshield is hard to come by, but I'll do it if I have to...
---
It's a problem. No proof showing actual drop at the end of the event.
---
I dont really see the point of not letting characters swap back and forth, even if they didn't it would only delay the fat nerds with there meme weapons for a week or two
---
Very usefull information here, must translate into survival. I am at 600 hours and i didnt had sentinel drop ever, even cavalier was missing. I think maybe theres some system that detects you participate in pvp and manipulates legendary prefix drop around that. I got like 40 3* armor pieces, mostly weightless combat with weight reductions. I think the game is trying to buy me in by droping weightless items, becouse I always stop playing when i get overweight and cannot fast travel. I farm westtek, not so much wintersprings becouse I always get salty of guys who oneshot everything. There should be change to sentinel imho and I would tell you how I think it would be the best changed : Sentinel :  Reduces damage by 75% while staggered or when you have wounded limb. Assasins : Reduces damage taken by players by 10%, Reduces damage of critical shots by enemy players by 8%. All armor would receive new modification for chest piece :  Vats Jam : When instaled gives player V.a.t.s jamming mechanic that last 3 seconds 10sec cooldown. VATS JAM reduces hit chance by 50%.
---
I have an awful lot of PVP experience dealing with those things. It was the factors outside of the norm like the invulnerability to damage and VATS during the event and the very strange "downed" behavior after the event ended  that I was questioning. long story short:
---
The invulnerability during an event while you have a bounty can be exploited, and the downed-state behavior I saw was almost certainly a bug that requires a weapon switch or execution with Cannibal to counter. This doesn't seem widely known, and if you don't know how to respond it gives an unfair advantage, especially to people who have teammates who can keep reviving anyone you manage to down. I have never liked the "downed" state. Things like Life Saving and such should proc IMMEDIATELY on zero health in PVP, imo, or you should just drop dead. None of this having to swap weapons to finish someone nonsense.
---
Regardless of what they do, they should always show you either your crosshair or your sights.
---
Yes I do, I never make use of it though through normal gameplay. 
---
The bit about workshops in Adventure mode could have been written more clearly. I'm reading it that no changes have been made to workshops. If you own one, you can still be shot in the face and killed. Will we still be able to be ganked halfway across the map by a teammate of someone who hit claim on our workshop?
---
Def the best for pve in my opinion. I would go with assassin's sentinel if I were planning to do a lot of pvp.
---
fo76 first comes out 
---
me: eww...fk pvp. i'll avoid it
---
FO76 now
---
me: .....*waits anxiously to press survival*
---
never thought i'd be so excited for a pvp mode.
---
If they are exploiting sure, otherwise you still stand a chance. 
---
Someone has motive to lie about getting it, attention. But not so much motivation to lie about not getting it.
---
Correct Reddit is only a fraction of the gamers playing. But your telling me that the rates are so low that not 1 Reddit user hasn't gotten it and cared to share the information/picture. That's literally thousands. So what, 1 in 5000-10,000 people playing the game gets a mask. Why would the Devs even bother.
---
Wonder if this will make the devs feel more relaxed about being generous with weapon and perk balancing?
---
Really would be interesting to see if adventure mode allows us to feel overpowered like the previous BGS games now that PvP is almost completely separate.
---
Exactly if it‚Äôs named sole survivor then I really can‚Äôt miss it.
---
I would absolutely dislike the game if survival was the default gamemode
---
Doesn‚Äôt sound like workshops changed
---
Why would it have to be a brand new character? Why not just lock in your adventure mode character if you decide to switch it over?
---
Ok, I'm fine with that.  Previously only had 3 missile turrets on my CAMP, now i have 4.  Someone may have done same thing previously, came back to find 3 dead scorchbeasts on my CAMP roof and nothing destroyed.  So bring it.
---
Ahh okay cool thanks
---
Yep, I usually solo no headset, but lately I turned mine on and it adds a whole other dimension of play, especially chill time at camps and when trying to help.the lowbies.  
---
I did my first one completely solo last night and it didn't have the decorating one. I had the Music one, the Historian, the Woodsman, The Beekeeper and the Candle Maker.
---
Good choice Bethesda. Thanks!
---
And I'm fine with that!  Have fun on the PVP servers!
---
Then have fun playing with the big kids. I'm gonna go build a sand castle.
---
Nah, not having to create new character for Survival Mode is great. As player who came on day one and has spent 100+ hours into developing &amp; gearing character, not my fault other players came 120 days later and now complain how they aren't as geared as those who started day one.
---
And as one of those people, I get it, but I also don't expect to immediately get rares just because I've got a full life. It's rare for a reason and generally grindy rares like this are exclusive for the incredibly lucky or those with a lot of time. 
---
I've also heard that in game luck plays a role, similar to preserved pie from some of the data diggers in the mod group but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è yrmv.
---
The ppl bitching about trades happens to me all the time. Like first off try to have a mic on so I kno what the hell u want and second if I say na I don‚Äôt have anything I wanna sell, don‚Äôt keep asking me then offering ur garbage like it‚Äôs a fair deal. 
---
Maybe if that chance was just for the Old Man Winter Mask and the other 4 rare masks had a really small drop precentage like 5% 4% 3% and 2% then I could approve of it. 
---
Get ready for a bunch of dudes jumping up and down firing AAEs at each other.
---
The problem is that it is now pointless. What's the point in having survival mode if you can just transfer back to adventure mode? It's basically deathmatch mode because nobody with half a brain will quest in this mode. It will be used purely for trolling and fighting.
---
I was using T-60 without any other rad protection only with using of radaways. Later we found out that radsponge perk. And for solo you can take perk that heals your rad damage when it is daytime.
---
You don't need any rad-x (that shit cancels mutations by its duration) or rad rezist perk.
---
If I had to start over to play Survival, I probably wouldn't come back to the game lol
---
I had a tamed wolf, but there is a player who hunt down my camp and kills my pets. Yes you can have both. 
---
You got the Owl from the event? I really like that one, saw somebody wearing it yesterday. I got the witch 2x but if I have a chance of getting the owl I'm gonna give it another few tries! 
---
I only did the quest 3 times but quit when 2 out of 3 plans were the same and two of the least sought after masks.  The parade and the lighting of the bonfire feel like some dumb pagan ritual paying tribute to the RNG Gods in the hopes of getting better loot.  Fuck that. 
---
The notion of "rare drops" with this event is ridiculous to begin with.  Because it only lasts one week, anything obtained is 'rare' because of that reason alone.
---
Yeah it really should be new characters, without the ability to jump between modes.
---
Farming legendaries in pve land with zero risk will probably be the rule rather than the exception because of this.
---
What is your farming technique now for 3 star armor?
---
I've noticed more 3 star stuff the more people are around plus better quality in watoga. Whitesprings is mostly 1 star stuff ive noticed
---
Thank you. And fuck that guy.
---
Nothing random about it. When you take a workshop you do so with the knowledge that if someone contests, you‚Äôre flagged no matter where you are. You made that choice. Expect PvP. 
---
This. I just don't see the point guys, I'm sorry. There will be no build diversity. You either run a godmode assn/sent bloodied stealth sniper that one shots people, or you run a godmode assn/cav bloodied melee character that sprints at people and kills them. PvP will be decided by who sees who first. Popular farming spots will be off limits. Doing events like SBQ will not be possible unless it forces everyone onto a team. The only reason to ever play on this is to exclusively do pvp, which sounds like it's going to be hard to find players. You're rewarded for surviving, not killing (which is kinda cool I guess), so you're encouraged to hole up in some out of the way place and just stay there.
---
20% exp is nothing when you consider that the best farming spots will be off limits and you'd normally get 10x more exp by farming efficiently at whitesprings, west-tek, etc. Any exp gained will be lost when you have to run all the way back to your farm spot.
---
Micro-managing my caps and aid items so that my losses are minimal doesn't sound like a good time either.
---
Also can't forget that if you want to be competitive on this server, you have to run one of two builds, and neither one is efficient for farming pve stuff. 
---
I do like a lot of the changes here, but overall it seems like the ebay kids that bought a full assn/sent gear from a duper are the only ones that will have any 'fun'.
---
Video game designers have no clue then, because every FPS game I've tried - in situations where IRL would basically be "can't miss" somehow you still miss WAY too much.
---
So frustrating to be in a halway, 5 - 10 feet from an enemy, have your rifle aimed dead center, then MISS MISS MISS - f'ing ludicrous!!!
---
The thing I like about Fallout games is that when you're in "AIM" mode, the bullets always go WHERE THE GUN IS AIMED!  So it actually relies on your skill, not on some unrealistic bulletspread/kickback calculations which make the bullet go NOT where the gun is pointed.  That's not how kickback works, it CHANGES WHERE the GUN IS POINTED, which you could SEE IRL.  My gun kets knocked off aim wildly, I'll be able to SEE that it's not pointed at my target and have to correct.
---
I know that think looks dirty. Good news, you'll have a few weeks of 20% bonus XP to grind out those levels
---
What level are you, and I can help you from there.
---
‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre telling me there‚Äôs a chance‚Äù - Lloyd Christmas 
---
i also think making survival mode start fresh seems to be a good idea
---
Give me a reason you start pvp mode so I can use that +20%. After level 50 that's sorta not worth much. 
---
Now pvp mode with be sentinel build jumping up and down shooting at each other's feet which is BORING and not stream worthy. 
---
Did it go past you that they've scammed people with the preorder bags and only "made it up to them" after it was made public literally everywhere?
---

---
There you go. First result out of hundrets on google.
---
I agree should be like fallout 4, separate character saves. But I would not say that duping problem is quite squashed yet. Still finding plenty of overpowered weapons for sale.
---
They don't HAVE level 79 Super Mutants?!?  At least not for me, I'm over level 100 and I've never seen a single Super Mutant over level 68 :(
---
It's not really a big deal to me and there is an extremely simple solution. You can put a scope on or you can stop running a build that turns your weapon invisible
---
Trust me, if I knew exactly who it was..... his camp would be leveled over and over. 
---
Yup, instantly kills the mode for me
---
If you're on Windows 10 you should use the built-in game recorder (Win-Alt-R) and make a video of it, this way you can have evidence to report the griefing.
---
Cheers bro have a good fun
---
This.  There is absolutely no reason for the 'claim-fail' griefing system to currently work as it does.

The system should require you to fully claim the workshop and have it open to the owner to come defend it through the first defense quest.  After that, you own the workshop.    If you leave before that, DC or choose not to continue in any way, it reverts back to the original owner and you cannot engage in PvP with them.  Only members of a team that are within the workshop area are allowed to attack/defend against the original owner(s), and only while the claim system is underway.  No hunting them down across the map.  It's obvious they don't care to hold it.
---
So far I've gotten the Knight and Knight CAPT. Some guy painted my armor Elder for me cause no one seems to have Paladin for PC yet. I wear BoS combat armor but before then I've gotten Initiate while wearing marine armor (before they stopped dropping Initiate)
---
Ps4?
---
I have gotten 3 toothy man masks and I've done the quest six times.
---
no but your wording was shit. I thought you were referring to players not Bethesda.
---
Or both, to different degrees.   
---
Level 1 starting a new character 
---
Rofl yeah I had one squeaker harassing me for my ultracite armor.
---
My theory is that it won't be completable until Nuclear Winter and I reckon that's when we'll get to meet the Overseer as well as other NPC's. This is what I'm hoping for anyways. 
---
Sweetness! (:
---
Bandolier perk reduces weight of ammo by 90%, I don‚Äôt play without it. Your argument is disingenuous.
---
ever think maybe I can't afford or don't want to buy atoms in a game I was told I wouldn't be required to?
---
Game grinding when I was a kid: Deliver these flowers to the pits of Mordor where the mystical Druid will reveal himself as a dragon wizard. He will then give you a llama which you will have to escort to a bed of roses so it transform into princess Penelope and give you the mystical bow of Auir. 
---
Game grinding now: Kill this bad guy over and over again for a 0.00000000000001% chance to get the object you need to advance, and never get the object 
---
Its crazy to me that they arent requiring new characters the community literally begged for it since survival was announced. They almost pulled me back into the game but I guess Im back to waiting for sekiro tonight.
---
Are you really suggest to play without Fastnacht masks? No way!
---
yes, because i took a WORKSHOP. the WORKSHOP initiates PVP.  It tells us when we take the WORKSHOP we are opening ourselves upt o pvp. THE WORKSHOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
so doesnt it make sense the PvP should be in the WORKSHOP?
---
not finding someone at a vendor and killing them.  not finding someone at their CAMP.
---
im sure you understand this, but just want to be confrontational.  
---
Energy weapons can no longer spawn with the explosive effect.  I believe that was in the TSE nerf patch.
---
If you have a legacy weapon from the fabled days of yore.  I'd guess you can name your price for it.
---
My explosive Tesla rifle is NOT for sale.
---
I suppose if everyone is able to abuse the swapping between modes, then it kinda balances out on its own lol. The meta will be play as long as you can in PvP and switch back to pve to restock. Rinse and repeat
---
I run a ranged build with no pa and rarely suffer from rads. I hop in the decontamination shower maybe once every couple sessions. If I get swamped by ghouls I might do it more, but the solution is to kill them before they can irradiate me. In nuke zones I usually just run a hazmat suit and decontaminate after
---
The problem with most video games is how they implement kickback and (sometimes) hyper-exaggerate "bullet spread".
---
If you're going to do kickback, change where the GUN IS POINTED!!! (not just where the bullet goes).
---
So tired of being in a hallway about 8 feet from enemy, gun is clearly pointed dead center, yet somehow the bullet misses.  I'm not "special ops" but I have fired an AR15 and 8 feet away, standing in a hallway is basically "can't miss" range unless you're incompetent, or so scared that you're pissing your pants and shaking - even still, you'd mostly hit under those circumstances anyway!
---
Cant wait to be running around an empty SURVIVAL server looking for a player to fight... 
---
We need a list or a displayed server population if we cant see players on the map.
---
I think you're misunderstanding. Despite server hopping or not looting and area for 24-48 hours the issue is loose junk is clearly visible as if lootable. Once you try to take it, it won't register. Soon after that item as well as every other loose item in the room disappears. What's basically happening is that the game or area is loading with loose junk visible in their assigned locations but the data later catches up and removes the already looted item long after your walking around. It's not instantaneous. You could be exploring a room and see items vanishing. 
---
1. This is not an MMO.
---
2. Just because Wow had the same shitty idea doesn't mean this game should. 
---
Darkish gray with white under, insignia is two vertical parallel red strips with 3 stars between and wings on the outside of the red lines if memory serves. Some kind fellow painted my T60 Elder but I don't use power armor often to remember 
---
again... the event isn't over yet. At least wait till the end of it so we can determine how rare they really are.
---
 Its useless. I had a 2 Star and sold it to Wallace.
---
 Its insanely inaccurate. I could not do anything to fix it and I can mod any Combat Shotgun, with everything available.
---
Couldn't have said it better my self lol
---
Jiggaman89 but only lvl 70 something
---
I think one of the steps would be to acquire a black powder rifle. I could be wrong though.
---
I mean, those would be cool too! 
---
Isn't 1% like 1 out of hundred or something? What am I understanding wrong?
---
Because not every one of my friends want to play survival.  And I would still like to be able to play with them.  
---
Now, how to dip into Survival mode just to pick up the Lever action.
---
Psn Deathgod905

---
Played for hours last night, mostly on one server (hopped once for another reason, not disconnected). Multiple Faschnat events.   Not one stability or performance issue.  PC.  
---
Me and my friend will join
---
Thanks, I must have misread that part. 
---
Especially if they came from the dev room glitch.
---
Ya
---
I got plenty of pictures
---
If you claim a workshop it can still happen. 
---
If you shoot another player accidentally with pacifist off it will still happen. 
---
If you team up with someone who is hostile to other players or owns a workshop it will still happen. 
---
If you accidentally open a player owned lock it will still happen.
---
If you are farming plastic plates in the Watoga high school it will still happen.
---
There are so many ways you can still get flagged hostile and die repeatedly. Survival mode might actually be better at preventing that because of restricted respawn.
---
The DLC road map did say that more main quests would be coming in the third wave of DLC . So that is possible.
---
Not only longer loads, I'm getting booted from the game a LOT more. I'll get a stutter, then everything onscreen freezes, and I know a dc is coming, then up pops the disconnected from server message.
---
Yes, I have no friends ;-)  thank you for tailoring your comment to someone like me.
---
So, they all stack?  Thanks to castroblasto I know "Fermentable Lead Champagne. Craftable in the Brewing Station.
---
Requires: 3 Boiled Water, 2 Lead, 1 Nuclear Material, 3 Tarberry, 5 Wood.
---
Recipe is given by Biv E. Rage (robot in the tattoo parlor) on random chance day so that you can make one for him. May or May not be able to get the recipe somewhere else, but I haven't seen or heard of anywhere."
---
Is 500 enough though?  I can add 453 with my x-01, and 4 levels for rad resistance for 993... do I need 1000?
---
Not having friends is pricey... lead champagne and radshield will require grinding...
---
If you're talking about the power armor person in the right, that is the giant mask (in North America). It seems some localizations have different names for a couple of the masks. I've got three of them. 
---
Yeah he was taunting the entire time while doing this
---
I know you are taking the piss but now that you've said it..... I genuinely would prefer that Bethesda does go under than see them release TES6 in a similar manner as FO76. 
---
Then just make a pvp battle arena if that‚Äôs what they want. 
---
Their intention is to make a fully functional hardcore mode. Hardcore mode that you can run away from at any time feels like an oxymoron. 
---
Those will still both be happening in adventure mode
---
Yeah otherwise I would agree with you normally. 
---
I do hope there is a certain cap amount that has to be placed on a bounty though. So people who die can't place 1 cap bounties to reveal location.
---
&gt;Perhaps instead of spending so much time trying to prove difficulty, spend that energy experimenting with different environmental variables.
---
It's a team event. You can't control other players' actions.
---
Envy!
---
Currently is not relative though. Currently means as of right now. To say its currently available means that its available right now as soon as this event started 
---
except cheaters aren't innocent... Also, it's more likely that they're spacing them out so that people will continue to play the event till it goes away rather than just for the first day it's out. I did say it was just speculation anyways...
---
I want a monitor with built in hardware zoom - like a footswitch w/two levels of pressing.  Light click is 2x zoom and harder fully pressed click is higher zoom...
---
Would help my old eyes, kids these days can hit one pixel from accross a mile wide map, somehow (I assume they're not all cheating w/aimbots?)
---
Right, the same solution for the problem as it is. The solution is already in the game without changing anything.
---
Already know a location that has one but if that fails I could always get one from my friend 
---
Not naivity. Knowledge. The event doesn't wait for the robots. It waits for Event Coordinator. Thats why you could potentially hold all robots in the starting place. Mr handy would go to his points, trigger the Monsters, continue around till the end. I've done multiple times where I kept the robot back for testing. The monsters still trigger. They don't wait for the robots. I've had it happen with robots at the end also.
---
He could've been a troll, but people could've assumed I was troll when I was trying to do tests on the outcomes depending on robots killed.
---
Truth is. You don't know.
---
You didn't know him. You didn't interview him after on what he hoped to achieve. You assumed with a lack of knowledge.
---
 Make workshops co-op zones not pvp zones. Let's build together.
---
Yeah, it is not a well thought out decision
---
LOL.  Actually, I am enjoying all of the rest of the map and the stories.  And I can do that irritating thing of running in to the zone, grabbing a few things, then running out.  I just know that spawns additional hassle for the people who created the zone and don't want to be a jerk.  If I create the spawn, I'd like to help them remove it.
---
It's one of the common masks.
---
I've had your method happen to me ([and filmed it](https://xboxclips.com/Ruleryak/d2dd428b-d85a-460b-b681-5eb490ba534a)) completely by accident a few times.  Very disorienting to be outside the map all of a sudden.
---
What got fixed was different - there was going too far into your armor ([like this](https://xboxclips.com/Ruleryak/a35250bf-76b9-4a47-b056-bea77e3326e8)) and there was putting your armor up inside the ceiling and then getting inside (which I thought I had a clip of, but can't seem to find at the moment).
---
Yeah I don't like how you can just take your built up guy and be OP from day one, or in reverse run away to the safe mode when you are getting your butt kicked.  
---
Alright.
---
I am interested in Survival mode for my lvl 20 ish character and that EXP bonus, but i'm still afraid of those one shot lvl 200+ players :(
---
They weren't too nice to me in regular 76 anyway. Guess i'll constantly keep my junk in my stash.
---
The text is posted so people at work can read it if you want to read the article google it nerd
---
My first thought too!
---
I have never seen that. I have 6 missile turrets and the scorchbeasts roast my camp
---
Who cares
---
"take perk that heals your rad damage when it is daytime"
---
Great point, thanks!
---
Can I be the janitor?
---
IDK man, those people.. I've yet to see someone like that in 300+ hours. Maybe it's just less common on PC. The rare time that I've had a guy that wouldn't leave me alone (happened like twice so far), I left the server and went on with my day.
---
You **can** ***hide/be stealthy*** IRL. Duh? I actually hid in the shadows (without full cover) and stood motionless as a police officer walked past me less than 2 feet away.  He did not see me.  (Yes, he was actively looking for me, I was the reason he was there).  
---
When I was young and foolish I was somewhere I was not supposed to be and tripped the alarm.  No one was hurt by my crime and I have since stopped that kind of bad behavior - now my crimes are limited to speeding and sometimes downloading a movie (shh, don't tell them!).
---
fo/bazzar
---
How would a griefer use the no slap damage to their advantage? 
---
It‚Äôs lonely, I imagine 
---
Yeah, there‚Äôs even programs that will do that too
---
I'm saving up for the plans for the Black Powder weapons from White Springs :) 
---
r/fobazaar
---
Thanks. OP's text didn't come out well on my screen and was difficult to read.
---
I can certainly see the pros &amp; cons of each option, so the best one is ultimately subjective from person to person. I‚Äôm just interested in any insight they can provide regarding how they came to their decision
---
Just telling you what the Devs have said. Unfortunately, Bethesda provides us no information, so that's all we got
---
As good? Depends on if the gatling laser has a decent legendary effect. If it's a base one, no. As fun? Absolutely! 
---
I would give you Gold, if I had some.  Reddit is infested with idiots these days, downvoting anything they don't understand.
---
You might want the donut plan for completionist sake, but I can pretty much guarantee you'll never use it. The recipe is something insane line 2 brahmin milk, 2 radtoad eggs, some razorgrain flour, salt, 2 spices, and something else I'm forgetting, and the end result is a food item that heals for 25hp. That's it. You could just cook one radtoad omelette and get the same 25hp *plus* a +1 END buff.
---
You can put a refined .50 receiver on the hunting rifle that gives the best ammo production for a 2 pt dmg reduction over the hardened .308.
---
It's what I have on mine.
---
Doesn't help the fire rate though
---
Now, see this is different. If you were there and he was doing it like this. Then it's clearly something different.
---
I love choosing perk cards and I am excited for a chance to do it 20% faster.
---
Thank you just got my first tesla rifle from a SB couldn't  believe it and got myself another prime lever happy days 
---
I have 2 berets, and I tend to kill a ton of suicide bombers.  That may be the connection, and why you got one that time.
---
Meh rewards. I'll keep the Auto Grenade Launcher, and my Instigating Level Action is head and shoulders above that Sole Survivor Click Bait.
---
Holy shit those rewards are pretty cool. I like that there is some incentive now to play that mode beyond wanting to become a full time raider/griefer. I'll definitely check the mode out for the lever action fat man and 50 cal... still worried about my base though 
---
&gt; having someone else contest your own will open you up to hostility with that player.
---
not really, they still arent fixing the stupid workshop pvp exploit
---
Oh yeah im aware of that, the closer you are the better yout hip fire accuracy should be
---
Gatling is too slow if you're getting mobbed. But it's great otherwise. Mine isn't even fully modded. 
---
Farming in adventure, and then heading over to survival... will bring out the WORST in a certain subset of gamers.
---
I like the PvP free for all after the event. I SLAP everyone as soon as its over.
---
I wondered that too.  First time, I thought we'd failed, but nope.  Just a weird post event wave.  Dunno if any bots died.
---
Haha. Well I can understand that since you're 3 times my level. 
---
Honestly if they come back they should wipe their stash and camps. 
---
Oh they are if they're not using third party programms.
---
As a dev you can't blame anyone but yourself when people do things in a game said game is intendet to do.
---
This. There's absolutely no reason to play on this mode other than to bring your full assn/sent bloodied stealth sniper and camp for people. Anyone doing anything else on this server will just be fodder for the ebay kids and dupers. And as soon as the fodder realizes what they are and that they have no chance, they will go back to adventure mode, and survival will be nothing but unkillable gods camping popular farm spots praying for the next moron who for some reason tried survival mode.
---
Why would they waste their time to have the exact same result in 3 weeks. What I meant by that is a lvl 55 can have the exact same build as lvl 300. As far as items well there is still duping in game so only their group would have the best of the best then. At least now the same items they have are available to you. If you get what your asking for you would have zero chance.
---
I do not agree with you.  This subreddit is full of people who are not the average player.  Reddit is the minority.  Most people do not have time to play more than one character.  I am happy they are letting us play with our same characters.  
---
That‚Äôs a valid reason to allow it, I‚Äôll give you that.
---
The best solution to keep everyone happy is to keep loot/stash separate between the modes. But that is like doubling the server load, and we will never see that happening. 
---
I always put my camp near the snake on the map at Whitesprings. 
---
Far enough away that nukes aren‚Äôt an issue. Super flat ground. Green grass!! A little lake nearby too. 
---
I've focused my character development primarily on Stealth - I'm over level 100 now and really liked this game.
---
But, PVP situations are typically so bad that it's "game breaking" for me and it's really frustrating.
---
They simply need to allow SOME kind of way for players heavily invested in stealth to be able to ACTUALLY USE IT, let us have some way to still hide from "Berry Mentats" or else the game is ruined and broken for us.
---
Someone else said they got one after killing a bunch of suicide bombers.  Could that be it?  I go nuts on those things.  They could wipe out the whole event.  
---
Do you usually tackle a bunch?  I've often taken down around half a dozen solo.
---
Won't let me view community
---
Pistols work better. The Rifle does hit harder but takes much longer to reload. For DPS the Pistols rule. Go ahead pull out your stupid Dragon, but Pistols out DPS it by a wide margin.
---
Thanks leave that server it was horrible.  
---
That would be super cool. But each time I tried it when nuked, we failed. 
---
Exactly! Such a shame as this could have been a lot of fun.  
---
I was expecting fresh starts, harder PVE and more scarce loot along with full PVP. I thought this was going to be the brutal experience for those of us who want the challenge and it nearly was.
---
There is a small unmarked pond to the south west of the vault that looks nice
---
Eh, only time I claim one is for a Challenge, there's nothing in them that is so critical I can't get anywhere else.  The only exception might be to farm Fusion Cores.  And when I'm done with the workshop I server hop to give up control and any chance of being attacked.  I'm good with that.  They have to give some way for workshops to be turned over.
---
How about being wanted on adventure mode gives you -20% xp, so that incentivizes pvp'ers to play on survival mode to get a bonus +20% xp and leaves pacifism players alone.
---
Example scenario: Not all of my friends want to play survival, but I do.  Being able to go between them with one character (I do not have time to grind another) is a good option for me.  
---
Ah, I never knew that. That's cool.    
---
Still, workshops can't be shared by more than one player as fast travel points and it everyone does full damage to each other. It's all designed to push you to kill each other. So I guess what I was thinking is still a little different.       
---
I never tried pulling resources from someone else's extractor though.
---
Stealth is basically shitty in almost ALL FPS games - no matter how many "points" you invest or gear you get, it's always somehow rendered completely useless.
---
I suppose ghillie suits work on noobs in PUBG, but some players still ALWAYS INSTANTLY spot you, somehow.
---
My camp overlooks flatwoods
---
But if you read the comments, people are calling it bullshit, unacceptable, and much more. Even the OP.
---
That isn't just wanting to know the size of the target is. Being upset because the system doesn't favor you, that's what entitlement is.
---
They are correct, player to player want possible. I had proposed a business where we would facilitate trades as a middleman for just this reason and the scanners lying about the 2 and 3 star perks
---
The top three players will be on the map
---
Hey sorry wasn‚Äôt able to link up yesterday, will you be on today or should I still get in touch with alphafoxwolf?
---
They had a chance to bring new players in and old players back with a fresh start but instead they chose to cater to the already small and slowly dwindling existing playerbase. It will hurt the game in the longterm.
---
That's because I'm an idiot. It is r/fo76bazaar. Sorry.
---
So typically a sought after max lvl 1\* item will sell for 1-2k caps. That being said, I would peg this gun (if max lvl and 1\*) at 500-800 caps.
---
Couple gun drops seems pretty weak. 
---
It‚Äôs suppose to be a fluid movement. Wanna build your camp or take it easy, go to adventure mode. Wanna fight and struggle in PvP, go to survival. 
---
They‚Äôre not suppose to be different worlds. Don‚Äôt be a baby about it. If anything, the fluid movement will just enable PvP‚Äôrs to be concentrated on survival and leave PvE players in peace on adventure.
---
Ohhhh  same masks though?
---
I could see the fun in a nuked march then...  sad that the lower tiers get radiated out, but at least is isn't that someone is trying to deprive EVERYONE of a little fun.
---
Jesus dude. The circlejerk has completely taken you over. 
---
PvPers dont want experience. Especially if they have a bounty. 
---
Pacifists shouldnt be allowed to own workshops either.
---
It's for bragging rights. 
---
Of course, they are just calling it beta.
---
You have a goblin? That you got from the event?
---
I have mine on the little lake next to Silo Alpha. This has a beautiful little pond with plenty of farmland and a pet Yao Guai that guards the perimeter. 
---
It runs fine. 
---
We can only pray for a nuclear winter I guess.
---
That is the way to fix the situation. Block them and leave server. But that is the fix right now. I guess I just don't see the point in shaking up the code for a problem where the solution stays the same.
---
The best armor pieces I've gotten have been from West tech and the awol armorments event. I highly recommend doing that one as often as possible. The event seems to drop better gear if more people are doing it.
---
Whitesprings was great way back pre patch 2 or so for drops, then it was cut back and now is mostly dead. All I see anymore is one and two star stuff, with the occasional 3 star you couldn't pay someone else to take.
---
I might be on my own on this one but I feel that the  UNIQUE CHALLENGES, LEGENDARY REWARDS are not that unique or legendary. I feel like I have legiondaries that are better than these from just killing mobs. 
---
I could always use both I mean I have 56 perks points to spend so I‚Äôm sure I could squeeze a pistol perk in here and there still not sure 
---
There are so many cry babies like you on here today
---
&gt; be possible to deny people the use of their own services in their own camp indefinitely with zero threat of recourse for example.
---
Example?
---
And the Level 22 Assaultrons in Watoga are like kittens compared to the Dominators that you'll see spawn in at Level 50+.  Good for crafting robot helmets, though.
---
I don't agree. I like that you can choose which mode to play in every time you log in. I prefer PvE, but will I go to Survival mode if you dangle a sweet reward in my face? Yes, yes I will... as long as I can bring it back to Adventure mode with me.  That's the draw.
---
As far as people getting one-shotted, starting over will only reduce that chance for those of us playing it now... brand new... but in the future, there will always be someone more powerful than you. You can only "start out with an equal playing field" once. 
---
This reminds me of back in the day when Ultima Online gave us a non-pvp mirrored world of the current pvp one... we were still able to travel back and forth between the two. The rewards from the Felucca (pvp-side) were better because of the higher risks. It was fantastic. 
---
Even still, you're far better off farming nuked whitesprings with no risk and no runback time. Get a friend, do loops around it, reload to respawn everything.
---
Google "fallout 76 interactive map" clear all locations in categories the select. Junk pile under resources.
---
Building a camp in these places grant you unlimited junk. I liked across from the top of the world. Its near a merchant and a great water source
---
How does it remove your ability to hunt players? The top 3 players of every scoreboard will all have their locations displayed. Youll have at least 6 different people to hunt at any give time. Then if you get enough kills/survive long enough you will be hunted.
---
You probably see the other players on social tab.
---
https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10215416571144880&amp;l=704b9db1cc
---
Or have respective servers. Level 20 and below one server, level 21-49 another, and 50+ for anyone else. When you get to the respective level, your world will detect this and reload you unto the proper server dedicated for that level. Each server has its own reward and leaderboard but the items are set at 20, 30-45, and 50.
---
After maybe 75 marches I just got the fasnacht beret, is this a rare? I've not noticed it before.
---
Very fair point!
---
Using a workbench and not getting off it 
---
Ok someone to hunt. Thats a start. Id still like to know the displayed server population. 
---
"12 players on this server"
---
Or
---
"4 players on this server" so i know if its just me and my gang on the server. .
---
Same here.  Figured others would have that issue. 
---
It's easy to say that in Fallout 4 but when you are competing for resources with out players in 76 you are forced to fast travel or you will not be able to compete for them.
---
By the time you arrive at a popular event on foot it will most likely be over.
---
Good god man, who did you manage to piss off so badly that something like this has happened to you. Blocking Vendors and workbenches really, just fast travel somewhere else, its not like they going to be able to preempt where you will be next. 
---
The game has been crashing all along for me on PS4. I have yet to see any improvements on that whatsoever. 
---
As it stands, someone could take their previously owned God-rolled legendary gear into Survival and not have much risk.  But if it were separate, people wouldn't be able to farm that gear nearly as easily as Adventure due to other players always being around the farming spots.  It would take players twice as long to collect their preferred set of armor and weapons since they would have to actively combat each other and the environment, which is exactly how it should be.  Nobody should be able to start up a new pvp mode and already be fully geared.
---
I play on the X, my gf on the S, there's a barely noticeable difference! 
---
Sorry to be unclear. What I meant was, 1) the Beret is not a mask (which is what this topic is about) and 2) the Beret is in the secondary rewards pool. It has a rarity of 1/16.
---
So yes, if you received 1 during 20 runs, that seems about right. I've done 50 runs and only received 1 so far as well.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and pretty new to the game yet I‚Äôve had it since preorder. CYONIDESEROM is my gt. Stopped playing because none of my friends enjoyed it! 
---
I get very jumpy frame rates in the cranberry bog on XB
---
Sorry man. Not that much. They are selling for like 500-1000caps. I've gotten 4 of them
---
It's a massively multiplayer online game, regardless of what you think.
---
 Cause they feel empty inside
---
Ganking can't happen in Adventure mode.
---
Honestly those scorchbeasts were probably killed around your camp and crashed there. They rarely fall directly where they are killed

Grabbed stuff at one event, but then it wouldn't let me donate it all at the next event (on a different server) UNTIL I picked up one from that server, then it took all of that. Case in point: cleared out the wood shed, wouldn't let me donate to the bonfire. Grabbed some from one log near the church and VIOLA it let me donate all the wood with that.
---
I play FO76 on a day 1 edition Xbox and it‚Äôs fine for me üëç
---
Thanks I'll add those places to my rotation!
---
As a pure melee build with radicool i never really bother i guess. 
---
As for meds.. i have 100x of rad x. Rad away. And over 100 stimpacks. I sell them non stop to vendors so caps always flowin. 
---
If ya need chems wont joke pharmafarmer is the absolute shit!
---
The problem is the "risks" in the Fallout 76 survival mode are very minor and basically mean nothing. 
---
Yeah this is pretty sweet. Everybody should get what they want. I'm looking forward to massive and unrelenting paranoia. 
---
I never used a single mod
---
Everyone seems to go here, my lil slice of heaven has been ruined by ‚ÄòSomeone‚Äôs camp is already here, find another server?‚Äô Messages. I think Jug caused a lot of traffic to it
---
All good. 
---
That happens when you get one of the hats that equips all of the same style hats, so the original faschnacht mask, the dirty army helmet, the asylum workers hat. those are the ones off the top of my head. 
---
Not really, people were able to level super fast and progress super fast due to exploits and bugs. A fresh start without xp glitching, server hopping, duping, etc. Means people can finally play the game from start to finished in a balanced environment. The fact that server hopping doesnt respawn items alone will make it take twice as long to progress as it did.
---
Not the same ppl but like I said I guess thats some ppls play style and there‚Äôs really nothing you can do, the two I‚Äôm talking about really had a plan lol they destroyed my camp together then claimed each others bounty to get them out of being wanted so I couldn‚Äôt do anything until they initiated on me. Then like I said the gang up started .. it‚Äôs whatever tho, it‚Äôs how certain ppl want to play 
---
That poor sloth, I never participate in the ritualistic slaughter of the beautiful beast.
---
Wait it out. Most times, it has turned to a meat pile and then I've been able to loot. Once or twice it has just straight up disappeared.
---
Ok. Then don't play stealth builds. Mine is working pretty well for me so far. 
---
Dense marine mod is at watoga station vendor
---
Bethesda, please don‚Äôt fulfill these sickos fantasies 
---
Lol love this
---
As others have said, the Megasloth at the end of the Fasnacht event will sometimes be unlootable for me until it turns into a meat pile. Once it meat piles it is fully lootable.
---
Only thing that changed is amound of people on events. It is hard for few lowbies.
---
Failed today 3 out of 4 times.
---
Unless you are on a team with someone who owns a workshop. Or you accidentally shoot another player. Or you are in any of the versus zones, or you have claimed a workshop.
---
You can totally gank someone across the map and blow up their camp if they are flagged hostile and there are still plenty of ways that can happen
---
I will take the mask but I don't want it for free I can give i something u may need I'm new to the game only lol 14 or something along those lines
---
I know a guy from the discord who has the old man mask and another guy I play with has seen a few others with it and the sun mask.
---
2 shot rifles are still decent but fail in vats.. the 2nd projectile just.. i dunno where it goes but yeah.
---
Aim without vats and 2shot rifles are good.
---
I have no problem with items like this being super rare, it helps to start building a good cosmetic trading market. 
---
Being able to get everything or build/craft everything would seriously limit the growth of that kind of market. 
---
The arbitrary litmus test is a picture of their character wearing the supposed mask. That is not an unreasonable request.  
---
Yeah, I get that. But I guess that's subjective? For me, someone that prefers not to engage in PvP... the "risks" are just that... confrontation. 
---
&gt; Weapons will be "more deadly", but you're "less likely to be one shot".
---
Yeah that's odd. Sounds like reduced damage but higher rate of fire. Unless it's more deadly to enviroment but less againts players. Hmm no, nothing makes it sound right.
---
lvl 39 right now, but I'm new to gaming (only 3-4 months now), my leveling has mostly been because I play with friends. Most everyone else I play with is lvl 55+. 
---
I guess it's not a problem. Using the emoticons on the wheel is also good for quick responses to questions and affirmations. But yeah, ps messages is ok if not in the midst of battle. :-)
---
Ill take three days of not getting killed by kitted out players vs getting killed by kitted out characters immediately any day.
---
Happened to me but was a great photo op!
---
 To who? Everyone has their ears off anyway. A skin on my Lever Action makes more sense.
---
yes, loading performance rolled back to prior patch behavior. It was fixed and better last patch
---
But if the drop rate we're increased..... Everyone would get all the masks too.
---
It depends. South of the Whitespring Clubhouse is one of my favorite locations. I also really liked camping by the giant crashed space station (still remember the code to get the spacesuits cause I got them for tons of low level characters, 111418). 
---
However, since this new event, I‚Äôm digging this little flat spot just west of Helvetia, on the road near the old man winter effigy. Lots of visitors which is perfect for the trading post type store I‚Äôve built. 
---
Almost as effective as the "It's just a social experiment, bro." excuse.
---
Yeah I gave it 10 minutes the first time and nothing, so didn't bother the other times. 
---
He only gives a one star anyways, and twice now he has had no legendary at all (even though that is meant to be patched). 
---
It's a trap! Lol. I knew this as others were flipping out and screaming in the forums. Have faith in Bethesda they will get it right eventually. They always do or the modding community does for them. Lol
---
Well for one, I believe that it's a 0.01 chance so you're confusing odds and probabilities. A coin is heads or tails but that doesn't make it a 50/50 chance. 
---
I am sure it will still happen. Imo that will just increase the excitement of pvp when you do find it though
---
Just find someone in the discord willing to hold the vendor while you keep hopping the same server. his inventory will reset each time you relog
---
It does though, you can still be one shot by explosive weapons in current game, straight through pacifist, happens to me almost every single time I play 
---
Southern part of the map, between the Lewisburg and R&amp;G Stations. Not too much in the way of player traffic nor beasts to destroy your camp. I stay towards the Lewsiburg side to avoid the SB that spawns up in the mountains. Semi close to both the stations for sale purposes, then can easily do a Watoga/BOS vendor/Harper's Ferry run as well. Plus, it gives me a southern point to go to since you can travel to Vault 76 for free, so I usually try to be strategic with my placement to minimize fast travel costs.
---
The 1/1000 of a chance to drop was most likely on purpose. These crybabies just want everything handed to them on a platter, while true fans of MMOs  understand that there has be scarcity especially when trading exists in a game. The game is not going to be ruined if you don't collect every cosmetic. Personally I could care less about the masks, they don't fit the aesthetic my characters go towards, so if I did get one of the ultra rares, I would just auction it off.
---
Easiest place I've found in the Enclave bunker is to the left of the Brig.  There are 3 MODUS terminals, the Brig on the right and 4 rows of desks to the left.  Look in the desks.  You can usually find 3 or 4 technical data.  Pick up one, drop it off, and repeat until you've used them all. 
---
Had someone run by my Rest Stop. They gave themselves a tour of the building, throwing up heart reacts at everything, especially my neon letter sign that pets people know everything is for public use. Made my day.
---
Then they ran down the street, where my friend's camp was. She made a freaking CASTLE. I can only imagine how they reacted to that lol
---
You can lock your doors though? They'll get wanted for picking the lock and then you have recourse...
---
Yeah, I do feel bad for the guy. Poor thing isn't even worth the bullets being one star an all. 
---
i did the parade twice yesterday i got the witch mask..and then the next time i was basically the robots bodyguard i just stood near all of them and all i got were garland plans!!! What the heck lol
---
Yep, each time I have been there there have always been those really high leveled ones, I first went there when I was level 57, then when I was 67, 72 and finally last week when I was 81. Each time it was the same. 
---
No it isn't.  I don't have time as a player to grind multiple characters and some of my friends don't want to even touch survival mode.   I wouldn't say this is an uncommon scenario either.  
---
I've had it a bit more, but more so in areas with lots of players (Ie. Fasnacht Festival).
---
You'll want the Speed Demon mutation to boost the reload speed. There are no reload speed perks that affect black powder guns (does Scattershot apply to blunderbusses?), but Quick Hands might work.
---
Other than that, just get rifle-related perks, and your holy grail will be three star legendaries with faster reload.
---
I disagree. Go grind adventure mode if you ain‚Äôt ready for survival. Survival ain‚Äôt for the weak. You shouldn‚Äôt be in there if you ain‚Äôt ready to fight. 
---
If you have bloody mess hit em till he pops and you'll be about to loot
---
You have an open area mic, you can't control it but you can try communicating if you have a desire. There's also the random spawn factor which determines which protectron even spawn which likely has an effect
---
Is there a list of all Overseer's holos that are confirmed out there?
---
Maybe.  But they were dead, CAMP didn't have significant damage, and they were dead laying on the roof.  I have also seen a Scorchbeast disengage and fly away after taking significant damage from my 3 turrets.  So not too worried about someone trying to train some SBs to my CAMP.  The turrets and the spotlights for additional targeting seem to handle themselves well.
---
On the off chance you still have it, the owl is the only one I‚Äôm missing and honestly the only good looking one in the set.  GT is BenevolentDM but I won‚Äôt be on til tonight 
---
Have they fixed the window glitch?
---
I have no issue with it being so rare. Start building a cosmetic trade market. 
---
Keep both and mess with equipping and in equipping them. You‚Äôll lose your head, literally 
---
It's been fine for a long time. 
---
Cool i misunderstood that part of it. I will be hunting those people. Although there will always be folks glitched inside a mountain trolling the survived longest ladder.
---
Id still like to know the server populations. Maybe even a list of players in the server in the social tab. I would play survival mode differently based on how active a server is. 
---
I'm 42 and play with three guys I met on here that are each in their 60s. They are my most favorite people to play with on here by far. 
---
Are you taking workshops? That enables PVP for you even if you are in passive mode.
---
It's been tested, there is a set limit on the amount of damage in terms of DPS that can be done to a person. Even something like an explosive two-shot minigun can only do so much damage over time, so you can't just cheese it with rapid damage.
---
If you are being one shot, you are doing something to enable pvp. Either hitting someone back, or more likely, taking a workshop.
---
They did that purposely and in kindness to those whose are working behind firewalls.
---
thats from a time when game developers love pauldrons cause shoulders were hard to animate. 
---
I can assure you I am getting laid in college 
---
 Here's what you do. Get at least 2 and run both of em'. Shoot one, switch to the other, shoot it and run away and reload. Some people run more. The Pistol run and gun works so well. for so many mid level situations.
---
Or they are just part of the playing majority who don't frequent this sub, and aren't concerned with data mining and drop rates.
---
Someone at Bethesda probably thinks it‚Äôs clever and fun to make us all far the event for 7 days and only one or two actual masks to ever exist.
---
Probably the same one that decides to put up a power armor paint for a couple days then remove it.  
---
I would love to know how. Because a scorchbeast encounter at any of the camps I have built means mass destruction to the camp. Are you in a lower level area? 
---
I guess no one remembers at all when Ultima Online did something very similar to this way back in the day, with the Red/Blue Moongates.
---
Just like back then, you had all of the Pro PvP people complaining about care bears and how they "ruined the game".
---
Get over it dude, you and everyone else. Nothing is that OP, there is a counter to everything, this is what makes it an RPG. 
---
There are people that play 20 hours a day, everyday. Wiping everyone‚Äôs progress that they‚Äôve worked for won‚Äôt fix anything. Those people playing all the time will still have all the good stuff. 
---
\*Checks for post by 900 Hour Man\*
---
Totally forgot blunderbuss was a thing but will keep the mutation in mind thanks 
---
Yeah .. I am so on the fence regarding PVE and  PVP .. it looks like I will be having a PVP toon , and a PVE toon .. so If I want the excitement I will switch toons.  But THANKYOU for letting me choose Bethesda .. Thats All I wanted.  
---
And always level 35, I usually let the lowbies kill him.
---
Yeeeees, I'll join. Lvl 163. GT: Sic Pyromaniac
---
confirmed.
---
Pacifists should definitely be allowed to own a workshop - in adventure mode. If pvpers don't want xp bc of bounty, then makes bounties 10x on adventure servers, and -10x on survival servers.
---
Damn! What a good idea. Now will have to do the quest a few more times today for the pic. 
---
That's my thoughts on it as well. Was super pumped to hear about the mode being launched only to dismiss it after hearing any character can jump in. If they ever offer it up with fresh and new characters I would gladly jump back into the game.
---
It hasn't even come out yet and people are bitching about this already. Why don't you guys wait to see if it actually a shit decision before pissing and moaning.
---
Yes please and nerf fast travel while you are at it. ;)
---
yea... a lot of people here just whine so damn hard the second something is really hard to get. Handmade rifle plans was the first thing. It's like if it's actually really hard to get something it's "unacceptable" to them and the game is broken... Like damn ya'll ever heard of Party Hats or Haloween Masks (Runescape) ? They must've never played Pokemon either because that shiny rate is a a lot more rare than 1/1000.
---
Well that sucks for me lol. I was all excited
---
Can't say I know what that is. Maybe I don't want to know :-D
---
No problem, good luck.
---
Reddit is the minority.  
---
People do not have time to regrind gear and not everyone has friends who even want to go into Survival at all, so it is good that we can switch freely. 
---
C'mon, if you are stupid and make yourself hostile or go into versus zone and then getting ganked. That's on your own stupidity...Wait, that is not even "getting ganked", that just PVP. Getting ganked means you aren't expecting enemy, but what kind of idiot don't expect enemy when he is hostile or in versus zone. 
---
i am going to print and frame this as the most random reply i have ever received
---
Point pleasant you non West Virginian peasant. 
---
Don't worry about adrenaline... what's the point of the adamantium skelleton? 
---
Pretty sure that you *don't* show up on the map unless you're wanted or up there in the leaderboards. 
---
Finally they will fix the Slap dmg for those who dont want pvp.
---
I am. Seems most people I find to play on Fo76 are all younger than me.
---
On PC people never use their mics. It's not reliable at all. The random spawn factor is pretty much accounted for in OP's stats, so either it's a miserable random chance or it's dependent on other players' actions which you can't control.
---
No argument there.  Bethesda encourages this behavior by setting unreasonable reward probabilities. 
---
it really does need to be changed, contesting the workshop should stay in/around the workshop area, it is NOT "contesting the workshop" to go hunting down the person across the map who doesn't give two shits that you took it from them
---
The decision to allow characters to transfer between modes is so short sighted. To please a handful of players who didn't want to start fresh they have put so called 'survival mode' at risk of been dead before it even gains traction. Nobodies characters are bound so nobody will feel committed. Both modes are essentially the same game except one you can get rekt over and over in.... Now which mode are you going to farm / quest in?
---
No, they usually have some kind of skirt around their hip.
---
Hope so! 
---
We need an "On this server" tab on the social menu then. Recents is full of bad data from past servers
---
Harder to get then Golden Pan it seems
---
yes, the problem is fixed because the griefer can't damage/kill you. not sure why that's hard for you to understand.  it's an improvement and a good one at that. griefers will grief, there's no way around it but now they're limited to just being annoying.   the ultimate problem of griefers still exsists, but this method of greifing is gone now.  kinda like people who complain all the  time even when something good happens.  Giving them more good thing doesn't seem to satisfy them, they'll find something else to complain about. 
---
I think PVP and normals mode characters should be separate, with no transfer between the two. (Though Flatwoods might be a shitshow in that case)
---
Only thing I notice is first minute after loadings. After last patch it went back to the old behavior. They had patched it 
---
why not just open the door for the people ... for free ?
---
Yeah, I have seen plenty of people actually flat out ganked for joining a team that was full of people who didn't understand that if someone had a workshop and it was contested the person could fast travel to the team and gank them all.
---
It isn't just stupidity, it is ignorance of game mechanics.
---
And it‚Äôs for a PvP Build btw. So I‚Äôm not sure adrenaline reaction fits in
---
yeah , I find it odd they are NOT making you start over - The whole duping situation is exactly why they should - Everyone should start on a leveled playing field. Those that duped and got away with it and those that have bought duped Items are 10 steps ahead of other players. 
---
Balance it out .. Start over- 
---
That mayor for a day quest is brutal at the end, make sure you‚Äôve got a troubleshooters armor piece or 2.
---
YAY! Congrats!!! Being a Dad is the best -- definitely find me in Appalachia if you want to hang!
---
At least can we nerf ( a little bit ) legendary effects so we don't split the playerbase ?
---
Definitely worth remembering to strike that thumbs up pose and snap a pick or three. The sloth is tall enough that you can completely fit under it for the pic.
---
Yup me too
---
yeah i appreciate it, i am at work and cant actually view the posts they make, its nice when people re-post the text here
---
This.
---
I‚Äôm down for pvp but only if you guys get rid of the bullshit one shot kills and other bs when people are starving/radiated/etc. It makes the pvp 100% pointless
---
K 
---
i will be tagging your workshop, then the game let's me destroy your CAMP... Thats the play. 
---
No crying on reddit about it. 
---
The separation of PVP and PVE (with PVP having these harsher rules) should have been there on release. 
---
got anything to back that up?
---
No. Drop rate for rare masks is .00000001% for the first time you run the event, and .00000001% on the last event you run. 
---
This crap is why duping were so prevalent in the first place
---
There is battlefield. No vats. No legendaries. Have fun.
---
Legendary power armor would make legendary regular armor obsolete, so that‚Äôs probably why they didn‚Äôt include it. 
---
Haha just don't be surprised if someone is in your locked house and not wanted.
---
Sent ya a Inv.
---
&gt;Event isn't over yet so we can't accurately even figure the drop rate. Some people forgot what the term "rare" actually means.
---
The problem is once it's over there's no knowing when it's going to be back. Is it once a year? Every few months? If some people really want a particular mask they're out of luck if it doesn't drop during the event, thus people are more vocal because they don't want to potentially have to wait a year for something that may or may not be dropping now.
---
Is it worth putting in the effort now? Is it a hopeless cause to keep grinding for them? The lack of answers leads to frustration. If it's just rare, that's fine. Rare is rare. But Bethesda's not got the best record with bugs so people have to speculate if it's *ultra rare* or just not dropping.
---
How old are you? Your behavior and logic is... immature.
---
\* Insert Tychus gif \*
---
Hell, it's about time!
---
I said they have none.
---
Thank you for this üòÅ
---
Im 29 plus a whole lot. 
---
I‚Äôd accept that if all temporary buffs were cleared and if that were explicit but many temporary buffs survive death or changing servers and punishing you for joining friends on another server is counterproductive to a multiplayer game.
---
Sounds like a list of Robot Masters from Mega Man.
---
I did the event on the first day it came out and at the end of it, there was a couple high level guys that dropped a bunch of stuff. Im really enjoying FO76
---
Also gta
---
That is probably it. On the Eastside you could max out turrets and they will just roast your camp. Missile turrets just pop unless you are there to mitigate.
---
You can buy the moon mask already.
---
Exactly what I'm doing. Keeping my current character for PvE, starting a new one to roleplay as a raider for PvP
---
But I have a feeling you don‚Äôt actually want to know how it can be done only claim it can‚Äôt be without thinking it thru, that‚Äôs disingenuous. 
---
i do understand, but also i can see the other side, other people may think the game is broken if people can be totally invisible all the time with no way to locate them
---
stealth is very powerful in this game with the damage boosts it gives, so there has to be a counter i suppose
---
im sure not everyone you PVP has a full supply of berry mentats all the time, so you will have to adjust your strats if you realize the player youa re dueling with can see you in stealth
---
I carry a .50 cal as my "primary" weapon, along with an LMG as a sidearm of sorts. "Stabilized" perk with PA is almost a must. Bear Arms and Bandoleer are also a great pairing, with Bear Arms reducing Heavy Weapon weights, and Bandoleer reducing weight of ballistic ammo. 
---
If you practice good fire control, you can be pretty damn accurate at long distances, and regularly nail headshots.
---
Carrying 4k+ rounds of .50 cal is almost the norm for me. Ammosmith + Super Duper, both maxed out, is a godsend for keeping those heavy weapons well-fed. I'll also echo the importance of Weapon Artisan, getting those heavy weapons repaired to 200%. If you also run with Gunsmith 5, you can tear through multiple SBQ/SB engagements without completely destroying your weapon.
---
Hey I was really happy to read you. I drew quickly how to achieve this.  
---
It basically boils down to placing your foundation tiles perfectly on the base of one of the bridge's pillars. I'm using the rail bridge next to the spawn point of Harper's Ferry for this example, where I built my camp.
---
1. You'll notice three "thicker" portions in the cobblestone pillars. You can make the foundations clip into these portions, but not in the recessed part, which seems to be made of solid geometry. You also need to have the three foundation tiles aligned perfectly in the center of the pillar base, like so:  
---
[https://imgur.com/8h9eTTK](https://imgur.com/8h9eTTK)
---
2. To have your C.A.M.P. walls snap perfectly under the bridge, the part of the foundation that must sink in the floor should be only the "pillars" part of the wooden foundation, leaving only the wood "box" visible. See this side view:  
---
[https://imgur.com/yrfpinI](https://imgur.com/yrfpinI)
---
When you are done with those two steps (you may need a few retries), the fun part begins. I stacked two staircase structures on the foundations (using the pillar glitch to stack them on top of each other), and afterwards you can start laying your upper floor structure (to remain under the bridge, stick to a width of three floor pieces). 
---
 You'll be able to stack a wall + a half wall on these upper floor tiles, and you can even build an attic in the top half wall, since the collision with the bridge roof is a bit higher. That's where I put the bed and my stash box!
---
If you try it out, make sure you give me a reply, curious to see out it turns out for ya :)  
---
These snowflakes. You know how many YEARS I had to grind Diablo II for my etharial self replenishing titans revenge. Or how many soft resets for my shiny rayquaza. RPGs with randomly generated loot are not supposed to give out god tier loot to everyone all the time, if ever. The dupes have made some of the top tier items in this game too common place as it is. "Oh no, the mask I want won't drop and I can't buy it on Amazon." QQ. Let them cry. If that kind of thing bothers you, just stop playing, plug in you old N64 and go back to Pokemon snap. To the rest of the real gear hunters, GL HF.
---
Amateur ... real trolls just nuke the place.
---
The quick fix seems underwhelming if my understanding of Addictions is correct.
---
Just did my 6th run.  After I ran it 4 bags appeared on the ground full of witch and soldier masks. Guess people are tired of getting those two. 
---
And these people can still do PVE on Survival mode. But while PVP players want still do PVE, PVE players have no desire in PVP. That's the core of all these PVP/PVE discussions. It's not symmetrical. PVP players want either only PVP or both PVP and PVE. While PVE players want mostly only PVE.
---
Berry mentats.
---
A cooldown period for switching game modes would be ideal.  You want to give people a chance to switch if they accidentally selected the wrong one, but if you've been playing "Survival" for a couple of hours, you'd have to wait to switch back to "Adventure".  (Say, reset the cooldown period with nuke codes.)
---
&gt;Because you can swap back and forth, nobody is going to quest or level in this mode. People will only join it to troll and PVP. There's nothing survival about it, it's basically deathmatch mode.
---
I disagree. I think the 20% experience boost is definitely incentive to play.
---
I'm level 107 and have been sneaky sniper the whole way.  I've gone through a progression of weapons.  Early on I used the hunting rifle, primarily because I found a ton and learned a bunch of mods.  I usually prefer the mods to reduce recoil (stable barrel/stock, suppressor, and recon scope is a must).  I started with the piercing mag for the extra bullet.
---
Then at some point I saw a vendor (top of world I think) with .50 cal refined.  I bought that immediately and that was a huge boon.  Crafting ammo in batches of 100 (and later 180 with ammosmith) meant I really never ran out of ammo.
---
For mutations, I didn't really mess around with them until I randomly got speed demon, and then I become hooked.  The extra reload speed was SUPER helpful.  Later on I added marsupial, which is also a key for me to jump on building s and hide when sniping fails and the S\*\*\* hits the fan.
---
The next iteration for my build was that I found an instigating hunting rifle at a vendor.....another's man junk is my treasure!  Double damage on first hit is a perfect fit.
---
My current experiment is that I've switched my hunting rifle to the .308 hair trigger receiver.  I was worried that the lower damage output would make it so I can't 1-shot things, but so far it's still getting the job done.  Need to try wes tek because the mobs of level 68 super mutants in a closed space was a big problem the first time I did it. Also need to see how this current combo works in a silo.  The hair trigger + speed demon makes my hunting rifle feel almost as fast as lever, and I think the full reload is faster than lever (no science here just my impressions).
---
I've also recently added Gun Fu (max) and rank 2 adrenaline.  Both seem to work well together.  Sneaking through whitesprings and headshotting most everything works as long as VATS doesn't do the 'miss five times in a row' thing.
---
I've also been switching my mags to anything armor piercing.
---
I have a 3\* lever that is executioner+limb damage and forget the other.  I can play with either but the lever sometimes takes a couple shots, which is not a problem because of faster fire rate.
---
For my support weapon I switch to a handmade, or just run and jump on a building and hide.
---
I think the next thing I want to work on is action point refresh.  The main problem I run into now is that I drain my action points and if I'm in a mob of whitesprings ghouls, I can get mushed pretty fast.
---
I won't be there. And pacifist mode will not be removed ever if any unique (? more powerful) weapons that may drop in survival can be brought back to adventure mode.
---
Call me weak all you like, PvP doesn't do it for me so I don't do it. 
---
üòÅ
---
It says on it decreases hunger and thirst 
---
Yeah, why would I ever trust level 28 turrets against a level 80 mob?  
---
Well, to be clear I wasn't even contemplating the thought that you "implied" it was a stupid question. Sorry if it came of that way. It's true though. There are a lot of dumb questions regarding games that have surprisingly not obvious or really bogus answers. There are a ton of things that are just assumed and then never actually explored or looked into.
---
Hmm, there could be some kind of glitch with it. I just know that in my own experience I've had many people try to attack me and I just never fight back and have never taken damage enough to worry about it. Usually I switch over to camera mode and strike a pose until they get tired of smacking me and going nowhere.
---
ill be one tonight UK time if its late US time then alpha will be best place. either way just let me know
---
That‚Äôs just an assumption. I‚Äôm a glitch ridden game like this it‚Äôs more reasonable to assume that they fucked up the drop rates rather than just leave the other masks for the second half. Especially when there is no official‚Äúsecond half‚Äù of the event.
---
They can still damage and kill you if the circumstances are right, there are plenty of ways. Worse than that though is that you cannot damage them, this change actually takes away a method of dealing with certain problems that players had in their toolbox before.
---
I just wanted a nice survival game in the wastelands with some skills, but I see, at least I tried, have fun in camping fest
---
omg bro that rant you deleted about PvE players needing to be civil. Hahahaha, the poor Raider wants people to be nice? That is hilarious. I thought you were a Raider, toughen up. A Raider would expect the people they're torturing, hounding, stalking, (following to different servers) to call them stuff.  Raiders aren't going to cry when people call them names, you're RAIDERS. But no, you're going to cry about it, and report people for being uncivil, you're not a Raider. You're just a power tripper.
---
So, wait, y'all are upset that rare drops are rare?
---
I was actually asking the person who was saying they use a 50 cal and crafting all that ammo would have been impossible. I wanted to see how many hours they played a day because some people only play a couple hours and can‚Äôt understand the grinding some people do if only because it‚Äôs fun to have a goal and accomplish it.
---
Sometimes I‚Äôll buy 200 stable flux from a trader and make it my goal that week to convert it into ultracite ammo, I guess I‚Äôve exhausted all the questlines and just want something to fill my time that I deem productive. A lot of people won‚Äôt understand this, or even attempt to.
---
Turrets scaling to the zone is something I want so bad
---
Rolling characters over with duped assassins sentinel/cav armor and bloodied god rolls is a terrible idea. I would like to see a survival mode where people have to get by on the real world shit legendary rolls they can scrounge up from level one. Now that would be fun.
---
I'm an old fart but on PC üòí
---
Pretty sure that guy was just making a joke. Click on the link
---
You say its "bitching". Its people being concerned about the update. How BGS are proposing that people can transfer items over is what I'm more concered with people can go around Bloodied builds 1 shotting whomever they so desired. 
---
....so? Like, I don't get why people are upset about this. Do you feel like you deserve to get a rare drop, or something?
---
All I'm seeing here is more speculation. This patch made server stability garbage. They aren't telling us anything. Unless you have some secret communication from Bethesda, you also have no idea what is going on. None of us do.
---
Want to know another way a game dies? Banning its fucking players when the player base is already tiny on your most publicly ridiculed and most embarrassing game release in recent history. Bethesda has fucked up almost on a weekly basis in some way. It has been almost non-stop since release. This is just another in the long line of fuck ups.
---
All I fucking want is for them to actually tell us what the fuck is going on. It's incredibly frustrating being in the dark when they can seemingly flip a switch and we lose access. Regardless of if you cheated or not (I DID NOT FUCKING CHEAT), we are still human fucking beings and deserve at least some kind of basic courtesy. 
---
Stop giving Bethesda credit. They are a shambles.
---
I don't understand how you can think that 6k is enough of a result to get any information from. You can't determine anything from such a small number of runs. 
---
Wait, a power armor paint got removed? Or are you talking about atom shop paints?
---
I did an event yesterday where all the enemies were level 68. It was nice, as a level 15, to be able hit some of the enemies and gain some experience. Panicked when a lvl 68 creepy looking toad started hopping towards me though! 
---
I'm on PC. 
---
I have around 89 pieces technical data in my stash. That will be nice once I do the BoS quest.
---
Alright, cool. I'll pm you my gamertag and I'll see you at 8 my time/10 your time
---
Seriously no one wants to regrind for gear and anyone who puts a ton of time into survival is going to have a field day hunting noobs. Then you'll be whining because you keep getting 1 shotted and you're only level 5 and can't level up because of this.
---
The one-shot meta is a real problem.  It will be tricky to find the balance between the forgiving PvE setup and the "realistic" damage of current PvP.
---
thank god you can transfer characters or I wouldn't even consider playing it and having to suffer through the awful RNG system to try and get stuff I want
---
I think it has a lot to do with the event only being on for a week, and the realistic odds of even a high-hours player of ever getting a ‚Äòrare‚Äô mask after repeating the quest all week are still looking a little too close to 0. 
---
It‚Äôs another MMO-style event attempt with the wrong mechanics. 
---
With extremely low % chances (as this seems to be), the only ‚Äòfair‚Äô way of allowing people the chance is to leave the content open permanently (possibly with weekly/monthly lockouts - a la daily quests) or make it very clear that the event is seasonal and will be coming back. 
---
Look at mounts in WoW raids vs Seasonal ‚Äòevent‚Äô mounts. Cosmetic rewards for repeated content. Raid mounts (unrelated to content achievements) have an incredibly low drop % from bosses you can kill once per week for loot. You get 1 roll a week, forever. That‚Äôs fair. The seasonal ‚Äòevent‚Äô mounts are usually obtainable for 1-2 weeks of the year. Their % drop from the events are usually a bit higher, and you can try once a day for 2 weeks with slightly higher odds, because they expect people to have to miss a day or two. 
---
Similar to event cosmetics on FO76 as they are now. Extremely rare, but infinitely repeatable so they‚Äôll turn up eventually. With this, it‚Äôs seasonal, so we‚Äôre on the clock running agains a random number generator that‚Äôs shooting at a target we can‚Äôt see. 
---
Personally, I don‚Äôt subscribe to this. As much as the masks are appealing (jester and goblin especially), if I get one, fantastic. If not, the event was fun anyways. It‚Äôd just be helpful to have a little clarity on how many of these masks Bethesda were expecting to release into the world over this week. 
---
Well see. Currently downloading the game via Bethesda launcher :). My rig is 4 years old now so I don't expect to run on ultra. Bought it for the witcher 3 back then.
---
Yes, please.  I can't believe how so few people have one. 
---
Then there's that guy that apparently can't speak into a mic without waking the entire house at night.
---
I'm hoping we'll be able to craft mods to sell directly to players, rather than having to trade the item to mod and then trade the item back.  Even with a completely trustworthy person, server issues could cause an issue with trading the item back and simply trading the mod is one transaction versus a few steps.
---
I literally feel flattered that you are thinking of me. I do not know you in the slightest, yet you make a post awaiting my response. Thank you! I feel very unwanted in life and I needed this!
---
Yeah I waited too but nothing happened, so I took a photo and left.
---
Biggest disagree.
---
The RNG system is terrible. Without addressing that, way to force your players into a wipe into the *absolute* worst RNG system possible.
---
Suck it up.
---
It causes harassment during the Event. 
---
6k is the data set we got, and so far there is only 2 people with masks that we have seen. As more and more people do the survey i will update the post.
---
I want one I'm not on Xbox tho
---
I was thinking more of "this is the apocalypse. Why did you add girly rainbows?" Kinda like the people)e that com0Kained about fastnaught
---
Im just glad Im going to be done with PVP bullshit.  
---
You gotta shoot'em in the head!
---
How much TC did you have to use to get it? Also this game seven confirmed the day after the update.
---
Yep. I'm glad someone else sees the big picture. For this to be fun, you need all types of players - players who want to pvp, players who don't mind a bit of pvp but are mostly pve players (me), and pve players who are willing to take the risks for the increased rewards. As soon as someone gets ganked and loses caps / junk / aid items and realizes how much less efficient it is to play on survival mode, they're going to be back to pve server. It's also a huge disservice to those who want to play exclusively on pvp server. This is why WoW devs didn't allow pve characters to transfer to pvp. Getting to high level and good gear in wow on a PvP server was a lot more challenging, and it would be insulting to let pve players that had a much easier time earning gear and levels join the pvp server.
---
Force everyone to create a new character for survival mode so everyone is on equal footing from the start.
---
My build is based on VATS, so, i must not play PVP? or will have to respec my character in order to play this mode? 
---
But that's already how it'll be?
---
Put 300 or so hours in over a few characters. Even as someone who had time, I still wouldn't just on the off chance terrible RNG based progression wants to reward me a little (it doesn't)
---
I am not saying they have to reset everyone's stats, I'm saying they should allow people to transfer characters over, but NOT the weapons/armour, people would have learned to craft weapons and armour to survive.
---
Since no 1 player could ever be expected to do that many; it is a more than adequate sample size.
---
If 100 runs wont net you a single rare item, they are far beyond "rare".
---
No it isn't.  It lasts 250% longer than one at 1%.  It lasts 500% longer than one at 1% while using the Perk card.  
---
YALL BETTER GET READY FOR AN ASS KICKING CAUSE IM BRINGING MY TSE GAUSS AND FULL ASSASSINS GEAR INTO THIS SERVER BOOOOOIISSS LOOK FOR MY NAME AT THE TOP OF THE SCOREBOARDS
---
I think you are painting the PVE community with way to big a brush here. Most players will have dabbled in, or continue to dabble in both PVP and PVP content even unknowingly in adventure mode just like they have on the current server mode. 
---
How many PVE players do you think claim workshops? I have seen tons of people claiming workshops for PVE purposes woefully unprepared for PVP. Even if they don't want to fight they still dabble in the pvp content and that won't change with slap damage.
---
This would be amazing
---
Some factions were allied though.
---
Someone put all the bad ideas into one post! Great! Bethesda don't do any of this.
---
Jesus, I asked about drop rates, not about mask this or not. You can't be sure 1/16 is right drop rate
---
I totally agree on this.
---
There's supposed to be baggage claim tickets you can turn into the robot beneath pleasant valley ski resort. But they don't seem to drop.
---
Even if an item has a 1% chance of being obtained then, due to the inherent nature of randomness, you would need many more runs on average. As you get higher and higher you start to see it creep closer to the correct drop rate. 
---
While I agree that rare gear should be rare, I also really enjoyed Pokemon Snap as a child.  You've brought back nostalgia of that game and there's no way for  me to play it right now lol.
---
44, and most of my buddies are over 40 too.  Play g the series since the '90s.
---
It runs fine, but since I upgraded to OneX there was a noticeable difference 
---
His name start with Gaara?
---
All of these seem like poor examples and frankly decent game design. Losing 5 caps because you picked the wrong lock is a nothingburger. Watoga high school is a pvp specific event area that warns you, and you can farm plastic at Morgantown any ways. No shit if you have pacifist off they can attack back? I feel like you're really picking at straws to push a narrative.
---
Some people have no life and will grind for 10-20hrs a day in survival. Others have no problem buying gear off ebay for real world money. You're putting yourself at a major disadvantage against them with this idea.
---
Or at least give us the option to play on a a new character exclusive server. 
---
Yeah, once I realized that, I don't really bother with it either. There's nothing it can drop that is useful for me.
---
In fact, I tend to do a lot of nothing during Fasnacht.
---
;))
---
Yeah, but I'm okay with that.  After the turret recalc values I had enough budge to massively increase my CAMP, added a lot of crops and Bessie, and added an extra missile turret and 3 more spotlight turrets.  It's fine.
---
What basis do we have to believe that some mechanic of the event or the drop rate will change in the coming days? Is there any precedent for anything like that anywhere else in the game?
---
Love it!   Looking forward to PVE-centric servers. 
---
Yes.  Atom shop stuff.  Sorry, should have been clearer.  
---
Basically all the stuff in the atom shop that is ‚Äúlimited time‚Äù exists to exploit what is basically a ‚Äúgacha‚Äù system.   While normally you could invest time in playing the game to earn the points and get the stuff, by forcing time limits on things they push people toward buying points now instead of waiting to earn them thru playing.
---
I'm not seeing any problems, I even have weak computer.
---
I don't like ever spawn at camp because there's SB spawn right next to it though.
---
It is nice you see in future. Can you tell me, will trump win next selections?
---
Is there a list of discord servers open for people still playing 76?  I was part of a few with friends, but all have left and closed their servers down.  I‚Äôve been struggling to survive in the game since day 1, and would love to find a new server that‚Äôs still going...
---
Not if you bring your own preexisting toon
---
Welp, looks like that's it for me then. When will bethesda learn that they can't be great at every facet in this game? it's like they never really want to jump into anything. Is this a great looter game? Is it a game with a quality story? Can you interact with the world and the players within it? The answer to all of those is "kind of, not really". Deciding to take the middle road once again in regards to a pvp mode just shows that they really don't have a clue what it is they are trying to do here. This PVP mode isn't good for anyone. PVP players and PVE players will just see this as the half measure it is. For me and my friend group, allowing characters to switch between PVE and PVP is a deal breaker. No way should I and my group be punished for not using duping, exp exploits, and essentially waiting for the game to get to a playable state. 
---
  What this game needed, after all this time and the shitshow that has lead to this point, was a fresh start. I had been keeping up with this game via the subreddit, and keeping it downloaded on my playstation because I believed that bethesda would turn it around, possibly go in a new direction due to the obvious backlash and dislike for core game mechanics... It seems that they are determined to take this car off the cliff and to me, and my friend group, that just doesn't work. I hope they can get an idea of what game they want this to be, because this jack of all trades shit isn't working.
---
Oh right, that's the Fever Blossom. 
---
It doesnt spoil and it weighs almost nothing.
---
2 frog eggs (radtoad wont work), oil, 3 milk, and razorgrain flour (which takes razorgrain and concrete to make)
---
So give the owner a 'surrender workshop?' prompt when someone tried to claim one, instead of the highly abusable system we have now.
---
From what I've seen if you have a bladed weapon you can chop up his standing body and he'll gib into smaller, more lootable chunks.
---
I'm not really hating on Pokemon snap. Lord knows I FCd that game. 
---
So, a more Toxic way to play? nice
---
\&gt;   this change actually takes away a method of dealing with certain problems that players had in their toolbox before. 
---
How so? In today's environment, if someone is training a mob of ghouls toward you or shooting cars to make them explode when you are near and you attack them you deal slap damage and open yourself up to PvP which is what they ultimately want.  In the new environment, it will be the same thing.  The difference is that another player can't patiently kill you via slap damage or force you to use all your stimpacks as they continuously shoot you.
---
What is the "method of dealing with certain problems" that exists now that the removal of slap damage will nullify?
---
this is the best reply!!!
---
Aren't Goblines high born goblins?
---
Well first off you don‚Äôt know the nature of what the challenges are gonna be in this new mode. I am assuming that even a bird brained dev will create daily or weekly ‚Äúsurvival challenges‚Äù that will force players to all go to specific place at a certain time to do a certain thing hence upping the chance of people seeing each other. Hence what the article says about‚Äùrisk‚Äù.  There‚Äôs no chance someone who holes up in a shack is gonna have an advantage 
---
It was "between 0 and 1 is &gt;= 1" which is an infinitely small chance but those numbers are all just placeholder data. 
---
I would prefer they actually balance the game rather than restrict what my one character can do. 
---
so you're actually thinking that the drop rates are correct, we're just entitled for thinking they should be higher?
---
I don't agree. 
---
You will always have "OP" ALWAYS... and you can only start with a level playing field once. 
---
Not only that, this has been done successfully before. The one I experienced myself was Ultima Online with Felucca (PvP) and Trammel (PvE)... I'm sure it's been done in other games this way as well. 
---
I prefer PvE, so Survival mode will not be my "home", I have no desire to create a brand new character there "to start on a level playing field"... What I will go there for is the weekly challenges and legendary gear... but ONLY if I can bring it back home to Adventure mode with me. 
---
The point is they all flag you for pvp and most people getting ganked right now are not being ganked through slap damage but a method similar to these examples.
---
I have seen way too many  "I was one shot through slap damage" type posts since launch. People just don't understand the mechanics and this change isn't going to fix that.
---
I ahve to agree, a fresh start in survival means more tense situations, more challenge, and more equal footing
---
allowing level 350's in with full sets of armor seems counter-productive
---
Yeah you can join the event like 10 minutes later when it starts, and be fine.
---
Absolutely!  They need to be balanced better for the PvP side of things.  
---
This is what we need to be asking for I believe. 
---
How many more fights are you gonna do? I want to see if i can make it to one
---
Bethesda, please allow the transfer of characters between worlds so that trade is not restricted.  
---
Roflol "real gear hunters."
---
That's almost as funny as calling a silly cosmetic mask "god-tier loot."
---
&gt; Maybe something changes in the next few days? 
---
Cute that you think something would change that fast.   We have a few months of experience with the speed at which Bethesda responds to things.
---
Love it!
---
&gt;2- Also, I'm collecting armor sets, and I've noticed I seem to have matching mutant, scorched and ghoul armor sets with few to no overlap. Meaning I mysteriously have torso, L arm, R arm, L leg, R leg, with few to no duplicates. If it were purely random, I'd get multiples before I completed the set.
---
There is more combinations for armor than I can remember unless it's a 1‚òÜpiece you won't get duplicates maybe 2‚òÜ but even that's unlikely.
---
From what I understand with legendaries the game RNGs the weapon or armor. Then rolls the primary effect, secondary and third effects if applicable.
---
57. I play on Xbox 
---
Or maybe this could be a way to get all the one-shotters out of standard play. 
---
Also, crazy idea, what if everything in survival can kill you?
---
I did, and his words and the image lead me to believe he thinks it is just fine...
---
... and the new player who joins FO76 in a month will be in the exact scenario you offer as a complaint.
---
That‚Äôs what it already is now 
---
Either way the system can have problems honestly. I think the best solution would be not using preexisting characters, but do some sort of matchmaking to keep low lvls from getting rekt
---
that is exactly what i am saying....?
---
I think that this sample size is plenty.  I‚Äôm not aware of any reports still of anyone legitimately getting one at all.  This is only a week long event.
---
I want rare things to exist in this game, but come on...
---
they cannot kill you by slap damage. that is what was fixed. 
---
Bethesda can't really do anything about the ingenuity and resilience of griefers.  complainers will find the dumbest shit to complain about.   
---
The 300s are the pve players that just like to grind. It's the level 60-80s that don't wear power armor you should be worried about. Those are the full assn/sents with 1 shot bloody explosive builds.
---
the .50 cal has no mods, wish it did tho
---
No I think it's because they wanted them to drop later stage.
---
Knight, SGT, and CPT are what I've gotten. I've seen people talk about paladin and officer paints too. 
---
Please continue to allow free transfer, Bethesda.  
---
&gt;You know how many YEARS I had to grind Diablo II for my etharial self replenishing titans revenge
---
And if you had the same rarity but only 7 days to do it in, after which never able to get them...
---
Not really.
---
If you're a high level sniper like me I usually hit the suiciders from the rooftops as the spawn, nothing useful for the low levels and they pose the most threat to the robots.
---
I drew the connection due to the rarity of the items, not necessarily their usefulness 
---
What makes you think that the drops rates shouldn't be what they are? 
---
Please provide some logical reason they are wrong. And I say logical, not emotional. Emotional reasons are, because I want one or people shouldn't have to keep doing the same event over and over. 
---
Updooted.
---
They definitely spawn at night in the same place they spawn during that quest. Just unlucky. Also, may need to hop servers a few times.
---
Just wait a while and it should turn onto a meat pile. Then you can loot it. 
---
46 xbox here. 
---
Im in a FB group for FO and Skyrim podcast, seems most members are 40+.
---
Im 54 and loving the crap out of this game! :)
---
40 and i play with my wife. 
---
Statistically a sample size of 6k is way too small to be able to determine anything. If it is less than a 1% chance then all depending on how the rng falls we could have 0 drops or we could have a could hundred or anywhere in between. 
---
I'll just jump server the second you tag my workshop.
---
Nice, I like it. 
---
Only heavy barrel and prime
---
Make sure you block them so they can't get on a server you're on again unless they actually know someone on that server.  If everyone does this eventually they'll have no one to play with!
---
I almost consider that a bug to be honest. Really shouldn't flag you outside of the workshop. That's the whole point of the workshop boundary I thought - step inside to claim it / contest it, but you can get killed. If you don't want to die, let the other person have it. Just doesn't make sense that you're flagged everywhere if it's contested.
---
Couldn‚Äôt I do the hard parts of the quests on Adventure mode then switch to Survival to finish it for that bonus xp? Seems too exploitable. 
---
I'd really like to be able to play both modes on the same character depending on my mood... I don't see the big deal... Don't want to go into survival mode as a low level? Level up in Adventure mode first... 
---
So a griefer isn't really after pvp. They are looking to get a rise out of you. Some of them employ pvp, but you can overcome them in the current system with skill/gear/numbers on pvp where this change makes them totally still able to grief other players by other means while making them invincible to pvp.
---
Does that make sense?
---
me too! it should be fun and tense and maddening all at the same time!
---
Thanks , wasn‚Äôt sure. That sux . You guys kno what perks that world work best with it? Im heavy melee but would like something for fighting the SBQ in flight. 
---
Get hit with a full drum of Handmade from a player that has level 3 Tank Killer and Tormentor.
---
Or One Gun Army Minigun user,  or Enforcer from a shotgun user. Stimpacks won't heal your limbs fast enough. 
---
My man, i pick up legendarys out of my stash i fast travel to somewhere and then my screen gets invaded
---
Ultrazit? Sourgebeast? 
---
Would I be going out on a limb if I guessed you're playing the game in German? 
---
I really like the Blackpowder weapons, so I am focused on using them a lot. I would suggest getting Adrenal Reaction mutation(about 150 caps from players), and soak up rads until 20% health. Your end goal would be Bloodied Blackpowders. This will require dedication and caps to complete. Nerd Rage 3 card in Intelligence (lots of damage), all 3 Rifle Man cards in Perception at level 3, Radicool helps because you gain Strength making use of all those roads you have, Adrenaline 5 card in Agility (Bloodied Explosive Blackpowder Pistol comes in clutch here), Bloody Mess 3 in Luck. This is my card setup plus quality of life things, you may also want Gunsmith 5 in Intelligence for 50% durability, and Escape Artist in Agility with Sneak 3 (Sneaky sneaky x2 damage). Also, a huge point, you need unyielding armor to max out your special stats, it grants 3 to all specials except endurance at low health. Per piece equipped. That means my special stats look like this: 37 strength, 23 perception, 6 Endurance, 19 Charisma, 19 Intelligence, 27 Agility, and 22 Luck.
---
I hope you like my suggestions! Good hunting! 
---
Ive noticed in the first 30 seconds of rendering when I first load up is taking alot longer than it used to. But not once its loaded do I see it again
---
I just voted on that poll, across two characters i‚Äôve gotten
---
5 giant merman masks
---
4-6 soldier hats 
---
And no less than 3 of the others each.
---
I got a beret, and both recipes(doubles on the donuts) and most of the decorations though i bet that old man winter effigy is just as rare as the raremasks can anybody confirm? 
---
Well yeah the Atom shop clearly exists to earn them money. I'm just glad it isn't a loot box based system, and that the items are only cosmetic. Most of the limited time stuff hasn't really interested me, but that's personal taste.
---
I'm not saying V.A.T.S shouldn't be allowed in PvP because it seems to me to be a big part of what makes Fallout unique. 
---
I will say that, in my opinion, V.A.T.S takes the fun out of PvP for people who actually enjoy playing videogames. It takes all of the skill out of combat when the only controls needed are LB and RT (I use Xbox controller). Yes, there is still strategic planning for people who actually plan their own build, which I see some people completely steal builds from others so that is now a skill not needed.
---
V.A.T.S. is the reason I didn't enjoy 3. 
---
I don't do workshops because I don't want to deal with PvP. 
---
There should absolutely be an option to start new characters that are survival only and be matched with other players that are also survival only. 
---
Let current players toggle between both modes with other current players, but let there be a separate "hard core" mode for only new characters that are locked with other new characters in survival mode. 
---
There was a ton of highly up-voted ideas about this when survival was first discussed. There is so much potential for this to be awesome, but as it stands now if I haven't been farming and min/maxing my build for months, there is no real competition or excitement. 
---
Glad Bethesda is trying new things but I just can't get excited about this mode.
---
The difference is that these are likely guaranteed legendaries, rather than having to farm for them. They may not be as good as a TSE weapon, but if you don't have the time or patience to farm for once, this is a reasonable alternative.
---
Windows 7 here. Any other suggestion to do that? I didn't get his name because I was just trying to find a solution and let everyone else deal with his shenanigans. Others did report him.
---
What i meant when i said "level playing field" is to have it so people don't have legendary items which are like Two shot, Anti-Armour, etc. Like them having no legendary items being able to be spawned in these worlds so that people cant obtain legendaries. I'm saying like people have to use base weapons like Handmades, Assault rifles, lever actions, so people don't have the unfair advantage of legendary effects. Not anything about their levels. 
---
When I refind the post or find other confirmation, I‚Äôll edit this. Knew I should have sourced and saved that. 
---
Where I'm at I never get enemy spawns, so I wouldn't know. 
---
Disagree. I like that mechanic. Great way to farm caps n junk
---
Agree 110%
---
Drop shadows and reflection to low and decrease the render distances. I did that in order to run at 4k and its well worth it
---
Only if it's a Rainbow Ray Gun
---
He probably played beta sessions and used trap disarm XP glitch.
---
I don't have turrets, either. 
---
It's not even max level gear. But as stated many tines you can always loot the meat pile or bloody mess the corpse. I don't bother I get my event rewards and server hop for the next parade.
---
As soon as you start claiming it the owner os flagged to you no matter where they are.
---
I am prone to agree with you, but thats the game 
---
You know, don't think I've seen any since I added Bessie either.  
---
Heavy barrel and prime receiver are the only mods. Heavy barrel is good though, boosts damage
---
God rays gtfo its rainbow season biiitch
---
This sample size along with all available reports are enough for me to know that these things either aren‚Äôt dropping or at too small of a percentage.  This goes beyond rare.  I don‚Äôt know what else to say.
---
Anti vats during pvp + limited visibility for opponent.
---
Are the skull mask and toothy man mask two different things? 
---
As long as you don't have to collect intestines, a nuke is no big deal. Unless it drops during the actual parade and makes you leave the area. I've started collecting the intestines before the even starts so I'm ready in case that happens.
---
Not a bad idea.
---
It has heavy barrel and (queen drop) prime receiver 
---
Addictions totally cross server hops.
---
"painbow"
---
Ok fair enough. I'm not sure what you can do about players who won't learn mechanics though. Private servers I guess.
---
Sure, that could work, but it‚Äôd be difficult to get enemies to consistently spawn to attack the VIP in a way a scripted mission would do it (think The Messenger).
---
I‚Äôve helped some lower level players through quests as well but I think it‚Äôs a bit different since the guards aren‚Äôt rewarded (whereas with this they would be rewarded with loot scaled to the difficulty).  You also have to go out your way to set up something like this, whereas an actual event provides a basic framework so that all players need to do is participate.  Plus, self-made quests don‚Äôt give the quest giver any reward beyond the satisfaction of helping other players.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, in many situations that is a reward in itself (I spent a few hours giving a low levelled player a tour of Lucky Hole Mine and the Cranberry Bog and then escorted him to his camp between New Gad and The Whitespring), but this would provide tangible incentives for those who are otherwise not motivated enough to create their own quests.  There‚Äôs also that issue where not all lower level players appreciate high level players tag along, therefore making it hard to get the quest going consistently.  With an event, you are not only guaranteeing that everyone involved gets rewarded, you‚Äôre also guaranteeing that the VIP joins the event knowing that the whole point of the quest is to involve higher level players (or a whole bunch of similar levelled players).
---
Then I wouldn't have ever gotten it. I built a javzon for that item after I got it. It actually dropped on my necromancer that really had no end game relevance anyway. Why try to make an endgame shotgun build if you don't have a good shot gun. You work with what you get and adjust or transfer an item to a new character if it ever drops.  My point is that people shouldn't expect to get rare items. If everyone gets them, what makes them rare? 
---
I don't know. I was just focused on trying to finish the event and I let the others report him. Didn't get his name.
---
Is there a list of availible masks? And rewards?
---
There should just be a simple flag for new "hard core" characters that are newly created that are only matched with other "hard core" characters. 
---
Let players who have been playing switch freely between modes as it is planned now, but let others separate themselves from the player pool and play with others who have done the same. 
---
I wonder what was different about the one I did. The game put us in a team or something and I couldn't even target him with VATS. 
---
And you can't kill them either. So just like before you leave the server and block them. The solution is the same, no code changes required.
---
I remember in world of warcraft an exploit that let hunters tame a werewolf in his human form. Blizzard removed the exploit but let the people keep the pet if they had already tamed him. We need more of that, imo.
---
You mean they didn‚Äôt get this right the first time? I‚Äôm shocked.
---
Good idea! Wish I had gotten his name.
---
Well Done
---
This is a horrible reason for allowing the transfer of characters. So what if you would be fully geared in 3 days and taking out people? That is a normal PVP function for people who know and understand a game(and I speak as a person you would probably destroy). The current decision to allow character transfers essentially means that you face no real consequences for your actions in PVP, which personally kills any reason for me to participate to begin with. its like gambling with pebbles or bits of string. Sometimes the funnest part of PVP is risk and knowing there is a guy out there that can stomp me into the fucking ground - if they can find me. The place for keeping things even stevens and making everyone happy is in PVE, not in a mode that they are trying to use to breathe new life into a dying game.
---
I am 42, and my wife is 39.  Both regular players.  One of our friends who regularly groups with us is 50.
---
Those people were already going to dominate after a few days of grinding had the mode required a fresh start, this just saves us without the time or patience to play the game through again from having to build up another character. I would have preferred having separate inventories for both modes, but I'm not too bummed about it.
---
I have a friend who has the blue old man mask, on ps4.  Dropped the first day for him ...so they drop 
---
Sure sounds like a good plan to log in every day, not show up on the map, instant kill someone from stealth with a huge bounty, get double caps and XP, then log out and go back to adventure to lose your wanted status in a less punishing mode (then repeat over and over if you really want to or just do it once a day or whatever) 
---
I wouldn't say 20% more XP is pointless...
---
I didn't mean the specific effect didn't duplicate, I meant that If I have 2 legs and a torso, I get an arm... even though probablistically I am more likely to get another leg or torso.
---
It seems like the game is TRYING to give you matching sets.  It could be my good luck (or even my high SPECIAL luck of 9), but the pattern is so consistent it is weird.  I honestly have 4 armor sets with no duplicates.
---
Amazing
---
This is a very limited time event. Do you disagree?
---
There are 10 masks "available". Agreed?
---
Out of the thousands of people on this forum and myself and all the thousands of players more people have seen, there has been only a single case of 1 of these found and it's veracity can't be confirmed. Do you agree?
---
So we have a situation where a significant amount of time has passed in a limited time event and half of the rewards that are supposedly freely available haven't been given or even SEEN by more than a single person (and that's not verifiable).
---
Let's be clear, what's the more reasonable response in a situation like this:
---
1: "Huh, that's a little weird, I wonder if they messed up a decimal place in their rng generator, or the drops are bugged?"
---
2: "You guys are being entitled, the drop rate is what it is."
---
58 here...  I‚Äôm I the oldest?
---
it's crazy that no one sees this
---
You couldn't really change it to "double the length" because on some drinks it already affects the length.  It will double/triple SPECIAL bonuses, but if there's some weird bonus like on Tick Blood Tequila or Ballistic Bock, it just doubles/triples the length of the effect instead.
---
I haven't noticed server lag, and I'm on really bad internet. I've actually been thinking that things have been a lot better lately. 
---
And please don't add a chime when events start, or at least make it optional, it'd drive me nuts lol. 
---
It would be nice for higher level legendary enemies would show up. 
---
Then what's the incentive for anyone that doesn't normally play a PvP mode ... or even have any interest in it to go to Survival mode? 
---
This isn't about splitting the community for Bethesda... and it shouldn't be. 
---
People like me, PvE preferred.. will go to Survival mode if you give me a reason to... (ie: Legendary gear that I can bring back to my preferred world)... I'm not going to go there JUST to PvP... I've no interest in it.
---
Why would Bethesda alienate either type of player in either mode? 
---
It is even more simple than that:  add a toggle when creating new characters that makes them survival only "hard core" characters that only join worlds with other "hard core" characters. 
---
That lets all the current players enjoy the new mode and switch back and forth, but lets players opt-in with new characters to be survival only. 
---
I want to play with other players who got their items and built their characters in survival, not those who have farmed in adventure mode for months. 
---
I wish there was cross playing then I give you on
---
Bloodied isnt broken, they are on very low health lmao you can one shot them
---
Then why is the meta overflowing with melee? There isn't a counter to everything. It's still a work in progress and there's a lot that needs balancing still. 
---
Also, there have been significant fixes in item duping. As such, restarting characters could remove the items and keep the balance better. 
---
That said, I feel like a better solution is to have separate inventories for the two different modes. That way you still keep your level and perks, but have to grind for good survival equipment like everyone else. 
---
Then how about we push them to rebalance CLEARLY broken stuff and not restrict people on how they want to play. 
---
Ya I saw on Linustechtips a monitor with multiple crosshairs including a couple of penis ones. 
---
How do you know the future?
---
You haven't played the game long enough if you think nothing is "that OP" 
---
AAE
---
Sentinel
---
Caviler
---
Assassin
---
Unyielding+Bloodied+Nerd Rage+Adrenal Reaction   
---
That would be awesome in Survival, where a bunch of players would be working together to keep the VIP alive, while another group would be working to destroy the whole convoy.
---
You‚Äôd probably have to set up the quest so that the Raiders would have to take out a minimum number of guards first before taking out the VIP, or set relatively lower level limit so that the Raiders can‚Äôt one-shot the VIP though.
---
If legendaries are a thing in Survival I cannot see how this would work, however.  Maybe a weapon restriction would be necessary if that is the case.
---
I‚Äôve seen somewhere that the only masks people have so far are the owl, giant, witch, soldier, and toothy man.  I‚Äôd have to look up the plans but I bet there‚Äôs a list somewhere online 
---
I have been waiting to get my 1 shot in until it actually says legendary. Haven't missed one since. Missed a lot just hitting the early shot. Kinda like waiting on vats.
---
Thank you so much for the gold.  That was my first a
---
Let current players jump back and forth, but let anyone who creates a new character toggle it as survival only "hard core" and only be matched with other "hard core" players. Best of both worlds! 
---
In a couple weeks, it won't be a level playing field or fair chance anymore anyways so it doesn't matter. 
---
Idk this game is weird sometimes. Ok you couldn‚Äôt vats hit him but could you damage him without vats? Lol Idk why my comment got downvoted for telling the truth.
---
all of those 50 cals scrapped and i never got the heavy barrel, good to know that even something non-prime exists
---
Seriously. One buggy launch and a game that's not for everyone, and you'd think they hadn't released dozens of high profile badass games.
---
A single bad launch and lesser beloved game by an auxiliary branch of a developer/publisher isn't going to sink a behemoth like Bethesda, and all the people whom hope it will are douchebags.
---
What? You mean those 200+ beasts are just going to casually pretend they're survival characters? lol, that's ridiculous as hell.
---
No no no... too far, too fast. We're not supposed to be here yet. Someone call those nuke guys- leave nothing but scorched earth.
---
Sometimes things drop once for one day ... for the enire life of the game... That's rare. The event's not over yet. So hold your horses. It's exactly why I made the post.
---
There's certain events, quests and legendary item rewards that can ONLY be found on the Survivial servers. Check the Bethesda link, they're pretty interesting. I was on the same boat as you until I saw that incentive
---
Nobody has ever been one-shot killed via slap damage. This has been proven time and time again as people either not understanding game mechanics or exaggerating.   
---
All of the examples you previously cited have absolutely nothing at all to do with slap damage.  Your issue doesn't seem to be with slap damage itself, but rather with PvP elements that will still be built in to the PvE servers.  If you don't like those, I can completely understand.  But reducing slap damage to zero in no way impacts any of these examples.  They will happen regardless of whether you receive slap damage or not.
---
Yeah, if they waited about a month then opened it up to old characters too I think everyone would be happy. A bunch of low levels trying to level up in this harder, more dangerous game would be so much fun. It also would encourage players to make new characters while still letting their old ones be relevant eventually. Their current setup is just going to be a high level grief fest from the get go.
---
List of things they'd have to nerf to make people like you happy:
---
Bloodied effect 
---
Anti armor effect 
---
Just flat out take away explosive effect from all weapons
---
Unyielding effect 
---
Sentinel/cavalier effects
---
Assassin effect
---
Melee weapons in general
---
Instigating effect
---
Chameleon effect 
---
Stealth boys
---
Sneak damage
---
Vats critical shots 
---
I probably missed some but that's a pretty big list.  What they need to do is make other effects more viable, instead of nerfing everything good in this game. 
---
I dont know, I have been in 7 nuke launches now this past week. Guess I was just in the right server at the right time? They werent all that impressive though, the enemies that spawned especially like everyone is saying about Whitesprings is true. Not that impressive at all. I mainly farm for floral flowers and masses that I can get ultracite from. If I get a legendary glowt it is a bonus but I dont look for it anymore...
---
Yeah, because "hey, sociopaths are going to go out of my way to shit on my day" is a fun way to play a game. 
---
Seriously, stop being a sack of shit dude. 
---
I think you have to buy the atom shop one yourself still if it works like other atom shop items where it can‚Äôt be dropped or traded
---
Is the secret door open when you enter? With the pedestal exposed? 
---
1. They purged a great deal of dupes
---
2. Nothing is so OP that it has no counter and they nerfed the best weapons in the game already
---
3. Why would Bethesda punish people for putting more time into the game than you? Not many people want to throw away their 700+ hour characters so not allowing transfer would be spitting in the faces of the most loyal players.
---
No worries, I'm in no rush. Just trying to explain why some people may seem a bit more, uh, urgent in their concerns.
---
I'd take out gunsmith (have a spare rifle though) put demo expert or nerd rage/demo expert (most have Fireproof and Dense mods though,  negating most explosive damage) 
---
Adrenaline and  gun fu are questionable for  high level pvp, but could be useful against average groups that you can kill quickly.
---
You're specializing in I assume automatic Handmade, Combat/rafium rifle. So I'd plus up concentrated fire. Focus on killing one at a time with your  crits, but be ready to free aim on invisibles as well.  
---
There's many variables to consider,  but my toughest opponents run similar builds to this because of the extreme damage output possible with the critical headshots.
---
I honestly don't think this needs to become any easier.
---
Manage your encumbrance better.
---
There are weekly events, quests AND legendary weapons that can only be found on Survivial servers. So that's the incentive to play 
---
yeah the level 350 guys with full sets of armors are pretty happy about this, everyone else, no so much
---
it just made sense to have new characters be required for the new game mode
---
but only time will tell i guess
---
ill just be happy once the ability to destroy bases in adventure is removed
---
Thank you. I felt that Raquaza soft reset comment.
---
You got the shielded  plan for the armor. If you don't have the armor you can't shield it.find the plans for the armor itself or buy one from another player.
---
Ok
---
Intentionally going out of your way to make the game less fun for others because it's what makes your day more fun makes you a fucking dick, dude. 
---
Same here. I was extremely stoked when it was first announced because I assumed you would have to make a new character. Now I don‚Äôt even see myself playing it.
---
Also, why even have leaderboards when people aren‚Äôt starting on the same page?
---
I‚Äôm hoping we can do one switch back. I don‚Äôt much like PvP but I sure do want those legendaries.
---
&gt;  If everyone gets them, what makes them rare? 
---
It wouldn't be that "everyone gets them" but that "everyone can get them".  What would make it rare is if the person was willing to invest the time to do so (like your 2 year foray into Diablo II item farming.)
---
Make it rare by limiting the time it's available, make it rare by making it drop very infrequently.  But by putting both together, making it take 1000s of tries to get, but only giving you enough time to even attempt a couple hundred times, it creates at situation where not only is it rare, it becomes almost non-existent.  That's not rare, that just breeds contempt and hatred in your player base.  Why bother if there becomes a near zero statistical chance to acquire it?
---
If there is some hidden mechanic to it, some clever setup the Devs are giggling about, leaving the player base to fend for themselves half way thru the event with no answer or hint toward the right way also breeds that same hatred and distrust.
---
Okay 
---
I've been server hopping and it takes upwards of a couple of minutes for everything to load in.
---
Ran the event about 75 times. I managed to get 3 of every mask except the unobtainable ones. Even the Beret was fun for a bit because it glitched out a players head.
---
I'm disappointed but I'm curious to see if there is more to the event.
---
Last night I finally stopped trying...went to the cheeshaus to cook the squirrel bits I had on me, and when I came back out, went down, and that intangible bastard was no longer standing! He was quivering on the ground and I was *finally* able to claim my legendaries. If only I'd had the patience to wait 5 minutes every other darned time that happened...seriously. Wait five minutes.
---
what? it's not like i go looking to start shit with players who are clearly not interested in pvp...
---
I cannot believe they put up the Fasnacht event and didn't put a Drindl outfit (for women) and a Wermacht outfit (for men) in the Atom Store!
---
Heck, they even mention the Drindl in the adverts "...put on your drindl..." but there isn't one to wear!
---
/u/Ladydevann please tell them to rectify this!
---
I am looking forward to this but would really the requirement of having to create a new character.  I don't see any point that you can mode hop on the same one.  If that will be the case, shouldn't we have harder PVE weekly challenges so we can PVE unique legendary weapons?  I mean, look at the lever action reward you can get.  10% more damage to players plus 10% more damage while ADS?  So you can get rewarded with a weapon that can deal up to 20% more PVP damage.  Can we have something like that in PVE too?  With that being said, I'm super hyped for the survival beta.  Let's all give it a shot before we start hating on it so much.  
---
This is a good idea but there are two things that need to be addressed.  Survival characters NEED to be new, let everyone start on an even footing.  Second for adventure mode please expand the no build zone near the whitesprings golf course.  I don't think anyone want to have invulnerable missile turrets stealing kills when they are trying to farm there. 
---
A little disappointed that you don't drop everything on death. When Bethesda announced that survival would be a PvP oriented game mode I was thinking something sort of like Rust.
---
Show me a shop anywhere that routinely has a single product on sale for a single day for an idiotic price, and can then never be purchased anywhere else ever again. 
---
Dome key 2, not 7...
---
An event that is 2/7th of the way done? No you dont organize a party game and prizes when a party starts, you do that shit before the party even starts and you dont tell people exclusive details when the game is almost done. The point isnt "let's just wait and see". The point is they should be transparent about their own event.
---
I didn‚Äôt know that ok thank I willing to give you the mask for free
---
i use dot have a teen gob line back in the day, remember those?
---
As long as it stays on the survival servers. I'm all for it. Leave the builders in adventure. And the war in survival
---
I think it was the greatest troll move in Bethesda's history Bravo my hat is off to them. I've been enjoying the "I got rebanned" post I just get my popcorn and enjoy.
---
Hey ladydevann can we get a reason why everyone was banned again?
---
Someone said the exact same thing I said within the same hour and got upvoted. üòÇüòÇ
---
Heavy Gunner, Adrenaline and Tenderizer all work nicely with the 50 Cal
---
That's not that OP. I can kill those people ridiculously easy with a simple gamma gun. 125 rads a shot on a full auto is the counter.
---
14% chance of getting a rare mask... sounds ok and pretty rare to me.
---
I personally don't see an issue here.
---
Yes, allow us to change our underwear that counts as "nude", no more tighty whities. I want Nukacola, Pick Axe Pilsner etc boxers.
---
Also, before the fight you can swap starched genes out. You're taking the risk of gaining unwanted mutations from radiation weapons but you could allot a 2 star Serendipity in its place, for example.
---
I played stress test, through beta, and everyday since. I‚Äôm huge into PvP.  You haven‚Äôt played that long if you think you can have all of those at once.  Unyielding and bloodied builds are really strong, same with cav or sentinel assassin builds. But none of these are unbeatable. These are the pinnacle of the end-game builds and gears, they‚Äôre naturally strong. But none of those are unbeatable, especially when encountering each other 
---
If you play with your friends on your main character, that is the character you use to play with them. If you want to play survival, just make a new character. New mode, new mechanics, new characters. If you have time to play the game at all you have time to start a new character. If you're only playing with your friends that don't want to play survival, be reasonable, you're probably not going play survival anyway because you're going to play with your friends instead. 
---
Yes it is, new players are still new whether you got to bring yours or not? üòÇ
---
I mean, the big question Bethesda needs to answer with this beta test is this:
---
#Is survival mode fun?
---
In every online game, there are Haves and Have-Nots. If you have a core group of gaming buddies, plenty of time, and are baseline competent at playing video games, you will be able to achieve a level of power and efficiency that a player who does not have these things will not. As a developer, the challenge is to make sure the gap between those two kinds of players is big enough to allow the Haves to feel like their investment is worth it, but not so big that the Have-Nots get completely turned off by how much they are getting annihilated.
---
So, how does transferring characters between Survival and Adventure modes affect this balancing act? I think it's safe to say that the Haves will have a pretty noticeable leg up on the Have-Nots because right out the gate they will have much better gear, they will be much more organized, and their builds will be much more effective. So the complaint that allowing people to transfer characters will make Survival much harder for those who are not playing religiously definitely holds water.
---
**However, the Haves would have just as much as an advantage if characters could not be brought over.** Simply playing more and with friends will allow the Haves to farm gear more effectively, so they will eventually and inevitably outpace the Have-Nots. Therefore, restricting transfers is a time-dependent fix.
---
All that said, the concern that hardcore players could stomp casual players is very real and should be on Bethesda's mind. It seems like their approach to balancing things is not by locking transfers but by introducing certain systems that make things more challenging the higher you are on the totem pole. It's not bad design, to be honest; systemic, time-independent fixes should have a better chance of addressing the fundamental problems.
---
I also like that they're adding certain rewards to chase beyond just the flat XP boost; that 50 cal looks dirty. So, so dirty. It's an interesting take on Destiny 2's seasonal pinnacle rewards, and I'm very curious to see where Bethesda will ultimately go with this.
---
Overall, I'm cautiously optimistic, but we'll need to see what you have to do to actually be able to claim these rewards before I render a final verdict.
---
The only decent thing is the removal of slap damage/unwanted PvP, although hopefully everyone who wants to PvP will have moved to Survival.
---
That always pissed me off.  I am wandering and one or two 180+ tanks start chucking grenades at me non-stop.. I know I cant take them but ignoring them costs stims,..
---
I'm pretty sure I get disconnected everytime I'm about to get a rare mask /s
---
Sweet that‚Äôs what I was leaning towards. Thanx
---
&gt; even a bird brained Dev
---
A typical Dev for fallout 76, thus.
---
It is only going to be a fresh start for two weeks.  Any new players after that are screwed.  I like that we can move freely between game modes.  Reddit is the minority here.  Not everyone plays for hours everyday.  Not everyone can grind new characters out.  Not everyone has friends that want to play in Survival too.   
---
We just dropped the last one of this server. We are switching server after this and doing 3 more 
---
More the insane levels of anti consumer practices I'd like to see them punished for. Releasing 76 as it was sits among them. 
---
Do you have anymore recipes I'm only missing 4 of them
---
51 and enjoying wading into mobs of mutants and mole miners. Power Armor melee build, so there's always knives in the mix. Stabby stabby. Gt QuakeSumo 
---
There is a best of both worlds solution:  let current characters switch back and forth as it is planned now, but let new characters be created as survival only "hard core" characters that get matched with only other "hard core" characters. 
---
I would love to play a survival only character and struggle through the world with other survival only players on an even playing field. 
---
Me too 
---
I'm nowhere near end-game meta, so I likely have no idea what I'm talking about, but showing up on the map for the top 3 longest-surviving dwellers seems like it will be more beneficial for sprinting melee rather than stealth/sniper builds. Unless there's a way to counteract showing up on the map whilst in the top 3.
---
Dense mods and Fireproof perk makes those overconfident compensating bastards cry tears of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre cheating!‚Äù ‚ÄúHacker!‚Äù When they pull the TSE and get downed by my Swing Speed butter knife
---
That'd be cool. I've said the whole time I've been disappointed with the lack of "rebuilding". It'd kind of suck to only have one per server, maybe there could be a few. Otherwise it'd get done, and if you weren't part of rebuilding it'd be difficult to find one probably. 
---
Fine by me.  I'd actually be kind of ticked if they were significantly better than anything in Adventure.
---
Hey could you get an update on a reason why everyone was rebanned yesterday?
---
Don't impose your healthy water drinking lifestyle on me :P
---
The ‚Äúmeta‚Äù clearly hasn‚Äôt been established. Nothing is overflowing with melee, it‚Äôs overflowing with unarmed though. I do believe Unarmed needs to be nerfed a bit, even I use it and I believe this. But really nothing compares to a crit-build with a handmade. 
---
I am killing The Commie Whacker Gang and am starting The Church of Lootcifer (praise be) will be making Discord, and xbox group. There is also a filthy casual xbox group as well.
---
Just max out your Basher Perk and use it as a melee
---
I'm a rather low-level guy atm, but I plan on playing in this mode just for the extreme risk added--I may even try my hand at being a pacifist (or as close to it as possible) in this game mode. I don't want a softcore experience in the post-apocalypse, even if my character is a wimp!
---
Cool.  I won‚Äôt be on till later tonight since I work till 6 PM Pacific time.  What‚Äôs your GT so I can send a message when I‚Äôm on?
---
I really hoped they would start with fresh characters, but I wonder if they will change the ability to transfer characters when the game mode is fully released. 
---
They are saying it‚Äôs beta so they might be looking to get better idea of what end game pvp will be like with this setup. 
---
Isn't the idea of a rare drop for it to be rare? The event has only been going on a few days. 
---
Heres some help. Most of it wont be true anymore when Bethesda gives in to the toxic PvE carebear demands on a pacifist change but hered how you do it...
---
 You are the NPC. Your friends can be the "bad guy NPC"
---
approach a player: "Help, our kindom is in danger.. We need a hero... Are you that hero?"
---
They say yes. Follow you to a quest giving location. 
---
"First you must prove your strength, take the nearby workshop. Claim it for our great Kingdom! Then you may meet our king and help save [insert kingdom name]
---
When they get back from claiming the workshop they meet the next quest giver. The king or whatever you want
---
He sends them on the escort mission
---
Your friends can now tag his Workshop, adding the ability to fight the player on a quest. Dont take the workshop... Just tag it. 
---
Now your friends can be the NPCs attacking the player on his quest. Dumb down your damage output by using shitty weapons based on the level of the player. 
---
Im talking about custom quests we write. Not guiding players on lame betheda queata with no choice or consequence. 
---
You are 100% correct. My issue is that we are changing code to fix a problem that will still exist after the change simply because people do not understand game mechanics. 
---
In my opinion this change actually makes griefing worse as it puts another tool in the box of motivated griefers.
---
I'm a console gamer. I've never been in a position to by a gaming PC.
---
yes, i hoped too to not carry the existing character on this new mode, all will start with the TSE weapons
---
Is 2 the T51-b paint key?   I seem to recall that entire thing is in instanced containers requiring a series of container finds to get the progressing keys for.  Starting by the Pylon in Cranberry Bog. 
---
Which part are you stuck at?
---
That's what I do everyone else usually just leaves lol 
---
1. I didnt get rebanned.
---
2. They cant keep the bans permanent without actual evidence or proof of a violation of terms of service. The reason for this is because it is a service people paid for and you cannot deny said service without grounds legally. This is why all of the bans said "temporary suspension" because there was no way to tell the dupers from the traders.
---
I know, right?  I'm ecstatic that the PvPers get their own world to grief in, while the rest of us finally get to completely ignore what little PvP the game tried to force on us.
---
It always boggle my mind why EVERY online game all the way back to Ultima Onlina has to learn that the PvE crowd and the PvP crowd have only a very small overlap, and that trying to cater to both at once leads to making both unhappy.  
---
Just give them their own servers with their own rule-sets, and everyone wins.  
---
Can't confirm the Sloth, but I've had this happen with Gulpers frequently in the last few weeks: at death, they glitch into their t-rex pose, and are un-lootable.
---
I'll try Bloody Mess; thanks phr3k.
---
Would that be the x01 or the ultracite pa
---
I think they should model the WOW trading system.  You start a trade.  You drop the item you want from your inventory into a window.  The person drops the item they are giving in the window.  Someone clicks the trade button and it 'locks' the items in the trade.  if the person wants to accept the trade they click trade as well and the swap is done.  If they try to modify the contents of the trade window the trade button is unclicked for the other player so no stealing can occur.
---
Bad, bad, terrible. 
---
Why double the cap loss? Now the game is actively discouraging leveling!
---
I‚Äôm not losing 350 caps for one death! Even 175 was ridiculous.
---
Keep it at 50 or 100 for people over level 50.
---
"Fully Completed"?
---
As long as it gets PvPers out of Adventure I'm all for it.
---
What console? I'd love to see both you and your friend's builds. 
---
Yeah that is really the only thing that I can think of as well without just gutting all the pvp elements from adventure mode. But that doesn't sound very adventurous.
---
I mean they usually break when you need a stimpack to begin with so no point really... it's been somewhat of a necessarity in fo4's survival mode since it eliminated the issue of explosives aoe counting each body part as seperate target but in here?
---
I feel you, it's a painful grind with no guarantee of success. Very much like life AFK. 
---
I doubt there's some secret to get a chance at a rare/exceptionally rare drop in this case. I don't see a problem with it being so hard. Technically, you could get one for completing a single event. If even only one person in the whole of the wasteland gets one, that's just fine too. Nobody actually needs any of these masks. I've been doing the event constantly, only taking breaks to keep up with my ammo farming for caps and the occasional repair. If i never get one, oh well, somehow i think I'll live and continue to enjoy fo76.
---
I think people are being far to harsh with Beth over this game as a whole. I feel that complaints regarding drop rates of masks only serves to distract from fixing real issues like server stability and balancing gear/mobs. 
---
Dealing slap damage to another character costs them nothing except time, ammunition, and wear and tear on their weapons.  And if you play the game often enough, and wisely enough, ammo isn't the rare commodity people make it out to be.  I can't remember, for example, the last time I actually had to craft ammo at a workbench. The person being slapped, however, would be repeatedly using stimpacks when their health got low enough and suffer deteriorating armor condition from the sustained attacks.  Which zero slap damage now protects the player against.  
---
So weird I guess it just depends on the server. I used to get 5 to 10 at ws now its like 1 or 2.
---
I've only done the event once so far.  I didn't even know you had to do ANY of that.  I must have joined it late b/c all I did was escort the bots along the parade route (along with everyone else.)
---
Correct.
---
I don't get why people are so happy. PvP was never a big issue except for the dumb way it was implemented. Hardly anyone was affected more than once or twice and usually through some fault or ignorance of game mechanics. 
---
I‚Äôve only gotten my first one after doing the event at lease 20 times, for some it isn‚Äôt to rare but other have troubles acquiring it 
---
First time doing the event yesterday,blue screen.
---
On the bright side, it‚Äôs a massive flex if you get your hands on one 
---
Unless they have some really stacked armor and damage mitigation perks.  Then you just hit them with some rads ;)
---
It does absolutely protect the player, who may also be the griefer.
---
I'm with you. I doubt it has anything to do with weight. I would be super happy if they just made all the weapons/armor less weight.
---
Probably would have been  lederhosen instead of a wehrmacht costume. But that is still more of a Oktoberfest thing then what fasnacht is based on, so keep your fingers crossed for 6 months!
---
Except that balance is lost a week later, when the diehard grinders are already well past 50 with reasonably strong gear (maybe not perfect legendaries, but far better than any casual player is going to have). A fresh start sounds nice, but its positive effects would really only be apperent for the first few weeks, while for others, both current and future players, being forced to have two separate characters for PVP and PVE would be cumbersome. Letting people use their character for both modes is probably the better long term strategy.
---
I'm pretty excited for it as well, I'll finally get the chance to really do some people hunting and live out the real raider lifestyle 
---
Thanks! I really hope they do this, and I want to get visibility on the idea as much as possible.
---
All of my friends who have stopped playing would come back and play if this were implemented, and I would be as excited as I was on launch day to play all over again if they did!
---
Ah, I guess that horse still has some life in it. Keep beating it. Regardless of how it was handled, it's handled now afaik. Also, we're talking about server stability, not the differences in fabric of a preorder item. 
---
great job! very homey and feels like a real livable space!  i have an uncle in a rural community that has a backyard just like that heheh
---
this game has a player base of less than a million people split across like 3 platforms. There is limits to how many hoppers you can make for loading, even pubg ran into "we split the community too many ways" with 4 gametypes and it was the most popular game in history at the time. This is a game that sold 2 million copies and has ps4 trophies that show less than a quarter of people making it to mid game quests
---
I got that two. Took video but haven‚Äôt posted it yet. 
---
As a rule I try to stay away from Whitesprings or I'll spend hours there instead of seeing the rest of the map but yesterday I got about a dozen legendaries there. Of course they were all crap but it was quite a bit 
---
I already stored all the other holotapes. If you re-read my comment I was saying that even those 18 Overseer's holotapes clutter up the holotape tab, and the insert a holotape popup menu on a terminal. It would be nice to get those out of my inventory, but there's no way to do that.
---
38 here!
---
I don't see it the same way that you do. As far as adventure mode is concerned, the game has made great strides in balance, server stability, and quality of life improvements. I had a problem with not being able to interact with real people at first, but some of the engine limitations that other game developers have talked about kinda cleared that up for me, and I just reconceptualized the world as one of extreme isolation and devastation. As far as PvE goes, anyone who's been playing since launch is basically grinding for gear and waiting for new content, so if you haven't played much of the game, there's plenty for you to do, and everything is much more polished to help that experience.  
---
As far as PvP goes, I think there absolutely needs to be some tuning, like not allowing certain PvE items to transfer between servers (weapons/armor/chems), or by forcing everyone who wants to play Survival exclusively to create a new character. Personally, the build that I have on my main character is \*not\* good for PvP, but if I made a character that was designed for PvP and leveled it up some and then jumped from Adventure to Survival, I could certainly have fun in that environment. People in Survival mode will probably be less interested in the story content, or launching nukes, etc. so it's not like the developers will have to do much more than design interesting events/new weapons/gear every once in a while. Then, if you want to switch back to adventure mode with that character to play new story, you can't bring over any of the special/legendary equipment that you earned in Survival.   
---
I can see a way for Bethesda to capture some of the Battle Royale audience, while still giving the exploration/story/vendor type characters plenty to do. 
---
So the one that is just sitting in the random locker down by mount blair area?
---
Forgive me for not remembering exactly which key, 2 or 3, has exactly what items inside of it, as it's been what... 2 months or more since I acquired them and opened their domes.
---
Yeah, I recommend Monongah as Poseidon and Thunder Mountain seem to get challenged regularly when I take them over.  People usually leave me alone at Monongah.
---
If you said the one with the alien blaster plan it would make it easier. It‚Äôs hard to remember which is which just based on the number lol
---
Its a videogame. Your language above is worse than my actions in game. Reported
---
Do you remember where you saw this? I'd like to check out the interview about robot survival effecting rewards.
---
if you were to run it 24/7 for a week straight. its not 14% per attempt, its 14% if you were a robot doing nothing but the event for a week straight.

Bethesda &gt; "Hold our nuka dark rum."

Exactly, i have a v√≠deo recorded on Xbox a guy stays almost 5 minutes slaping me without reason with a deathclaw gaunt, i have used 3 Stimpaks and then leave till i die as the guy didnt stop...
---
its all good, i saw the other comments going on lol
---
Erm, do we have images for the masks? Because I‚Äôm sure as shit I got a goblin!
---
At least we know what juicebag will be making his next video about.....
---
Yeah, and event rewards in general sometimes, as well, won't pop up for ages.
---
man, if only had more upvotes to give you! keep fighting the good fight and helping your friend
---
its nice to see something positive out there, the real world seems to be devolving
---
Does this mean that players nukes can no longer damage our camps?
---
44 and lvl. 105. My three sons (15,17,&amp; 19) are not even close to my lvl. Lmao. I can still even out sk8 them. I won't lie, I'm starting to get out of breath. 
---
I go to [fo76map.com](https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1260,1259,1252,1247,1243,1256), pick what I'm looking for in terms of vendors/resources/workshops, then narrow it down to a few locations before scouting them out. I mean, Grafton Station is close to water per the map, but it's nasty water and there's not much else nearby. Last three times I've wanted to move, it's helped narrow things down to 3 or fewer locations.
---
Mediocre weapons. Kinda cool names.
---
I'll give you one. I replied to you because you claim to have first hand experience vs the other saying they heard that was the case.
---
Did you get smacked while the event was running or did it happen before it started?
---
&gt; Survival mode is pointless because of this.
---
Nope, I definitely plan on sending new characters through it strictly for the xp buff
---
I stopped reading after I saw that characters carried over. Sad to see that the outcry over that decision didn't sway their choice at all.
---
You can buy old man winter in the shop
---
It wont be three days of not getting killed. It will be three days of constantly being killed by groups of higher level raiders, being denied access to best farming locations, that ultimately, after three days, entering into 'resistance is futile' mode.
---
This will be interesting to witness and I might give it a try but as a PvE player I'm not jumping into it too fast.
---
You deserve an upvote for offering a benefit-of-the-doubt response, even if it wasn't accurate in this case.
---
I got the effigy the first time, and I'm pretty sure I got it a second time so it's sitting in my known plans or was given away. I've already given away some doubles I'd gotten.
---
Cool.  Yeah I remember taking pictures of Mew and thinking how cool it was. Damn I'm getting old lol
---
I do what i do to get caps and junk. 
---
I view other players as enemies. Im allowed to. Its part of the game by design. Not "being a dick" at all.
---
Your assumption is incorrect. I dont enjoy your misery. Thats why im giving you hints on how to avoid it. Like keeping your health up higher.
---
I hope BGS is proud of the mess they let happen.  "Raiders" hahaha.  White trash of the PvP world is more like it.
---
I would probably point out all the huge, irredeemable flaws in this PvP mode for the hundreds time if I gave a single damn about the whole PvP thing.   
---
I just can't express how much I don't care about it.
---
It would be nice if there was almost a matchmaking methodology where "Server X allows players between 1-25, 26-50, 50 and beyond" wouldn't be perfect but would help.
---
Yeah i know but I wish the game was more encouraging to role play, to me it seams kinda lame and less special knowing that you can join all factions and it makes everything feel less special in my opinion, but yes I would definitely buy plans especially because my character wants to open a raider bar that sells chems, food and drinks so just need to find someone to trade plans with
---
You are? What is there to be excited about that you didn‚Äôt know about already? The legendary weapons possibly 
---
imo, average players don't deserve the rarest items in the game. sounds silly, but the rarest items are a trophy for the nerdy hardcore grinders. I've done the event at least 50 times (server hopping) and i don't have it. it's just the way the cookie crumbles. i don't feel like the game owes me anything. i'm just going to keep trying and hope i get it. if i don't, owell.
---
That's kind of disheartening, but I enjoy the event enough to do it some more times even if I never get a rare mask. I really like the owl one, so at least I have one I like. 
---
But what if the have unyielding sentinel with +25 rad resist.... My whole set is this...
---
The dynamic and ad-hoc nature of the servers spinning up or joining to them takes care of this. Even if 100 players only are playing with "hard core" characters in a region, that is still a few servers to jump between. 
---
There could be tens of thousands of players or only a few hundred playing at any given time in a region and you wouldn't know the difference based on how they set up the worlds now. 
---
I wonder if we'll see something pop up before joining friends games. What if someone you game with is in Survival and you only want to play Adventure. Joining could be tricky if they have not thought about that.
---
Around 20 - 30
---
39, play on xbox.
---
I have one friend who's close to my age, but most of the people I play with are in their 20s... maybe a few early 30s.
---
Lol, right. 
---
If the decorator is in all the sessions, could picking the specific decorations unlock different masks?
---
Same here. I was at 2560 x 1440  before the patch. There were stutters, but only now and then. 
---
After the patch it was stutter-galore; it actually made me feel sick.
---
Had to go down to 1920 x 1200, (or 1920 x 1080, can't check it right away). I had to set the shadows to Low, only thing High now is the detail and I still get stutters when the program is e.g. building up a town. When I'm out in the fields, the fps is 55-60. Older i7, GTX970 OC, 24GB RAM GDDR3, SSD. (The cpu is not the bottleneck, because it doesn't get above about 75%).  Temperatures also stay well within limits.
---
I've never even heard of the raider longcoat. Where's it supposed to spawn and what does it look like? 
---
I'm guessing they made them all Protectrons because Sentry Bots would be overpowered (and too big for the bridges), Eyebots would die too easily and Assaultrons would pull a Leeroy Jenkins too often which would disrupt the flow of the parade. 
---
**Best of both worlds solution:**   Let new character optionally tag themselves as "Hard core" that are bound to survival mode only. 
---
This gives you (and me) exactly what we want, but lets current characters switch between the two with other existing characters as it is currently designed. 
---
I would love to play a survival only character and struggle through the world with other survival only players on an even playing field.
---
Everybody wins!
---
I have picked up someones legendary purge before and have had an endless stream of popups for 10 minutes. Sometimes it gets stuck and shows the same item over and over. I've also had it show me a legendary that I already had, like the weapon I've been using for the past 3 months. It wouldn't be a big deal if I could see my sneak status while it was up. But I'm stuck in one place now because I can't verify if I'm hidden or in danger.
---
i know people will over and over say you cant get killed on pacifist unless you have a workshop, but 2 days ago my teammate and i were at whitesprings vendors, my friend was repairing her weapons, and someone came in and killed us both 1 shot.
---
We both had no workshops as they arent worth the trouble anymore
---
the other player that killed us then messaged us both in shock saying he didnt think he was able to kill us
---
he found us again and then gifted us both a ton of loot
---
so, something strange seems to be going on there
---
Some people just want to feel their dickholes burn.
---
"I don't want to set your dickhole on fiiiiiirrrre, I just want to start a ban on your account!"
---
New song suggestion for the Fallout 76 jukebox, have 3 dog say "This one's for you &lt;name of recently banned player&gt;"
---
I got a Mutants Fat Man from the Sloth and one of the mininukes from a Suicider and thought "This will be a great way to light the effigy on fire".  It was pretty damn great to see 6 people run away from it so quickly. 
---
Well, for the sake of argument regarding coins. The 50/50 coin toss really isn't 50/50 ‚Äî it's closer to 51/49, biased toward whatever side was up when the coin was thrown into the air.  So for all intents and purposes, yeah it‚Äôs a 50/50.
---
I've been away for awhile, how is default mode not already survival mode if you have to eat and stuff? What's new?
---
I liked the unpredictably of it.  Hunting bounties was just another random "event."  My fear is the potential fragmentation this change will cause.
---
That, and it's not like Adventure mode is flawless.  They're opening a new can of worms before they fixed the one they already opened.
---
Clearly that has to be nerfed! /s
---
Honestly not sure in that one.  That's +100 rad resist so I'd think it would help, just not sure how many more shots that buys you.  
---
I wasn't even doing the event, but my PC crashed hard and just shut off.
---
It was after it started. After everyone‚Äôs name becomes yellow and you are teamed.
---
Everything is an assumption. Some like to be positive others trash the game, im on the positive side. the amount of days the event last in this case 7 "second half" would be the last 3 days. Meaning this upcoming weekend when most people have allot of time to play. Then again it could be so rare that nobody on the reddit has it, but non reddit people might. Then again it might be glitched and we'll likely get an extension to the event and an apology.
---
Please PM a resume, cover letter and headshot. 
---
My Brahmin and yao guai get along famously. Been at least a week since either was killed; each time it was by a player.
---
Seriously... I have no friends or teams in fallout 76, but I don't grief.  I am full of wonder at the cool game and cool things people do.
---
It's not the game, it's them.
---
I know Bethesda didn‚Äôt break anything with there last patch right. 
---
I have a similar build.  I'm having some fun with Sneak and Covert Operative, and I rotate Ammosmith in when crafting because I chew through 5.56 firing rounds off indiscriminately.
---
Same here. I don't usually get excited about shooters and PvP, but this sounds fun. Especially if they do a good job rebalancing the builds like they stated. It would be great to see more variety in builds. 
---
I do share the concern that others have posted about players restocking in Adventure mode though. I  am a casual player so I  would automatically be at a disadvantage against higher levels, but this is not as much of an issue if everyone else has to scramble for ammo and supplies just like me.  Letting folks run back to easy mode to grind out another couple thousand ammo and restock their med supplies seems like it is just going to suck a lot of the challenge and fun out of it.
---
Make it true Survival Bethesda - no switching back and forth.  Limited amounts of ammo and supplies that everyone is competing for sounds a whole lot more fun than trashing the Survival economy with tons of ammo and supplies.
---
I would love to play this game as a true survival game.
---
They can implement smart level scaling.
---
How do you know they won't change it?
---
Also, statistics?
---
I hope not.  
---
What I think is coming is seasons where everyone starts fresh...
---
Don't know.  I got the beret last night on PC on my third go around.  Other than that I got the toothy man and owl masks and some plans so far.
---
well... and the radiation...  that happens too.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the banana hammocks!
---
I'm not going to be disrespectful to you neither will I tell you what my age because I was personal information, but I would tell you to point blank and plain as day that you need to stop being disrespectful because that is very immature coming from you. I'm not really being disrespectful to you in the first place so I don't know what really gives you the right to be disrespectful to me but I'm going to end this conversation and goodbye because arguing with a foolish isn't worth it. Repent before it is too late for The Lord Jesus Christ is returning very very soon Amen.
---
How do you know that won't change at some point in the future? Again...the event is not over...
---
I see three types of people in the game. PvE, PvP-compatible, PvP focused. My concern with the survival servers being separate from adventure is that there'd be space for PvE people, space for PvP-focused people, and no middle ground which would train PvP-compatibles into PvP-focused. Having just two options, I'd prefer the second one to be welcoming for PvP-compatibles, so that the amount of PvP-focused people would increase, allowing for some real, gang-based tensions to arise within this game. What you say gives us three options, one for each. I do believe that to be the most representative of the current playerbase. This is why I cannot deny your idea my support.
---
how do you turn off refection?
---
Doesn't look to be any time soon.  The roadmap doesn't even mention it.
---
They're not the best rolls out there, but they are *guaranteed* (assuming no bugs) rewards for quests which is cool. Considering how people are hoarding and trying to collect rare masks, I'm sure these weapons will also generate a lot of demand on the market too
---
Just sentinel alone doesnt stack up as strong compared to sentinel assassin, so someone can still get more damage on you before you do on them
---
I saw a guy who 'disappeared' when he crouched down. However, when bringing up the map, his tag still showed up.
---
XP is bumped up by 20% and it's more intense of an experience knowing that another wanderer could immediately turn hostile and kill you. 
---
I'll probably be playing it mainly and I don't plan on player hunting either.
---
This guy was even able to rejoin our server after he left once and find me after I blocked him. 
---
YES!
---
I sincerely hop the PVPers have a good time on their own servers!  Keeps the game going, keeps player base up, likely keeps ATOM sales going, and I get to not have to worry about griefers while I play adventure!
---
im the same when drunk when i meet a girl at the bar right at last call
---
Duping.
---
Oh definitely, they will be collector's items for sure. 
---
we desperately need factions for pvp.
---
TSE ultracite laser rifle with 90% less weight 
---
Yeah I‚Äôve found a full set of this armor while adventuring through the wasteland, I was planning on creating a melee build and combining it with a DCG I have with the same effect. So in theory that‚Äôs 95% of damage reduced which counts pretty incredible, especially against an Ass/sent build as they‚Äôre not running away from you anytime soon. 
---
If you‚Äôre on XB1 id be down to do some testing 
---
I'm glad you like it.
---
omg i love this reply!!!!
---
Do you honestly think they'll change it in the next 5 days?
---
How else am i to know who else wants to PvP? 
---
Every event i get a good skirmish
---
Well with that then the rad resist perk I take a lot, but I don't think it needs to be needed, a shot gun with the stagger perk or rifle with tank killer ( I think that's what it's called)  owns any sentinel perk
---
That would be Vim :D
---
Cheaters duplicated them in the millions. If every single player received equal amounts, your inventory would have hundreds of items.
---
I hope it‚Äôs around the time they release the camera update 
---
Wait what?  Can you see everyone's camps and fast travel to them?
---
A few months ago it was INCREDIBLY easy to duplicate any weapon or item. This allowed people to flood the markets with TSE weapons, rare items, and rare plans. 
---
Now any Joe Shmo can purchase a TSE handmade for 5k and duplicate it himself to then sell again and buy more weapons. 
---
The dealbreaker for you was a new mode? It‚Äôs not mandatory you know. 
---
33 bro
---
On the PvE side no PvP should be happening unless you take a site which allows it which already says it in the warning before you take it. 
---
I‚Äôve never seen it honestly it will probably be released when the vault raids come 
---
ive gotten the toothy man mask 4 times in a row....F!
---
How about we give it a Chan before immediately assuming the worst?
---
Oh right... Looking in the locker at Mt Blair I assume? 
---
You still can do it on PVP mode, stays on the top of the list and you will have a huge bounty...
---
Hahaha. If he has a Nuka Cola fridge at his backyard too, I want to visit your uncle's house :P
---
Thanks for your kind words. 
---
Well, for clarification, yes alien blaster ammo/plan... :-)
---
Well no matter how many times I visit or serverhop it never spawns in the locker...
---
Your litterally making one of the worst arguments against this I've heard, "they worked hard in the new servers and that's not fair". That's like saying you deserve all my legendarys because I worked for them and you didn't.
---
As it stands survival will be dead in the water why play a more dangerous game mode? Cause a junkies switchblade definitely won't be why people join there. If they locked players into it players would want to play it to both keep up and get away from the shitty dupe economy in adventure instead. I planned on returning to fo76 for survival but unless they lock players to iether adventure or survival I won't bother and I'm sure many more are just like me.
---
That's my thoughts exactly. I have already started my raider alt for Survival, he's only level 21, so I expect to get my butt kicked.
---
Guaranteed legendary rewards, better XP gains. I personally HATE PVP and wouldn't play this game if their Survival mode was the only mode. 
---
However, those incentives would make me hop over to the Survival mode now and then.
---
LOL, no worries.  I get little slaps all the time.  I ignore it.
---
It is trolling though, but on the spectrum of things, no big deal.  Not like you are ruining the event like that other guy
---
What if the hardcore player can't get 1 out of 5 masks taking part on the event 6 hours each day for 7 days?
---
Yes, but considering there's already Combat Armor in 76 it would have to have some sort of different name. Then again, they could probably just call it the Classic Combat Armor.
---
The dome 2 key used to spawn in a locker in the Mire but that seems to have been a bug, and never should have been there in the first place. It has it's own mini-quest. And it's a pretty fun little quest. Very similar to the new dome quest in that they both have very hidden locations and one-time passwords.
---

Can‚Äôt wait til they make camps invincible as well so you lose all reason to play and leave the community. 
---
A lot of people aren't as hardcore as you, and don't have the time/inclination to grind up another character after spending months getting their current one the way they like it.
---
honestly keeping armor and weapons. is what makes it acceptable for me.
---
lossing materials/junk and soem random aid.  isn't the end of the world, but its still something where i will fight tooth and nail for that adhesive and aluminum.    so its a good balance =D
---
now we just need text chat so i can talk to people and form a BoS patrol group.
---
I found out awhile back about being able to jump through the brick windows, I just tried it again and It looks like to can't jump through them.
---
Idk if you can still click on workstations through windows though.
---

---
You also lose more caps from being killed in PvP, along with dropping all junk/aid items for the killer.
---
best anti-mole I've found is a tactical 45 combat rifle .. or a Vampire machete :)
---
Armor: I'm not getting too many duplicates, either, but I'm also finding I dont need a matched set to get the associated bonus.
---
So I have a chameleon arm, I forget what the other arm is, a cloking chest piece, a reduced damage from mutant leg, and a reduced damage from ghouls leg.
---
It really is difficult to picture how an SBQ battle would work in this mode. XD
---
only if everyone is constantly leaving and rejoining. If there is 10 active servers and 20 people leave each then you just have 10 servers with 3 people alone on. (or read that as "20 more leave than join in the same time period")
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more, this would be awesome!
---
Yup, there are multiple ways to deal with various "meta" builds. Which is why I wish people would stop calling for everything to be nerf'd 
---
I've been saying since launch that the game needs level dependant servers 1to 20, 21 to 40 and 41 to 60. Maybe pointless in adventure mode now, seeing as there are few new players, but would be good for survival.
---
there are conditions too tho..all of the robots must survive ..depending on the outcome that affects everyone's RNG drop
---
With all the complaints about duping and dupers I find it disingenuous if people have bought items like this from other players or sources yet complain about duping... 
---
I get that people do farm the SBQ and other sources! No disrespect to them at all! But there is no way this much is out there that wasn‚Äôt duped...
---
I think it would be cool to have open co-op workshops as well. Maybe some system where the more players joining and  working on them the bigger rewards they give.  And the better you work as a team the better the rewards. 
---
eh initially i didnt want PvP cause i dont want to lose weapons/armor or be spawn camped.
---
and honestly none of those are concerns now as all i lsoe is junk and aid. which i can accept and appeals to me for hunting others (I WILL STEAL THE ADHESIVE)
---
I hope so, when is that again? This weekly or the nuke winter stuff?  
---
They didn‚Äôt put it on there they grouped it with player vending and the camera that comes out April 9th
---
That's actually summer, being red
---
Ive done the event maybe 10 times and got all non rare masks. If anyone wants a toothy man mask on xbox hmu
---
I do not endorse this. I vote no. 
---
Stop making PVP that no one wants! Crank out more pve content
---
Have better shit on my mule. There should be some reward. Those are good legendaries, not meta but usable.
---
Yeah I mean I‚Äôm more of a hardcore mode kind of guy so I‚Äôm probably in the minority of people who enjoy weight management and things like that lol, I just seem to remember a lot of posts from people a lot smarter than me explaining how it doesn‚Äôt matter how the number of items doesn‚Äôt contribute to server instability. Alas I don‚Äôt think many truly understand it and I was hoping for a legitimate response explaining to me how I‚Äôm wrong instead of the witch hunting that happens a lot on this subreddit when it comes to bans.
---
There will always be players who are better than you. There are always people who can put more hours in than you.  
---
If everyone starts on a level playing field and doesn't have access to survival mode then they will nobody will be able to accumulate the same amount of wealth as what they can do currently, definitely not at the same pace. While there will always be a gap between the casuals and the hardcore, that gap would be much tighter if both modes were separate with no crossover.
---
Oh shoot... do they stack?  I just assumed they did.
---
Vampire is nice when being swarmed by them in melee.  Good idea.
---
Sorry I should have added that we were all waiting to jump back in and currently don't play. We all took a break for bethesda to get this game at a stable state and to introduce PVP
---
other than sharing characters across the modes, this looks like it'll be pretty cool. that factor does have the potential to completely ruin this though.
---
You forgot skill.... it wouldn‚Äôt be fair if someone had more skill than them so we have to have an even playing field.
---
I'm a rifle build and carry one of each that you mentioned, and have observed the same pros and cons as you. Having contributed absolutely nothing to the conversation other than letting you know you're not alone in your reasoning, I'm going to sit back and check up on how this thread progresses over time.
---
So the people who play more should be penalized because you don't play as much as they do.   &lt;--Insert leftist joke here --&gt; 
---
Once I get ok... but 4 or 5 times in 10-20 min when you aren‚Äôt returning fire isn‚Äôt ok. 
---
No thanks, I am going to use my current character in survival and change freely back and forth.  I specifically said not ALL of my friends want to play survival.  Some will.  I want to.  
---
Lucky!
---
Most people knew they were buying duped weapons, but hey they got a shiny new weapon and COULD feign ignorance if questioned. They just didn't think about it or care enough to not buy them. 
---
I can almost guarantee some of the weapons I bought were duped, but that's ok. I enjoy them and I've never complained about the dupers.
---
I been saying this since they first talked about it.   This needs to happen for their to be ANY integrity in this game mode
---
I am wondering about the relation between having access to your current gear and PvP having no consequences is and frankly I see none. Could you please explain it to me? I do believe the consequences were the same. You play survival? You'll loose some of your aid items and double the caps if you die, you won't be able to spam-heal, you won't be able to fast travel everywhere so easily.
---
Actually thinking about possible negative consequences of being able to switch modes at will the only one I see is circumventing the fast travel limitations. This could be solved by spawning you in V76 each time you change game modes.
---
Are you all talking about the Fasnacht Man mask? If so, that isn't a drop. It's a static spawn in two locations I know of
---
I got the giant last night on my first go. Does everyone get a mask for completion? 
---
Starting at 0 is only good for you *now*. This is no fix. New players in a year from now will be in the same situation.
---
Unless you want Survival to be on a per session basis?
---
Ive nuked it. But we were still able to complete it. 
---
Honestly slapping ppl isnt even trolling. Im just trying to see who wants to fight. Its a duel challenge. Liken "request duel" in any other game.
---
If you're level 100+ it's pretty much pointless. Trying to level u pa new character in this mode seems like suicide because people could just camp out at places like airport or fire station and snipe you.
---
Oh right.  I guess if the game determines you're really good at pvp, maybe it could limit your bandwidth and cause you more lag ;)
---
I play like 3 hours a day doing nothing but farming legendary enemies. It's hugely random, but I'll find anywhere between 1 and 20 2-3 * items per day. I have like 80 since I started saving them for the legendary vendor a couple weeks ago.
---
It's not hard at all to farm them.
---
I've found a handful that are "good" but just not good for my build. I actually DID have a great one for my last build, but that was before I respecced myself to Bloodied once they gave us the special point change system.
---
It's like how you said, only one person claims to have gotten a rare mask, and that's not verifiable. The same goes for this poll and the data collected. 
---
It's not verifiable. For example, a person claimed to have done the event over 40 times, and it had only been active for a day. With it being 20-25 minutes to run, and only every hour, I doubt with even luck server hoping, they did it 40 times in a about a days time. 
---
Any conclusions made from data that is unverifiable or flawed, isn't worth anything. 
---
The anger over not getting a rare drop, is entitlement. There's clearly anger in this thread, in the OP's statement. 
---
There' nothing logical in your first two questions either. It's just an attempt to get me to agree to some "facts" so you can try and attach my agreement  to something else. Some conclusion that you don't have any facts to support. 
---
Theres a place in Tangara Town theres a video ware u unlock this door and there in there but I went to my armor bench and can make it I'll look in to the pa bench and see what I can find there
---
Does anyone know if they changed this? I've been server hopping and running back and forth for about 30 minutes now and I haven't had anything spawn at all. Good, bad, nothing. 
---
Actually that does sound like the BoS from Fo4...
---
If you are... I think they fixed the spawn, now it's a whole hidden "quest" involving terminals and passcodes and hidden safes
---
If you‚Äôre in power armor a lot or are fighting the queen (in PA) a nice perk set to have is stabilized.
---
The vault raid says it‚Äôs out during nuclear winter so it‚Äôs a wait since that‚Äôs coming out in the summer 
---
Its your duty to server hop. 
---
You are opting out of an experience.. They arent. 
---
Still not harassment until they chase you to a new server. 
---
Would you delete characters per session? Or would the survival character keep his stuff the next day? Because the issue in a year from now will have new players at 0 and with the same exact argument being made now.
---
i think this would be a good alternative to PvP, so that everyone can benefit from the workshop if they lend a hand and help defend it!
---
Yeah they're definitely decent, espicially if you don't want to trade, and are sick of farming. I'm sure as time goes on they'll introduce new perks for weapons and release them as part of exclusive events as well.
---
What's nice is you know what you're getting and get to judge if the quest/event/etc is worth it or not 
---
Dang
---
There still is a SMALL chance of griefing, which is why I refuse to try and claim a workshop, and am exceedingly leery of joining teams blind.  
---
How about a glow in the dark rainbow!
---
Suppressed TSE Minigun sounds even better than the suppressed pump shotgun 
---
BoS are kinda dicks lol 
---
I think it's called leather longcoat. Supposedly drops from dailies in The Mire. I couldn't tell you what it looks like. I'd just started making a point of doing the dailies to try getting some outfits when those quests got unofficially patched out.
---
Ya unless they release it in the atom shop soon otherwise I‚Äôm guessing during the summer 
---
I have survival. I will be able to farm workshops in adventure
---
&gt; For example, if you have pacifist mode disabled and return fire against another player you will become hostile toward them, meaning you will then take full damage from their attacks.
---
Is the development team on crack? The entire point of passive mode is to prevent initiating PvP especially in unintended situations like events and boss fights.
---
Can wait for the stream of complaints when people run in front of the SBQ's face to initiate PvP with everybody and griefs the attempt.
---
Literally stopped reading once I saw you can transfer existing between modes freely. New mode is dead and it hasn't even been released yet lol.
---
I‚Äôll probably spend most of the time in survival, just because it adds that extra level of tension to the game. Makes everything way mire intense. Every building you enter could contain a trap, every train station could be held by hostile players ‚Äì jeez I want to play it now.
---
How late will you guys be launching today smokeyyy? I have to work late and am afraid I won‚Äôt make it to one today :(
---
I agree, just seems weird seeing all the hate but being all quiet on how many got the weapons! lol
---
Side note, I also find it hard to believe that a developer or contractor didn‚Äôt leak the process to dupe out... there ain‚Äôt no way someone accidentally just did that! 
---
That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing 
---
I'm not sure actually. They weight A LOT more than the masks and aren't that great. If they increase storage somehow I think they could be worth a few thousand caps, but nothing to crazy.
---
This please!!!  My streak is starting to show from the outside. 
---
Yep looks like yet another bug.
---
Only way I could picture it is with a guild/clan system. 8+ guys out there working together who will wreck your day if you try to pvp one of them.
---
I‚Äôve actually picked up a three star TSE, if your talking explosive I got a Vampires Explosive, Medics explosive and some more. Not everyone dupes or buys them online.
---
They **have** made great progress to get it to a comfortable release state, but let's be honest it should have been this way from the beginning so that doesnt score too many points from me. Our group did everything short of launching the nuke and we did that from day 1 to the day we quit, which was its own mini game in *"how many times can my playstation crash before I stop for the night"*. I probably wouldn't be as jaded if I had started playing today, regardless of my feelings for the new "pvp" mode.
---
"Hey friend want to play together"  
---
"Yes of course friend, go ahead and join me"  
---
"Oh, you're playing in [gamemode] that I don't have a character in, I guess we cannot play together my friend"
---
I'm sure it isn't really shouldered animation problems and issues.
---
Video settings sorry. So used to it being tied into water quality. Water quality. And try shadow distance down too
---
&gt;window glitch
---
If you have a workbench near a window, players can click the craft button and the animation will glitch them through the wall to put them in front of the bench. Bam. Inside the house without picking a lock.
---
Exactly this. People in here act like they represent the majority of the FO76 community. But that‚Äôs simply not the case. Period.
---
Wait, raider longcoat? Do you mean the Hunters Longcoat? That whatshisface from Far Harbor wears? Or is there an actual raider version of that coat?
---
Take away weapons and armor and have everyone be the same level running around in their underwear fist fighting and people would still complain about certain people having an advantage 
---
I mean to mod a weapon for me. Especially if it was worth something. Up front trading obviously isn't a problem. 
---
I think it's very appropriate for it to be called classic combat Armor after all.
---
this game will be shut down a year from now . Everything is "for now"
---
People can use your workbenches through the window, so the animation of using it will teleport them to inside your CAMP.
---
43 and PC too 
---
You'd be surprised how dedicated game exploiters are. Once they realize what triggers items to dupe, crashing to main menu, they just have to figure out how to replicate that event easily.
---
Agreed. I've been saying this from the start. The "No Cross Over for Survival" is selfish and near-sighted. New players a year from now would demand a reset or just be put off from the idea.
---
A more plausible but just as shitty option would be have Survival Mode be per play session.
---
Your the exception... I farm a lot and it‚Äôs work! I imagine you‚Äôd say the same that it takes a long time and it‚Äôs work. 
---
I have an extra hyperx cloud core headset I would send your way for very cheap if interested. It is basically brand new, still in the box. I got two through a shipping error.
---
Match Making?
---
I really have no problem with the loot being rare.  It's just that when something is so rare that it becomes a unicorn, it's not wrong to ask if this is intended, especially when it's a time-limited event.  If Fasnacht was a permanent addition, it wouldn't matter.
---
I believe one of the methods carried over from Fallout 4, and people were genius to try it on 76 and did so with success. 
---
Cant you just post your pic?
---
You dont have nearly enough disease cleanse for this job. 
---
Lmao get over yourself
---
See, that‚Äôs what I was worried about with this mode. I‚Äôm thinking a fully decked Chameleon set is going to offer loads of advantage in guerrilla PvP, and players will have this from day 1.
---
It‚Äôs one thing if this is properly accrued over time, but in the first hour of launch? No thanks.
---
This is bound to happen with new players in a year from now.
---
I hope me and my boyfriend are like this when we get into our 40‚Äôs. 
---
Please server lock junk and aid to the server it came from. 
---
Problem solved. 
---
I farm the Whitespring Clubhouse for an hour per session, since start - never had a 3 star drop and I'm wondering if I need more luck or something (I have 6 luck).  I get a couple 1 stars each time, once in a very rare while do I get a 2 star - but it's almost always a pole hook or something completely useless worth about a nickel.
---
Does luck help?  Do you server hop?  Am I just farming the wrong place?  Any tips would be very much appreciated.
---
I was ready to defend Bethesda until your post. You pretty much summed it up and now, I too think it should be fresh characters. Good comment man
---
as long as we dont restart at lv 1 every time. i'm all for this!
---
Not saying ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù I know a lot of people do get the drops but no way this many players have gotten drops like this that much. 
---
There are a lot of PvP builds people have, and with the new pacifist change it‚Äôll be impossible to PvP on adventure.
---
I have seen multiple people claiming that old man winter picture is of them.  Funny thing is, none of them can get any other pictures and the picture out there is somewhat grainy and could be photo-shopped.
---
That horse died the same day the servers have seen the first players, when the laag and the bugs came to light too.
---
You can blame the chair all you want, doesn't change the fact that the dead horse in the room is the one attracting the flies.
---
Loads of shops sell limited edition pieces. Clothing, Trainers, Music, Gaming, Furniture ... 
---
Tried it for the first time and got kicked from server near the end :(
---
there is a perk that reduce the negative effects a 75% i think
---
I'm 37 and I play with a dude in his 40's every night.
---
Why would anyone have junk tho? Farm and stash it on adventure
---
Well we'd have to be sure to nerf mutations too in that case ;)
---
That's untrue. I have full sent assassin as well. I run the unyielding with a bloodied hand made, keep myself at full health in the end my extra damage with tank killer wipe sentinel assassin before they kill me any day. 
---
Bounties should still occur. As well as player initiated bounties. That should be deterrent enough.
---
Buying is your biggest thing to blame
---
I appreciate the tech aspect and someone figuring out things like this! Bethesda should hire them! Haha! 
---
Also need mods fit the lmg!
---
Damn. Are there any dailies left in the mire? Cause I might have to give this a try
---
Aww it's not that hard. There's lots of advice online to keep relationships fresh. Best i ever heard though was always treat them like your relationship just started last week. 
---
I have one of these pistols. Does yours do any damage?
---
If people had there way then legendary affects would be gone lol
---
Although not a TSE, the "Action Hero" with the TS and faster fire rate is pretty good. Can see a use for the lever action and fat man as well. But yeah, I'm sure they won't go for exorbant prices given their weight and what's already on the market 
---
That would be really nice 
---
i ussually write them short so you can read them without going to Messages
---
Shared workshops would be awesome. You can edit what you place or the workshop owner can place things. Sort of like how it works on a team without needing to actually team up with people!
---
I'd love wandering the Wastes and improving low-levels workshops with my plans :)
---
If the plan was just to silently add it to the technical data loot pool over time it seems really pithy to have taken away the plan and un-learn it from players that already had it.
---
Not everyone gets the right to have lots of time to play,  i barely get to play but it still only makes sense for fresh characters to be allowed into something with risk involved
---
I‚Äôd like more mods for heavys in general. I do hold out faith that they‚Äôll add mods for guns in the future!
---
i can't way to play this mode with the people that actually want to play it. everyone complaining how they wont play it because of x or y, thank you. we don't want you in survival mode anyway. you'll probably just complain about how you always die and how nothing is fair lol. 
---
i'm super interested in how things will be in pve situations. like after a queen, will it turn into a murder session to see who walks away with EVERYONE'S loot? LOL
---
Merman is the Giant mask, a regular spawn at least on Xbox
---
The risks are more that Adventure though. Are you saying the additional risks are still minor?
---
Yea I mean having lvl 60 suiciders would make me think there would be some better reward but just a thought 
---
Personally the only thing that bugs me is when the object goes green but I still get an error.  If it can't be placed,  keep it red for crying out loud. Certainly not a game breaker, but it's frustrating. 
---
&gt;transfer between Survival and Adventure as often as you like
---
Lame... I've run into enough assassin/sentinel players holding over equipment from the duping days in adventure mode.
---
&gt;When you manage to take down your prey you‚Äôll earn twice as many Caps
---
Cap based pvp suuuuucks... why is this still a thing? I'm over level 200, why should I lose 4 times as many caps as someone level 50 even though the level difference doesn't confer any added benefit?
---
&gt;Additionally, you can only respawn at your C.A.M.P., Vault 76, and Train Stations
---
People are going to camp the shit out of these places.
---
Honestly, I‚Äôd rather earn it with a good fight and challenge! People can buy whatever but that‚Äôs the point I‚Äôm making... people are buying them and the majority were probably duped. 
---
Yah! But the lmg especially needs some tlc
---
Time consuming absolutely, but it's kind of more mindless stuff than what I'd call "work." Maybe more tedious than anything else.
---
I just have a few set routes through high-density enemy areas. More enemies == more chances to be legendary == more chances to be legendary with extra stars.
---
All about quantity over quality haha.
---
Thx, will try this... seems like the way the other keys were to be uncovered/found...
---
I tried that last night, oddly my bloodied opponent was taking no visible damage from my perked melee attacks. At first I thought I was just missing him, but after expending some caps trying to get revenge it was clear he was invulnerable to my attacks so I moved to another server.  Guy had good moves, I have to give him that and obviously decent equipment.  A friend did take him down once with a crit shot, so I am guessing he had some variant of the Assassins gear. 
---
It saddens me that the community is so vicious and hateful! Little do they realize dupping has never stopped and never will. Just look at the competed sales on Ebay, people are making thousands selling duplicated weapons armor etc. Why does Bethesda allow known exploiters / greifers and dupers like BostonGeorge and neinbeast to continue playing without repercussions while people like myself who picked up ammo and nuka drinks at giveaways droped in goodue bags continue to get jerked around... 
---
I don‚Äôt get your point tho, is everyone supposed to make a post about their weapons now? Basically you‚Äôre saying a lot of the people who posted on here that were outspoken against duping also had duped weapons? I‚Äôd like to see your proof of that..
---
Seems like an ignorant post imo, you could easily do a search that would turn this info up but sounds like you have an agenda.
---
I was told that the higher your intelligence the more likely you are to learn mods, this is also effected by anything that add/reduces your INT, so taking mentats then scrapping might help you when scrapping
---
Same. I won‚Äôt seek out fights but I will take part in them. 
---
Bah ha ha, good to see you buddy. Curious if you were part of the re-ban wave or not, truth be told.
---
bruh if they do something stupid u can report them
---
Here‚Äôs a solution: level based matchmaking. How hard is that? 0-10 are lumped together. 10-25, 25-40, 40-55, 55-70, And so on. After level 100 you‚Äôre just put in with everyone else over 100. 
---
If you need XP it might be worth it, otherwise.. probably not.
---
It‚Äôs on PS4...
---
Is that the one with the rocket in the eye? If so, I bought it last night on xbone 
---
It was available last night for sure on xbox
---
For bloodied go with a radium rifle, it doesnt get affected by damage resistant perks, and if you fill them with rads theyll die quicker
---
I hear yeah! I‚Äôm a retired/disabled veteran and this game I can get lost in pretty quick! Ha! 
---
I kind of wish they gave some types of loot bonuses as well. But I'll take what I can get will still be fun
---
The developers know better than the players. Because we're all stupid, or something.
---
I want to see actual screencaps, plus a screencap of the inventory.
---
Never really got why unyielding builds stay low health lol if its a hard enough fight you'll get the benefit once you get to low life and already done a lot of damage
---
I got it on Xbox, I‚Äôm clearing the event with it on. It looks like it still featured you might have to scroll through it some. 
---
I wonder why it vanished. Seems weird to put it on there for only a couple of hours. 
---
I would love to see a diversity from being in a faction, I don't really like that you can just join all of them and makes you not feel special at all.
---
Uhhh okay ill make a post. 
---
I would love to grind all day, I am that nerdy and hardcore but I work 16 hours a day and can only play for maybe 4 hours if I want sleep. I don‚Äôt exactly wanna do the event 300 more times in my only 4 hours off. 
---
I got it on Xbox. Close out of Fallout completely or even reboot the console and try again.  I have to close Fallout to refresh the atom shop sometimes.
---
Me always, but I‚Äôm at work :(
---
But griefers exist in ALL games including ones that don't have pvp, the assholes and malcontent will always find something to bother the average player.
---
I have never had the build to fight back against the griefers who bait you into pvp, like those who will slap you and follow you around/jump in front of your bullets to initiate pvp, them not being able to waste my armor cnd, stims, and repair mats is a huge improvement from how it is.
---
Nothing Bethesda does will get rid of griefers.
---
They will ALWAYS find a way to bother people.
---
If your unhappy with being able to fight back then move to the pvp servers when they drop sounds like they are exactly what you want, unadulterated survival pvp where everyone has a more or less equal chance to be ganked.
---
The challenge weapon system seems dope
---
RemindMe! 1 year
---
The lack of consequence is simply tied to your current PVP state. As many others in here have mentioned, being able to drop in and out of PVP servers allows you to come in, and as soon as you run out of resources it is back to PVE to grind some more, then back to PVP etc... The difference between having to watch your back in a closed PVP environment while you resupply(therefore creating content for yourself, and the person who can engage in PVP with you organically) or hopping back to the safe haven of PVE where you can loot without having to worry, and therefore no consequence. 
---
  For some this may seem to not be an issue, and in that case it sounds like PVE is the right area for them. For PVP, however, it's a simple "no risk, no reward" concept and im struggling to find what incentive there is to stay in the PVP world other than the minor % changes they are giving to caps and XP. Why should I risk losing all the things I looted when I can just hop in between? What reason is there for a person or group to try and clear towns to find people to kill if the vast majority will just loot in PVE? This is all going off of assumptions but I feel they are pretty good ones, and i'm confident that bethesda's internal metrics will show this.
---
Maybe a no limits survival vs. Fresh start survival?
---
Going to kill the app and try again. People have mentioned it being on Xbox last night but I have yet to see it myself. 
---
Sometimes 30 minutes. Also freezing up on first game load.
---
Im on PS4 right now. Chrishale67 is PSN name.
---
Ask your friend to come to Helvetia so i can see it. At least knowinh its possible would be a plus.
---
The Botherhood of Steal.  Spelling is intentional.
---
It's only 'equal footing' until 2-3 days after the release and people without a job have been playing for 70+ hours.
---
The goblin mask is 10 caps. But 1 bobby pin is 14 caps. Make sense.
---

Im just gonna post a pic, believe  it or now my man 
---
There really isn't any "single best", they each have their purpose.
---
The Hunting/BoS rifle is the best for first shot sniping from very long range.  The ammo is plentiful early on, but the higher level areas it gets scarce.  Scrounger perk helps out here, but I still have to make runs to The Forest and farm some .308 occasionally.
---
The Handmade is much better for closing enemies, as it's high fire rate lets you put in VATS hits very quickly to keep things from reaching melee range.  5.56 ammo is scarce in the lower-level areas, but more plentiful in The Mire/Cranberry Bog areas.
---
The Lever Action is best for general-purpose, medium range shooting/sniping.  It reloads quicker than the bolt-actions, and still has good damage.  The ammo is plentiful in-world, so you'll rarely need to craft any, especially with Scrounger perk.
---
The Dragon is best for when you need MAJOR punch, like for Scorchbeasts/SBQ.  Though it's heavy ammo, fast condition drop (only 10 shots at normal full condition to break) , and hideously slow reload make it special purpose.
---
The Gauss Rifle is in a similar spot to The Dragon.  It can have a scope, and benefits from energy weapon perks as well.  And it can have a scope, unlike The Dragon.
---
Max Rifleman, Max Expert Rifleman, Max Master Rifleman, Max Tank Killer, Concentrated Fire, Glow Sights 2 should be your combat load of Perception perks.  That's +60% damage, +36% armor piercing, +9% chance to stagger, VATS targeting, and +40% damage to glowing enemies.  Even with lower Rifleman ranks, you'll still do plenty.
---
Gunsmith rank 5 isn't needed until VERY late in the game, and Gunsmith 3 is a much better option for combat loadout.  It keeps condition from deteriorating too fast, and allows you to do most ballistic mods without issue.  Once you're well past lvl 50, and have the perk cards to spare, have BOTH a rank 5 and a rank 3 Gunsmith to swap between.
---
Max Sneak, Max Covert Operative, Escape Artist, and Mr. Sandman are your Agility perks for combat.
---
Max Bloody Mess in Luck perks gives an easy +15% to all damage.
---
Hardened Receivers are  your friends, or Powerful Automatic ones for Commando builds.
---
Instigating Legendaries are a godsend for snipers.  Always look for rifles that have them.
---
The weight is the big issue with rifles.  I'm currently carrying FOUR (Hunting, Handmade, Lever, Dragon) and it is taking up a LOT of my capacity.  But it gives me flexibility.  And I have my Blade of Bastet should things get TOO close (decent speed and +50 armor pierce).
---
Im 37 (not quite an old fart) but i play almost exclusively with my 71 year old father.  Its so much fun!
---
I reckon you don't because of your post history
---
He didn't say that other people working hard isn't fair, he said the whole "fresh start puts everyone on a level playing field" thing doesn't work after the first week. 
---
And as someone who actually is playing the game (you admitted that you aren't playing it right now, don't try that "I was playing it at launch" bullshit), if they made me start over on survival I wouldn't bother. As would most current players. We've worked on our characters for months, and a junkie's switchblade isn't going to be enough to get me to abandon it.
---
If we get weapon displays people will be all over these ;)
---
Todd Howard deserves to be flogged, tarred and feathered and dragged on a leash through burning embers for even daring releasing even one game I dont like. /s
---
Wow so fun. Maybe you could just go play Division 2
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs the one. In fact I just figured it out. For some reason I had to completely kill the app and not just let it ‚ÄúResume‚Äù after turning my Xbox on again. I‚Äôve since loaded the shop and can see the mask. 
---
I guess they cache the items locally for some reason...
---
Well it sounds like it‚Äôs gonna be more of a beta mode so I‚Äôd submit your feedback directly to Bethesda if this is something you want. I have a hard time not picking up junk so I feel like you‚Äôll still be able to loot what you need from people, and I doubt it will be as bad as you claim but we‚Äôll see.
---
Yeah this isn't actual PVP, more like PVP-lite, or lazy river PVP. we wanted an actual game mode with real consequences, and instead we got....this...
---
Yeah ide get it up as high as possible, I've tested this out on some weapons and I think it may be true because I've gotten a lot more on one character who specializes in Int and I've unlocked almost every mod for weapons, armours are a different story because I think you actually need plans for them which sucks
---
‚ÄúAnti-consumer‚Äù while I agree the things they sent out were of poor quality, they explained why. Most of it was outsourced.
---
This is a little late for PvP exclusivity. Everyone that wants PvP is going to play Rust, Apex, or The Division 2. Bethesda needs to pull the plug and let the 1,000 players die with it.
---
So true. Since they apparently sorted duping I've been a little more open to trading and noticed a few people are walking around with more than a sensible amount of tse/aae etc. Over 1000 hours in and I've still not seen one drop, let alone having 10 to sell.
---
I don't think luck matters, I think I have 8 luck so I can have Bloody Mess for 3, and then both the mutation related ones for 5.
---
I feel like Whitesprings is good for volume of legendaries in general, but not for multiple star drops.
---
I have no idea if this is true or not, but in my personal experience I will get more legendaries overall running Whitesprings than other places, but less in terms of Two or Three Star vs One Star.
---
Also I don't just farm the Clubhouse, I do an entire lap of the whole place, usually barely even bothering with the clubhouse because it's too packed. I wait till most people are done, then I run a lap hitting all the spawn locations. I typically get a 3 star legendary MAYBE ever 3 - 5 sweeps of the entire place. 
---
Farming West-Tek or whatever that super mutant facility is, I'll usually see at least one 2 or 3 star every time I go in there and do a full clear of the building.
---
Farming Watoga, generally I'll see between 2 and 5  multi-star robots in an hour or two of running it.
---
I server hop like a mother fucker. I made a video about it a while ago, but I basically spawn into Watoga, run a lap, then new server.
---
It's random, sometimes I'll get unlucky and see nothing for hours. Other times, I'll have 4 Three-Star enemies in a single run. It averages out over time.
---
That‚Äôll explain why I lag all the time because I don‚Äôt complain about the game lol
---
Only reasonably if there'd be seasonal wipes so new players will have a chance to take part of that even playing field.
---
I'd be totally down if the 'hardcore' character you describe maybe lasts a month or two and is then reverted to a normal character, so you keep it but must start a new one in 'hardcore'.
---
How exactly did you convince an Assaultron to give you head?  Asking for a friend. 
---
PVP has been an ongoing issue for my friends and I teaming up.  Griefers are prevalent when you're mixed/low-level and some high-level asshat gets bored.  Server hopping takes time.
---
good bot
---
My point was clear, if dupers made 100,000k of TSE and flooded the markets as people have stated with them it‚Äôs safe to say many bought duped items and knowingly did so. 
---
I have no ‚Äúagenda‚Äù I see posts complaining about dupers while there are literally more players out there still with duped items... 
---
The posts here show how much of everything was duped. 
---
I appreciate all those that have fought hard and taken the time to get them in drops but that takes time! 
---
Old Longfellow?
---
I‚Äôm selling armor on PS4.  Bulk discounts will apply:
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YQk92jbTX-qXHAYvl7XqXDfZfLvk8V_wmVdb-fOYX2w
---
a friend of mine go rebanned again he has almost 1000 hours playing, he is not a dupper, he just loves launching nukes and killing the queen A LOT!  this is crap what they have done. they did not give a reason for any of this crap!
---
What do you want /r/crowfall ?
---
why should i join something that has rules that are not to my liking and where i can control who is and is not welcome why? that is my question  ps i asked a question and you asked a question in return i wanted an answer not a lecture
---
I get that. I've been playing since day one as well. It's water under the bridge though for me. I purchased the game, went through the same frustration as everyone else, and once the game got better, I just...let it go. I mean, I'm not going to pre-order games from this point forward, and I'll probably wait until they've been out a month before even firing them up, depending on what kind of technical issues they have, but the money is already gone. I can't get a refund, and at this point, I don't want one. The game is fun, I'm getting my money's worth, so there's no point in staying mad about it, for me.
---
I'm not telling you what to do, just how the process has evolved for me.
---
This üëÜ right here. 
---
I want the yellow top VT stash box. It's in screenshots in the store..
---
I just want a windowless room to actually be dark. I hate that the light level in a camp room isn't affected by whether or not I have Windows.
---
Yep that did the trick! Looks like they cache the atom shop inventory locally for some reason. Thank you!
---
I read that the faster you complete the event the more likely you are to get a rare drop. So therefore if you collect the likely items before the event starts you should be able to complete it in record time and have a more likely chance to get a rare drop
---
While I would prefer a fresh start, I actually feel better about this than I did previously, for a few reasons.
---
First, the leader boards. The top three survivors on the server can be seen on the map, as well as wanted players. That's it, and I think it works, because those people with god tier weapons and armor will become giant targets. 
---
Second, the bounty system. Wanker one-shot you? Put on a bounty and either warn others of their location or get others to kill them for you.
---
Third, swapping back. Yes, it will suck to get one shot out there. But you can always come back and farm Adventure. I imagine it as using Survival to get specific goals done, and adventure for screwing around and farming materials.
---
Again, I would vastly prefer a separate fresh character pool, but I personally have no great objection to the system as offered.
---
Man, people really are shitting on free 3* weapons. I play casually and didn't get a ton of duped guns, so these ones are welcome to me.
---
That‚Äôs good, ‚Äúwe‚Äù can go play something else with better PVP
---
Are Reactive Plates not working?
---
In all my hours of playing I've found 2.
---
Because I googled this issue and saw a chance to make an "australian joke" and took it.
---
Turns out it was a coaching issue, which I didn‚Äôt expect. Have to completely close out of the game. Shutting the console off and letting the game ‚ÄúResume‚Äù will show stale items. Thank you!
---
I will give that a try, thanks.  I don't think I have seen and legendary radium rifles, do those exist?
---
Will we be able to switch freely from one mod to another ?
---
I got a 3* rolling pin at WS...lol just think that‚Äôs a funny weapon... also not exploding...lol
---
Do you PvP often? Because if you did you would realize the only thing that 350 means is a lot of caps, for the same challenge as killing anyone else. 
---
Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt try survival at all, wouldn‚Äôt want you to lose everything to someone like me.
---
I don't really have an interest in PvP, but I agree that everyone should start on a level playing field.
---
I think they'll figure this out during the BETA.  Hopefully they learned from the game's initial rollout disaster.  Listen to your player base.  Like being an Uber driver, you may own the car sit in the driver's seat, but you're not going to make any money unless you take passengers where they want to go.
---
Yea, I have an anti armor one
---
Just turned 50. GT is njorls
---
I was at the water feature next to Camp Charlie (I think it's that one). Placed it fine, swapped servers, same message. Re-placed it, built fine, swapped servers, same message. I just chose a different area for now.
---
Lol. Truth
---
That would be a little bit disappointing considering the cap limit.
---
The problem with showing weapons (and the reason it was left out of 4 and 76) is that weapons are much more modular with the new modding system. Weapons can be a lot of different shapes and sizes now, which can lead to a lot of clipping between the weapon and the character.
---
I think people also forget levels between players get compressed to even the playing field. The only difference is the legendary effects that get brought along.
---
Ok, well, that's how it should be imo. Legendary regular armor makes power armor obsolete in PvP. Why one and not the other?
---
What valuable insight, thank you!
---
Yeah it seams the sloth which only appears 50% of the time will just get frozen about 70% of the time and it sucks but I think it's because of how many people are shooting at it and gets stuck trying to process everything.
---
You could run a RNG a million times and get nothing. But another guy could get it 1st time.
---
If weve run 6k and got nothing, statisticly the chance is less than 1/6000. Thats for 1, there are 5. So that would take 30,000. That is too rare. Computers are calculators, they dont care. They just run numbers. If it is THAT rare, it is nonexistant.
---
Nah, we could still keep Stalkers.  Only on melee though.  
---
If you have Nvidia in it's Nvidia Experience you can set it up to record the last 5 mins (it's adjustable) when you hit Shift-F10.
---
Things in this game have always been rare with a super low drop rate, just with all the duping on every item no-one notices how rare what they have was intended since it seems so common on the market subs
---
As long as they aren't rad raisin cookies. Yuck.
---
Only the noob pvp‚Äôers. I‚Äôll be the guy taking them all out with 1 vats crit each while they sit and wonder how they got 1 shotted through full sentinel assassin.
---
Wife and I are both 39. Friend of ours is 37.  I'm surprised at how few children I run into. I imagine they're all playing fortnite or apex or something.
---
Oh snap you're right, that's a reading comprehension fail on my part.
---
Yes, but I didn't know yet it was a problem with unitymedia.. but in retrospective it suddenly seems so obvious...
---
I have a 3* one shot explosive handmade that was dropped by a legendary at harpers ferry. No duping.
---
Yeah idk people are not easily wooed I guess. But I really didn't care for survival before and now I'm really interested to play for the unique challenges and weapons.
---
And again, they're guruanteed drops! No grinding Whitesprings or West tek in hopes you get something decent 
---
It's the only fair way for players in the future, like a year from now. Unless you want players to delete per session.
---
Only one for me and it was a Dragon, don‚Äôt think it was a 3* either...
---
Sweet.  
---
God roll legendary items might actually be balanced if they were limited in the game world as intended instead of being duped into grossly unbalancing the game
---
so you like swinging an epeen huh?  pretty sad flex man
---
insecure much in real life? problems at home? small hands?
---
its ok, you can pay people to love you for the right price by the hour
---
Yeah it's pretty cool. Not the strongest but sets things on fire and free laser light show üëçüëçüëç
---
 I agree, full stop.
---
I see the reasoning behind this move though (maybe not Beth's reasoning, but still).  If you come into the game late (or decide to participate in PvP late), even if the PvP server was locked-in, any new player would be at a *HUGE* disadvantage.  Why would I participate in a PvP server if 90% of the people there were 3 months or more ahead of me in progression?  I'd just be target practice.  I know I wouldn't bother (but I don't PvP anyway, so YMMV).
---
All I care is that they're taking PvP out of the servers I play on.  What those other servers look like, I could personally care less, as I won't be there.
---
Yes, I accidentally on purpose shot someone's camp they set up at the event and got wanted and people had no problem killing me for the 10 caps.
---
You must be bad at pvp if you think that‚Äôs what good pvp‚Äôers do lmao.
---
Lemme guess...  you want to farm in adventure, and bring the spoils over to survival, right?
---
True story.  It's like some people cherrypick buzzwords and morph a sentence into what they want to hear for the sake of creating conflict.  There's several replies to my comments like that, so I just stopped feeding the fire.
---
I‚Äôll check it out. 
---
If you've maxed your character limit are you supposed to then delete one to do survival?
---
&gt;Trade item for item, not just item for caps.
---
&gt;Currently, trading item for item requires a certain amount of trust that the other party will cooperate. Let's just make it so that the trade happens instantly with no trust required.
---
This can kina be mitigated if you both set the item price in the trade window to the same thing, lets say 3,000 caps.  This way, no one is operating in bad faith, and if they do cut and run, you still got something.
---
But shooting camps no longer makes you wanted, right? Did you actually destroy a piece of the camp?
---
Agreed. The only difference is that everything else was a constantly changing number. This is the first limited time rare drop we've ever seen. There will be a set amount of these masks that can never change until next years fastnacht
---
Yep, been loading up from the ticks at Moonshiner's Shack and the mill for ages to fill out my Stimpak supply, makes a great pair with the Chemist perk.
---
Lol post history aside, that's how you show you lost the conversation. Same level as correcting someone's spelling. 
---
I don't see why not...
---
You‚Äôre not supposed to get them all. They said you you‚Äôll have to trade to get the ones you want 
---
The number of people saying that .03% drop on a one week only event that you can't really do on repeat quickly is an alright percentage is pathetic.
---
If this was a .03 on a quest you could do anytime, as much as you want and it never had an end date sure that would be entirely different.
---
Ive been doing that already. I have wood, wax, steins, and intestines before it starts. You have to wait for eggs. There is only 1 perma egg pile in the river, and ive already hit it.
---
Nah I couldn‚Äôt see people on the map. It was the temporary event team. Not and actual team.
---
Not to mention the fast travel. What is stopping me from fast traveling out of a conflict? I think respawning at these locations is fine. Fast travel needs to be taken out all together
---
Heck yeah! I'd would love to test this, get to see the results myself!
---
I'll be on around 3:00 PM(EDT) and will be on for pretty much the rest of the day. What time would you be good to start?
---
You are so narrow minded... I bet around half of the banned users just accumulated over 100k but doesn‚Äôt mean to say they are ‚ÄúDuPeR sCuM‚Äù as you make out. People pick up bags or are given shit and take it without realising they are now handling illicit goods that would get them banned - it‚Äôs unfair to simply perma ban and chastise many users over Bethesda failing to patch out duping, duped items and such. 
---
Get off your high horse and stop white knighting
---
It‚Äôs almost like it‚Äôs going to get horribly abused or something...
---
I‚Äôm not sure how I learned it, I‚Äôve known it forever. You can also find the mods on vendors occasionally 
---
That would mean a duper would have to be one of the very lucky few. Chances are 99.9% of us will never  even see one in game, dupers included.
---
This community is so small compared to how many people actually own this game. 
---
I‚Äôll log on now. It‚Äôs not gonna be a screen shot, just a mobile pic
---
Reflex sights, especially.  It's a holographic projection.  
---
Invisibility doesn't exist in the real world, so it's impossible to have a credible debate on what should and shouldn't work, but for the sake of gameplay I'd like to have a point of aim instead of relying on a general area of hipfire.  I like headshots.
---
Thanks, I'll check it out. When are you usually online? I'll be on shortly and again after 2am EST.
---
Yes. Level 3 Class Freak, but the card isn't available until lvl 46 or 47. Some people don't care though and go all in before that. I'm weak enough as it is, so I'm waiting. üôÇ Though I might go ahead and take speed demon since I'm running cannibal, lvl 3 lead belly and Carnivore. It's easier to eat and drink with these.
---
Use overdrive too!
---
... oh. That explains a lot. 
---
Bethesda would have thought about this already. Players used to do similar things in Fallout 3 and New Vegas where they would up the difficulty setting for easy tasks like speech challenges then put the difficulty down again. 
---
I agree with you about their continued existence in the game, which is actually why I am kind of opposed to coding hours that could have been used on content getting spent on trying to code griefers out of the game.
---
Unlike your experience I have been able to organise and fight back in the current system however. 
---
If I am unhappy with anything it is with bethesda changing the vision statement of the game with these changes and wasting coding time on something that doesn't actually fix a perceived problem. 
---
I do plan on playing survival, but I am seriously not happy with the way they are doing that either as you can jump between modes and use your existing character, which makes leveling under those conditions extremely difficult.
---
Cool
---
I don't think I destroyed it.   Maybe I did.   It was the Pipboy cardboard or something by it's stairs.   I shot it with my hunter rifle (like 97 damage).
---
And have a new faction of rotting feral raiders spawn at the end... the LepreKhans.
---
Has this been confirmed? I only see a mention of a player generated bounty. No mention of it being the *only* bounty. Could it be an additional bounty on top of the system generated bounty?
---
Weve gotten the time down to under 15min. You can only make the protectrons walk so fast. (Ive been chasing them w/sword like a cattle prod)
---
Dang. How did you get so many? Did you have to go to the bunker and back??
---
Group based vault raids are coming in the summer.  I hope they'll have some more time limited events like this one, though, where the whole server could show up regardless level. 
---
Is there a discord server designed for this?
---
That‚Äôs me too. I‚Äôm overloaded with stimpacks. 
---
Now I go around Flatwoods, and drop off survival starter kits. 
---
In mailboxes I place a stimpack, purified water, rad x, radaway. If someone hits up all the mailboxes they get quite a bit 
---
If there were significantly less of those items then the chance of actually running into people with a full set would be extremely low, or at best several people might have one or two of those items. 
---
I mentioned above...It should be removed all together. The only real reason I am afraid to die in DAYZ is because of all the real world time it took me to walk to where I was
---
Yeah and making a 10 paragraph novel starting with ‚ÄúWelp, look like that‚Äôs it for me then bitching about  quitting Fallout 76 because they didn‚Äôt tailor the game to your wishes is definitely valuable for everyone to hear. Oh wait you don‚Äôt even play the game, you just ‚Äúkeep up with it‚Äù. So that makes your bitching even less valuable than I thought before. I really didn‚Äôt think that was possible. Lol you came here to bitch about  a game you don‚Äôt even play.
---
Well damn,  now if people want to grief they‚Äôll have to actually put effort into it.
---
So what do you mean by ‚Äúseems weird seeing all the hate but being quiet on how many got the weapons‚Äù? That seems to imply that people that are critical of duping are actually duper‚Äôs themselves or knowingly bought duped items. Just seems like a false premise to me with no real evidence to back it up. 
---
‚ÄúI see posts complaining about duper‚Äôs while there are literally more players out there with duped items‚Äù 
---
-yeah that‚Äôs the point and the reason why they‚Äôre complaining because duping sucks, what are you trying to prove with that statement? 
---
you can add another 5 people to that list, we won't come back until its a fresh start
---
Coop pve Wow fun. Maybe you could just go play borderlands 2
---
At work now. I can hop on between 5pm and 9pm EST today. 
---
I agree. I'm happy you can go back and forth.
---
the crazy thing is, every event on the map COULD be like this but nobody does them. the rewards of this event bring everyone in the server together. If you like the pve aspect and interaction this event brings, do more events. i do events all day long and noone ever shows up. it's a bummer, because every event could feel exactly like this one if everyone just showed up.
---
I enjoy the game too but letting them off the hook for releasing a nearly unplayable game just encourages them to do it again. People do the same thing with EA. 
---
There is the fallout network discord that you can access via the reddit sidebar
---
Prime example of why they should have required survival only characters. This will ruin the experience of people who want the PvP element. 
---
How rare IS the beret? I got it on the first or second time and didn't even notice it at first. (I kept it of course LOL, not gonna trash that). I just didn't realize it was rare ?
---
Think longer term.  If I decided to play in PvP (either as a new player, or just a new PvPer), but the servers have been around for months, that means everyone else on the server (90% at least) will all be over level 50, well geared, and my level 1 character would just be cannon fodder.
---
At least, if I can level up before I started trying to PvP, I'd stand a slightly better chance.  I can't imagine a wore PvP starting experience than being 1-shot by anyone on the server over level 20 that felt like getting their jollies that day by killing noobs.
---
Unitymedia user here, i stopped playing the game months ago because of this bullshit.
---
 That does not balance them.  They would still be OP
---
OG
---
My experience has been that dupers don't roll the stuff they dupe, they make huge trade offers that regular players can't compete with. "I'll give you full sets of every armour and 20 different explosive weapons"
---
Often they'll pay real money too, because they dupe and sell on ebay and get that money back quickly. 
---
I really do like the rest of the game, but the endgame is just so bad
---
I would prefer something a bit more in the middle.  Maybe reduced(Slap) damage to bases.  I would also prefer slap damage to be a fixed 1% of total hp.  Still a very small amount but you would still be able to kill some idiot standing in trade at a vendor when they go AFK.
---
Okay school me then? Literally meta right now is sentinel gear.
---
I was thinking of the same thing! And this could have an expansion with a Chinese Faction!
---
Would the PvP work like Survival? Where it's a server based rule? Or like the PvP events in the base game? Where it's only during that limited time?
---
I‚Äôve gotten high voltage hefe, red river ale, pickaxe Pilsner, blood tic margarita, blood tic tequila sunrise,no tequila yet lol.
---
I thought this was their response to dupers. Make it so rare there‚Äôs almost no chance they‚Äôll get one. 
---
So, you want to force me to start a new character while I invested a lot of time in my current one? No way, it's Bethesda's fault that the pvp mode wasn't available on launch and I shouldn't get punished because a newbie wants a fair chance in fights.
---
It's a post-apocalyptic wasteland that's meant to have cruelty.
---
Glad to know at 33 I'm not yet considered an old fart.  I better enjoy the next few years left in my youth...

Im lazy follow this link to tue fb post about it 
---
Definitely destroyed it then. The cutouts go down to 1-2 hits from molerats. I used to have them on the ground but after the molerat infestation I had to raise them to higher ground.
---
Sounds like you need some more sleep, just saying.
---
True, hadn't thought about the trading.
---
I wasnt really saying the bans are permanent. Even if they decided to try an make them permanent, there would be a lot of people trying to get their money back, and probably could, considering the email did say temporary suspension. And i didnt know some people didnt get rebanned, all ive ever seen is people saying that they were. Its nice to see that not everyone was, gives me hope. (I was suspended, and was never reinstated. Still waiting for my day to come back)
---
You've got me beat by 2 years.
---
Did you make sure to check your plans/recipes in notes? It gives you those sometimes.
---
There‚Äôs already a strategy. Chameleon armor camp WS, sneak attack. Park your teammates with similar armor at the WS Train station, farm people spawning in or going to these two places.
---
What is survival? I cant find any information. 
---
Sounds like you need to get a life. You‚Äôre bitching about a game you don‚Äôt even play lmao
---
Reddit is a sample size of the community.  Not everyone on this sub is in 100% agreement on everything.  There are a wide range of opinions here.  You're just focusing on the ones you disagree with.
---
That being said I agree that we should be able to move characters between modes.  I don't know how much I feel like grinding another character up after spending so much time getting mine where I like him. Letting people swap will encourage more players to try it out.
---
Lol...I say let's not nerf anything
---
Oh you're 100% right! You can set bounties I forgot. 
---
If the rare masks are dropping as intended I won't be trading one if I get one. lol
---
Great idea, I would love that too!
---
I'm not sure how I feel about players jumping over to the Survival servers, gaining XP at +20%, earning exclusive legendaries and higher cap rewards, then being able to come back to Adventure mode with those same characters. Maybe it doesn't matter, but for some reason I still think I'd rather that be a one-way trip for a character.
---
I absolutely agree. People in here sure like to act like they are speaking for the whole community but this sub consists of the ‚Äúelite‚Äù, who can spend countless hours in the game and don‚Äôt have a problem with leveling up the 10th character to 100. The fresh-start-bullshit is obsolete after 2-3 days into survival mode. Cause that‚Äôd be the timeframe after which we‚Äôd se the exact loadouts we have in adventure mode. 
---
Lots of good points here! People love to hate on the ol‚Äô interwebs. I never understood all the negativity myself but I think I developed a thick skin a long time ago from the game breaking glitches of Skyrim and the infuriating lag issues from battle.net diablo games. I haven‚Äôt had nearly the problems with Fo76 as with those. 
---
I am really happy I can use my current character in survival 
---
I couldnt disagree more. Why should i be punished for grinding my PvP gear  
---
Bethesda dont listen to these people. Their argument is flawed. There will always be better players. I like what you did. Keep to it.
---
Tl:Dr some fasnacht masks are basically like legendary 3 star drops and barely anyone has them
---
Frankly, it kind of amazes me that players can still get excited about anything EA does.
---
yeah they have already stated in roadmap its coming and alot may not be interested in pvp as you say, but the boards are full of i hate pvp/pvp broken we need actual pvp.  
---
so i think they went in the right direction fixing pvp making both sides of the camp happy before going to work on endgame content. give the pvpers what they want, get the pve people off the boards complainin about being griefed and then go to work on endgame stuff, i think that roadmap was the right way to go honestly.
---
But they haven't even said the normal bounties are being removed. Only the option for revenge being removed and how spawning works.
---
They should allow mode switching just once per week or month or something.
---
Keep those great ideas coming, you are a great contribution and totally not toxic at all!
---
No...no it won't. Transfer them to a new character before you hit the quest, or you'll end up with only one.
---
If they are dropping prove it. I love fallout but this is rediculas I have 3 other friends I play with we have done the event 50+ times not once got any of those 5 mask. I sorry I know they are rare but 4 people doing even 50+ at least get 1 rare mask. 
---
Thanks a ton for all this info!!! You're doing God's work, champ.
---
Now my question (or two) is...
---
Why have I only seen the MUSICIAN robot with the skull face mask ONCE and is that tied to anything rare or ???
---
Also I happened to show up to one other event too late and there was a dead protection called the "Insult Bot" and I wanted to know if that is related to the event or if it was just an unfortunate chance encounter that ended with that guy's demise? lol.
---
Thanks !!!
---
We are in agreement.  I want them to make other effects, particularly berserker and junkies, better instead.  
---
How is this seriously a thing that bethesda is considering?  in what world would that make any fucking sense
---
Yeah that sounds great except I'm not stepping into this PVP world with a level 1 while level 300s who duped and exploited Whitesprings get to keep everything and use it against me.
---
Lol as if this was the first time Bethesda released a super buggy almost unplayable game. 
---
39, PS4
---
I know you can get attacked before fully loading in now.  Its happened a few times since the event started.  I think it may be because of everyone server hoping and putting strain on the servers.
---
I spent ~3 days (not very long ones, but still) hopping servers before I got the coat.  Probably 15-20 vendors before the coat was in stock.
---
I'd say afterwhile the event becomes easier, knowing where the enemies are gonna ambush, and at least all the non-rares are dropping, just now to see if the rare ones will...
---
Are bounties a thing in this mode?
---
If so, you‚Äôre gonna have so much wanted cheese.
---
Shotgun crit builds are pretty solid.
---
i just stand with them haha
---
It makes me chuckle when I get out of power armor and imagine putting it in my pocket. Or asshole.
---
I'm 58 and have played games all my life 
---
Adventure mode? Fast travel
---
Survival mode? Vertibots or army APCs
---
I saw the weather system for the first time from up high today. Sure, I‚Äôve been in the rain, but I‚Äôve never watched the clouds in the distance rain down. Looked amazing. But, it sure would be nice to see a rainbow!
---
Only if it's a Zamboni and I can cripple their legs first, then chase them on the Zamboni while they crawl away :-)
---
It's not going to be 20% faster if everything takes longer due to fast travel and PVP.
---
Your fresh start would last 2 weeks, then anyone wanting to start PvP would be in the same boat, undergeared and unprepared for PvP.
---
There isn't a clean solution for this, but as long as it moves all PvP to another server, it's fine in my book.
---
Yeah, I noticed this too.
---
I have found one set that routinely spawns 50% or better fusion cores since that hotfix, but I'm not telling anyone where it is.  I don't want it nerfed too.
---
Why? So you can play, build up *your* weapons, and dunk on new players in a year from now?
---
New players now is selfish idea and only works for you *now*.
---
I saw a person wearing a goblin mask right after the event was released, I'm fairly certain goblin masks aren't that rare; seen a few since then.
---
I absolutely love this game too and I will forever be grateful for allowing me to enjoy the fallout franchise in a cool way with my friends.
---
That said there has been some pretty unforgivable decision making from the company as a whole and this game was absolutely not ready on release, so it is kind of a mixed bag.
---
I mean I have friends that can't even log in right now and I had an entire two patch stretch where the game became unplayable due to constant crashes to desktop.
---
I guess what I am saying here is I totally dig the OP message but they still have some serious issues and they need to be addressed by Bethesda to deserve this kind of praise.
---
That and Bethesda just switched up the whole vision of what the game was sold as in the latest news.
---
Funny story, I was playing for at least 8 hours yesterday, after about 5 hours I got disconnected from the server so I jumped onto a new one. Wanna know how many events went on in those 8 hours? 0... there were no fasnacht events in at least 8 hours of playing. Safe to say I was fairly annoyed.
---
Well the problem with them releasing the game isn‚Äôt the employees fault, it‚Äôs the owners fault, what happens is shit rolls down hill.
---
The owner will pressure the president, who pressures the Vice President, until it gets to the employees. Guess who‚Äôs reading reddit? The employees not the higher ups, so it‚Äôs just unfair misdirected hate. I‚Äôm certain there‚Äôs a much better way then chewing there ass out, like positive reinforcement.
---
As a team lead I have expectations because my boss has expectations for me. I must make sure we maintain production and keep the guys morale up. They say a happy employee will work harder, so what do I do? I order pizza when we did a big job in record time, I reinforce good behaviour.
---
As far as the toxicity goes, it‚Äôs too much; I feel solid criticism is more effective as insults and swears. 
---
Are you on PC? Lots of use are seeing high memory usage. Four to six gigs, sometimes more. There have been times upon initial world load that ram is absolutely pegged, causing a small client microcrash before it catches back up. Since this patch I feel like there have been a lot more persistent crashes.
---
Not now I'm the same age lol... woot woot 
---
Try a vpn then :) worked for me! 
---
i hardly see 76 as "a nearly unplayable game" other than the server disconnect issues
---
i thoroughly enjoy my time in the wasteland
---
Bullshit hahahah. I never duped once and got banned for having over 100k rare items so stop talking out your ass Lord WhiteKnight of Bethesda-land.
---
In a few words...log out with creeps like that
---
XD I hail enemies with my LMG, things are actually useful now!
---
I will be completely honest.  My character has full marine armor.  The notable legendary effects are the 50% auto stim chance and the chameleon perk.  Then I have a hunting rifle (normal) and All Rise.  I usually use the hunting rifle.  I am level 112~ and I am 50 levels higher than any of my friends. My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
---
Better than trolling players by destroying their bases. That is level 10 retard activity. Only for the true mouth breathers
---
I'm not interested in pvp, and have no desire to use invisibility as an advantage in that situation.  What I would like is to be able to participate in Scorched Earth, post up on top of a sniping position, become concealed and still use my reflex dot to pick at the queen while she's flying.
---
I don't have chameleon mutation.  I have a chameleon/luck/harder-to-detect-while-sneaking metal leg that I'd like to get some use out of, but the reliance on hip fire is frustrating.  It's just sitting in my stash.
---
I'm fine with the downside of a cloaking device as being forced into hipfire accuracy if one of the devs specifically says that it's working as intended.  To me, it feels like an oversight.
---
I could see that working, but what happens when I claim a bunch of workshops and get really into a session and "level out" of a server? Would it force a disconnect and start over at the bottom of a different level appropriate server? Or would there be some sort of session protected exception until I get off? Especially early on, I've burned through like 7 or 8 levels pretty quick without trying very hard. Neat idea though, has potential. 
---
It reality, it is fresh for however long the game has been out (100+ days?) to catch up to current characters. 
---
I think the best option is to allow for new characters to segment themselves as survival only "hard core" characters that are matched only with other "hard core" characters. Let current characters play with other current characters and toggle between the two modes, but let those of us who want a fresh survival only experience be matched together. 
---
It's funny how the 2 Atom Shop masks happen to be reskins of 2 of the rare masks.
---
"Old Man Summer" is just a Red &amp; Black repaint of the "Winter Man" Mask with different eyes
---
"Moonshine Mama" is just a blue version of the "Sun" mask without the Sun Ray frills and a missile in the eye.
---
It only saves the previous 5 mins of play time when you hit the key.   
---
And yes it does mean it's recording all the time (graphics card memory only) and I haven't ever really seen any performance hit with it.
---
i dont know, going by another company doing something similar, diablo 2 &amp; 3 do leaderboards and server wipes so if you want to do stuff on the leaderboard servers you have to start fresh every single time, and its worked for them for years.   
---
dont have a horse in this show since i wont be one going into adventure mode since i really have no interest in pvp. but from past games ive played common thing involving leaderboards is to lock it out to fresh characters only.
---
I agree, after a couple of weeks, survival only characters would be the same level, so literally no point.
---
No, that comes from the wandering responder vendor that you'll never see because some twat always has a camp in his spot. There's a couple of raider outfits that have a super rare drop rate from doing mire dailies. If you can do mire dailies.  The VTU outfit was a rare drop from one of the forest dailies before they put it in the world. The matching hat is still quest only though.
---
Who are you calling an old fart!?
---
Get off my lawn, you damn hooligan!
---
I only log out of FO76 to watch Wheel of Fortune.
---
Back in my day, video games were side-scrolling!
---
Supper is at 5pm, Wheel of Fortune at 5:30pm and bedtime is at 8pm.
---
Damn hippies crying about slap damage!
---
Please tell me you're referencing [this deleted post](https://imgur.com/ifpSA90)
---
I like 76, it's not about personal preference. The fact it's a different direction than previous installments has no bearing on my opinion of it.
---
The numerous lies, poor communication and  shocking lack of customer support however are objectively points against them. As is the horrendous technical performance and mismanagement of 76 in all regards.
---
Your reply to my original comment is not really warrented and is in no way in keeping with the tone I wrote in.
---
So you know, fuck off. 
---
PVE challenges should be available in both modes. Those extra challenges for survival are carrots to chase for the extra difficulty while in survival mode.
---
My wife was having her period I showed her this post and she's bone dry again. Thank you.
---
As someone who‚Äôs done the event with 41 luck every time, I can confidently say luck has no effect on the drops.
---
It's a good plan üòÇ catch them with hard proof
---
50. GT MadCowl. Lvl82 Would welcome some company. 
---
No it implies that there is literally thousands of duped weapons out there and posts by seasoned players having received only a few drops playing for hours. 
---
I‚Äôm not complaining at all, it‚Äôs an observation. Simple as that. 
---
" anyone who doesn't agree with my idea or the way I think the game should be played should just shut up or leave" Do you really think I am the only person that is waiting in the rafters for this game to get better? sorry i'm not such a glutton for punishment? You can keep coming back with the"UR NOT PLAYIN REEE" but it doesn't lessen my argument, or strengthen yours. You don't like what I have to say? come up with something better, or learn how to have a constructive argument that isn't about quieting others. You aren't going to silence me with your stupid kid-level argumentative skills.
---
No?  Just generically using an innuendo.
---
How would it? They don't plan on staying the server for more than 10 mins.
---
From what i heard radiation negates armor effects mostly 
---
There are hundreds if not thousands of duped sentinel + assassin's sets out there, none of which were ever removed unless a person had multiple copies on them at once. Those people will be literally invincible lmfao. Good luck getting to the leaderboards without being a filthy cheater
---
I have an aae combat shotgun and with enforcer it does alright but honestly I feel like it's missing power others have. I have all the shotgun dmg perks. Feel like if a player is on equal ground it's a 50/50 shot which sucks because when I lose its 1/7th of my vendor caps profit for the day. 
---
Nah. My high horse has kept me from being banned, I think I'll keep riding.
---
Or we can have Hardcore-Survival where if you die, you lose everything you are carying like in DayZ or Rust.
---
That is what i'm waiting for !
---
The PVE people are still going to complain about being griefer when they get ganked because the only thing changing is slap damage. PVP will still be a very large part of adventure mode through workshops and versus zones.
---
another great idea!  i guess the issue would be, what happens when you level up within the server past your level range? would the game auto close and released into the next tiered world level?
---
not at all criticizing, only want to help further flesh out this idea, as i think its a good one
---
You can try but they're all bugged to shit right now. At present for me there's about 2 or 3 dailies that will start. I can't remember the last time a mire one worked, they've been broke for a few patches now. Different people report different dailies working/not working so no harm trying.
---
Explain your logic please
---
Not a clan or guild but you're more than welcome to play with me whenever. I joined a week or two ago, level 25. GT is same as reddit. 
---
Block him and change servers. Pretty much all you can do when you're that low level
---
If I‚Äôm playing with the intention of pvping/roleplaying as a raider and the second I shoot someone they disappear it will ruin my experience. Not sure how you think it won‚Äôt. 
---
I would be trying to get nerd rage, its pretty decent even on non bloodied builds
---
i have been looking for a fix for a while but i think there just isn't going to be a solution. the issue is not the  bench, materials ect it seems the issue is the broken ID itself and because its a quest item you cant drop or equip it therefor i cannot conceive of a way to fix this. would appreciate  if anyone finds the fix to say because other quest items may bug in the future
---
I also have to be ocmpletely honest, I think the new decisions by ebthsoft are very interesting. Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
What's a level playing field? And for who? What about new players a year from now?
---
Listening to a player base isn't always good. For bugs? Sure. For design decisions? This is their game. I'm not telling my doctor how to sew an artery. I will tell him when and what hurts though.
---
Literally solves all issues bar twinking low characters with 3* legendaries. I‚Äôd go so far as to put it into 5-10 level bands, sine perk packs up to 50 can make a huge difference. After 50 the bands probably need to be a little wider, but with legendary characters on the horizon, crazy high levels should thin out a little. 
---
I like that I can put a few builds together now to try in a PvP environment. Especially excited to try my sniper. I fully intend to fight the good fight - defend people levelling up from those that would cause them harm. 
---
As long as there‚Äôs a fairly equal amount of ‚Äònormal‚Äô high level players mixed in with the lowbie trolling asshats, we should be fine. 
---
Attaching a few challenges to levelling a character solely in survival and adding bonuses to characters ‚Äòlocked‚Äô to survival (like faster exp gain, leading to faster access to ‚Äòlegendary‚Äô characters and rewarding the higher risk). 
---
The only way I can really see this going south is if they add higher tier gear that is -only- available in survival, because that‚Äôs gonna make survival the endgame rather than a different mode.
---
Oddly the best drops I've gotten weapon wise have all come from three star  dogs, crickets, and other normally garbage creatures.   If you are in the queen event and see a three star dog or cricket make sure you tag it.
---
Yeah I server hop to buy stealthboys as well, so I do both at the same time.
---
It's a pun on the word "bug". The image is of a BUG from fallout saying "we're all just jolly good sir". The joke is that "the BUGS don't need fixed, look at this BUG (in the other sense of the word), he says he's doing fine"
---
Thanks for the tip. I'll try it out. There've been so many times where I've been like 'did that just happen' and wished I was recording.
---
I understand the survival mode is going to be a new thing in Fallout 76 but what is the more concerned that people should really be wary of are players using legendary two shots explosive weapons and not to mention overpowered melee builds. 
---
One good thing that could come out of survival mode is that it can actually take these stats during PVP in a new survival mode and collected data to improve and adjust this type of weapons to make them balance and fair against other players.
---
I tried to tame mole miners and mire lurks last night w wasteland whisperer rnk 3 and i pacified a lot of them but never saw the pacify option.  On the mire lurk Kings and queens there was no pacify option. I guess i am gonna have to try and rank up animal friend and tame something
---
As this is posted on Reddit should Bethesda read or ignore it?
---
Basically, if your workbenches or other ineract-able objects are near a window, someone can press up against the window from outside until they get the prompt to use it. When the use it, the game does the animation to put them in front of the bench. Now they're inside without having to pick your lock.
---
People bought new accounts just to have infinite mules for all their duped god tiers. Do you think they won't make lower level alts and transfer the cheated gear there?
---
Runs fine on original Xbox one. Note that you will get fps lag under 15 sometimes in intense combat, but not often. 
---
I won't be available during that time frame today but I'm off tomorrow so maybe we'll the able to meet up some time Friday. I'll drop you a line if I find anything that interests me in your list.
---
So, can we delete your survival character every couple months so that the "fresh characters" thing keeps applying to new players?
---
i just think ppl love to complain..especially gamers..like they are part of this niche elite professional gaming community..and they are entitled (no on actually gives a fuck) ..ever since RD ive been playing this game constantly..most the time i have to force myself to stop playing..this is actually the first online game i ever played and made a bunch of friends all around the world..the market subs for this game is great too..ppl who have sold me outfits/serums/etc im constantly sending ppl their way
---
Oh also ditch critical savvy and take serendipity, its way too good in pvp
---
I'd love to see someone drop an orbital strike grenade vis the last laugh perk after death there...
---
Could you post the source link next time 
---
I like killing workshop owners across the map. 
---
I usually announce my presence and intent via mic chat when im close. 
---
I am here to kill you. Prepare for battle! *my buddy tags the workshop initiating PvP*
---
Burn the duper(s)! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! BURN HIM!
---
The game is very different now than it was months ago when it launched. So many bug, exploit, and balance fixes have gone in to the game. It is still a better situation to have new players who start two weeks from now only be "two weeks behind" rather than 4 months behind. I do see your point though, after a year, it won't matter as much, but it still does matter very much right now. 
---
The best option I see is to let new characters opt in to be "hard core" survival only characters that are matched with other characters that are the same. This lets current players enjoy the new mode and bounce between modes, while lets folks like me (and OP) play a survival only experience where everyone earned their characters and levels through the unique challenge that survival mode offers. 
---
I support letting players have this one more additional option of survival mode only characters and letting current characters enjoy the new mode too!
---
Bookmark [this](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/) site. Scroll down a bit for the news.
---
OOF that sucks for P.A. users then..... but at least I wasn't imagining things! LOL
---
The witch mask looks like a goblin if you‚Äôre confused. 
---
Fast travel. Being nearly all the vehicles are nuclear powered. And haven‚Äôt been used in a number of years. They probably would explode if started them up. 
---
The real question to ask if who are we paying caps to when fast traveling?
---
Tbh I'm sick of casual players like this OP trying to ruin the fun of the players who have spent hours farming caps grinding the markets and obtaining good gear spending months prepping for this PvP mode.  I know this isn't going to be popular but literally of your arguments are invalid and I will explain why. 
---
You are saying that you want everyone to start on even footing so you have a chance in PvP mode. That's the thing this fix is temperory the more serious players like myself will spend more hours we know how to build better than you we know how to PvP better than you. Literally all this will do is one piss the serious players off then give you a couple months at most where you will have a chance but then we get in more and more ahead of you because you have no chance of catching up because you play 1 hour per day at most and do nothing efficiently.Not only that what about the players that pick up the game in a couple of months, do you think they will have a chance against you with thier level 10 characters running around the map or should we just reset the game everytime new players join. No they don't literally all your suggestion does is waste peoples time redoing what they have already done. You literally need to accept that for reasons you chose you decided not to  obtain good gear whether it was from dupers or not, and that other people spend more hours than you obtaining said gear and that they have earned the right to crush you in PvP because your build is inferior and so is your gear. You are literally expecting a casual player to have a chance against someone more serious, that is not how anything works. That is literally like saying usain bolt should be handicapped VS some random fat guy from Mcdonalds so he has an even chance in the Olympics.  
---
Secondly you saying that weapons are unbalanced and gear is unbalanced there is nothing severely unbalanced in PvP atm there are certainly things that need some tweaking some more than others but I say this as somone who has been doing pvp for 120+ levels and has seen it all. Every weapon and armour has counters and these counters are all accessible with one star legendaries and a good build there is a counter to it all. If you don't know it then you literally don't know enough about the mechanics of the game. Explosive weapons can be countered by flame proof and dense mods,  sentinel / cav armour with crits and stagger auto rifles and swing speed melee, vats is countered by stealth boys. But no players like the OP will complain and give up instead of looking for solutions to problems and this is why you don't stand a chance in the PvP servers not the gear just your defeatist attitude "its not fair cos they have xyz". Sure all these fancy weapons give you an edge but no one is unkillable or a god in this game just tougher or better than you.
---
Thirdly you want people start new characters? There is a character limit of 5, so you would force people to delete one of their characters if they have 5 characters and play hours just so they can partake in the new PvP mode?  Doesn't sound fair at all to me at all.
---
And finally just my opinion, survival is ment to be the tougher more hardcore option for fallout its for the strong players the guys that know what they are doing. You shouldn't be showing up to this unprepared its for the guys with the strongest builds and the most competitive players to duke it out. Casual players have adventure mode, you can't get griefed there anymore by the sounds of things so enjoy that and let the try hards head over to survival. If you want to compete in survival get on our level feel free to come in without being on our level but don't expect too top the leader boards.
---
Nope in on PS4
---
While I agree with every part &amp; emotion of being kept in the dark, and I am not trying to give BGS any undue credit, I will keep my hope alive until I receive the perma-ban email. They gave me it back *way* faster (however shortly) than I had dare hoped the first time. Almost had enough time to destroy all the stuffs, but work kept me away.

Congratz, i would tell you some "yo mama joke", but i don't like ban.
---
I do what I do but sometimes I‚Äôm extremely unlucky that no TC spawns in.
---
happy cake day !!!
---
It's called "Leather Coat" and "Traveling Leather Coat". They are the same but the traveling one has a backpack. This is the outfit that goes with the assault gas mask.
---
Happy for you, now go away
---
And also what the max you get? 2 or more? And then you turn it in?
---
Same!
---
People are saying it's from the recent Twitch stream but they are misquoting it. It only affects if you get a mask or not. Not what mask you get.
---
You've mixed up features. "No slap damage" is only for Adventure mode. The rest are for Survival mode.
---
Me too, I made a whole new character just for pvp
---
The "integrity" would last 3 months tops. Then anyone new would would have to still compete with Day 1 players. could they cry for a reset?
---
You earned it.
---
I‚Äôll see you on the field. 
---
Hopefully through my sunglasses and not my scope. Ad Victoriam!
---
You‚Äôre like the 2nd or 3rd person to say that! Think I‚Äôm going creature hunting! lol
---
Yo mama gave me $7 for a photo copy of deez nuts
---
Its calculated as 75%, then 40% of the 25% you still take (so about 14%) the with lone wonderer about 11%.
---
So you're safe at all times when you have Pacifist enabled? Hell yeah! The weekly rewards look interesting. Im not really interested in Survival but this sounds fun so ill try it. 
---
I don‚Äôt blame the developers either. they‚Äôre just doing their jobs. I blame whoever allowed it to be released in the state it was in 
---
Good point. Mabey they could add a system where if you enter survival you have to play survival for at least an hour before being allowed into adventure? The exp wouldn't be that good enough to risk losing your stuff in my opinion. It'll be like 2 more exp when crafting stuff. The 20% extra would only be valuable when farming muties, scorchbeasts, ECT. 
---
I wish bethesda would remove the teammate tagging shit. Its not fun for anyone except the assholes doing it. If one dude wont leave me alone, i should be free to kill him. Me dying to his hidden friends is somehow punishing me for being abused in the first place. 
---
Yeah like I have -zero- interest in PvP but I have -tons- of interest in unique 3\* legendary lever rifles so uh the entirety of the second week in April is going to be spent hiding out in Survival mode.
---
What is the purpose of this post? Just wondering.
---
i mean if they added a pimp cane skin i might finally have a use for these furious walking canes...
---
The point I was trying to make is that using a rifle in a game vs real life is different, and requires aim.  In real life, you have a frame of reference when holding a weapon with both hands, which gives you a sense of alignment.  In the game, I can be standing on one end of the small downstairs lounge room of the Whitesprings Golf Club, and when those two ghouls pop up, I might have to fire 5-6 shots with a rifle modded with a true barrel and stock to actually hit them.  They're like 4-5 yards away, tops.  That's why I aim and don't just start squeezing off in the general direction hoping for a hit.  Two bullets, two dead ghouls, move on the next ones.  I'd like to be able to see my sights when I do it.
---
yeah they cant or ever will be able to stop complaints 100%. im still seeing i got killed by XXX he just came and one shot me for no reason..
---
did you own a workshop?
---
well yeah..
---
you opened yourself for pvp.. dont take a workshop..
---
well thats not fair.. 
---
those posts are pretty much always gonna be around i dont think nothing other than a BIG/HUGE flashing red banner stating "you are entering PVP, ARE YOU SURE" then they hit ok another pops up "are you REALLY sure? your gonna get killed." they hit ok and two or three more pop ups they have to ok through.. then someone contests and they get killed they would still be here complainin its not fair and they were griefed for no reason whatsoever.. 
---
people..
---
Players a year from now won't have to deal with thousands upon thousands of duped god-tier legendaries in survival that were freely allowed to make their way through the economy in the first few months of the game
---
The loot he drops is rarely that good, at least from my standpoint 
---
I was at first but the longer I think about it the more I think it won't matter. There will always be people out there who play 12+ hours a day; after a few weeks it won't make any difference anyway.
---
Cool thanks
---
I‚Äôll take toothy
---
Back in my day games were played with paddles.
---
True, does make sense for a pvp build... why not just go for more survivability then?
---
They have you $7 so you would go away, not for your game.
---
How does this work? I assume I'm too low level lmao 
---
Caps for days! I am hoping the dead person gets to pick where the respawn
---
(If you wouldn‚Äôt mind sharing your secrets, I‚Äôd be very interested. Been working on some anti-sentinel builds myself, but nothing that sounds this effective.)
---
Your copy of what
---
Man it sucks that computers couldn't smart enough to detect that some one was in the event and just assign loot rights to everyone in the event....  
---
I'd rather have that option to start on an equal playing field once than never have it. Especially given how much the game has changed since launch and how much was fixed since then. 
---
I don't want to lock existing players and characters out from enjoying the new mode, but I think there should be an option for folks to start fresh together in a survival mode only character. 
---
I've posted this same thing a bunch now, but really I think the best option is a "hard core" toggle when creating a new character that locks you to survival mode and matches you only with other "hard core" characters. This lets anyone who wants to start fresh do so, while not locking out existing characters from the new mode. 
---
Yeah, my CAMP takes like 30 seconds to load in the first I connect to a server.  I'm ok with that.  Probably don't server hop.
---
Survival mode has no slap damage, it has full damage
---
So PlanetSide 2 but fallout?
---
P E R S I S T E N T   S E R V E R S.
---
As stupid as it sound but just make a new char?
---
Then you got a pvp and a pve char. I dont want tons of stimpak wasted when i play survival for my pve char. 
---
rip
---
Bethesda wants workshops to be contested and not easily held. Because they don‚Äôt want you to be able to farm materials uninterrupted and unimpeded for hours at a time.
---
7$ In store credit means they value this game. Aren't most titles worth 2$ with a free "sorry for your loss" facial expression!?
---
This sub is going to be so full of "what happened, I got griefed!" threads
---
Yes, that was my point. You included "No slap damage" in with all the Survival stuff.
---
Solution: Sure, go ahead. Lose all legendaries and stash in the process, to eliminate duping residue and give everyone an equal footing. and the switch between adventure and survival is a one-way trip. Done.
---
Ok?
---
The fix is to allow a random piece of armor to drop from anyone you kill and not just a random amount of Aid items.
---
The players with the high end gear have to then decide whether they want to risk their OP 3 star items to have an advantage or use crafted gear. 
---
I‚Äôm still not understanding your point, we all know duping exists but you‚Äôre saying we‚Äôre not allowed to complain about it? ‚ÄúI see posts complaining about duper‚Äôs while there are literally more players out there with duped items‚Äù
---
Idk I guess your wording implies a lot to me without actually being intelligible. Not trying to hate just want to understand your reasoning behind quotes like ‚Äúseems weird seeing all the hate but being quiet on how many got the weapons‚Äù 
---
Good to know, thx.
---
I think that PvP shoudn't be confined to the Workshop.  I think that the INITITATION of PvP should be confined to it.  It's exploitable otherwise.  To wit:  Someone contests your workshop, but you're not inside the area, but just outside it.  You sneak just inside, take your shot, then sneak right back out.  Now they can't fire back at you.
---
Put simply, the moment you ENTER the contested workshop area, you get flagged for PvP, and leaving it again doesn't change that.  And when you are killed by ANYONE on the contesting team, your PvP status is removed (as they get the workshop.)
---
If you are inside the workshop area when it gets contested, it happens immediately.  So you can still get smashed by a camper, but you know that is a risk.
---
But no more of this being killed repeatedly all the way across the map by a stealthed teammate of the player contesting it on the other side of the map.
---
I'd also make it so that contesting a workshop and failing locks out that player from contesting that same workshop for a period of time.....Like 30 minutes.  That way they can't do it just to repeatedly grief a single player.
---
I don't think it will change that because the damage isn't player owned.
---
After you've been playing in survival mode for a pretty short time, you're going to have a similar leg-up on anyone rolling up a new character.
---
So how often should Bethesda delete your survival character to ensure it remains fair?
---
If they do this they need to raise the character cap.
---
Diablo Seasons anyone?
---
It works. I‚Äôd play it. An excuse to try a different build every couple months. 
---
Caravan or gtfo
---
I want a Pick-R-Up, in Atomic Cat paint, -w- a stash box and tactical .50 cal or mini gun mount on the back.
---
There's a new tinfoil hat spawn in the frat house in case you missed it :D
---
I think its just that the person who came up with the drop rate for these masks is a sadist!
---
More content i can't play. Thanks Bethesda 
---
Exactly, OP is really just whining about other people putting in more effort than him. I don‚Äôt have all the Gucci items because I work too much, but I don‚Äôt believe everyone who does should have their work taken away because my character isn‚Äôt as good.
---
I think it's an open ended mission, pretty much a To be Continued.......
---
Just seems to make sense. Because I'm at the same point with it as you.
---
I don‚Äôt need to silence you because you literally have nothing to say other than ‚ÄúIM QUITTING this game SUCKS‚Äù and ‚ÄúPAY ATTENTTION guys I just said IM QUITIING‚Äù In fact I‚Äôm going to go back to ignoring toxic shitposters like you like everyone else is already doing. You‚Äôre not part of the community, you don‚Äôt play the game, and when given the chance to add something to the community you just bitch and cry like a child. Literally no one cares that you‚Äôre quitiing! Go back to Apex Legends with the rest of your 12 year old friends and bitch about your skins not dropping or some other stupid cosmetic item you people jerk off to.
---
Hey, don't try to convince me, salty boy. Convince Bethesda instead.
---
Hope you enjoy your break, bro.
---
That wasn't the case last night. The coordinator was out in front of the power armor and nothing happened until the very last robot got to the designated spot on the path for the next attack to occur. They all stopped and waited on that last one and once he got there and stopped, the super mutant attack started. I should know because that's the one I was pushing. Same happened at the sloth. YMMV
---
Or enjoy pvp
---
Is there a copy of the thread saved anywhere I can look at?
---
Your right, it's either out of balance now with old high level players or it will happen later when our new characters are now old again. We wont get around this dilemma so Its best to jus let it happen now. 
---
exactly, not having a slap damage (means having a full damage) is a good thing
---
I've never seen any datamined info. It appears random.
---
I still think it's a poor excuse, they had the resources to verify and ship products that matched the quality they advertised.
---
If I used rotten meat to cook with at a restaurant and people complained, blaming the delivery compony wouldn't really fly. I still made the choice to cook with it. Know idea why I choose that analogy, I'm not a chef. 
---
So that means you wil actually be able to trap others in your camp? Great :)
---
I was afraid of that. Why wouldn‚Äôt they just end the quest when you find them all and then start a new quest if they add more?
---
Those are still the minority of players though, and I'd rather have a chance at equal footing for any amount of time than having none at all. 
---
2-3 days isn't real either. You can't really compare several MONTHS of a game being out and what can be gathered or farmed in that time to 2-3 days. At some length of time there will be a convergence between launch characters and these new ones, but that period of time is way more than 2-3 days, and that period of time is what folks like us are after experiencing. 
---
There is also something to be said about the integrity of building a character, camp, and gear all within the unique challenges that survival mode presents the player. It is very different than farming gear for months in adventure mode. 
---
That's why you shouldn't do something like this without a mic. If this was the case (doubt), then I wouldn't have tried to do the event and would have server hopped. But we had all spent time collecting everything and he starts this crap down by the 2nd bridge.
---
This is directed at Reddit more
---
&gt; Would be great if Bethesda could add more difficult co-op focused challenges and events for adventure mode in the future.
---
It's a live game either they adding content to it regularly or it will quickly die.
---
It's in their best interest to give the player base what it wants and needs.
---
And turn exploits into limited offers that will be abused fast and hard? No thanks. Blizzard should have removed those pets.
---
What its out
---
Not everybody has duped gear and items, not everybody took advantage of ep exploits, not everybody buys their shit on ebay. 
---
A fresh start means these guys don't get to cheat their way to the top of the board. 
---
Sure, in two weeks a new player joining the server will be disadvantaged, but at least it would be a fair disadvantage compared to having to go up against a level 400 xp glitcher who has all the best stuff because they bought it from a duper on ebay. 
---
They didn't work hard for their stuff, and not forcing them to have a fresh character only rewards them with what will become basically their own server... rewarded more so with the unique items they will farm while farming players who earned their shit the right way. 
---
A fresh start means the cheaters who were present at the beginning of the game will have to earn their shit the same way everybody has to. 
---
+karma 
---
Turn on "pacifist" in your game settings. It **will not** prevent you from taking dmage from other players, but you can't accidentally hurt them either.
---
He wouldn't have been able to make you wanted (open to PvP) again by standing in front of your shots.
---
So ~30 Technical Data? Not sure if TC is the same.
---
Just wait till you accidentally shoot someone now
---
Sorry im a bit lazy to read everything. Will you be visable on the map for everyone like in adventure mode? If so, that and also transferring characters will kill the mode for me.
---
Just wish we could say to ourself while out questing ¬´shit there‚Äôs a person there¬ª instead of looking at the map saying ¬´yeah that person is moving towards me, gotta camp here until he is close enough to snipe¬ª
---
My belief exactly
---
Is that confirmed?  I ask as recently there was a demo where someone had two pieces of -50% fall damage and took none.  And even more recently I was in a pvp exchange with someone who basically let me hit them several times and I did no apparent damage to them.  
---
Do you actually think Bethesda truly care about your opinion on the matter ?
---
They still have to deal with legit legendaries and built players. RNG isn't so brutal that 3 months from now or a year or two, you won't have a one shot leg to kill a lvl 5 in survival. Could they then request Survival be reset for them? Why not?
---
The problem isn't leveled characters/items. It's the proliferation of illegitimate items. If you want to fix that, you ban or remove items from inventories. I'm not even sure the last option is technically possible.
---
Im a be a little but you have a battle buddy. 
---
Oh ok good point: Thanks
---
You are not alone
---
My friend has this gear and i can 1 shot him with my build so technically i dont know exactly how it works, but i know they still take damage
---
Ah, okay, that's where the confusion came from on my end. Because Adventure mode *also* has no Slap damage anymore if you're in Pacifist mode.
---
all good ideas!! thank you
---
good point about the initial workshop owner popping in and out of the workshop radius border
---
i agree once you have a workshop, and you see its being contested, you have decisions to make:
---
1) i ignore the contesting player and lose my workshop
---
2) i travel to the workshop to defend it, and once im back in that radius, PVP is on!    even if the I leave the radius, once i start to defend the workshop pvp can travel outside that radius until one party is victorius!
---
Where is Atom's Judgement when you need it?
---
I'd really like to see some response from bethesda regarding all of this.
---
It would make too much sense to do so. It's easier to bug us with and incomplete quest entry.
---
As unappealing as it is to me to have to go up against folks who grinded or bought pvp loadouts, people need to realize that a reset would only be a temporary solution. Any new player after a week or so would already be hopelessly outmatched even if everyone had to start at zero. At least this way they can build their character in adventure and just bring it over. 
---
If you just can't stomach the thought of PvPing against superior builds, maybe survival just isn't for you. Hell, I'm pretty sure it's not for me. I haven't enjoyed PvP in 76. I want those fancy guns though so I'm going to give it a shot but if it sucks, then I'll just bail. It's ok. 
---
Sorry, but its not going to happen. With the layered armor system getting all the weapons setup for all the different configurations so that they don't clip would be a pain.
---
Not that it isn't possible. But for Bethesda, I think this is filed under, "not worth the effort/trouble".
---
That is not a good idea. Survival should absolutely require new toons. That way everyone is on an even playing field. Then you get rid of god builds that would just go around recking everyone. Everyone complains about balance in this game. Bethesda has an opportunity to balance the new pvp mode and it starts with new toons. And no duped god tier weapons. Allowing current toons to be used is asking for more complaints and issues. 
---
I would expect a nuke to act like an environment explosion they said if a player blows up a car next to you then you will get damaged so I would think a nuke is the same.
---
We used to call some controllers paddles back in the day.  
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the bonus didn't apply to non-combat things. Also wouldn't be surprised if the implementation of that was broken so that the exp bonus just didn't work when survival mode comes out.
---
Played rust 3years ago. What the fuck is friendly about that game lol
---
No, everyone that plays casually and doesn‚Äôt have enough time to make a whole new character and ditch what they‚Äôve been playing since the beta
---
I don‚Äôt need to convince them you dumb cuck. it‚Äôs the same suspension everyone gets so duper or just someone who picked up dupe items? it‚Äôs the same result... Just thought I‚Äôd point out your trash-talking Bethesda WhiteKnighting!!! Mr fan boy Bethesda can-do-no-wrong eh
---
Currently enjoying Division 2 and in no rush to come back, but shills like you make this fanatic-sub worth a visit üé£ 
---
Hope you enjoy living in your parents basement solely playing Fallout76, bro. 
---
Don't spend it all at once junior - mamma needs rent ;-)
---
#NO
---
Everyone knows open world PvP is super fair.
---
The northwest area of the cranberry bog is great for random high level critter encounters. 
---
I was rebuilding my camp, stored everything, had to log off for a bit in the middle of rebuilding. When I came back to complete it, I was missing doors, lights and other decorative items in my stored tab. Not quite the same, but similar issue.
---
A classic they really need the radiation attachment for super sledge
---
Finishing up in about 2 hours dudes. Hope you make it! 
---
What you described sounds like workshop pvp.
---
My sloth actually froze like the guy I was replying to said. Had to wait until the meat pile to loot 
---
The early early early days of rustüòÇ lots or role players or players ready to work together and make clans against each other.
---
There are some terminals that you can hack which allow you to deactivate the turrets. They aren't particularly obvious.
---
Well I don't mind the budget cost, since workshops give you a "free" budget that I use for defense.  Have you noticed specific ranges they are not good at?  Because sometimes they do not activate at what seems a reasonable range.
---
If everybody has to start fresh day one, that still only levels the playing field for people who start day one, new players in a month or two after survival launch will be just as disadvantaged. Level matching servers is a better solution, it reduces the chances of better geared and higher leveled pvp players ganking noobs. There will likely still be twinks but that is at least more manageable then a lvl 100+ killing you as soon as you are eligible. 
---
My work is fucked lol
---
I think we are going to see even more of these honestly because people are already saying it is PVE mode and that is a lie. It's PVP light with PVE in adventure mode.
---
They already don't get it with slap damage as a thing, it is going to be worse when they think they can't be touched
---
And it was on a console.
---
idk maybe more common than i thought, i mean i always thought the lil german kid types were the outliers, im comin up to my 50's and been dealing with people that enjoy pvp for years, i dont really care for it not my kinda thing but im friends with people that enjoy the hell out of pvp, even had friends throughout the years that have never touched a storyline or missions of any kind and just played to fight other people.
---
sometimes theyd entice me into battles with them, sometimes id win, most the times id lose, more so as i get older and hand eye coordination wanes, but i see and accept pvp players and really dont mind em. 
---
had one level my camp few weeks ago, was in a trade with a guy id found on reddit, he followed his trader friend to my camp and leveled it while i was in middle of trade screen, got on area chat said "really?" he asked me if i was mad.. said nah nuttin to get mad about easy fix.. dude was nice enough to give me some serum recipes and said "here since ya so cool about it, covers cost of your camp." told him anytime he needed a camp to destroy come on back lol
---
What do you mean?
---
I apologize for the wording... I agree duping is bad and was bad for the game and 100,000‚Äôs of all different things got duped. 
---
We see people commenting about dupers just hardly anything about the people who received the duped items which in my eyes is worse since they are the reasons more dupers started dupping. 
---
There was a business there, selling for caps and some places money. 
---
In the real world you buy knowingly stolen merchandise you get in trouble as well. 
---
Seems like people are given a pass on this for buying duped items. 
---
I‚Äôm not including those who farm for literally hours doing this! Much respect to them! But they are the minority here. Also the players who have fought and gotten them or bought them from someone who has. 
---
Let me ask you... knowing how many people duped... what do you think the percentage of players with duped weapons is vs players who actually earned them? 
---
I‚Äôm guessing at least 60%+
---
To whom it may concern, 
---
 I liked the way the game looked, they way ot felt, and how i could play with my brother, but i didnt like how the game played. I beat the game in one day...i played everyother fallout on the hardest dif (not survival) but the one nefpre that. What i mean by beat the game was the story. It almost felt like there wasnt a story. All i no is the oveersear was walking around trying to nuke the scorched. But in fallout 4 i vould tell you so many diferent stories anout preston. Or the brother hood. Or even about piper. Fallout NV. All the bandit gamgs, the strips, all of it. But that just me. But bethesda makes good games. Just bite off more then they cpuld handle. Amd maybe the devs where ya no
---
I got knight first try i domt even like the paints either 
---
It's just a game, y u heff to be medd?
---
Noo man, i did it over 20times still dont have that frivkin beret!!! Without server hoping i would be already frustrated. Waiting hour for another owl mask.
---
People aren‚Äôt going to want to do survival mode if everyone in it is already full build and kitted to the teeth cheesy guns and full unyielding, sentinel, or the other ones. 
---
It should be an equal start for everyone. 
---
I don't think it needs to be a one or the other situation here. 
---
Let new characters flag themselves as "hard core" survival characters only that are matched with other flagged characters. 
---
This lets the current design work for current characters that are bounce between both modes, but also lets folks like OP (and me) have the experience we're looking for in survival only characters. 
---
I'm all for the whole server showing up to these events - just wish it could be a bit more challenging for all.  Right now its far too easy to clear the enemies for the higher levels, leaving the rest to just walk around leisurely.  I've done it a bunch of times and haven't even been able to tap the sloth a single time, and am not on some low level toon even.
---
Will keep that in mind next time üòé
---
I‚Äôm joining. Albeit late. 
---
Prob less creepy if I say yes?
---
The only thing I've seen turning in more than one at a time do is increase the EXP reward from 350 exp to 400 exp.
---
I got my T-60 Knight Paint last night by turning in only one Tech Data (350 exp reward).
---
Have not been able to correlate anything to do with quality of rewards to the higher quantity/exp reward for gathering 2 or more before turning them in.
---
It appears to be just random.
---
ah good point, i have noticed the robots shooting at the cargo bots
---
I see you on the duped weapons point. But reddit does not represent the majority of the player base.  Maybe if they put it to a pool that could be done upon starting?
---
Makes me not even want to move my base again, which I enjoy doing trying to find the perfect spot 
---
Nothing was mentioned about removing the glitch that allows a team of two players, one having the mutation that causes electrical damage on hit, they get get on either side of you , one shots the other through you, that electric burst registers that you hit back , although was that players teammate . Then you are fair game. I have seen it in use a few times. My crew and I aren't noobs. We know very well about workshops and pvp mechanics . I never see mention of this glitch . It is not a myth. Try it yourself if you'd like. Get a teammate with the melee electric mutation, I think it is grounded. Have them stand so that they are touching a non hostile player with their body , and shoot them. The game will register that the non hostile hit you back . This allows forced pvp. They did nothing to remove this.
---
You still have the option to start a new character in Survival tho. No one is stopping you from doing that.
---
Will never not laugh at hurricane lol (not in a mean way) 
---
I enjoyed unturned a whole lot
---
Same for me, I checked out the new event after not playing for some time. It was great, lots of players. Talking/posing. This one guy even bought a couple of mutations from another guy and gave them to me for free. (Marsupial and speed demon)
---
Good times.
---
Then what about people who played genuinely since BETA? They get shafted?
---
100% agree with you
---
No I mean like how much TC you usually stop at before you turn it in?
---
Who's side are you on?? 
---
Ah alright, I‚Äôll be here lol
---
The problem is all the duped god tier armor and weapons/builds getting transferred into this mode. Bethesda had a chance to start with a clean slate and balance the pvp servers. They done fucked up again. 
---
What if they are in stealthboy? I burn through stealthboy in pvp so people can't vats me lol.
---
I‚Äôm dead üòÇ
---
You can technically already do this.
---
I agree that the game was released far too early in development, it clearly needed more time, however development more then likely wasn‚Äôt the one who called the shot to release the game, it more then likely was the higher ups of the company, the ones that don‚Äôt care about the game but the money of it.
---
Guess who‚Äôs reading reddit? Not the president over in the Bahamas, not the ceo playing golf with investors trying to get them to buy more stocks, it‚Äôs the guys working hard to keep the game stable, fix historic glitches, and bring future glitch free content that cost you 0 dollars!
---
I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs misdirected hate, the employees need respect for sticking to this game regardless of how much misdirected hate there is too them, that‚Äôs what I call good service.
---
Super sledge, spear, anything that lets you keep the rads at the end of a stick would be fine with me. 
---
I joined late probably, that game is madness. Fallout is more like twilight, people don't like it, but it is nice lovestory. :D
---
They didn‚Äôt mention lots of new things that are in game now tho
---
That‚Äôs our usual tactic to be fair. I‚Äôm one of the invisibuddies. Haha. 
---
That, or just bounty hunting. The most fun is finding the invisibuddies before they find you. 
---
Watched my fianc√©e fall for that trick too many times. She‚Äôs cute, but she‚Äôs a sucker for a high bounty. Doesn‚Äôt have the build to match, bless her, but she tries. It‚Äôs not very Brotherhood of me, but I‚Äôve started sending her in first to get a bead on the invisibuddies. 
---
I definitely started noticing this once the new event was added, the update came and went fine but now when I load into a server I'm stuck or frozen for half a minute to a full minute before everything loads and it's just a mishmash of texture pop in everywhere 
---
I disagree. Past level 50 you don‚Äôt get more powerful stats wise. Also this will just delay what you perceive as a problem until a month down the road. 
---
Same thing happened to me. Stole my couch, radio, and potted plant. Darn you Todd!

Someone just posted a picture of the Sun Mask on Twitter.

Me and my friend both got suspended again just like all of you. We both put in support tickets and my friend received a reply from customer support at about 4:30 PM est. They stated that the reason we were suspended is because of server performance issues due to too many items in the world at once because of mules, etc. He then told my friend that his account would be reinstated when they found a fix to this issue in a later patch. Idk if this helps clarify anything, but if it does let me know.
---
Recently? I've had no luck.
---
So in order to be good at pvp, you shouldn't pvp, but grind pve instead.
---
Nvm it's Ezmeme. I'm stupid
---
The team flagging was put in because there were trams exploiting the hell out of it in pvp when the whole team didn't flag.
---
Right? The only bounty I‚Äôve ever had was lock picking a safe that was on the property of a workshop even though it had nothing to do with the player lol. So dumb 
---
Worm hat
---
This would be noce
---
All things belong to Todd; he needs them for his master race CAMP.
---
Okay.
---
No hard info, just what I've observed. Machine gun turrets have a tiny aggro range, and don't seem to fire reliably until one of them is damaged. Missile turrets will actively target mobs and hostile players, sometimes outside of the build area and any walls
---
That would solve none of my problems with the game in it's current state though, it would if anything agrivate them more when I'm still playing legit and some kid that bought full assassin's sentinel farms me while im leveling, it's iether forced new character or why bother?
---
"You still are open to pvp if you take a workshop"
---
you can still fast travel
---
Agreed, made a new account just for pvp
---
What‚Äôs wrong with people server hopping to do an event? 
---
Shareholders/board members, pretty much the assholes at the top of the company that bitch about profit not being more then last year. 
---
Pretty much all the shit in the world is thanks to the fuckers at the top of every company that only see it as an investment. 
---
Oh, whatever the server has. I don't believe the more TC you have, the better your loot is. Submit tech data &gt; bunker &gt; buy stealthboys &gt; find tech data &gt; Hop server &gt; submit tech data. 
---
For what? 
---
There arent that many ppl on the server at a time, and there are many players of many levels going to play.  Calm down.  Risk, reward :)
---
They actually do now.
---
Source: I use a drunkard build without Professional Drinker.
---
Like even a drink that would let you emit radiation upon successfull hits would be rad
---
booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
bad bad bad idea
---
i need me some ballons man!
---
I'm glad they're giving a dedicated mode for PVP but I don't like the idea that the legendary rewards are only available in the PVP mode.  Based on the weapons they have shown, the legendary attributes have been manually placed and therefore the attributes work together (instead of 3 random legendary modifiers like you normally get from a 3 star, where 1 or 2 of those modifiers might be useless).  It almost makes it mandatory to play this mode just to do the weekly and get the weapon, even for people who don't want to do PVP.  I like the idea of new legendaries being added to the game but requiring PVP to get them is not going to be enjoyable for people who don't want to partake (I would like to partake in it but the whole idea of people running 75%+ damage reduction from duped sentinel armor means it's not an even playing field).
---
This is true. I will be kind of salty if some noob gets it, LOL
---
I am getting a bit bored with this quest but I'm sure I'll do it a ton more times and get the same five things. *sigh*
---
Pvpers often get to a fair truce once one team is beaten to a pulp. .. Depending on the winning teams mentality.
---
Most of us are fully geared, near max caps, overflowing with junk.
---
Most of us are geared in a way thay mitigates a ton of dmg unless the other player is well versed in the counters to sent/cav gear. 
---
What you are asking for is bound to happen. Gang vs gang skirmishes will turn into a larger gang rolling around eating wanderers, killing eachother and having a blast. 
---
My buddys kill eachother for fun now. Why would we stop in survival?
---
If im obviously out gearing you, spawn camping you, i usually get bored and talk to you. It happens now in adventure.. Ill tag a workshop with a player on it. Kill them a bunch. Leave the circle so it reverts back to them (i dont want their resources or whatrver they own the workshop for) so i let them keep it. Then we talk about builds, pvp etc
---
They appear to value it pro members get $7.70 in store credit where FO4 will get you $3
---
Maybe they love winter and don't want to see it go away
---
Youre always in danger. 
---
Thanks! Changed!
---
In game lore, the BoS are just raiders with fancy technology. Fallout 76 is the first time I've seen them try to actually do something for the common good (eliminate the SBs) that wasn't misdirected. CMV. 
---
Fully agreed. But before they attempt to do so Bethesda should focus on improving the food/water ratio, you become hungry/thirsty way to fast. If they can improve that then they should disable fast travel all together for Survival Mode. I mean it's called Survival Mode after all so we should theoretically 'survive' without the need of fast traveling at all.
---
It's a new mode. Nothing is erasing your progress in the old one. 
---
Don't look at this as being "shafted". There is no victimization at play here. It's a new start - one this game desperately needs to survive.
---
Yeah I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a pretty accurate percentage, but I still don‚Äôt buy that dupers wouldn‚Äôt have done it without monetary reward. Even if no one had bought them they‚Äôd still give the duped items to their friends and outclass 99% of other players. 
---
A lot of people just find joy in exploiting and I think they‚Äôd do it for free just for the thrill. 
---
The problem is it‚Äôs hard to prove intent, one can‚Äôt say for sure someone knew an item was duped unless explicitly stated. Also The fact that Bethesda doesn‚Äôt even know which items were duped makes that argument tough to defend in this game. 
---
#AGREED
---
Truth. It's...just...dangerous.
---
I'll check the event location.... cheers
---
I am stuck on biv's daily as I need a red crimson flux
---
Yeah I‚Äôm happy with being killed to a random sniper, or have someone come charging to me with a shotgun.  I‚Äôm fine with pvp, I just am hoping it isn‚Äôt like a respawn and die game, just go out get kills, die, do it again. It‚Äôd be cool to have some tense moments like alliancing with people, but run the risk of them killing you. So basically if some people aren‚Äôt set to kill on sight I‚Äôm happy.

But you still haven't said what that tool is.  Everything you have listed is something that is already in the game, they are only removing the slap damage.  Everything else you listed is something I could log in and go do to some level 6 player this afternoon including slap damage him which will eventually kill him if he doesn't leave or heal.
---
agreed, id like to know if the people i drop artillery on deserve the slow death or not
---
I agree with one exception. Allow people to transfer their gear/characters from Survival to Adventure. This way, players can't break Survival mode by coming in with fully geared characters, but they can still transfer the reward legendaries to Adventure mode if they so choose. 
---
It's still a conscious decision since the item/character wouldn't be able to come back to Survival, but it would also let players be able to transfer items to a more applicable character or transfer characters if they got tired of Survival.
---
Closest similarity I would say is the Ironman mode from OSRS that got added a couple of years back. It's a harder mode, since you can't utilize any other players' assistance in any way (excluding a couple of quests), but you can disable the "hard mode" to switch the normal game mode with the understanding that you can't go back.
---
I feel like the Survival Mode could do well with a similar function. Give players the ability to bail out and transfer items out to Adventure mode, but with the understanding that those characters/items are never coming back to Survival.
---
I'll check that location out.... cheers
---
Hard pass on getting one shot from level 200s+, thanks though. 
---
Agreed! If these bans/suspensions were handed out to dupers (with proof) then fine, but so many people have been suspended either for duping or for "playing the game" with no further information about the situation except for an email stating "you have too much stuff, is a huge middle finger to the playerbase.
---
But hey come E3 Bethesda will sell some more paper bags with turds and all those flaming suspended people here will throw cash at them once again. 
---
There's already a major faction war...
---
Pvp Vs Pve, the two biggest fractions in West Virginia. 
---
I maxed thru hiker early game bc I was struggling to manage carry weight. Later on I tried to swap it out and it increased my weight by 110 pounds (!!) Lol I like having plenty of food and drink in my inv so it's been an extremely useful perk for me
---
Bethesda has ONE shot of getting this right, or they risk having the same fiasco as early game OP TSE weapons and rampant duping.  Call it a beta or what not - there is NO turning back this decision once players are allowed to freely switch characters between the two play modes when the Survival beta is rolled out.
---
The downside to Alcohol Addiction is so minimal and so easily addressed that it's really not worth spending three points on. Alcohol is ridiculously common even without the addition of brewing, so if the two single-point stat penalties are ever actually a problem then a five minute search of some random houses should net you multiple bottles of booze, assuming you're not carrying any yourself.
---
My account isn't even over unencumbered and got rebanned 
---
Think about how awesome a helicopter would be
---
I just restarted a character a week ago so I could make a better build for my play style. So I‚Äôm only level 20. In the parade I try to help out but I can‚Äôt do much damage yet. It doesn‚Äôt matter to me if I miss out on all the earlier rounds of baddies, but I appreciate being able to get one hit in on the sloth so I can get a little xp and some better loot. 
---
It may be causing stress on the servers.  I think simultaneously means you won't have to worry about what server you're on, and can make sure the servers aren't being worn thin.
---
Hey, I really appreciate you taking the time to write that all up - this is going to go to good use tonight.  I do the loop at WS too, though like you said it's generally hit or miss which chunks have been recently wiped out or are currently claimed.
---
Gonna do some West-Tek and Watoga runs tonight and see how it goes, then maybe move a couple points just to see if it changes anything.
---
#whoa
---
5k lbs lmao. Let me throw some math at your feeble naive and quick to point the finger brain.
---
Your mule has 5k lbs. You level said mule with a friend(this is the only way to level with the new limitations on overweight characters). You pick all weight reduction cards on said mule. Said mule now has 500 lbs. Wow so crazy can‚Äôt believe omg!!!!!1111
---
Oh and the funniest thing is, while you‚Äôre judging him for supposedly lagging the servers out with his 5k of junk, your main character likely has more total items than his character, it just doesn‚Äôt all weigh 5k due to weight reduction.
---
And if you knew anything about what you‚Äôre passing blame and judgement on people for, ya know database optimization, then you would know it‚Äôs not about the poundage, it‚Äôs not about the quantity of items, it‚Äôs about the quantity of individually unique items, each creating a unique database entry(I.e legendary items).
---
But of course like any typical redditor you start throwing that blame and shame around even when your ignorant low iq brain hasn‚Äôt even tried thinking of what the actual problem is.
---
No hoarder will ever be able to hold a candle to a duper, when it comes to sheer items being held and impact on server stability.
---
Server stability?
---
I still have a 60 percent chance of crashing on scorch-beast queen or from holding a workshop. So no thank yous coming from me. 
---
I play Fallout on Xbox because of the Mrs, but my IGN in every game on PC is the same as my Reddit Screen name, and I mostly game on PC. 
---
Or switch servers?
---
Hey there, sorry to be another begger but I'd LOVE one, I've recently got myself a full set minus the helmet, I'll pay in caps or whatever i can if you're willing to trade one too me :)
---
What level are you lol? 
---
Yeah I'm for this if they start showing what people did griefing will skyrocket from everyone trying to out do each other. Lmao I might even become one.
---
That is how it is now. You can shoot them all.
---
The only team gets a flag for you, not the other way around, its setup to fuck anyone that wants a fare fight honestly.... 
---
It does, thank you!
---
To me that effect alone isn't worth 3 points. Idk.
---
They can still make a new character to join the survival mode. Unless they made X number of mules. 
---
What does it matter about beta players? Because they got kitted first they deserve to keep being top tier. Sounds a little entitled. 
---
All this mode is going to be is Fallout 76 the Battle Royale experience. 
---
Ran the event a dozen times chasing for the beret, which dropped on that last time. I've at least gotten duplicates of all the common masks, except for the witch (only have 1 of those). But have not even seen other plays wearing the rare ones. 
---
Wait until it starts.  I was one of only two people in town when the event started, within a minute about twenty people had fast traveled and joined us.  Too bad the server crashed before (probably when) the boss spawned.
---
I‚Äôll check that out today! Thanks! 
---
I have the same problem 
---
I think the seasonal idea is great.
---
They could give players from prior seasons a Perk Pack, for example, for every prior season where they reach level 50 so there is a benefit to being a longtime player, but it isn't prohibitive to newer players wanting to try out survival.
---
Thru hiker is a life saver 
---
Now that's a mask I would want. 
---
I can help you with that last one..
---
"when a man loves a woman very much...."
---
No I made a character for pvp mode when they said that it was coming and we could transfer. If they go back on what they said because a small fraction of the player base on reddit, the whiniest social media platform of them all, they will be called out for flip flopping too much and not setting a decision in stone
---
Well, as I said, increase the occurrence rate to 45 minutes after last one starts.  Since each one takes about 15 minutes, that means you have 30 minutes since last one finished.  Enough time to go farm the wood or intestines or whatever else you want to do between events.  More people stick to the same server, so you get to know people doing it over and over again.
---
Either way, it's an inconvenience.
---
There's a guy saying datamine shows that drop rate is 1% and I'm trying to argue that claim.
---
Probably not a big issue. If everyone on the server is playing the game they'll all be leveling up at similar rates. What I would say though is that the matchmaking should add new players to the server based on the average level of people already on that server.
---
This super nice!
---
I like the idea of weekly weapon rewards and having them all be uniquely named. My primary concern is that some of them simply wont be strong enough to survive the game's meta.
---
The revolver and fatman look fairly helpful depending on your build, but others will be completely overshadowed by far more powerful legendaries. (I'm looking at you, Bloodied)
---
I'm sure several of the weapons wouldn't be worth the effort, but overall this a welcome edition for me!
---
It's a BETA, where important changes need to be made
---
Pvp is good, there are some meta build like in every rpg game. Ppl complaining are probably lowbies, why should we grind something that we spend 300+ hours farming?
---
The slap damage is the tool.
---
The ability to damage another player, even slightly is the tool. They have to react to it. 
---
I swear BGS is just going to throw all the masks into the atomic shop after the event ends and charge 10$ per mask. DO NOT DO THIS BGS. FIX THIS.
---
Too damn many days,i think i was born old.
---
My back and knees are "feck you" years old.
---
I'm 39. 
---
*Holsters Fat Man*
---
Since the last update, when I spawn at my camp I fall through the map for a few seconds before everything loads in. It's actually killed me a few times üòÇ but luckily my bag was lootable or I would have been a little upset
---
What happened with "faction based" part of it that they teased long time ago?
---
Welp raidings not going to be as fun anymore
---
Why would you get downvoted for this?? Its a perfectly valid point.  
---
I saw a level 19 with a fugly mask, light blue with a middle embedded in the fore head.  
---
Yeah I know what simultaneously means. I haven‚Äôt saw anyone complain saying the server hoppers might be the ones that are causing the lag. This is new to me. 
---
I‚Äôve done the event quite a few times now. The first time I did it, I got disconnected. That was my only time. As for lag? It‚Äôs usually when I fast travel there. I just give it a few seconds and try not to move. Sometimes you just have to get things loaded in first. Btw wonder if all of this happening could‚Äôve been avoided if Bethesda actually had the servers go down first instead of the event just appearing like it did... 
---
And not exactly hard to use Photoshop.
---
Yeah I'd love a witch mask‚ò∫Ô∏è All I have is the Owl, Bald white guy mask, and Giant mask 
---
I know people are saying that they wish it was a fresh start but that would mean in 2-3 weeks, when everyone is geared/leveled again, that any new character would be at a huge disadvantage.  At least players can level/gear safely in Adventure enough to stand a chance in Survival now.
---
Separate inventories actually sounds like much better idea than everyone crying to make everyone start fresh. I want to keep my same character because I want that XP buff. It also alleviates the problem some have for being able to ‚Äústock up‚Äù in Adventure mode. 
---
It REALLY isn't. Do you think Call of Duty is too? There's like 16 people in a server. That right there doesn't meet the requirements to be called "massivey
---
Yeah I was going to add this is all in theory though because often enough you get stuck at the first defence prompt without any toads showing up for a few minutes lmao
---
I‚Äôm level 14. Where can I find the plans to craft it?
---
Yeah see there's the problem. Smarter people than me would have to figure that out.
---
Good point - I hadn‚Äôt even considered the long term yet. Maybe Bethesda can mention that as well
---
I agree i wish the survival servers just made everyone start anew. When i started at launch I was paranoid of players cuss I thought that's how the game worked. It'd be nice to get that feeling of paranoia back.
---
I agree 100% with your opinion OP, it is a mistake
---
It‚Äôs not like you can quit out of survival mode and switch characters like we do now. 
---
Pardon my ignorance,  but how would that work? I've never seen a method to reliably transfer between characters.  Or are they just setting up a second character for the sake of giving that character an edge later on?
---
Not trolling,  just genuinely curious. I'd love to see a way to transfer stuff between my characters.  I almost always find nice melee stuff on my sniper build and vice versa.
---
I don't give a crap about overpowered players. If you're going to have a survival mode, everything should be earned in that mode, not in easy mode and then transferred over. What is even the point?
---
It doesn't
---
The biggest issue is that boring people will hoard resources in adventure and then spend them in survival.
---
Yeah, I camped there once not knowing that was keeping him from spawning until someone told me. Moved my camp once I knew. Lol I was one of those asshats 
---
A while back someone posted essentially the same post, and BGS replied saying that survival mode will be in beta when it comes out and will change as time goes on. I think that they are going to allow you transfer ur current character there right now just to test the game mode out.
---
Exactly, it seems to be so hard for some people to imagine that Bethesda never ponied up for quality dedicated servers hosted in-house. No no instead we get amazon cloud servers, likely being ran on some terribly optimized Amazon OS. If any of you have a firebox or fire stick from amazon you know what I‚Äôm talking about. 
---
If you look at survival mode like the division‚Äôs dark zone or RuneScape wilderness, then being able to switch over with the same character doesn‚Äôt sound bad at all. 
---
Also food and drink expire way faster now 
---
Sure.  I‚Äôll hold that one for you. I have to work tomorrow too, but I‚Äôll try to get over to Starbucks, snag their wifi and jump on the game from my phone.  Thank you PS4 remote app!  Lol. I‚Äôll send you a friend request now from rip67.  
---
If I remember correctly, a terminal outside of fort defiance 
---
The problem is being able to switch between the 2 freely, and the fact that a small majority of the player base will already have a giant advantage from the get go. I am really surprised to see them do the new mode the way they are, knowing about all the duped god tier weapons and armor in the game. That is my biggest beef. 
---
If you are starting a new character facing down a level 50+ that has a TSE they got in adventure mode is still going to be your end.
---
I would like to have a train system. It could be a quest like the Powering Up quests, where you have to send out robots to repair any given line, then the line gives free travel between its stations for a few hours. 
---
I've ran it only a handful of times but the one time we lost a bot I got no mask. So I don't think it's 100% health just they all need to survive
---
My original idea was to just make it so all legendary item modifiers are not active in survival mode.  All gear is treated like regular versions of said weapons/armor.  Fair and balanced.  You can move back and forth between modes.  Adventure mode the legendary items work, in Survival they are just treated like regular items.  Looks like that's not going to be the case so it is what it is.  I'm happy we can at least move back and forth freely.
---
The plans are on a computer at the entrance of fort defiance.
---
Need plans please or are they a drop?
---
Definitely use this tool to plan your build and see a road map of when to pick perks. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111111&amp;d=&amp;w=&amp;n=
---
That's because they put the "DLC" over the map. Not in the original map. IDK if I explain myself. Try to load in next to AL's Tattoo and check the door. It appears after all the loading time, about a minute later.
---
If you slap damage a griefer, that just opens up the PVP window though, which is exactly what they want.  So my old choice was deal with their antics and slap damage but now I just have to deal with their antics.  Seems like a win for me.
---
It's in the atom shop
---
Interesting 
---
I mean with the right perks, and a vats crit on the head its pretty easy to 1 shot a sentinal assassin player in pvp... just a thought
---
Be mic active and hope for the best. 
---
Oooh that would be awesome.
---
It's not worth anything really. 
---
High level players basically use workshop pvp to hunt people now so this is not a big enough change in my opinion... there needs to be a level protection so if someone is say more than 10 levels above you they cannot contest your workshop.
---
Seeing as this mode is brand new, a level playing field to means rolling up a new character and starting from scratch.  Porting fully kitted characters from adventure mode doesn't seem reasonable.  If everyone starts at the same point, all of these rewards and leaderboard stats will seem a lot more significant.  If a lvl 400 player with all the best 3star gear is dominating the leaderboards, what chance does anyone else have and how boring will that be?
---
Given 76's rough start and duping fiascos, plopping existing characters into a new format seems like creating a game mode where cheating has been grandfathered in.  I'd rather have all of those items swept away, everyone starts out the same, and there's no lingering doubts of cheating, stacked decks, and the like.
---
I server hop for rad ants and death claws at the substation north of watoga on occasion. 
---
Since the patch, I have to log out somewhere else, or the deathclaw will have murdered all the ants and started to chew my face before I can even see it. 
---
fuck yeah! :D should be fun
---
I'd rather have the chance to have an even playing field. Enjoying that time period between now and a year from now is so much better than not having that opportunity at all. 
---
Who really cares about a cosmetic item even? I mean...yeah they're cool and funny but not something I'd wear long term, yeah it sucks they made an event that doesn't award items it says its supposed to....but oh well, no skin off my back. Lol
---
Thanks, I appreciate it. I'm available all day tomorrow and I'm a night owl so whenever is convenient for you. 
---
Same. Ran it 22 times. 3x did not get a mask even with all bots alive. 
---
Got witch once, owl once and beret once. The others are all soldier, toothy and the ugly green one over and over. 
---
I‚Äôve only had 2 rounds with loosing any, I‚Äôm just wondering if health pool could effect the out come. 
---
There's no difference in the AI between modes. ADV isn't "easy" mode. Those legendary items were still earned
---
This should be all modes but it totally needs to be a thing.
---
not sure why i'm even responding to you as your logic/understanding of my suggestion went straight over your head. of course you wouldn't understand what i meant based on what people are complaining about. if you have shitty gear and are not ready for survival, go grind adventure mode for better gear until you are ready for survival. even if everyone started at level 1, most casuals would be so far behind after a week everyone will be back on here complaining again about something. 
---
survival is for the hardcore players. if you are complaining about fairness or gaps you don't even know what survival is for. bethesda is giving the HIGH level players a new way to play. while anyone can join a survival server, it isn't for everyone. i'd expect nothing less than EVERYONE in survival to be wearing god tier armor and weapons. at least the queen fights will be with properly geared people every time lol. no more lowbies showing up and tagging then hiding hoping to get free loot.
---
I agree that reddit does not represent the majority of the player base (even if they think they do), but we know how widespread duping was and an idea of how many god tier weapons there are in the game, not to mention there are rumors of duping still taking place. 
---
I think it was him/her and a friend using one of their secondary characters. Or they we're just going to be a vendor. I'm not entirely sure myself, I just thought their argument for being allowed to carry 2.t cars worth of weight was absurd
---
Ive never seen a BoS rifle
---
I'm with you on that. The discussion of just how rare should this really be isn't confronting me. It's the people calling for the heads of Beth developers over not having a mask drop. I hope to god there are barely any after this week and they don't get duped to high heaven. Better yet if there is never a chance at then again. Make them a real treasure.
---
I made this very point 900 times when survival was first announced. 
---
People think mandatory new character rolls = balance. It does not. It won't be balanced after the first few days when those few people play 20 out of 24 hours just farming away. 
---
There also seems to be this notion that Survival will be this bloody free for all murder setting. It won't be. There's greater risk + only 20 people, plus a big map.... You'll see an increase in PvP but not this arena situation everyone seems to think it's going to be. 
---
There was no text, it was literally just the title. I believe it had 6k+ upvotes and multiple gilds by the time it was removed
---
What‚Äôs wrong with doing that?
---
I nuked at lvl 39. Was carried by lvl 250.
---
Adding in gratitude forvthe upcoming PvP changes, as a player who isn't interested in it, they are welcome
---
This was done for those of us who have made our characters specifically for PvP, you know, for 5 months, not have to start all over, we all got many opportunities to play and find what we need to optimize our builds, having to do it all over would suck so bad. 
---
why did they make all of the best masks the rarest :(
---
soemtimes even the legendary item takes a bit to appear on the dead body
---
That seems like a no brainier to me. Without factions everybody will shoot each other on sight. Which is pretty boring.
---
same happened to me. lost everything you lost plus some workbenches and neon letters
---
Yes, I asked if this was fixed because it has always been that anything not on a cement slab would not move, so things like crops,  large purifiers, generators, etc  would get lost and I'd have to remake them and this cost me more materials and time to again gather my crops.  I was told by another reader that they now get stored but I haven't tried it.  After redoing my camp 3 times when the game first came out and losing multiple crops, generators and water purifiers, I never just place my camp I always store all these items and just leave my main structure which always seems to move without issue.  I know it doesn't make any since and until this last update the choosing a different world option didn't work.  So it must mot be fixed yet, so thank you for saving me the lost mats I'd have lost if I'd have moved my camp.
---
Not when overencumbered which would force someone to drop some stuff.
---
Interesting theory. Good luck convincing people to not run up to get their one star legendary gear. No one stays around the bots thru point 2. Maybe me and one other person each time. 
---
I'd love to see if drops change with full health. 
---
Diablo 2 was released almost two decades ago. Can you remember anything else besides videogames that required way more effort two decades ago than today? Well, I'd say: pretty much EVERYTHING! Go back even further and this becomes even more evident. Time + technology = convenience. Buying stuff on amazon is kinda cool... so is streaming millions of songs and movies or having instant digital access to the detailed history of the entire universe. In the not-so-distant future, people will look back to our times and say: do you know how many hours they had to spend stuck in traffic before we had intelligent self-driving cars? And even further in the future, people will say: do you know how many hours our ancestors had to work in "offices" in order to collect this "money"-thing just to be able to "buy" what they wanted and needed?
---
My point is: times change. And so does society. 
---
Younger people today often can't get into older games because these were made in a different era by and for people with a different mindset. Likewise, to us older people a lot of the new stuff seems too oversimplified and too streamlined, because we're still used to the things we grew up with.
---
The difference is: Hopping servers in 76 a hundred times in order to find an X-01 jetpack doesn't add an ounce of fun or challenge or sense of accomplishment. It's not a reward for getting good at the game. It's tedious, mind-numbing and boring. So is having to rely on random drops from random events to get random rewards. I'm not asking for instant gratification without having to work for it... all I ask for is the time I'm spending with the game to be interesting and engaging. 76's obsession with RNG is neither.
---
Appreciate the kill. Thankfully got to loot her before kicked. Hopefully get back in. üëçüèº
---
Yooooooooo where my raider homies @????
---
Sounds like a good time. Now what would have made it better was voice chat üòÇ
---
It's annoying but fair enough when it's a new player but there was someone at nearly 200 there yesterday so it really was a dick move. I often wander how many people who post about their camps getting attacked all the time are either there or the back of Whitespring. Personally I just spam no and angry emotes but I think orbital strikes are also reasonable at those spots.
---
Yeah, I used to try and get there as soon as I saw the announcement that the nuke was going to land, but it just is annoying, especially as melee, having to compete vs ranged weapons haha.
---
I usually stay far away until I only see a few dots huddled around the club house (usually people hang there the entire time the nuke zone is up), and then do a lap on my own.
---
You can trigger your own fresh spawns every half hour or so. That applies to most enemy spawns on the map I think.
---
But I usually do lap somewhere and go away. If I'm still on the same server half an hour later I might go back again (if it's still empty), otherwise server hopping to trigger new spawns works (assuming you don't get dumped back on the same server you just left).
---
Sorry to tell you man but that rifle doesn‚Äôt have that great of perks compared to other options. And in survival mode you‚Äôll have to fight people that already have levers and handmades and whatever with much better legendary perks than are on the sole survivor rifle. Sorry to burst your bubble.

My name is Toddikage Kira. I'm 47 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Pennsylvania, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Bethesda, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. 
---
I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to see Skyrim getting pirated I wouldn't lose to anyone.
---
I'm not saying they should let players keep duped items. But if its their oversight that let people have stuff in the first place, and not through means outside of the game, ie save editing it should be fair game. Those players shouldn't be punished for finding an exploit, especially if they didn't know they were exploiting.
---
White springs or whenever we get a new event just set up shop right outside of town. If there was a shop outside of Helvetica (sp?) than they would make a killing selling Purified water &amp; ammo. 
---
We know this is you MxR...
---
What about MOC's, Custom Insurgents, Savages, Buzzards, Deluxo's, Avenger, let's turn this into a war zone ..
---
Fuck that. I want to continue building my character, not lose him every time I start getting comfortable with my build. 
---
It is still a pvp light server, that doesn't change
---
This exactly! Imagine how cool that would be to play with survival only characters and knowing that anyone you come across struggled with all the challenges of survival just like you did? 
---
I don't like the idea of completely locking out current characters from the new mode, but allowing those of us who want this new unique experience of survival only characters. 
---
A "hard core" flag you choose when creating a new character that is locked to survival and only matched with other "hard core" survival only characters would be amazing. Without this, folks like me (and OP) are left out. 
---
I am fucking dying
---
42 playing on PC. But have the game on XBox, just nobody to hang with. LoL
---
nice, good job.
---
Wait for him to despawn, he should leave a meatpile which you can loot
---
I already have the moon mask? I bought it in the shop... Idk how to show pictures in here, but I'm on xbox gt: DJohnnyEmaus and i'll gladly meet up with you and show you
---
i AM the liquor 
---
Yeah they are basically saying raiding is not a viable RP path, which totally blows
---
I think the point is that as a new game mode, it should be free of disasters from 76's past in order to be credible and have any chance at long term success.
---
Whether they do or do not won't make a big difference. If they don't then it'll be the people who have taken the time to build great builds terrorizing those who haven't p
---
If they do then people know exactly how they want to build their character and soon enough it'll be the people who play this game as their main hobby terrorizing everyone else.
---
Bethesda would be better off with a reduced reward for killing people X levels under your own. No reduced damage. Just encouragement for those above level 50 to not terrorize low levels. 
---
Yes I know low levels built properly can kill higher levels easy enough, this is just a thought.
---
Good idea, I don‚Äôt want to run around for hours only to realize I‚Äôm on a completely empty server.
---
The new event doesn‚Äôt cause this, I‚Äôve seen this for months. 
---
I'll have a look around Whitesprings, thank you.
---
I don't want to use it in survival mode. I just want it. Maybe show it in my CAMP, make it my signature weapon, like how the Silver Shroud has the Silver Submachine Gun.
---
&gt; this game has a player base of less than a million people split across like 3 platforms.
---
Where did you get that stat from?
---
And oh man are people going to be surprised when they are still getting ganked
---
The problem is, that would naturally have occurred over time. I don't think we have exact drop rates yet, but combos like TSE or AS are obscenely rare if there are many people out there with hundreds of hours who never found one. One person duping it hundreds of times to give to friends and sell to people takes away months of natural economic progression. The amount of this stuff out there right now is what would not have naturally occurred until many years from now. Even with heavy whitesprings grinding, at this point only the luckiest and the richest should even have one piece of it, not to mention the whole set
---
I have gotten 4 coats in around 4 hours. I have one if someone wants it. 1500 caps is reasonable I'd say. I am on Xbox.
---
Bon Voyage cursed Raider!
---
Roleplaying as a raider was hard enough imagine what it is like now. 
---
With pacifist mode enabled nothing will happen.
---
i was
---
I disagree. I want a more dangerous experience for my leveled character, and survival gives me that. It‚Äôll be like the wilderness in RuneScape. 
---
Pvp play does not mean you are scum
---
Thanks, some good ideas in here I hadn't thought about. I have most of those perks but didn't have the +damage to glowing and I hadn't thought of putting perks into gunsmith 3 and 5. I somehow also wasn't aware of the energy damage perks. I have a legendary The Dragon (one of the only good legendary drops Ive had) but I got it at level 30 so it's only 35. I did once use it to sneak up and blow the face of a wendigo, which was fun.  I keep my The Dragon around for those big fights but now you've got me thinking I should vendor it or sell it and put the gauss in that position instead.
---
perhaps their is some hidden variable like a robot that doesn't follow and can die, maybe there is a enemy robot that spawns in and you cant kill that. it also takes a while for the "get ready for the parade" phase to be over, maybe you have to do something in that time period
---
Damn synths.
---
You should reread the notes. That is changing
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Brotherhood\_recon\_rifle](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Brotherhood_recon_rifle) 
---
It will get rid of all the duped, bought pvp builds. And people will actually have to work for their build. It would absolutely level the playing field. There is no logical reason that people should be able to freely transfer between the 2 modes. 
---
You could also use the same image to justify a DT increase based on how much alcohol you're carrying.
---
Xbox player, was able to see it in the shop since last night
---
Same, I  may never use them but I just like the thought of donuts in the post apocalyptic wasteland. 
---
Is there a coffee recipe anywhere out there as well?
---
Why would the Brotherhood of Steel go around recruiting random Civilians.  They are only after those with Military Experience and shunned everyone else.  They didn't appear to care for the forces that the civilians were putting together.  Working with them was not their priority.
---
We sneak our way into being accepted by the remains of their automated system by lying to and exploiting remnants of the automated bureaucracy.  Had the remaining members still been alive they would likely have rejected us as well.
---
Yeah. Any train station will have one on a bulletin board. 
---
Well, shit.
---
Agreed!
---
Great take on pvp, keep plugging away and improving your spot in the fallout food chain. 
---
Death should result in level loss, that way it'd really be a constant fight. 
---
Great looking camp, love the way you‚Äôve strewn everything about. Makes it look very natural. Question for you‚Äîto this day I cannot find the Metal Signs (i.e. ELECTRICAL) plans. Do you happen to remember where/how you got them? Through an event reward? Vendor?
---
I've only just seen this since the event started. It's almost instantaneously after it launched. No idea about your situation but for my loot runs to just end up like this the day of the Fasnacht launch cannot be coincidental. Before that everything ran smooth.
---
yes. complete coincidence.
---
Lol you‚Äôre kidding right?
---
If someone wants to risk twice their level in caps and dropping their aid items, all for a little extra xp (that at a certain point is useless), the by god let them, the risk hardly seems to fit the reward so I see no issue.
---
They aren‚Äôt removing it only taking away slap damage
---
Sorry, who?
---
I think there is but i dont know
---
Pretty much impossible unless you just hang out in the pvp areas
---
This post shows why there is no risk to them. 
---
Nice... very home-y and this probably the first time I've seen the junk/clutter used for that effect... very cool.
---
You've already decided what your opinion is, you're not open to actually discussing an alternate view. I'm done with you I guess then. You're essentially a broken record. 
---
A mod reviewer on YouTube who specializes in outfit mods that use ‚Äúless‚Äù material than othersüòÇ
---
Slapping the shit out of players that want nothing to do with PvP. Gathering all your mats in a relatively safe environment, farming weapons... all to then leap over to survival (which is not at all survival if you can jump out of it at any time)..
---
not only will it make adventure a shithole for those who want to play adventure, it will turn survival into nothing more than "Fallout: Battle Royale".
---
Nope. Make the switch a one-way trip from adventure to survival. Everyone gets to keep their levels and perks... loses all legendary gear, and empties their stash.
---
We need text chat, not everyone can freely talk or listen all the time.  
---
I think the lingering doubt as to whether an opponent's gear and items are legitimate will hurt Survival in the long term.
---
If the challenge is skill vs skill and your claims of prowess are true, then you should have no problem starting from scratch and dominating the leaderboards.
---
As soon as I started reading your post I immediately imagined WoW mounts as an example because it‚Äôs such a similar comparison. I farmed those raid/dungeon mounts for an incredibly long time and I‚Äôm still missing the vast majority of them because the drop rate is so low, but at least you can try once a week indefinitely. 
---
The fact that these masks have a similar drop rate and is limited to a few days is incredibly bullshit. If I haven‚Äôt been able to get mounts like Invincible in a decade, why the fuck would I throw myself at a wall for these masks just to have the same drop rate? 
---
The dollar amount tells the story...
---
Always go for the decon shower first!
---
They seem to forget that in a month when a new character comes into Survival they stand no chance.  At least now you can gear/level up in Adventure mode to stand a small chance.
---
Well, actually, being on leaderboard goads people into attacking you more often, which can easily bait people into their own deaths with a good gank squad set up to kill any would be potential leaderboard hunter. It translates into easy caps + loot for those smart enough to create traps.
---
This sounds hilarious, I hope you made a video! 
---
At least we can all take comfort in the fact that the giant mask is common.
---
Griefers are not after pvp, they are after grief. You had the option to do something about it in an in game fashion before, now you just have to leave the server or just deal with it.
---
This happened to me once.  The marker showed him "underground" but in reality he just hadn't loaded.  It took nearly 7 minutes from the time I joined the server and walked into Helvetia to the time the Event decorations and robot NPCs finally loaded.  He loaded in with 30 seconds remaining for someone to talk to him.
---
That is something I am looking forward to as well
---
Sent you a friend request message me on psn when you are online and I‚Äôll join and come to you
---
Thanks for the idea!  
---
I have made mine with the Fire Breather Uniform.

---
I WILL say that it‚Äôs gotten much worse since the event started. It was like 10-30 seconds before, now it‚Äôs usually minutes. 
---
Mid 40's. On Xbox. Just really getting started in the game (level 6 right now). It'd be cool to have someone show me the ropes so to speak. Fridays are usually my night to be on late. 
---
Berserker is tied to your damage resistance. Being in power armor raises that so your damage goes down 
---
Set another bench down then. Or delete it if the game allows that.
---
Kind of a boring thing to repost...or laugh about, but ok. Glad I'm bringing so much enjoyment? Sounds like you need it.
---
You seem fun at parties
---
Caravn hasn't been invented yet. It was created by Hub traders around the time of Fallout 2.
---
wow so these are just going to be stupid rare then
---
Maybe this has been discussed befor, but could the mask drops be tied to time on a specific server? For example if you stayed on one server and did the event every hour instead of server hopping?
---
You don't have to buy anything from them for them to buy it.  You can offer items up for sale and if they want it, they can buy it.
---
Huh :O That's super weird
---
I've wondered this too. It seems every time I play, players run off into the woods or run up ahead. I'm always taking up the rear solo. The bots get damaged every time. A few different times we lost a bot, but were still awarded with masks. So I wonder too what would happen if we nailed 100% health. Better rewards? Regardless, it's fun.
---
I imagine it'll be very similar to DayZ in regards to an "arena of death" where certain areas are where 95% of the fighting will happen, so whitesprings, Charleston ect... it'll naturally fall to 1 of these sort of areas, and just sporadic fighting between
---
Oh ok. 
---
Or just some details on it.  Let us know if we are doing it "right" or if Beth just likes to make things so rare as to not exist.
---
I wish Fallout was more like Destiny with how it handled the World and players. Where the overworld is a hub where everyone can interact and take part in public events but goes into private sessions with "caves" or in this case should be buildings of interest where you must load into a different area. 
---
You would have the ability to keep playing your character in a "season" model, it would move over to the current character pool when the new season started. 
---
Good! Tired of slap happy goobers, asshats destroying Camps, and jerks messing up events. 
---
Bring on the dislikes leet pee vee pee kids.
---
You are correct, but in effect that's removing the need for me to care one way or the other.  If someone can't damage me (and apparently my camp down the road), and I don't want to engage, I can completely ignore the situation and go on about my day with no worries.  In my mind, that's close enough.
---
Same here. Have an upvote. You won't convince the dupers and ebay kids though.
---
25. I can use mini nukes if that'd help - shrug-
---
"I don't like chocolate! Why do you guys even care that you can't get that chocolate bar?!"
---
- you
---
I have no idea. I've played a lot of hours and I have most of the plans, so I can't remember. Sorry.
---
But I think I have those plans in my stash. Let me check it.
---
there's some at the beginning but are hack level 3, other level 2 ones you'll find in the middle
---
Also the whole "fix all the pipes" part can be skipped by lockpicking a level 3 lockpick door and then hacking a level 3 terminal right after it
---
You got bent over
---
No I just busted you on what your trying to do. You‚Äôve started with statements that are tricks.
---
I also pointed out his we can take the data from the poll as factual.
---
Since you have no logical response you come back with attitude.
---
Which is also what entitlement looks like. The whole how dare you response.
---
Totally doable, totally rewarding the griefer for their efforts.
---
I actually think this is worse than something they destroyed because now you are essentially doing it to yourself.
---
I think, the rads add a nice zing.
---
Yeah, the 5 soldier masks and 7 tooth masks has me not wanting to do the event anymore
---
You know you can say no to GameStop right?
---
For AP boosts and refresh I wear ultralight (+5 AP per piece) and have all stars of Grim Reaper's Sprint (any VATS kill has 35% chance to refresh all AP), Action Boy (45% faster AP refresh), and all the VATS crit meter refresh cards too (4 leaf clover, critical savvy) so that I get more crits for fewer shots and can take fewer overall shots, thus using less AP to begin with.  in most situations, by the time my reload animation for the hunting rifle is done I'm back at enough AP to take the next shot.  I need to experiment with mutations more but so far I haven't put much time or thought into that. I'm level 91 and I don't have starched genes yet.
---
True, it's a good revenge weapon against griefers :-)
---
Love the vault boy in the portapotty!
---
I just figured I'd tack another suggestion on that a friend shared with me: Consider removing legendaries or limiting them to 1 star. I don't think any PvP is excited about having luck and ebay trading be a primary component of surviving this mode. 
---
&gt;  All i no is the oveersear was walking around trying to nuke the scorched.
---
So... you didnt do the story?
---
so not only you, but 4 friends stayed up for about 46 hours with almost no sleep?, how do you even wake up 2 hours into sleep after staying up that long and then get right back to playing the game again?
---
It ain't about a weight someone's carrying. It's about how many weapons/armors and how many variants of items someone's carrying. 20mil nuka colas ain't gonna do nothing to crash a server, but 5000lbs of assorted weapons will. especially if that mule is equipping perks and weight reduction armors to help him carry even more. Wanna know how much my two shot fatman weigh? 0.04 pounds. and 5000lbs of that is A LOT
---
&gt; barely anyone has them
---
did you read the OP at all?
---
I use an Automatic AAE Handmade
---
I never had this issue before but I must say it makes farming almost pointless. 
---
I really hope this doesn‚Äôt force everyone who wants to be a player vendor to move their camps to higher traffic areas.  I like my cozy little spot in the outskirts of Watoga damit!
---
Never put a single perk point in lockpick or hacking yet lol but that sounds nice I personally am not a fan of the fix it part of quests when they don‚Äôt show you where all the pipes are that you have to fix but thanks
---
Doesn‚Äôt make sense how a stim and alcoholic beverage weigh the same 
---
You can send them a message.
---
I mean that would add a challenge to it but you would need probably 2 or 3 other people on board to do it. Also the fact that voice line is in feels like a hint. 
---
Gt?
---
5 of the 10 masks haven't even been seen by anyone on this forum. I've watched hundred of players play the event and have seen a total of 5 masks. Doesn't that seem a bit off to you?
---
On Xbox, I truly wish more players had/used mics, negotiating a trade through the XBL messaging is a royal pain in the A$$.
---
That said...If you are using a Mic, please be considerate of others in the area that have to listen to your screaming kids, siblings, friends, spouses, dogs, tv sets...Did I miss any? Please just pay attention to your background noise and mute your mic if needed.
---
If you don't have a mic, just google "Xbox, PS4, PC, or Gaming Headset" there are a lot of decent ones available under $20.
---
Ah, well, then low tech it is
---
Is this game worth playing again i haven‚Äôt touched it after week 2 of release? 
---
i think that you can also get the fasnatch man mask from the parade(the mask from for defiance)
---
Me too, bog life forever. I will buy from your watoga shop!
---
I don't think shit like this bothers anyone but you.
---
yea i got only giant masks :(
---
Same here lol. I took a swing at mole rats near another players camp. Knicked a turret and became wanted. Actually went in search of a lower level player, took off all my armor, dropped some loot and asked him to Kevorkian me.
---
So my over 200 hours in 1 character should all be for nothing if I can't try a harder mode with it?
---
I am level 118. I have spent hundreds of hours farming, trading, buying, selling, fighting, and adventuring to get all of the gear I have now.
---
I was the original Unyield in bloody, I never used TSE, I switch between different melee, and my build is not a min/max. I have the perfect camp spot, my character is perfect in every look, and I have tons of good rolled weapons that I have bought and traded.
---
Are you telling me that my 100% legit character that I put an actual fuckload of meticulous time into to should be invalid in PvP because of every other fuckwad out there with TSEs?
---
I have been doing PvP since the beta and as a melee bloody build I can say this- unless if it's relatively close range and the enemy knows exactly where you are coming from, Explosive weapons are not that bad. Given how survival will be it's likely their will be no radar blips or name tags, so getting the ambush on someone will be easier. Ya'll love to complain about griefers being a nuisance in PvP, but 99% they don't even know how to fight someone they don't see in front of them.
---
LOL 110 pounds? That's rookie talk! I swapped it off to craft ammo and suddenly gained 1500 pounds. I nearly died of laughter.
---
Checking in!
---
I agree 100%. Time and tech have obviously changed people's attitudes toward basically everything. I for sure have some trouble with finding any replay value in older games these days for exactly those reasons.
---
I guess I just wonder where is the line in our existing world of what's an acceptable "grind." If it's 1:1000, is it any better if it was 1:800? Does it need to be 1:100 or 1:8? 
---
This game doesn't seem to be about achieving any kind of particular goal except the ones we set for ourselves. At least not yet. What does getting good at the game really mean? It surely varies from person to person. Many people wouldn't ever consider having a purely cosmetic item a mark of success or being good at the game. Only a marker of your grind for the item or the cap to by it or your willingness to spend your monies on a few lines of code.
---
Server hopping was never something I was a huge fan of, but practically speaking, it's our only chance at finding certain plans, outfits, etc. All of my best gear, outside of my super tasty chest piece, I got from farming ammo to sell for caps that I turned into gear.
---
I enjoy fo76 very much even with its many flaws since day 1. I have gone at it with several play styles each to create new challenges for my self. Much like playing through Zelda without getting extra hearts or as few items as possible. I've hopped endlessly for plans, at times to no avail. I've made it my goal to capture every work bench and fight the torrent of other players after them or me. I've played to make friends and help new players.
---
I guess my bottom line in regards to the drop rates and the rng is this important life lesson I'm sure you know well: sometimes you can do everything right and still lose. At least in game the consequences are truly unimportant.
---
You mean this subreddit that actively downvotes anything positive about pvp?
---
Upvotes anything negative about pvp?
---
That calls all pvpers assholes and griefers driving them away from this community?
---
You mean this subreddit that considers slap damage "harrassment"? 
---
That thinksslapping people after the parade to see if anyone wants to PvP is being an asshole?
---
Are you talking about another reddit community? As a pvper id like to know where they are . this place is full of toxic carebears.
---
That would be a funny twist, I wonder if the code could reflect that. 
---
Sorry :(
---
You don't need to solve new players a year for now. Being able to enjoy a level playing field for even a few months seems totally worth it to me. 
---
Saying you'll have the same problem a year from now as a reason not to allow for a really cool playing experience from now until then doesn't make sense to me. 
---
How about this?

---
So.. standing there and barfing directly into it doesn't do anything?
---
If it is 0.03 percent it would be similar to other rare drops in the game 
---
The amount of people here that are "the rarest things should be rare" are killing me. We're not just talking about rare. OP is essentially arguing that they're NOT possible to get, they're NOT dropping AT ALL. Meaning there is something wrong that needs to be patched. 
---
Jokes on you both, neither are OP, you both just need to git gud and learn counters. But hey that‚Äôs fine, bring your caps to survival for me will ya. Bring that full sentinel assassin set too just so I can 1 shot ya, can‚Äôt wait.
---
Haha.  It‚Äôs not your fault man. 
---
It‚Äôs glitches for me, but it‚Äôs also not glitched, and I‚Äôve gotten several legendaries. 
---
So it doesn‚Äôt always glitch, but it does seem prone to it.
---
I've enjoyed playing my unarmed build without the use of PA but here is the thing, there are times when you have to wear PA... nuke zones for example or just XP farming ghouls at Whitesprings where you could easily get swarmed by 20 or more any time and you just can't survive that kind of DMG spike without PA. Now I have 1 point in each of the three Gladiator cards so I muddle through with a 1 hander in PA but I'm still doing far less DMG than when I'm unarmed out of PA.
---
The developers are in a hard spot. One, they can't let us use fist weapons as it is without eliminating the three bracers because using both would be OP. Two, the developers would think too difficult is to adjust and rework the game mechanics for both PA bare fist base DMG and PA bracer mods to be be higher and scale-able. My suggested solution is to create a new bracer mod that only adapts fist weapons to be used with PA and have to be used in pairs.
---
The early days of survival will be a glorious blood bath and will slowly settle into tense standoffs with a few factions patrolling the wastes.
---
yep! Tons of DLC happening right now and coming down the line
---
How about this? https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3d8468e&amp;d=pp2p00a72a42a30lv2l71lr2sg2c72ic4eo2lt2pg2pi2ph2eh2ej1la2a00ir0&amp;w=&amp;n=d_Munkey%27s%20Rifleman
---
Thanks bud!   You will get a discount. 
---
think about your goal, use a planner the other guy posted here to help you.. it opens up in later levels/game when you break the 100's to respec point by point but, you are looking at 25+ levels of point swapping to respec + however many points you need for new cards.   
---
i had made a shotgun/sniper build from the beginning, keeping str and per balanced to keep both guns viable, then the tse nerf came along and around 140-150ish i had to respec to drop shotgun and go perception for rifles and vats, spent prolly 15ish points in new cards and then 20ish points moving perk points, so basically 35-40 levels to respec.  
---
your build wont really complete until your in your 80's or 90's, since yeah a build planner can set you on track to have every needed perk point and right cards in place for your build but thats not covering your cards you want to hot swap like lock pick, hacker, ammosmith, super duper, weapon artisan, white knight, power patcher, and other quality of life perks that add into the top end of the build.  
---
so a mistake now, no its really not going to hurt you, it just gonna take a few more levels to get exactly where ya want, so wouldnt be afraid to take something that might be helpful at the time, but i would still suggest that ya keep an idea of the direction you are wanting to go in to help save having to spend 20 or 30 points/levels later trying to fix something not working.  
---
granted once you break roughly 150 and just start stacking points since youll be set build and quality of life wise a quick change from there wont be too big a deal since you will have points waiting, and once you start getting above 200-250's you can start investing in things like a 1 star rad sponge, 2 star rad sponge, and 3 star rad sponge and if you keep building higher 400's to 600's and higher you could  have a 1, 2, and 3 of every card, with points sitting so all ya have to do is switch out points anytime ya ever wanted to change a build.
---
Yes, but I Silo codes are pretty instant...
---
Because the BoS was wiped out and some of us are trying to bring them back in spirit to fight the giant flying doom bats before they kill the world.
---
The same reason we side with Taggerdy and launch nukes instead of Maxson who was like no way
---
Noice!
---
I decided to be a squishy heavy gunner build. I'm running an explosive gatling gun and a Grog axe for backup. I get into the fight and have a blast.
---
I'm planning on throwing some orbital strikes and Mini Nukes at a Fasnacht parade later today.
---
Fair warning.
---
sweet thanks
---
Earl Pusser. Displaced Redneck, that see all this post-apocalypse stuff as just a reason to have some fun. 
---
Shotguns and big ol' handguns. Lotsa beer. Shoot first, ask questions later. Farmer ingenuity (translated as lots of oddball contraptions made from junk).
---
The poll on that used flawed data. So the results aren‚Äôt correct.
---
We don‚Äôt know the drop rate.
---
People need to relax over this. You‚Äôll either get one or you won‚Äôt. 
---
The game goes on.
---
The very few images of the masks that are currently circulating is from console. No hacks into the dev rooms there, as far as i know..
---
Compromise: You can transfer from Survival to Adventure, but NOT from Adventure to Survival. (Basically, you start in Survival and can go to Adventure whenever you wish, but it's a one-way-trip.)
---
Wow thanks so much. What platform are you on? Checking here http://www.falloutsearch.com/features/Fallout-76-Vendor-Levelled-Lists-for-Plans/ it only looks like Grahm carries it‚Äîthough some have said it‚Äôs a workshop reward. Can‚Äôt understand why this particular plan is so rare relative to all the others. 
---
I never said I didn't like anything. I'm just saying they're pointless items for a game. And for someone to go to all the work to poll people and get data and and make a pie chart and then call it completely unacceptable is a little much. Yeah I'd like to have a mask but im not going to all that kinda trouble to complain about something. 
---
Yeah, I have 4 of those in my stash lol.
---
I think they are the ones you are looking for. I play in spanish, so they don't have the same name, but yeah, I'm pretty sure they are the same.
---
If you are on PC I can give it to you.
---
Over time, it won't even matter.
---
What system are you on?
---
Yup. I find myself on an empty server in adventure pretty often.
---
I run with a decent sized guild. Often we realize its just us on a server!
---
I posted a similar comment to this but I‚Äôm about to write multiple times now. At this point I‚Äôm almost starting to believe that there is no headset and Mike support for fallout and then it‚Äôs just a big hoax being perpetrated on me. I‚Äôve had an Xbox since The first one came out, and I‚Äôve never use the headset until this game. I finally broke down and bought a headset about three weeks ago, and I use it every single time I play now and that‚Äôs a lot. I have still never heard one human voice. I have my mic annoyingly set to always on, no push to chat or anything, and set the area. I don‚Äôt know if people can hear me, But I can‚Äôt hear anybody. Ever. Not one voice. Like what in the motherfucking fuck?
---
I would suggest finding a weapon type you like, and also have a melee backup if not main. 
---
Melee is super helpful when things are swarming you close range or little roaches and insects. 
---
Once you find what you like build around that. 
---
The counter to assn/sent is to get lucky with a stagger before they one shot you, or catch them while they're moving and one shot them. That just doesn't sound like a good time to me. Thing is, that's a balance issue, not just a "we need a fresh start" issue. 
---
Here is what I see happening on the pvp server:
---
Lots of people try it out, having a good time, get ganked over and over by the full assn/sent players whom they stand no chance against, because hey, they have godmode unless staggered.
---
The players like me who enjoy PvP but aren't here exclusively for it will leave because there's no point - all the good farming spots will be heavily camped, the rewards are lackluster, and it's not fun to get farmed by players that can't be killed unless you manage to stagger them.
---
The only players left on the server will be full assn/sent one shot ranged bloody builds. They'll get bored because there's no one there for them to fight besides other god mode characters. They'll eventually go back to adventure mode or just quit out of boredom.
---
still you wont get it unless ypu buy it or have insaine luck
---
Yeah, I'm just saying you shouldn't also need Thru-Hiker on top of Professional Drinker which is already costly in perk slots. It would just make sense to give no alcohol addiction and weight reduction of alcohol together, otherwise what's the point of Professional Drinker? All you need to do is use Thru-Hiker and not worry about addiction cause you just never stop drinking anyways.
---
What ever it ends up being, it will be difficult to get a spot there. The no build zone around a camp is very large.
---

---
I dont currently have screenshots but I have gotten knight and knight captain and I have a friend who got officer paint.
---
No, you still have your character in adventure mode
---
Their dignity
---
I was able to complete the event despite it being in a nuke zone sooooooooooooo.... 
---
Remember to leave pacifist on when you're helping out other workshops during their defence events, by the way. Better not to risk accidentally blowing up a workshop owned toothpick that puts a bounty on your head.
---
Where you gonna post?
---
I just stood in Whitesprings waiting for the deed to be done lol 
---
I need to be connected with this person haha. 
---
I think that‚Äôs a clever suggestion. Like a replay mode for the crimes‚Ä¶
---
You need to learn how to better communicate your thoughts. Seems to me you're the only fly sticking to the fabric horse. 
---
I do a mean barbequed brahmin if you want to set up a shop.
---
you don't get it.  this fix isn't meant to eradicate griefers but it does limit what they can do.   it's like you're complaining to a car mechanic that an oil change doesn't eliminate your need for gas. 
---
"This adjustment effectively eliminates ‚Äúslap damage‚Äù and should greatly reduce the likelihood that you‚Äôll fall victim to any unwanted PVP."
---
no.
---
can i buy a tooth mask off of you btw
---
The reason why this game is getting softer and pussified is because of you fuck heads. The harder the better.  
---
That goes through assn/sent for full damage?
---
Only Grahm sells them? Maybe I'm looking the wrong ones, idk. If you wanna come and check if they are the right one no problem.
---
\^ What he said. I would say be careful about what you are spec'ing, but yeah, keep in mind you can always change your SPECIAL points later on, and get different perk cards. However, it's also important to remember that the game might seem less interesting if you've invested in 5 different builds, and aren't sure whats happening. So definitely plan it out, but don't be afraid to experiment. 
---
And the Charisma support player is viable, there are weapons you can get that heal others when you score crits and such, I have a friend that does it and it helps a ton in SBQ fights and whatnot.
---
Yep. I'm with you on this. Very curious.
---
I recently celebrated the 30th anniversary of my 28th birthday (I think that qualifies), and regularly play with several guys older than me on Xbox.
---
Sometimes we just Team up for the shared perk benefits and each do our own things, occasionally helping one another along the way with info, cheap Fast Travel, sharing mats, modding stuff or whatever.
---
Feel free to shoot me a message on XBL @ Medieval Paul
---
Yes, exactly my point. Thru-Hiker can make alcohol weight 0.1, at which point avoiding alcohol addiction is pointless when you can just never stop drinking.
---
Professional Drinker needs some love.
---
Or any weather patterns at all on that note I thought would add a really cool element of realism
---
Ha ha ha... "I volunteer as tribute."
---
I would think any spot nearby places that people go to get their 1400 caps/day should be good. Best time to shop is when you are flush with caps!
---
Whitesprings Train Station, Whitesprings Bunker, Watoga Train, Watoga BOS, and Harper's Ferry come to mind right away. But to avoid Scorchbeasts, I kind of see Whitesprings being the obvious choice...
---
As there are too many Responder and Raider places to choose, I'm not sure folks will settle on any one of those unless it has other advantages such as the Charleston train station for folks farming the vendor there. (But not so close as to ruin the chance to trigger the spawn.)
---
The other option would be near Vault 76 for the free travel...
---
I got it from irrational fear event. So not only dailys. 
---
I got it last night on xbox
---
yeah MxR is a fun sub to watch... too bad 76 isnt his bag of tea, as hes a MODs guy....
---
I like stabbing it with a flaming pitchfork purely for aesthetics 
---
I had nothing removed from any character on my accounts. And none of my characters where close to the absolute weight limit. I've posted as much evidence of my innocence as I can, both to clear my own name and to show that Bethesda stuffed up. They're flags or detection system or whatever is broken.
---
Its the giving accounts back and then taking them away again. Without warning. While they happily ignore the issues and give us a clown festival. This shows me that they both do not care about their players and  can take away anyones access to the game in an instant. They don't need to give you warning or reason. They don't respond to tickets. 
---
Imagine waking up tomorrow and you're account is suspended and you get no reason why and no notice. You know you never cheated. Yet you can't play. It's incredibly frustrating.
---
It's the coat raider corpses wear with the green scarf like collar
---
You're absolutely correct, not everyone has duped gear and items, myself included. I'm level 217, I played since day one release, I never participated in duping at all, I found all my weapons and gear while playing with a group of friends. 
---
I've poured well over a thousand hours into the game, building, min maxing my character and generally becoming the biggest bad ass I can possibly be, specifically to wreck people in PVP because its what I DO.  
---
I would have GLADLY been playing survival from the start but alas it was not available.  I will be playing survival, you make me start over, its going to make a lot of players like myself QUIT because we thought we were playing the one and only "game mode" available.  
---
I DID work hard to get where I am, it wasn't "handed" to me as you would like to think, there are LEGIT bad-ass mother f*ckers out there, make us start over and it will not save you from us.  we will out grind you, and probably just get irritated by the fact that we were forced to start over to give cry babies an arbitrary sense of security, if we don't just outright quit for the inconvenience. 
---
If you have the time do you think you could take screencaps and show me? i havent been able to farm tech data since wifi at home is bad
---
Honestly the CAMP items are the best part to me and I think I'm just missing the confetti pile one.  Now I just need a beret.  I haven't gotten a recipe yet either, but I don't really care.
---
I think that it is actually just a rare thing. Other rare outfit event drops have a roughly 0.03 % chance of dropping.
---
I want to play and then just get one shotted by someone who has two shot explosive lever action with 1000 stimpacks and chameleon armor cause thats sooo fun 
---
Have you seen the complaint posts in this sub?
---
There is one right now about a dude blocking a bridge with power armor at the parade.
---
Objectively false opinion.
---
This. I roam through town for a minute then come back to the meat pile and get my crappy loot 
---
Rare implies possible, we would post bragging about their drops if they are dropping under normal circumstances.
---
What‚Äôs your gamer tag?
---
I‚Äôve done the event about 15-17 times. Didn‚Äôt keep count. A few times robots got destroyed and no masks were given.
---
I‚Äôve gotten 4 owl, 2 toothy, 2 giant, 2 witches, one soldier, 2 berets. 
---
I‚Äôve gotten one sausage and two donut recipes. I‚Äôve gotten multiple camp decorations, balloons, flag poles, bunting, confetti piles, and wall flags.
---
I‚Äôve also had just wolves and sting wings show up, just the sloth show up, and sometimes both. 
---
Troll toll.
---
That said you can also hop servers
---
U can kill urself and then spawn anywhere u want on the map.
---
This actually increases what they can do. It limits what all players can do, and increases the options for griefers.
---
I'm 35 and only occasionally fart. Stopped drinking pop lol. MrsP123 girl gamer here :)
---
Oh, that makes sense to have a friend help out. I am usually playing solo - most of my group of friends don't play much Fo76 at all so that hadn't occurred to me.
---
They should have left adventure as is and launched a 3rd server option: PvE 
---
I dont like changing adventure.... But im a raider. I wanna be able to shake you down at your camp. 
---
Gimme 10 stimpaks or i break your decon shower!
---
Ok I wondered given the gills on the neck. Thank you for your insight.
---
I think its a great idea being able to transfer between game modes. Maybe I should try and address bethesda with a long drawn out reddit post making my point? 
---
The difficulty is that the dev room exploit makes it hard to trust the evidence. I know they were banning people for that , but people were duping.
---
When is death match coming? Lock 7 guys in the school with some Death claws. Last person or beast gets the prize. 
---
Vaulters like you are why Fo76 is so great.
---
Haha. I got the idea when a random player visited my house. He opened the door and I thought: "would be nice to have a little surprise in there" xD
---
New players a year from now can be solved in other ways (seasons has been discussed in this thread), and isn't a reason not to provide current players now (or in the near future) with this opportunity. 
---
I support a best of both worlds option that lets current characters play both modes as it is planned now, but also allow for new characters to specify themselves as "survival only" characters that only join worlds with other survival only characters. This lets people start fresh with others who want to do the same, and lets current characters enjoy the new mode too. 
---
They can solve the issue of new players a year from now over time, but the game has changed so much over the months that a fresh start with like-minded people is really appealing to a lot of folks. 
---
Well that's too bad.
---
Looking to sell any of them?
---
I've decided I'm going with nearby to Watogo Station, I like the flatness. Thanks for the reply!
---
I was so excited for this update but now I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôll be returning. OP players coming into PvP mode sounds wack. 
---
Lmao, go crawl back into your safe space. Gonna sit here and lecture me about real world problems, dude hasn‚Äôt even experienced the real world if he gets so butthurt over a little comment like the one I made. 
---
What a big baby.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt play survival mode if it were to drop my weapon and Armor item. 
---
That‚Äôs probably the same for the other 99% percent going to play it. 
---
And after 2 or 3 weeks when none of this will matter because several people will already have level 50-100 accounts with all the best gear anyway.
---
I dont want two characters. I want to play both gam emodes. I dont see any problems with it.
---
Sure thing - not sure if the PVP types will be interested though.  These will be intensely co-op focused challenges and not just co-op PVE.  The carrots or rewards would be far different too - swag like new skins, clothing items, CAMP objects, etc...  nothing that would appeal to the power hungry types.
---
In fallout 3 they weren't raiders at all
---
42. Lvl 80. Only ever played solo wouldn‚Äôt know where to begin in a group, but willing to try :)
---
Found you 
---
agree my char still has 2.3m stash weight even after wipes. i got 1-3 copies of all dupes and over 500k of every resource. several mil of each ammo
---
The last part of this is what I don't think some people get most that are complaining about the drop rate probably won't even wear the mask a month or two from now anyway so does it really matter 
---
Have they clarified that "transferring characters" means transfers WITH stash and gear included? Because I thought they were essentially just letting you use your physical build, possibly level and perk loadout, but since so much of the gameplay is about gathering a specific resource or getting a certain objective, if you transfer with stash, wouldn't that just let you farm it on easy servers and then bring it over to survival?
---
It's better this way. Even if everyone had to start at zero, by the end of the first day some people would be way out ahead and it would get worse and worse. This way, at least you can work on your character in adventure and just bring it over. 
---
Yeah except that time period is going to be like 2 weeks. Its really not a big deal if characters transfer.
---
Yeah, I'm not feeling it. 
---
&gt;Griefers are going to use the no slap damage system to their advantage in the wost way
---
this is retarded. what kind of idiot golds this shit?
---
Okay, so my Camp is in a spot where I can pretty easily make sure nobody gets in. How much is survival time going to play into the leaderboards? I can see these mechanics being abused already.
---
That isn't to say I'm not extremely excited, I just expect the first few weeks might be frustrating.
---
Lol if someone else had even a 1% chance to get my armor/weapon I wouldn't play. That seems crazy in this casual of a game. 
---
TSE can easily be survived with any power armor and the fireproof perk. Everything has a counter. 
---
Same with me. I like the CAMP items too. I wish there were more of them (I'm sure they'll add more) and I didn't realize that some were rarer than others. I've found a few berets, I just play the game and take what the game gives me. Sometimes I'm lucky and find something cool, and sometimes I don't. I just figure if I play long enough I'll find all that I want. I'd be happier if they allowed more storage/building limits so I could collect the outfits/armor I find, or build bigger and cooler with the CAMP items too
---
Yeah, you're not worried because you got your five.
---
I think I may have encountered you online... GT seems familiar.
---
Survival is likely going to be a fresh start. 
---
&gt; For example, if you have pacifist mode disabled 
---
I don't understand, or did you misread?
---
Radbow.
---
The physical damage doesn't. The radiation damage ignores all of the armor and its perks. 
---
Or they fucked up again
---
This whole idea of PVE types and PVP types is kinda weird. There is a huge spectrum of crossover play from both sides. Pure pve/p players are pretty rare in my experience.
---
You don‚Äôt even get a reward for surviving though. You just get ‚Äúbragging rights‚Äù. That‚Äôs not a reward. You get nothing for surviving, except for not losing your caps. You actually get punished for surviving because if you‚Äôre in the top 3, everyone will know where you are on the map, and you will probably have a bounty placed on you after a while. If survival mode is going to work well, players have to create a new character in order for the entire server not to be full of the armor/weapon builds you mentioned. The only way to make a fair playing field is to make everyone come out of the vault again. This way, players can still help out other players in a quest or event, and then decide if they want to fight after the event.
---
THIS. THIS IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING. I took time off work for the release of survival mode. I'll be cancelling that time off if we can bring our current toons.
---
Dont shot him while he is dropping from the tree, let him land 
---
Yesterday I saw a guy using power armor but taking every single piece out but wearing a beret mask and walking between the bots just like them to celebrate the parade. That was gold 
---
i made thiss
---
PC ? XBOX ? PS4 ? 
---
Exactly this, I recently celebrated my 25th anniversary with my sweetheart, and we've never had an argument, because we are kind, considerate and loving to each other everyday.
---
My parents have always been my role models, they are approaching their 60th and still act like newlyweds.
---
They have said serveral times you will be able to bring your current character in survival
---
Not at level 3
---
Sorry, I've been grinding hard af for this game mode. This is all I've wanted to play since launch. Cry a river Elsweyr. 
---
Go for a non PA broadsider build. Or a six gun black powder rifle build with a revolutionary sword as back up. 
---
I wouldn't delete chars but give people an incentive to make new chars. If you don't you'll have a gear advantage but also won't get the season rewards.
---
Seasons add a lot of replay-ablilty to a game.
---
Shoot the ground next to them or them, then press the vats button immediately, a explosive round will briefly remove the chameleon effect and allow you to target them.
---
This sounded like an absolutely amazing (and creepy) encounter until you went to retrieve your death bag.  Then the encounter became annoying and griefing.
---
For the first half, I would have thoroughly enjoyed the encounter - the thrill, suspense, comedy and wonder of it all.
---
I agree with the point of being able to resupply in PvE - its kind of valid. At the same time I probably won't be doing that as I really value the possibility of shooting people I dislike (I wont KoS people on sight,  usually). I do believe that the solution to the problem of lack of rewards in PvP won't come from making the grind more complicated tho - I'd prefer some actual challange to contest. I do believe increasing the workshop output severely could do the trick as to provide PvP incentives. There is nothing for gangs to control right now and hence there are no real gangs nor in-game politics. 
---
I put my camp between Morgtown, I hope that‚Äôs how you spell it, and the junkyard that is also a workshop. Not a lot of traffic, but the occasional player every 10-15 minutes. 
---
I took a video last night of a dead hound giving me a golf clap. The kicker is that the insult bot was right there, but was glitching and wouldn‚Äôt give me any insults. I was trying desperately to get him to insult me and then pan over to the golf‚Äìclapping dog, But the bot kept on telling me to wait‚Ä¶
---
It's possible they didn't want people server hopping trying to get these items (due to the fact that it messes up the servers.) So in theory they could have programmed the event to not let you get a rare drop the first time you do the event on the server. Just a theory. Does this event start more often than other events? If you stay on one server is it possible your chance of getting a rare drop goes up? 
---
I agree but let‚Äôs face it, it doesn‚Äôt really matter if we all start from lvl 1 when a week from release there will already be people above lvl 100. I just can‚Äôt play 14 hours a day. My expectations are pretty low to be honest.
---
I believe the max, no matter how high you actually get it, is 99%.
---
If someone can tell me how to post a picture, I can post Officer 
---
Oh i don't.
---
It's me and all the people who left the game, who spammed it with hate wherever you look, who made this game so infamous. Meanwhile you'all stand there barking at chairs, bathing in the smell but refusing to do anything about it.
---
Me too, just 58 but I team up with old guys a lot.
---
It just occurred to me that unless they change this day one in front of vault 76 is going to look exactly like the intro to Fallout 2.
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean it will be. 
---
And that would be foolish if they WANT people to play it. I mean everyone would just god stomp anyway. No one is going to want to play if they die every second. 
---
On ps4 and you can have 1 for free. Psn same as here. Not on now but send a request and I'll get at you
---
I can't exactly find those names in english. So yeah. German. Google tilts if I search for translations. Is there a database to look that up?
---
So are the legendary rewards only available in Survival?
---
there is a post on the front page that breaks down how distribution of masks works in relation to remaining robots using datamined code.
---
epic gamer moment
---
That‚Äôs s good point. 
---
I totally get that some people play for the pleasure of collecting every thing in a game or what they think is cool.
---
I‚Äôm not even saying that kind of play is wrong.
---
But the general feeling I‚Äôm getting is people are making up all kinds of reasons why they are being screwed and how unfair it is. 
---
It‚Äôs not unfair. Games have always done this. The whole carrot and stick reward system. Games will always be fine like this. 
---
Not only what the other person said, but maybe my friends are in a different time zone, and dont often get to play. Especially when our play times dont always line up. And just because i get ANY chance to play at all, that doesnt mean i want to use my limited time for more grindy thingies.
---
Not even that interested in Survival, just, get off your ignorant high horse.
---
A sample size of over 5k has a margin of error of under 1.5% so this is plenty. The main flaw of this is it's a voluntary poll and it's not a random sample. 
---
I agree 100%!
---
When we get the Prestige system I think this will work a lot of these issues out. When people are reseting their level 234 characters and starting over it'll balance out the average level into something more "fair".
---
That's fine . I'm getting use out of it as a secondary
---
Oh hey it's this asshole again
---
I just beat them. So no.. I guess not.
---
I do not believe Initiate was removed.  Just more paint reward options added.
---
I'm wondering why they didn't add lederhosen and dirndl outfits to go with the event.
---
Fair enough 
---
Because the tears of all the Uber players that got their ass licked and lost their favorite weapon would raise the ocean levels faster than climate change.

Reddit is built on voting on opinions. People here have opinions, and they vote comments based on those opinions.  Pretty simple.
---
The fallout series has historically been single player, and this version introduced multi-player.  Are you surprised that most of the people here don't like the idea of PvP in a game that's never had PvP?
---
If you want people to agree with you, start your own PvP sub.  If I pop over there and talk about disliking PvP, you can downvote me to hell and I'll expect it, since it's obviously the wrong place to be.  Your situation is a little more nuanced, but not any less obvious once you understand the situation.
---
PvP will always be an underdog *in this sub*.  Not that there's anything wrong with PvP, just that this sub's *expected audience* won't like it.  It's just a fact you'll have to learn to live with.
---
As I read your post I was wondering how you kept its interest for so long. You‚Äôve had better luck than me getting it back!
---
id say a lil of both.. already been seeing alot of chatter about clans rolling in, think the first few days/weeks gonna be a bloodbath of kill on sight and people hunting anything and everything then it will mellow out a bit and get into clan wars and so on.. but with the add in of aid dropping as well i can see some solo players not on their game being farmed for meds.
---
It won‚Äôt. It only gets rid of slap damage. Which the worst griefers already bypass with workshops since you can see where the players are on the maps at all times.
---
ok
---
I'm just glad that the stupid ass "raiders" (aka griefers) won't get to do a damn thing to players, like myself, who prefer to stay in pacifist mode after they toss in the protection for camps
---
We should form an Old Farts Platoon....   Over 50 only.  
---
But isn't that the appeal of the mode?  Testing your build against others without limit.  Losing weapons / armor is a big risk, but nobody would play this mode then.
---
Seeya.  Say hi to the friend group.
---
What do you mean not at level 3?
---
Or don't go afk where people can build or just fast travel out 
---
In the few times that he‚Äôs done that for me. Everyone just melee‚Äôd him down until bloody mess kicks in out of combat. 
---
Late reply, but thanks! Glad I don't use mic, I would have been the biggest killjoy ever before I read this, lol. 
---
I think it‚Äôs completely random 
---
Look, the fan reaction at launch was very overblown. The game was very VERY flawed but going out of your way to call it trash/garbage was pointless. At the time, I was one of the minority that supported the game as I truly saw the potential it had. Over time, these people left and what remained were the people that stuck out and were critical of the game and wanted it to succeed (and some casual players that didn't care too much). I was one of the critical ones. During that period however, Bethesda made so many awful decisions, one after the other. It truly felt like they either didn't care or were incredibly incompetent. Today, most of the critical people have taken a break and most of the people that remain are new players that did not witness the atrocious launch and those who are casual, always loved the game and still enjoy it casually. 
---
I currently belong in the minority of people who are very critical of the game and don't like how it's given a pass by new/casual players when it clearly DOES NOT deserve it. This is a product Bethesda owes you. You payed for it. You are thanking them for releasing "free" new content when the base game itself is not even complete AND it's price dropped by a third right after launch (they basically owe the people that payed 60$ for it). 
---
Add to that the fact how the DLC being released is incredibly mediocre. Have you played any of the previous Fallouts? Have you used the creation engine? Do you know how easy it is to create a compelling mission? Yet they seem to struggle at even doing that. Heck a dungeon I made for Skyrim in two weeks is as entertaining as the latest event. I understand that they are fixing bugs in parallel but every single update, bugs are fixed, some resurface, some are created and some are thought to be fixed while they actually aren't. Now you can tell me BuGs ArE eXpEcTeD but if you've played literally any other survival game (even the buggy mess that was ARK), you'd realize how sub-par their work is.
---
TLDR: It's not okay to blindly hate but it's also not okay to not draw a line and have standards.
---
The first half of your post is how I play my clown character.
---
Never do the second though. Plus I'm not that high level, and I never wear masks.
---
I mean a level 3 character is not going to have access to either of those counters. 
---
Go read this weeks Inside the vault
---
That is exactly my point.
---
There needs to be risk, or what's the point.
---
You have a Bloodied VATS-VATS weapon, and you're dominating with it?
---
It should have a small chance to drop if you take your eye off the ball and die.
---
/u/Valseek /u/Ladydevann
---
Ahh yes, the old "toxic".  Grow up, manbaby.
---
The lighting is such a mixed bag and consistently inconsistent.
---
Outside during the day, the lighting generally looks really good. Volumetric lighting, smoke, fog, godrays all look really nice. The sun casts shadows on all exterior objects. They bumped up the ambient occlusion from Fallout 4, giving objects more depth in the environment. The terrible character rim lighting from Fallout 4 has been eliminated.
---
Interiors, on the other hand, are inconsistent and range from okay to terrible, much of it to do with lack of shadows from an ienumerable amount of light sources, and a lot of "fake" lighting used to illuminate interiors in general.
---
These issues were largely rectified in Fallout 4 via modding, and I hope to see the same thing in 76 at some point.
---
Hey I recognize my comment here ;)
---
As a not-op player who is still trying to even get enough gear to have 1 good build, making it a new start will make me just not play that mode.  Granted, I probably won't anyway because I don't want to lose every cap I own and their pvp penalty for engaging in it is absurdly high, but I also wouldn't want to start over.  
---
Maybe, they should balance things...  Though you'll see the meta build in that mode shift hard away from bloodied to stealthy 1 shot you from 2 miles away.
---
If you‚Äôre always following the meta, you‚Äôre behind, and you will never be in the top echelon of any game. I have learned that over many years of mmo‚Äôs. The trick is to stay ahead, learning what counters the current meta and how to overcome it. Because essentially if it‚Äôs the meta and you can counter it then you have a counter to a majority of opponents playstyle. 
---
Sentinel builds can easily be decimated by the following, vats crit headshot, high RoF weapon with tank killer or one gun army or any type of stagger perk, melee, throw a plasma grenade and shoot it in vats when it‚Äôs next to their head, +many more.
---
Honestly I‚Äôm tired of educating so many people on this sub about how to pvp, I‚Äôm probably just making my opponents better and making it harder for me to slaughter their non wanting to learn or find anything out themselves having asses, but I digress. 
---
They really need to fix it so that jumping/falling counts as moving and negates the sentinel buff. There's already legendary leg gear that has fall damage reduction and it's worthless because sentinel does the exact same thing, but more, as long as you don't move after jumping off a cliff.
---
It‚Äôs not sitting in the random locker anymore. 
---
Yeah, I get that, but after the first week or two, no new players will stand a chance of getting much done, everyone else will be so far above them that it will be pointless.
---
That was my view at first too, but I've decided that this way is just as good, if not better.
---
But you're happy enough to dominate people with lesser weapons and armor?
---
Where's the thrill? Where's the risk? Where's the consequence?
---
I have vendor characters &amp; do a lot of trading also
---
I agree that survival characters should be fresh starts, but how in the world are you disappointed? They said it'd be like this since they announced the game mode 
---
As far as i can see the only difference in each paint job is a little orange or red marker on the left arm. 
---
I‚Äôve made a few and here‚Äôs what I learned:
---
Near the overseers camp. You would think this is a great spot, but it‚Äôs not. You get more new players than anything else. They have very few caps, no grasp on how the trading system works, don‚Äôt know what they even need, etc. I had a lot of people walk in and right back out. 
---
Whitespring clubhouse. This has been my favorite site to set up shop, but unfortunately now you have to build a little farther away. Here you‚Äôll get plenty of experienced players that know how to trade. They‚Äôre there for legendaries most of the time so it‚Äôs a good place to unload good legendaries you find. This location is where I got the most amount of customers stopping by. 
---
Helvetia is where I‚Äôm set up currently and it‚Äôs great, on the road just west of the old man winter effigy. Tons of visitors after the Fasnacht event that will trade extra plans or masks. It‚Äôs easy to get a handful to follow you right after the event. 
---
My pro tip from one trader to another is advertise something for free just to get them trading. Use neon or small letters to spell out something like ‚Äúfirst plan free‚Äù or something on the wall by where you‚Äôre conducting business. Or list a low price in some way. My current shop says ‚ÄúAll plans 50 caps‚Äù and I‚Äôve never seen people leave so quickly. Changing it back to one free plan later today. 
---
[Watch the first minute or so of this video](https://youtu.be/-R8RE1_b0Mg) to see what the inside of my second shop looked like. Mainly just the window wall where I conduct business. It‚Äôs a window with vault tech posters in the outer two windows, then I sit in a chair on a desk behind the window. 
---
Glad you noticed my ID reflects my nickname of Bugsy. Though I haven‚Äôt been called that in about 30 years, it‚Äôs a good, unique ID.  I got it when I had to grow and take care of 5 million gallons of bacteria in my job. I was always checking on ‚Äúthe bugs‚Äù so the operators gave me the nickname.
---
Well I'm super excited for PvP! I did one Hunter Hunted and I'm hooked.
---
For the event period everybody is put in same team so no PvP during the event. Once the event finishes, area immidately turns into warzone. Some of the players are fleeting the scene as her hp drops to 2% to save their rewards.
---
I have found intestines on chicken too
---
Even with .03 drop rate, there should be more showing up.  Pretty sure they aren't dropping at all.  The people that say they have it provide no proof.
---
If we we're already told we can move our characters over there (as they did months ago) then changing it now would be shafting us.    
---
Fuck the new players.  Like every MMO it rewards the ones who put the most time and effort into it.  Don't like it? Go back to FO4 and toggle god mode 
---
So your arguement then is that there is a power difference between character of different levels? 
---
They are offering a permanent exp bonus so new characters can level up. And most people don‚Äôt want to start all over just to pvp. And even if they did who‚Äôs to say they can‚Äôt just transfer over their other weapons from their other characters
---
No it's not. Read the latest Inside the Vault.
---
It's even worse. The XP and progress they get in survival are reflected in Adventure mode.
---
I'll gladly follow. I can pass out Brahmin milk. I've got a Brahmin that tends to make quite a bit. 
---
Losing caps according to your level (BAD!!!)
---
Losing your junk (why?!?!)
---
Losing AID stuff?!?!? (I mean this hurts the most ?!)  
---
All those things  are going to keep me away from Survival mode imo, i don't like losing stuff in addition to getting rekt. They should have introduced a new Currency (PvP limited) that you can earn when you kill someone/ or lose when you die. And remove losing stuff and caps. You should only lose caps when you have bounty.
---
For the love of god Bethesda please.
---
No not at all. I just want the increased XP and odd weapon drops. That'll be the reason I play the new game mode. I enjoy the tension of getting popped at any moment though. 
---
No, fragmenting the player base is never a good idea. 
---
&gt; Survival should 100000% start out with everyone on an equal playing field
---
No matter how hard you try, you're only going to delay the inevitable. Some players will have more time to play, be better at trading and accumulating wealth or just be luckier than you.  
---
&gt; I am NOT looking forward to being 1-shotted over and over again
---
This isn't even an issue of "better" gear. A bloodied melee build could 1-shot you with *All Rise* and some 1‚óÜ Unyielding pieces. You should be asking Bethesda for better overall balance.
---
&gt; since the duping has been pretty much been squashed
---
It only takes one little bug or a code regression to bring back duping, a code regression has literally already happened that re-introduced a duping method.
---
You don't get any stat increase after 50. It works exactly as you described it, at least until legendary characters are a thing.
---
Nah, I don't think it's about "testing" anything.
---
It's supposed to be a more hardcore, more ruthless mode. But as it stands now, it's basically a mickey-waving contest.
---
What's the damn point?
---
In the Drunken Caboose how often would I get diarrhea? The name is kind of implying that I will.
---
Nah y'all should be forced to create new character so you have to start all over for that mode and not be able to come running in with your already God tier weapons and armor. That would make survival mode fair for everyone who decides to play on those servers
---
Ah ok I see. Now that I think about it, what you‚Äôre stating might be the only use most survival players find for most of these unique reward weapons, putting them on display in their camp as trophies. Thanks for giving me the idea :D.
---
If they wanted to catch dupers, there are 100% accurate ways to do that without resorting to tricks.  Other games already do it.  You have to set it up ahead of time, but once you do it's trivial to see who is duping and what items are duped.
---
I admire the look of the tin foil hat you've got, but it's safe to take it off for now ;-)
---
HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! You were ACTUALLY expecting Bethesda to do something good/fair/logical for the community!?!?!?!?! HAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!
---
Yep, it's this.
---
And oh how I would baste my meatballs in those salty, salty tears.
---
I‚Äôm certain I‚Äôve read more incomprehensible comments, but I can‚Äôt think of any.
---
minecraft factions
---
&gt; While we're at it, can the developers add proper shadowcasting to light sources. If nothing else, the Pipboy or power armor light should cast a shadow.
---
Performance says no. It would be trivial to make lights cast shadows, but game performance would tank, which is why they are used... lightly...
---
Keen on excavator shocks. Cost?
---
Seasons seems like the best way to do this, especially with scoreboards. Remember, this is their beta so let's give them feedback on it!
---
if it is just a rarity thing, these items are obscenely rare. there are ~4 supposed confirmed rare masks to have been seen in the wild so far. there have been *millions* of event runs. if we take just the users subscribed to this sub and each of them did 10 runs, that is ~1,739,000 runs. at .03%, we should have seen over 50k drops of rare masks. this is also an extremely conservative estimate, seeing as A) this sub hardly makes up the entirety of the player base, and B) a great number of people have done *way* more than 10 runs.
---
it is *extremely* unlikely that there are 50K masks out there and there have only been proof of ~4 sightings by people shared on all popular social media. if these things are actually dropping, there is either something wrong with the mechanic, or they are just stupid rare.
---
do your stats really keep increasing? I didn't know that.
---
Lmao
---
find a friend, and sell them a bobby pin for 1 cap
---
I've been using the in between time to load up on wood, wax, steins and intestines to try and see how fast I can complete the bots tasks in one go.
---
I'm also enjoying being able to drop extra ammo, gear, and plans right on the parade route and know people get use of them. 
---
What does this have to do with server stability?
---
Nice tan bro
---
Pics?
---
Just sell something to a vendor instead ?
---
I would prefer vehicles or transit systems (trains, the monorail, bot-driven buses) that you would have to complete quest lines to learn plans to repair (using your mats), which would break down eventually and require further repair.
---
Perks could be added to decrease the number of materials required for repair, increase the duration of reliable transit, etc.
---
Some of the means of travel could even become workshops, which other players could also use for a certain price.  The player owning the transit system at the time receives a portion of the fees gathered.  So Player A could repair and place in service a train between Sutton and Grafton, and Player B could own the leg between Sutton and Charleston.  
---
PvP mode:  Contest at will.
---
Butterfly mode:  Station leg is operable for X period of time depending on perks of owner.
---
I skimmed 
---
&gt; The reality is that Survival should be starting from scratch,
---
Most people don't want to start from scratch
---
so you get your kill and immediately server hop to adventure mode?  does the bounty go with you if you come back to Survival?
---
Seriously. My favorite moments of the game are defending workshops from people. I can't wait to hunt people now.
---
You can never do the scorchbeast queen on survival it be impossible.... I believe that's why they're doing this
---
Everyone doesn't need to play and be amazing at Survival either. Nothing wrong with game modes that are better suited for certain player subsets.
---
Because everyone wants to be dropped in 2 seconds from a surprise exploding shotgun attack and lose everything they‚Äôve collected the first time they‚Äôve played. Good idea. 
---
Agreed. 
---
When/ if they add private servers, they need to be separate characters too.
---
44 and lvl 190
---
You might as well have not even responded. Care to provide context? Just a little, so I know wtf you‚Äôre talking about lol. What post? What did they say? I didn‚Äôt see it, and there is obvious risk the second you login someone could blow your head off, argue against that please indulge me.
---
lol, I think someone has Ezmar too, it didn‚Äôt tell me the account didn‚Äôt exist. I‚Äôll add you but I likely won‚Äôt be on until tomorrow afternoon/evening, PST
---
Nothing in life is fair. I spent my time after I got off work 1-2 hours at a time.  I am finally satisfied with my character after playing since November.  I didn‚Äôt rush, or dupe I played my way. If I like pvp and wanna switch it sucks I can‚Äôt have the character I put my time and effort into to not transfer over.
---
Vat crits don't work to ignore sentinel armor anymore. Bethesda patched that so thank for the education sorry to try and have a normal conversation with out it being a pissing contest. 
---
True. Wasn't thinking about that. 
---
You think devs who refuse to deliver what people paid for would bother with servers of a good quality? Bad servers, bad server stability.
---
I feel the exact same way. I'd also like to add they're really ugly masks that do absolutely nothing that almost no one will be wearing after this event. Of course I still want them. But if it's not a mod for a 4th claw on my deathclaw gauntlet or a or a jetpack I can wear without power armor it doesn't change my game play even a little bit. 
---
Maybe.. But Fasnacht is getting the traction it is simply because its a limited time thing, with very limited items, otherwise youre not seeing people do things like that. 
---
Your idea is fair enough, but even after a week or so, unless theres some sort of "legendary" feature as youve suggested, it would likely die down.
---
Also, 150 steel and 200 wood can be pissed out by most players alone. If its something as you suggest, it needs to be more like 600 and 1000. Just a suggestion.
---
They could transfer their weapons and armor over to the new character anyway. And on top of that lvl 300 people will drop probably around 600 caps when they die anyway
---
Well going to a .38 from a .45 in real life would be considered a damage drop so....... I always thought it was just for low level enemies but I never looked at the specs for the mod so......lol.
---
Yes it does there is no slap damage in adventure
---
Oh my god, thank you so much. I was worried because I'm level 34 and my SPECIAL stats are HORRIBLY planned. Great to know.
---
And so the Outcasts began to form
---
Your point is irrelevant because no one will want to play with your ‚Äúpoint‚Äù. 
---
A compromise option would be that your character can only switch modes if that character was created on or after the release of Survival mode. I can see the merit in building up a character in Adventure before "graduating" to Survival, but letting everybody put their current characters in is creating a playing field that will never have any sense of balance.
---
I agree that bragging rights is not incentive enough for the leaderboard. Maybe it can act as a sort of multiplier - the higher up you are, the better your rewards and XP, or you get more challenge credit towards that week's legendary weapon. I think this can also be balanced by giving a player better rewards depending on how high their target was on the leaderboards. Players have an incentive to climb, but there's also more of a target on their backs.
---
I actually like the wanted system. It sounds to me like the killed player is actually sponsoring the bounty in this case. What would be really cool is if we could set those bounties - nobody's really going to go after the guy with 15 caps, but 1000? That could create some pretty dynamic player-generated events. I'd like to see bounties tied to the player rather than the server too, so you can't just server hop when someone puts a bounty on you to clear it. 
---
Did I miss something? Is it now only new character?
---
Found all of that... only \*too late\* :(
---
&gt; The XP and progress they get in survival are reflected in Adventure mode
---
Won't matter in adventure mode. 
---
The community has been clear on one thing, and that is the need to separate PVP from PVE worlds.
---
People want to play PVE casually without the threat other players represent to them or their camps.
---
Well, tough. I hope Bethesda changes their minds and forces anyone who wants to try out survival mode to create a whole new character.
---
The point of workshops is to be for PvP and to fight over the resources.
---
Why not have a craft item allowing us to combine multiple cores into one‚Ä¶
---
I actually did have voice chat on but he wasn't talking back to me
---
Seasons. Problem solved.
---
That's an interesting thought. I'd be interested to see how the game would change without legendaries. On one hand, some of the more OP builds would be weaker. However, builds that rely on weapons that are only competitive after legendary effects would fall out of favor.
---
So basically you downvoted me then proceeded to reiterate everything I just said? Wow aren‚Äôt you some kind of special.
---
There is a guy on PS4 that has them all and does Paint Jobs for anyones T-60 for a small fee.  The Elder Paint he did for me is fantastic looking
---
7 whole dollars? last time i traded in a game they gave me an IOU for 1/3rd of a penny
---
Cool thats what i want. Pvp. Ive got too much caps and junk from farming players.
---
I think this is basically where I am. Haven't stopped thinking about it since it happened and the good parts just about outweigh the bad parts I think.
---
Waste of time and $$$$$. Maybe you should have, ya know, actually put some thought into the main game in the first place .......
---
Bethesda, please ignore the above request. 
---
Lol it‚Äôs not patched, I just got 1 shotted a couple days ago, and I was just 1 shotting sentinel assassin guys last night. Nice try though.
---
I joined an event for Sheepsquatch horde event last nigh that immediately changed to "defeat the Sheepsquatch horde boss" when I got there and when I ran it down it was a wolf horde. I'm guessing that when they activate the Sheepsquatch events they will randomly replace a certain number of normally occurring hordes with them. They probably just didn't think to disable the process that is picking hordes to replace when they inactivated whatever code brings the Sheepsquatch to life until they're ready. Bummer though, I was excited to find one. Although the wolf boss did drop a level 10 exploding quad ammo pipe rifle that I can give to my new alt, so not all bad. 
---
just had to bring race into didnt you i think there probably no life jerks but your the raciest
---
My experience as well.
---
Lol nah. Y'all should be forced to create new characters for it
---
It's a learning experience for most of us when we first start. ;)
---
I see so many of these.  All it will do is punish the more casual players.  The Uber elite Epeen crowd will be back up and running in a week or less.  
---
Cool so no one should ever listen to this subs opinion on PvP matters. 
---
I completely agree!
---
Ok, then refund me 200 hours of time I spent on developing my character and farming. 
---
Tripe. Don't even attempt to tell me that a 20% XP bonus is your reason. The unique weapons will be obtainable by people who drop in once per week from Adventure for an hour or two to do the weekly.
---
There's no "tension" either, because there's literally no consequence to getting popped. You don't carry junk, and I am sure the loss of some stimpacks or some junk aid item is not going to hurt.
---
The idea in general was good.
---
Allowing fully developed toons into it from the get-go is a HORRIFIC idea. It basically builds a barrier to ALL new players, plus ALL current players who don't have the "uber" gear.
---
44 and level 179. Never teamed up, always solo.
---
Lmfaooooo. I look forward to it coming out and hearing lots of you bitch about how unfair it is :)
---
Are they trolling us with this? All of these adjustments make me want to quit the game. I'm 100% out when the pacifist camp bs comes in. The WASTELAND is becoming a nice, safe, everybody gets a trophy libland.
---
True! I came across one that was playing some weird, haunting music.
---
What does it matter? If you were to start up a month or two after Survival releases, you'd be in the same boat. If you got your stuff legit, then it shouldn't matter. Without knowing more, it's hard to tell if this mode will just be a mess. What if cheating is prevalent in Survival, whether in the beginning or at any point? You'd again be faced with this same problem, just with having to dump more and more time into this game by having to restart. I guess we'll have to wait and see how it's executed. I'm happy with the way things are now, and having put so much time into this game already, I may just be ready to move onto another game for awhile anyway. 
---
How about a permadeath? If you die, you drop everything and your character's deactivated, just like diablo 2 hardcore mode. I mean, why not? No one's gonna play but who cares? IMMERSION
---
We got Unitymedia.. but we play on PS4. We have some disconnections but nothing on the lines of "logged in from another device".  
---
Is it PC only?  
---
Question: Do we know if there will be any other changes to Survival mode other than the PVP? I was looking forward to starting a new character and having a more difficult survival-based experience, but now I realize I was thinking in terms of Fallout 4's survival mode... Like, do we even know basic stuff, like if fast travel will be enabled or not?
---
How does it increase what griefers can do? what option dot they have now that they didn't before? really looking forward to this response. 
---
They did it in 3 and New Vegas, no reason it couldn't have been done in 4 and 76.
---
I'll be honest, this one just feels like laziness on behalf of bethesda.
---
True, I agree with you on most points. I was just throwing out numbers for requirements. The harder the better imo. And not just simple things like wood and steel but other scraps too. 
---
And it would absolutely have to have some incentive like items you can only buy thru those vendors. If there were camp items and gear you could get no where else people would definitely do it. People still make posts about holding Grahm or the Charleston vendor because hes hard to find. These vendors would be special too, not hard to find hut hard to rebuild the town to make them show up. 
---
I disagree to an extent.
---
Some people want to be collectors.  Some people like to 100% games.  Some are both.  Why make a reward, something that people can collect, but give *everyone* (for all practical purposes) 0% chance of completing the collection?
---
I'll go with low odds, as long as you can keep trying (I farmed the hunter's Long Coat for instance).  But this situation is time-limited, and effectively 0% chance of getting one reward, much less all of them, and then it goes away.  Get insanely, lotto-level lucky, or don't complete your goal.  That is just plain wrong.
---
Yes I am aware. But I think everyone agrees that the way it‚Äôs working now is not ideal in any way. It‚Äôs not a fight over resources, it‚Äôs easy wanted free killing half way across the map. 
---
If you post what platform your are on: PS4, XB1 or PC with your GT name people will look you up.
---
I'm on XB1 GT k9mpsgt look me up if you are on this platform, would be happy to roam around with you.
---
2 modes for Survival. Seasonal and one that never resets. As seasons end, Seasonal characters are "retired" to "Regular Survival" when Seasons end. Rinse repeat forever. Couldn't be simpler.
---
Here‚Äôs My Tally Mark: l
---
Yup several times. Not often though.

I go naked and headless, wielding a combat knife. Built my base close by so I celebrate the closing of the festivities with an artillery strike on old man winter. While I‚Äôm at work or sleeping, I‚Äôll AFK on top of the church. Any duplicate plans or masks I get, I give away to anyone that wants them. 
---
Oh god here we go again.  Who cares.  lol.  It's just a few little weekly quests to get some legendary weapons to take back over to adventure.  You wont show up on the map, griefers wont be able to just find you randomly and stalk you all over.  You're exagerating the situation.  Stop making me do this all the time.  Just talk about faschnat masks or soemthing
---
ive only done it 4 times. Every time had all robots survive...but i wonder if how many people involved have something to do with it.
---
I got a decent drop when i did it with three players only and had recieved the same mask 3 times when theres 10 players+
---
D2 HC is surprisingly active :)
---
But nevertheless, there's a very big gap between my suggestion and your sarky little comment. 
---
The clutter is spot on! Nice job man! 
---
Hey buddy. 
---
Fasnacht Donuts!
---
For example if you stayed on one server and did the event every hour instead of server hopping?
---
I stayed on one server the first night, no hopping, and did it 5 or 6 times.  There were no apparent differences.  6pm to just past midnight.  6 hours straight gameplay.  Seems excessive if it were tied to something more than that.  
---
It‚Äôs also overflowing with blast zone plants, even though it hasn‚Äôt been nuked

[Yes](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3sidh/bethesda_please_do_not_allow_the_transfer_of/ej2du0k/?st=jtj2d68q&amp;sh=c4a3a44f)

Got all the decor plans and redid my camp with them for a Fasnacht vibe. 
---
Oof i completely forgot that. I‚Äôm on PC. I‚Äôll add it to my post. Thank you!!
---
It does the opposite. It allows people to get decent equipment in a much safer environment before they go into full PvP. 
---
Within a week the "super" players will have the best gear again and be able to stomp on any new players trying it out.
---
&gt; tons of diseased eyebots.
---
Good thing I just got a 3* TS Visine Syringer
---
I just talk in the mike if someone helps me out or if I accidentally shot someone in the face when they scare me.  Works ok but I think that's because I'm a woman.  The game is so much better with a team, but I think that's because there's someone to laugh at me cracking jokes.

In case you're on FB, it's for Xbox, PC , and PS4 mature folks.
---
Seem that a few times as well. I assumed it was previously blasted but the plants stayed active on a glitch. 
---
Ive done it about 6 tines ad only had the ‚Äòfreeze‚Äô after death issue once. That said, I had no idea about a workaround
---
I've been noticing it also.  I was seeing a little bit of it after patch 6.  I think it started after they did a stability maintenance between patches 6 and 7 but it got much, much worse with patch 7.  It's so bad that when I spawn in at my camp I can't move for 5 to 10 seconds usually. 
---
Today, on American Pickers, Mike and Frank visit post-war Appalachia! Bring your RadAway for the hot deals!
---
And I agree 100% with this. I am one of the players who will stick to PvE.
---
But the idea that the dev team pour resources into another game mode (which could have been great) and then allow it to be polluted from the get-go is fucking frustrating.
---
Those resources could have gone to more content.
---
I think the decision to let developed chars play this mode is wrong.
---
What do you think forcing new characters is going to accomplish? As long as there is player trading you could just move existing gear over to a new character anyway so I don‚Äôt understand your reasoning. You want to force people to level up another character just because?
---
They have the option of toggling the ability to take damage from other players off. Which increases their options of making other players lives more difficult without fear of reprisal.
---
They won't though, because with no transfer option there won't be the thousands of duped AAE/BE weapons or sentinel/assassin's armor. These items are rare af and 99% of people that have them wouldn't - if it wasn't for all the duping. 
---
Forget that. Not everyone has the luxury of being able to take time off of work just to grind a character for hours on end.
---
If they *don‚Äôt* let us transfer characters, I won‚Äôt be trying it out.
---
This is idiotic. This is no longer beta where you can just make someones progression 0, this is release. I am not interested in doing all the quests and SBQs again. This is slap to everyone who spent hundreds of hours playing since day one. Message it sends is that there is no point playing now. Start playing in 5 years when all the modes have rolled out, because when you play now, they are going to release now mode and all your progression has been pointless.
---
I actually checked and the door was closed in my case. Then I got out for the trip and came back to find that someone got in and took the plan while i'm looking for the keys. After that, I just hop 2 more server and found that the bunker door is closed, used my key and take the plan. Maybe its so new that everyone's hunting it. Get the dome key they server hop to find a fresh bunker. That's that easy.
---
Ahh I rarely check, ty. Damn is it ugly lol.
---
HA ha ha ha
---
No I have a mix of vanguard bos armor. Swing and a miss.
---
They drop random aid. 
---
 - My question is ... Do we drop the whole stack? If i have 25 stimpacks... Do i drop all 25? 
---
was it stuff you cant make yourself? things others made while in a party in your camp? i know things placed in your camp by someone else doesnt move with you. 
---
Yup all lvl 1 legendaries the one time it happened for me. Awesome score for the newbies I dump them on. Worthless for me lol
---
Right on, i wasn't exactly sure how it worked.
---
I probably won't bitch. I'm used to other games losing literally everything on your body so losing a few stimpaks or Radaway isn't going to bother me. I can server hop or switch back over to Adventure mode. Games like ARMA (Epoch) &amp; GTAOnline are much harsher in terms of death penalties and I love those games. 
---
Again, you weren't talking about "laag" you were talking about a fabric bag so kindly pull your head out of your ass. You're trying to sound metaphorical and smart but you sound like an idiot. If you think you had any part in making this game "infamous" you need a reality check. Bethesda made the game infamous due to the state it was released in. I personally only experience lag upon loading in the world. I've adjusted by just making sure I take a couple dabs before I move anywhere. Problem solved. For me at least. 
---
I agree, I was a little upset at times with the game and more than a few, I am done with this game moments, but I am glad I stuck with it, because Bethesda did work hard to address and correct those problems and have created a game that I really do enjoy.  Playing the Division 2 over the weekend actually made me appreciate the game more.  While both games are better or easier playing with others, Fallout is less dependent on it and easier to play with lower lever characters, and to meet people in game.   I know they are two different games and hard to compare one to the other and maybe the division will evolve the way fallout did into a better game, but it did give me a new respect for what Bethesda has built and while my first character is lvl 110 and I will continue to play that character, last night I created a new character so I could experience the game from the beginning again.  
---
I normally like playing games alone and the solidarity of the wasteland is something that I enjoy, so I agree thank you Bethesda for the hard work you have put in.  
---
I know its an old conversation, but yeah i got a dupe yesterday, hopefully today will be different.
---
hehehe i mini-nuked the heck out of em yesterday, didn no damage to anyone, but it was fun to do regardless
---
F#ck this sh#t. Go play 100 levels adventure mode, gear up and then join survival mode. Problem solved.
---
Why don‚Äôt you buy the serums from someone?
---
Agreed. That very thing happens with FPS games with significantly smaller maps. Some areas just become the spot where fighting happens.
---
What platform are you on? I sell the serum for 250 each on PS4 
---
Out of curiousity, would you be willing to offer them to other players too? I can give you some plans in exchange, I have quite a few sitting around, like Light Boxes and such. I've been on a mission to complete my CAMP plans, but there are some that have eluded me so far!
---
Whattttttt?    How many people do you think are playing this game?  Just give it a break at least until we have tried it.  I really think you guys are blowing this out of proportion lol.
---
Yikes 
---
I smash all the bases near the parade then nuke it.
---
Can you explain?
---
Had around 10 or more crashes now during the event. Hasn‚Äôt kept me from bustin back in on a new one though!
---
I can‚Äôt find my decorations in the build menus? I have ‚Äúread‚Äù my plans for a ribbon stand and flag but can‚Äôt find them anywhere? Any suggestions?
---
It's irrelevant to YOU.
---
Many games have difficult modes - D2 was brought up earlier in the thread as an example with Hardcore....that is permadeath.
---
Sounds shit to you, right? With your full suit of massive-penis armor?
---
It's massively popular still, and the game is 20 years old.
---
Just because you can't handle it, or envision it, doesn't mean that others wouldn't accept it.
---
What is UNACCEPTABLE is letting you "pvp-gods" into a new mode with all your accoutrements without starting you fresh.
---
If this was the case, would you still be so brave?
---
I doubt it.
---
As a non-PVPer, there's a HUGE reason why letting people hop back-and-forth is a terrible idea:  The Legendary Weapon prizes.  Letting those into the PVE environment would be an intensely bad design choice - huge imbalances will come from it.
---
Sure, if anyone in WV knew what they were. The WV BoS peeps from vault 76 do not even have that much information to go off of in regards to what the BoS really is. It isn't like there is a copy of the codex laying around. There isn't even a full rank structure written anywhere to find.
---
No damage huh? Hmm, won‚Äôt work for me. I‚Äôve been a good guy for 300 hours. I wanna cause a little destruction. 
---
Sounds like adventure is what‚Äôs designed for you mayne, this subreddits vocal minority is gonna thin this game and it‚Äôs sad üòÇ ‚ÄúGet PvPers our of our servers make them carebear‚Äù Beth makes Survival mode knocks slap damage to zero ‚ÄúI want to impose my will on the PvP server now as well‚Äù like no ones making you go there, don‚Äôt like the rules just like, don‚Äôt play the mode?
---
I think fast travel is alright but everything else can fuck right off
---
User name checks out 
---
Also works if it just decomposes to a meat pile.
---
r/market76 has people constantly selling for 200-300 a serum. 
---
On xbox? I sell serums 150 each, buy 4 or more 100 caps each. Gt: watchmefly420 I'll be on late tonight.
---
Done the event three times and hasn't glitched for me yet.
---
IMO, starting a new character with a completely new play-style is more fun than playing a finished or nearly finished character. I find games most fun when I play with a goal in mind. With a finished character you eventually run out of goals that are engaging enough to keep you coming back. Sure you can grind dailies, but they rely on skinner box mechanics that feel unrewarding aft a while.
---
for real I planned on returning for survival but if its not gonna be a fresh start im out
---
Farming in adventure wouldn‚Äôt affect players that‚Äùwant nothing to do with PvP.‚Äù
---
No, I get that.
---
But new mode, new challenge, new rules.
---
The ones who will take this challenge on will be the ones who make the mode worth playing.
---
The ones who drop in with their "lol-leet" armor and weapons will be the ones who kill it.
---
Not to mention, it would be a near waste of time for these higher level players to pick on lower level players. 
---
Add on top of that, other high level players using low level players as ambush bait? Wait for some prick to come picking on a low level and get an open shot while he's distracted. 
---
Not my fault those players didn't start playing day 1. Why the f#ck should players who started playing day 1 be the ones who get penalized for being in there day one.  
---
My dad sent me a screen shot when he was a lower level; some guy found his camp and was staring at him through the windows. Every time he closed the shutters, this guy opened them again. This guy eventually Power Armor clipped through his wall and ended up killing him. 
---
For sure!
---
I don't want anything for them, don't worry.
---
If you play on PC, add me: EggrFegegr
---
Also the thing I'm talking about that patch was vats crits with auto weapons. There was a post on it a few days back and it's somewhere in the patch notes.  
---
same issue ive had every time its so fucking annoying 
---
Yes! Which I mention above. However server hopping generally means you don't want to wait for this to occur. Bloody mess is faster and can help everyone in the area out!
---
You can pick mutations up super cheaply (200 or less), depending on platform and where you look.
---
Id enjoy something like that. And just to add to that idea (you saying "hard to rebuild" sparked it), but maybe building the town can be an event, that once completed, houses the vendors and lasts for a few hours as you suggested, but the end of that timer can also be an event. On servers where the town (and server) has lasted that long, an event would start to protect it. Similar to defending a workshop, but available (and announced) to everyone in the server, and WAY harder. Like a SBQ battle, but with a different (maybe new) giant enemy/batch of enemies. Just like you can summon the SBQ but fail the event and have her fly off, failing the event ends with the town being returned to its demolished state, whereas a success will reset the counter on the towns existence without the need for supplies. And of course yeilding its own unique rewards. Again, just a thought.
---
Floor, wall, and misc decor are all the tabs for new items.
---
Xbox, on now, 150/each
---
Same gt as here
---
It needs to be gone altogether in adventure mode.
---
Usually means the nuke zone just recently cleared out.  Also seems to be when the level 1 eyebot thing tends to happen.
---
Let me ask you this; In WoW or any other rpg. If they made a new server for people to play the game on a harder difficulty (and allowed full PVP) would you let players take their existing character; or would you make them start from scratch so no one has an advantage from the get-go?
---
The people that have spent 200+ hours grinding armors, mutations and legendary weapons should be allowed to have fun and square off in a system that is more friendly and conducive to PVP than what exists in the current game mode.  
---
Let them have fun. 
---
Like you I won't be in the PVP servers but I don't begrudge those high level characters their fun.
---
I plan on dropping an orbital strike beacon when someone kills me. I guess that counts as a weapon... 
---
I do indeed play on PC! My username on Fallout is the same as my username on here, I'm logging on to add you right now! (And thank you so, so much!)
---
Ive pvpd a hand full of times and haven't had any problems with being overpowered or out gunned. As a matter a fact I think I've only lost one encounter and my character is pretty average.
---
Are you just riding the hate dick or have you personally struggled with pvp during travels?
---
No, it is actually different modes. It will be far more difficult to min max on survival than adventure.
---
Moving a character from adventure with max level gear tuned for pvp and fighting someone coming right out of the vault is only ending one way early into the mode.
---
They need a blank slate PvP mode without legendaries, as was said in previous posts
---
I can't believe I didn't consider this! A faction system (Perhaps based around ingame factions, or player created) would make PVP so much more meaningful.
---
Do you still have fusion cores and flux still left?
---
Low health HW/explosives build. You can still face tank stuff to a degree (emergency protocols really helps here) and you get a ton of different toys to play with (have you SEEN the number and variety of heavy weapons?!) and with a low health build, explosives are actually powerful. Plus you don‚Äôt have to be a sneaky sniper.
---
Downside for some folks is they hate power armor, and it‚Äôs kind of required. But I love the build!
---

---
There‚Äôs a lot of flexibility with the SPECIAL allocation, certainly in Luck you can swap a bunch around, like Serendipity for defensivenesss, Luck of the draw for weapon repair, mutation perks like starched genes and class freak (I don‚Äôt run them on my combat loadout because I don‚Äôt care about the negatives from mutations in my combat loadout, I actually like the chem effectiveness reduction of Healing Factor so I can better manage rads/health values with diluted rad-aways, and you don‚Äôt take much rad damage in power armor so starched genes are only needed when out of PA or when using rad-away)
---
There‚Äôs a lot of flexibility all over really, this is just the max-damage setup. Also I use Tenderizer and one other random 1star charisma perk, because I‚Äôm always grouped. 
---
I didn't downvote you. I can give you one if you want tho
---
Well, nobody knows, but is it a problem either way?
---
I mean, there is no aid item in the game which is hard to farm.
---
I love when that happens. You can totally pimp out some lvl 2 newbie. Makes my day everytime.
---
No, it's just an unpopular opinion with the general population here, so expect downvotes.  That doesn't mean the PvP community doesn't have a place, or shouldn't be heard.  Just don't let the downvotes sour your attitude.  It's *safe* to be in the minority here, it's just not popular.
---
Please... I'm all for this. I want to get back into the game, and this is the perfect opportunity to
---
How many fusion cores and flux you after? Also what flux? 
---
I suppose, though players could still dip into adventure mode to repair their stuff.
---
How is it any different from ESO? You farm in PVE environment and then go into PVP environment. 
---
It's the nuka cola quantum paint, got released during the last update. If you search for it on Google you'll find loads of reddit posts and YouTube videos 
---
Yeah and if there‚Äôs another 100 posts like this, it still does mean nothing. The people in this sub have to understand that they are the fucking minority of the FO76 community. I hope Bethesda sticks with their plans and doesn‚Äôt listen to a couple of hundred people who are complaining about this in here.
---
&gt;They can't have you type the code before swiping the keycard or something to prevent this?
---
Well, that would defeat the purpose of consuming the keycard on inputting the wrong code.
---
Just bring a couple keycards just in case.  They are easy to get, not like they weigh a lot.
---
I don‚Äôt have any of the flux left I forgot lol 
---
Isn't that the Mothman paint?
---
Probably the new quantum paint
---
This comment deserves more attention. I really like your idea. Have you made a post about it yet?
---
It was probably the X-01 Nuka Cola Quantum paint job. Lots of guides online about how to obtain it.  
---
See here's where people are getting it wrong. You would be at a disadvantage against people dozens of levels above you, sure. Those players however are going to waste their time hunting down low level players for what? Paltry rewards and no movement on the leaderboard?
---
Making everyone start fresh creates an inevitable cycle of griefing. Everyone would just be picking on people a few levels lower than themselves. Allowing transfer of characters gives players of all levels space, as higher levels aren't going to be hanging around the forest for no rewards. 
---
Hard lesson learned for all of us once.
---
Take your time entering the code, theres a backspace button on the pad too. Theres no rush at that point because the silo becomes dormant.
---
Or you could type the code in right
---
Probably the nuka cola quantum paint. X01+ that paint and  Owl mask looks so damn cool. 
---
Since no two pieces I have are the same, IDK about stacking.  
---
The long story/anecdotal evidence is:
---
IIRC in at least one other in the FO series, you needed a complete set for the armor effect to apply....  
---
so I was trying to patiently wait to acquire other pieces.  Wasn't happening, so for a lark, I put on the chameleon arm.  
---
Poof, disappeared when I crouched (and stayed still). 
---
Moving in any direction while crouched lights me up until I stop moving.  
---
I can, however, rotate without becoming visible.  
---
Then I added the cloaking chest piece - noticed I was occasionally disappearing during melee.
---
I believe while crouched, I can swing the weapon and remain invisible, but I could be wrong (I'm too busy fighting).  I've only recenty begun crouching on top of an object while meleeing the bloated one groups.  The machete apparently reaches farther than their arm, so I can hit them consistently, but it seems they have a harder time hitting me - including a few that start to roam away (like they think I'm no longer there, so they leave) until I stand up, then they come back.
---
Based on that observation/anectdotal evidence.... 
---
I put on the other mismatched pieces - Given those are reduced damage from specific critters, (therefor, no  visual cue), and DR increases when you level up, I can only assume the reduced damage bonus effect is working.
---
Also IIRC, all the armor I have is less than L25.
---
Eh, yes, this is one of the main points.
---
They should not be able to switch modes either.
---
I mean, in any other game that has a hardcode mode, I can't grind gear in soft mode and then be a monster in hard mode, right?
---
So what you are saying is that it's fine, as long as people spend x-hundred hours grinding gear first.
---
Right?
---
But look at it from the perspective of those who have but 800+ hours into the game and now they cant play this new content without throwing all that away? 
---
Exactly. Notice the gap between dropping some aids and dropping a gear that you are actually using. People will never walk around in their best gears and survival mode's gonna be nothing but a joke
---
Thank you for letting us know however, with the utmost respect, I am going to call bullshit on this one.
---
Not from you but from whoever spewed this.
---
The account that was banned had less items than the average.
---
As a matter of fact I did not try to get around the arbitrarily imposed limitations, I did not try to circumvent them even though none of what was deleted were ill-gotten gains but the result of hundreds of hours of grinding.
---
If I would have taken the time to level those characters and apply the relevant weight reduction perks they would have been all well below the limit. In fact only one toon was above the limit, the rest were below and 3 out of 5 fast-travel worthy.
---
Shame on me really. Shame because I should have known better. Shame because what one gets for being a good little doggy to an abusive master is more abuse. Shame.
---
That's a pretty neat concept too. It's almost similar to that event that pops up where you turn on the satellite dishes, kill the enemies, and then it gets blown up. Just sorta in reverse with actual damage done.  I can not remember the name. But I'd take any kind of event that makes the server come together like fasnacht does. It has been so fun to actually work together with people. 
---
Can you trade painted armor? I tried giving a set ox X-1 with the camp paint from the store. I couldn‚Äôt trade it. 
---
No I wouldn‚Äôt even play it because I‚Äôm not throwing my hard work away for a system that is at best ‚Äúfinicky‚Äù. 
---
It‚Äôs like taking my 2018 Dodge Challenger that I‚Äôv modded for the last year and bringing into a demolition derby. Not worth it bud. 
---
I think the quick-fix will be underwhelming. The rest all seem cool.
---
The game is better with a team! One of my favorite memories was raiding the ammo factory when I was a low level with a bunch of other low levels. We got wrecked by auto turrets, the flare thing that calls in the roving heli with guns and the solo player in a full power armor suit wrecking us. Even tho it wasn‚Äôt successful I had fun. 
---
Yes. Everyone creates new characters.... And you create a constant cycle of griefing players just a few levels below you.
---
You wouldn't be playing a survival mode in fallout for hours. You'd be playing a bloodbath of respawns in the forest for weeks. 
---
&gt; The ones who drop in with their "lol-leet" armor and weapons will be the ones who kill it.
---
Yeah, ass hats will congregate over there for sure. 
---
But hopefully the good higher levels  will take them out. Part of me feels like they true grievers will not enjoy the Survival Mode because the people there will shoot back with wicked weapons.
---
Any type of flux and as many cores as I can afford also I have nuclear keycards if your still looking for them. I won't be on until tomorrow afternoon though my wife's at hospital she just gave birth so they may be expired by then but there yours if u want them.
---
I assume it is the quantum x01 pa paint, light blueish ?

That's really cool. Feels very authentic.

That is exactly what I was trying to say!!!!!!!!!
---
Survival will be nothing but a joke anyhow. THere'll be a week or two of posts which will probably include phrases like "topkek" and then.....nothing.
---
It'll die.
---
The "uber" will get bored and move on, and there'll never have been any incentive for the new players to drive it.
---
It's a fucking disaster of a decision.
---
Nope that‚Äôs not it 
---
I think that it's would be Ok to create survival-only characters (and later - "Nuclear Winter"-only characters etc.), with special servers for them. But the main character also should have the access to all game modes. Personally I don't want to create a new character for every game mode - don't have time for it.
---
I'd play this.
---
Even "reduces damage done by players" or "reduces damage taken while standing still" on assassin / sentinel? That's pretty nifty if so. 
---
Exactly. This "Lets lock" characters is only favorable to new players and is "F#ck you!" to players who were here in day one or been active trying to get best armor. 
---
You‚Äôre crazy. Like I want to lose one on my hard earned weapons to someone who‚Äôs been rocking a duped tse weapon from the start and always plays with two other guys just like him. You‚Äôre telling me you‚Äôd be cool with losing your go-to weapon you‚Äôve been using for a dozen or more levels possibly the first time you died in this mode? You‚Äôre not being sensible. 
---
Possibly what does it look like 
---
This is interesting. I assume it's close enough to the map marker that it is a free travel?
---
heh.
---
That perk man :)
---
I have seen the mini nukes rain down as well. Thankfully they were using pacifist
---
But all that time will have been wasted. No one in my group is ok with losing that to play new content.
---
I feel asleep in party chat with my headset on, they started hearing me snor a little bit and woke me up. 
---
You're basically asking Bethesda to make a constant cycle of griefing by only allowing new characters. You'd never get to play actual fallout for weeks. You'd be constantly hunted by players a few levels higher than you, until you could survive outside of the forest. Basically an I'm balanced arena dm. 
---
No thank you. 
---
It's really annoying. The numbers I typed didn't show up on top so I lost track of which number I was at. Next time I'll definitely stock up on a couple üëç
---
Finally a chance to use this .38 ammo
---
The only apparel available there is the enclave officer hat and uniform
---
&gt; Those players however are going to waste their time hunting down low level players for what?
---
They waste their time now hunting down low level people for absolutely no reward.  Why do you think they wouldn't do that where it's tacitly allowed?
---
Bullies are bullies.  Making bullying easier doesn't prevent bullying, it just enables the lazy bully, and gives them a more valid excuse for doing so.
---
a big ass purple felt hat, with a feather...

What i did was save my perk points for at least 5 levels, even if i knew i wanted a specific perk, until i got a card pack. Then id open the pack to see what id get, sometimes it was something i was after. It really helped keep down the amount of duplicate cards i recieved. Did that until about 78 or so, now at 115, i have about 30 points on hand at any point. Of course theres some perks im interested in investing in (other game mechanics keeping me from doing so; personal yearnings), and knowing i can do so at any given moment with my stockpile is awesome.

But just to reiterate, i played one character to level 27 before this (and before i fully understood perks) and it was really discouraging recieving cards in a pack i had literally just spent points on(especially single point/already maxed cards). Youll still get dupes, but a helllll of a lot less.
---
f#ck the level matching. If you are under leveled or under geared, go to Adventure Mode.
---
So you are a PvE player who just wants the fuckers gone off your server. I get this. I actually share the feeling.
---
But it doesn't change the fact that someone made the imbecilic decision to allow developed characters into what is meant to be a "NEW" mode.
---
If you can distance yourself then you can win a lot of the time.
---
It‚Äôs not blie and glows it‚Äôs dark and galactic 
---
Well it's not a limited time. It will be a yearly thing. Every year, for a week, there will be this festival at this time. I'm guessing they will be adding more and more events of this nature over time. 
---
So, it has a low chance, and if you don't get it, yes you have to wait a year. 
---
How as game is designed, and how a player likes to play don't always match up. Nothing I've read says that players will receive any kind of reward or acknowledgment for collecting all anything.
---
If you got a reward, even just one of those digital trophies for collecting all the Fasnacht masks, I would agree with much of what people are saying. 
---
But this event isn't designed like that. In fact, I don't think there's anything in the game designed for collecting all of. Just for collecting amounts of. Collect 76 caps today. Kill 10 cryptids today. Drink 50 alcoholic drinks today. 
---
So what's going on is players that want 100% of everything or close, are upset they can't have it now. Veruca Salt. 
---
When I was unsuspended I recorded every game session I managed to play to protect myself (1 session lol) I think we weren't meant to be unsuspended because people with permanent ban were  allowed in. Also there was no notification of unsuspend and re suspention
---
Nope. Keep the characters.... stats and perks. 
---
Make the trip a one way affair from Adventure to Survival... no returning.
---
All characters lose all legendaries, to eliminate any remnants of duped stuff. Keep your CAMP. Lose your junk, and most of your ammo.
---
Start grinding junk and  gear, but keep your levels and advancement. Seems fair to me.
---
I understand what you are saying, I'm not gonna lie the servers were really unstable but what bethesda should have done is gotten rid of all the duplicated items on someone's mule so they dont take it out on every person like the did on Tuesday. Half the people probably didn't even deserve the ban. Though there's nothing you can really do but wait until bethesda gets there shit straight.
---
I don't engage in PVP while I have junk in Inventory, that's a mistake I made early in the game when I got ganged up on by pussies that don't take chances with 1 vs 1. it's wise in this game to expect everyone trying to initiate PVP has backup hiding nearby.
---
I don't mind losing a few caps in a fair fight, but too many of the players that fancy themselves PVP experts in this game are just Cowards that travel in groups griefing lower level or Lone players.

---
I replied to my comment accidentally but like I stated I've got nuke cards and I'll buy cores as many as I can afford but won't be on till tomorrow
---
I actually learn things from you and other pvpers here. Hope you continue to post these sorts of tips. 
---
...i like the way you think, my friend
---
motorcycles.. would love to see a party of 4 headin to a queen fight on motorcycles and completely forget about ditches crash and go flying.
---
You realize a full set of assassin + sent makes someone literally invincible to all pvp damage while standing still?
---
My PF hits for 1664 and LA for 755, and a player with their eBay suit can tank either with 0 damage received.
---
No hate, it's my opinion as you have yours. Raising your character up on adventure just to reap the benefit of survival seems kinda lame to me. I'll do it either way, I'd prefer clean slate unimpacted by duping. 
---
i like that, and was thinking this myself. I've been with my hand on the screenshot button each time im awarded masks. 
---
I would like to bring up an important question in regards to survival mode: Will it have servers with a better tickrate than adventure mode? Because I swear low tickrate servers absolutely do not help in regards to projectile weapons in this game, at all. They're already very buggy currently, and I feel like a server with a better tickrate will help fix projectiles hitreg a lot more than whatever the current netcode is.
---
So while that is true it will be much harder for them to farm legendaries in this environment. Gear is really more of an issue than level
---
Might wanna check your math there... 
---
This... Just this and I'm happy
---
Why don't you upload the picture... It would save people wasting there time trying to figure out what you're on about 
---
I did this for hours before I found out about the Market
---
ah, then you can wait until right after the event ends, then everyone will be targetable again!
---
its only during the event that the no damage is in effect
---
This game mode wasn't even announced at launch and you have been grinding in a carebear pve environment, hardly the same thing as grinding in the survival environment.
---
Its raiding not griefing. Wasteland aint fair
---
Yea let me know! I'm really interested in seeing this. Sounds like a dope paint job
---
No problem, we'll just wipe everyone's progress every time a new player joins, that way it's always fair and we can all rejoice in our new communist utopia.
---
Given that you can go back and forth I highly doubt it will be split gear between modes
---
They aren't rare, I found 3 of them all in the same hour.
---
*Silo Alpha Code Piece B-0*

*Silo Bravo Code Piece C-9*

*Silo Bravo Code Piece F-0*
---
The leader boards are per server based on longest living player. There's no skill or long lasting effect of being #1. you can server hop out of that.
---
But new game mode new chars that cant be played inside adventure mode . 
---
My base takes up to 2 minutes to render when I join, it loads in a piece at a time very slowly and I have no turrets which I would guess makes it worse for some.
---
I don't know that I like this:
---
&gt;  if you have pacifist mode disabled and return fire against another player you will become hostile toward them 
---
Isn't this exactly what Pacifist Mode is supposed to stop?  So, if I'm in a nuke zone and get hit by someone accidentally (which happens often) and then I hit that same person accidentally while shooting at a ghoul or something - all of the sudden we are in PVP?  This is exactly the situation I try to avoid and why I have Pacifist mode turned on!
---
I also really wish they'd add a "forgive" option so if someone shoots me, I can forgive them and not risk PVP.   It would also be nice to have the ability to voluntarily give up a workshop.  If someone claims a workshop of mine, I'd like the option to be able to say "ok fine, take it uncontested" rather than enter PVP.
---
Lets say we do this and 3 months later comes new player and start playing in survival mode, he is now against players who are much more ahead.
---
At least with current implementation, this new player can gear up in Adventure Mode and join survival mode when he gets bored in Adventure Mode. With locked characters, this new player would be in deadend where he is getting constantly killed by players who is much better geared and he has no options to gear up.
---
Yep like a unintended ddos attack.
---
It's not you that will have a shit time a year from now. It'll be the new players. You'll be dunkin on those ppl.
---
Yep, they should make pvp enabled only within the zone itself to be honest 
---
DONT BE FOOLED by the extra exp. Its simply there to make it harder to stay as close to level 50 as possible to reduce the amount of caps you lose from dying
---
We are not welcome here. I am combative on reddit ill admit that. 
---
This sub would rather sabotage survival than let pvpers leave in peace. Yall are butt hurt weve been farming your caps n junk
---
Check my post history.. Its full of that kind of shit. 
---
This is how it should work. 
---
Here we go [cosmic? ](https://imgur.com/gallery/knkLkQq) 
---
What I'm saying is it's gonna become more of a joke if you actually drop your gears. I don't like the idea of survival mode but there's no need to make it worse
---
Civil war suit and top hat, fashionable glasses. Junkies walking cane.
---
I've never had this happen once. I've never been bullied by a high level player, nor had my camp attacked. 
---
And I generally own 2-3 workshops while playing. 
---
I feel like the number of people getting bullied by high level players is not nearly as high as people claim, the victims just are extremely vocal about it. 
---
Also, if I'm a high level PvPer, where the first shot can be ridiculously important, hunting high level players bullying low level players is a great way to get distracted easy targets for good rewards.

Give me a message tomorrow dude. Congrats on the new born üòä
---
I have a counter argument: I think it would be far more difficult to farm in a full pvp server, than in the adventure server and I don't think that people would be able to  easily get the full optimized sets they have now without taking big risks: anyone farming at whitespring, or west-tek or anywhere you're used to, would be an easy target for everyone else. Thus it wouldn't be so easy as you think to be attain their current gear if everyone was forced to a fresh start.
---
I still think it would be a better challenge for everyone, with a greater sense of accomplishment to freshly start than just hoping with a full optimized character.
---
Well, time will tell...
---
I did!
---
That is what I am saying as a level 220 toon. No way should you have any of that gear in this mode. You got it in a pve carebear environment compared to this.
---
Yup. But that will run out or become annoying. Server locking junk seems like the best solution.
---
I just want people with junk in their pockets and a reason to do something else in survival mode
---
Explosive shotgun op is üòë
---
That‚Äôs the Nuka Quantum paint. 
---
If 1% of the game could complete the collection in a week, I'd begrudgingly agree with you.  But when you have, what, .03% chance compounded by several items, it's absurd.
---
You're not wrong, and I don't disagree with what you're saying.  Coming from someone who's done game loot design in the past, I say it's just a piss poor idea (assuming it's designed that way on purpose, but I'm *actually* betting it's a mistake, nullifying any arguments either way).
---
I can get behind this. Barring there is an audience for this. Socom 4 had an issue with so many different "modes" certain ones would never  start. It was just sittin' in a queue waiting for it to start.
---
Fo76 would be just a lonely game that could be exploited if no one else joins.
---
I did a sneaky stealth shotgunner a while back. It was actually cool until you get spotted.
---
Yeah you did 4 minutes after I said that... Lol
---
That's the nuka quantum one...
---
Here is the paint, if anyone knows. [cosmic ](https://imgur.com/gallery/knkLkQq)

Did you even read the top comment? I'm talking about how all of you people act like devs that don't even deliver fabric bags because, quote: "they would've been too expensive" would spend money on good servers. Don't they literally rent them from amazon? Did you notice how people like op pop up at regular intervalls? All of this is about stingy devs who'd rather ban people then fixing theyr goddarn game, what includes laag, bug, stability and also goodies...everything we payed for.
---
Good for you if you haven't yet come into contact with everything everyone else has to deal with. Me, i'm getting thrown out of the game at the very least twice every day (in my 2-3 hours i can play at all), i have a solid 1-8 second delay on every action (try moving things in your base, it's quite obvious there)... i've stopped counting the times i've been killed by or wasted ressources on invulnerable enemies that fell over only after my death. Meanwhile people who suffer the same issues glorify banns over shit that should've been fixed a long time ago rather then adressing the devs for the lack of fixes and cheap servers. Does that make sense to you? And why are you even here if it doesn't affect you?
---
We currently have 4+ factions in game, the BoS, Enclave, Free States, and Raiders. i think this will lead to a good PvPRP community later on. (considering the best part of any fallout game is the dlc.) Military factions fighting one another, but neutral with the free states, who would ally with anyone. Raiders could attack everyone on sight.
---
 I'd like to see capitals that we can raid. Places like the citadel, or Mccarran, or Nellis AFB.
---
That would rock, but no way would they do it. Hell I want a permadeath mode
---
Exactly. So what would stop those new players demanding a reset in a year from now? Now THEY have a hard time getting into and winning Survival mode.
---
The real problem is illegitimate legendary items. The solution is to disable those account/delete those items.
---
I'm on PC, Australia/NZ region. People sell the serums that cheap?! Aren't they like 5k caps from the enclave? I'm late to the party, only got the game when wild appalachia launched, most of my info comes from google searches and most of the relevant results are 3 months old reddit threads (where I found this farming technique). I thought it'd be a bit of an rng pain in the ass but not this bad.
---
Agreed
---
Yeah the pictures people posted look nothing like my picture 
---
&gt;it‚Äôs not blue
---
But the picture you post clearly shows it mostly blue.  
---
Except have fun playing the actual game. It'll just turn into a DM arena. Especially at lower levels. 
---
Here here
---
they wont. game died a few days after release. i dont see summit1g soda or shroud who actually likes the fallout series playing this.
---
The difference is the gear. It will be far harder to grind the gear you really need to be that OP. Current server is almost no risk and you can grind all that gear, survival mode will be much harder.
---
That‚Äôs definitely the Nuka cola quantum paint with the new moon mask from the atomic store 
---
Thank y‚Äôall for the response, it looks pretty awesome.
---
Personally, I think it should be 3 teams. It'd be a nice change of pace from most game's 1 team vs 1 team.
---
My thoughts exactly!! Could have a right laugh on bikes.
---
It doesn't fix anything long term. "Once you're capable of solojng the queen there's literally nothing else"...so you're just going to do all of the same stuff over again, and end up in the same spot? That's the exact opposite of a long term fix. It's a short term bandaid. 
---
It changes a lot. You stopped playing. All that's going to happen is you'll play a few more hours and get bored again, vs the people actually playing and putting time into the game being forced to start over because some guy who's bored with the game says so. What you're wanting Bethesda to do is force everyone else to play the way you want to play. If you want a new character, make one. And if you're worried about other people farming you, then don't play survival. It's literally the point of the new servers. 
---
You could even start a new character and play on adventure until you think that character is ready to switch to survival. You can literally do whatever you want, so either play or don't, but no one cares.
---
Even that is exploitable though. People can bounce in and out of the zone and it introduces its own issues
---
Slap damage is already like 5 hp and all the people thinking they are being killed by slap are just misunderstanding what is happening (or lying).
---
I'd actually assume that's exactly why they WOULD split gear but until we have any official clarity I guess it's all just speculation and assumption.
---
I am OK with existing characters, I  just don't care for the server switching.  Too easy to restock your resources. I would love to see a true survival experience where ammo and chems are not in abundant supply.
---
I'd be good with armor and weapons damage on death too - I wish that they'd add this in. It would make dying a lot more painful if you knew your gear would break completely after a few deaths. Farming resources for repair then also become a survival necessity, and that high level scary dude in the awesome legendary gear could find themselves in a position where even a lower level is a true threat.
---
It would be nice to see incentives for both grouping up in teams or factions too. The wasteland is a lot less intimidating for new players that way, and to be honest, even raiders tend to run in gangs.  Strength in numbers and all.
---
That's a terrible business model tho
---
Then why'd you buy the skins?
---
No it isn't, you can always go back and play the other character
---
Being combative and confrontational is a different, and totally reasonable, reason to get downvoted, and to be unwelcome.  I'll defend your right to be here and state your opinions, but I'll kick you in the butt on the way out for being a jerk ;-)
---
Would that be worth loading screens and load time though? 
---
Got one of the power armor skins and then the nuka quantum paint dropped and it completely outclasses all my others in looks and I guess it still is my fault 
---
I‚Äôd be fine completely switching to pvp, it would create the survival feel like in the release trailer
---
Could I buy a few from you? I‚Äôm looking for bird bones in particular
---
Rewarding gameplay seems like a better long term strategy than rewarding dupers. 
---
I'm sure there's good people out there just like there is bad. Imo I wouldn't do that. I'm glad it works for you though 
---
ok sure you can have your opinion, but if you want it forced on the rest of us, give us some solid reasoning on why its so bad
---
PvP in of itself is not griefing. They are making many changes to adventure mode to counteract actual griefing ie: destroying a players house. If I slap you and you don't slap back it doesn't mean I'm a griefer it means I'm attempting to engage in PvP if you do not wanna fight back you dont have to PvP is a part of any multiplayer survival game, not to hurt anyones feelings but this is not a fallout game it is a survival game with a fallout paint job. (plus they seem to be removing CAMP destruction from the game unless you are hostile. Just Sayin
---
It was already said in article that PVP in adventure mode can happen only 3 ways:
---
1) Both accept the PVP
---
2) In versus zones
---
3) Fighting over workshops- this means both of you have to be in workshop area, because killing each other half a map away from workshop aint "Fighting over workshops"
---
I've noticed that a non-explosive silenced gun will alert the enemy much less than the explosive silenced.  Apparently they hear the explosions and start to look around.  With the non-explosive, if they don't see it, they don't react, so you just have to take out the one in the rear first.
---
Ok, let's pretend there's no transfers.  And you go make a new character.  And then time passes.
---
Since your character has existed for, let's say a year, you will have ground up a similar difference in gear as the people you are trying to block with "no transfers".  And you will be the one making it harder for those newer players to get their gear to compete with you.
---
Fixing that would require taking away your gear (or character) at regular intervals, so that everyone is in the same position.
---
Or we can accept that there will be "Haves" and "Have Nots" on the survival servers, independent of whatever or not Bethesda allows transfers right now.
---
Right, but this content is locked behind not using anything from the 800+ hours you have already put in which means if you are going to play the new content then you have to throw that stuff away to do so. Yes it still exists but you cant use it so what's the point. It's a bad precedent to set that we can just be told to start over because then they would do that over and over to prolong the games life. 
---
Depends on what you're doing it for I would think. 
---
Like the questing up in the mire. The 3 bunkers that are over there. 
---
Sure I could travel to the station that is kind of close, or I could switch, teleport straight to the bunker (Abby if I remember correctly) to do a quest. 
---
In that aspect it would save a lot of time and resources assuming I don't want to fight along the way.
---
You are welcome! I don't really want these plans, I've already known them. I just keep them for the vending machine (I don't even want the caps. Just for roleplaying. If a have a backyard full of junk, I have to sell that junk).
---
i just use true hiker at level 3.
---
rap sheets. I love it!
---
You should wait until the damn game mode is released before whining about features.
---
What is this?
---
[my other post is more detailed](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3sidh/bethesda_please_do_not_allow_the_transfer_of/ej2du0k/?st=jtj2d68q&amp;sh=c4a3a44f)
---
fast travel to helvetia and the mob will be lootable.
---
No heavy weapon Perks??
---
right? mother  fuckers have literally never played rust or conan
---
Two separate discussions- both important, but separate.
---
&gt;If this was a .03 on a quest you could do anytime, as much as you want and it never had an end date sure that would be entirely different.
---
I think it's truly pathetic that a one-week-only event would maintain the same crappy RNG mechanic as year-round events. 
---
That's a truly awful game design and there's no excuse for it. 
---
You can use it, in the mode you earned it in. It is nonsense to allow people to farm gear in an easier mode and then bring it to the harder mode.
---
Idk man. I feel like walking from a station would be more convenient 
---
Oooh, the one with the backpack right? Or shanks coat from Nuka world?
---
New players a year from now would understand that they will have a hard time leveling in a pvp adventure server and accept it. Starting and allowing crossover from a carebear to pvp server is just asinine. With all of the duplication from the beginning until recently, there are too many people that have gear that probably only 6% of the people should have. This is a way too unfair advantage for starting a new server type. 
---
Don't drop atom store painted PA you will lose them 
---
Yeah but for atoms anyways still good Idea.
---
i think the idea is that survival mode is supposed to be like that dark zone thingy the division had: a dedicated place to pvp, which was more difficult, but also came with rewards
---
No, they removed it because it was a bug. Just because you liked it doesn't make a difference.
---
I'm not on your platform, but am curious about your plans for them. If it is top secret, I understand.
---
Yeah I meant giant. My bad :‚ÄôL
---
Seeing the robot wandering about with the mask you're hoping to get really does feel like a kick in the teeth.
---
It'll be really simple for them to implement just a nice matte or shiny color on PA. If they make it around 200 atoms each, it'll be amazing! 
---
Both are a cost issue though.
---
Beth answers posts and comments‚Ä¶ but never on this. Fucking frustrating. People need to start at zero. 
---
Destroying something that gets you nothing, and cost significant resources to repair is not raiding, it's just being a shitty A$$hat
---
Guess we could all start slinging disease cures outside of this strip club lol
---
I found out a way to preserve their colors and have a rainbow of them
---
Huh, the idea of a strip club made me realise what I really want in this game. Interactable objects. Kinda like a table you can lean on like vendors in fallout 4. Would make my shop feel more shoppy.
---
I took a day tripper to increase my luck and it dropped for me. Give it a shot 
---
Survival isn't going to be any harder man. Only real difference that matters is the PvP is going always be on.
---
That's the quantum paint
---
A year in there will absolutely be haves and have nots, but they will still be worse off than an equivalent toon in adventure mode that had the same amount of time to grind out gear.
---
The problem isn't inequality in gear, it is difficulty in obtaining it. It also totally changes the economy in the mode of you can import gear from the other side.
---
Vs all new characters, so someone joins in say 2 months+ after it launches and gets their ass handed to them constantly?  Yeah that's really balanced there.  
---
Convenient, maybe. But it doesn't stop abuse of a mechanic that is supposed to make survival more interesting.
---
Feels like RNG in general is a bit extreme in 76. I've got no problem with running a limited time event 20-30 times if need be but if that's not going to give me a good chance at getting a rare reward then it just feels pointless. The rewards don't need to be common, they just need be realistic.
---
Aww, life must be rough for you. Scary people out there. 
---
Yeah, I couldn‚Äôt loot and someone was kind enough to smash it to pieces. 
---
Yeah exactly I don‚Äôt think you can edit pictures on Xbox lol 
---
Interesting. Thanks for your input
---
That would be fine if you just couldn't then move him back so easily.
---
The one with the backpack but without backpack. The one with backpack is called traveller's leather coat and you can obtain it the same way. 
---
Maybe I'm getting old, but in my view once you exploit something you either report bug, avoid it and get rid of anything obtained thanks to said exploit or get punished for abusing it, except for when it is likely that exploit could be triggered by accident, then you only lose what you have obtained. 
---
I honestly don't see where this is coming from that people should keep their exploited whatevers. I still remember in once of Blizzard games people 100% knowingly abusing bugs, because they were doing precisely required, very odd, specific and non normal things, ruining games for others and yet Blizzard wouldn't react, except for "hot" fix one week later. I think that people got too entitled those days.
---
I did what im saying is i dont ni the stpry even tho i neat the game 
---
I appreciate the thought, but in my experience pacifist Mode reduces my damage output on other players to near nothing. It did not prevent others from damaging me or somehow keep us separate. 
---
So for the time being, my retaliation it to quit out and find something better to do. Sometimes that just might be to pour another stiff drink, purge the last and reboot the console. So far I haven‚Äôt seen junk or caps lost. 
---
Good tip. Thank you! 4 times yesterday! Pissed me off
---
I say take it a step further.  Remove the ability to repair legendary items.  That way, you are all on an even playing field with new characters and only if someone feels the fight is worth it, do they break out the legendary stuff!
---
Yeah, that is what makes it harder.
---
Imagine a Scorchbeast Queen, or hell even a normal scorchbeast fight with full pvp on at all times. Friendly fire is going to be a thing as well.
---
Or if you have bloody mess, keep on hitting it with a melee weapon and wait till it explodes. Works 100% for me and doesn't cost caps. 
---
Yeah true and if they want extra money they can also add decals like stripes or fire variants many more options to go with this it's just they haven't worked on it.
---
That's the point?
---
Its SURVIVAL Mode, not EASY Mode.
---
Your argument makes no sense. 
---
it has no slap damage no matter what pacifist or not 
---
Buy it off other players or trade stuff you don‚Äôt want.  Ammo is constantly on sale on r/Market76.   I haven‚Äôt crafted ammo in weeks.  
---
Sure thing. I have all of them available. PSN is Josh87r 
---
I guess so
---
Glitched out? Permanently?
---
I usually just initiate the trade and look through their inventory for stuff I might want, then request those items. I usually don‚Äôt offer items from my inventory that they don‚Äôt ask for. Focus on what you want and then they will set the price. If they want your stuff, they‚Äôll request it. Once you‚Äôve looked through their wares, go to the far left inventory tab and hit R3 (on PS4) to see the request items. Set your price if they want something and wait for them to buy.
---
Given the most common use of wehrmacht, it seems unlikely.
---
Might want to add platform
---
In PVP, that's really gonna put you a head of the competition.
---
43- Xbox
---
So earning rewards is not any harder... just not getting killed by other players. 
---
Or there is a specific order for the robots to be retrieved, or even a certain mix gives certain rewards.....
---
Could be a missed opportunity...
---
I can see why they are allowing characters to move between both modes. If they only allow new characters in survival it will only be a matter of days before god tier characters show up any way, defeating the purpose of only allowing new characters. And advantage of allowing characters to play in both modes is that you don't have to abandon your character(s) if you prefer one mode over the other. With the PvP changes for the current mode, which will be called adventure mode, this appears to be a stealth method of getting PvP and PvE servers without calling them such.
---
Do you mine for materials? You can get tons of steel and lead with excavator power armor. I usually have around 10,000 bullets on my automatic weapons.
---
Right lol I forgot, I‚Äôm on PS4
---
You know there‚Äôs no difference between level 350 and 50, besides your perk cards variety, right? No real added bonus except more time playing the game to grab rare weapons. 
---
So much for sleeping tonight... Or ever again

Take a workshop and you‚Äôre mine‚Ä¶
---
Ammosmith 2 and Super Duper 3. Never craft without super duper 3!
---
Wait till you get into ultracite rounds... holy crap...
---
That is exactly what makes pve goals in a pvp situation harder to accomplish
---
I got the Old Man Winter plans
---
Speaking of someone who is currently extremely OP in adventure mode, I will not be entering survival mode unless it requires new characters. Everything everyone has already said is absolutely the case. 
---
I don't PVP in adventure mode for all of these reasons. Survival mode as a fantastic and exciting concept only if done from scratch. 
---
Yeah, the zeroing out "slap" damage thing, I can already see what's going to happen.
---
Here's an idea, place a BIG OBVIOUS FLAG on the HUD when you get PvP enabled...including when you take a workshop.
---
That way we can put paid to this "killed by slap damage" BS once and for all.
---
Bro what? It's exactly the same with a little change here and there. only 2 changes that really matter. One is PvP is always on and two is reduced fast travel.... the game is no harder. So it's still going to be just as easy overall.
---
Oh I forgot to add a 1* furious pole hook, a level 35 1 * executioners fire axe, a 1* level 45 instigating fire axe, a 3* level 35 nocturnal broadsider, a 3* suppressors flamer (vats critical shots do +50% damage, reduces enemy damage output for 3 secs and also +1 to agility and a 1* TS ultracite laser pistol.
---
Thank you Bethesda **employees!** The people that made the game and are fixing it should be thanked but the people at the top that wanted the game pushed out early (and many other bad ideas) still deserve a fuck you
---
Yeah I get that since I've experienced it. I just always assumed the loose junk was supposed to, by design, be gone or vanish in front of my eyes if I've looted it earlier in the day and have since server hopped.
---
I suppose it would be feasible that it vanishes for one player and lootable for another, although to be fair I haven't tested this. Admittedly it does break immersion when the vanishing occurs.
---
Logic in this game isn't always consistent. Like getting the "you get a free base relocation" error and still being able to place a base down in the same location on the same spot. I've made a mobile 10 rocket turret tower base for this exact reason.
---
Dunno if you'll get this but we've started a trailer for our new Raider faction! Coming soon haha! Also if you ever want to pop in our discord and read our written RP feel free! 
---
If you consider murdering everyone you see while saying racist slurs and cuss words, sure Rust is friendly.
---
No mans sky also forces you to make a separate character for survival mode, normal mode, crestive, etc. Shit just works, if it ain't broke, dont fix it. Why do we always find ourselves saying that to bethesda? Lol
---
Berry mentats allow you to see invisible people. They are cheap and plentiful and you should always have at least one on you at all times
---
So I was banned although initially wasn't sure why but then I noticed a few times I had logged in somewhere I shouldn't be which may be why. I know at one point I think one of my friends went to the dev room on my account and didn't bother telling me. Just left me in it. So that's kind of annoying. But realistically I have no way of getting to the room myself nor do I want to be there. 
---
Also, if you‚Äôre on PS4 I can throw you some 45 ammo especially if you give me a few Treasure maps.   If your on another platform don‚Äôt pay more than 1 caps per 2 rounds of those ammo types.  
---
Silly Todd, why are you on Reddit trying to manipulate this game?  You already run the studio.
---
&gt; The wanted system is also weird, you are effectively punished for being victorious in a fight. Let's say you lose, you will basically be able to donate measly caps and give them a death sentence. Bounties cannot be removed unless they are taken by another player, so killing another player will give you a giant red mark that won't go away until you are murdered. There is no way to get rid of it. To put things together, you are guaranteed to be hunted and killed, because you won a fight, which is unfun, and unfair. 
---
It makes you think, if you even want to KoS. Their vision could be that, this aint only about killing each other but playing Survival Mode just like you did before, but just with extra tension and paranoia, when you meet other players.
---
They either haven't been dropping or extremely rare for a few months now. If you are on xbone I can mod them for you. The plans for the armor themselves are sold at Watoga and Harper's ferry. 
---
I mean all they have to do is ask. I got nothing to hide. 
---
I do the same, except for the enclave. It's not my fault the BoS are racist but it's nice to know they're dead like everyone else in this state.
---
They're both essentially made up words in the English version, but what you types was close enough that I think everyone understands. I just thought it was interesting. 
---
&gt;but they will still be worse off than an equivalent toon in adventure mode that had the same amount of time to grind out gear.
---
Why?  Are you under the illusion that you'll only be doing PVP for that year?  You're going to be grinding up gear too, and a year is plenty of time to assemble a near-perfect set.
---
&gt;It also totally changes the economy in the mode of you can import gear from the other side.
---
Yep, it also makes it possible to play it "casually".  As in, hop over for one of the legendary challenges and then return to your normal adventure mode life.  Which gives you targets.  Probably most of your targets.
---
"Can be shot anywhere at anytime" is a relatively small portion of gamers, as evidenced by the concurrent player counts on PVP-anytime games/servers vs games/servers with consensual PVP.  And yes, those players are quite passionate about PVP, but there's not a lot of them.  You're going to have a player count issue if you don't make switching modes possible.
---
Generally of someone has q bounty of 5 caps, I figured they picked a lock and leave them alone.
---
Use to spawn at Grafton rail station vendor then they changed it and now I think the only way is scraping combat armor. I confirmed today I got the bos helmet mod from scraping a random chest piece.
---
Its not a penalty, you bought the product with no promise of a suevival mode even existing. Theres 0 obligation to cater to you especially since if they change it all the people complaining will still keep playing anyways. 
---
You sound like a funny person. Wow.
---
Star wars reference. c:
---
But it is disturbing when Jagex has a higher response rate than Bethesda.
---
He's saying he UNDERSTANDS why they did it... 
---
You're thinking way too short term. If they only allow new players that only puts a 48 hour (at most) timer on when the gaming gods show up.
---
I for one am happy about the transfer, I've been working on a Charisma/Team Strength character and I'm glad I'll be able to use it :)
---
Also being sold on the FO76 market right now (not by me)
---
Scrapper perk while breaking all the junk weapons you grab is amazing for steel.
---
I love the idea of starting from scratch because it gives a leveled playing field for everyone.
---
Just while I was wearing the beret lol
---
There's a new mode called survival that you can always do full damage to other players, go play it.
---
this game is already 99% server hop'ing. i would prefer to reduce the reasons instead of adding more.
---
My two heavy weapons are TSE and the increase to damage is on non-explosive on those perks
---
I get pvp... and caps and junk when i win.. When i kill you defending your camp or bounty hunters coming after me. 
---
I profit from it. You are absolutely wrong.
---
Wow.  I'm quite embarrassed.  I didn't mean Wehrmacht, I meant Kaiser.  I got my era mixed up.
---
So, to clarify, I was talking about the PRE-World War One German officer uniforms and the big spiked helmets.
---
My apologies if anyone was offended by my faux-pas.
---
Haha take grahm over Fasnacht. Fasnacht is easy to find lol
---
Why can't there be a leveling system?  Like being within 15 levels higher or lower?  But I guess a level 50 could walk around with little fear having God rolls in armor and weapons.  One shotting a level 200 because that guy didn't spend 100k on armor lol. I love this game but, it's got major issues. 
---
I've seen it. A lot actually. It always cracks me up because they will be right next to you jumping up and down like a kangaroo. Where did they even learn that? Is it the meta for a different game?
---
Without exception every one of these people were brought down by a casual vats one handed crit strike. 
---
Its low tier strategy for sure. 
---
No, he's saying they did it because of survival mode. That's false.
---
Haha :)
---
None of the whiners in this thread have ever played the original everquest. when you died in that game you lost xp and moved back levels. You die in this game and all you lose is junk, junk can be replaced. Grow a set and get em' wet people.
---
Definitely not by design. If someone loots a room prior you exploring there everything should be gone. It always has been that way up until Fasnacht.
---
How does it add server hopping?
---
I said server locking. As in you cant take junk from adventure into survival and vice versa
---
&gt;Why would anybody WILLINGLY be on the leaderboard? It has no reward and all the consequence? If I need to kill myself to avoid being on a leaderboard, that should say something. Fix? Either don't highlight players, or give rewards for being on it. 
---
I would do that just from fun perspective + also from competitive perspective. CS:GO doesn't give you anything for being "Master Guardian" or lower or higher, but you still do it. Exactly same reason I climb ladders in CS:GO, I'd do same in here. 
---
Two reasons:
---
1) Layered armor, making it extremely difficult to avoid clipping
---
2) Weapon mods, making it extremely difficult to avoid clipping
---
Todd has a mule with every lost item and infinite carry weight.  He's only level 2 but can one shot the server with a rolling pin.
---
its been that way for me since launch, its habit now that i know the first 30 seconds i cannot do ANYTHING or shouldnt even move to keep it from freezing or discon while loading.  Does PC have the same issue?  Was thinking about playing on my PC so i can get the full graphics effects etc.
---
My YouTube channel is full of me engaging in PvP. It's all I do. Try me. You couldn't kill me if you tried for a thousand years. Not to mention, remember when the rumors on this game were a battle royal game? That's because it basically was intended to be survival mode from the beginning. My cousin works as a game tester at Bethesda Maryland. 
---
To me its the only logical solution on peoples concern about people jumping in fully geared in the top end massively duped pvp gear and tse/aae/ie/assassins stuff.
---
Think diablo reset the server/wiped it every 3months or so never really heard anyone complain on having to roll new characters.
---
I have this exact issue, I buy the game and now can't even play... wow just wow
---
I got that one and it's been about 3 weeks since.
---
If they don't let us use existing characters then they need to let us buy new character slots to avoid deleting old ones to start new survivor
---
Yeah, there is always more balance to be done.  I feel like balance is easier without the myriad of legendary mods though.  Its kind of like how WoW  had to balance between PVE and PVP, especially Arena.  You could have separate stats for each server type.
---
maybe he wanted to try the new meat
---
So? You want a cookie or something?
---
I mainly use Lever Action Rifles, so I'd suggest Ammosmith and Super Dupers.
---
Actually it fixes quite alot long term, by removal of all the duped gear via forced new character you'll find PvP a wildly different experience, and yes it will be the same thing again but there is a reason I put400 hours in before I quit, I loved finding new useful gear it's a critical part of looter games it's also why diablo regularly wipes it's charecters on the most popular servers.
---
Yes I quit, but to assume that means it will never be my main game again is moronic, I quit because of lack of what I could do and not feel "behind" by making it force new characters I wouldn't be behind. 
---
Clearly your missing the point the point of survival but as you can freely switch it misses any point of being a hard mode as you can freely switch to easy mode.
---
Also clearly you care what I think as your getting very up in arms.
---
Watch it dude's the OG......... hide your name 
---
I feel like disabling legendaries for that mode would also be an equalizer.
---
Seems to be caused by the fasnacht music. I noticed after the event no ingame music was playing other than radio.
---
Are we really pretending that 9k is a good sample size for anything?
---
Then a month in you create a god tier of players that no newbie would ever be able to touch.  At least jumping in an existing toon gives you some fighting chance.
---
Be careful, as a fully tricked-out Gauss Rifle will weigh in at about 24 pounds.  Whereas a The Dragon will weigh in at less than half that.
---
Gauss Rifles are HEAVY.
---
But it does make a good choice for replacing The Dragon, as it has a scope and with a full charging time shot, does similar (if not superior) damage.
---
new toon or not, still nothing to do but grind. just be glad it's not RDO.
---
Ok I‚Äôll add you tonight. Thanks! I sell plans and have about 100+ duplicate plans. If you want any plans just let me know.
---
What's the secret? I keep trying to help random and we always lose. 
---
Maxed shotgun with enforcer and I can get her to sit down no problem but even after 1000 shells she was only halfway both times.  
---
what that perk is saying is that it doesn't affect explosive weapons like fat man, missile launcher, grenade launcher etc. tse 50cal will get full benefit out of that perk. you need those
---
When it first came out it was nice
---
&gt; Survival should 100000% start out with everyone on an equal playing field, since the duping has been pretty much been squashed, and combat would be much more balanced. I am NOT looking forward to being 1-shotted over and over again, which beside your best efforts WILL happen if you let characters transfer over.
---
What about those who are going to start playing this game in this summer? Where is going to their "equal playing field". It's a actually very simple- you don't play Survival Mode until you are geared up. Up until then, stick to Adventure Mode and gear up.
---
?????
---
Ad Victoriam
---
Aw man just joined your world lol, got one more in ya?
---
I had a bunch on Xbox, even found a pink one, but when I collected more they all turned to standard blue :(
---
I‚Äôll check how many I have when I log on in a sec.
---
1000 caps!
---
Learn something new every day. That‚Äôs awesome! Thank you. What would you suggest replacing? 
---
Tl;dr "I need a safe space"
---
you hop to non-PvP, repair, build, etc. then you hop back to PvP. all you have achieved with junk locking is 2 server hop's.
---
Hard to imagine LOL.  But I played around a year after release.
---
People will absolutely be doing PVE to get gear, but they will hardle ever be able to do the large scale co-op grind events like you can in adventure mode because they will end up in pvp.
---
A typical classic whitesprings grind would be nearly impossible. I can't even imagine. A Scorchbeast Queen fight in this mode. Nuke zones are going to be alerts to people looking for targets that pve is about to happen.
---
People with best in slot gear are going to happen, but nowhere on the scale we see now. 
---
As far as playing it casually goes, that is what adventure mode is for.
---
Ok I like collecting plans, even the ones I‚Äôll likely never use. Most people don‚Äôt have any that I don‚Äôt already know anymore though but I‚Äôll definitely look through them. What‚Äôs your psn so I know who to look for?
---
I'd love to have both options. Sometimes I feel like just exploring,  other times I am into the survival experience. 
---
Nahhhh
---
Impressed =/= approved.
---
But your point about PvP is good insight.  I'm not sure that had anything to do with the removal of the exploit/bug, but it certainly makes the change more important.
---
The old man winter effigy plans are something different. It's the bonfire thing. Far as we know there are not plans for any of the masks.
---
It's coming out in less than a week, why would they reverse course?
---
I wanna love survival mode, but 1 shot broken builds will ruin it.
---
"So it can be balanced and fair for everyone who plays in survival mode"
---
boom there you go

I see. Thanks for the clarification. I noticed that after the event started, radios don't seem to work for a while as well. I hope the devs notice it. I rather liked the sound.
---
u/LadyDevann u/Valseek
---
Sorry for attracting attention over such a minor issue but kindly pass on the message, if possible.
---
Again, I disagree with this, if you can't transfer the characters between the two the vast majority of people won't be playing the mode, which means making this gamemode would be pretty much just be a waste of time for them.
---
Very true. It was a bug that skirted intended game mechanics. Even without survival mode it may have been fixed eventually. After the last patch though I saw many comments of why did they fix x when y is still not working? Now I see why. With the new survival mode coming, it at the very least gave them a reason to bump it to the top of the list. 
---
Is there a way onto the church without marsupial? Afk camping while eating dinner or what not seems like a good idea. I don't much care about the masks, but I want ALL of the camp decorations.
---
depending on the new xp gains i might just powerlevel my new char there, was considering a new char but didnt wnna grind my whole way up there and also lose all my plans and stuff, but just maybe?
---
What's the point of adding content no one gets to experience? seems like a giant waste of time and effort. 
---
Would you pm me the method as well?
---
And pls consider of not making a post about it. If it's like white Springs, it will get nerfed too 
---
Same as my username on here. Yeah come to my shop and take a look at my wares, Helvetia Market is open for business! 
---
I have a lvl. 40 executioners plasma Gatling, +50% damage when Target is below 40% health, 25% faster fire rate
---
That will end once your stash depletes in a month. 
---
Recent patches have somewhat changed them a bit, if you change the light color you can preserve their original color. So I‚Äôm trying to get every color right now
---
Neither was I promised a "0 damage to players in adventure mode", so I'll stay in adventure mode, but then I also expect of getting what was promised to me, what was:"You are going to do reduced damage to player, and if they ignore it, it will kill them".

I use a hunting sniper rifle as my main gun and am usually blowing through .308 rounds, so I totally understand your issue. Usually what i do if I start running low is go to my camp, unload just about everything I have to free up carry weight, grab a weapon and the bajillion rounds I never use from my stash (usually a laser rifle or something) and a melee weapon, then just make a giant loop through the forest and farm L3 scorched and grab everything that isn't nailed down. That usually nets me quite a bit of ammo, a ton of junk to make more ammo, and a bunch of random junk I can bulk and sell to buy more ammo. It's a nice little change of pace every once in a while and more fun than just fast traveling to iron deposits.
---
I think the way they're doing it currently is for people with characters built for PVP, to have a sandbox to test their abilities against like minded players. Segregating pvp servers into level ranges would be one solution, even if that doesn't prevent a character from getting twink level appropriate gear. I mean the alternative would be like rust and have survival designated character wipe at the end of every month. that way new players can come in at a later date on equal footing.
---
Only if the person hardcore grinds for that god Tier loot. Stuff that should have been near impossible that was duped should not be allowed. I don‚Äôt understand how people even remotely think that is fair. The only ones that seem to think god tier weapons should be able to be transferred are the ones that bought the duped shit to take the easy way out. 
---
lol quantum
---
Same, I'm considering running it here and there with my existing toon.  If it was new only I wouldn't bother.
---
The hunter pet example was good because its just a human cosmetic for a wolf. I think the line is how much of a benefit do people get from these. 99.99% of helmets in this game are effectively cosmetic. In wow we had character bound and account bound things. We can take a cosmetic and sell it for the big caps here and this is where the lines get blurred a little.
---
I don‚Äôt know man at least 40% of people think this is funny as hell.
---
Heavy guns are the way forward dude. You have to stack perks and drugs to max your damage out as well! Like I use a bloodied explosive prime .50cal.. the buffs I got are
---
Adrenal reaction mutation
---
3* nerd rage
---
All the heavy gunner perks 3*
---
3* stabilised
---
3* bloody mess
---
3* one gun army 
---
5* demolition expert 
---
2* grenadier 
---
Plus a few other bits 
---
I‚Äôm always below 20 health and my gun does 600+ damage per bullet 
---
The event is the content. Not digital items. Plus the event isn‚Äôt over. 
---
lmao so basicly gta online after finishing a heist with your group
---
Okay, so you have played pvp in a carebear mode. Totally different.
---
And no, survival mode as we are getting it was absolutely not announced, and your cousin doesn't count as a source, sorry.
---
I have been on the hype train for this game from day one, it was never brought up.
---
This 
---
You can shoot anything in a public workshop to accomplish the same thing, there is simply no justification for destroying some random players CAMP to initiate PVP, there are many other way to accomplish that.
---
Most players taking a public workshops these days are doing it specifically for the PVP, I see them on virtually every server, and partake of the exercise myself, so don't tell me you can't find any, you are just trying to justify your shitty behavior.
---
44 &amp; lvl 230, been playing since beta
---
My YouTube channel is full of me engaging in PvP. It's all I do. You couldn't kill me if you tried for a thousand years. Not to mention, remember when the rumors on this game were a battle royal game? That's because it basically was intended to be survival mode from the beginning. My cousin works as a game tester at Bethesda Maryland. They wanted no restrictions since launch. I've been getting ready since then
---
alternatively...
---
1) Be Preston Garvey
---
Ok thanks will do
---
Considering a group killed SBQ within days after launch, this will happen guaranteed.
---
I know players had issues with this when it was rumored to be possible, and I‚Äôm sure that we were at least heard because when they announced that survival was a thing and you can transfer characters they also put in the fine print that all decisions are not finally and things are likely change. They wrote that in what I‚Äôd like to think was the sentence after the character transfer thing. Take this with a grain of salt.
---
I love the idea but many will hate it. As long as it's an optional mode though, it'd be great.
---
That‚Äôs soooooo cool üòéHopefully I‚Äôll come across your CAMP someday &amp; we can have a drink of Old Possum together üëçüòä
---
I‚Äôm gonna check him out when I‚Äôm off work! Thanks!
---
Wish I could bro but we can‚Äôt do anymore as we all have cooldown times lol 
---
im using the "???" emote right now
---
You don't have to participate in the seasonal modes - just keep playing regular pvp mode. 
---
I'd only agree to that is all my learned plans/recipes transfer. I am not regrinding out all of my plans and recipes. No fucking way. 
---
No that that level 900+ dude
---
"Get up without my permission, I'll blast your ass so far through your head, it'll turn the moon cherry pie red."
---
Me and Biv were jush talkin. \*hic\* It might be funny. I'll ashk.....
---
I have a Tunnel Snakes server if you are interested 
---
I saw him last night at the event too.... BUT NO MOO-MOO!!!!!!!
---
where for art thou, moo-moo?
---
Also having a good team with similar builds help. More lower level there is the harder it is to kill as well.
---
Those guys that killed the SBQ days after launch also played during the beta. So they had a head start. 
---
Someone made a great point in this thread. Has anyone done multiple events on the same server? I'm wondering if server hoping has something to do with it?
---
That .03% is based on bad data from someone‚Äôs faulty poll. None of us know what the chances are. 
---
There should be some stairs leading up in the back of the church (inside) to take you to the upper floor. Then head back towards the front of the church and there should be more stairs going to the rooftop. 
---
(Disclaimer, I‚Äôve not seen the inside of this church, but that‚Äôs how similar ones are laid out. But on the roof you see stairs going down so there has to be a way up from inside)
---
:( I hate running bloodied. It's always me and like two lvl 50s just doing the quest line. 
---
I really appreciate the perk break down though. Doing God's work!
---
Except here, we're rewarding those who put the most RL money into a dupers pockets. Some people traded for their stuff (which is still mostly duped gear by the way), but most bought it.
---
nice, and i want the gold with silver handmade :D
---
I dunno man. I have no idea what's best for me and end up switching my build constantly. 
---
it makes no difference where the stuff is locked. if you have gathered everything in PvP and you end up to have something to repair while you are just playing some fun PvE with friends then you have to server hop again twice.
---
if you always stay in PvE or PvP then you are right, then you don't need to server hop. but you also don't need to lock the junk. because we are talking now about a player that stays in one mode anyway. no reason to lock the junk.
---
36. Blizzofile3383
---
It's still crazy either one. Let's shoot a bell and go up 300 levels 
---
What you suggest *could* happen, but it would be a much smaller chunk of the population 
---
This. I see people walking around with full sets of unyielding / sent, assn / sent, a TSE / AAE / BE of every weapon type... and they ahve no idea how to farm legendaries, and are half my level with only 1 toon. 
---
I have no interest in workshops.
---
I played just about every hour the beta was up and hit level 12.  They were in the 70s with full power armor.  People grind for end game commonly, just see every MMO ever released for reference.
---
Either remove shotgun  when not using or blocking. 
---
Patterns are everywhere, this is already happening sometimes, it will be happening to a greater extent on survival servers
---
i found a pic of someone on reddit with it it was not from the trailer
---
I'd agree only if you take your learned plans and recipes with you. I am not regrinding those. 
---
I fully agree that only new characters should be available in survival, although I do have some concerns about the mode, like what happens when we first exit the vault, will it be a free for all?  What will happen to pvp events to enforce participation rather than direct conflict, or any event for that matter? Will camps be granted anymore health to promote better tactics or trade once the machines are added in, kind of like rust?  I wish we could get more info on details like these from BGS, although I may have missed some stuff.
---
This problem statement is "There are illegitimate legendary items". The fix isn't to reset *one specific game mode*. The fix is ban or deleting items. Otherwise the problem persists.
---
They couldn't work on that? 
---
New characters or I'm not playing survival. And I had such high hopes for the new game mode. 
---
I read it twice and all I got out of it was a headache. 
---
Wut?
---
Do we know if that's legit or a dev room grab?  Because even someone supposedly saw the backpacks already on one character.
---
Someone has been hanging out with Biv a bit too much.
---
As good as an idea this is the pvp is still really broken for this to be honestly enjoyable. If they were to fix most of it and balance it then I‚Äôd be all aboard but I‚Äôm a lvl 112 and I was in the middle of swapping my build so I wasn‚Äôt at my full potential and I got killed in one hit in X-01 by a lvl 64 and honestly that shouldn‚Äôt happen unless it‚Äôs a fatman. He was using a meat hook btw... ‚òπÔ∏è
---
Theoretically. It'd take a fucking long time to do though, and cause conflicts any time they introduced new armor/weapons. That's more of a headache than it's worth.
---
I want more long hair options for men as well.
---
The size of the map and low player count does not play well with structured PvP in this manner. I'm thinking of Planetside where even with a thousand people on a map it's still very easy to see nobody but friendly players. The only way to ensure you actually see somebody is see where a battle is taking place, or bring along a few dozen friends to get a battle going.
---
The "level playing field" is only realistic for the first week of the introduction of the gamemode, really.
---
What sucks is he only drops level 35 gear. 
---
Bringing additional key cards is a big help, but that said, I'd really like the keypad to have an actual Enter key, rather than having the last number double as confirmation.
---
Thinking pretty highly of your self aye 
---
Will it actually work though....
---
I converted my sniper to 50 cal rounds. Ammosmith 80%. Make 1000 50 cal easily.
---
I can see the issues with this for players straight out of the vault, but the fact that you can transfer characters from adventure mode sort of makes the power gap a hard mode of sorts, if you can‚Äôt manage in survival, play in adventure mode until you‚Äôre beefy enough to get by.
---
I mean I‚Äôm okay with some things being super rare and unique 
---
Haha, you have a really lovely home (my apologies for that "misunderstanding" *\*cof \*cof\**).
---
He‚Äôs just drunk it‚Äôll be fine 
---
I did 50 maps one weekend and didn't get any. 
---
Sounds like a cool event for Survival mode. 
---
I was deeply saddened this was removed, especially as we have some camp items that simply doesnt work (power counter is an example), but I think the OP is right and it had to be done to prevent AFK leaderboard exploiting. I despised that change. Now I support it.
---
25 years of not being used. Something is going to break 
---
Sorry I don't have any proof but my friend got a zombie looking mask by just doing the event
---
People have been begging for PvE and PvP servers, now we have them!
---
I don't like the brotherhood, but that's pretty good man.
---
Put a scope on that gun
---
It's still stupid, you have to look at the longevity of a gamemode from months, years for now.
---
Within a month of this gamemode coming out, people farming all day would still have OP gear (Even with taking for granted that new duping methods won't eventually come out) while the people that didn't really care about the new mode will still have nothing against them.
---
Get a furious or anti Armor heavy explosive gun! You will see the difference dude. Thanks man
---
Thank you so much!! (Also, no worries, I got a good laugh out of it!) :D
---
How will destroying other people‚Äôs camps work?
---
Raid in survival mode.
---
Oh yeah. You can also "execute" other players by using the Cannibal perk as well.
---
wat
---
Thank you for your reply. I have more than 1000 maps to use so I want to be sure to have the possibility to get them
---
Nothing a screw driver wouldn't fix.  If only I could reach into the screen...
---
Yes. And I always tell people how gross it is. Role-playing of course but yeah it grosses me out
---
Good luck out there. May you find what you're looking for. 
---
So too is the topic of Atom points‚Ä¶ But unrelated to this discussion.

Twice I havnt even had the sloth spwn and another 4 times it‚Äôs glitched for everyone so no one could loot it.

Better look

I agree, Survival is for hardercore players, but hardcore =/= high level or geared. Your "suggestion" to play Survival mode is to play Adventure mode. What? If Survival mode were Adventure+ mode with always active-pvp then I'd be inclined to agree with you. Survival should be harder-hitting mobs, lower health dwellers, less carry weight, no fast travel, more rad damage, and less effective aid items if the New Vegas and 4 iterations are any kind of indicator.
---
I have no problem if someone who is level 100 in X-01 power armor armed with a 3\* legendary weapon can wreck me when I'm level 5 in light leather armor with a 10mm. But if said player got all that gear by prancing around in adventure mode, buying potentially duped items, and running no risk while gearing and leveling then that's not Survival. That is closer to pay to win. It makes more sense if you want to be great in Survival then you need to have been only in Survival.
---
Yes it's funny lol
---
Surival mode
---
Legendary rewards in survival mode should be actual legendaries, not a 1* scorched wood armor. Rewards from challenges should have more than  3* on them, we get those on adventure mode. In my 600+ hours of gameplay i have never seen the neverending legendary affix on anything, maybe add that to that assassins lever action along AA affix now that is something worth taking on the challenge for. 
---
Rewards in survival, doubling the caps for PK's and thats it? I get that in adventure using a lvl 55 toon picking a fight with a lvl 250+ dude in power armor. How about double everything, amount of caps in cap stashes, amount of resources collected in workshops and aside from doubling the cap rewards for PK's treat every PK kill like it was a legendary enemy kill where the player killed would generate legendary item drops. There needs to be more incentive to the rewards other than just caps.
---
Bragging rights, other than the score board. For any player that has earned a medal let them have the ability to glow like the legendary glow effects legendary enemies have whenever the player gets below 30% health. Let them have something tangible to show for other than the score board, similar to having rank stripes. 
---
Yeah, but you shouldn't have to, and Endurance needs more cool perks anyways. Professional Drinker needs some love.
---
Make it into a competition? No thanks. People trying to have the most camps destroyed.
---
They should just make it a bundle deal like they did in F4 but sell it for 350 atoms cause it‚Äôs literally just one solid color for your power armor probably the easiest thing to do.
---
Yeah, yeah, I know... everyone was innocent. But really, the one time I earned a WANTED status was for shooting a Scorched attacking someones camp and I must have hit the house. Then two guys in Power Armor show up at my CAMP and wasted me. No I just ignore all crime at other peoples CAMPS. 
---
This is of interest to me as well -- any one with more info, I'd really like to be in the know. I was tentatively making a deal to trade my maps for ammo and if the plans are possible, I may opt to pass on my deal.
---
Workshops are of such limited use I really don't see the point of this. You can get the same stuff from workshops anywhere else in the game, and probably have more fun doing it. Workshops will now be a way to consensually enter into PvP, which is how it should have worked in the first place.
---
be me haven't played f76 in months but have a lvl 50 character in normal mode
---
the new survival mode has been running for said months but can't cross play with my lvl 50 character so make a new one for survival
---
start out as a lvl 1 boy straight out the vault
---
\&gt;gets one shot and spawn killed by lvl 50s
---
\&gt;balanced
---
But thats not what raiders do though they go after the weak and take what they want when they want it. Even in adventure mode there should still be some damage for the rp aspect of the raider trying to take some loot off you
---
Getting my ass kicked lol.
---
Survival is survival it's supposed to be hard.if I dropped you in the jungle I couldn't ask the tigers to level down.if people don't want an uphill battle play pve.if some dude is playing ten hours a day seven days a week he will be op in a month compared to the casual gamer,that's life.my advice is get your character ready for the jump.
---
That's what they are doing. Adventure is PvE, survival is PvP. If you want to be a raider head into Survival mode.
---
What do you mean with "execute"? 
---
I find if he doesn‚Äôt give it to me and 20+ hours have passed since the last quest, I have to server hop until he does.  He won‚Äôt give it to me on that server no matter how much I zone in/ out and spam X.  
---
I got it after 10 or so times. My alt is at 5 times and still didnt get it.
---
Yeah, I just use the little red martini glass to let me know when it's time to take another drink. 3 points to prevent alcohol addiction? Maybe if it was 1 point. Or 2 points to prevent any addiction.
---
I didn't even know this was a thing!
---
I got some right before the DLC. Don't know if they changed anything with it. 
---
It'll decrease the fairness because the nolifes (like me, no offence intended here) will be armed to teeth in three days while the casuals will have to struggle. You failed to provide any reason for which fresh start would increase the fairness, besides that you are fanatically sure it would.
---
I will say this, it was waaaay easier to get xp earlier on than it is now. 
---
thank you, don't know why they never link to it...  also why is it not the top article on [http://bethesda.net/news](http://bethesda.net/news)
---
It would be nice if benches and other things would break down from wear and tear. But that would require more item models. 
---
*lol* thanks 
---
Yeah, I'm almost 140 and from time to time I see a lower level person from my vantage point setting up a CAMP.  I run down there to welcome the new neighbor, weapons sheathed, and almost always they log out as soon as I show up at their CAMP.  I've never damaged anyone's CAMP, but the fear of griefing is keeping people from interacting, which is a shame.  I'm looking forward to this long overdue change.
---
But that is the thing, a new mode should start with new characters. If a person gets the game a year from now, they will know what they are getting into. That argument is so flawed. Look at CoD, if you get the game late do you expect to have an even playing field? No you don‚Äôt. But the odds should not be insanely stacked against them because bethesda let god tier loot get duped and sold. The odds of a character getting the god tier loot that was duped is low, even with heavy grinding. I have played over 200 hours and have yet to see a tse or sentinel armor drop. I only recently saw my first vanguard armpit piece drop, and it was one star. So in fact the rng aspect of the game would keep the game fair for a decent amount of time. And being able to freely go between modes is a whole different issue that is stupid also. 
---
When a player is downed, but not dead, you have the option to eat them.
---
Yeah, my theory is that it‚Äôs 0 due I a programming bug, but no real evidence to go on. 
---
Be better and more people will be weaker than you.
---
That was kinda my thought.  Are we really saying that something that doesn't exist yet is already broken?  Maybe there are more details available about it than I have seen, but I feel like this is a wait and see what happens situation.  I do think it would be great if there was more to it than PVP.  I'm not super excited to get into PVP, but if I can level faster, or get better gear or something for taking on the risk I'd try it.  But if it just ends up Fortnite with a fallout theme I'll probably just stay in adventure land anyway.  Which I guess begs the question, if you are this worried about it already, why are you even thinking of going to survival?
---
That would be.  I'd also be excited for some themed ones.  I know they have the one vault tec weapon bench.  But a whole set would rock.  Or a raider, responder, bos or other faction themes.
---
Just turn it outside in and call it a racing stripe.
---
The rare Fasnacht masks are attainable, they are just very rare. Thanks to your feedback, we‚Äôre looking into improvements we can make to the drop rates in the future for rare item rewards associated with time limited events.
---
No, I need more diseases to complete the challenge
---
If youre wanted the other player can attack your camp freely
---
The odds of the god tier weapons dropping or god tier armor dropping is so low it would take months to get a good set. The reason there are so many sets out their is because of duping.
---
Ahh got my Hope's up
---
Is that a thing? never seen a nuked parade. It'll die down eventually. Firing a nuke is a pain in the arse nowadays and people can just server hop. Not worth the effort
---
Well just like real life, the propaganda is so thick it can be heard to tell.
---
I got mine from treasure maps. 
---
It just slows the problem down, it doesn't fix it at all
---
Its not about being better its about looting and killing people against their wills. With the removal of slap damage raiders basically don't exist.
---
I am not an expert but I do know if you shoot back or have a workshop you are fair game. And the new patch requires much more base damage to become wanted. Not sure how much. Picking the lock won't do it. Replace the door with a solid wall if you want to keep people out. I just use the open door policy. And just a guess but if your turrents fired on him it may have caused you to be in PVP.
---
How much do you want for it 
---
Thank you for the reply I hope they haven't changed the loot table 
---
There's no game that restarts a new character for a new game mode. There's no argument for it other than from an incorrect problem statement.
---
As a preemptive statement on FO4 have a new character, this mode includes permadeath. 
---
If Fo76 is going to require new characters, it would have to be per session for "fairness". 
---
Sure, but neither he nor I ever had a bounty. 
---
They stole my caps! Those raiders PKd me and stole my wood for the bonfire!
---
I know I didn't start playing until mid December my friend said I missed all the free leveling 
---
That and I can't imagine BoS giving away technology. They would more likely put someone at gunpoint if they saw them walking around with recon scope.
---
No it wont. You can still pvp on all the same ways except those that involve slap damage.
---
oops...looks like I'd clicked the wrong "reply".  Sorry about that
---
i'm doing it for the daily challenge, have to sell an item to a player
---
Future dlc could add that. 
---
Request a trade. I intend to do so as well.
---
What platform are you on? You may be able to find someone willing to sell you some flux, especially since selling something to another player is one of today's challenges.
---
I run an unarmed bloodied build and the only time Ive ran into trouble is when she wouldn't land. Ive only killed her maybe 15 times and failed 2 times. One time she bugged and wouldnt land. The other time there were \~10 people and only 2 consistently shooting and I was the only melee(2h) build at the time. Unarmed is fantastic for the SBQ as long as she lands. All of the nukes I drop allow her to be fought outside of the rad zone, so no PA or hazmat suit needed. The few times I do have to go in the rad zone I just put on my hazmat suit and really dont have much more trouble, just a couple more psychobuffs and stims. If we had deck presets im positive I could solo the queen. Just quick swap to HG/stagger deck to get her to land then quick swap back to unarmed. The moment she lands for the first time I pop a vintage nukashine/psycho/whiskey and can kill her before I blackout. Or If the ranged peoples damage is terrible I can teleport back and finish the job. When you can see the queens health bar turning transparent grey for each of your swings, you're doing great [damage](https://imgur.com/a/DlNqqzO).  
---
But farming adventure to use in survival defeats the purpose and intensity of survival. Survival should be a stand alone mode that people should not be able to switch between. 
---
Then go into survival mode and do it. Maybe they'll make it even more hardcore in the future so you can take armor and guns off players when you kill them.
---
I had a workshop earlier in the play session, but it was taken without contest. Does taking a workshop flag you for pvp indefinitely? I thought you had to be in the area.
---
Haven‚Äôt been able to get a new one it‚Äôs been over 20 hours 
---
Where I agree wholeheartedly, I've even expressed the same sentiments on another forum, it's too late. Its coming out next week, hell, the code has been in the game going on three weeks already. 
---
May be a dumb question but I haven‚Äôt gotten any daily quests from Biv at all, I‚Äôve already finished the nukashine quest. How‚Äôd you activate your quest lines for him?? 
---
No, it was all stuff I made myself 
---
I'm hoping to see the MC's top hat ... but thanks for the list i was looking for that ... 
---
That's really hard to balance though (from a long time Planetside 2 player) It is usually 2 vs 1 faction
---
Keep the characters nerf some perks for this mode and maybe have new items for characters, like they don‚Äôt keep what they have in the base game coming into Survival 
---
You have to visit him daily to trigger them. 
---
Not to mention, I just want to do the challenges for the legendary survival weapons, and gain the 20% XP boost from doing events I usually do anyway. Having only the top three people in the server marked means I'll know where the more griefer types are, and they won't know where I am.
---
I'm worried about certain OP builds, however the patch notes say they are rebalancing, so I'd guess bloodied melee builds will cease to be.
---
First, griefers don't care about reprisal, you may be misunderstanding what griefers are after.  
---
Second, as you already know, the griefer can still be blocked and servers can still be changed, which means players lives will not be made anymore difficult. no difference there.  Third, what you're describing is a change, not an increase.   If somehow you're able to quantify this as a increase it would be like saying and infinity+one is more than infinity.   There is no shortage of creativity and imagination when it comes to trolling/griefing. 
---
Biv sometimes completely ignores you till you server hop. Happened to me the first time I went to do his quest. I kept pressing A and he wouldn't talk to me. Server hopping fixed it.
---
zoot suit plz, with a a walking cane skin that's one of those disco canes
---
I see. Ill just pay him a visit more often and see if I can trigger it. 
---
Absolutely agree with this. New game mode should require a new game.
---
crossing paths with folks to pvp with could be pretty rare considering NO ONE is listed on the map. you don't have to crouch to hide from the map anymore. but of course everyone is complaining about it before it even comes out and not a single person even knows how it really is. just the anticipation anxiety lashing out on reddit per usual. 
---
i can't wait for survival mode. it'll re-trigger the scares and tension we all had when we first started playing fo76 until we realized nobody could hurt you unless you fought back. 
---
If you go into camp mode you are able to see them, they are listed in floor/wall/and mis. Decor 
---
When your definition of pvp is exploiting mechanics and harassing low level players it might unpopular.  Shocking!  I know!!
---
It was crazy, you would walk away from whitesprings 20 levels higher than you walked in 
---
Thanks for letting me know!
---
the beret seems to just share loot pool with the plans. at least thats my experience. got 3 so far instead of a plan along with the mask
---
If you have a workshop you open yourself up to PVP. Says that right on the screen when you pay the caps to take it. 
---
Thanks. I think my rifles usually weigh in at 17 or 18 but I've heard the gauss was heavy.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen with a Yao guai, snallygasters and the sloth 
---
&gt; Duping has wrecked the weapon pool in Adventure, and it will ruin Survival. There is currently plenty of OP builds that have been fully fleshed out in the months of time spent in Adventure mode, and them making their way over to Survival would be awful.
---
I think they have ro balance op things instead of not allowing us to play old chars
---
Happens to me like 90% of the time. Gotta try it the next time it happens.
---
What platform are you on? I'm sitting on a bit of crimson flux I'd be willing to part with. 
---
is the player base really large enough to split the community to different modes like this? I guess I'm the only one that enjoyed pvp in adventure mode, sure it needed some adjusting but this seems a bit excessive. Guess we'll see how it goes. 
---
One of my favorite moments of base game is when a gang of level low 20s- to 30 and myself got into a disagreement (One of them pointed his gun at me and did the gun shooty emoji thing), I think I was like low level 30s, I ended up dying a few times but then started taking them out, picked off the 2 stronger ones and started dismantling the rest of their group, then one of them was hiding in his house nearby, I used a powerfist and punched through a wall like the kool aid man and punched his face off. Fun times.
---
Yeah I have no interest in fortnite or even balanced gameplay.  I'm here for the exploration and the risk.  If one shot gankers ARE all over the place, then I'm going to be a stealth boy chameleon build and snipe super mutants for bonus exp or whatever I feel like doing.  It might suck, it might not, but I feel like people are being a bit too tunnel visioned right now lol
---
When I first load, I have to run to the side so that I don't get stuck under the house. Then I stand there for 2 minutes while my house appears. Piece by Piece.
---
Sometimes I have to interact with the terminal before he will give me quest.
---
I thought you had to be in the area as well. That was in a recent patch? 
---
Are you being killed by slap damage or by someone fire a gun? Did you see the person destroying your CAMP? 
---
It doesn't kill it, but it makes the animal spawns very very difficult to find.  I spawned into a nuked one yesterday and was able to finish it + get some raw cobalt flux in process.  
---
How do you know character location isn't mode dependent?
---
I feel like they increased his spawn chances, I‚Äôve seen him almost everytime I load into a world the past three days. 
---
PvP won‚Äôt work in adventure mode
---
It‚Äôs super cute!!! Just out of curiosity, how far are you into your budget? I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs almost up! 
---
That is a awesome camp
---
Aholes in the game think it's funny. Has been happening a lot lately. I have been unable to complete the event due to this disrespectful act.
---
I don't want fast travel at all.
---
I don't understand. You mean like they reset your location to nearest station on login?
---

Eh I earned my fuzzy costume more, I got mine from ghouls and a scorched

From an AMA:  
---
&gt;To anyone who thinks Game Devs are lazy:
---
&gt;SHUT IT DOWN.
---
&gt;92% of all game developers I know work their ass off. Game Development is not easy, nor is it quick. It's painstaking. And people don't seem to realize that Bethesda Game Studios (makers of Fallout and TES, specifically) is a relatively small company. The team who made Assassin's Creed, for instance, is four times larger than Bethesda's... and they don't have the huge landmass to deal with, the multi-class balancing of characters, hordes of monsters and dragons to animate, etc.
---
&gt;So yeah, I would say that team size is probably the largest restricting factor when it comes to game-making at Bethesda. The obvious jump-off answer from there would be "well they should just hire more people!" But hiring too many people too quickly is a really effective way of destroying team unity and cohesion, and a great way to invite corporate mis-management and such.
---
&gt;We had a great saying at Bethesda: "We can do ANYTHING. But we can't do EVERYTHING." There's only so much time and money and manpower to go around - we had to pick our battles. And you can't spend 8 years on a single game, just trying to get everything you want included and perfect.
---
&gt;They have a name for that kind of project... I believe it's Duke Nukem?
---

I think you are misunderstanding, with the current system you can grind down their ability to continue doing what they are doing through attrition.
---
In the new system you cannot. Of course they don't care, but there comes a point where they just cannot continue.
---
And yea, block/move servers is the best option unless you are doing something on that particular server that makes it undesirable, like a daily or you own built up workshops.
---
You just have to spam A to talk to him a few times and it triggers. 
---
how about in several months when a new player wants to join Survival? People will have stuff farmed from over several months.
---
This is one of the main reasons I started playing Melee and now I love it and haven't gone back. It amazing to never worry about ammo! 
---
Still not enough details lmao 
---
Lol 
---
Yes - you stay in PvP indefinitely currently.
---
If you take a workshop, hop servers afterwards if you are concerned about other players.
---
I would literally last 2 weeks max until loads of people are just nuking you with a shotty, and all those people who don't have time to build a new character won't play it or have fun because they just get murder when ever they play survival.
---
For the first 30-60 seconds the new tattoo parlor (Biv) doesn‚Äôt load on the map

I didn't see him destroy it, but I saw him hit me with a laser blast to the face the second I walked in the (locked) door. One shot to the head, instant death, in power armor. Second time, at that... no idea what weapon he was using to pull that shit off. 
---
I only assume he did all the damage to the camp because he was the one sitting there, waiting for me. 
---
Nicely done. :)
---
Something has happened to the plans since the previous patch.... Have been grinding for them as well with no luck at all!
---
is that the insult bot?
---
Godd Howard works in mysterious ways.  Praise Atom / Talos!
---
Well the XP boost would help a bit for those who want it quicker, maybe it could be more. Also TSE weapons and all that OP stuff wouldn‚Äôt be common at all and would feel really good to pick one up. But whatever happens is fine.
---
Why in the hell would you not make it a mandatory fresh start? Zero logic in this 
---
Wow. Thanks for the info. I'm still acquiring plans from workshops, so I'll utilize this tactic. 
---
Wow, that's rough.
---
I've had people (myself included) block the smaller bridge with a few frames for giggles (this one guy got *sooooo* pissed, kept loading clips into my head with his lever gun). but never to the point of try to genuinely force the event to fail.

It's funny to see some people overreact, but shit man. Wasting rolls at the ultra rare masks is just stupid.
---
I‚Äôm now level 69 with about 9500 lol
---
I agree with the  start a new game sentiment, since the game's character menu only has 5 slots, it should make sense that you could do two characters per game mode, and then you can choose whether the 5th slot will be survival or adventure, but you really shouldn't be able to switch characters between game modes, for one, immersion, as little of it as there is, essentially shatters when you can take your tank from Adventure West Virginia to Survival West Virginia,  it confuses the shit out of me when I think back to the Vanilla Fallout 4 system, where, if you switch from Survival Diff. down to Very Hard, you couldn't go back to Survival(mods help with that but either way, it's single player, no issue really with that,) but why the heck AREN'T we going to be forced to start a new game? I've kicked off over 100 different runs on Fallout 4, I have no issue going through this storymode again if it means I get to start out at level one with everybody else, instead of spawning in at level 1 or . 2 and there's already the highest level adventure players who switched over just carrying on in the Cranberry bog or the Mire!
---
This Fasnacht Event has proven to me that people are willing to work together, trolls will always exist, but if a whole server can follow five robots around in a big circle, maybe we can follow each other around checking off story missions once again, my MAIN POINT is why would you want to switch characters over when there's 'NOTHING LEFT TO DO IN THE GAME?!' Start over, pick different perks, EXPERIEMENT! IT'S A SIMULATION AFTER ALL, FO76 IS COOL BUT IT'S NOT REAL LIFE, YOU'LL BE OK IF YOU DIE A FEW TIMES AT THE BEGINNING, IT'S A SIM-U-LA-TION!
---
Yes it is. Lol
---
Yes, people do sell serums that cheap. 
---
The serum recipes used to be affordable. With level 3 hard bargain perk, they cost like 19K. The price increases happened about two patches back when Bethesda made *most* plans/recipes available. I thought that was a great idea so we could cut down on server hopping. However, when they astronomically jacked up the prices on everything, it pissed off a lot of players. I had saved up almost enough caps to buy my serum recipe before the changes. In turn, the market for manufactured serums took off.
---
What a bro. 
---
I wasn't gonna build them for myself.   I was thinking of one of the ways to be a helping hand to others.  
---
Dropping power armor for new players
---
Giving weapons, armor, plans, junk
---
Now i was thinking of extractors so when a player sees one, they can go towards it.
---
But, i wonder if we could set each extractor to be color-coded?
---
My character doesnt know how or why the BoS formed. She only has very fragmented information given to he as she tred to penetrate Ft. Defiance. To her, they failed as they were too few, and despite thier want and need to save the world, in the end even the fiercest of them was dragged down alone. She aims to change that.
---
At first I was like maybe this will be a different post but then I was like no it‚Äôs not. 
---
Your change of heart isn‚Äôt relevant because BGS already said we can bring our characters over, everything you said can be accomplished by making a new one so I hope you do. 
---
Thank you for the reply. Did you use treasure maps? 
---
Very cool! Definitely has that enterprising "hey, I can use this!" Wastelander spirit.

I spent about four hours the other day hopping before I was able to get those two.

I think putting players in proper servers would probably be enough. As in like level 1-15, 15-25, 25-35, 35-50, 50-100, and 75+ servers would be enough. Y‚Äôall are thinking about the starting point, but at some point there‚Äôs going to be a level 200 with 20 weeks of reward weapons dominating the servers anyway. I don‚Äôt want to get rolled by that guy now, but I also don‚Äôt want to get rolled by them later either. I get that a new game experience could be fun, but it also just increases things to do endgame they way they‚Äôre doing it. My biggest problem with doing it the way that they are is that it‚Äôll be harder to grow with the mode, but maybe they‚Äôll also squash some high level problems early.

It‚Äôs beta and anything can change, just like the radios for the original beta
---
Someone I've played with gets challenged all the time I never have really didn't know it was a problem. I come here and see so many people complaining. 
---
The squeakers are my only issue when they get annoyed you won't give them something in
---
Trade
---
Same. When i get a butcher spawned, I find the respawn area for the squirrels and just punch squirrels to death for the remainder of the event. It's not like i'm needed for anything else in the event üôÑ
---
The same way "legendary enemies always drop legendary items"? Ignore the problem, make a statement that it's working as intended, when you receive backlash simply give everyone a "maybe next time". This is really disappointing and clearly ruined the first major event in the game.
---
Or maybe Survival should be where you go when you want to PVP, do the higher risk quests, or go to get the incentive gear they have planned, where as Adventure is where you go to recover from your inevitable losses. That way, instead of the inevitable decline as the less successful would-be PVPers quit and go back to Adventure or another game, resulting in empty PVP servers full of little more than trolls and tryhards, you might actually get people willing to play the mode who are not. People who can dip their toes into pvp instead of going balls out, getting nailed by bloodied deathclaw assholes over and over, and have to abandon their character because why the hell play on a PVP server if it's nothing more than a playground for the bunny hopping jackoffs?
---
You are always welcome :)
---
All of this sounds very promising. Let¬¥s hope some of the broken legendary effects such as bloodied and sentinel get adjusted (which might be what the damage overhaul implies) and then this will probbably be a great endgame activity. Outside of those two, one providing extreme damage and the other extreme damage resistance, the balance and builds in this game are actually fairly balanced. Regardless of low levels complaining, survival should be focused on the endgame, it should be where complex and well made builds are rewarded and this sounds like it will be just that. Looking forward to it.
---
20 but I have back problems like I'm 63, does that count? üòÖ
---
There should be a way for if a player is wanted for breaking a camp to be ‚Äúpardoned.‚Äù The camp owner can see what they broke, how broken they made it, and if they were previously wanted before damaging the camp owner‚Äôs camp. If the damage was clearly accidental, then the camp owner can give the player a ‚Äúpardon,‚Äù which would remove the player‚Äôs bounty entirely.
---
For people saying ‚Äúsomeone could just rack up their bounty and then tap the turret of someone‚Äôs camp and have the owner pardon them because they did almost no damage and it would look like an accident,‚Äù that‚Äôs why you should be able to see what damage had already been done if they were wanted when damaging your camp.
---
Bruh that was so earrapey
---
I mean I am pretty anti-grief myself but I am not sure this is a bannable offense.
---
I mean it is up to Bethesda but I can't see it here
---
100% agreed. Upon choosing survival mode you should start with a new character.
---
It will just grow the toxic "raider" community bullshit we have been dealing with.
---
Where the hell are you finding all these tech docs? Since patch I'm lucky to get 1 on the entire server. 
---
I definitely understand that it would be cool if you had a survival character and an adventure character, I'm just saying that the fresh player period won't last longer than a week or two anyway and for those who only have an hour or two a day to play aren't going to be able to keep up with the people who can play most of the day :/
---
Yeah Bathesda‚Äôs so stupid lol they can‚Äôt even spell their name right stupid Bathesda
---
Yes it will, workshops and other designated pvp areas auto flag you, and you can flag by returning fire as normal.
---
Platform
---
You sir are a treasure thanks for the special breakdown as well
---
So there is no plans to change the drop rate for the current event?
---
With the number of players attempting to get the masks its sad to see so few, to the point of questioning their legitimacy.
---
This idea is cool and they could fix this by turning defend waves into Horde modes, each time the wave goes up and they get harder. At some point you could have a dozen waves and even a scorchbeast show up. You might want to leave it before running out of ammo.
---
According to the polls litteraly no one has it it would prolly be 20k for it
---
Buy bobbypins from your mule to store caps.  If you don't have a mule.. go make one.  :)
---
I saw someone mix the hot rod paints with the nuka ones on different pieces... 
---
Would you have characters retain their crafting recipes in survival?
---
I don't think it's crazy tbh. Whether I am or not is up for debate :P
---
But look, this is exactly my point. If everyone goes into Survival mode with a fresh toon, there are no duped weapons or armor. You use what you find, and you gotta know you might lose it.
---
The way it's set up at the moment, it's just stupid. No consequence, and a field of elitist arseholes.
---
Now that I'm home from work and had time to think, I'd say no matter what else they do, they should fix it so you only stay PvP flagged as long as the person taking the workshop is actually capturing the workshop.
---
Additionally, don't extend the PvP-engaged mode to teammates unless they are also capturing the workshop. Those mechanisms are bad, and can only be used to grief people. It's straight BS that one person on a team can initiate a capture, and his teammate across the map will somehow do full damage to an unsuspecting victim.
---
And all the cheeses out sentinel assassins armor will make it pointless 
---
How much you willing to pay
---
This is definitely sounds promising but as everyone has been saying having to create a new survival character should be mandatory to avoid super unbalanced fights. This might give new players more incentive to play as well. Also maybe a system involving sleeping in beds to set a spawn point kind of like fo4 survival would be cool too. 
---
Yes, if (a) there was a level playing field, and (b) the rewards would be available ONLY in this mode (which they will not be - I can switch back to Adventure the mnute I earn them WITH the reward).
---
2000 caps
---
I haven‚Äôt yet bud, have been farming a bunch of them up... That said I‚Äôve got friends who used up all their maps and got nothing sooo
---
I keep reading things in these posts that make me think I've missed some official announcement.  Does anyone have link to official info?  Specifically looking for details of risks and rewards of playing survival.
---
The desks in the Enclave bunker is a good spot for them.  The room right before the military wing.  I still find at least 1 each visit.
---
I hope someone will bring some good news, thank you for the information 
---
it's a solution, but i'd be glad to see good solution from devs
---
That's the funny thing about certain lighting conditions in this game. 
---
Right? Let's me see your weaps! 
---
Are u ps4
---
A lot of bugs have been fixed, but there are still some. The Nukashine quest is really well made imo. The parade was kinda underwhelming, but I think it's worth it to give the Nukashine and the new content coming soon^tm a try
---
That's how it works in adventure mode - you're logged in to the fast travel spot at the nearest POI you've discovered. If those spawns are disabled it might pick the nearest eligible point, or you might login to different locations depending on where you logged out of each mode. It's not really fair to criticize a mechanic we haven't even seen yet.
---
There could be different xp gainers so I think different characters per game mode 
---
Yeah, I'm pretty close xD ([https://i.imgur.com/kXAQNrJ.png](https://i.imgur.com/kXAQNrJ.png))
---
Thanks God turrets now consume far less budget. I couldn't have one before. I don't know how many times my poor brahmin got killed by supermutants :(
---
I keep getting ammo, stimpacks and variations of scribe uniforms when I turn in technical data. Tempted to buy or trade the plans off someone.
---
what platform?
---
I used to avoid other players' CAMPS at all costs. One day I helps a low level player out at his CAMP while it was being raided by super mutants. Gave the guy a stim when he went down, then started tearing up the muties with him. One stray 10mm shell hit a wall in the guy's CAMP and I was wanted. Not 5 minutes later I was one-shotted by a level 150+ player who took lead and ballistic fiber from my corpse. Punished for trying to be a bro in the wasteland. I'm glad Bethesda raised the threshold for such offenses, but I'll admit that my experience made me avoid the social aspect of the game for a while. I agree with you, OP. The nature of a player's crimes should be "Wanted Poster"ed on their icon so we can know what sort of griefer we're dealing with.
---
If you want to do exploring then why would you be playing survival? Why wouldnt you start a fresh character anyways? and Why wouldnt you shit all over noobs?
---
Indeed!  Mules are a huge pain in the ass.
---
Is this a feature? 
---
Pc
---
Maybe I‚Äôm lucky but I haven‚Äôt had a technical document in ages but do the quest every time I log in without fail. 
---
Forgot to say PC
---
Bug
---
My bad. Forgot to say PC
---
How much 5mm?
---
I don't understand why you are defending this as I doubt the creators would want no one to experience their designs. This is supposed to be fun and enjoyable, not gated and exclusive. 
---
Oooh. What can I do for the 5/5? :(
---
Is 1000 ok?
---
They announced changes to pacifist mode, you can‚Äôt attack, be attacked and your camp/workshops can‚Äôt be broken 
---
Flamingos
---
I have just send you the friend request
---
In my opinion - yes. All character's knowledge should be with him.
---
I'm logging on soon, I'll see what I have. Don't think up to 1000, but I'll see
---
Ok so it sounds like when you have a workbench you're in PVP mode. I thought you had to be in the area. 
---
As for your CAMP it is possible he let scorched or something else destroy it. I've seen videos where when you go to a CAMP it can spawn Super Mutant's etc. A player can either get on your roof or simply hide around back and they will focus in on killing the CAMP. 
---
I watched a video where a single wolf destroyed an entire CAMP with a player just watching on the roof. 
---
Again, no idea if this is what happened but this would explain the destruction without the bounty. 
---
I‚Äôll be on soon too. My ign is the same as reddit
---
So do you plan on fixing the drop rates for this even because I am yet to see anyone have a rare mask in game and I‚Äôve played the event like 50 times
---
If you go into market 76 there is a table in a post from bout 2 weeks ago with over 50 traders on PS4
---
How do you have two characters from one account active at the same time?
---
Does it hurt?
---
Except for the top 3 players that have lived the longest. Essentially punishing people for not dying.
---
I think it's more you're ignoring his point, people who don't want to fight others shouldn't be made to, and people who do will be able to meet in survival. The former doesn't want anything to do with your 'raiding'. 
---
With all the commotion around this, I was thinking something similar. Players still have their levels/perks, but it at least levels the playing field from people who duped a bunch of items
---
Nah. Fuck that. You're just encouraging grind. If someone is no fun to fight, just fucking block them forever.
---
You don't.  You have to have a friend available to hand things to while you switch characters.
---
I've played this event about 10 times. I am a pacifist. Last night at the bonfire someone killed me. I couldn't even respawn. I had to reboot my system to get back in the game.
---
I agree that it's not completely fair. But it's easy to abuse going into adventure mode, rushing to that waypoint and switching to Survival for the added XP gain. And that's assuming you create a new character. 
---
If you're a mid leveled character it could be exploited if you have discovered the location prior and just fast travel to that point the switch.
---
If the workshop right outside Poseidon is occupied and making fusion cores, if I sprint fast enough from Charleston I can get to the fusion core processor before it loads and pick up a fusion core off the ground for free and unpunished. That level 3 lock or whatever loads after I've already grabbed it. The door to the Poseidon you can walk right through also.
---
I go out the building and then back in, seems to fix him
---
I 100% agree with the original post.
---
I've been looking forward to survival being a hardcore version that we wanted from the start.
---
But now I don't Bethesda will deliver.
---
I want a mode where when you kill a player they respawn in another server. With no fast travel. And no swapping perk cards on the fly, it should cost a level to remove a card.
---
I agree. I don't get a whole lot of time to play, if I had to make a whole new character and start from level 1 I wouldn't even consider trying survival. The way it's set to be now I'll at least give it a go every so often 
---
Yeah, maybe that was a bit lazy. The straight sample just wasn‚Äôt working; it‚Äôs a horrible noise but makes the jump scare. 
---
Wait a second how did you get that excavator paint??
---
Like those?

Can I have my 5/5 now?

Its been there so long i just forgot about it..
---
*Viable RP path*
---
I suppose you'd be the one initiating unwanted PvP in this scenario? Other people's experience shouldn't be ruined to maintain yours. Survival will work fine for a raider 
---
Imgur is usually your best bet
---
I had 147 of them, got the quest and poof they're gone... I totally agree with you. 
---
Sorry, I must have missed it, 5.01 / 5
---
Which is why we shouldn't be able to go from adventure to survival with the same character. 
---
I see so many tech doc's I don't even bother picking them up. 
---
Survival comes in less than a week, they can't change it now.  Plus what about future modes like Nuclear Winter?  If I have to start a new toon for every mode I'm just not playing them.  I work a 9-5 plus have a social life outside of the game.  This would be irrespective of people's time in a genre that already doesn't respect people's time.
---
The perfect example of "That's going to leave a mark."
---
It's the same system literally every game with hardcore seasons uses. Do you not play video games? 
---
If I understand right, the leaderboard will tell you exactly who's in your session, so you should know if you're alone.
---
Also the top 3 are always visible on the map, so you'll see 2-3 other players, plus any bounties. 
---
Same thing happened to me this past weekend. I picked a lock in a workshop not paying attention and became wanted. I realized that the workshop was taken after the fact, so I just went to the overseer's camp and stood there waiting for someone to kill me. 
---
1001
---
:D
---
How are you keeping your food from spoiling?
---
You do not have to be in the workshop area to be flashed for pvp. People have been exploiting this to "roleplay raiders" and hunt down unsuspecting people. They don't even have to capture the workshop, they just have to start to cap it then they or their teammates will travel to you on the map and proceed to kill you and destroy your camp.
---
Like was mentioned, best bet is to leave server when you're done with the workshop. 
---
Personally, I would prefer to just have legendary effects disabled in survival mode. It simplifies balancing mechanics and keeps the simplicity of rolling a character between game modes. The issue described here doesn't go away by forcing players to roll new characters, it just lessens the prevalence of it happening for a brief time. 
---
Nobody wants to be insta-gibbed. It makes more sense to have weapons and armor limited to their standard variations so players cannot gain outrageously unfair advantages against one another. 
---
As a raider, yes, that is what you would be doing, raiding.
---
It is a fallout game about the apocalypse, it needs raiders in all modes.
---
You're a wizard, Harry
---
Everyone should either: 
---
1) start over 
---
2) allow for perk re-spec 
---
3) eliminate all duped weapons and armor 
---
Leaving things ‚Äúas is‚Äù will be an absolute shit show.  You will have a small collection of folks wreaking havoc and the vast majority of players have zero incentive to make the leap.  
---
To make this new element meaningful you have to even out or strike some form of competitive balance.  
---
But he‚Äôs not. He is talking about a mule character, which 99% of mule characters aren‚Äôt over level 5 and have no weight reduction perks. But hey maybe I was wrong, but I strongly doubt it.
---
Honestly I can't see the point in XP boost when we have separate characters for modes. But it has sense with one character (so we go to Survival for more XP).
---
Where's your CAMP. Giggidy
---
Unless you are flagged hostile or in an area that flags you, which can still totally happen even in pacifist mode
---
Where is the building where you decorate?
---
You stay away from me with this knowledge. I don‚Äôt wanna die! 
---
Slap damage in Adventure is being set to zero according to In the Vault.
---
Assuming when you can give them a stimpak when there on there knees you instead devour their face?
---
I've been showing off the same fit to everybody lol
---
No surprise there‚Ä¶
---
You're saying you finished the event and it gave you nothing? Or you couldn't finish the event?
---
‚ÄúIt just works‚Äù
---
Add Stabilized under Intelligence. Increased accuracy and ignores 45%of armor at Level 3. I don‚Äôt think you need power user as fusion cores are easy to come by. 
---
Y E S
---
WHY didn‚Äôt they make everyone start from scratch on the PvP servers, rather let let every duper keep their ill-gotten OP gear!?
---
fasnacht is amazing! so silly and fun, in on of my runs a player started to do a dance next to the bonfire with the crouch pose. Soon we're all doing the crouch dance around the bonfire
---
But we know some players didn‚Äôt work hard.  They acquired gear before the nerfs or duped it themselves.  That explains how some lvl 40 dude can beat a lvl 150+ dude.  It still happens today. 
---
This is gonna be awesome! Zero slap damage. Zero CAMP damage. Existing characters can fork to Survival or Adventure. Trapping all existing characters in Adventure would discourage people from playing Survival if that is the true FO76 experience they have been waiting for. It‚Äôs fair to both server modes. I can‚Äôt wait! (But I will until the passifist CAMP patch to Adventure. Then I‚Äôm all set! My dad and I can finally play together. He‚Äôs new to Fallout and multiplayer and just can‚Äôt deal with CAMP griefers or PvP.)
---
Can you reveal how many of the rare masks have been dropped per console over how many hours or reveal the drop rate? Are certain rare masks more rare than others or are all 5 equally rare and able to drop?
---
Half of our group bum rushed Grahm while the other half guarded the first position.  In the end everyone took turns hitting Grahm up.  IMO the Responder Vendor Boy is not only easier to find but typically carries at least one or two rare outfits.  Graham‚Äôs inventory can vary in quality significantly.
---
You can go to the game file and launch from the main exe if needed.
---
I've tried 20 hours but he always makes me wait 24 from the last time, which is annoying as it's getting a minute or two later each night.
---
I would like this just for those rare times I find myself with a bounty, and had no idea what I had done...   Had instances where I encountered no players or bases in a session and still found myself with 5-10 cap bounty/wanted.     
---
Which I then just run strait at the closest players I can find hoping they kill me so I can resume my antisocial farming :)
---
I would 100% support this. Legendary effects really are the true issue
---
So go play Survival with all of the other pvpers? Or are you just angry because it‚Äôs getting harder to grief people?
---
The event never completed. It just never finished for some reason. 
---
They likely do it because most people have no idea how to counter the sentinel build, and it lets them slaughter those people like sheep.  Since sentinel applies even while you jump in place.
---
But like you say, a casual vats crit will do the job, but a majority of people don‚Äôt even try it, crazy.
---
Except the way this is set up and described would not seem to indicate a mass exodus of griefers to the new PVP platform.  
---
Seriously the people on here are buttery soft, go back to the sims if you just want to play house
---
Simple, eat it before it spoils then hunt again. Actually now that you mention it megasloth mushroom soup will be a difficult thing to keep up, same as the meat.
---
That‚Äôs up there! I have my camp settled on a hill in between McClintock and Sutton Station. I rarely have any hostiles, so I only need two low-level turrets, but it does get a little too quiet sometimes. No Brahmin to keep track of, though! 
---
I really would rather not start all the way over
---
remember it grows on trees. is yellow if it's bloomed. 
---
Duping is over. That excuse isn't valid. 
---
You would think they'd have a better option.  Like holding triangle to trade (PS4) you should be able to hold a button to request PvP.  They accept and you get a 10 second countdown.  They don't and you try the next guy.  People get PvP and the folks that hate getting slapped don't have that aggravation.  
---
Are you speaking on behalf of all the people you can see here who complain about unwanted PvP?
---
Just face it, you want a power fantasy, and there's plenty of single player Fallouts where you can do that, and this new PvP mode, where you can aim to do that. 
---
Leave people who are going to choose Adventure Mode alone, they've made it clear by choosing it that they're not here for that, your 'RP' be damned. 
---
Yes. I think we need some compromise solution which would be appropriate for both sides.
---
They said it would be like this. Rare means what it means. And they said very rare. It doesn't just mean a little hard to get. Damn-near impossible does seem to fit the bill.
---
I mean, I get it, I'm a 100% person, too, but you've got to be realistic about your expectations. It is meant to be a bit like the lottery. 
---
I think at least we should have our character looks and no gear ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
This wasn't thought through.
---
Might just scrap the meats and turn vegetarian as it is easier to maintain
---
False! I can here to see an owl playing a tuba, and was not disappointed.
---
A lot of people enjoy the struggle of getting to a high level despite all the risk.  It cheapens the accomplishment of you can choose to ignore the extra layer of challenge when you want - think about hardcore mode in New Vegas and FO4, or if you‚Äôre playing something like Conan, Ark or even Minecraft and just turn on admin privileges or creative mode for a bit.  You can no longer truly claim the achievement of ‚Äúmaking it‚Äù all the way to where you are currently.
---
So far i have no legendary gatlings so have not had a need to fuel one requiring the extra cores/ammo.  Now that I think about it I only seem to ever get melee legendary weapons and its dam annoying as I have a stealth sniper/rifleman build.
---
And me! It seems to be a common thing. I didn‚Äôt realise it was the property of anyone. Maybe there should be some kind of clue since it seems to have happened to quite a few people 
---
I'm glad about this change, I have never been low level when there are high level people around because I started at the beta until yesterday when I made a new character. Long story short I got killed by slap damage from 3 level 80 players.
---
Agree with you. Thinking out loud - If you ‚Äòlevel over‚Äô, the next time you log back in you‚Äôre placed into the next higher group - not perfect but a better option? Past experience has shown me that it‚Äôs almost impossible to stay logged in for an extended time without the game crashing etc LOL
---
I totally don't. I RP BoS, but people who legit play raiders need a path to do that. This is a fallout game, they are part of fallout.
---
Looking for 1k caps, or if you have any other neat stuff I could trade
---
It's not like it has the chance of dropping anything useful. It's 35.
---
Pretty sure you‚Äôre still wanted on whatever server your switch to. I was only wanted once and I did this and was still wanted, unless I was unlucky enough to go back onto the same server 
---
Yeah 900h guy
---
I wouldn't even mind a damage-perk-card-disabled for survival. For a true even playing field with minimals "legendaries" or any, so it's more of a realistic survival experience that you can go toe-to-toe with others
---
How much do you have and a price?
---
Downvoted for nefarious enclave propaganda. 
---
I imagine fraction perks. Like MODUS orbital supply drops for Enclave from your pipboy or Robot squad reinforcements from the responders. 
---
I stayed on a server the first night and didn't get any mask or plan repeats, but it was probably just good RNG juju. 
---
Sweet. I like hordes. 
---
Character transfer would be silly.   
---
Heck survival should be almost 'hardcore' by default too.     
---
You start with nothing.  And if you die...  well.  don't.
---
Eventually if you survive long enough you get to 'save' and be safe.  ish.    
---
No I mean if you get trapped in a base just swap servers, not shoot your way out
---
You need to be 'looking into' this NOW and making adjustments BEFORE this event ends. Some of us would like to have a realistic chance of getting the rares. It is pretty damn clear that the drop rate is far lower than community expectations to the point of them being unicorns. Something needs to be done or people will be dissuaded from participating in future events on the expectation that this will occur again. You want kudos and positive vibes from the community? Fix this yesterday.
---
They had trouble for a long time keeping people‚Äôs damn skin inside the power armor frame instead of on it, and that one‚Äôs still only partially fixed!
---
This.  I‚Äôm lvl 150 and I‚Äôm way more concerned about the lower levels that found a way to get the killer builds and gear in some cases through questionable methods like duping.   I started the game well after it was released so worked my way up through a lot of grinding.  I‚Äôd be interested in making the visit to survival but given the layout I‚Äôm not sure I will.  Good to see there is another option. 
---
You whiners think that a reset will help you? It‚Äôll take two to three weeks before people who grind hard can run a sustainable build, then they‚Äôll be back to murdering you and you‚Äôll be back to complaining about PvP being unbalanced on here asking for BGS to nerf something.
---
He showed up in my parade too. Seems like Helvetia is a spawn point.
---
What coming battle (I definitely won't wright down notes to give to the enclave)
---
Ah sorry I misunderstood 
---
It‚Äôs very much reminiscent to the ‚Äúwe are eliminating dupes but not really because you can still keep at least one version‚Äù 
---
Yes the one we are in
---
I can answer that question. It's because the people who didn't want the slap damage to be zero were happy and had no reason to make posts about it. Now that it's changing, they've voiced their opinion.
---
It's different people talking.
---
Bethesda should make sure future updates introduce less bugs.
---
Downvoted for inferior T-60 power armor
---
Can I go and perform some research in your CAMP also JESUS CHRIST this is a Christian server!
---
Should be home soon
---
Well fortunately for them, there's gonna be a whole new gamemode where they can attack people flat out, and if they have an issue with people who are willing to fight back they should go back to singleplayer experiences.
---
Ignoring a PvP server to find PvP in PvE is just looking to grief at that point, or would you disagree? 
---
My guess would be its not that easy of a fix.  If it was "simple" beth might be able to do it.  Also, if they were to chge it, people would still complain that they played the first few days and were unable to at the end for some reason and they would still complain it was not fair.  Overall, leaving it as is but acknowledging they need to reconsider drop rates on future events is good!
---
Either rifleman perks in perception if you have spare points or get a 50cal, gatlin or lmg &amp; then you can just swap in the heavy gunner perks under strength. All 3 are pretty good now since the buff.
---
Yeah, that would work if I had installed FO76. But that‚Äôs needs to be done from the launcher...

Which I cannot log in to...

Read this as ‚ÄúThank you...NOT! Fuck you Bethesda‚Äù and was about to downvote 
---
üòéüëçüèΩ
---
Sounds like you were too slow to catch a glimpse of the Sheepsquatch!
---
Oh hell yeah that way when I get a workshop just to build I wont get crippling anxiety whenever someone comes remotely close to my workshop.
---
Thanks everyone, I'm gonna try now üòäüòäüòä
---
Like he said, it‚Äôd be a dick move if they said one thing when the truth is the exact opposite, especially on a limited-time event
---
A couple explanations:
---
1. You had a workshop. It's easy to get you into PvP by exploiting the workshop mechanics. Even with pacifist on you can be killed if someone initiates the takeover of a workshop.
---
2. You were very low level or had hardly any health. Slap damage is capped at 5 hp damage per second. So they would have to do a lot of sustained damage to kill you.
---
3. You actually didn't have pacifist mode on and had already shot someone by accident, allowing them to return fire and kill you. Happened to me once. Took it off to clear someone's bounty for them and forgot to turn it back on.
---
There is a good in-depth post on here that fully tests the PvP mechanics and these are the only possibilities.
---
I actually haven't been experiencing that many bugs personally. My game runs and acts fine lol
---
I have one player over level 100. If I start this survival mode can I use a new character, same account and keep my other character for Adventure mode? The PVP has been bizarre for me currently, I'm curious to see this new Survival mode. I'm over level 100 now and some noob can 2 shot or melee me and I'm dead now? I hope this new Survival mode is better balanced :)
---
I think I've seen your camp if you play on PC! I remember marveling at a camp that looks a lot like this a few days ago, so maybe not fully finished.
---
I still need to grind out those signs, I want that "Electrical" sign above my generator!
---
Everything in this camp is great, looks very lived in and if not for some of the Atom Shop plans, from the outside it could be a building made for the game.
---
I feel as if this choice will have big impacts on both adventure and survival. People will only go on survival to fight, and then swap back to adventure to grind. The idea of all the PvPers being cut off into one server would be totally gone and you'd have to be dumb to grind anything on survival mode when you are at risk of just losing it all. 
---
&gt;Get the same stuff from workshops anywhere else in the game
---
So, is there a second munitions factory that I just don‚Äôt know about?
---
I can't aim as I have really shaky hands so I use V.A.T.S and ppl are learning that they can crouch so I probably will play survival mode for a bit to check it out then get my ass kicked by everyone.
---
Mine is under the New River Gorge Bridge (in Flatwoods), and next to my camp there's an enemy spawn, unfortunately. Every time I travel to my camp or any other player comes close they spawn. 
---
Sometimes they are supermutants, other robots, and other just wild mongrel or mole rats.
---
At least I don't have to worry about getting blown up by some nuclear warheads.
---
This thread is basically saying that the chance of a rare mask dropping are basically impossible since it's at .03%. 
---
Which would mean that the designers did that on purpose. Which means if that's true, then your statement about designers wanting people to enjoy what they made doesn't make sense. 
---
Either the designers made it so basically a few players get a rare mask, or that they designed so many people will enjoy the content. 
---
It's not gated and exclusive. Everyone, regardless of level can particpate. The chance to get a mask at all is based on how many robots make it to the end. 
---
Your chances aren't improved by what you do during the set up, how many creatures you kill during the parade or anything else. 
---
It's literally a group effort, that no matter what you have the same chance as anyone else participating. I once showed up literally at the end, and got a mask and the sausage recipe.
---
So why are you defending the idea that they made it so the chance of getting a rare mask is impossible? 
---
My point is this. The event isn't over. The poll that put out the .03% is flawed and inaccurate. We don't know. Making a big deal about it is pointless and shows how some gamers are very entitled. 
---
WTF are you talking about? I'm not talking about people who didn't or did start day 1. 
---
I'm talking about people who cheated their asses off to gain advantage over people who didn't. Not sure you are even responding to the right comment to be honest with you. 
---
What you should say that it is not your fault those players cheated to gain an advantage, which will be carried over into a PVP server, so you shouldn't have to suffer. I too would like to bring over my high level character that I spent hours upon hours grinding on, but I also realize that the cheaters ruined it for me, so it should be them your mad at. 
---
Seriously, its like everyone forgot how fucked up this game was for the first two months. 
---
Now that the duping is under control and xp exploits eliminated they should give us a fresh start in the new mode.
---
I find them all the time in those circular filing cabinets.
---
No.  It is worse.  
---
The event is fun... When the game doesn't randomly crash to desktop.
---
You've banned half your customer base
---
 Ram your signs up your arse
---
 With love
---
 old loyal fan base. 
---
I like pvp, just survival mode would be a good way of getting rid of all the duped stuff
---
Well this is the downside of the stash cap and building budget being raised which we were screaming at Bethesda for, right?
---
Alternatively, lock off survival until the player hits a level cap. This will ensure that all interactions will be much more fair right off the bat.
---
I was really looking forward to survival mode until I read you can transfer character, fast travel to train stations. And the bounty thing just seems like encouraging the loser to grief the winner.
---
I want hardcore mode!!
---
When you are killed by a player, respawn in a new server
---
Fast travel only to vault 76 and your camp, maybe your team maybe
---
Where your toon only exists in hardcore mode
---
No swapping perk cards on the fly, it should cost a level to remove a perk card.
---
Please put the RP back in my RPG!!!
---
I‚Äôve acted creepy and goofy numerous times, but never while wearing the clown costume and gas mask.  I think I‚Äôll do just that for my next game session, minus the griefing bit at the end.
---
...
---
...well, there was the one time where I wore the tattered skirt and played housewife, but that was for caps and I still feel dirty, months later.
---
That's litterally why many players are saying new characters only in survival so that they can play legit away from the duped economy.
---
Blocking robots in an event isn't griefing?
---
That is my usual farming spot. Get a good 10 tick bloods each time, and I do it multiple times per play session. End up with up to 200 stims by the time I log out like 4-5 hours later. Have to constantly transfer them to a mule because even with pharma phama 400 stims add up. 
---
I think you'll only get it again by making new bits. Mine is blackbird and the arms are original (the yellow &amp; black), I noticed If I took the blackbird off then the parts went to silver instead. 
---
Not a bad compromise 
---
God, for real. Doors being left open is how you get a family of radroaches moving in. 
---
I like to drop new players 1 nuka-cola and 4 stmpacks no idea why I drop those specific items but I do. I also like to help guide players though the abandoned waste dump for the Enclave quest as when I did it in the beta I was level 3 and it took me like 2 hours to clear out the deathclaws. 
---
My thoughts exactly. If you don't like farming masks, that's fine, but let the rest of us have our fun. Textbook description of a troll. People were really mad at the guy last night. Some very offensive comments were made about age and race. Wish I had a video as I'm sure there would have been some bans issued.
---
What's your gamer tag boss man sir
---
Do you use VATS crits or sneak crits? Crits bypass all armor. 
---
Hate to play devil‚Äôs advocate, but that picture is on a _phone_ of a PS4 game on tv.  Looks legit though, IMO.
---
I see what you mean, Well then what if the rewards you get depend on how much you contribute, the events should still be super hard and grand  so everyone can help but maybe there are things to activate like valves and stuff so that low level players who can't deal much damage and help can act as runners while everyone else protects them, allowing everyone a chance to help
---
I mean it obviously is causing some grief but you can nuke the place and not get banned.
---
this is the PSA I needed today 
---
Both, but it isnt 100 bcs i still do almost half hp without either
---
SYG Resurge , at the docs rn so it‚Äôll be a bit but give me a lil more time I‚Äôll be home but if you find  someone else it‚Äôs all good üëçüèΩ
---
So adventure mode is not a pve server, it is still a pvp light server
---
That‚Äôs a good idea. I don‚Äôt know why but not looking at the cards only remember shotguns being under strength. 
---
I like the item idea, and if there was that four player idea was implicated it would probably need match making 
---
40 here 
---
So i'm doing sort of this sneak-critical build; i have luck and agility maxed
---
After further investigation, i definitely do not have a prime receiver, so I'm not sure why my weapon was randomly showing different damage ratings. perhaps i had some buffs expire i was not aware of or something. I don't even plans to build one.
---
You really know how to hurt a man
---
The fact that it‚Äôs taking a picture of the TV screen makes it seem more legit to me. If it was an actual screenshot, it would be magnitudes easier to edit.
---
I think they should do a poll
---
Duping still exists 
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/YLlFysi
---
They are in the terminal outside the door of Fort Defiance 
---
looks amazing!
---
I am sorry to report, friend, that I was mistaken and do not in fact have any balloon plans for you. I will let you know if I get some in my runs tonight.
---
Mules can wear weight reduction armors and that alone lets you to carry around over 15000lbs of items theoretically. Big traders DIG lvl 1 weight reduction armor pieces and ones with weapon weight reduction is valued the most. I'm not joking when I be talking about a mule carrying around more than a thousand weapon pieces. Hoarders do that
---
Atomic shop. 
---
The way I got the mission done was lure the wendigo towards the mirelurks and they will fight. That is a cheep way to kill it/ get it low on health.
---
Ahh I see, my bad. 
---
I just completed the entire event solo, all bots intact and I got..... another witch mask haha
---
To expand, because this is a couple weeks long, I feel like the rewards will swap when week 2 comes. Like these old ones will no longer be rewarded but the new ones will. Like McDonald's and their Happy Meal toys.
---
"**The ability to transfer old Adventure Mode characters into the new Survival Mode is a mistake** **~~in my opinion.~~****"**
---
Fixed it.
---
Yea but the the people whos mode did not get picked would be angry but i think it would be better to add two different modes even with a longer load time
---
I would love to see basically just the Faction Wars mod/game mechanics from STALKER, but in this. Squads and all. It would be amazing.
---
Hour from start. So Bout every 40mins including time it takes to finish it. 
---
Hardly
---
No worries (: hope everything is okay. 
---
Yeah these would be awesome extra bonus of each faction
---
Yeah I've tried that a couple of times, either my lucks bad or I'm just awful. They ran by each other but both focus me. 
---
Just ignore the lore goons and do you man lmao.  I personally roleplay a mutant enclave super-commander who was the REAL founder of the enclave and have a blast with it.  if beth doesn't want to include many real interesting stories then make your own and have fun with it.
---
Just saw a pack of 3-4 Aussie / Kiwi chuckleheads doing this. Gets old pretty fast.
---
So because I have great gear, that makes me a cheater?
---
It's highly debatable, if dupers actually ruined the game or made it actually reasonable. Because back then you could buy TSE and basically everyone had access to it, but now only people who get lucky with RNG can have access to god tier weapons, unlike before when you could buy god tier weapons.
---
What part is ‚Äúunplayable‚Äù I didn‚Äôt quote any statistics. 
---
If you seek revenge I believe it marks em 
---
Same thing happened to me the day the patch dropped. Been keeping my eye out for horde events ever since
---
No random times. I server hop with another player not on my team untill we find it. We use psn voice chat to communicate. Usaually takes 2 minutes or less to get into another parade.
---
North of whitespring railroad station has a train car you can Incorporate into a store front . People tend to still nuke the crap out of whitespring still
---
I foresee a flood of complaints from players: ‚ÄúI only died because I forgot gear X was on my character only in the other mode and I missed out on the legendary so Bethesda needs to fix their game‚Äù.
---
I feel a new character should be required to play in the new mode.  Everyone starts fresh.  Those that want to power-level and grind for the best gear will do so anyways - experiencing the ‚Äúmore difficult‚Äù game from scratch won‚Äôt be much of a bottleneck or setback for them.
---
Ah yes. But in that situation it wasnt seek revenge. 
---
Just east of town on the road is a traveling spawn point. You can get hoards or any other random encounter that travels around.
---
Periodically pull out a melee weapon and hammer away.  Had the same problem you did before doing so and now ammo is a non-issue.
---
yeah, I've seen loads of players using explosive legendaries, but I've never ever seen a drop myself
---
you're missing the point, it would be as if being Master Guardian automatically made you take +20% damag. Being on the leaderboard will get you killed in this game, because you are highlighted on the map until you leave the board
---
I really wish you a happy cake day.
---
You sir sound like a fucking whiney ass bitch.  The reason you are highlighted when wanted is because you did something you aren't supposed to.  You don't get wanted for fighting someone, only if you're trolling them or messing up their base.  If you have trouble being wanted do the PACIFIST mode!!  
---
Also, you are just crying!  People who have been playing for months SHOULDN'T be required to start over after all the hard work.
---
Even that being said, you can TRANSFER items between character via a mule or a friend, so all those "God weapons" could just as easily be shifted from characters.  You pretty much made the worst complaint ever, with seemingly very little knowledge of the base game.
---
Even if you had to start a character over, you could just BUY or transfer items, including health items, junk, etc.  So what you're complaining about is kind of just dumb, because they would have to LITERALLY change everything in the game to prevent people from giving each other items.  You're entire post is flawed dude, you sound like someone who doesn't even play the game!
---
Yeah, I play on PC. If it was under the New River Gorge Bridge, that was me :)
---
I do have some plans called "metal signs". I've already given some of them to other people in this thread, but I have a couple of them yet. If you wanna come and grab them, they are all yours :)
---
The bad thing is that I don't know if they are for the "Electrical/Tools" signs or just for the "Restricted area" signs (Bethesda, why the hell did you choose to name different plans with the same name?).
---
Are you guys planning on making the event permanent? that's the only way this makes any sense. Otherwise it's kind of a kick in the nuts.
---
Just sent a request. I'm at like 980 rounds 5mm I don't use
---
That's what the plasma is for ;)
---
...with an emphasis on PvP that *both parties choose to opt into*, which your descriptions of 'raiding' do not align with. 
---
I've got nothing against jokey raider characters if someone's happy to play along, and believe it or not that's not actually under threat with these changes. 
---
Why would Survival mode be a boost?  Perhaps it‚Äôs less xp?
---
It exists tho and once ass/sent gear or AAE guns drops on PvP servers you can be sure someone will dupe it and it‚Äôll be SSDD. Maybe even worse since it‚Äôll be at a premium and only the people who can grind for tons of caps will get it. 
---
It‚Äôs a Beta, just let it play out and submit your feedback to BGS. 
---
13
---
5 are standard drops from the event. 
---
5 are super rare from the event. 
---
You can 1/2 more from the atom shop. 
---
1 is the original in game one. 
---
There's a week-long event with unique masks going on right now.
---
True
---
lol you are assuming they thought everything through. The most obvious and easy answer is they made a mistake. Having such a low drop rate for a one week event is a waste of time skinning and designing 5 items that 0.03% of the population will have. Assuming they set this as ultra rare like a tattered field jacket or red aslyum is fine in theory. However, they probably forgot about the limited time event, because they haven't done one. In any decent size company people work in silos. This is something very easily overlooked and I would bet unintentional. I would point to the fact that they have versioning patch issue which rolled back bobby pin weight as precedence to my theory. 
---
Your assumption that this was planned is naive and who said anything about entitled. I'd be okay with a 1% drop, but I would prefer a 5% drop as unlike you I'd want more people to be included and people to actually have fun. Alternatively they can leave this event on and leave the drop rate as bad as it is. 
---
There are 3 confirmed drops on this sub and the survey that is ongoing has a current drop rate of....... 0.03%.
---
It's not so black and white. There's pros and cons to having characters be transferable.
---
Overall though, I'd agree there's more negatives than positives in allowing transferable characters.
---
Thank you
---
You‚Äôd still have to calculate how much each item is ‚Äúworth‚Äù to you, or you still potentially have a cut-and-run situation.
---
Say I‚Äôm wanting a mediocre 3 star weapon you have and you‚Äôre willing to trade for a rarish outfit I have? Set the amount too high?  Go ahead and buy my outfit for 10,000 and then I could jet.  Set it too low?  Give me your 3 star weapon for 200 and then I could jet.  I‚Äôve see someone try this (obviously and poorly) with my wife when they wanted to swap items, but she‚Äôs waaay to smart to have fallen for it, lol.
---
Well, you say that but most of the time it's "some griefer one shotted me in pacifist mode" because one side doesn't know game mechanics
---
I think I just got lucky because on the 3rd or 4th time I respawned the wendigo was dead when I entered the cave and was able to collect the loot then died again.
---
Also having your Blood Elf Hunter send in a ‚Äúhuman‚Äù minion is sort of funny. 
---
fallout levelling mechanics are imo inherently a problem for pvp balancing, but legendaries sure do take it to a whole other level
---
There‚Äôs a new daily and weekly challenge:  Check For Yourself (Reward: Definitive Proof)
---
Thanks Juice! I'm thinking of making another in-depth analysis of how exactly these choices and systems will ( negatively ) affect the game
---
Real fallout players dont even want pvp. Assholes getting online to feel tough. 
---
I think so? If anything it might be a cap or 2 and thats far less then the loot you get. So far it's worked 100% of the time for me
---
Genuine question. How does disconnecting from a server and joining a new one impact server stability? 
---
I can get behind this. You keep your build, your skills, and your knowledge, but since everyone is getting their gear from scratch we won‚Äôt have to worry about TSE and impossibly armored bloodied death claw slappers.
---
Price has gone up? 
---
I think one thing everyone is forgetting is the ‚Äúprestige mode‚Äù thats still coming. I am sure it will even a lot of things out.
---
Or wait 5 minutes for your entire inventory to spoil. See the quick spoil bug is useful
---
Also works :)
---
like a mutated leech bug suckin off your face?
---
Yes. I was wanted for opening a supply drop I had a quest for. 
---
Tried to get people to kill me. Finally during Fashnacht a player realized why I was naked and unarmed and killed me. 
---
Yes ... that is precisely what I mean.  The amount would be negotiated during the trade.
---
The removal of slap damage is a mistake in my opinion.
---
Haha he is funny, he just doesn‚Äôt give up. I‚Äôm sure he was down in Charlestown.
---
They become legendary over time? Do you have any more info/link for that? 
---
I am as well...but its still a little care bear for me. No fast travel. No bounty. Respawn at train stations,base,or vault only...
---
Confirmed is a strong word XD it‚Äôs not like these items were cheated in by the developers room early. Most of them come from a friend of a friends aunt XD I hardly call them confirmed.
---
Vault Tec University, Sugar Grove and the safes in Flooded Trainyard are pretty consistent spots for me!
---
maybe lvl 20 and below?
---
I do, not because I want to feel "tough", I want high tension, risky gameplay.
---
I have the exact same problem. Reinstalled Windows 10 today and tried to install the launcher but it just results in the black/gray screen
---
I'll just leave this here: **[PvP in Fallout 76: What it is, and how it can be improved](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1djsNSmuRLbpNgyZauhhRQPl3lTSKv6NpKvjPbUPSETM/edit?usp=sharing)**
---
If you go to places like Watoga station you can find the vendor selling these. Mostly from players selling after nukes.
---
A man of culture I see. I'll spend all of my caps there as I am an alcoholic enthusiast both in rl and in game, and you can listen to me get drunk over the mic while my character goes unfazed. We'll have some good conversations.
---
finally I got by scrapping. ty.
---
Well then you could go to regular and get the boosted xp 
---
I assume depositing one at a time I creases your chances over 2 at a time?
---
This, not heard of this before so more info would we great.
---
My apologies, I‚Äôll post here if I do somehow get a rare drop :3
---
Yep I agree. Nowadays it is just people looking for PvP. But with the new mode that might at least reduce the amount of people looking for PvP at workshops. But if you are taking a workshop then you shouldn‚Äôt be upset if someone else takes it because it‚Äôs in the game for a reason
---
People don't kill them for scrap lol. They kill them because A) they're hostile to Phoenix, B) they're hostile to the player until they do the Watoga quest, C) it's an easy spawn location for challenges that require you to kill robots, D) for the XP.
---
I just said aloud as I handed it in. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon give me the paints, please‚Äù and I got BoS Knight. Maybe you just need to be polite?
---
That‚Äôs the only BOS mod you can get by scrapping, the rest are thru plans.
---
I may be wrong but it sounds like the only time you lose caps in survival is if you chose to use yours to set up a bounty on the person who killed you. That‚Äôs how it sounds in the blog post.
---
Ambient occlusion is really bad in 76, outside  it's not  as noticeable,  but once you're inside, it gets really noticeable.   They did  something  with it that you can see pixelated  grids on the edges  of  objections where  ambient  occlusion  does its thing,  and at worst,  sometimes  it'll even cause noticeable shimmer on environments.
---
They really should have just left it alone from Fallout 4.
---
OMEGALUL

[AlphaReds](https://www.reddit.com/user/AlphaReds) found a solution using an old version of the launcher and saved the day.

Check out this thread  if you encounter the problem:

Thanks again to [AlphaReds](https://www.reddit.com/user/AlphaReds)!
---
They respawn...a bot won't eventually become legendary. It either spawns as legendary or not.
---
He's right, they do become legendary! 
---
Not true, by doing a hard start on the pvp servers, then it allows all current players to have an equal start, and keeps the previously over duplicated items out. Also, this would not be a reset to one game mode, this is a brand new game mode or server type so it doesn't upset anything. Jumping from pve to pvp truly does give the people with more in game currency and time to play an overwhelming advantage since they can farm all of their materials, get set up then hop to the pvp server and demolish people that are playing the way it should be done.

I run a bloodied.buuld that astounds my friends who PvP more. (I only engage on friendly terms or to assist a friend who's under attack.)
---
Counter me with radiation. A base-level gamma gun ends me in two zaps. 
---
Too scared to get that close? Wise.
---
One Nuka Grenade has the same effect.
---
Great bar, thanks!
---
That actually worked I just got the Knight 
---
Why is it that every "screenshot" of the rare masks looks like somebody took it with a Polaroid? There's a photomode, at least use it.
---
This is the perfect time to rifle through every drawer, cabinet, table,container and every other surface in your house looking for screws, lead, plastic, etc,.
---
It definitely changes things up. It‚Äôs a pretty game. I never notice much cause my character uses the chameleon mutation and I‚Äôm always invisible 
---
And what does a 'raider' do? Define the playstyle you're currently defending. 
---
Also *one side doesn't know game mechanics*... you mean new/casual/chill players that haven't read enough into griefers bypassing game mechanics to know that when they specifically toggle the '*no PvP, ever*' option are the ones at fault? 
---
All I can say is flatwoods is going to be a shootout all the time. Especially if people do power through at low levels. Can't see how quests will get done, so that's probably why they're allowing transferring of characters.
---
I didn‚Äôt even know you could do that. I haven‚Äôt dyed any gear so I wasn‚Äôt aware you do each piece individually 
---
I note the servers are back up haha. Just in time for bed üõå. Damnit.
---
Add me...gt same as name 
---
The player-based economy is in for a wild ride once Player vendors are implemented, anyhow.
---
Yeah that looks awesome. It was pretty dark under the trees in Helvetia and I didn‚Äôt even see the ‚ÄúNuka Quantum ‚Äú logo on the armor 
---
Also fun and don't forget easy Legendaries
---
Cash 1 in for loot, it does not make a difference. Upto 3 for the extra xp and caps. The xp and cap boost caps out at 3.
---
I'm going a bit crazy trying to find the tech data. Used to be able to grab 3 or 4 a server, since latest patch I am really lucky to get one. ("farming" enclave bunker, sugar Grove and vtu)
---
I think you are overestimating the number if players in this sub vs subscribers to this sub. I bet more of the subscribers are not active players. 
---
I may be downvoted to oblivion for going against the reddit hivemind but I still heavily disagree - Not all of us have the time to being able to grind new characters for hours a day.
---
I was *very* lucky to have the time to do so with the character I have now. It's the *only* character I play, and I put plenty of time in to building him up *solely* because I knew that if I didn't do so then, I'd have to deal with all kinds of griefers who had 12+ hours a day of spare time on their hands to grind characters to ungodly levels that I could never hope to match.
---
I see griefers bullying low-level players all the damn time in this game, and I do *not* want to go through that shit. Right now, I'm high enough level to not have to worry about people harassing me and I was very lucky to have the time to get to where I am now, but I don't have the time in my life to "start all over again" and I know I can't be the only one in this scenario.
---
Nah. That's not how survival works. You gotta deal with thales fact that you might run into a big fish 
---
Personal experience (I live in Watoga and have spent nearly 500 hrs in game there), you can check for yourselves, just watch the Protectrons for a bit, they will eventually start glowing green and morph into a legendary. Sometimes even a 3 star legendary if they have been left alive long enough.
---
"General area with in reason"
---
Perhaps I‚Äôm behind in times - is the ability to change modes at will official?  If so, I think that sucks.
---
And that‚Äôs a great point that I‚Äôll keep in mind for future reference, but that assumes that I want to participate in PVP in the first place.  I‚Äôm more of an explorer than a fighter with perks going towards carrying all the stuff I find, so when I get one or two shotted by someone I didn‚Äôt even see, that‚Äôs what can be annoying 
---
I like going Cammando it's quite refreshing
---
Getting on now.

Hahaha whatever dude. You can't win against the Reddit elitists. Sorry you're scared of PvP... 
---
That bos jumpsuit too! damn you lucky fuckin bastard
---
Tinker's Workbench, funny enough I'm on this quest too. 
---
You can hit the glitched dead body?
---
So we don‚Äôt need to be letting robots die, as the Bethesda streamers said the other day?
---
Since the last patch, I crash to desktop quite often.  I did not have this issue before.
---
You‚Äôve just described me.
---
Aa far as I understand it, a dataminer looked at the code, and the rare masks have a 0% chance of dropping due to an error in the code. They may plan on changing it or it might just be a mistake, but the rare masks dont drop at all right now 
---
It‚Äôs just gonna be all jumpy TSE/melee one shot bros on the list :p
---
You missed a 0
---
Mines just randomly started working after 3 hours
---
üòÜüëç
---
you cant target people who are crouched?? 
---
People constantly logging in, disconnecting, hundreds/thousands looking for the event constantly, forcing the server to remove CAMPS, rebuild them, constantly, seems like an increased server load to me.
---
What is your ign? I dont see a request
---
Hi look another one of these post. 
---
Added 
---
I have a witch mask myself, I'm pretty sure what I saw was the goblin mask.
---
All Survival items should have a special tag so you can easily distinguish them from Adventure items. But I agree that it adds some more complexity to game (but I love complexity).
---
\&gt;  Everyone starts fresh 
---
A lot of players don't want to level up and collect recipies again. And I understand them.
---
\&gt;  Also, I‚Äôll be disappointed if characters are allowed to bounce between modes.
---
But if the character can't take any items from Adventure to Survival - what's the problem with bouncing in this case?
---
That was a misunderstanding of someone watching the stream - the streamers said that you should avoid letting the robots die to improve your chances.
---
Lol alright bud, keep thinking i'm a shitposter and everyone who has something negative to say is being self centered. I'm sure bethesda appreciates you blowing sunshine and roses up their ass
---
Asully102 
---
Thanks for all the love and support everyone! I really hope my message reaches Bethesda and they get the proper thanks they deserve for the devotion to provide us players with this game!
---
I‚Äôve had a busy day so I didn‚Äôt get much time to respond, I don‚Äôt know if editing my post notifies you guys but I just wanted to let you guys know I really appreciate this! 
---
I‚Äôve got one 750caps 
---
Lmao :)
---
If levels and gear don‚Äôt equal hardcore I don‚Äôt know what does. No casuals are running around as level 400 with god tier weapons/armor. I‚Äôm done
---
I don't believe you can. If you can it must be part of the very rare ones because after well over near 100 runs I haven't gotten it.
---
Oh no. Oh no no no no, I've played WoW more than enough to know how this ends
---
This is your typical "dont forget about me post" and offers no relevance. 
---
If you dont like the game, dislike it quietly so the rest of us can enjoy it. 
---
You do realize it's not the main body right? It's Bethesda Austin aka battle cry studio 
---
I think the game saves your location as the last land mark you visited so you would be teleported a small bit of you server hopped
---
You're hype since day 1 also doesn't count as a source, sorry. 
---
I watched the end of the stream, and at minute 50 and the guy said something like, ‚Äúso if you‚Äôre not getting other masks maybe you need to let some robots die.‚Äù
---
I'll keep that in mind, thanks!
---
They order a baby on Amazon?
---
I have my bloodied handmade from a ghoul,not copied and not traded from someone else. You're not forced to play the new mode, it's the same as always just without pvp rules. You won't lose anything
---
Good riddance.  For those of us who like it as is and can‚Äôt wait for it to get even better, you won‚Äôt be missed.  Yeah it sucks when it crashes or when enemies don‚Äôt take any damage, but it‚Äôs easier to just learn to deal than be salty and hold a grudge.  That‚Äôs just not healthy
---
As is we've had ten thousand tested drops, *and* those ten thousand haven't ever seen the rarer masks being worn, other than the *single* confirmed case.
---
That confirmed case is also one of the "rare" masks - as by datamining, we can see there are two tiers of less common masks, "uncommon" and "rare". "Uncommon" masks have *literally not been seen in a hundred thousand times,* considering that there's probably ten other people in any given run of the event.
---
Does "one in a *hundred thousand*" sound like "uncommon" to anyone?!
---
Sorry looking on map for it 
---
I think if this were the case I would never touch survival mode. Why do I want to lose my 500+ hours worth of grinding to hope for some random RNG drop?
---
Youll notice its called survival, not pvp deathmatch battle royale.  Why you keep looking at it that way I don't know. I don't need to kill everyone I see, neither do you lol.  (and you wont see them that easily, they wont be on the map anyway)
---
So, you're thanking them for changing to a "Games as a service" model?
---
Celticcrossbone
---
Where In the camp? I've checked everywhere and can't find it. I got it free from the atom shop as well.. And it wasn't in wall decor or anything. 
---
The problem with that is that it‚Äôs only a short term fix because in a few weeks their new characters will be level 200 gods as well.
---
May be you missed this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3rxsl/inside\_the\_vault\_survival\_mode\_beta\_overview/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3rxsl/inside_the_vault_survival_mode_beta_overview/)
---
Thankyou :]
---
Hates gunna hate.
---
Bethesda did screw up really bad at the release of 76.
---
BUT
---
The servers are actually doing amazing now [XB1] 
---
The game seems to be heading in the right direction now that they've dealt with one of the biggest issues.
---
The new content they've been adding is really fun, It's going to take awhile to get this game to 100% especially with all these no job losers that play games 8-12 hours a day complaining every chance they get. 
---
If you really hate this game, uninstall, unsubscribe to the sub, and move on.
---
The endless circle jerk is getting tiresome
---
Interested in a couple serums. Won't be back on for a couple hours but will send you a friend request.
---
Oh god please don't let this start a clown epidemic!
---
Take my word for it or not, spend some time there and you'll surely be proven wrong. Have no idea why you or anyone else is getting upvoted without even checking for yourselves. I'll be waiting here for you to admit you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
So extend the event by another few days/a week. Not complicated.
---
Or people that just avoid everybody well. Until inevitably becoming a target for everyone. Not everyone that is interested in this survival mode wants it just to be a deathmatch.
---
I'm with you, but most people are asking for a full reset and I was thinking maybe this would be a happy medium? I don't know I have my best guns, and my best armor. I have thought about doing it all over again but to be honest I just don't feel like leveling up and picking all my perk cards again lol
---
Triangle above him means you had marked him with a recon scope. Perception factors in drtection range of enemies and supposedly helps you notice enemies in stealth. Agility is your own stealth factor. 
---
What. No keep the characters the same 
---
Why
---
I will test this tonight, thanks! Currently I kill them because they respawning fairly quickly but if they indeed change then I will change up my play pattern there. 
---
Still hanging around, huh Felicia?
---
BYE!
---
I fail to understand how this will prevent greifing or provide fair ground, you know that ppl will group up and power level up to lvl 100 within 2 days and be fully geared while others that have full time job will be level 10 and still running from gouls, at least now you can get powerful and only join when you are ready.
---
You both have a point. However I do think this drop rate so way to damn low for a limited time event. I've done the event almost 100 times now and have yet to get one of the rare ones or see anyone with one in game. These drop rates would be fine if it wasn't limited time but it's such a short time frame to get them.
---
Unfortunately this idea, while good, is only a short term fix. One month from the start of fresh character survival mode we‚Äôd be back to square one high level gods running around.
---
Hmm I haven't done much server hopping but I've thought it only displays players who were on your current server, or if in main menu, those who were on your previous server. Not from several, but again, you mainly would see that when server hopping so I don't know.
---
It just no longer separates players who are currently still on that server, to those who left.
---
How long? Not doubting you, genuinely intrigued, I farm legendaries and watago is one of the areas on the loop and this would be a literal game changer. From a 1 to 3 star for example? 1 Hour? 
---
Yet again- it's your choice. Yes, you can switch to easy mode. You can make a new character that doesn't use any gear from the other characters. You can do WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO. 
---
You're just trying to force everyone to play the way you want to. Which completely defeats the point of an rpg
---
They should straight up call it PVP server instead of Survival
---
Just a few hours ago loaded myself in Whitespring with the intent of going to hunt for some ghouls. Walked inside the golf club and when it was empty, I thought it was just cleared when suddenly ghouls started to spawn all around me...not nice.
---
One clear indicator seems to be that, if you have the radio on, when the music starts everything else has completed loading.
---
I hope it still happens and r/fallout will lose their shit over lore
---
It‚Äôs not a glitch it‚Äôs a feature
---
The burden of proof is on you, my friend. 
---
There has never been any instance, any proof, that there is a mechanic in this game that causes an enemy to become legendary over time.
---
The way it seems to work, is enemies spawn in an area, and each area has a chance to spawn a legendary enemy. There's code and calculations happening behind the scenes that determine these chances. 
---
Until you can provide proof that this exists, no one has any reason to think otherwise. 
---
Online petition time?
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
Very cool! 
---
2 Players can just farm each other for infinite caps then
---
Thanks so much. Feel free to use my junk and lead extractor as much as you want at my camp. 
---
Where is this referenced from?
---
\*Fallout new vegas flashbacks\*
---
Ya I understand rare and I respect grinding for in but because it's limited time event it's to low.
---
Ur welcome....anytime u need help...just call
---
Sounds good!
---
Detection range as in if i have low perception it will take me being really close to someone to detection them? And if my perception is high then i can detect them from farther away? 
---
Good god, they are selling for 2000 ca0ps? 
---
You're wrong, people kill them because they don't know what I know. Test it before you claim to to be the authority on this subject. You will be wrong, most people don't have the patience or attention span to stay in Watoga long enough to see them glow green and turn legendary. Test it. I dare you.
---
One update is likely going to be in that forested area across the river you‚Äôre next to. I have a camp on that river and it kicked me out with that prompt if I go like 1/4 into the river with my boundaries. Try just moving it around, slightly. Worked for me. 
---
Lol yeah I'm stopping until they buff teh drop rates.  I have like 5 of every mask right now, i just drop the plans on the floor.  Now.  At this point I feel like I should get a complimentary "rare" mask lol
---
A lot of players want more challenge without a challenge, then.  Imagine the challenge in starting from scratch in Survival mode!
---
If items weren‚Äôt transferable, that would improve my outlook on this, but I didn‚Äôt read that in the blog.
---
The only decent reason I've seen with this is the Survival exclusive weapons and making it so you can use them in both modes. I can't think of a good way to make that work with completely separate characters -- maybe make it so every week there's a danger zone in Adventure Mode where Survival rules apply? I don't see that working logistically, though. 
---
I forgot to ask this on your first post, but it still applies because I see the same instance here. What mutations are you looking at? I ask because you can get by without class freak depending on the build and serum(s), but when you're dealing with multiple mutations it makes a huge difference.
---
go play Fallout 4 you chode 
---
Bandolier, Light Footed, Batteries Included, Awareness and Good With Salt are useless. Ammo is very light, and you'll never have enough for their weight to become a problem. If you get Awareness in perk card pack, keep it as backup but no need to keep it equipped all the time. Good With Salt is also not needed as you'll cook and eat much faster than food can spoil, and there is enough food available so even if food spoils, you can always cook more. Also spoiled meat is very useful with the Carnivorous mutation. There aren't enough deadly traps in Appalachia to justify Light Footed. here are my suggestions:
---
Bandolier -&gt; Pack Rat 2
---
Awareness -&gt; Grenadier
---
Lose AquaBoy and put the point in Agility, then Light Footed-&gt; Action Boy 2
---
Batteries Included -&gt; Demo Expert 3
---
Good With Salt -&gt; Luck of the Draw 1
---
Which would require someone have it, to trade.
---
Thanks! I hope that Bethesda will find the compromise.
---
On the bit?
---
It's not true that you can't be hurt while the event is running. I had to get a fellow parade goer to kill me while naked to help me drop a 10 cap bounty I got just moments before for collecting my own quest supply drop.
---
It was early in the event, right at the start, so maybe that changes in later stages, but I was definitely killed.
---
By being fanboys, you let Bethesda get away with this shit.  
---
Stop being fanboys.
---
Thanks i'll give it a shot.   just so weird it just decided today just to boot me.
---
Today's Inside the Vault.
---
Thats why we need Bethesda to come out and say something. Leaving us in the dark is terrible.
---
By being a fanboy, Bethesda gets away with this shit.
---
I remember. They complained until Felucca was a vast lonely wasteland... there was hardly anyone left on the PvP side until Origin got smart and created incentives to go to Felucca and face that risk. Better gear from legendary creatures, new lands with new challenges AND better materials gathering on the Felucca side. 
---
You could travel back and forth at will... it changed nothing about balance, it didn't give anyone any kind of advantage. If you wanted the good gear, you went to Felucca and possibly faced someone challenging you. 
---
If you didn't want to go, you stayed in Trammel... it made no difference whatsoever. It just gave people a choice and it ended up being a pretty smooth transition.
---
I don't get what everyone is so afraid of?
---
Yeah, I posted a pic of it on my account 
---
You on Ps4? 
---
Good god let's not give people reason to nuke the place it's already noticeably unpleasant to have to leave the event to avoid a nuke.
---
Thanks for the tip. We have been killing them because a legendary will sometimes be built in its place. If you do the loop over and over, you get quite a few legendaries in a very short time this way. Have to see if it's faster your way. 
---
There's only 2
---
Because of fanboys like you, Bethesda gets away with this shit.
---
I'd buy it
---
Yeah, the behavior was kinda shitty, but I expect a bit of that now and then. I was unaware though of the work bench mechanic that allowed it. That's rather annoying. 
---
 post actual odds for us to see Bethesda 1:X  
---
"attainable" just like the lottery right? 
---
They wont because they don't want to admit this is another mistake...
---
Next time it will be different.... just like every issue... 
---
Great PR guys  
---
It probably won‚Äôt be a lot of caps. Maybe a bit more than a super mutant might drop. The most caps will probably still come from bounties. Plus, nothing will stop other people from killing you both. And the real rewards are the aid items now anyway. 
---
Regardless, it‚Äôs safe to assume the rules won‚Äôt be the same as they are now. 
---
But you‚Äôre ok with the hairy-legged housewife sporting a kickstand?
---
I dont think most people want a full reset. I think there are a couple hundred people on here, who are probably newer to the title, that want a full reset and probably because they dont have nearly the time as the ones who have been here since launch and still play do. No one in their right mind who has got (most of) the gear they want after grinding, trading, and selling for 6 months wants a full reset of their main character(s). If Bethesda came out and said everyone had to start fresh that would be a different story but to say all of your gear transfers for months and then change it would make tons of people not even touch the mode and ultimately would backfire on Bethesda. 
---
!!!
---
That‚Äôs very generous of you! I‚Äôm the same name here as I am there. I‚Äôll look you up later!
---
How long do you have to leave them for?
---
It's hilarious and if someone puts the effort and resources into launching a nuke on the figasshat parade, kudos.
---
I LOOOOOVE this game!! üòÄüôèüòç
---
Thanks! Worked perfectly!
---
I agree completely, people should also consider that 90% of the assets, aside from landmass, were ripped straight from fo4.  A ridiculous number of bugs have been carried over from fo4 and previous fallout games and many of them still haven't been fixed.  The release reaction may have been overblown but a large portion of it was also deserved and IMO Bethesda still has a long way to go before fo76 is in a AAA state, the state it should have been in at release.  Gaming companies as a whole have been releasing lower and lower quality products with the intent of fixing them later, sometimes they actually fix them sometimes they don't, this behavior shouldn't be rewarded so I understand the outcry.  Preorders shouldn't be a thing in a day of digital downloads.  Consumers are just as much to blame for the lowering of quality standards as companies are, WE SHOULDN'T BE BUYING SUBPAR products.
---
you can't nuke it when event is already started because nuke can kill robots, but if you nuke it before the festival...
---
Ok, so if you don‚Äôt like what they do, tell them. Don‚Äôt just rant here and then give them the silent treatment.  Plus the game still works a vast majority of the time.  I play on Xbox and get maybe one crash every other week, if that, and haven‚Äôt experienced any ‚Äúgame breaking‚Äù bugs in almost two months 
---
Yeah, but that doesn't change the fact that I want either the goblin or death masks. If you've looked at them when the robots are wearing them, those two are cool! (And the sun is disappointingly derpy)
---
&gt; Survival should 100000% start out with everyone on an equal playing field,  
---
Under your proposal, the playing field will be even for  about a month. After that,   you will have level ten players in a server getting obliterated by level 80 characters who have acquired legendary weapons and have fully fleshed out PVP builds. 
---
At that point, being able to build your character in adventure practically becomes a necessity just to survive. 
---
Shouldn't those they're destroying also do the same? Who says Survival mode is meant for "playing the way it should be done."? Isn't that Adventure Mode?
---
My comment above is that duplicate items still exist. The fight is with duplicate items. This just tries to cauterize the wound and not heal.
---
I have BlackBird on arms and legs and camo on chest. The plain silver looks good as well instead of camo. 
---
You can mix them anyway you want
---
I was planning not to get any mutations if at all possible, although I suppose carnivore plus herbivore would be useful...
---
This is the logic people are missing along with forcing new characters being only a short term fix of only weeks before the dedicated players are full power again.
---
Yup! Mine is working now. Thanks mang
---
Thats not news at all
---
Okay i think it's gonna be more like arenas or warfronts from mmos. If people like this week's reward, they gonna join survival mod, get the item, then go back to playing adventure mod. You're overthinking this
---
And because of haters like you, this reddit has become a toxic cesspool 
---
i really hope so
---
Yawn.... 
---
That's where your perspective is incorrect. I am a fan boy that has no problem telling them what they have done and do wrong. Did you buy the game? Ok then by your logic you are the reason they are getting away with this? You you thing a little post and an uninstall is going to hurt them or keep people from playing? 
---
Be disgruntled in quiet. No one cares how loudly you cry. 
---
Yup, it's pretty is how someone can take their level 300 character into survival mode 
---
Bethesda.net seems to be down, at least according to other people on reddit.
---
Still I don't know what is happening to Bethesda, they went from an awesome company to one riddled with bugs round every corner.
---
How about all of your aid and junk items are not transferred when it‚Äôs Adventure&gt;Survival, but they do transfer when it‚Äôs Adventure&lt;Survival
---
Seriously, are you just in this to say the same thing to everyone?
---
I'll be on later tonight if you still want help. Schmity78
---
Thanks for the info! I just use the standard lol
---
Bethesda please please separate adventure and survival servers 
---
Yet again, just saying the same thing over and over
---
I believe what you are saying and everything.
---
But I also like hearing them pop and they don't shoot at me so I will continue to shoot them üòÖ
---
So you think people kill them specifically so they don't turn into legendary enemies? Since they kill them because "they don't know what you know"? You sound insane dude.
---
You already missed st Patrick's day
---
It‚Äôs like a broken record at this point 
---
Assuming that you can aim (hit the engines, preferably), one point in each Rifleman perk and three points in Bloody Mess is enough to take down cargo bots reasonably quickly with a hunting or lever rifle. Pistols are also workable if you're running really low perception.
---
Heavy gunner swap-in won't touch your SPECIALs, but the accuracy might be a pain. Stabilized as an extra swap-in should help. I haven't used heavy guns much personally.
---
So they force new characters and you now play survival mode, but for how long? It will be only a few weeks to one month before those same god-like players are now fully geared up again. Then what was the point of a fresh start?
---
So I can't Play Fallout 76 right now?
---
It is not only upper managment and board but also marketing dept as they realize market studies and decide when a game has to be released in a very concurrential environment and this without taking in consideration the current state of the game.
---
Stop being a hater and play games for the reason they were meant to be played: for fun
---
Yup, I think it's pretty dumb how someone can take their level 300 character into the pvp servers with no problem. 
---
Yea alright i can see them having at ya like vultures in that case.
---
Burden of Proof is on you. Let's see some video of this happening.
---
I usually don't even waste time on these kinds of people/posts.
---
Today I got a bit of time. 
---
What exact bugs are you talking about? You seem to talk, but offer no intelligent solution. 
---
*Edit - "because i didnt get the attention i wanted, i had to make a side note about the fan boys who are having more fun than me. Its all their fault i suck"
---
Sorry your edit needed translation.  
---
Yes. I don't know the exact figures but that's what the descriptions say and it seems true enough. Someone might have hard numbers somewhere. 
---
You're right about the overthinking. To be perfectly honest I am thoroughly excited for survival mode. I feel like I have spent so much time getting the build, the weapons, the armor, and resources that I want and I am so ready to test them out on others who have done the same. I just was curious what people would think of this. Even I am not entirely sure I agree with my post haha.
---
Stab shit with a combat knife whenever possible. Eventually you'll have lots if ammo. Also, whenever you have 200+ energy ammo, use an energy pistol until all of that energy ammo runs out. 
---
Collecting steel, lead, gunpowder while using those tactics nets me 1000+ rounds of 5.56
---
I‚Äôm wondering if we are going to get the wallpaper and stone walls then two. 
---
Here you are look, a pic of the guy in action;
---
[https://imgur.com/23DoFDD](https://imgur.com/23DoFDD)
---
So this was at the Helvetia bandstand - at this point he was still funny - he was basically walking up slowly behind me with an axe so I started playing the trombone and he swung at me - managed to get a pic mid-swing :)
---
That's my bad, I thought it was sorry.
---
Whether you believe me or not isn't a burden, proving me wrong is your burden. I have nothing to lose or gain, this was just meant as a PSA more or less, take my advice or not, either way it's true, it's up to you to see that.
---
I think it should pair people up based on play time if they are going the route of existing characters. 
---
Us filthy casuals are going to get killed. A lot.
---
Good for you.  I mentioned the posts in this forum being mostly about game-breaking bugs.   
---
How do you know I have not told them?  
---
The game works a vast majority of the time... for you.  
---
Thank you for ignoring my point and replying in a typical fanboy knee-jerk reaction.
---
It works now for me
---
Only 12 hours real-time.
---
Get a Combat Shotgun and Enforcer perk. Boom, almost instantly cripple anything you aim at.
---
Im on PS4 but I remember getting help there when some guy waltzed in and oneshotted the wendigo with a TSE weapon
---
I'm glad you have no say in the development 
---
Same. I was mid build the other day and a wanted dude with a 225c Bounty came up, did a heart emoji and there was some one following him, I didn't know if they were trying g to trick me or something but I instantly logged out in fear of them destroying my stuff or killing me. 
---
Good idea... In theory though. 'Cause you'll get that guy who'll scrap the entire workshop :/
---
I accidentally built my camp right on it. I‚Äôve had a supply crate spawn inside my camp, had robots stuck in the floor talking to each other, and lots of other random things. Also lots of destroyed parts because of the random enemy spawns 
---
You are not alone. If half these people spent more time building up their character than complaining, they too could have god roll items. Usually when someone doesnt want to put in the work, they just complain and drag everyone who did the wok down with them. 
---
Your tolerance for such shitty games is why companies continue to get away with this shit.  But, whatever, keep sucking that Bethesda dick.  I mean, how dare I complain about a bad product!
---
See the thing is they have the choice is also yours to not make a new character for survival, your just forcing people to play in a economy and style alot don't like.
---
The actual developers are not the culprits here. They are doing their best to make this game work with what limited manpower they seem to have. That isn't the issue with Bethesda. The issues stem from just about every single decision that was made with the game being wrong. From marketing, to balance changes, to suspensions, hell even release date was wrong. The BETA was wrong. It wasn't a beta it was early access. Todd Howard telling us that there was no NPC's was a fucking TERRIBLE decision. 
---
Blame the people at the top lining their pockets, while the poor bastards who have artistic vision get stifled. Could you imagine being a developer on 76? Do you think they are unaware of all the issues? They simply don't have the manpower to fix everything in a speed that needs to be done in a live services game. Same exact thing happened to Blizzard. Look at the state of World of Warcraft. 
---
You can't put all your money into the pockets of executives and hope your talented people put in 60+ hour weeks to make a product remotely viable. I feel for the developers. That is a way harder job than anything I can do. I'm not even nearly as talented as these people. Game's aren't about fun anymore. That is second priority behind shareholders.
---
Dude, that‚Äôs your eyes bugging out and playing tricks on you.  
---
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but wasn‚Äôt your point that you felt that the game is in an unplayable state?  If I missed another point in your argument, I apologize.  I still feel that personally the game is good.  Could it be even better? Absolutely.  What system do you play on if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?
---
Or else the ones who have god tier items spent hundreds of hours obtaining them, hundreds of hours testing various equipment, and know they will be able to farm caps on god-builds within a week from fresh start, except anybody who has lots of life responsibilities will be unable to participate in PvP now as they will need months to get their stuff back.
---
I definitely think that getting rid of my god items - along with god items of everybody else - would put hardcore players at an advantage, and the majority of the players at a disadvantage.
---
Not to derail thread topic but can you gimme a quick rundown on how you farm technical data?  I've not dug too deep into it BUT you peaked my interest a bit lol
---
Who trolled first?  Looks like that was you, TexanPirate.  So, yah, you are the toxic one?
---
Correct
---
Dear lord the servers are utter CRAP as of late.  The new events + nukes must be making game incredibly laggy.  Last night was a nightmare! Crazy long lag and disconnects.  This morning was horrific as well.  Picking up loot took like 3 seconds to register. I didn't even try and run whitesprings more than once because the lag was so bad and constant 'server not responding' messages.  Bethesda, spend money on more servers or make server optimization your #1 priority to fix -- especially when introducting a bunch of new stuff which will bring all the people who left coming back to tax the servers.  
---
This game is unplayable with the servers flaking out this bad.
---
I've got better things to do than wait &amp; see if a protectron will turn into a legendary.
---
If I have a challenge or event that requires me to kill robots I will come in and destroy Watoga bots until it is complete &amp; if I'm lucky I get a couple of crappy legendary items out of it.
---
Other than that the.bots are all yours.
---
how about instead the level scales with your character? but everyone starts off at ground zero.
---
All i hear is one attention less cry after another. Ya know what would show us? If you deleted you game then broke it! Gosh that would really show us!
---
I have always a radio (appalachian or classical) playing through pip boy selection. Is that what you've asked?
---
Yup, no idea what they've been smoking. Horrible design decision.
---
\&gt;  If items weren‚Äôt transferable, that would improve my outlook on this, but I didn‚Äôt read that in the blog 
---
It's my suggestion here. Bethesda suggests free switching between modes with no limits (with all items available in both modes).
---
\&gt;  Imagine the challenge in starting from scratch in Survival mode! 
---
But you can start a new character - and it would be even more challenge (if you compete with high level enemies :)).
---
Thats the best case scenario but Bethesda's has been unchanged on their opinion for months.
---
What trolling?  I was providing my own viewpoint on this topic.  How is hating something less toxic than just talking?
---
Mules...Ass...lol
---
I'd shave your points off starched genes if that's the case. You'll mutate once in awhile but radaway and decontamination will get rid of them
---
Yikes I‚Äôd never want to play something like that even with my shitty gear. Can‚Äôt imagine it would be popular. 
---
You have some anger issues, dude.  
---
I am sorry you are satisfied with sub-par products.  Why do you feel the need to fanboy, though?
---
No one is forcing you to play in any style you don't like. Just play any way you want. As for the economy, there's still duping methods, and they will always find more. Forcing new characters won't fix that.
---
You could also, you know, not buy items from other players since you said that the reason you play is to loot new items. You're contradicting yourself, which is pretty much proof that you're just bitching for the sake of bitching.
---
Suggestion: If characters end up separate for each mode, tag them like modded saves in fo4.
---
e.g. Timmy [S] is a Survival character, whereas Bob [A] is an Adventure character
---
This!!!!!!! Exactly this!!!!!
---
I suggested this way back when they announced survival mode. There needs to be separate inventories for Survival and Adventure modes. That literally fixes all of the gear problems survival mode will have.
---
Retain levels and all crafting recipes. Just 0 gear and only basic entry level supplies.
---
We should be able to tar and feather people as a punishment. And march them down the street or around white springs.
---
I know for sure I have seen one. It was horribly ugly. One mask I don't care if I ever receive.
---
I still need like 475. Hopefully they fix the daily quests.
---
You can post the video when you have the patience and will to be proven wrong.
---
You entirely missed the point.  Get over it and move on, dude.  Apparently, you'll never get it.
---
If only you could dupe it 10 times, you'd break even.
---
You think this game has been out for 4 months and you are the first person to ever discover a mechanic for spawning legendaries? No. 
---
You made a claim that no one else can corroborate, and you have zero proof.
---
Nah, not gonna take your word. And I'll keep killing all the robots just because.
---
üò¢
---
Saint Turing heard you.
---
Maybe there's one hidden behind all the toddrays.
---
&gt;It is only going to be a fresh start for two weeks.  Any new players after that are screwed.  
---
That's exactly what I'm arguing, and frankly, I think that's the goal of the "you need to start a new character for survival" crowd. 
---
They'd love to rocket up to level 80 and then make caps killing level 30 people. 
---
I do this everyday, I'll first go to the Enclave bunker, steal their tech data, and then head to Camp Venture and give it to the Boss, I've gotten the bomber jacket(X2), science scribe, Feild scribe, officer under Armour, and the BoS Initiate (X2)paint. I figured after getting Initiate once, next paint would be Knight, but I guess not. Need that Elder paint. I'd really like to see an in game Nuka paint for T-60, I mean x-01 has one now and T-51b has one. I know they're just assets from FO4, but I imagine they could make something neat for the T-60 set. 
---
This is really upsetting, I've done the event like 30 times now and all common ones, my plan was to grind them till I got the goblin one but I guess that's not happening
---
how is this acceptable? stop actively trolling your own community and fanbase
---
Petulant child.
---
Then please tell me what the point is?  I‚Äôm open to learning and you are very passionate about your opinion so I‚Äôd like to hear your side
---
Especially when the solution to their problem is so easy for them: If they are worried about being outmatched in Survival, they can grind up all they want in Adventure mode to prepare for that. Problem solved.
---
For the bonus 20% exp to gain more levels so you can do the higher level content?
---
I don't know what the incentive behind Survival mode is. The weapons they showed off are not very good for the most part. Fine low level legendaries, but nothing top tier. Is it literally just so I can go completely raider and kill anyone on site?
---
&gt;Bethesda
---
thanks for the shit sandwich. tastes shitty.
---
Then the little animals you need for intestines don't spawn in town and you can't start the parade. 
---
Why are you still here? Oh thats right you uninstalled your game so now you are clinging onto the reddit page for.... some... reason. Since your assumptions speak miles on your intelligence maybe you should go find a new game... and page... to cry on. 
---
That would be awesome, but chances are pretty slim.  Fo76 wasnt meant to be a single player game unfortunately.  But I'm with you--that is what I wanted also.
---
Together they look like destroyed NCR Ranger Combat armor 
---
Why are they taking away "slap damage"? It takes 3 minutes to kill somebody and all they have to do is run away. 
---
I actually had this happen to me again the other night, popped online to kill a few legendaries in my farm spots, and one was diseased enemy, but he dropped a legendary. A second or two after the legendary showed in his inventory, its name changed from "Diseased" to "Legendary"
---
I sell all of them on Xbox for 100 caps each. GT: Exponenttulip38 
---
It's cosmetic armor and goes over your actual armor. You're able to still wear your limb/chest armor pieces but no longer costumes such as dresses and such.
---
He must not know how social media works...
---
Yea definitely
---
Yea I misread, with player to player i dont think you could, in vendors you could without a doubt.
---
Cool 
---
The best solution is just grouping servers by level
---
If I fast travel to the Bailey Family Cabin in adventure mode I expect I'd login to survival mode at Sunnytop Station, which is the nearest eligible spawn point I've discovered. There's no inherent advantage to switching when I can just travel there directly. The main benefit to this mechanic is that players will be able to set up bases in locations where other players can't easily follow. The only exploit potential I can see is switching to survival, spending caps to fast travel to a remote spot, spending more caps to move your camp, then switching back to survival to spawn there instead, but that's going to be tedious and expensive, it won't assist you in chasing down prey (since it will necessitate a server hop), and it assumes both modes will store the same location data. At this point we simply don't know how it works. For all we know they're just going to force everyone to spawn at Vault 76 when they first login. We can't very well suggest fixes when we don't even know what's broken.
---
https://discord.gg/kzXVZWe
---
Exactly. The majority of players want to carry old gear over, so I'm not too worried. Im just tired of people non stop complaining when they see someone else using the gear they wish they had. 
---
its called a tinker workbench you can craft ammo at...
---
Honestly I‚Äôm betting he just wants to try to stir people up and isn‚Äôt being serious so I‚Äôve stopped taking his words personally 
---
How is that a thank you all they have done is let people take there dupe guns ammo and armour in to a all new full pvp game mode is stupid 
---
Just like no one is forcing them to play survival they can stay in  adventure where everyone has perfect gear, also it would set back duping for now and if they followed most looters and did a wipe every 3 months or so it would both fix dupes in survival and keep it competitive
---
I'm not going to.  I have no interest in PvP no matter the details.
---
actually you can kill them anywhere and get intestines. Have done nuked Fastnacht twice already
---
Only thing I care about is not losing 100+ caps every time I get mob killed by sent unyielding bloodied builds
---
Hmmmm.... I guess the giant banwave and dupe purge just didnt happen. 
---
have one but i own f76 on xbone
---
Hi, we where having the same problem and found a solution, check:

Cheers!
---
I think it's great our characters won't be locked. And honestly if they were to be locked to certain modes I think people would still complain about that too lmao.
---
Or why not just give a scoped pistol the same fire rate and damage as a mini-gun?
---
All my wanted times came from accidently hitting turrets or resource collectors during defend a workshop from waves of whatever events. One of them took me almost a half hour to get killed to remove it because without the player markers I couldn't find anybody to kill me.
---
I did two parades in a nuke zone - other than the annoyance of using up my rad-x the parade went fine. Also got to load up on hardened mass/glowing mass/high radiation fluids. Found enough plants to make a variety of flux as well.
---
but issa multiplayer game
---
I dont mind really rare things staying rare. Its very good for our ingame market and trade. Its better a cosmetic be super rare rather than a useful item.
---
Try /r/Market76 you should be able to pick one up for 2-3k (there is one on bid now, current offer is 1k)
---
Lockpicked a door at the forest airstrip tower and got wanted. Went to whitesprings, looked for players and did the taunt + heart emoji. 
---
I've never found legendaries or anything like that in my lockpicking of lv.3 locks, but sometimes they have a nice selection of ammo and meds.  You should get it when you have extra points available.  I'm a lv.155 and I have something like 30 points available.
---
It was already the case in fo4 and it was annoying...bugs, bugs never change!
---
OK. Every time I crash, the server I rejoin just happened to have the event launching or just underway. Otherwise, I haven't had any server disconnects in 2 months.
---
You could also get a cheap usb keyboard, deffo speeds up messages 
---
What's wrong about having a mask that only a few hundreds people own. Its like a rare trading card with no combat value. People can show it off and it means that much more if you see it. WoW had dozens of items less than 100 players recieved
---
You'd still have like decked out level 50s or even lower in the lobbies. Let's just wait until the mode launch before we start suggesting things for it smh
---
Have you tried smacking it on the side?
---
Why not allow fun? Having to start a new character is just more busy work...
---
Thanks man ! I will try that tomorow ,now I'm just to tiried , must go to sleep
---
happens 1 hour after the last time the event finished.
---
Sorry for the late reply, I live in Aus - I'd be interested in buying 3-4. What serums do you sell?
---
The positives of starting over, no duped weapons, everyone starting at the same level, far outweigh the negatives, managing 2 characters. Level 50's without pay to win weapons are far less intimidating than a level 400 with them. Hell, I have a lot of respect for a  level 50 grinder and none for a pay to win try hard with mommy's credit card. 
---
Once players realize their troll techniques are ineffective in adventure they'll move on.
---
The only real negative would be based on what a friend said. Griefers want an unfair advantage, an exploit. In survival they won't have that and they may juat move on, period, to other games. Much of us may say good riddance but Bethesda's position will be to keep as many players as possible. 
---
Done it at least 15 times now. Just keep hopping.
---
I have the patience to be proven wrong. :( But I've had legendaries spawn right out of the pod, I've never known monsters could turn into legendaries I actually would like more info on this 
---
I found a guy with the moon mask in my game on Xbox. 
---
[https://imgur.com/QbB8h5O](https://imgur.com/QbB8h5O)
---
just to clarify, camps will not be able to be destroyed in both survivial and adventure as long as the camp is not hostile towards a player?
---
I hope so, cos I keep using it XD
---
The problem is that while the dupers were banned; many of their weapons/gear/ect are still in circulation in the economy.
---
Yes. Some level three safes can contain weapon plans (some that are not sold off the regular faction vendors.) There are also some level 3 locked doors that have plan/mod spawns, random weapon spawns and so on behind them.
---
I believe you are rewarded more xp the more you turn in at one time. So there is one positive to them being merged into 1
---
You say that because you only care about yourself. What about the people that farmed every day to get their half way decent gear over months and tirelessly posted on reddit to try to trade to get gear more fitting to them. 
---
Screw them and go separate in survival right. Not everyone dupped things to get their gear.
---
I‚Äôve done it 3x, no hopping. I just wait around and do other stuff. There‚Äôs always so much to do. 
---
I think it‚Äôs a beta for just this reason, they are looking for data on how the game would play out with a wide range of players.  
---
Also, the damage increase of all weapons will make that lowly vanilla hunting rifle quite lethal in the hands of a crafty marksman.  
---
I think when the full mode is released it *will* be locked toons. That‚Äôs purely speculation of course. In the meantime I‚Äôll be systematically transferring and selling off gear of my worst toon to delete and make a new character when the mode hits full release.
---
Probably yearly
---
I died 
---
Yes.
---
Nooo! Lol I got a kneecapper 10mm pistol on my first FO4 run and it ruined the game, could basically kill anything inlcuding Swan at a real low level. I see your point though.
---
I think that adventure mode should make just about everything co-op. From a lore perspective it never made sense why we‚Äôd suddenly start murdering the people we have known our entire lives immediately after leaving the vault.
---
Workshops should at the very least become a fast travel point for teams that laid claim. It‚Äôs so frustrating losing connection to the server, having your teammate get passed ownership (better than losing it like you do when solo!), and now not being able to fast travel or get any notifications when it‚Äôs in trouble. 
---
And also high level players just means you can get more caps off them
---
Yeah I'm a new player (level 12). If our characters carry over then I'm a dead man. I would just get one shot by the people that have played since day one. It would be stupid. At least give us a trading outpost where we can safely trade like runescape 
---
... you don‚Äôt understand what Burden of Proof means, do you?
---
Confirmed 
---
Posted exactly this a month or so ago. Would love to see it!
---
Yes. There might be plans or technical data in the safe. Plus, it helps in the nuke silos. 
---
Tagged as discussion but from your tone you seem rather closed off to discussion. 
---
They should up the chance for a rare mask based on how many balloons survive the event
---
Samee but I keep on playing 
---
The complaint I am hearing basically boils down to people dont want to fight players that have played more than them and have better gear. Why would Bethesda punish the players who are the most loyal and play the most? 
---
You're missing a lot.
---
Open your pipboy and look at the items equipped. The armor still there. 
---
Outfits do not replace armor, they hide it.
---
A multiplayer game that scales to high but not to low level players. One that constantly screws ypu over while you're leveling.
---
Issa bad multiplayer game. Might as well do something bout that.
---
It did happen, but people were wrongly banned and quite a lot of duped items got left behind and some items that werent duped also got deleted, like my vampire's boxing glove or my troubleshooter's explosive pipe rifle. Also people can still dupe items.
---
Lol, happy hunting and good luck!
---
Maybe it can be a thing where folks can repair anything that needs it and donate materials to generate workshop items that the owner has wishlisted. 
---
30 perks you could buy? Holy shit lol I‚Äôm level 79 and feel like I want so many more perks lol I‚Äôm set up pretty nice but I wanna have more variety in my weapon loadout 
---
You clearly missed the point to the meaning of rare. If your complaining because less than one percent have one. Get over it. If we all had one there would be nothing to salivate over obtaining.
---
For me personally there are lots a of reasons to play a mode like this, in fact it's what I've been waiting for to finally purchase the game. I'm pumped for the fact that it introduces an element of risk that I think is massively lacking from the base game. This is what online fallout was supposed be in my view.
---
Ohhhh sounds nice. I‚Äôve always been adamant about lockpicking in Bethesda gams but idk why I haven‚Äôt really touched it in 76 
---
This community wont be happy no matter what they do.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs ridiculous. I seriously hope Bethesda does not listen to the couple of hundreds who complain and downvote everybody who says otherwise. And even if a thousand people would downvote, this fucking sub is still the minority of the fo76 community. People in here have to stop to act like they speak for the whole playerbase. 
---
I like technical data. What‚Äôs there to lockpicking in silos? I‚Äôve only ran thru 2 times and both times someone launched a nuke before I finished the silo lol 
---
Agree 100000%.
---
Pretty sure it only happens to the Protectrons and Assaultrons who roam around outside or are birthed from their pods. Happy hunting and good luck!
---
Sentinel and Cavaliers are the only legendary sets that require you to use extra steps to kill them. Hense why they most likely will be nurfed, especially since it sure doesn't seem intentional whats happening. 
---
You can still utilize a monitor that has the crosshairs feature and use it like a TV, probably. 
---
That one is available from the atom store.
---
Actually that's so cool I'd call it a feature!
---
I have done it a lot of times, I already have several of each common mask and a bunch of plans. Just keep server hopping and hope that you get lucky.
---
Yeah I really hope they understand that this sub isn‚Äôt representative for the fo76 community.
---
Let's be real here, 5/10 masks being owned by 200 people is a fucking joke. this isn't WoW, this is a VERY casual game and the idea of locking half of event rewards behind a 1 in 10,000 chance is just ludicrous.
---
I understand the position, but I think that period is longer than 2 weeks based on all the changes made to the game and the differences in game play in survival mode. It is that period of time which could be amazing, unique, and very different than what is possible with the current design. 
---
There were a ton of XP and other exploits when the game first came out, and XP of high level mobs was pretty insane. The 20% bonus XP would help counter this, but it was pretty crazy getting like 700xp from higher level mobs before it was changed. 
---
I agree with you that there will be a time where there is a convergence between the current characters and these new characters, but would argue it is much longer than 2 weeks, and that time period could be a really amazing and unique game play experience. Imagine going to Flatwoods or any other quest area not knowing where other players are and dying means you respawn pretty far away and fast travel is limited. It isn't for everybody, but it would be so cool to do with everyone having a new character!
---
When you reconnected, was the Fasnacht event underway?
---
You mean people are upset about EVERYONE having a fresh start in a new PvP server?  It‚Äôs almost like the same ‚Äúproblem‚Äù ark had when they did something like this. People will get over it.
---
Oh, something like : the owner place a preview of the item in the building area and whoever want to donate material, can build it but nobody except the owner can scrap it ? Well it could work but building is really cheap already :/ (not trying to sound like a dick, just trying to find a solution :3)
---
It‚Äôs garbage to place and good luck making all of the conduits straight 
---
Cool thread there are no others like it.
---
With how prominent the Honey Haus is in Fasnacht, I'd have loved for a bee launcher.
---
Or just a 'hive' mod for the flamer or cryo. Replacing their usual damage type with Piercing (Ballistic) and Radiation damage. Obviously with a bee spray visual. 
---
Fucking Bethesda. They are too slow to do anything. The fact that they had fallout 4 bugs in 76 proves it. They are like the sloths from Zootopia
---
Honestly, im not mad at them for doing what they did but they should work on fixing the duping glitches and getting those weapons out of circulation before they let people swap weapons and gear over. Other than that im perfectly happy with the game.
---
He's clearly lying. Trolling, actually, in a weird way
---
Wow, that's crazy. I hate power armor (and being overencumbered) so 90% of the time I'm trying to stay below 260 lbs.
---
Oh, I didn't know that.
---
The evidence we have points to it being like 2 people, not a few hundred.
---
I'm all for eliminating PVP in adventure mode completely
---
They already got rid of all stacks of rare weapons. What more can they do? 
---
Challenges might encourage you to have a team.  I just thought of that in a fraction of a second, I wonder what bethesda has been thinking of.  Oh well, WAIT AND SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
References the final battle to end the Scorchbeast Queen for good and seal up the fissures (we will never get there, but she doesnt know that.), just like the BoS was trying to do. She has seen hive Queen after hive queen killed, but they always come back. There has to be a coming time where the Scorchbeasts are wiped off the earth for good.
---
Take it out of your stash box
---
This mechanic is already in the game, take the workshop, build the extractors and power them but don't lock them, anyone can then take from the extractors. 
---
If you don't want participate in the pvp you can leave the server once you are done. 
---
They can't. OP is trolling
---
They said it might change because how upset the community was and yet it didn‚Äôt 
---
Riiiiight, we got lives (I fake that I do) üòé
---
Flayed?  Boltons catch you in Winterfell?
---
I have the materials with me 
---
I was all like, "Flayed? Dont you mean (looks at picture) decapi...oh! Nope. You're right" 
---
The idea is that loot would only be in one of the modes, survival being with empty stash, and untransferable between modes. Hopefully that is how the survival mode will be.
---
Now you're likely gonna have to pay for those bomb ass power armour skins though. ):
---
So, let me ask you this as a completely honest question... I do want to understand where you are coming from. 
---
Do you own a TSE or God roll bloody weapon? I'll be the answer is yes. I consider myself to be a fairly casual player, albeit with a lot of time in game, and I'm around level 150. Even I have a TSE. Two different types in fact. My armor isn't God level, but it's good enough to take on 3 SB at once and win. 
---
Now to the crux: how can a newish player possibly compete and against that? 
---
I prefer to think It was Kibo. 
---
I am pretty sure they will appear in the atom store in the next few days. üòÇ
---
I remember then ARK did something like this. Yes people got mad they have to redo a character but they got over it.
---
I‚Äôd still have to pop those things.
---
After 50 you choose between moving special or getting new perk. Pretty sure there is no level limit. But beware, as someone trying to rework my build, it is very slow going. You might consider new character for experimenting.
---
I think you SHOULD have to start a new character considering the it's a NEW game mode. I don't see why people want survival to be easy. It's supposed a challenge from the start. 
---
I disagree entirely, but who cares. Not like I'll be playing anymore anyways.
---
Im not that into stuff like this but im sure theres a way to check how many of one weapon there is out in the servers at any given time. Also they can work on fixing the duping glitch so that way if they cant get them off the servers they can make sure there arent any more of those exact same duped weapons being duped.
---
It's based on how many balloons survive the event. 
---
You get a pack every five levels.
---
Why can‚Äôt you get over it and move on, for the people who like playing it they are tired of hearing the same thing over and over again by the likes of you 
---
Im located well above the Top of The world, and the Kill Laugh Love sign is in the Atom shop for 600 i belive.
---
I agree. I‚Äôm up to listen to people just some people are outraged by this. I‚Äôm upset people are complaining. Imagine you don‚Äôt have much time to play the game and you finally went through all the campaign and hit level 50 and now you being forced to grind away all over again just to be able to use cool new weapons in a new mode
---
as for "good loot" - probably the best I've seen from locked containers is the random plan.
---
Most of the time it's a couple bits of ammo, pre-war money, a chem or two, and a weapon/armor to scrap for junk.
---
;;
---
Is it worth taking in a *permanent* build?  No - you only 'need' the lockpicking when you find a lock to pick, the rest of the time they are up to 3 points of cards you could use for something else in your build.  Make use of swapping cards around when you need to.
---
Let‚Äôs be real. All I keep seeing is variations of ‚Äúit will be a couple weeks before people have god builds again‚Äù, and I don‚Äôt feel that is true. In over 200 hours I have not seen one god roll item. And with current mechanics, farming legendaries was nerfed. So it will be fair a lot longer then most people think. Almost everyone that has god tier items bought them from a duper, I would bet money that there are not many that were found via rng, and even less that found a full set up. What everyone that doesn‚Äôt want a fresh start wants is an easy way to the top. 
---
Up-voted for reasonable constructive criticism made to improve the game
---
Yeah I know you‚Äôre not trying to sound like a dick. It‚Äôs true that the items don‚Äôt take much to build. Perhaps they could make static items that can be built which are unique to each workshop, take a shitload of materials, and once completed provide a bonus to the entire server like Feed the People used to. 
---
I might also add they said the changes to CAMP arnt coming until a future update 
---
Duping is over, but a whole lot of the duped items are still on the players.
---
The excuse is totally valid, only by creating a new server where only new chars can start, we get a server where duping is over.
---
i didnt mean workshops. i meant all those "potholes" in the gorund., like out in the woods, or in a field or in mioddle of a broken road.  
---
i wanted to be like a free-lance builder and just builkd extractors on each and every hole i find then supply power then leave,  
---
kinda like a mysterious stranger doing kind things but nobody knows who built them.
---
Sorry I meant to tag it as a Suggestion. Whoops
---
It's supposed to be PVP with no restrictions. Not an entirely new game. 
---
There's no way in hell I'm playing survive al when my crazy ass expensive (and out on the open) CANP can be destroyed by any asshole. 
---
I'll try to explain at a high level how lots of other games do it, but I'm sure someone has done it better. 
---
In a season model, every few months there is a new "season" and new characters can be made that are separate from the current characters you can play. These new characters are brand new, on a completely different segment of servers and characters, and only play with each during the duration of the season. 
---
At the end of the season and at the start of the new season, these characters are retired into the "normal" pool of characters and can be played forever with everyone else. They don't go away and they aren't deleted.

The end of one seasons starts the next one with the same situation. New characters can be made in their own pool of new characters. Sometimes there is a unique reward you start with for your accomplishments in the last season, or there are new tweaks to the game play that make playing fresh again exciting (like a new game mode). Other times it is the culmination of changes made during the season that makes it appealing to try playing the game all over again or doing a new character build. 
---
The seasons are typically 3 months, 6 months, or even longer. They provide a totally optional way for existing players to restart with friends or other new players, or compete with each other to do things better than they did last season. It is also a really natural way for new players to start on a level playing field in terms of character progression, but encourage them to start to learn the game in the middle of a season to prepare for the next if that interests them. 
---
If done well, Seasons are really cool and are totally optional. Some folks even start a new season for the first few week or month experience, then jump back to their normal characters. They are a win-win for all player types!
---
I'm from the other perspective, but I still agree with you... but for different reasons. 
---
I prefer PvE, so I'll be considering Adventure mode my "home"... but I will absolutely be going into Survival mode, and I'm super stoked that I can do it with my current main and that I can bring the spoils back with me to Adventure.
---
I'll be going to Survival when I'm feeling like playing something more challenging... or maybe I'm going over to spend some time with friends that prefer PvP... sometimes I may go there to learn more tactics or practice PvP... and other times there might be some gear that's only available in Survival.
---
I don't want to make that choice permanent. I see no reason to make it permanent. People are worried about a "level playing field"... not an issue... the playing field is never truly level for very long. They're worried about OP gear... or farming mats in Adventure mode... OP gear will exist regardless, and farming mats??? Really?
---
The ability to move between worlds worked just fine in Ultima Online... did we forget? (Oh wait... many of you never played UO... sorry.)
---
No, only cost of materials 
---
No you‚Äôre assuming.  You don‚Äôt have any facts and you‚Äôre having a fit on reddit because you‚Äôve been denied something.
---
Entitled 
---
You're right, it is anecdotal, but I'm not even the one making the claim. Can you produce evidence that Bethesda had planned for the game to be this particular brand of survival mode from day one?  
---
I tried a little better higher up in the thread! 
---
aaah you've made me discover this guy (may i use that term?), thanks!
---
I've done it 5 times. All 5 robots survived each time. I got the Giant, Soldier, Witch, no mask dropped, Soldier #2. 
---
If they made Survival mode a fresh start, I might reinstall Fallout 76. Think about that.
---
I am sorry my legitimate complaint bothers you so much. Your problem is many other people have also complained?  So, the product Bethesda made is bad, but you are angry people are complaining? 
---
Oh no, with that attitude they're going to get away with making another game we like. We must stop them before we have too much fun!
---
It‚Äôs a new gametype, meaning different coding, different rules to put it simply. 
---
No this would make starting a new character(where everyone starts out fresh and re-earn their items) pointless when they can bring over their already OP character. Just start over you‚Äôll be fine. Hell its a fresh start meaning most people‚Äôs builds can adjust to the new rules better. 
---
I have been gaming longer than most of the players on here have been alive. 76 is the worst of all Fallouts. If we remain silent then we only screw the community. Wake up children! This may yet be a good game but my trust in Bethesda has fallen. I will never trust them to release a good game again.
---
For sure, and I think it would be smart to do type of optional season system for new players every so often. I tried to explain it here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3sidh/bethesda_please_do_not_allow_the_transfer_of/ej2w10y/
---
I totally get the logic and concern, but I think it is worth trying at least! 
---
What if those Top 3 Players had squads of Bodyguards that were also in say the Top 20 and each Top 3 was a different faction? 
---
I could throw darts at this idea for a few hours!
---
I can 100% support this. Every player should either have to create a new character for survival mode, or maybe survival mode should be locked until level 100 and/or you complete the main story questline.   
---
It's one thing to be late to the party (aka, a new player finally getting the game on Christmas 2019), but it creates an unfair advantage to let level 200s jump in and take over the new game mode on day 1.
---
Who is afraid of pvp? It isn't me. 
---
Whatever gets rid of PVP-only people from Adventure mode permanently I'm all for.   I'd really like to see all the duped TSE garbage griefers move over to PVP and have them nuke/one shot each other every 3 seconds.  What I don't want is people who can't cut the PVP mode insanity coming back with an axe to grind on everyone in Adventure mode.  Make it a one way trip?  Just put all the events PVP so there is no reason to come back for any reason whatsoever. 
---
THEN... make Adventure mode a no-PVP zone. No damage whatsoever to individuals or structures except defense items (turrets, etc.).  
---
I agree with the others on a theoretical standpoint, but you on a practical one. 
---
I'm a fulltime student, and work fulltime as well. I don't have a ton of time in between class, assignments, work, and social relationships.  
---
I plan on going to pvp because I enjoy it (when willing) but not if I have to start from stratch. Limiting people will probably just lead to more raiding in the non-pvp servers not less.
---
Isnt that part of the problem though? Its not truly survival mode if I can hop into adventure mode for the grind, and beef up my character, and then jump back into Survival mode for PvP whenever I feel like it. It will create an environment where going into survival mode isnt a good idea unless you are already beefed up.
---
I doubt they'll cater to the posts here by next Tuesday. It sounds like you'll be able to use the same character across the board. We'll see how it plays out together
---
Camped where? 
---
Mind if i join next time. Im a melee build and i want to join things like this. Sounds like lots of fun!
---
I don't think that they are mad because they are rare.  They are upset because they probably won't ever even see one in the game.  Personally I am pretty much over it.  The event was fun and I hope that they do more of these types of things, but more challenging.
---
I grinded and have done it like 40-50 times, gotten pretty much all of the CAMP plans, common masks, and traded someone for a beret.  No recipes, but probably wouldn't ever make the food anyway.  
---
I'm really not that familiar with the scaling math in this game, but my understanding is that it is very different from other fallout games. Is that ill informed?
---
Do you have the quests active? Cause then I‚Äôm not sure. Maybe relog 
---
Tldr: I love this game but the hate of this game is multi-pronged, it's just the bugs and glitches get the focus because "reviewers" are lazy. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I love this game, but the hate of this comes from a few angles. The creators of the slogan "save single player" embracing online, the players that hate multiplayer games, the fact that it might be impossible to have a deep story with true choices that have substantial consequences in an online game, the breaking of lore. Now I have a conspiracy theory about the state of game journalism, including YouTube "reviews" that I will not bore you with except to say that they are lazy. They see the hate and feel emboldened but all they can be bothered with is reporting the bugs. Even this is a joke because all they did was put out clips collated from OTHER players along with their limited footage and talk over it. 
---
I'd be happy with event weapon skins for rewrds.
---
Ha! It‚Äôs soo obvious now. We just need to get everyone in agreement to not pop any balloons.
---
lol 1% chance is entitled? Interesting.
---
Your first words to my post were, "Good riddance." 
---
My point was that we should not recommend Fallout76 or other future Bethesda products until Bethesda does a much better job.    
---
Why would you be opposed to that?  You want Bethesda to only do the bare minimum?
---
Guns and plans, yep.
---
15th minute every hour
---
1* always drops at least 1*.
---
2* always drops at least 2*.
---
3* has improved chance to drop 3*
---
4* has small chance to drop 4*
---
5* always drops at least 3* can drop up to 5.
---
that'd get me over in a hurry. Even if I had to deal with grifers semi regulalry.
---
I actually crash quite a bit too, not as much as the early days, but it still happens.

If they can just fix it so when I‚Äôm setting the price for something and the buyer either requests another item or buys one it jumps to that and gets all messed up. Real annoying when your trying to sell multiple items and you have to try to set the price two or three times because the buyer doesn‚Äôt have patience for you to price all the items before buying.
---
Not everyone got those illegitimately, like say you paid 8,000 caps for one. You're just punishing innocent people. The dupers banned yeah absolutely, but its not right to purge items from others accounts because someone earlier did a bad thing. 
---
K, what job you applying for
---
literally finished the day before the patch was so glad to have that out of my daily rutine.
---
Toilets outside? Come on man, it is 2102!
---
True but that won't happen and we all know it. 
---
Because people still think they are getting insta-gibbed with slap damage without realizing it is actually because they did something else to allow themselves to become a PVP target and Bethesda is playing damage control for reasons...
---
Why would it? It only affects the materials costs, as per the text on the card. 
---
Well shit we're screwed then
---
Oooh that's a good idea ! It would need a workshop overhaul though to avoid some guy claiming the workshop and cancelling all that... But the unique items per workshop is really interesting :3
---
Right. They did that already. Anyone with multiple of the same gun was taken down to 1 of each because they couldn't determine who duped and who didnt 
---
I too am worried about the population levels

---
I think you would get more reinforcements from the Enclave since you have those missions where you basically take over some robots?
---
I think the "season" concept lots of people are posting can help with this, if it is done right an optional. I think the idea is that doing separate characters now allows for a unique game play experience that isn't possible in the current design, and I find really interesting. 
---
I agree with you that there will be some convergence at some point in terms of progression, and I am still optimistic that there is a good solution (be it seasons or something else) that makes giving this a shot possible. 
---
To be clear, I'm for a solution that lets old characters play the new mode as it is currently designed, but then to also had an option for new characters to play fresh only together and be locked in to survival mode (maybe forever, maybe for a "season"). I want everybody to enjoy the new mode!

I tried to explain some of it here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3sidh/bethesda_please_do_not_allow_the_transfer_of/ej2w10y/

Can't we build a Chessboard out of foundation pieces? Use Players as Pieces?

---
&gt;how can a newish player possibly compete and against that? 
---
By obtaining them the same way as all of us did - Just grind in Adventure mode until you have all the fun goodies you want, then join Survival.
---
Another problem with the reset is that it's a band-aid approach *at best*. If people want to "reset" for Survival just because they don't have all the stuff they want, should we "reset" every two weeks or so just to make sure that everything is "fair" for newer players? 
---
That's the only way to keep this going, after about two weeks new players will be in the same predicament as they are now, the only difference is that players like me are fucked and have to start all over.
---
Perhaps if you were mature you'd agree that sub-par products are bad.  But, whatever.
---
It‚Äôs time for this, reddit is NOT the decision maker for them.
---
I would like them to make a good game and they have achieved that.  I‚Äôve seen and played many games that are significantly worse than this so I wouldn‚Äôt call it the bare minimum.  I hope that their future works can build off what they learn from this though so they won‚Äôt experience as bad of an initial release.  And I wouldn‚Äôt say that saying good riddance is trolling.  If you mean to leave Bethesda and Fallout games for good, I wish you a good farewell and hope that you find a game that you do like
---
Wait...
---
If I have to start over on this game just because a new game mode came out I might as well just rebuy the game and throw away all the hours I spent working on my character. You can‚Äôt get even serums in survival mode it‚Äôs going to suck without player mode transfer
---
Do you mean like people twinking? I thought you couldn‚Äôt wear higher level gear than your current level.
---
Brewer
---
Do you understand that I can care less what you believe? It's true either way, more for me and anyone else who decides to check it out, the only people who lose are people like you.
---
You need to make less assumptions.
---
I think it‚Äôd be reasonable to keep those players in the same server until they leave. If that‚Äôs a possibility I think it‚Äôs fair. How many people are going to bother grinding that many levels to get the advantage over lower levels?
---
lol me too and I won't stop but I mean....its annoying as fuck
---
I'm all for more outfit variety. Filthy, torn lingerie, clean lingerie, speedos... I already see people duke it out in mascot costumes. It's not entirely unreasonable by comparison.
---
r/titlegore
---
Ok I'll try and supply you some I'm getting on now
---
Gt m9ner the king9
---
100% right. The map is so big and with so few people and no map markers for players you probably wont run in to many people. Only in high traffic areas will you probably run in to people and whos to say they will kill you? 
---
Shoot me I kill you. Legandary or not.
---
Starting at level 50 there are no new perk cards to unlock. That is to say that every time you level up you can pick from any card that exists in the deck. You will still have the option to either choose a new perk card or move a point from one SPECIAL to another SPECIAL every time you level up and every 5 levels you'll get a perk pack which will give you another 5 cards. 
---
Not sure if this has been asked...what if we let some robots die? Could this ‚Äúunlock‚Äù other masks? Just a thought 
---
Thanks. I believe I have seen this mentioned before, but with the split decision here on survival mode I figured it should be brought up again before they make another bad decision. 
---
I certainly do love this game and I don‚Äôt care much about the negative feedback which I can understand. It‚Äôs fun to play and I personally love the state of West Virginia and love what they did with it in this game. 
---
Ok, thats good and all, but they didnt patch the glitch and that just makes it so that all of those guns that got deleted just reappeared the next day. Also they took people down to a bit less than 1 since im over here missing my pipe rifle and boxing glove and my friend is missing a plethora of weapons and all of his armor that we got together so he was kinda told to start over since he didnt have anything other than a stalker's combat knife i gave him and his ushanka.
---
&gt;It will create an environment where going into survival mode isnt a good idea unless you are already beefed up.
---
How will that be any different in two to three weeks after Survival comes out?
---
Sure, everybody will be the same and it'll be "fair" at first, but give it a couple weeks and you'll have ungodly leveled players *anyhow*.
---
The only way to sustain this "fairness" of wiping everyone's slate clean for Survival is if they continually wiped everybody's slate every few weeks or so.
---
At best, a reset is a broken band-aid of a fix that does nothing but delay the inevitable, and it just fucks players like me over who don't have the time to start all over again.
---
I don't know what level of level of log they keep in their database. If they journalize (which is not so easy and ask more storage) they could see if a player get a lot of a specific items (and a mask can't be created ) in a short period of time.
---
Thanks for the reply (I‚Äôm PS4). I haven‚Äôt had much luck getting anything cool from defeating legendary enemies - most of the time the drops are crap gear. I‚Äôll keep grinding, as long as I‚Äôm still having fun. 
---
This actually would be the perfect compromise 
---
You would probably be waiting for a long time.
---
They did patch the glitch. A new glitch was found.
---
That actually would be a great idea, for the survival beta for exemple we could use them to give them in game feedback by a survey (?) for exemple and also use them when, for exemple, if vault raid are released we could use them to say if they're too easy or don't give enough reward
---
Same because, well, helvetica.

I really feel like I should see a Porta potty somewhere here. I love it!

---
I want my Voltron color setup from FO4 here so I'd buy black, red, green, blue, and yellow at a minimum.
---
Either come back when not drunk, or when you can use spell check. Its usually baked into your web browser...
---
Wrong, hacks were never really the primary way people got into the dev room at all, it was always possible with the base game, across all platforms due to a glitch and the location of the room, and still is to a certain extent possible (you just get your account suspended automatically now, apparently).
---
Tired of people thinking the dev room was a PC only thing or involved solely some kind of third-party program.
---
At least  the dude tried... lmao
---
Depending on legendary mob spawn rates.
---
Figured 4&amp;5 star are only gonna be raid bosses. 
---
I also have to imagine theyll add new perks/affixes around the  same time as legendary vendor or the raids. which means more junkies/exterminators type junk legendaries clogging up farming. 
---
Survival mode is going to be so bullshit.
---
Same here. All my characters have pacifist mode turned on just so I don't accidently hit somebody else. 
---
Fasnatch lol
---
Bethesda's community managers were misinterpreting / rephrasing what the dev said and also giving their own ideas. It would have been nice to have a stream with the actual devs in Austin, instead of community managers talking to a dev on the phone.
---
Initial details said that it was 1 hour from when it started, did that change?
---
I have all the common masks now. What's my incentive to farm the event now if I'm only going to realistically get dupes? This is a pretty bad design, to be honest.
---
Pictures or it never happened.
---
As long as players actually die when they get shot repeatedly then it wont be too bad
---
This would be a good compromise. Most players probably can't afford to level and play multiple characters.  Having a hardcore exclusive character set while still allowing normal players to experience each mode, keeps everyone happy.
---
Agree with everything besides the thing about fast travel, I like what they are doing with that. Would be nice to be able to make a new character, but won't be a good time with old characters too. Hopefully they listen.
---
You think it is a good game, but you admitted that you rarely see the bugs.  That's good for you.  What about all the other people who are experiencing bugs quite often?   Fuck them cause it's OK for you?    
---
In my post, where did I say I was leaving?  What was my original post about?  Key word: "Recommending".

Prove that what I state doesn't occur. You don't have the attention span for it. I'm the only person getting trolled by lazy kids who want a video...
---
lol i was on at 3:45 am last night the entire showed up to fight the queen we took her down but it felt like FOREVER..there were  a lot of melee fighters
---
Any time somebody else is at a vendor I want to use I sit on a bench to patiently wait for them to finish. It would be nice to be able to use my pipboy during that time.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
bless his heart..
---
Leveling up your character increases budget - how much is the question... 
---
What a bunch of entitled pussies getting upset that their little masks arent dropping. 
---
Get over it boys. It's a li.ited time event. In not UNACCEPTABLE.  They don't owe you anything. Get over yourself. They can make shit as rare as they bloody want, it's their game. Stop acting like it's yours. Its also everyone's.
---
They made ultra rare drop rates so that if millions of people grind one little parade all fucking day all  fucking week the community wont just be swimming in all the masks after 24 hours. 
---
Look how obsessed everyone gets about every new addition  and detail in the game. I guarantee you thousands of sweaty dudes haven't stopped grinding this event since it began. 
---
Just take a step back and realise what you are sitting around compiling data on. The masks will drop eventually. Or maybe they won't. Maybe only one or two will drop and be that much more rare. 
---
Point is , relax, focus on something else. Maybe your loved ones. 
---
It's really unbecoming when you get all salty and say 'this is UNACCEPTABLE.  Your Karen haircut really shows. Honestly every time someone tags s community manager in a post I just picture then asking to speak to the manager. 
---
You're the troll and a lazy one at that.
---
I'm definitly at that point where I'm trying figure out if you're just trolling.  If you are, I got mad respect for how well crafted that reply was and I'm going to sing its praises below.  If you're not trolling, then I guess the following is an explanation as why I'm confused.  
---
That first sentence can be summed up as "attrition by attrition" which doesnt makes sense but it makes me almost think i know what you mean.  Maybe sentence 2 will clarify. Nope. It does however have a nice poetic thing happening of just saying the  inverse of the first sentence. The kicker is that I cant actually tell who you're referring to when you say "they".  I read it from the perspective of both the griefer and the victim and both make just as much sense as the other.  
---
The thing that convinces me that you're trolling, is that you've been nice and respectful in your comments and that's rare for reddit, speaking as someone who puts himself in the asshole catagorie.   Best of luck to you.
---
Give the option of Transferring there character to survival-mode permanently or starting a new character. 
---
Back and forth is not surviving if you go back to an easier environment to rebuild supplies...
---
The problem is they should have done this from the start. Especially for the survival beta, once players are allowed to bring, or not bring gear from one mode to the next it is done. They can‚Äôt really change it. 
---
I bought a TV....
---
I'm a broke joke and don't think it'll get any better, let alone buy a monitor.
---
It's more they made it seem like the masks were all obtainable to some reasonable degree of success if you grinded a decent amount. Now that I know that less than 1% of people will even see one I'm done with the event. I've done it over 30 times and haven't even SEEN one of the 5 masks.I refuse to grind this missions 1k times (not even possible). It's not THAT fun for a mask I won't even use after the event closes.

I think they missed a chance to have an awesome event with fairly easy to get rewards that would make the community feel good. Instead 5/10 rewards are basically non existant.

I, too, have been playing computer games since computer games existed.  Bethesda has no excuse for such a miserable launch and subsequent bare-minimum support.

Don't complain about mother Bethesda, though.  The fanboys will down-vote you without comprehension.

Can it have something to do with how much your Charisma and Luck are?

Thanks, you won't be disappointed.

So it's only on PS4 then? Nobody on PC apparently has one of those mask. Something seems suspect.

You need Lockpick 3 and Hacker 3 to bypass the reactor section and get a couple doors open for mainframe cores if you want them. Hacker 3 allows you to turn off turrets if you cant handle them.

I‚Äôve personally had a lot of fun with fallout 76 and haven‚Äôt experienced many bugs, but if you‚Äôve had a bad time playing then that is your opinion. And I think we should all respect each other‚Äôs opinions.
