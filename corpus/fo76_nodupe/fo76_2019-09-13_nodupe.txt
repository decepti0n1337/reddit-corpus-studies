I’m level 260 and I’ve never had this happen once. Frankly, I’m probably the annoying one since I go out of my way to give them stimpack diffusers for the medic challenge anytime I happen to have a super stimpack.
---

---
Besides, they’ll be pulling their weight soon enough with one wasteland.
---
---
---
I'm also curious where this "10 year" quote came from.
---
Everything you place in it is floating off the ground. That's not proper functionality, unless communism gives you Cris Angel powers. Drives me insane swing everything literally floating in hat bunker. It needs to be fixed.
---
Higher stash space means people stashing more unique items that have to be tracked separately eg weapons, armor, degradable foods etc which all have separate conditions.  The infinite junk stash makes no difference because 1 steel and 10 million steel require the same effort to track.
---
Aww thank you so much! My ps handle is d-bunny84
---
I literally said I have not been playing dumbass.
---
That might be a FO1st special? It's hard to tell bc they don't separate 1st from regular stuff but if your friend has it and 1st, and you don't see it and don't have 1st, then that would explain it.
---
diluting the pool? Everybody wants bear arm recipe, as a melee main I find those recipes hella desirable for the chance at legendary rolls (I'm 2-handed so finding tenderizer and sheepsquatch staff plans were a dream)
---
Good thing is they want it to last a long time atleast ten years
---
Sometimes they float, sometimes they don't. And a rug can make it unnoticeable. If you adjust lighting, you won't see it. 
---
It should be improved, but the game has bigger problems.
---
That would be great thank you! My ps handle is d-bunny84
---
Check out Chernobyl.  Radiation isn’t necessarily a dead zone
---
I am become death is a repeatable quest, it'll start automatically when you go down the silo elevator
---
It was a qoute saying atleast ten years
---
TS ultracite gatling laser
---
Then why do you care
---
I really hope not, I don't wanna buy fallout 1st and then buy the bundle, thatll cost me a bit.
---
Don't use logic when it comes to Bethesda. Human beings wouldn't be able to walk those lands for hundreds of years. Yet, we can farm. Which would never be possible again.
---
I know, but every other place in fallout is a dead zone. Why not here?
---
Brahmins produce fertilizer, have two heads, 4 stomachs, 2 buttholes, so that leaves one to deduce projectile diarrhea, dear watson.
---
Then they should work on those bigger problems before releasing more bugged content. And they always float, I've never seen them not floating in my bunker. No matter where I place it. And covering up an issue doesn't get rid of it lol
---
Try going to character editor
---
Well yeah, but with your subscription you get 1650 atoms so it's kind of a wash
---
I just would be ok with changeable light mods on it. Colors and brightness and maybe a vault boy one. That way it has use but doesnt take away from power armor
---
Answered on the first reply! :)
---
I stopped a couple weeks back after completing the season, I've been going pretty much daily since wastelanders and im done for a couple months its just burnout. I'll most likely be back in a month or two, I know tons of people say it but it is really nice taking a break and not having to worry about the new season.
---
I refunded mine the next day when I saw the shitty foundation and floating items inside it...
---
That was one nuclear meltdown.  We're talking about 30,000 nuclear weapons.
---
Well no. It doesn’t. Junk is literally just an item then quantity. But weapons and armor are all unique pieces (unless you have duped items, looking at those of you who were lucky enough to not get caught), so it has to record all its durability and that. I don’t see why everyone can’t have a stashbox.
---
Ahhh ok.  Thx for the answers =]
---
My Exc PA Carry weight: 360
---
My carry weight with a small chem backpack: 405, or something like that.
---
The should be no reason we LOSE carry weight when we put on a tank exoskeleton.
---
Antiarmor is always good. Always. Whatever your perks, your build, your weapon.
---
Um I’m not sure exactly which heavy weapons I have but the next time I hop on I’ll make a list for you
---
Since items in your stash don't need to be modeled in the visual space and are just a number. It should not matter if the number is 1 or 2E64-1. It seems more like a constraint to make us spend our time managing our character within the game. OK I can live with that. I run two accounts with 10 toons, so 8K total stash weight and I still run out of room. The scrap bin really helps but do I really need &gt;50K steel, &gt;10K Lead, and &gt;10K acid (my 50cals think I do).
---
But do we really need to be spending time managing sooooo many different currencies? In real life by now there would be a bank and currency exchange...are the vault dwellers and wastelanders really so stupid or lazy to not see the arbitrage opportunity? Does the cult of the mothman prohibit handling of money?
---
Leave the forest
---
That Gun is a tribute to that gun. Heh.
---
[deleted]
---
45=!10mm
---
Well that’s something. Still feel like I spent a lot less than 1650 bullion on my miner mask.
---
&gt;atleast ten years
---
I have no doubt they want it to last a long time but do you have a source for this?
---
Taking zero damage from anything is just serendipity.  You will take damage from things though.
---
How much does Class Freak reduce negative effects? Do I need empath and herd mentality if I'm on a Vampire build? I have every mutation except for these two.
---
Source?
---
True
---
At first I was thinking there was no way this would work due to the amount of the space issues, but then I realized this would basically work like another character since only 1 camp would load in with each player. 
---
So yes please
---
I've read of people who will jump servers untill the find a legendary that drops a weapon with their preferred prefix and then go to the purveyor.  I tried it once it was a lot of work and it didnt work for me the purveyor still gave me junk

Confirms - FO1st special offer
---
Awesome post!
---
Recently I've started using bloodied bashing damage minigun. I just tag Earl with 20 shots from the fixer for the beginning, then start sneaking around taking out wendigo spawn, letting everybody else to tag Earl.
---
If he wasn't taken down for 15 minutes, I just pull out the said above minigun and melt him.
---
The tag in the beginning to assure that I get my reward even when there's another magic gun owner in the group.
---
The Fallout series is fairly unrealistic in terms of nuclear weapons and what they actually do. So as to not write a huge post; basically what would really kill people and the environment after so many nukes were set off would be the nuclear winter that ensued. A nuclear bomb puts lots of debris into the atmosphere, after enough go off it puts enough debris into the atmosphere that the amount of sun getting through is not enough to sustain photosynthesis. Without photosynthesis the entire ecosystem collapses.
---
These limits need to be taken away.100%
---
I have two mules just for legendaries. it sucks and I usually wind up selling many cheap in my vendor just to get rid of the weight.
---
It took ALOT of CARD tossing to figure out what I needed to change. Im not using a build off reddit or anywhere,just one I through together. On PC or I would help you.
---
Nuclear fallout.
---
What about the savage divide and mire tho?
---
well, it would be possible to farm. but we would only be able to eat it once.
---
[removed]
---
Then, don't use it. I am 78% satisfied with it, and I use it. I get crazier about other similar things (like backpacks which float over your back or show no straps) and avoid those items. 
---
Wrapped cap? It shaves your face. Hooded rags? They remove all clothes and armor. Fast travel to a friend's camp? Get stuck into the foundation forever.
---
Sooooo true. I'm not even playing so I don't get legendaries guns and armor. My stash is full, I can't take a carrot that I instantly get overweight. Made my camp next mama so I can walk into her to trade my legendaries. I trade, turn off Fallout and just back the next day.
---
And there's a plus that I constantly fall from the servers during events. So, I don't know If the actual way is working.
---
Fallout is my fav game, but is getting impossible to have fun.
---
I did not know till a month later that I could block them.  Now I just cap one and stealth and wait for the cap. If I want to pvp, I will PUBG :)
---
How do I kill a boss?  Use a glitch!  Thanks a lot. /s
---
What, so wanting *basic* QoL from a triple A game makes me a spoilt brat? Wanting what was advertised from my Fallout 1st subscription when it was initially launched makes me spoilt? Wanting stable servers that don’t crash and make me disconnect six times a day makes me spoilt? If you say so.
---
Oh that biv I know that biv

It’s an [an exclusive for FO1st members](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6B24sQjpl8X7fWxQS6PjyF/atomic-shop-weekly-update-september-8-15).  
---
Hopefully it will return for everyone else soon. 
---
This might be a good time to pick up FO1st for one month. The Atoms alone would be worth it, and you can dump all your scrap into the Scrapbox and free up some Stashbox space.
---
The bundle is discounted 20% off, so it’s only 1440 Atoms. You’ll get 1650 Atoms with FO1st. So for $13 USD, you get the bundle you want and 210 extra Atoms.
---
Bingo. That did it. Got a b50%ld 15%vats or instig deathclaw gnt or junkies 50dr 50%old with your name on it if you're on ps4.
---
Everyone knows Biv. Everyone likes Biv. Biv's the reason I bought 76.
---
What about it? No nukes hit WV. There certainly is radiation but that doesn’t mean no plant life. And not everywhere in Appalachia is lush. Look at toxic valley and ash heap. Now the reasons they look the way they do has little to do with nukes but it still is a stark departure from the forest.
---
aaaahm..... empath gives a team damage buff!?!?!? is it not that the empath takes more damage and his teammates take less damage instead!?
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Empath](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Empath)
---
The other fallout games either take place in a desert or 200 years later. The radiation has had a chance to mess with the flora. 76 takes place like 25 years after the bombs fell.
---
If you know what cells are, then as long as you or someone else is in that cell, they stick around till server refresh.
---
Its a good question and I got downloaded for asking it lol. I hope it does it adds a whole new builds u can make in both modes
---
Bethesda: We'll add Legendary perks so players can do more damage etc.
---
Also Bethesda: *NERF EVERYTHING*
---
You need high perception, high luck and high agility. A lever action and an instigating or Bloodied western revolver. 
---
I ran such build for 200 levels. The Revolver was able to oneshoot most enemies. It was a beast.
---
$
---
And those should all be fixed, along with the bunker people paid for that just like so much else in this game, is buggy. If they add something in and it's buggy, it should be fixed. Whatever excuses you make for it won't change that. Regardless of something being worse, it all needs to be fixed. Period.
---
Could just be internet on your end for the game to randomly crash I had that issue for a year non stop on PC then I finally upgraded my router and I never had that issue after that. I would check that first. Now if you where playing fine then it to just start crashing maybe it is the game not sure it depends on which platform you play on as well.
---
Update hits on Sept 15. Up to you if you want to check it out.
---
Wow that’s awesome!!! Knowing how clumsy I am I will end up falling off haha.i love it
---
Its been like this since I started playing lol. Welcome to the club
---
You can't transfer console data to pc, same for pc to console
---
!👍!
---
Ok I’ll have to check out the update notes thanks
---
It is ironic, but I like the balance. It makes it more about the quality of a build and character overall instead of some random gun
---
Didn't expect to find you here man!
---
I watched every single one of your video and really appreciate your fantastic job
---
Keep up with the good work
---
Unlimited grinding is one of the main things in a rpg/mmo.i do not understand why they would limit players.makes no sense to me.i play other games not just this game.so when i log in,i want to be able to play however i want for as long as i want.
---
Bugged for a year maybe.
---
You should have the ability to make multiple camps in private at least I do like this idea too though
---
I've always seen that since beta days. It's gotten better but I'll walk anywhere with robots and sometimes the just drop dead it's kind of funny with how random it is on my end but I think that is a server issue on Bethesdas side.
---
He’s had a different voice actor for over a year.
---
hey. thanks for watching my videos
---
Yeah so as it turns out, this isn't that server intensive. How do all the other mmos with not much more sophisticated servers do it then?
---
Yeah the first couple weeks I had fallout 1st was around April 2020 and I remember I could place my tent almost anywhere I wanted ... now I have to run a goddamn triathlon every time I place it down ..
---
I like this idea. I was wanting something similar and was thinking we could get another friendly Moleminer NPC who was a Surveyor or something and we could buy or unlock slots, like 2 or 3 or something and pay this guy caps and supply the required materials to rebuild a saved CAMP exactly how you mentioned.
---
It is fallout 1st
---
The bane of me starting up a session lol.
---
In order of usefulness:
---
1. Star: Bloodied/Junkies/AntiArmor/Furious
---
2. Star: Explosive/ Aiming/ Fire Rate OR VATS Crit DMG / Vats Hit Chance
---
3. Star: Lightweight OR Crit Fill / Reload or AP cost / SPECIAL stat (end or str)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
2. Star has Bashing as magic, making it good NOW (until it wont when (if) it is fixed)
---
I've had the new work bench, but didn't everyone get that?
---
My main character is over level 400, so most of the items i am looking for are rare and if a vendor has them they are likely selling them at high caps (and that is why they are still there). I run two accounts with 10 toons, all just below max caps (28-29K). If the vendor has more then one plan I am looking for it is very likely they will lose caps to the void.
---
I know what would solve this problem. Make it so we can "scrap" legendaries for legendary modules. 
---
1 Star 33% chance for a module.
---
2 Star 66% chance for a module.
---
3 Star 100% chance for a module.
---
That way its not always guaranteed, and at least you can craft more of the items you can't trade others anyway so it won't ruin the games "economy".
---
Do you believe it’s possible that this will get fixed come this Tuesday with Update 22? I’ve been reading that PTS that they are no longer allowing ammo factories and you can’t place your camp if you have one. Maybe this Tuesday the update will register the phantom ammo factory camp space.
---
I didn't know this, I assumed everyone was getting the free stuff.
---
Need that modded 4k texture pack tho pls
---
But they are. I do it all the time.
---
Ohhhh my god don’t torture me like that.  Hands down favorite weapon from any of my Fallout experiences.  I remember chopping through Deathclaws and Assualtrons on survival mode with one magazine.
---
I mean, I didn't buy it, so....
---
Might as well just wait until the 15th. Leveling will be new for everyone then. One wasteland and all. It's going to be a completely different game. I've leveled 4 toons. I kinda think it won't be as fun after this. For first timers it's cool, but for alts it might be kinda tedious. We'll see I suppose. Either way, if you start a strategy now, it will surely have to change soon. Other than that. Take workshops and do all the forest/ t valley events you can. That xp is way better than just killing.
---
Nerf the guns by all means, but for the love of Atom, dont fuck with the builds. 
---
Nerfing Bloodied, Junkies, Sentinal Et al is just taking the piss.
---
Herd Mentality absolutely *is* activated when on a solo Public Team.  I just tested it myself. Not only did my displayed SPECIALs increase, so did the associated functions. Carry weight went up, HP went up, Barter value went up.
---
Bethesda said that when the game launched not sure if this is still the plan though
---
I think 76 is in a better place now than last year or even since release. Today, though, is roughly the same as two months ago, give or take an update or two. Play feels the same overall, though.
---
Tuesday supposed to bring great changes. I'd say read the current inside the vault and the one prior on 03 Sep. Maybe watch some YouTube videos on it, Juicehead has some good vids about what's coming.
---
Either way, it's your call, but I'd say give it a chance after the update.
---
So a junkie bashing combat shotty is magic?
---
75%
---
I just want to be able to save perk profiles
---
Today I got a J2515 LMG so I'm not mad at Mole Momma. She's been moderately kind to me the past few days.
---
Yea but we all know they had it on the roadmap to look like the q4 dlc imo
---
25% reduction per rank, up to 75% at Rank 3. 
---
And to be honest, every build benefits from those two mutations. +2 to all stats and less damage, even when solo. 
---
Let me give you a rundown on my main’s mutations:
---
- Bird Bones
---
- Carnivore
---
- Eagle Eyes
---
- Egg Head
---
- Empath
---
- Grounded
---
- Healing Factor
---
- Herd Mentality
---
- Marsupial
---
- Scaly Skin
---
- Speed Demon
---
Stat boosts: STR +0, PER +4, END +2, CHA +2, INT +7, AGI +6, LUCK +2. A total of 23 extra stat points. 
---
Other Effects: +50 Damage Resistance, +150 Energy Resistance, Damage Reduction from Empath, +20 pounds carry weight, x2 Jump Height, Slow Fall, x2 benefit from meat-based foods, +25% Critical Damage, x4 Healing Speed, Maximized Movement Speed, even while sneaking, and Faster Reloading of Weapons. 
---
**Class Freak 3** means I get all those benefits for a trade off of: -12 HP, -12 AP, 13% less effectiveness from Chems &amp; Stims, -12% Energy Damage, and no benefits from plant-based foods.   The last two are irrelevant for me, since I don’t use energy weapons except very rarely and I keep plenty of meat-based food available. 
---
That’s an exceptional trade-off.
---
They had it where you had to go to the work bench to claim it. But then everyone cried about that because the owners built all around it so players couldn't get to it. It wasn't a problem when you could destroy walls but everyone cried about that too. So I guess if everyone cries about their hard day at the workshop they will just give everyone free resources when you walk up and push the button. All you need. No fighting or anything. Hell, they just might takes guns away because everyone cries if they die or get killed in this game. We can replace it all with poetry and hugs. Everything will be fr reeeeeeeeeeee!
---
I'm curious, does explosive have any effect on the gauss shotgun since it already has explosive damage?
---
It's not much but here's some support: Happy cake day!
---
You get the team damage buff with Empath only if team mates have empath too as far as I understand it. Correct me if Im wrong.
---
Pretty much, and a mumbles sale but almost no way to get scrip
---
&gt; I hope this is a long way off though.
---
well it will take a lot of time for them to decide to close servers but they will most likely drop support(updates and dlcs) earlier(1-3years from now)
---
But your approach kills the game. If nothing else is released until the game is 100% fixed, that's it. No new skins, no new items. No nothing. Servers are abandoned, game stops being profitable, the game dies. 
---
At this point, you should know it works that way. Half the things they release are buggy or broken in some way. 'It all needs to be fixed' you say. Sure. But it won't happen.
---
With Class Freak you reduce the amount of damage you take. And you also get the same benefit as your teammates do.  So it’s a net positive.
---
Ok then they shouldn't cap a workshop then. Simple.
---
Not to be rude but this question gets asked at least once a day and I don't get it. No internet strangers can tell you what you will or won't like. You already own it, so reinstall if you feel like it and re-uninstall if you feel like it.
---
Its all good lol, I mean to be fair I'm pretty much another negative rant that I know everyone gets tired of seeing
---
Right? They don't see the problem it would cause.
---
They just worded it wrong. They meant Team Damage RESISTANCE buff.
---
Yeah, heard mentality does, empath doesn't
---
Not empath
---
I pre ordered it and I’m level 70 on my first build which I’ve used since launch
---
It's a wasteland. Not everyone you meet will be all happy sunshine and rainbows. People want to be the bad guys in an MMO, they want to face other players. Especially in a setting where there is no law like Fallout's Post Apocalyptic setting.
---
lol
---
For the love of game design yes pay everybody in the system i support coders getting fair pay tho there is a huge gap and its rong tbh
---
Got to start a new playthrough. Kinda sucks but it's good to have extra accts
---
?????  
---
No it isn't I got 4 faster swing speeds today on the 2 star.   
---
On xbox.
---
I’d have to double check Empath, but I could swear I saw a vid by Angry Turtle where he tested it and confirmed.
---
Might be my imagination.
---
Theres a difference between the Browning M2 and the M1919. Like, a big difference. I'm aware the MG42 is in game, I was just saying we should get the M1919. Have it chambered in the 30-06 and it holds between 60 to 120 rounds depending on attachments and has a high rate of fire. With a Tripod attachment to make it more accurate and less jumpy when crouched (or prone if it was added)
---
So u like it or u want it to expand? Its the same thing sa if i said yea i like the smg weapons in game if there were more of them and were any usefull. The reasson i dont like it that they give u like freaking harpoon and pick axe. Like nobody play these sh.t and they do like its pinicle of gameplay and add it as a event meta reward. Like there are moments that i think Bethesda is just making a fun of us...
---
Not so good when on different systems.
---
I understood it that empath only gives you a debuff,so if no one else in the team has it,you only have  a penalty. 
---
If you have 4 people with empath,then you have +33+33+33-8.
---
You should [read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).
---
Rite no questions asked this is why I love this subredit
---
Well, bashing is classified as a "magic" perk, which NORMALLY activates for weapons at a firerate of 200, but since a shotgun shots "multiple times at once" (pellets) it triggers the same "magic" effect.
---
As of right now, Instigating, Junkies, and Vampire are magic Pre1 effects, Bashing is a Pre2 effect (also 33Vats hit and 50 limb dmg). Your shotty is magic by being a Junkie weapon alone.
---
Only time my inventory ever lags is my Aid tab when it's sorted by Spoilage.
---
And that's despite my Notes and Holo tabs having at least three times more things in it than the Aid tab.
---
sep  4 eech
---
Increase stash to 1,600 at least, increase scrip to 500, and gold bullion shouldn't even have a cap i don't think. Most of the time I end finding low lvls and dropping legendaries even 3* due to the fact that my stash and Vendors are full. It is a pain no doubt! I still have fun with this game though.
---
I'm level 337 and have been playing since July 2019... 😟
---
No, it DOES buff yourself if you're on a team as well.
---
So it's +33/+33/+33/+25 (33-8)
---
Upvoted for truth
---
Its a great idea, but almost impossible to execute. Some ground pieces fit certain places and not others etc. Maybe when we have access to indoor camps where the area is a designated area then it could be possible. But outdoors not so much.
---
Anyone got any plans for a Stimpak Diffuser
---
This is for PS4
---
Free karma. Everyone that loves the game but to lazy to comment justs upvotes.
---
You are wrong. There are tests showing that it affects yourself as well.
---
Yeah I once tried lone wolf+nerd rage + emergency protocol+ blocker and I was still taking damage from ghoul's melee.Enough damage to care for it. You cannot reach 100% resistance,or invincibility.
---
Because they aren't operating with an engine from the late 2000s designed for single player. 
---
Because they want people to play it constantly with all the time gates
---
Because they want more money from fallout first subscribers
---
Oh for sure, I completely agree but it's an excellent levelling perk and I find it situationally useful on a bloodied build as well since using diluted radaway to regain some useable health bar knocks me out of nerd rage and that seems to happen less often with it equipped.
---
**TL;DR**
---
**not extactly... it depends....**
---
460 Rowland &gt; 10mm by a wide margin, 45 super is right in par with the hottest 10mm. Both are 45 cal and chambered in 1911 handguns. Besides 40 S&amp;W is technically 10mm aswell, and thats nothing to wtite home about. So your argument is kinda of ehhhhh, subjective? It really depends on what bethesdas "45"  and "10mm" actually are. 
---
Irl ,10mm tends to be over exagerated and is nearly identical to 357. Which truthfully isnt very impressive. Honestley with the right bulket anything you can do with a 10mm you can do with a 45 acp +p. 10mm just gives you a flatter trajectory.
---
 Imho opinion type of bullet when talking about 10mm vs 45 acp is much more important than caliber in regards to "damage".  RNFP hard cast lead or even better a monolithic solid would be what id choose to wonder the wasteland with. Ball ammo or hallowpoints would be the last things in either caliber id want vs some of the baddies we face off with.
---
 As a real life  big bore shooter/enthusiasts, 10mm and 357 simply put, are all bark and no bite. Heavy "slow" bullets from mild to warmer 45 colt and 44 specials are sgnificantly more effective at putting game down. Now when you get to 44 mag or tier 3 45 colt thing get interesting', but it really gets serious when you step up to 454 casull or  480 ruger. 
---
Than again this is video game land, so whats my real life experience mean anyways.
---
I will add you on there! I just got fallout 1st so let’s go kill some super mutants - Username: Antnydoom
---
What bugs me about that is how plantlife, particularly the sundew species, evolved into trees. I’m a big fan of sundews irl, and this just irks me lol.
---
Not enough time passed for the scale of evolution!!!
---
Yeah with herbivore and tato salad and tato this tato that you get some nice ap regen. I picked up empath mut but was worried it wouldnt work unless other ppl in the team also had it?
---
LoL
---
This reddit page seems to have the answers https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iquhuj/nuke\_codes\_are\_now\_fixed\_get\_out\_there\_and\_launch/
---
I hope they add more mutations soon
---
Use the weapon artisan perk card to repair it to 200% condition.
---
YES. 100%
---
Uh you’re thinking of this all wrong. One violent night is a use up excess stims that have been weighing you down. Got to many radaway? nuke FSP and unburden yourself while standing in a fallout zone. 
---
And if you just have way too much ammo then run ACP! BGS has really thought things through
---
I’m on PS4 and would love to buy some off you.
---
Or at least something, maybe even mf cells. It’s a little silly to have one jet pack eat up a ridiculous amount of power to go ten feet up while the other can just do it for free.
---
Yeah ngl some of it’s a bit suss, but canonically most of the plants should die eventually.
---
Exactly.  Even with a vampire weapon, you still take damage, you just heal after
---
It has an effect, it "applies" the effect (both in dmg and degradiation of your weapon)  
---
It also works with demolition expert (and I heard it will be quite good in One Wasteland)
---
Ok well TIL. I only recently took it and havent fully been able to test it for myself. Good to know. Thank you
---
Armor piercing tungsten nails
---
Mine is SixteenXDetails! I'm on now if ya want!
---
So is being able to complete an event that a high lvl is helping with because don’t have to worry about being over encumbered by legendaries they can’t sell. Then that low lvl gets a legendary weapon (leveled to them),xp and plans that could help them.
---
Yeah, people in general aren't good with the whole poison v. venom thing. I think it's mainly people who work with animals that tend to know the difference.
---
I sure wouldn’t mind some headwear for the Mountain Scout outfit that I wear &amp; Love so much.
---
Edit:but please not another F’in beret,plz...
---
For the love of Whoever your chosen deity is.
---
TSE will have its comeback, and Anti-Armor will also be quite good (since it HAS to be multiplicative (50% of armor))  
---
Value wise, AAE, AA and Junkies are AS GOOD (in specific cases, maybe even better) than Bloodied.  
---
Also, Instigating could be a new go-to for Melee Weapons (since it also works multiplicative (2x))
---
That's pretty cool, so would demolitions expert apply both to the inbuilt explosive damage of the gauss as well as the legendary effect? If so that will most likely be rather good in one wasteland. although the extra degradation will annoy the life out of me hahaha
---
“Most likely” based on what?
---
I get it you want unlimited gambling.
---
I had two attacking me at the freak show and all I could do was spam the stimpak button and then run away. It was kind of ridiculous.
---
Whatever got you to stop playing is still the case today. The only difference is that Season 2 of the legendary run is coming along with Daily Ops and One Wasteland.
---
If those changes are enough, come back. If not, don't waste your time.
---
&gt; I just want to play in the same world as my friends, and jump easily 
---
Definition of wanting to have your cake and eat it.
---
Do you want to play on the same world as your friends OR jump servers easily. Pick only one.
---
Yeah its real stuoid. Either add in more storage mods for PA or add a buff thaf increases carrying capacity by 300
---
Ok so still filled with bugs I’ll probably just pass thanks mate
---
I just run a bar now so
---
You need to try a different forum, though unfortunately. Posts here have to be about FO76. 
---
Try r/PS4.
---
Best of luck.
---
Yeah the game lost its identity as an actual survival game.
---

The whole idea is that the camp would be redeployed at exactly the same location you built it, provided the space was free.
---
They’re only good for targets that don’t crouch. Little pussies who crouch break the berry Mentats.
---
Wait, so you're saying you're cool to PvP but you're not cool with HOW people PvP?
---
Seems a little rich, don't you think?
---
How about rather than come crying to the players to stop using teslas and actually push Bethesda to fix these weapons so that they don't cause all these lagging/crashing problems?
---
It's surprising how many people will blame players for issues that is entirely on Bethesda to resolve.
---
Only a level 20 dude
---
I’ll hook you up man. Add me. I think I have one.  I know I have a 50 cal and a mini.  The mini is magic. You can just have one of them.
---
Yep it’s still around. I use it when speedrunning 4. Works as of August
---
My ideal is that since the game was built on the Fallout 4 engine, that they simply reverted to a single player with the NPCs and quest lines intact. The more they could preserve the better. I really love this game.. I would hate to see it just disappear into the vapor.
---
There are at least [two more coming](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6B24sQjpl8X7fWxQS6PjyF/atomic-shop-weekly-update-september-8-15).

---
This needs to be stickied, or a bot needs to respond with this, thanks for that
---
No, I don’t want half of stash weight full of legendary weapons and armor waiting to be sold in my vendors or script. I’m carrying 8-10 heavy weapons that need to be scripted on my character because I have the bear arms perk. Plus another 4-10 in my stash/vendors that nobody buys because they have just as many as me. I don’t go to grandma until the machine tells me “do you really want to sell that for 0 script?” Because I’m maxed out on script.   I also remember when I was low lvl (2 months ago) and didn’t have a cap to my name.
---
Erm, You can have more than one friend, or more than one group of friends. Why pick one?
---
Get a better computer
---
This!! Blueprints can’t replicate hours of tedious and precise placement to get it looking exactly how you wanted it! Would love for this to be a feature
---
I had the same issue, just hopped servers put in the fuse and blood and skipped the terminal getting right in the machine. Worked for me
---
Think we are getting close to 1 year for mountain scout headwear. Probably not gonna fix it ever
---
Raiders wear it though
---
Ya I totally get that. But the only way that would possible if there were designated locations kind of like the workshops. There would have to be x amount of locations and at least 1 more than max server pop, then you would have to be sorted into servers where your location is not occupied. It just isn't going to happen. Unless its like I said before.
---
I guess they are thinking the interior spaces thing will push more item sales. 
---
Not that I've heard much more about that officially since seeing it on the road map.  I think it's planned with fractured steel update, so a bit far out for details maybe?
---
Either way I'm 100% behind this idea. 
---
I think fondly of past camps and would love to be able to get them back. I always get itchy feet, want to have a switch up.  Call me a turncoat but I can wave responder flag one day and raider the next. 
---
But I can't rebuild those camps. 
---
I can never build it the same.
---
I launched last night and the codes on nukacrypt work.
---
Stuff in mine floats. But i probably wouldnt of noticed til it was said. It's the door sound that gets me
---
Be fun to kill future nazis. Or the dads of nazis.
---
Umm... because of the other problem... server hopping easily... cause you can't have both...
---
And poison resistance. How in the hell a bug can bite you when you're inside a PA?
---
I ended up filtering all my stuff,from my main,to my mid,too my mule...then invited all the friends who’ve played &amp; helped me through my time a free grab at anything that interested em....

It’s been a pretty dope weekend,&amp; we’re just finishing day one.

Tomorrow can only be as good OR BETTER!!
---
But ye,Ol Mole Mammah ain’t blessed me wit ish I’m actually gonna be able to put into play sadly.
---
At least I can share the wealth though!
---
Request a refund. I bought that ice cooler box by accident, took about 3 working days to get my 500 atoms back, plus i still had the icebox at the end of the
---
Got my atoms back and free icebox
---
Noticed this alot in whitesprings. But also happens random raiders at crater especially inside. And raiders at my camp usually drop dead when I'm near
---
I agree. It’s in the ‘About’ section but often gets overlooked.
---
Yes it kinda reminded me of that
---
I only just started playing the game  month ago (level 38) and cant speak to the issues with scrips yet, but I'll be damned if CAMP budget and stash space arent so depressingly debilitating. I literally haven't been able to make a CAMP im happy with because everytime I try my budget is maxed before I even start displaying stuff.
---
I broke down and got Fallout 1st, but Im still running into massive storage issues. It would be night and day if they doubled CAMP budget and stash space even if it was only for 1st members
---
Really? I've never been chased by beggars in the past 15+ months of playing.
---
I'm on PC and I play often. 
---
I don't mind the big buffs. I don't know anyone in fame so I always played solo. But with the new team-finding system and bonuses, I never play as solo - I join a team even if not playing with them directly.  It put multi-player into the game for me.
---
Why is this a thread?
---
Its not nazi it imperial germany
---
Australia says hello from earlier in the year.
---
Imo the code will look at your base stats and legendary perks won't have any effect toward NW.
---
No plans &amp; as dralphaboomer said, only level 20.
---
Yes that place reminds me of the old skyrim cave it was kinda cool
---
Omg yes
---
It’s real cool dark and colorful glowing colorful
---
blueprints
---
Maybe my opinion is different because I’ve been playing since before the purveyor and find endless grinding of legendaries boring.
---
Unfortunately at work atm :( when are you usually on?
---
Legendary power armor exists but not legitimately.
---
Ya. This is the most frustrating part. Having a blueprint n u cant place it down. After placing it down. U sometimes cant move it
---
I wholeheartedly agree. I get annoyed everytime I break the leg. vendor and have a backpack full of gear left. At this point i just get on hit the scrip and gold limit and get right back off cause I can't accomplish anything substantial in one day. It's so frustrating. It's why I took a couple months off, started playing again three weeks ago and now I'm in the same annoyed state I was in when I stopped playing. The currency limits could easily be doubled.
---
Welcome to Australia’s January.
---
Maybe I'm not understanding you. Are you to explain why each are incompatible?
---
U believe what they say? Its all about money.

I think it'd be cool if in FO5 we find out we restarted the enclave and did alot of horrible horrible stuff. like make it canon that 76'ers were horrible people lol

I said exactly that in another post today, and a very helpful poster noted that the structures that you see in pictures of CAMP builds are often deceptively small (not the prefabs like the Seedy Shed or Log Cabin, of course, the ones you build yourself). He mentioned the size of his buildings and I was floored.
---
I went back to my CAMP and cut down on the amount of empty floor space and it made a world of difference. I didn't have to get rid of any furniture or decorations, either. For reference, this is my CAMP. I have a decent amount of free space as well.

---
I got a junkies/40as/+E    moleminer gauntlet. Good enough.
---
I would love this a lot, but I really would prefer they also fix the issue where placing blue prints just... doesnt work ever. On the off chance this system works anything like the blue print system then I fear if you load up one of your slots it would be like "camp cannot be placed as one or more pieces are floating." Etc. It would be nearly entirely worthless if more internal problems are not fixed and your amazing idea would just be lost to another bug.
---
I keep seeing references to this Todd guy/thing... someone want to clue me in??
---
I have three friends who are all under lvl 30 that i help. I run events with them constantly to help lvl them up. I also build them weapons and armor both pa and reg so I use a ton of materials  .
---
Todd Howard?
---
Yep, had to rebuild my entire house from memory when I accidentally replaced my camp. It was so demoralizing.
---
This is what I get when I sign in with my Bethesda account. I'm hoping I can sign in because my character was pretty maxed out when I signed out last.

Usually evenings PST, but I am off tomorrow! I'll be on for at least another 5-6 hours tonight!
---
well i was kinda enjoying myself until now. made it up to level 25 and im in the situation that every vendor has no money (btw this talk about 1400 or so a day? im lucky if i see 500, clear out a vendor of their caps and nobody then has anything). stash full, inventory full.
---
running out of cash, under 100 caps at the moment  
---
running super low on ammo, need to buy some, but got no money  
---
fast travelling everywhere takes money  
---
cant sell anything  
---
so cant buy ammo, or afford to fast travel. could wait for my camp to generate resources for me to sell to...er nobody  
---
No idea when the traders reset.  
---
So im in the situation that the game has actively forced me to quit because I can't do anything and i cant take the chance bouncing around the map looking for caps when you get charged for fast travel. and then even then there's a chance I will run out of ammo if its a big fight so im going nowhere.
---
if we dont retain the final  version of the appalachia map i will take vengeance on those responsible &gt;:/
---
reinstall the game?
---
Oh man, yes. Everything is limitations...
---
I get that it's necessary, but it makes me have to stop playing because I can't do anything I want to do. I get to sit around looking at my PS4 like... "wow really wish I could play fallout right now."
---
Weird, I just did the same thing and posted a question about 1 minute before you. Maybe something is wrong right now. Check out my post here: 
---

---
Check out the wayward inn.
---
I finish work in about 3 hours so hopefully I catch you! :)
---
I don't know if you're gonna get bulk ammo scrap from daily ops, but I do believe you just get flat out the ammo you are using. So, like 200 5.56 for example if you're using a handmade.
---
I looked at them and can’t say I am all that excited about any of them lol. I will check again but most of them don’t really apply to my playing style. If nothing else I will be happy to get rid of duplicate cards.
---
Lmfaooo just had this problem for the 5th time today and said out loud Jesus people where are your manners then I realize they even open my nuke cola machine door that really grinds my gears
---
Same issue as my post on xbox game pass microsoft store, no idea about your bethesda launcher issue but i know this is another launcher and another game. I need a fix as well
---
Same issue, hopefully someone has bypassed this issue and can help
---
You should!
---
It’s something that needs to be fixed I personally have two 3* Tesla rifles an assassins and a quad the quad is a lot of fun holding that chain of lighting for so long but most players should know not to use them in these events but people will be people and you have to just roll with it or it will drive you crazy
---
I don't see the problem. After the first few deaths most people learn to avoid work shops if they don't want Pvp. All this suggestion does it give people who actually want to build in workshops a way to defend themself. ( or I guess kill people wandering in who don't know it's a Pvp zone)
---
I know its an old post, but they still exist... Right outside flatwoods.  Ran to the wayward and there was an NPC that killed them.  Not sure how they have not been patched out by this point.
---
Yeah you're most likely right. I'm not super stoked about the instanced interiors. I despise loading screens and I'm sure I'm not the only one. I already avoid vendor hopping due to load screens unless I'm extremely board. I think if it's possible most people will put their vendors outside the instance. I'm not looking forward to 2 load screens to each vendor if they dont. Not to be a downer. I'm not likely to load into an instance just to check out someone's camp unfortunately.
---
Best light in the game imo.
---
It's garbage in general, granted that is just my opinion but PvP on this game is just not fun.
---
And yet another reason for me to be glad I'm on console.
---
This is the unfortunate truth about most "live service" video game monetization; right or wrong, they've decided the way to maximize profits is to go after whales, and people with addictive shopping or gambling behavior.
---
Without the specs of your machine it's going to be very hard for us to say.  First and foremost make sure all your video and audio drivers are up to date.  Second make sure that you don't have any programs running in the background that you do not need.  There is a chance that you might need to downgrade your settings or upgrade your computer but we really can't tell with the information here.  Also I can say that this game causes my computer to at least crash to desktop while I'm playing maybe once or twice a day.  I've never had it crash my PC such that I have to reboot it though.  I have also gotten much better results installing the game on my solid state drive.  I guess just do some basic computer style troubleshooting making sure everything's up to date and nothing extra is running and compare your computer specs to required specs for the game and go from there.
---
That's the Forest Scout Armor Mask
---
Fixed mine by submitting a ticket and having them unlink my psn account
---
I read on the wiki that Legendary perks are shared between characters, so account wide. Do you know if this is true or false information? Would be nice if I instantly had access to them on new characters.
---
One of the things I always thought was inaccurate about the other fallout games is the lack of new growth of plant life. Years after the bombs fell there will be all sorts of plants reclaiming the world.  In fact there are mods for the other fallout games that make the world greener for those of us who are bugged by the inaccuracy.  This is the first fallout game in which I found the flora seemed plausible.  So really it's more of a oversight and other fallout games than in this one.
---
 I have both consoles as well and FO76 on xbox, well i loaded that up the other day so i could try to play it over there and it was so blurry and slow fps i couldnt stand looking at it, almost gave me a instant headache. Once you play enough pc games console becomes very hard to migrate back to trust me
---
Why would there need to be dedicated locations?  Just have the camp do the check it currently does when you change servers, except this time you're deploying it from a menu rather than upon login.
---
Equipping power armor is an interesting way to see just how much carrying power your various other pieces of armor are giving you. in my case it was a shocking amount because of being deep pocketed on every piece of armor and a backpack with a mod.
---
Hats aren’t valuable at all
---
My understanding is *slots* are shared, not perk points or perk cards. 
---
Haveing said that, all rank one legendary perk cards are available free to those lv 50+. It's ranking them up that is individualized and costs coins
---
About 20 caps, max. They’re common items. 
---
The uniforms are a different story.
---
It’s the dresses that have value. The hats not so much
---
This isn’t the sub for that. Try one of the bartering subs.
---
I know when I'm having this issue sometimes if I restart my ps4 it is better and sometimes I just can't play. I haven't had this issue since we upgraded our internet and wifi. I had contacted support they Twitter and they told me to check my connection as they say it's a stability issue.
---
But then you become the wendigo
---
Hats aren't valuable but look for the Forest and Red uniforms. Those are listed as Ultra Rare

is there anything else i should list? thank you for the help!

i have not updated my gpu drivers and i know i do have an nvida update pending over the past week.
---
It's annoying when I join a friend's server and the CAMP can't be deployed, especially being in a popular spot. My friend would want me to join his server because it's popping  with nukes and is active, but I can't stay for long because I have my personal setup and store.
---
Hopefully after card loadouts we get to choose an alternative CAMP spot. Would even be awesome to purchase some kind of land lot license like for 5000 bullion and be able to deploy a 2nd CAMP.  It would make the world feel more unique with cool looking landmarks.
---
The thing is the USSS helmet costs more gold than anything in the set. Making it like a PA helmet makes sense
---
Im still waiting for a helmet with nightvision.  Not sure how the stealth chinese armour doesnt have it. Lets be stealth then add a blaring flashlight.
---
Submitted a ticket for mine, they told me there was nothing i could about it. Its likely because i dont show up on everyone elses social list, not the other way around.
---
That's not too bad actually, I plan on using Master Infiltrator and that will be good even at rank 1.
---
Don't really mind leveling them, I only plan on having 2 chars at most as I don't want to put in more effort than that, seeing as mats and plans are not shared.
---
Thank you for the reply!
---
The only reason anyone would use a gauss mini is because you can get FFR on it and the natural explosive effect, which the queen and Earle are resistant to. So it’s basically just a BFFR heavy, and there are better heavies to use than the gauss minigun on the bosses
---
I've wanted a holotape player for my camp for the longest time to play all of the Tales From The West VA Hills radio plays. It would be great to expand that with a quest to go find additional music holotapes that you could play at your camps. Suppose you could load the holotape player with 4-5 different holotapes and it would just play sequentially. Like a public audio channel for the 'sphere' your camp occupies.
---
The more other armor penetration you have, the better junkies is going to be. The lower your damage per shot, the better anti-armor is going to be. It's going to depend a little on which HW you're using. Stabilized has a little more armor penetration than tank killer, but I don't think heavy weapons have any armor piercing mods so that more than makes up for it when you're comparing to rifleman and commando.
---
Armor penetration is multiplicative, though you multiply (1-armor penetration) to get an armor coefficient, then multiply that by the enemy's DR or ER to get the final DR or ER, which then gets converted to a damage coefficient using that cool but messy equation.
---
A quick comparison of [final word to an equivalent junkies weapon](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html?left=R_W-FinalWord_L-45_ModReceiver-Standard_ModBarrel-Heavy_Prefix-Antiarmor_Major-FFR_PHP-100_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-0_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_HeavyAP-45_Other-0_Add&amp;right=R_W-50CalMachineGun_L-45_ModReceiver-Standard_ModBarrel-Heavy_Prefix-Junkies_Major-FFR_PHP-100_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-5_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_HeavyAP-45_Other-0_Add) puts final word only 6.4% behind after the nerf. For gatling guns (higher damage per shot) it's 8.6%. For miniguns it's 6.0%.
---
Power armor is not hermetically sealed
---
To be fair, a stealth approach is essentially impossible in the upcoming Daily Op mission, Uplink, so players will need to find a way to cope with that.
---
Sounds like you've ruled out the devices that you played on which leaves the headphones or the software.  If I had to guess I would say that these headphones have either a setting or a problem where they are activating based on noise coming through the headphone speakers.  try a different microphone and see if you have a similar problem if so it's a software issue if not it's those headphones.
---
Thanks!
---
I would suggest holding off on Bloody Mess until after the rebalance on Tuesday.
---
For various reasons, these sorts of damage perks (Max Rank Commando/Expert Commando/Master Commando included) really underperform in the new algorithm.
---
Because the game chooses 4-5 random spawn points on creating a camp, and players don't have control over changing them!
---
I'm ok with that.
---
I do really wish they gave the scrap box out for free...or even just put it partway through one of the season's and then have it purchasable in the Atomic Shop after.  
---
I'm thinking I'll do the same...get it for a month, cram scrap box, and enjoy the added benefits while I have them.  Currently between jobs and moving apartments so I hopefully don't keep going with it haha
---
That’s actually pretty cool! Thanks for filling me in, it paints a new picture of what fallout could have been
---
gesundheit
---
This same thing is probably desired for literally every online game
---
Unless the default spawn is ontop of a foundation, then you gotta RUUUUN else be eaten by the foundation!
---
Based on fact that in few days they will realise horrible update. After the update big chunk of playerbase will leave to never comeback. This will lead the game to slowly droping player numbers to eventually forcing bethesda to also leave the game
---
I miss having vaults that act like dungeons or caves.  It would have been cool to have two or three explorable vaults in various states of disrepair.  Gary.....
---
Bitch what the fuck
---
Those floater grenades need to be sellable ffs. Sorry about your gun.
---
The who now?
---
And for real. Those grenades. What the actual fuck. They're total inventory clogging dogshit.
---
Are you on pc? Theres a 99.999% you aren't but if so, I have a spare QE assault rifle that I can throw at ya
---
Is it. Fantastic
---
Thanks for the thorough response, very helpful.  I forgot about that "save player one" campaign...but great point.  
---
Unlimited scrap is really my main reason for looking into it, but the more I'm reading here the more I think I'll find a lot of value in the private server and the survival tent!
---
I actually got a couple decent weapons. A bloodied explosive minigun, an instigating minigun with faster fire rate, and a quad tesla. Everything was 3 star, I just don't recall the other effects right now.
---
That's about 1300 scrip worth.
---
Not really. It’s a recently manufactured story and set in the Seattle area, IIRC. 
---
Maybe if there was a Fallout set in the NW U.S., sure.
---
Yeah I dont understand why the game is still so buggy after being out for 2 years.
---
Thanks for the input, everyone!  I've decided I will splurge and get it for the month...at the very least, enjoy this month of playing a lot and fill up my scrap container.  I'll likely then do it every few months, depending on how it goes.
---
That was my issue.
---
No one could see me and id get booted from private worlds with it saying I wasn't friends with the world owner
---
Is definitely submit another.
---
They'll have a bunch of troubleshooting
---
If just say you know someone that had the same issue and an unlink / relink worked
---
It’s a Cryptid based out of west VA.
---
F
---
nope
---
No
---
Everytime I try to use the weapon displays smh
---
Are you on Discord? I'd be happy to go on some leveling runs with ya.
---
Also sent ya a friend request.
---
I would love that so much. My current CAMP was such a pain to get right, but I'd love to be able to try different spots without losing all that work.
---
I figured as much. Thank you!
---
I played before the season concept and like many people finished this last season.  My wife was the first to point it out but I believe she's correct; the season really made the game more of a chore than something I did for fun.  Having to log in every day and kill three deathclaws, build five pieces of roof, plant three crops, claim a workshop and one or two other miscellaneous things I wasn't planning on doing really just caused it to become a daily chore.
---
To be fair I like playing fallout games as an explorer kind of picking along through stuff as I see fit.  I had been playing 76 in this manner and having a fine time and had leveled up decently high by the time the season came along.  Looking back by comparison I definitely enjoyed playing before the season more and it has nothing to do with atoms as bonuses (that went away).  I wish that there was just weekly achievements and I could choose to bang them all out in one or two sessions rather than having to have a daily login chore.  If bethesda's goal was to squeeze more money out of this game I think it's having the opposite effect with me because I am just going to distance myself from the game for a while.  There are several other games coming out or have just come out that I am pretty interested in and I don't think a daily chore login is going to seem appealing.  All of that doesn't even take into account the fact that most of the prizes I got from the legendary run are things that I would not have purchased in the atom shop nor are they things I really have much of a desire for paid or not.  Overall I think you just have to play this game and all games the way that makes you happy and I have decided that daily challenges is not something that makes me happy.
---
Heck yeah.  Or even just five the guitar sword a musical function like the camp instruments.
---
That would be pretty cool now that I think about it
---
This!
---
Oregon be looking like a Nuclear Winter match rn
---
My name in the game is the same as my username on Reddit.  I'm always happy to run around with newer players and get them some XP while not letting them die and showing them some fun areas.  Feel free to hit me up and I can help you stay equipped and on the right path to at least level up.
---
What about Bethesda launcher to Xbox launcher? Can I do that?
---
I wish Bethesda would pay more attention to weapon skins for all weapons.  I think there should be at least three different skins available in the atomic shop for every major weapon type.
---
Ingrid cold right? Thought that was the name associated with the smiling man
---
This made me smile for whatever reason.
---
Thank you
---
Pretty sure what you are describing is exactly what blueprinting does. Any we all know how terrible that works, can't place item needs support... Or item is floating.
---
They have the right to be delicious! 
---
Upvote for the cannibals!
---
It sucks but just wait ten minutes and you will get to respawn and get rewards. First time I had it happen on encrypted and I waited and then after ten minutes I was able to and get rewards and had it happen during queen and also multiple times during encrypted. I try to warn everyone don’t leave game stay and it will let you get rewards
---
They really need to just put the fast travel mat back. Yes I know it was used for griefing but people inclined to do that found other ways to make trap camps anyway. Im at the point I avoid any camp vendors along the cliffs of savage divide because I either drop to my death on spawn or like you wind up on the bottom of the cliff and have to find a way up. All of which requires to much effort to view what will probably be a bunch of stuff I dont need.
---
I have at least one decent weapon for each type of ammo to use on low level enemies.  E. g.  A fixer/combat-rifle rechambered for .38.  This is a way better use for ammo you pick up in the game world compared to using the ammo converter.
---
Also, get a good lever action rifle.  Hits hard.  Low ammo consumption.
---
I forget what it was called but there was a app I used for destiny that let me check inventory and swap stuff from characters. Really wished we had something like that for fallout especially to swap stuff around.
---
I'm good with being a wendigo for a night.
---
Yes
---
It seems to me that every once in awhile I will get on a server that is just crashy.  I know correlation is not causation but anecdotally I believe these servers seem to have a lot of people with ammunition resource farming machines hidden underground at their bases.  I'm a just be assigning blame to something I don't like but I know that the last two super crashy servers I've been on have had underground ammo farming bases that seemed pretty taxing from the size that they were.  One camp was literally the entire camps budget underground with only a staircase and obligatory instrument to play to scoot underground.
---
It's what Ward sends you to retrieve.  If you'll notice, there's a rate glitch where a dead enemy will respawn and their loot will be laying out in the world, visible.  
---
Whenever you do the Daily: Vital Equipment and you locate a dead body with the equipment on it, look around the area within a couple of yards.  
---
Some of those locations are "dead spawns".  You will never find a living raider there.  Sometimes, they despawn.  Rarely, they do the glitch and leave their stuff in world.  
---
Added bonus: if you have them in your inventory when you do the Daily, you can turn it in right away, apparently even if it's not exactly what is "missing".
---
Shuush, they'll nerf it!
---
I'd use it
---
Damn that sucks I always worry when I’m half asleep that I did what you just did and so far I don’t think I have. Those floaters need to just go away. I also on a side not feel bad for anyone that wasted gold on the plans for them. Sorry man
---
Are you clairvoyant? Lol
---
Not valuable they have fixed spawns. I so far have every outfit but yellow and red. Supposedly the forest is second rare and I have two but no one wants to trade for it
---
well tbf i'm sure i'm not the only one with low or &lt; 3 perception
---
I find myself playing less due to the currency daily caps. Once I've hit them for the day, there's no reason to keep playing. The days I can get on, I will, but their current system isn't going to make me get on the days I can't. That may not be the case for their most active players, who I think they design around, but I feel like I'm part of the majority of players where these caps ultimately make us play less.
---
Because we are between seasons at the moment. Daily/weekly challenges will start again 9/15
---
Yeah but it’s just something to flaunt like, I’ve been playing a lot. I think I personally have all the Gold Bullion plans that matter so why not?
---
They buffed the level of our defences, but against the buffed enemies they're more than useless, they just draw more agro to your camp!
---
Why the fuck would they do that? People are already duping on their mains because they know the TOS holds as much value as a Zimbabwe dollar
---
They're not sealed.  If they were you'd be dead as they don't have any air.
---
correction, its not that CANT, its that you dont want to.  trust me i know how you feel , i have same issue as you BUT it doesnt mean you cant wear pwr armor.  you wear it when you must, and put up with not being able to run(or keep chinese armor handy)
---
There would still be a need to earn caps one way or another. Many items in game are worth more in caps than what we get in scrip imo
---
Thanks. I assumed that’s how it worked but glad to have a definitive answer.
---
Thank you. That’s the answer I was looking for. I did miss that ship also
---
You need flux mats? Nuke the Whitespring, seriously. Bethesda may have dropped the legendary spawn rate, but the ghoul refresh is still on point
---
What you do
---
Nuke the whitespring with a friend
---
Clear out the golf club, then swing to the cabins on your left looking out from the front of the golf club
---
Continue through all the cabins and swing right to the storage facility near the back entrance
---
Clear the cabins leading back to the golf club
---
Meet at golf club
---
You or friend leaves server and rejoins
---
This will cause the ghouls to respawn
---
Rinse and repeat until you're so OC of flux mats you have to make a conscious choice of what to drop so you can move
---
Do this whenever I run low on ionized meat as well, which is perfect for a bloodied carnivore like me
---
👍
---
#ThanosGauntlet
---
Honestly the most hilarious videos I’ve seen. Rewatched Nukashine just now.
---
That's. Why. They're. There.
---
World is screwed and people ask me why I don't want kids in 2020...
---
Daily Challenges are now only for the Season Legendary runs and award SCORE only. There is no longer any daily/weekely atom challenges. So while in between Seasons there wont be anything
---
1. You can only get 1400c from the robots a day. You can only store 800 lbs.  I put things I'm out of room to hold but can't bare to throw away for dirt cheap on my vendors. Don't feel bad buying and reselling to robots or using.  I price stuff to sell so I can get more caps. Serums sell for 500 caps to a robot vendor, yet players sell for 250-350 all the time as that is the going rate.
---
2. It's a game if they're having fun cheating let em, unless it's hurting you.  Besides Bethesda should fix their game, players shouldn't have to police it.
---
I like this idea! But only if it comes with a Settler Wanderer companion who will grab the guitar from your back and play a rift every 20-30 seconds.
---
if they re- release a faschnacht  bundle i'd definately get it.. wasnt playing at the time it was launched.. the way the collectrons sing sounds amazing
---
Are you thinking of Ishtar Collective?
---
Welcome to PVP scrub
---
Lol git gud
---
How do you make it so that you’d spawn on the rail?
---
In my opinion they are a overrated novelty. You can do great damage with other weapons without causing frame rate issues or killing yourself.
---
That being said if you really want one go for it. You will likely have to trade something highly sought after. Be careful on the trade scene lots of scammers will just take your stuff and dip. I highly suggest using a reputable courrier if trading high value items. Also please don't pay cash for one. Real money trading is just bad.
---
Why not? We already see a lot of players that look like them in the wild.
---
Yep
---
I assume you need it for legendary perks to work.
---
What they said.
---
Or his evil twin from another dimension. Did he have a goatee?
---
Like blueprints from FO4
---
Depends on damage type. The Asbestos Torso mod reduces damage from fire down to 0 which includes the falling embers when fighting Earl.
---
With 5 pieces of Troubleshooter's Sentinel armor, the insulated backpack, and refractor, I was taking nearly 0 damage from laser weapons from from robots and only minimal damage from the Imposter Sheepsquatch's laser beam.
---
But, yes, the game limits your damage resistance from reaching invincibility levels but if you focus all your mutations, perks, gear, and the new legendary perks into damage reduction, you can get pretty close.
---
Yup crashed twiced on my today (PS4)
---
I had a thought very much like this one, recently, when I built a CAMP at a location where I’d previously been, ages ago.
---
That's pretty funny.
---
&gt;I want to play this like a fallout game, not some stupid mmo.
---
Plays Fallout MMO. Complains it's an MMO...
---
We're there nukes launched on that server already?
---
Gonna max the ammo one immediately!
---
If it bites you and you get sick, it's venomous.
---
If you bite it and you get sick, it's poisonous.
---
I mean, the specific effect perks, maybe, but there are plenty to make any build better in some fashion. Even something as easy as Master Infiltrator and 5 SPECIAL perks, and any build could benefit.
---
Yeah, not everyone uses power armour. Not everyone uses chems. Hell, not every one even uses ammo. But something like free stat points and the ability to always have hacking/picklock available, or even completely ignored, benefits every build.
---
Hah I feel that. I use those concrete tire walls I got from the shop awhile back and they nibble at em for a while
---
The Funky Duds Legendary Perk should help a good deal with that, since even without putting any perk coins into it's it's already equal to two pieces of poison resist armor.
---
This is the problem. Being a cosmetic it shouldn’t be over 500
---
Why would you get a cake and not eat it? You just gonna stare at it? Dumbass analogy makes no sense lmao
---
Anyone who uses a gun is gonna max that one. Toss on ammo smith and super duper and end up with more ammo than you bargained for.
---
They don't seem to care much about fixing cosmetic stuff, however they designed it, no matter the bugs, it's set in stone or at the very bottom of their todo list to fix.
---
They still haven't fixed the weapon skin issues a lot of us have, where the skin doesn't apply to the whole weapon and leaves part of it unpainted and that was 8 months ago, CM\_PipBoy said "he would look into it".  It's ridiculous because I paid real money to have the skin and doesn't even work.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/elsw9y/gold\_handmade\_paint\_issue/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/elsw9y/gold_handmade_paint_issue/)
---
Seems like everybody just accepted it would never be fixed and don't complain about it anymore or I'm now the only one with this issue.
---
But they have no problem adding more and more stuff to their cash shop!  That's their priority.
---
That and the Stealth Suit is better at blocking radiation.  Power Armor still gets me +1/s.  Stealth Suit is &lt;1/s.
---
If it's for science...
---
We launch nukes for fun, what more needs to be said
---
U need some bloatfly glands?...
---
I swear I was able to buy like 5 of the Bulk Ammo Scrap from the Traveling Merchant who stops at my camp.
---
I still have fun with the level 20 version. If you have it revved up as you back away from Ghouls, they grind themselves up on it and don't seem to be able to smack you too much.
---
Like I said, feel free to join another world. Creating standards for players that don't experience this is also inconsiderate and childish. Telling me to grow up while attempting to guilt me at the same time was laughable. Your small inconvenience has had me miss out on multiple loot during ACP because apparently not using Teslas is considerate but letting me die and respawn outside, well thats just etiquette. Sorry, you're acting like a child, especially posting this on reddit for validation.
---
Not trying to say you’re wrong, but like what?
---
Most likely after the second meat week
---
Wait is that not still a thing ?
---
I've been wondering about this too. Since I missed last time Vault 94 was open and am not on PC, I dont have any of my own experience to compare.
---
But being detected is not an issue for a high agi stealth perked character in Earle or SBQ, or when surrounded by ghouls or mutants.
---
I know with one specific mutation, Daily Op enemies have higher perception. Apart from that, is there actually any threat to stealth players?
---
Not sure if I do need those. What purpose do they serve?
---
100% I built a great camp and I can’t bring myself to delete it, but I also really want to play around in other places on the map. I would like this very much!
---
That is why I favorite my guns. Sorry about your handmade mate
---
You seriously couldn’t google this? The info is publicly available
---
I think they call this diluted Fallout 1st. 
---
I see what you mean here but there is a server issue. You load in with 1 maxed camp &amp; then the game has to account for a stored camp. It just wouldn't work when it comes down to the bare bones of servers.
---
Good idea though. I want this but for perks. Have a couple different perk builds.
---
Why?  Just why??
---
I'm definitely keen for interiors, but I plan to mainly use them as a decorative sort of thing, and keep all the functional stuff (crafting stations, vendors) outside.
---
Yes and he needs to play underground rock music exclusively.
---
"Don't post about this, Bethesda doesn't care about you and you're wasing space." 
---
Sorry, just channeling all the whiny neckbeards on this sub.
---
Items float in mine but it’s barely noticeable. I still like the bunker regardless
---
You're right, and then some, it seems. Angry Turtles new video suggests AA is neck and neck with *bloodied* for heavy PA users.
---
https://youtu.be/9EeNcV7OxZU
---
Then TSE tops all of them :/ gonna have to rummage out my December 2018 TSE handmade haha
---
_Extended monologue in muffled screaming that sounds vaguely like threats of evisceration, then Earth Angel starts playing._
---
1) Bethesda didn’t do anything. It’s a Zenimax ToS which was also updated for ESO. 
---
2) Zenimax (Bethesda’s parent company) is not a publicly traded company. Meaning metrics like “player base” are meaningless. These numbers only matter for investors who can see them as potential increase in profit (and thus increase in their investment).
---
Maybe they changed it, but I'd heard that it doesn't matter if the ore vein is empty. Just activating the empty vein spawns the Scorched.
---
It’s double barrel, pump, combat in terms of damage, but DB  unless you have double/quad is a pain to really use effectively. Pump is the middle ground where you have to load each individually, but you have more than 2 rounds. Combat has a magazine for faster reload, but less damage per shot.
---
This is not including Gauss as Gauss is just trash.
---
So would I. I don't see why it can't be either a download or a disk in the future.
---
Yes, just like the game warns you when telling you how to.
---
Yes ! Thank you I was about to Google what it was haha.
---
BGS will read this and will not add this and give some excuse.
---
Yes, it is an excellent weapon if you are a Bloodied Vats Commando, not quite the very top, but excellent non the less.
---
If there are nuke zones on the map the may be locked.  The enclave gives you a missle holo tape to check the status of all 3 nuke silos.
---
lol ty for offer but im on xbox ...only had this bug once in 4500 hours but this is what i had done to fix it without closing otu the game
---
Awesome thanks!
---
Yezzir
---
ouch
---
I just tried with the pickaxe and it's not showing for me either. Don't have a poon handy but I'm guessing same result there.
---
Tbh it was that or the Atomic Shop
---
I remember when games were designed with the intent of supplying fun and enjoyment to the customer. Too many games now require a grind to access content, daily limits to slow the progress of those who play all day, or even micro transactions to get all of the original content created before launch. Many games feel like a chore that we have to schedule our lives around to get our moneys worth. I say screw all the limits, let those who want to have everything as fast as possible by playing 20hrs a day get what they want, and let casual players earn the stuff as/when they can. 
---
I grew up absolutely loving to play pool. I would play any chance I could get. Convinced my parents to get a table when I was a teenager and played all the time. Hit 21 and used to go to the bars and play regularly. Then some friends convinced me to play A.P.A.(American Pool Players Association). After 2 seasons of having to play certain days and times because that's what was needed, it started taking the fun out of it. I haven't played pool in probably 6-7 years. Both pool and gaming are things that I've loved doing since childhood. One has already been ruined by requirements/restrictions to when and how I played, which was my fault to be honest. The other is being ruined by companies who would rather make a few extra bucks now, then have a customer for life.
---
Sorry, rant over. I love gaming and see this stuff way too much and it kinda sucks.
---
Shhh. I just moved near Crater.  Though I am not sure I am happy with my build so I may move again.
---
I think it was manually started back then. I remember doing the main quest as a low level last year and when I got to Fort defiance it would pop up on my hud. I started it on two sperate occasions before figuring out it wasn't part of the main quest.
---
There are none that I can see of on the map
---
I don’t see any zones on the map
---
They actually said they’re going to expand the CAMP budget but sadly they’ve been completely silent on everything else. I completely agree with you. This really turns me and many other players away from the game.
---
one spot as in my (previously) own workshop?
---
yes.  my fist nuke run was 8pm on a monday.  The codes reset an hour before and it ate my only card.  It a rite of passage.
---
Thanks for checking. If it's not just me then I might send Bethesda a ticket about it. Thanks again.
---
&gt; Why would you get a cake and not eat it? You just gonna stare at it? Dumbass analogy makes no sense lmao 
---
That's such a dumb statement there's nothing I need to respond to.
---
Song suggestions, volga boatmen song and the march from wizard of oz, oooeee o.. eeeoooo o
---
I drop my floater grenades right in mumbles face after spending my scrip. Saves the risk of dropping a weapon and helps with the weight of the usless scrip I'll be carrying till i can grind it up.
---
Simply put yet very true. I like it
---
Oh man it was my backpack mod I had just added it so I didn't even think of it thank you.
---
We are on vacation.
---
Plays latest fallout game, complains that cunts make it not fun
---
That’s the problem I have been having. Even with faster reload time, it’s still a reload.. thank you for the response!
---
It was my backpack mod I didn't even think of that thank you.
---
Pretty sure they're there to collect resources
---
Yeah what if I don't want PvP
---
Still waiting on that enclave bunker
---
Definitely the best commando vats weapon you can get. Look up reduced ap cost mods and you will either never lose ap or it will take 14 mags to empty your bar.
---
supposedly with tge new patch on tuesday they cant place their camp with those machines in them.  They also fixed the glitch that it permanetly takes up their camp space.
---
The best? I thought it was just a bit above average. Everyone seems to have a bloodied handmade these days
---
Go hunting Fog Crawlers, hit the pylon nearest to Abandoned Bog Town, the random encounter spot at NAR near Watoga, Tanagra Town,  and the Crater over at the Monorail Elevator.
---
I believe that the BOS vendor at Watoga and at Whitesprings sell it. Also, check on/around the tool boards in Red Rockets, there's usually some of them there.
---
Sorry for the ultra late response. Your mistaken as to which machine this topic is referring to. Your thinking of the ammo converter. (which did not even exist yet when my post was originally made) The one this thread reffers to is the ammo press machine which you earn via gold bullion from the raiders. That one simply produces a small amount of a selected ammo type over time, it doesn't require anything but a power source.
---
No prob :)
---
Holy shit how are people not aware of this
---
Wait a sec. in fallout lore? I didn’t even hear about Germans in fallout.  Very cool.  I don’t think Germans are Nazis btw.  Just the ones from the 30’s and 40’s.
---
Probably because there aren't any.
---
It bothers me that I have to explain because it's so self evident but I'll explain anyhow.
---
To server hop easily as a team (I'm assuming 4 people) you need 4 free slots in any world you jump to. Since Bethesda's code is so basic that rather than find a world with free slots you hop between, it picks a random world and you just try your luck.
---
Probably not an issue during off-peak hours, but during peak, good luck. I sometimes have to join a queue to play with just one friend, let alone four.
---
Self evidently, you can pick to hop easily as an individual or you can hop around as a group and it can be a pain in the arse. You just cannot have both because firstly Bethesda is so far behind in being able to cater for it that it'd take too much work and beyond even that, it's such a niche thing, it'll just never happen. 
---
We'll probably see text chat before we get this request fulfilled, and that's such a low priority for Bethesda, despite being the single most requested feature by Bethesda's own admission, that it's just not happening.
---
So, again, stay as a team or hop servers easily - pick only one.
---
Handmades are crazy good. Only people that can't crit spam would like ffr more.
---
Yes I am on PC... But thanks for the offer, I'll be OK... I'll take this as my lesson to read that stupid dialog more closely... It was the same friggin thing as the floater grenades... I just instinctively clicked yes...
---
Yeah but they logically do. Energy weapons break faster by default. Explosive weapons also break faster.
---
Beauty idea
---
I believe without strange in numbers and class freak that’s exactly how it would work, as the buff you get as part of the team would be less than the nerf (again, without the cards). BUT, with the two perk cards it flips those numbers around and you get a net benefit.
---
I made a jail cell for her cuz she’s getting my nerves ugh women can’t live with em cant live without em touching your guitar every 15 second
---
I had the gun favorited and skinned. Apparently, with a skin the message on drop isn't the favorite wheel message but the atomic shop item message (above)...
---
Noclip documentary about 76s creation iirc
---
Yeah, I don't know why they thought trying to mash two incongruous groups together would work. Both sides are only interested in half of what's on offer, and few people really get what they want as a result. 
---
My idea would be to split up the workshops into competitive and cooperative zones. Highly contested and super useful workshops like power plants that can make fusion cores, and the munitions factory would be PvP zones, with it being made crystal clear at the outset that it shall be full on war. Stepping foot inside the zone means anyone also inside can kill you at any time. No cheap shots; just glorious battle.
---
Cooperative zones would be no PvP, community owned zones. Nothing could be locked; every resource extractor, door, or terminal would be fully accessible to anyone who comes along and anyone can open the build menu and change what you've done.
---
Serendipity?
---
...not for too much longer...
---
I've recommended earlier that we should have power armor backpacks in the form of laser minigun packs from the other fallouts.
---
Yep — https://youtu.be/OqwoKVJQ46A
---
Read the description on the video for the full test breakdown. Even in a solo public team, empath procs for you as long as you have the class freak card at three stars, because technically even by yourself, you’re still part of a team when you’re in a public team.
---
Weird I am in a group 100% of the time for the  massive bonuses and haven't once interacted with a teammate.
---
I'm taking about ww1 germans 1914 to 1919 as for ww1 happening everything stays the same till after ww2
---
Hmm a bunch of meat heads rolling up in their power armor and making demands after we donated millions of supplies just so they have a place to lay their heads at night? Sounds like a lot of fun.
---
for... one violent night? :O
---
Like it or not 76 IS an MMO at it's core.    
---
You don't understand the wasteland or an apocalypse if you're griping about someone taking you or others down and your stuff. I for one am glad they kept PvP optional as well as how Workshops work.
---
Good weapon. I have a bloodied handmade and it’s good not the best prefixes but still good.
---
Dude, don't enable them.
---
Bloodied is still one of the best damages even after the update
---
Stay safe people. There's a fire 15 miles away from me here in Oregon, but it looks like they've got a good hold line going. I'm lucky to still be able to stay in my house. I can't imagine what others who had to evacuate are going through. One of my family members down in North Cali lost everything. It has not been a fun couple of days.
---
I laughed at the 'meat heads rolling up in their power armor'. I do agree, they seem like right bollox's in general but it's good to see another faction introduced.
---
Concerning look, I like the Scout Armor and it's underarmor variants. Given a build then it could be anything. A tank/melee/heavy gunner should have the biggest, most damage reducing, powerful armor or PA they can get and mod.    
---
My main is a Steal Sniper and almost has a full set of Scout Armor one of which has a Chameleon effect. I'm not big on cosmetics.
---
You realize that's being fixed with Patch 22 right? I also have heard from people in the PTS that the Fast Travel bug is apparently fixed as well. Or at the least not happening as often.
---
Huh. R u sure? I swear I have gotten the favorite menu message tho...
---
It might be a “magic” shotgun, certain perks are buggy and can cause massive damage in VATS I think
---
https://youtu.be/9mRX-MEPzhs
---
I agree but I would personally much rather see a return of the Responders.
---
Not if I have problems like this it won't
---
LOL this hits close to home. Especially after shelling out all that cash for the Power Armor edition...
---
Rolled 6 times last night.. got bashing damage on 5 of them.. some were 2*  and some were 3* all consecutive rolls.
---
It still honestly feels like FO4 came out last year
---
You say PvP is optional and yet I had no choice in the matter.
---
If you all want to kill each other that's fine, let me play it like the single player RPG EVERY OTHER FALLOUT GAME IS
---
Unless Beth hands all the networking tools to us so we can host our own servers wherever and whenever
---
It’s ok. The radio is so loud they dont even notice the light.
---
That would be pretty excellent!
---
Scorched Earth outside of the nukezone seems like an unintended bug that is now a community demanded feature. Spawning into nuke zone is just the hangover
---
This is exactly what I was thinking. Not to convert the game to single player but rather to simply preserve the game
---
I normally have to try multiple times too. If it isn’t something you need to get to in a hurry wait a few seconds and it seems to help sometimes.
---
100%. Maybe even a newer online fallout for next-Gen consoles
---
It finally worked for me on about the seventh server doing the blood analysis first and then entering the T-fuse.
---
Agreed. It’ll all be based off your hardwares memory anyway
---
Then don’t claim workshops. It’s that simple.
---
It’s a terrible design oversight that “yes” is highlighted by default. Sorry about your gun :(
---
There 1000% will be. It’s a huge profit opportunity that Bethesda almost definitely won’t pass up
---
PvP can be turned off. If you hit him/her and they hit you back it's GAME on.  
---
Every other Fallout game is solo and everything but your character is an artificial program. Big difference. Out of 3 char's one 118 and two at 50 and 38 I have never had your problem.  
---
Ignore people who pester me with damage. I don't keep workshops for long and if it's taken after I leave they can have it. If you hate the 'other live people' aspect then learn to work around this or stop playing.
---
Bethesda designed the workshops as PVP zones.  Bethesda designed the workshops to be contested spaces.  Bethesda designed the workshops to be locations that players fight over.  Bethesda designed the workshops as.....
---
I mean, come one.  How many ways does it have to be said?  I'm really sorry you don't like the reality of the situation, but it's how that part of the game was designed and how the creators wanted it to be played.
---
By that point I’m sure Bethesda would be long passed 76 to care
---
All aboard the Nostalgia train!
---
So question about that: Is the Brotherhood Spec Ops Uniform a Plan or is it just the outfit/mask?
---
All three?  
---
It does that when NOT in VATS. In VATS it does more b/c I have Concentrated Fire at R2. I don't even have Master Shotgunner at max rank. All three shotguns deal between 210 and 310 damage per shot.  
---
Let me add that damage is from the weapon stats when you inspect it not from in-game performance.
---
LOL
---
Something like Appalachian Pirate radio stations but with holotapes. Give me holotapes with music
---
Oh buddy. Your comment just makes me sad.
---
There's little I disagree with what you've said. We just don't live in that world anymore.
---
At the end of the day, it's really on us, not the games industry. If the game feels like a chore, maybe it's on you to just not play it.
---
By playing the game, or worse still, continuing a Fallout 1st sub or paying for Atoms, you're rewarding such profiteering and intentionally lowering the quality of your game to make it more grindy so that people will play longer with less content. Why would any game dev change this behaviour if we keep rewarding them for it?
---
For me, I treat this game and Bethesda the exact same way it treats this game and its players - I use it for what its worth and discard it until it has something of value to offer again.
---
Life is too short to either reminisce on how things use to be or to play a game that's a chore. Put your time and money into things, games or otherwise, that are worthy of your time and money.
---
So which is it? Are they wanted or unwanted levels?
---
Yup! I’m all for building in 76 and FO4 so it would be great to preserve my CAMP builds
---
Other players can't hear your Pipboy Radio, wouldn't be surprised if enemies can't in 76 either.
---
So?
---
If you don’t want PVP, why are you taking workshops? You can put extractors in your camp if you select the right locations.
---
Thank you for the information. I completely forgot about that workaround. I did that with my wife and brother once and I didn't need mats for a few weeks. It was awesome!
---
Which will allow modders to create custom DLC/ items
---
I like you.
---
Must be new. This is a feature round here.
---
That would be nice if true. But really its Bethesda. How many bugs have been "fixed" now only to come back in the next patch?

Seeing someone take out their camera at my camp is one of the best things that could possibly happen for me. It's not a perfectly built, beautiful model home, but I have some really weird and offbeat things set up that I'm sure others with a strange sense of humor will appreciate. Currently my favorite part is the entire floor around my vendors being covered in meat piles and Gramps dressed in a clean Chally costume nearby with a theremin in front of his chair to serenade other players while they're shopping knee deep in gore.
---
I wonder what the new instanced player camps are going to be like? Will they allow unlimited storage, or nearly so? From what I've read, they will have a large build limit, and be player specific, so it's only loaded when you enter it, which I presume is much less server load than having a large camp in the open world.
---
So, if the build limit is large, will it have it's own stash that's also large or even unlimited? So, bring all your crap into the instanced camp and drop it there, better than throwing it away or using a mule, which is a giant pain, I've helped a friend transfer stuff from his and got some nice weapons and ammo he wasn't using from it, but still it was really awkward.
---
Even if there isn't a stash in the instanced camp, I'm sure there will be display cases of some type, just build a ton of those and drop stuff into them.
---
That of course, doesn't answer the currency limits, which really are a pain to deal with, though for scrip at least, you can drop extra legendaries in your camp instance and store them there until the scrip refills, but really, after a while, you'd have so many you'd never be able to turn them all in. Main caps and scrip limits really need to be increased dramatically. I don't do much with all that stuff yet and I still hit the limit too soon, I can imagine someone who plays more would be really frustrated with it.

Any other guitar players miffed by "guitar" sword? It doesn't even have a usable neck, and even considering using open/purely harmonics for use, any real tension would probably mess up the already bent "neck".
---
If anything they should've made a guitar "Axe", cause that's a no-brainer.
---
Oh lol. Yea. I understand. Hope you get your booze 😂
---
It’s still up to a +90/95% damage boost compared to a max of +50% from any other prefix.
---
I just want console commands back lol
---
Let us settle this as gentleman, and use only the finest and most distinguished of firearms.  Letbus use the black powder pistol.

I got excited at first until I read the whole title. :&lt; I love some good tin foil hat theories about actual stuff in the game.

Just the outfit &amp; mask, no crafting plan

Pretty good. I'd trade my b2525 handmade for it

There needs to be a confirmation button after you hit submit: *(‘Did you use Google or this subreddit’s search function before posting this?’)*

I hope to god Fallout 5 ain't like that. I just want my console commands and non-robot NPCs at the start. Keep it to spin-off games
---
Lol I wanted to know if there was a solution. Idky u got all triggered and rude buddy
---
"We want basic QoL features like text chat!"
---
You: "Oh my gawd, your so spoiled!"
---
I don't need to hear you out, you had me instantly. This game features instruments so heavily that a guitar slung on your back makes perfect sense.
---
I've used a quad double-barrel, instigating/aim damage pump action, anti-armor/fire rate combat shotgun and anti-armor pump action.
---
Quad double barrels are the only real option for sustained dps, what you need against bosses like earl or even run of the mill scorchbeasts. It is really fun. I saw a quad/faster fire rate one but didn't bother upgrading from my 1 star because it's limited more by recoil than by max fire rate in most situations. On paper though that would be a real beast.
---
Pump action shotguns are bad for sustained dps no matter the prefix because they fire slow and take forever to fully reload. But you can put a silencer on them and they have tight spread and high damage, so they're great for stealth. Instigating is definitely best for this since it will kill most things in one stealth headshot.
---
Combat shotguns are nice because they reload quick and you can put a perforating magazine on them for armor penetration, but they are still way behind the quad double barrel for dps. If you can find an instigating one it will be pretty good for stealth.
---
Interesting to hear about the gauss, I haven't tried it but looking at the numbers it definitely looked like trash unless it's magic.
---
Aw man that would be so cool! Something else I've thought about is having a single player version take place partially before the scorched virus, so you could see stuff like the destruction of the Charleston Provisional Government, Maxsons order to hoard technology, etc. live then go and witness the apocalypse
---
What secret room?
---
I’m always in favour of more raiders to kill and loot
---
I have a quad handmade you can have. Not explosive but I feel for you.
---
I mean, I'm hoping he has a Instigating, Troubleshooting, Anti-armor black powder anything for that 1,000 robot kills I gotta do.
---
This has been covered a hundred times, unlimited junk stash is fine because its a set list of items increasing the value as more items are deposited. A normal stash has to load different codes for every single item. 10,000 wood takes up significantly less server power than 10,000 different versions of the fixer.
---
Yikes. Well that's definitely gonna take me awhile but hey I'm up for it!
---
Meh. Would rather see some 76 factions or Enclave.
---
The room around the back of the building or am I getting my locations mixed up.
---
Wahaha!! Right on, you made me laugh, you silly clown!
---
The real question is why can't we completely lock an item so it can't be sold or dropped?
---
Ah, yes, the assholes barging in to commandeer everything and act like they're in charge?
---
They can fuck right off.
---
In reality, I'm glad the game is adding new factions and content, but to be honest, I'd rather set up the Responders. Or the Enclave. Or a faction of Hostile Feral Ghouls riding Suicider Yao Guai and throwing Floaters.
---
I hope they aren’t like FO4 BOS because I actually wanna side with them but if they too much of asshats imma just murder them 😂
---
Yes they are, contrary to what most people think most games out there are running on 20 year old engines. They just update them, unreal engine is still the most commonly used game engine today and its from 1998.
---
I like that.  Though I'd say have a Primary and Secondary.
---
The Primary is the one that the game tries to "activate" when you login, then if you were to get a "find a new world cause some bastard is in your spot" for the Primary you could choose to "find new world" or "use Secondary camp assuming some bastard isn't also there too."
---
It’s next year bro 2026

My bad it kept saying that I needed to wait to post even tho I didn’t post anything. So I guess instead of it making me wait it kept posting it
---
Defiance got one for Xbox One for the dozens of people interested still interested in that game. It is still getting support/events/updates. I can't imagine fallout would ever have a smaller player base.
---
My gauss shotgun is doing that to. It only started yesterday. On of the many bugs.
---
Yes if you go from Shotgun to melee then that is much easier.  However as you already said pistols and rifles are very different and you are not going to get the bang for your buck if you try and be good at both.
---
Do you mean this one? 
---

I do occasionally feel like we are not supposed to want to play this game the way they set it up.
---
By default, as a tried n true Bloodied unyielding player, I throw my hat in with the Yau Guai riding horde of Ferals.   We're basically Ghouls as it is
---
No it sucks I’ll take that trash off your hands
---
Colour me impressed, But how in the Fuckery did you start to even build up there?
---
Also was that stair case just suit cases?
---
Robert Edwin House being name dropped in both 4 and 76. Vera Keyes being mentioned in Far Harbor. Expanded lore for Nuka Cola Victory, Nuka Cola Quartz, and sunset sarsaparilla in Nuka World. Newspaper discussing a shootout that occurred at the Ultra Luxe in 76. The upcoming Brotherhood content supposedly has someone recruited from the Mojave along the way.
---
Like... I get it guys, New Vegas is fun, that's why I'm working on mods for it. But jesus christ if the diehard New Vegas and classic fans don't have the single largest victim complex of all time, and they can't even be truthful about how they're being victimized *because they're not but like to pretend they are.*
---
Where do you see the release date?
---
Nice.
---
I wouldn’t count on this happening. Also if anyone attempts to host a bootleg server, I can totally see Bethesda putting a legal smack down on it quickly.
---
This similar thing has happened in many now-extinct mmos. It’s ultimately the hardest thing to wrap your head around as an online game player. The fact that you don’t own the game, you don’t own the sever or your character or any of the items in it.
---
They can ban you or shut down their service without any obligation to you. You in fact agree to all this when you click accept on those license agreements.
---
As someone who has been playin mmos for 22 years now (yes that long). My best tips to you are a) record some videos of your housing and character in action for posterity (memories) b) learn to never get too passionate about loving the game. Easier said then done when you play stuff for many years for multiple thousands of hours, but still you must learn. Just always be prepared to walk away from the  gam at any random day and move on.
---
UI need a bit of work, yeah. If you sell things too quickly at a merchant in a filtered category, it can sell things from outside of that category randomly. Luckily I haven't lost anything too important to it yet, but it's obnoxious.
---
As others have said I would have rather seen "The Rise of the Enclave".  I would have also rather seen the BoS be the locals who survived by fleeing the area, regroup and return.  This is supposed to be based in WV why bring folks from CA all the way to WV.  Heck we had already heard recording of the people who were local and we would have had a better affinity for them vs. outsiders from another area coming in like they own the place.
---
This is just out of control awesome!!  Love the tiki vibe 👹🍹
---
From the lore for the T-51b, "To further enhance protection against direct contact with and contamination by radioactive, biological or chemical substances, the armor can be made airtight, allowing its operator to explore even the most contaminated areas with reasonable safety as long as the armor is not compromised.[13] The helmet is an integral part of this protection, fitted with a rubberized cowl mounted to the chest plate and providing a tight seal"
---
So it would or could be hermetically sealed to be airtight and provide NBC rated protection
---
Well what is it then?
---
It's a decent weapon. VATS crit ain't the best but it's not terrible either. Rest is pretty awesome, especially for a vats commando (stealth or otherwise).
---
You make sure to pay it forward, is the way!
---
To the first question. I put ammo, chems, and explosives that I don't use in the machine at 1c each so that someone who uses it can get a good deal. I honestly don't care if someone buys to resell. Legendary drops get converted.
---
I'm more interested in new content, story and lore than I am about the Brotherhood specifically. I'd be equally excited with an equivalent Enclave, Responders, Cultist, etc. DLC.
---
This isn’t an issue they are going to fix. According to them, it wasn’t supposed to proc on Tick Blood. So they fixed it accordingly. 
---
If you need Tick Blood, hit up Tea Time when it shows on the map. Lots of ticks show up for that.
---
You're a sus
---
Any overclocking?
---
It doesn't matter how stable you think it is, it's only stable until it isn't.
---
How about upping limit on both
---
I just tested it with a 10mm SMG + Free States paint, yea adding it to the favorites wheel does F-all...
---
If you remove the paint, you get "ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DROP THIS FAVORITED ITEM?"
---
What do ya know, without the paint, it gives you clear options "Drop favorited item" and "Don't drop" and it defaults to the conservative option "Don't Drop"!
---
This has been going on for several months now. Now it's starting to happen when I'm trying to get to an event.

Loot drops are already diluted enough. So no new weapons please unless they perform identical to current bis.
---
you're very kind, I think I'm OK for now... I'll let this be a lesson... thank you though!
---
This.
---
Yeah have the set you earned from the vault raid
---
I like getting a disease when I shoot an infected enemy over a distance of 50 meters
---
I have a mixed set of whatever decent stuff I came across on my first character. The centerpiece of it is a 3\* vanguards heavy robot chest piece that looks great with the black shovel backpack. Or did, after that one backpack update the shovel now clips through part of the armor :/ With metal, marine and SS limbs mixed in it looks really cool with that skull helmet.
---
My full time PA melee guy wears full regenerating BOS armor, partly for looks, partly so that when I'm in my camp crafting stuff my health comes back.
---
My third character was going to only use PA for nuke zones, earl and lucky hole mine, with just a set of excavator. I was thinking tankiness since he's a shotgunner so I went BOS heavy combat armor with Vanguards. After playing for a while though, I want tankier power armor for earl, and stealthier armor for everything else, so I'm looking for better sneak gear (which turns out to be really hard to find.) Also after [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ipkny3/armor_rating_diminishing_returns/) it looks like I'd be better off with a mixed set of enemy specific gear than with vanguards, but that's not the popular opinion so no one sells it.
---
As for your question, unyielding and sentinels are not mutually exclusive so the correct answer is both. Note though that sentinels doesn't work when you're sneaking, so if you're a bloodied stealth command you're maybe better of with unyielding cavaliers (if you have to stand up you might as well run away while you're at it) or better sneak armor.
---
Plays game, complains that it doesn’t conform to his wishes even though it’s explicitly clear that it doesn’t conform to his wishes even before he buys it. 
---
It’s like going to Taco Bell and complaining you can’t get a Big Mac. Like duh motherfucker, *that’s not what we serve here*
---
This is an online game. Hell, at launch it was MUCH more PvP-centric. It’s already had 90% of the previous PvP elements removed. You’re complaining about literally the last remaining one. 
---
If you wanted a single player (and thus inherently non-PvP game), then why did you buy this game?
---
Really? I was under the impression it was a bug
---
Same, it got to be too much managing to have fun.
---
Dem moufs tho
---
I think they’re arachnids, but I’m not sure. 
---
;)
---
Excuse me?
---
No. You clearly agree to PvP when paying for it.
---
Uh... I am not 100% certain if that flesh is not rotten...
---
Regardless, they’re the only humanoid we can’t consume. So yes. Let’s see it happen.
---
And let cannibals eat from the meat piles we can build at camp, too. Put it on a cool down, so you can’t spam it, with a solid chance at disease, but it would be a nice utility.
---
Also - when will cannibals gain the benefits of carnivore? The lore for the mutation flat-out says further testing was canceled when the subjects started referring to people as meat. I think that means human flesh counts.
---
I... I think that’s enough. You’re not going to eat me now, right? (/s for this last sentence, is a joke since one of my friends is a cannibal build you are my character several times in The days of yore. And killed themself once after I irradiated them before they consumed.)
---
Just throwing this out there I got a guad double barrel on pc if anyone wants it...
---
Or do so in a private server. Don't want to pay for it? Make friends.
---
With how Dr works in this game it really doesn't matter. If rather have higher rr and a tiny bit of extra damage. Since you rely don't take much more damage in sh vs t65

She's nice :(

If she was a witch, she'd charge 501 legendary scrip for explosive

double shot guns.

Any and every workshop on a public server.
---
Hey I'm having trouble visualizing your layout but the two basic rules for higher floors is: it has to be connected to a set of stairs, and it has to be 'upper floors', not regular floors or roof.
---
Hell yeah then I can log in for 5 minutes instead of 10!
---
This char has been on the backburner for awhile.  
---
My focus is my main at 118 so having unlocked 3 Legendary Perk slots is good for all three of mine.  
---
I've never used a Gauss Shotgun. This char hasn't finished Wastelanders and just hit 50 tonight.
---
You had the choice to not claim a workshop. 😐
---
It's not just legacies. Regular legendaries do the same thing.
---
That would be the Vault Boy headlamp.
---
You used to be able to. When they made it so you could lock the shutters is when it messes it up. It’s an extra step, but you can place the wallpaper on a regular wall and then change the wall type to window and the wallpaper should stay.
---
The online server is:  
---
  
---
A: the database - it houses all your variable data.
---
B: the GM - it instructs units to spawn at particular levels and triggers changes in the game world.  
---
C: security.
---
This is gonna sound weird as fuck but it worked when a lightening storm killed my power causing this to happen to me. Start up another game close it and then start fo76. Not sure why but it worked for me.
---
Ssssshhhhhhhhh don't ask
---
I’ve done colossal problem twice and both times died right before we killed earl. 1st time I was spawned outside of the mine and second time I spawned up top and the floor was covered so I couldn’t jump down. Yea I got the rewards for the event but couldn’t loot the bodies.
---
This is why I refuse to use weapon skins until Bethesda creates a locking system for weapons, armor and clothing.
---
Oh I get it. Believe me.
---
I exclusively use assassin's sentinel armor. The sent is enough to deal with PvE enemies. You can stand still (no crouching) or jump up and down and it will reduce damage by 15% per piece 75% of the time. 
---
Types I prefer are leather, combat &amp; scout. 
---
You can have both uny &amp; sent in one armor piece.
---
*I didn't choose the grind. The grind... chose me.*
---
I would love to see a Saturnite fist skin from fallout new vegas
---
Nope.  Neither of you know the release date.  I don't follow the devstreams or twitter feeds etc., so I thought they might've said something.  I guess they didn't, and you two are full of shit.  Nice going, idiots.
---
One of three things:
---
1.) They lied because Vault Tec loves lies and we can pretend that maybe they didn’t want to accidentally kill any late stragglers with a reason for leaving late. 
---
2.) You, being alone, and bored, fixed the equipment or got a Mr. Handy to, to keep yourself alive until boredom took you. 
---
3.) Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, no logic here.
---
Ty sir.. Thats my job
---
Ghoulish makes you pretty resilient against ghouls. If I pop a diluted rad-x, I can let a few level 62 ghouls wail on me for a few minutes without having to worry about it too much... and that's without any armor.
---
Maybe. Like I said. They don’t seem that interesting to me, aside from being able to get rid of excess cards. 
---
I will be happy when they perk load outs are available so I can just click on the sets I want depending on what I am doing.
---
So before season pass came out it would ding but now it just happens. Don’t farm ticks just get commie bot and have him collect blood packs and use chemist and super duper and you will have so many stims. But yeah it changed to where it just happens now with out popping up
---
I’ve literally never had that happen since public teams launched. On PC
---
This must be your first mmo....
---
They just need to change the favorites system. Favoriting an item would not add it to the wheel, it would just make it not able to be dropped, scripped or scrapped. They would rename the favorite wheel to the quick item wheel or something like that, and make it work the same way except a different symbol in your inventory
---
It will be cool to see NPCs in non-raider power armor. I'm also hoping they've figured out how to integrate backpack upgrade technology into power armor so I can stop having to run traveling pharmacy everywhere.
---
Nukacrypt. Just launched one an hour ago. I actually followed a player in, helped him get to the end and let him launch the nuke since it was his solo run. He just stood at the keypad and did the confused emote. After a minute or two I figured he didn’t know what to do or had the wrong code.
---
Explain yourself a little more
---
Glad to know I’m not the only one. I would take photos of my camp because I very well could be wrong, but currently traveling this weekend prevents me from hopping on the game.
---
Kill them all 
---
(unless they have cool rewards, then I’ll get those first and kill them after)
---
There is a damage cap. Shouldn't really be dying to a sniper.
---
......
---
Oh you sweet summer child.
---
Well I mean it IS an option so not sure why it never showed up for you. But yes like the guy said you have to continuously flirt with him as the quest line progresses if you want to romance him.
---
The BEST headlamp.  Like ...can grow “things” in a closet good.  
---
All jokes aside though...the headlamp on the SS helmet is the best feature of any helmet in the game if you play FP exclusively.
---
Nice
---
Eh, neck and neck, no, but surprisingly close. It was about 10% behind, comparing a primed BE 50cal to a primed AAE 50cal.
---
enable what it aint gonna drop on any announced dates any way
---
Wut
---
People actually rp in this game? And yes it was probably a troll.

Bethesda are penny pinchers they’re not going to pay another company for the rights to use their content.

If you get a comm ban on Xbox or PS4, it has nothing to do with Bethesda. You are using the platform chat and the report is through the Xbox or PS4 service, not Bethesda. You need to take up a false report with Microsoft or Sony.

The fuck is it then?

no i have 4300 hours ...i love this game
---
I second this
---
Its fucking fallout. What's so hard to understand about that
---
It's not that simple.  
---
There's an Excel doc going around that shows how all the armor(Non-PA) stacks up regarding matched sets, Highest DR nothing else, Highest ER, nothing else, and a mix of other needs.  
---
These revolve around the arms being the same, legs, and the chest on it's own. It also involves gear and Legendary effects. I can'r recall all but:  
---
My main has the Chemist backpack mod which erases the need for Traveling Pharmacy. Some gear has 20% reduced ammo, 20% reduced Junk weight, etc. I don't have the best protection but I can carry a lot more stuff without having to spend hours farming and grinding.  
---
it is your char so play how you want given what works and doesn't.
---
Fuck commie not does that? Shit I guess I'll just get him then
---
Preach
---
Loot drops wouldn't matter if you could use legendary modules on any weapon you could craft.
---
It’s an online game with PvP elements. What’s so hard to understand about that?
---
If you go relatively straight to the Overseer in Sutton as a lower level character (I did it at around lvl 10 after finishing Morgantown airport), she’ll say something like “omg you just left the vault? What were you doing in there for months?? Get an alarm clock!!”
---
So basically the canon reason is that you overslept a lot and were super lazy.
---
Too realistic for my liking...
---
That sucks. That really does suck
---
Probably not, they change their stances quite a bit
---
Right back at you buckaroo
---
Makes a man wish he had 2 dicks.
---
A fantasy...unrealistic....
---
Sorta like thinking John Cusack could really bag Kate Beckinsale.
---
Even in a team, I've confirmed other players do not hear your radio. At least on PC
---
Thats exactly why its so expensive bullion wise, it competes with the atom shop headware.
---
Yes, tysm!
---
Me and a bud put up a post like 4 months ago about Damage resistance for helmets
---
From 5 to a max of 25 as an example 
---
Its an interesting idea imo
---
This is real no matter how much you guys downvote it. I can beat 90% of players naked with stock weapons.
---
Not all those high level players are legitimately earned
---
ORPG?
---
Yeah I didn’t want to go into a whole speech about the differences, I was just generalizing in terms of damage. Of course there are other positives and negatives
---
Happened to me yesterday. I got trapped between the rocks and the wall somehow. So I was standing on a platform but couldn’t move anywhere. Weird and frustrating.
---
If you bite it and I get sick, it’s cursed.
---
This sounds like a Sony thing since Bethesda can’t comm ban anyone.
---
If you're going for elder runs, which is where the real rewards are at, you don't really have time to loot any of the enemies you kill. The timer stops after you finish but half the enemies will likely despawn by then
---
Yeah I'd love a new skin for my machete, something like the rusty ass katana thats used for the shish
---
Sometimes I set up my shop in survival servers. And I went to others as well. This was after they made camps (and their turrets that shot at you) indestructible tho without you being aggroed to the owner. 
---
It was fun. Never knew if the owner or another customer was around so you had to be sneaky.
---
I'd be satisfied with a gold press in vault 79. :|
---
(Projecting Kanye West) Yo Phobos, I’m really happy for you, I’ll let you finish, but Fallout New Vegas is one of the best videos games of all time. One of the best videos games of all time! :-)
---
It’s purposefully ambiguous. If you make a new character there’s a tiny bit of dialogue at the end of the overseers message goodbye in the vault saying “message will repeat in 24 hours” and it sounds all glitchy. There was probably a similar malfunction with the vault not cutting off oxygen. One of the mr handys said the only reason you’re leaving now instead of a year ago is because the food finally ran out.
---
It's only better for DPS in sustained fights. Honestly, some of my best damage with shotguns has come from a quad fire rate combat shotgun though. At that point, you can keep spamming or days. It would be nice to turn into an auto shotgun but the automatic receivers are fucking garbage in this game. You give up like a third of your damage for 10% additional fire rate, which is barely even noticeable. I was expecting something rivaling an AA-12 and got what felt like a level 30 variant of the normal one
---
You are but it’s not worth buying at all
---
That's a niche of meta builds who just want to fight each other more than anything. The removal of team PvP is what has sent these kinds of players after randoms.
---
Go to the schools and search around for the labs. Hella microscopes
---
76 is essentially just better graphics and more buggy FO4
---
There is more than Bloodied and Junkies.
---
......so much for the hepatic joke
---
RPG, no. It's not even close. Fallout 4 hands down is a better RPG. 
---
As a game though... could go either way depending.
---
Well yeah, if you repurposed it as a RPG, fixed up its issues, and rebranded it as a single player game, it would make a good RPG...but that can apply to pretty much anything
---
For the most part, but super duper only procs to the amount before the legendary perk :(.
---
Until the Year Three update when they do a lore reveal that all new players overslept by two years or have been living off cannibalising Raiders.
---
But I guess some malfunction makes sense.
---
Indeed.
---
I remember the good old days of my level 15 instigating handmade. That tore through motherfuckers.
---
Didn't know psn is just as harsh as xbl on communication in voice chat and text chat. On xbox they give comms ban for cussing at people in text messages so no one texts cuss words. Only sentences without cuss words or just straight up us emojis only. Do it multiple times increases the comms ban until its a perma ban from xbl entirely.
---
I think itd be dope if we had a bunch. A plain guitar, a broken snare drum, a bass filled with trash
---
I visited one C.A.M.P that I adored.  Didn't even think about taking photos, but I will from this moment forward. Thankfully, I remember the player's name. 
---
Dear Nuclear_Pothead_
---
Your place was amazing, 
---
Your DJ skills flame,
---
Please be advised I keep an eye out for ya in game!
---
Same here I want multiple camp locations but I would have to re build my entire camp for it to work
---
Doesn’t drop you into a marriage and give you a kid you don’t care about immediately so it has that going for it
---
They shouldn't tho.
---
One person's light trolling is another person's justification for banning you. Seems like it was warranted given that you were actually banned.
---
I miss it. 😔
---
You're overthinking it. This is not that kind of game.
---
Absolutely not. You have zero actual interaction with the world- how is it an RPG? It’s a shooter with a story.
---
If my prices are low it's because I'm trying to clear my stash. I'd be delighted if you take everything in one swoop.
---
Yup. Several times.
---
Longest one was a 10 month break because there was no content and an insane amount of bugs and instability back then.
---
No point sticking to a game when it has no worthwhile content for you and what you like.
---
I want a bat fight, Will Ferrel style.
---
It's a role-playing game.
---
Of course you have interaction with the world, even if it is watered down from FO4.
---
I haven't played so much - only level 80 - and I haven't finished the Wastelanders story. But I've already seen certain aspects that make it better than FO4.
---
I'll have to see how they act towards people like Gail and Lou. If they're like Arthur, they're dead. Roger Maxson didn't sound *that* bad on the recordings, but I'm really not very excited about militaristic, technology worshipping fanatics and personality cultists coming here, confiscating everything they think is valuable and hoarding it forever. Given their general attitude towards Raiders, I almost expect them to be hostile towards Crater - if only to get their greedy hands on Wren's comm equipment.
---
If there's an opportunity to hurt them, I'll take it.
---
I think it’s a valid question so why not explore it? Other people had credible information to add so why not.
---
Has it really reached this point? There is so much interesting lore and cool aspects to 76's story, I don't like to disregard it as a broken mess of retcons than can solely be enjoyed from a theme park perspective - like some of the fans seem to.
---
100% yes
---
It's a duper that was dumping their unwanted stuff. To you it was a generous offer from a kind soul. To that person, you were the equivalent of one of those charity stores that you dump your unwanted shit onto.
---
Still, doesn't take away from the community being awesome :)
---
I never understood why you still wore the backpack when you enter the armour and it did nothing
---
I like the biomes. I really like the systems design (stats and builds and stuff, which is a hallmark of RPGs.) Some of the quests are pretty good but nowhere near as open in terms of choice as other Fallouts, particularly FO3. There was a little bit of choice introduced with Wastelanders, you could pick settler or raider, or Wayward/Free Radical, but for the most part there's only one way to complete all of the quests so role playing is nowhere near as interesting.
---
If I'm remembering right FO4's dialog options boiled down to "yes", "yes, but I'm going to be rude about it", and "no, but I'll probably come back and say yes later when I run out of other quests to do", so if we're comparing FO76 only to FO4 I think Wastelanders made some improvements with the speech checks.
---
The explosive effect of the gauss doesn't proc Enforcer right now, only direct hits with the pellets do
---
Yup. I never used the collectrons before but I got commie and I use to be like you hunting for tick blood and then I got that and had so many blood packs it was so easy. I mean I could easily craft 70 stims in one shot with super duper maxed and chemist
---
I dont think damage maters, i have a level 35 two shot with the crystaline barrel mod. 1.5 mags and shes in slow motion.  The debuff adds up per hit as far as i know
---
I count 3 mouf holes😋
---
I was honestly expecting that skin to be for the Tenderizer when I first saw it. They're both blunt objects with lots of little things sticking out.
---
Do you tell little kids that Santa is their dad? Just wondering.
---
It's not that they're not trying to defend you, but they do jack shit to anyone with a half decent build.
---
Instead of favoriting an item  which is of limited use, we need an option to tag an item as protected ... ANY ITEM. That includes our favorite legendary items or a modded underarmor or some random piece of junk we want to display and will inevitably scrap. Skinning an item with an Atomic Shop paint job should automatically set the item as protected. And protected items should only be able to be offloaded into your stash box.
---
I have had all shotguns, all types and combos. And the best shotgun, because of how the game works TODAY, is a magic shotgun of whatever type, which unfortunately only works in VATS. 
---
Tomorrow, who knows. My mules have tons of dream shotguns, but my main carries a bloodied limb damage combat shotgun because fuck those wendigos. Also, it is bugged and it can hold 500 shells. Endless shots. 
---
The double barrel is a pain in the butt because lots of enemies usually means getting staggered and interrupted while reloading, which can get annoying and frustrating. Pump looks good and can be silenced, combat can have armor penetration.
---
So, that.
---
They won't be happy until PvP is entirely removed from the game.
---
I miss the good old days of slap damage.
---
Thanks.
---
Is there any source to this? That their coding limits the stash and inventory sizes.. any official statements?
---
I've heard people say "dump all your notes or your framerate will suck" but I personally couldn't verify this as I noticed no difference. I have noticed laggy menus but so far that has been the entire server lagging.
---
With fo1st's stashbox being one of its driving benefits I really can't help but to think our inventories are limited just because of technical reasons. Especially with inventories/stashes being *so limited*.. we're not playing on 56k modems here. 
---
Occam's razor and everything.
---
Yea but do you really give a shit about the overseer? I get where you're coming from but, I would hunt for the killer of my spouse before I would hunt for some old lady.
---
What I mean is that Bethesda isn't the kind of company that really cares about the adherence to lore. You should have a chat with some hardcore Fallout lore nerds. A good chunk of them gave up on this game even before launch because of all the lore issues and retcons.
---
I'm not saying that there isn't cool lore here or there or things can't be retconned but looking for a justification for why people are leaving the vault so late from the kind of company Bethesda is just seems like a fool's errand.
---
What would you expect them to say? Oops, the vault systems malfunctioned. Come on dude, it's Bethesda. It's not going to be a cool answer. It'd be something quick and hacky and probably will not be consistent with the universe's lore; just like how they approach everything else with this game.
---
Workshops are the last remaining PvP zones in the game.
---
Before Bethesda started catering to foodbuilds, this game was a lot more challenging and fun to play. Slap damage, team PvP, etc. Now everyone is whining and trying to make the wasteland a safe space by removing PvP, therefore nerfing the core aspects of a *survival* game.
---
Yeahp. The ally gave me a Bloodied Explosive minigun today. Kindness pays off.
---
You did have a choice in the matter.
---
You took a workshop.
---
Workshops are PvP zones.
---
Therefore, you chose to open yourself up to PvP.
---
Welp, hate to say you're probably right.
---
Wait what...........
---
Survival mode. 
---
Team PvP.
---
This game actually feeling like a survival game again and not a watered down sims apocalypse-lite game.
---
Not always, I once picked a lock at a workshop once without realizing it was owned. It was a safe, so it wasn't even something a player had to have put down and locked.
---
&gt; Do you tell little kids that Santa is their dad? Just wondering. 
---
Oof. So sexist. Could also be their mother... smh
---
I've played three times since patch 20. Was a daily player prior to that mess.
---
Check your armor. If a piece has the "reduced damage while blocking" effect, some weapons go crazy and do Insane damage.
---
Now that there are npcs in 76 any future project with the same codebase can have them easily. Beth would be foolish not to use 76 engine for mainline tes and fallout games going forward.
---
😂😂😂
---
Newish player and totally feel you on this. Saved up enough bouillon to get a new secret service armor plan, craft 5 and don't get anything decent and realize shit I'm encumbered. My stash is full, no more budget for legendary exchange today, and vendor at station is low on caps.
---
Threw my hands up and logged off.
---
I love this idea seeing how if you go down to the basement, you can see mole miners moving around.
---
Omg. Amazing. 🤣🤣🤣
---
Yeah, that’s why we should have spending limits instead of scrip limits. The current system is preventing people from playing the damn game when they want.
---
No.
---
It's been the only game I've really played since I got it. Took a month break for borderlands 3 but came right back. Have only seen 1 player level 1000+ though. And a few from 500-900. I am 387 myself at 1.3k hours in, mainly in 1 char
---
Uny agility
---
Shoehorning you into a premade character role instead of giving you the freedom of a creating your own character with imagined motives. I prefer the NV approach of a clean-ish slate and Bethesda seem to have Father issues.
---
There were also some xp exploits when this came out that allowed people to level quickly. Something about disarming and rearming traps over and over again very quickly. Possible some of these really high levels did it that way though I'm sure some really dedicated players got that high through normal gameplay. Have a friend who is 525 and she just loves the game. There are so many different ways to play the game, ways to build your character, things to find, challenges both in the game and ones you can give yourself, that make this game easy to spend a huge amount of hours playing.
---
You're no fun.
---
I once got a comm ban for asking, "Is gay a bad word?" cuz someone had hit enter to spell it out or something. 
---
That's pretty phobic on Microsoft's part if you ask me.
---
My favourite set is a full unyielding Marine set, but I love the looks you get from sturdy leather and sturdy combat armor. 
---
SS looks silly, but it has the best numbers and a jetpack. 
---
For PvP, heavy combat assassin's feels nice.
---
No.  The perk doesn't work.
---
But I'm super imposed into having a spouse in the first place.
---
For 76, all you know is there is an overseer. Kinda like how in NV all you know is Benny shot you, and a chip is related in some way, all we know is the Overseer left, and she's just somewhere outside.
---
Reclaiming isn't even a main priority, if my memory servers correct. You can just shit around.
---
I hate a lot of things about 76 but I still feel like even without NPC's the story was more engaging than FO4's main questline.
---
Is the difference the number of players in a server?
---
I've been doing the "kill x amount if robots with x weapon" at whitesprings lately, very fun having a hoard of robots surrounded me as I'm trying to punch them all in the face. If I'm going down I'm going down punching goddamnit
---
Might not have been a duper. I do this from time to time when I get a lot of plans/ammo I won't use/etc. and I'm certainly not a duper. Plus if I am almost max caps, I will go to a randoms vendor and buy all kinds of stuff. Don't always expect the worst. Also that booze and nades were probably from material turn ins for the BoS. I usually drop that in front of the turn in boxes
---
I took a workshop because I need materials...
---
of an RPG.
---
Fallout 76 lacks many of the features that would classify it as an MMORPG, imo. It's more of an action-adventure online RPG.
---
And by doing so, knowingly opened yourself up to PvP.
---
In a series of single player RPGs.
---
Why can't I play it like a single player if I choose to?
---
I suppose you are a sneak rifleman.
---
Maybe because your opponent had been approaching you and finally reached within your weapon range. Damage will be greatly halved if target is out of range.
---
Which is shitty
---
Tranquility Lane type simulation?
---
I'd play the date night holo on loudspeakers just to troll ppl who come to my vendor for junk legendary weapon script, lol
---
&gt; Might not have been a duper. I do this from time to time when I get a lot of plans/ammo I won't use/etc. 
---
...and alcohol and grenades? You know, the other things you get a surplus of when you open a ton of christmas presents.
---
Come on dude. Who are you kidding. You and I both know it's very likely a duper.
---
I took a 6 month break after the TSE and Shotgun nerfs.  Still have a 478, a 457, a 358 and a 180.  All legit, no funny business.  So 1K is certainly doable even with a long break.  Anything much above that is sketchy IMO.
---
Or at least an arcade machine type thing for the holo games we can put in too
---
Because that's not how this particular Fallout game is set up.
---
It's a nice cope for all the diehard fans who are buttblasted over the lore changes. Imagine it's an Anchorage-like simulation for Vault-Tec university students.
---
Personally I think the RPG quality rating for the fallout games should be taken on a case by case basis. I still feel 76 is too early on in its infancy to accurately make a final say on anything. For example ESO was shit for quite awhile before things properly evolved into what it is today. FO4 has more npc interactions, preplanned story lines, and mod support backing it while 76s strongest, and arguably best, advantage is the player base community itself. 76 will eventually evolve into something resembling a more traditional Fallout game as the years progress.
---
TL;DR- FO4 is currently a better Fallout game, but 76 is a better RPG due to multiplayer basis.
---
Yeah best one I got from them. Like I said best one before was a 3 star bloodied cyro but here lately it’s been one star crap. But tonight was a hell of a night when I got a fixer from purveyor and also actually got a one star fixer from uranium fever also and then this. Too bad during the nuke I launched to queen she didn’t drop anything good and we fought baby earl in the grove and also nothing good. But I’ll take today as a win
---
I have one in my vendor if you’re on ps4. Been trying to get rid of it forever lol. You can have it on the house.
---
Not close, and Fallout 4 is a better RPG than it gets credit for.
---
My mind doesn't jump to worst case. Could have been either. I'm just saying that I do this from time to time and I'm not a duper so I'm not going to instantly think this person is either. LOL you people really pride yourselves on down voting things that go against your opinions.
---
Think about it. Energy weapons literally ionise and send a bolt of energy, which will be more taxing on the required parts than just making some gunpowder deflagrate to propel a small metal projectile.
---
You hear the whispering too? My friend that I play with says he doesn't hear it. I always hear it and it creeps me out. I love the Bog but never stick around for too long. It's such a perfectly eerie place.
---
Would you say the same if Fallout 4 didn't have mod support?
---
I'm comparing vanilla FO4 to post-launch FO76 Wastelanders.
---
Which is still within game parameters.
---
Yes.
---
Good to see Bethesda isn't afraid to alienate their entire fanbase then...
---
The game is great when I'm not interacting with other people. I shouldn't have to pay extra for the privilege of not having to...
---
But vanilla FO4 is trash lol
---
Someone mentioned before that travelling caps cost will be doubled. If true, it is really a nice adjustment.  :(
---
Yes, please free me from this hell.
---
Legendary 1911?  are you talking about honest Hearts?
---
Wait so I'm not the only one who hears those whispers thank god thought I was losing it
---
I just don't like sneaking.
---
I only stopped for Sekiro....
---
Quad/33 or FFR/ 25vats or 15 reload
---
Theres also several different hacked cryos around
---
Or camp of the week people submit their camps and the best one every week is put as like a blueprint in your camp
---
No. not even close. but i like the step they took in wastelanders to build that up.
---
I'll check.  
---
I'm going to take pictures of each piece of gear to see how bad these changes are going to be. They are in effect broken but considering BGS is that against the ToS? That makes no sense if they aren't fixing problems.
---
I don't understand how people are saying F4 is a better RPG than 76 when it forces a backstory on your character and railroads you into being a good guy/girl for the main story.
---
76 you're just a random vault dweller with whatever backstory you decide to make up...you can join the raiders or settlers...or you can remain in between. There are so many possibilities for backstories with your characters.
---
Sure, F4 had more joinable factions (though really, does it?) but come on, 76 is clearly the better RPG.
---
I just see the evidence as presented. If they got those specifics things and those specific things only in the volumes alluded to, the conclusion is self evident. You would have to be wilfully ignorant to think otherwise.
---
If I see something that looks like a cat and purrs like a cat, I don't immediately jump to the conclusion that it's a panther.
---
But that's just me. You do you.
---
There are a lot of comments here, I'm sure someone questioned why you don't just seek revenge.
---
Six-string samurai!
---
It may outclass it number wise but power armour users should be using dodgy which puts them at ~60% damage resistance BEFORE damage resist numbers are applied, couple that with emergency protocols and you're looking at ~80%. I promise you arent more tanky than a good PA setup.
---
Of course there is. But you can rank effects based on their... effectiveness.
---
Everyone downvoting this, link your modlists.
---
Tell me you could do a playthrough without.
---
Unless you mean you should be able to hunt then down when they flee with it. That would be dope.
---
I just wish the little black park slid down when you pulled out your weapon simular to the assaultron helment
---
Daily Ops quest giver. :)
---
You arent using calibrated shocks are you
---
If ya accidentally scrap it, let me know, and I'll make ya another one! Enjoy it! I know I do around Halloween!
---
I like to think the 24 hour shutdown was just Vault-Tec bullshit and some dwellers hung around to see what would happen and when the vault didn't lose power they said fuck it, let's just stay home xD
---
What actual interaction do you have? What actual choices do you make? What impact do you have on the world based on a *choice* that you made?
---
At best, you choose the name of an inoculation soda that is never mentioned again.
---
Again, it’s a shooter with a story. You don’t make any choices that can change that story.
---
I honestly want a stash box there first
---
Care to show examples of world interaction? Other than the nukes of course.
---
If not properly prepared, it can be a fairly dangerous area. What system you on?
---
I get it now. You meant when dying from PvE stuff and someone just scoops it. lol Even better.
---
It would be fun to see them dancing around down there in the background while the DJ is playing some music.
---
Or someone who donated large quantities of materials to Atlas, opened their provisions, and decided to give them to someone else.
---
Use Fed76 to determine worth. I use it for everything
---
World interaction means manipulating the worldspace?
---
Damage numbers are super inaccurate. They don't account for damage mitigation in SPECIAL or armor perks. He also could have just been out healing your shots.
---
Oh is that what those weird distant sirens are? They're meant to be BoS things?
---
Statement comparing the BoS to Raiders, followed by a wish for an Enclave dlc.
---
You know the Enclave are the biggest villains in the game, right? Y'all just hoping for a black leather trench coat to go with your Enclave uniforms?
---
Because it isn’t single player. Jesus you are dense. 
---
Hey, I just bought this Vanilla Coke, and I don’t like that it doesn’t taste like regular Coke. They’re both Coke, why aren’t they the same? I want them to be the same. 
---
*they arent*. And that is obvious before you buy the game.
---
Never heard of Fed76 thank you!
---
Every individual roll is rare with how many possibilities there are. Valuable is another question though. But a medic's fat man is pretty pointless as a weapon, so its rarity does not mean much here
---
Ooooh. That too unfortunately. Get a railway rifle to VATs wanted players.
---
Yeah a character with zero narrative connection is super cool. Plus the lazy amnesia  route is good writing yo cus we write it ourselves instead of them writng it it, lack of writing = good writing isn't my mind.
---
Lets totally ignore the fact that literally every fallout game has given you a premade backstory. FO1 the vault dweller, FO2 the tribal, FO3 another vault dweller.  NV the best courier in the region and area depended on you and you accidentally set off a nuke, and NV fanboys somehow defend the game as having the least backstory when in fact it obectivly has the most. FO4 you're vault dweller who wakes upe 200 years after the bombs. Looking for your son and discovering the new world.
---
Preset characters are ok if you can make them your own.
---
Meanwhile I'm sitting here watching the world spin around
---
I'd scrip it.
---
A preset backstory is different to having a preset character. You are literally Nate or Nora in Fallout 4. Their pre-war professions are set in stone and you have no room for imagination. FO3/NV differ in this regard.
---
The voice acting for the Sole Survivor is the killer, honestly.
---
I'm here with 291
---
lol Keyword: were
---
Wait there’s a damage cap now?
---
And yet it should have the option to. Vanilla coke is still mostly coke. Its coke with vanilla in it, not an entirely different beverage.
---
I am lvl 312 and I use the exact same handmade on my sneak build it's good for taking out single enemy's an alo no nad for taking out hords pretty decent gun at my lvl an for end game
---
You realize there are entire groups of players that just want to fight each other in the most overpowered ways possible cuz it is unique gameplay and fun for us, right? 
---
Sorry it isn't fun for you, no one is forcing your participation.
---
There is a solo mode. For PS4, when you're on the main menu for Adventure, Private or Nuclear Winter, before you select NW, press square to turn teams off
---
Awesome idea, I’m the same as a lot of people and want build styles that suit the area, and I want to rebuild so I can use things I’ve got in the atom shop along the way but don’t want to lose my current camp.
---
Not to mention it would fix when you log into a world and it can’t spawn your camp in it, so you click find another world and get the same world.
---
Why are you asking me if you brought up the concept in the first place.
---
perhaps. but we as consumers are within our right to complain about bs.
---
nothing wrong with that, specially considering that what Bethesda is doing falls squarely within this category.
---
Because it seems like you're saying that. There is plenty of interaction with the world, that is one the games core features. What you're talking about is manipulation of worldspaces as a consequence of player choice.
---
Appalachia didn't take any direct hits from nukes. Simple as that. Yeah, nukes hit (as evidenced in the trailers) but nothing like what hit DC or the Commonwealth.
---
You could play the ['New Meat'](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/New_meat) from Toxic Larry's and ['Issac's Message to The Sloth'](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Isaac%27s_message_to_the_Sloth) holo to mess with people also.
---
I'd play 'The Chosen' holo from Lucky Hole Mine, too because that guy makes me laugh every time, "Let it be known, in this world, the Interloper has chosen JEFF LANE..!!"
---
Awesome! Good to clear my conscience lol i felt like i was scamming them or something
---
This would be amazeballs. Building is my favorite part of the game and not having to stress over "but I'll never get it back" would rock. And would definitely entice me to get more items. (i.e. Maybe I have a contemporary farmhouse for my current CAMP. Raiders items, while cool, just do not fit the "look" for that CAMP so I don't bother getting them.)
---
They’re the same sound as the sonic emitter at line in the sand so I’m assuming they are
---
I actually know a bit about guns, and I don’t think this would work. In operation, they are just like any other suppressor but have a bit more space for the exit of the spread of pellets. However the the bore diameter of rifle barrels in a given caliber are usually consistent to within a half a thousandth of an inch or so, but shotgun bores in a particular gauge may vary as much as .02 inches or more. So shotgun barrels are objectively bigger than (most) rifle barrels, and therefore the threads on the shotgun suppressor would need to be larger than that of the rifle suppressor. SO, you most likely would not be able to fit a shotgun suppressor on a rifle, and vise versa.   
---
TLDR; you most likely would not be able to fit a shotgun suppressor on a rifle, and if you could, and we’re able to fire it, it would probably break the gun.
---
Lag can make it feel like a 1 shot. It wasn't a 1 shot.
---
imagine getting downvoted for being right. lmao 
---
people on this sub think that every time someone dumps literal garbage on the ground its evidence of pure unadulterated altruism. its just fuckin dupers and atlas garbage and people burning caps, they dont give a fuck about you, you dont need to make a circlejerk post about it.
---
No individual weapon is getting nerfed. Only stacking buffs are affected. If you're a bloodied build, chances are you're stacking a lot of buffs so you will have the most noticeable change
---
You can, but I also have a right to comment on how pointless it is. I'd rather save space for things that actually have a chance of being carried out at some point
---
Yes, I believe a Bethesda community manager confirmed that legendary perks are included for patch 22
---
Yes they're coming.
---
There is a way to enter the game solo, however there’s not a designated “solo mode.” On Xbox at least, you can turn off the fill team option and go in solo, but I think it’s always better to just go in with teams, as that’s 3 less people trying to kill me. A solo mode would be a welcome addition to me also.
---
It just works!
---
this game isnt really an RPG beyond head cannon and player RP. there arent any real choices that matter.
---
this game is a looter shooter with extra steps.
---
For the sake of it I just ran a brief test against the same Mirelurk queen, lvl 50, vats, all magic weapons, 4 uny armor pieces and nerd rage barely active.
---
A Junkie Gauss (with 5 addictions) oneshot her, plain and simple. No need to charge it either, but it always miss the first shot and that's a big negative.
---
A Bloodied Combat with perforating magazine can 2 shot her, but usually ends up using 3 shots.
---
A Quad Explosive Double Barrel with demolition expert rank 2 can 3 shot her, but usually ends up using 4 shots.
---
I assume a Bloodied Explosive Double Barrel would be better per shot than the Combat, but it would be annoying to use.
---
Just a brief test eh, I could be wrong. 😊
---
You are just trying to justify your opinion. Like I've said a couple times before, I have done this exact thing and I wouldn't think of duping an item(s). So in your gibberish that you are trying so hard to make convincing, I'm a duper as well because of your so called "evidence." Maybe you have had a bad experience that has made you doubt every kind deed but I have not and will not ever jump to conclusions like you. Peace....out
---
So correct me if I’m missing something but I haven’t seen any hint of the enclave in 76 (I would guess mainly because it’s based a few years after the war) the BoS is just starting to be added back.
---
Unfortunately Fatmans and missile launchers in 76 were hit with a pretty serious nerf almost immediately that made them basically useless as weapons. And anything with the medic’s role garbage unless it’s a flamer with the friendly fire perk. You probably won’t get any more for it than its scrip value, sorry.
---
3 toons, 1000 scrip each, one or two really good weapons for each. Got some half decent stuff that has been selling really well in my vendors and the really good stuff I'm saving for trade even though I never trade lol best roll...be50 handmade. Never even tried bloody but guess who has a bloody commando toon now?
---
And while I’m BoS all day, I really do like Enclave power armor.
---
Still not worth the trade off of carry weight reductions and legendary effects of my armour
---
Physics being run client side is usually the case for most games tho
---
yea its absolutely better
---
It's because the close location of those could result it an exploit due to lag. This is what happened with the caps for legendaries at the purveyor.
---
Someone contesting a workshop is not griefing. 🤦‍♀️🥴
---
Two major problems with your statement. 
---
1: clearly you dont understand how inflation works
---
2: the game would have to have sort sort of limit, no matter how high it is. There for people would be trading at that limit for the rare items. The higher the limit the longer it would take for new players to to get decent weaponry.
---
Think about it dispassionately, would you really go back to that era of gaming if you could? 
---
Before the days of being able to download patches, we got complete bug free games. 
---
Before the days of being able to download purchases, we got complete games that let you earn everything via skill and time. 
---
Before the days of being able to play online, games rarely ever had more than 100 hours worth of content. 
---
You'd play the standalone game, unlock everything and then be done. Didn't matter if you still wanted to play, there was no content left for you to explore. Imagine spending 3 months playing Mario daily.
---
We get *more* titles under the old model. We get complete titles and then the studio quickly moves onto the sequel, or the next game because that was the only way they'd make more cash. 
---
We get *less* titles under the new model, but what we do get is fleshed out to be well over 1000 hours worth of content, with more to follow. This incentivizes studios to spend time adding to a specific game, instead of creating new ones. 
---
I'm 100% on the fence. I'm 40 years old, so I cut my teeth on an 8-bit NES, I'm well versed in both styles of business but still I can't decide which I'd prefer. 
---
We'd be on GTA 9 by now, had the old model survived. But GTA 5, 6,7, 8 wouldn't have had half as much content as a result. 
---
We'd be on Fallout 7, but each one would be about 80 hours worth of content max, then you'd be forced to replay the same stuff over and over or move on to the next game. 
---
With the new model, you find a game you like and you never leave. You can spend literal years playing and experiencing new content. I've got 1000 hours in 76 and still haven't seen everything. 
---
We're spoiled by this. We're so accustomed to having fully fleshed out worlds that continue to get updated, with literally hundreds of hours worth of content, for the same entry fee as the old model, that we demand more and more for less and less. 
---
I don't know which model I prefer as both have pros and cons. Which would you choose?
---
the wendigos get the plasma hose, and so do you, degenerate cannibal
---
No because the trade side of things was no where near as big a part of the game as it is now.
---
If Bethesda was smart they would realize excess wasted scrip is an opportunity. But instead the lazy pricks say "Screw it. Set a limit and let them complain" I've seen tons of ideas to deal with the scrip limit. The laziness and missed opportunity is astounding with this company. But I guess they are too busy pushing out buggy atom shop items that don't work. 76 is after all a cash grab. Nothing to take pride in.
---
Thanks 😉
---
Yea but what about a flamer? A flamer is just a fuel tank with a wick at the end?  That should break hella slowly
---
Might help the mood...
---
https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=tQdMXtxjbkg&amp;list=RDAMVMtQdMXtxjbkg
---
I’m on PC. I definitely went in prepared lol
---
That explains why we get so many missiles and mini nukes as quest rewards lol
---
Be interesting to see how many years they keep it going. I'd assume they'd have fallout 5 at that time and nuke 76. Why throw us a bone when they want more money and I'm sure a ton of micro transactions. It will be up to people in the community to make it possible to play this solo. And when they do it will be a polished gem filled with incredible mods to make it an amazing game.
---
I'm happy today.
---
Forgot all about those. I might keep a few in my inventory from now on
---
Foundation, stairs that include the strip of floor on outside of house to the left, first floor of house to right, second floor built on top of first floor. I have a ledge wrapping around the second floor on the outside with turrets.
---
I can't connect another set of stairs on top of the existing set and I can't build the other type of stairs on the ledge on my second floor.
---
Everyone is on their alts at the moment. If you are on Xbox post on the LFG.
---
 YESSssssss.  This is my favorite pistol...
---
Haha lol
---
Had almost the same shit happen to me the other day. I had unintentionally started the event while doing the side quest Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing. I had only seen the event once before and have been trying to get the Fixer plan forever. Literally as soon as the event starts my game crashes. Bye bye Encryptid.
---
that's just as pointless considering Bethesda does what Bethesda wants. they listen to what, 1% of all feedback? and it's usually when posted in their own forums. they even ignore bug reports.
---
like you yourself said, it all goes straight to the void.
---
Now is a good time to shop around different player vendors. Everyone is overloaded with 3 star weapons and I’ve seen some decent deals in the 5-15k range. May have to server hop a few times, and you won’t get a god roll, but I’ve seen some nice weapons on PS4.
---
If you’re on PS4 I have a really anticlimactic 25FFR Gatling plasma that I got the other day. It seems like it would be a great role but it eats through cores like nothing else and I keep getting hit with basically every ammo glitch there is with the thing. Cores randomly eject when there is still hundreds of shots left. Batteries included perk not working right. That kind of stuff. Maybe it will work better for you.
---
They aren’t really dead, they are just pretending, they seen you and how much of a badass you are and got scared so they are pretending to be dead lol
---
I found a bss15 sword today for 800 caps. And at 400 each a bunch of unyielding sentinel armor. I feel bad I bought it all
---
I found one in red rocket near  [The Giant Teapot](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Giant_Teapot) . Don't know whether it's a random respawn point.
---
They just don’t want to be their hard earned (duped) weapons to no longer be the top of the meta
---
Ooo wee!
---
if you want to be tanky as a bloodied build then PA is required. mod the torso with emergency protocols and you're good to go.
---
other than that, pick a weapon class and max its perks. nerd rage, bloody mess. and don't forget the adrenal reaction mutation. dodgy helps you stay alive.
---
I usually wait until after a SBQ event so I can see if there are enough people to do it.
---
PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!
---
what platform?
---
Maybe one of the only things Bethesda did right. Not fond of tanagra and I have not really explored the bog too much, especially some of the towns
---
Please Bethesda. I want to build other camp designs but don’t want to tear down my current camp since i really like it.
---
I have one CAMP midway on a sheer cliff ledge overlooking Watoga. No resources there, but the view of SBQ event nukes is a fantastic.  Nothing ever spawns on that ledge.  The worst I got was scorched taking pot shots at the camp from the ledge above doing little to no damage. There is no way to get there except fast travel (or dropping from the ledge above).
---
True that. Found a B Limb damg +1 AGL Pump Action in somebody's vendor for only 300 caps.
---
Things are certainly priced to move right now.
---
Stopped for borderlands 3 but that was even more of a mess with constant nerfs so came back after a few months, got about 1400 hours in now
---
Im on Xbox and I havnt had those problems, I’d say uninstall and reinstall but it might be an issue with your xbox or internet
---
Ps4
---
You can interact with the world in games like Half-Life, Yakuza or Grand Theft Auto and those are not RPGs. What makes RPGs special in this regard is that your actions affect how the world behaves through player choice: dropping barrels of radioactive waste in Cottonwood Cove (New Vegas), unleashing feral ghouls in Tenpenny Tower (Fallout 3) or joining any faction other than the Institute (Fallout 4), these choices permanently lock the player from doing faction quests in their respective locations. 
---
You can´t find any of that in Fallout 76 because the game railroads you in joining every faction in the game without player choice and zero manipulation of world spaces (the world stays the same), and even in Wastelanders it doesn't matter which faction you choose to do the final mission because eventually you will be grinding reputation for both factions regardless, gaining the same rewards without penalties. FO76 is a bare-bones RPG only because you can allocate a maximum amount of SPECIAL points in your character which the illusion of character builds, illusion because even that is not permanent since you can move points above level 50.
---
You don’t need power armor if you’re setup is dialed in. It’s different, but you can take a hell of a beating outside of power armor if you know what you’re doing. Power armor is king for heavies, but any other weapon I wouldn’t bother TBH. PA handicaps every other build IMO.
---
Eww.....
---
Saw a BE max level LMG in a player vendor once for 20K. Only had 6k at the time so missed out. Something you don't forget easily.
---
~~It is said that scrapping a card only gives 2 points/rank, and that 10 points cost 800 atom.~~
---
~~Leveling one perk to rank 4 needs 450 points, and it is said that they are considering lowing the amount.~~
---
Wrong and obsolete, sorry.
---
This is probably unrelated but is FO76 coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X? I plan on upgrading to next gen but I personally would love to see this game continue onto next gen and continue improving. I’d hate to see support for it stop soon after the next gen consoles come out.
---
Thats not fair cause I bet yoire a commando with no need for most PA benefits. Stabilized and EProtocols are a heavy gunners bread and butter
---
Mind, I'm finding this when I'm just moving things around camp. Pick up electron unit, drop it at new location. Change mind, take it back.
---
Item not supported....
---
Well fuck me I guess?
---
I know when I was I'm your shoes I hoped so Mich that they would, the bit that annoyed me was like 75 of the people who pay for 1st said they would still keep paying even if the tent was free. 
---
Alternatively they could just charge £2 a month or £15 a year for the box as it is going to make them a lot more money that way.
---
if I'm not sneaking, this is generally my experience outside of PA: https://streamable.com/svtgyn
---
Bless ye, those diffusers are not findable early on.
---
It’s one of only a few viable options for pvp, none of which require aiming.
---
*loads BE handmade with cannibalistic intent*
---
Big true.
---
You just shouldnt be able to drop any item in the favorite wheel... Period
---
If you are on ps4 and give me mats i can craft enough for you to deconstuct until you learn the plan 👍
---
You have a point. But then again they shouldn’t be able to fire explosive rounds.
---
So what do you prefer people use?
---
Because that’s not a bloodied build, not one that’ll take damage anyway.
---
Thanks I'm on PC though!
---
BuT tHeRe WiLl Be AnOtHeR eXpLoIt - the white knights on this sub.
---
I will have to check that out thanks!
---
Most MMOs have private player ran servers. 
---
Give this game enough time and I guarantee you there will be a private server.   
---
I'm sure there are people already building private servers for this game. Private player ran servers are so profitable that they're a pretty much guarantee.  
---
A lot of people would be surprised to know how simple the technology is... I hosted my own private MMO servers back in the 90s (EQ &amp; UO).
---
ah, what?
---
Jesus Fucking Christ I seriously need to explain this AGAIN.
---
Yes, exactly.  The Fallout 1st scrap box doesn't affect servers like higher stash space would.
---
The reason we have stash limits in the first place is because EVERY SINGLE TIME you look into your stash the game needs to load EVERY SINGLE UNIQUE ITEM inside from the server.  If you have a stash crammed full enough you can actually see the game lag and strain every time you look inside.
---
It all has to do with the number of unique id values the game needs to load.
---
When you're dealing with the scrap box the game only needs to load a small number of values every single time because there's only thirty something types of scrap.  That means the game ONLY needs to load the id representing each type of scrap and the variable representing how much you have of each type.
---
When you're dealing with the stash box you're dealing with MUCH MORE information which puts MUCH MORE strain on  the server because the more stash space you have the more items it's possible to cram in there and the more information needs to be relayed by the server.  A stash box doesn't just need to account for thirty something values like the scrap box, it needs to be able to handle all the values a scrap box can PLUS every single unique piece of armor and weapon you have each with additional values for their type/level/condition/legendary effects on top of all of the possible pieces of junk, misc, aid ammo and everything else humanly possible to cram into a stash.
---
Limits on stash space exist for the same reason limits on camp build budget exist, not because Betehsda is run by assholes but because if they pushed the limits any further it would start having even larger effects on the stability and performance of the game.
---
Not much, if anything because it's lvl 35.  Good for you though.
---
I especially agree with paying fallout first members having limits is completely messed up
---
idea: completely remove pvp
---
Huh. Maybe vault 76 is WHY they're all 'we need to take high tech away from these people who will definitely misuse it.'
---
It could be a good leveling weapon
---
Good for yourself since it's much better than most lv45/50 weapon without legendary effects.
---
The favourite is the locking system. We're not gonna get anything else ...
---
that's kinda my point. this game is essentially just Fo4 with some minor networking features taped on.
---
but unless you're talking about fan-made ones, I can guarantee you Bethesda will *never* allow private servers. because their entire revenue model relies on the very fact that's not an option.
---
cosmetics, time gating, etc. it all goes straight out the window if I could just boot up my own server.
---
It’s a saying. Dumbass.
---
I guess
---
This is what they should have done. Doing so would allow for things to be limitless, Caesar's Legion? Sure! Children of Atom? Why not? The Institute vs. The Enclave? Yes please!
---
By making it a simulation, you don't need to worry about canon and just focus on making it a fun game. 76 isn't the type of game you're gonna roleplay like 3, NV and 4.
---
Harper
---
if only there was a way to just throw them
---
Handmades will always have more dps, the quirks of the assault rifle are better recoil &amp; faster reload
---
A lot of privately ran servers aren't "allowed". That doesn't stop them at all lol.  
---
If FO76 does fall in to disarray and is on its death throes then there will be private ran servers popping up. I guarantee it.  
---
(OP was talking about FO76 going offline for good if you don't understand the context)
---
You’ve got 4 endurance, 11 intelligence, and cards that aren’t worth running in or out of power armor.
---
Hey now you PC gods aint that rare. 0.001% is a little low. Im thinking more like a solid 0.007%. 
---
P.S. We want your frame rate.
---
A max level Handmade has all of the same stats as a max level Assault Rifle, with all of the same mod options and everything, except it has significantly higher damage. The Handmade is just a better weapon in all situations. The gap might close a bit with scaling in One Wasteland, since the Handmade tops out at level 45 and the AR is 50, but it's highly likely that the Handmade will continue to be a better weapon.
---
Interesting. I was talking about non-magic viability, though I found a piece of blocking gear which I've heard makes any shotgun magic, was thinking of keeping it on me in case a fight against Earl goes really south.
---
Also I haven't tried a bloodied character yet, I've gotten so used to leaving bloodied out of my dps comparisons that I forgot about it. It always wins so why mention it lol. I bet a bloodied combat shotgun is up there with a quad double barrel even non-magic. I'd be hesitant to use an explosive quad though, I tend to end up point blank a lot.
---
"Planning"
---
Is he on Xbox? 
---
I can stop by and give him some mats
---
What system are you on?  If you’re on Xbox hit me up I’ll load you down with ammo.
---
I actually dropped my junkies ffr gauss minigun I was so sad 😂
---
Can I please take the Uny BoS Leg? I have a 1* and this would help.
---
yeah I'm pretty sure I get the context, yes.
---
I just don't think there's enough interest, even if the game was on its way out and the networking features are minimal. this is not exactly the sort of thing you could host on the nexus. and you most definitely can't count on Bethesda.
---
so.
---
Considering area damage to dodge, scaring skill and annoying approaching mobs, I think handmade with higher peak damge is better.
---
If your on pc theres a mod on nexus that stops you from dropping selling or scrapping your hotkeyed items and equiped items incl armour and weaps
---
Just let me build one at my camp
---
Terrible idea unless transmogs exist
---
Depends if you want raw damages or DPS.
---
Combat shotgun is the best for DPS because of reload times on both Double barrel and pump.
---
Anyway, as for shotguns, raw damages isnt the most important if you have the magic bug.
---
Do you know which one freezes quicker, quad or 2 shot?
---
They had a different voice actor for meat week this year and last year for whatever reason. Since that ended just a few weeks ago you’re probably still used to that voice.
---
my take. Fallout 4 is better RPG but i don’t feel like i’m playing as ‘myself’ 
---
whereas in 76, i feel like i’m playing as me.
---
This would help the wrong people a bit too much
---
www.project1999.com 
---
www.uooutlands.com
---
Both these MMOs are from the 90s and both these private servers make hundreds of thousands of dollars each year. Both of these servers are hosted on Amazon servers. 
---
There are about ten thousand other WoW private servers hosted throughout the world too. 
---
It is definitely possible. I wouldn't be so quick to say "nope never going to happen" especially with how easily it is to host this game. Your own words.
---
that's just something I put together to show how 'tanky' you are as a bloodied build outside PA. which is to say, you're not.
---
in that clip I also have pretty much every defensive perk available to bloodied builds, so I fail to see how it doesn't qualify as one.
---
Not to mention the range bug for combat shotgun, which synergize really wall with magic
---
Yes and its those specific quirks that make me wonder whether it will be situationally better, especially after wastelanders or during daily ops.
---
In an event where there are a ton of enemies and you might not be able to sneak, being staggered by enemies means reloads get interrupted.
---
The other thing is that, there's a lot of ammo wastage with commando. One tap, sometimes 3 bullets come out when one would do. Reloading is a constant.
---
Now, the faster reload of AR gives the advantage of reducing likelihood of being staggered, in exchange for damage per shot loss when the mag is actually full. 
---
The reason I bring this up is because I find myself using my quad commando weapons a lot in Earle, rather than bloodied or junkies. Cutting out reload results in excellent efficiency in clearing wendigo spawns, and I believe this would be true as we see more high hp enemies come into the game.
---
Assault rifles are like halfway. They might be the fastest reloading commando guns.
---
I think one way to look at it might be like this. Would you pick a perk card that gives you twice as fast reloading, or one that gives you 25-30% more damage per shot, given capacity of ammo is always maxed at 20 to 30?
---
Once the XP grind starts back up in a few days, people will be starting Encrypted plenty.
---
Yeah crazy that radiation levels can just balance out after a nuke. They abandoned the old ways.
---
I correct you. The Enclave’s here ;)
---
Because any other mmo also has limits like these and if you're trying to say otherwise you're just bullshitting?  They can find ways to hide them from you so you don't even realize they're there but they ALWAYS exist because no matter how advanced your game is there's always going  to be issues around loading information from the games server.
---
Whether it's by restricting how you can view your inventory, partitioning your inventory into smaller subsections that can only be viewed one at a time or simplifying the information that needs to be sent at any given time they ALL have to account for how much information they're sending from the server to the client and how it's going to affect performance.
---
It’s a good weapon regardless. My main has had one exactly like that for a year. It’s an absolute beast, the only problem is it has a low sale value.  Which is fine cause I wouldn’t part with it regardless, although if your build isn’t right that’s a shame
---
Would you like to revolutionize the games server infrastructure to account for your arbitrary increases in stash space then?  Because I don't know about you but I have a stash absolutely crammed to the gils thanks to my collection of 90% WR weapons and ultralight armors and the game already strains when I look inside and that's at a limit half of what you'd like them to suddenly just increase it to.
---
I never said it was impossible. just that it's unlikely, because I don't think there's enough interest and both the nexus and Bethesda frown at mods that infringe copyright. so there's even less incentive because you can't host it over at the nexus.
---
what I did say is that Bethesda themselves are never going to make that option available to us, because it goes directly against their revenue model.
---
Camp builders and the RP ppl will love this and use it properly pvp griefers and dupers will love it more
---
There are a couple more weapons which are broken currently. Not only Tesla, also all the magic ones can interrupt a players experience.
---
think about the time you have investet to launch a nuke and someone one-shots Earl?
---
Serendipity and dodgy maxed. Evasive barbarian and I think iron clad? is the other damage resist. evasive and barbarian should give you good damage resistance since they go up with your special points in their category and unyeilding will boost your stats. I’ve heard of people running a couple bolstering pieces but I’ve not tried as I’m not tanking and I’m not sure what the trade off would be loosing those two unyeilding. Ss is best but combat or heavy metal are good armour choices imo.
---
 
---
Gotta edit it I don’t know why I was thinking commando, it’s late lmao. Power armour is a good choice for heavy guns but most perks don’t effect your damage resistance in it on my bloodied pa I use emegency protocols and dodgy maxed.
---
Edit two. T65 I do believe gives you the best damage resistance but I could be wrong I use sh. And I’d suggest your primary gun that is achievable to trade for is a good .50 cal
---
Just comm for 76 I checked six siege and it’s fine
---
&gt;Died like 4-5 times
---
&gt;I definitely went in prepared lol
---
The nerve on some people
---
Something is definitely up with reload. I'll show ammo remaking and it'll be out. It'll reload and still be empty, other issues.
---
I think i might actually agree with the assault rifle being situationally better. The faster reload does not make up for lost damage however and it most likely never will.
---
It’s just area chat for 76
---
You can be tanky though, that’s just not how it’s done. DR/ER is meaningless, mitigation is what’s important. You need your HP/AP to be as high as possible so you can run low health and still have room to take damage. More AP/fast AP regen means dodgy does more work, more HP means you aren’t near death at 20% health. That build does damage, but doesn’t mitigate it. Almost everyone out of power armor does them wrong and wonders why they die constantly.
---
Probably
---
They'll most likely port the cc ones over
---
Yup we were recruiting for voluntary gulag
---
This would be interesting to know. The only other game I've really gotten into dps calculations for was Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer, and the fan-made calculator for that took reload time into account. It makes a big difference.
---
If I'm remembering right from my modding days, exact reload times are a difficult thing to datamine in Fallout because they're based on the reload animation length rather than being a number directly specified in the editor (you can specify a multiplier to speed them up or down but it's still relative to the duration of the animation.)
---
It's not expensive because it's useful, it's expensive because its a helmet and can be worn cosmetically and serve as an "I have this much bullion to throw away" symbol.
---
If they gave it special effects it would be the Free Radical mask all over again with people only wearing it or demanding that every other helmet/hat in the game get a similar treatment.
---
Definitely very situational for sure. I got an assault rifle in a trade recently and just tried it on for size. Was blown away by just how much faster the reload is and then ideas started brewing hahah.
---
I wasn’t banned just chat banned. We literally were recruiting for the gulag and dropping supplies how tf is that warranted?
---
? Lol it’s a hard fight dude, despite being prepared it is still hard.
---
I'm saying it is a guarantee, dude. There is too much easy money to be made.  
---
Look at the thousands of privately ran WoW servers if you honestly think Beth could stop it.
---
So we were recruiting for the gulag and if you joined we dropped supplies. Like that’s literally it we didn’t even pvp a single person
---
I rarely use the quad and the gauss exactly for that reason, forces me to use perks to protect myself. 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
I dont think assault rifle will end up doing more damage, but I think it might be closer than a lot of us assume.
---
You understand what I mean. If there was a way to test 5 minute or 10 minute continuous fire and reload with handmade vs assault, i think the numbers would be really interesting to know :)
---
I can give you some IGN: NiNe\_LightNinG
---
Yea sure.
---
I swear I overheard a mole miner say, "God, I need some coffee," once when I was stealthing. It would be amusing to hear what other tidbits they have to share. Maybe they could have conversations with the Blackwater Mine protectron. We'd only understand half, but that's better than almost none. Plus I like the way that guy says "Blackwater Mine."
---
I know. Its a dumb fucking saying. That is my point.
---
I call this "lottery win". As if you'd get banned for having all wallpapers pfft
---
because ***that's*** not really a bloodied build. you're not even in nerd rage range. you're just double dipping both worlds. yeah, of course you can be tanky outside PA if you're sitting at 50% health. but then again, that's not really bloodied.
---
also if memory serves, in that clip I was missing like 3 more dodgy procs. that would maybe keep me alive for a grand total of one more second. that's also a full AP/sen set you're looking at. can't get better regen and mitigation than that outside PA.
---
Is the head a limb
---
It boosts damage to the head for the purposes of crippling it, but doesn't boost your headshot damage multiplier so they won't die any faster.
---
I know that no individual thing is getting nerfed but some things are getting nerfed harder than others. Fist weapons dropped around 80 percent or something, the combat shotgun was beset half, but the light machine gun and gauss mini were around 25 or 30 from The testing videos I saw. It wasn’t equal across the board.
---
Yeah I recently remade my base and have all those exact wallpapers without buying them idk what’s happening
---
Awesome, add PEEZYPURP pls. I’ll be in shortly
---
I like the signs of their failure and appreciate their absence from the game -- shows the power of the scorched. I hope that remains. Ultimately, I want more content and hope this isn't the end.
---
Reload is definitely much faster, maybe twice as fast, on AR and as another user said, recoil may be better as well. In non vats usage this would matter more than in vats usage.
---
But I do agree handmade is better without a doubt. The point im curious about is those certain situations like we see in Earle and Daily Ops, where the differences AR offers might make life much more enjoyable :)
---
If we get a guitar backpack we’re gonna need an emote that plays a guitar too.
---
Thanks for the info. I appreciate it.
---
you can't take it with you but you can certainly die trying
---
you misinterpreted what I said. I don't think Beth can stop it, I just know they themselves won't offer a private server solution. it'd have to come from us, the fans.
---
except I don't think there's enough interest from the playerbase for a multitude of reasons. it's a smaller base compared to WoW, modders avoid copyright infringements because of the nexus culture, etc.
---
I don't know if this is going to change when the game dies. I hope it does. I hope we get private servers tomorrow so I don't have to be tethered to Beth's awful services anymore. I just don't think it's going to happen, personally.
---
By sneak critical you mean the ninja 3x damage perk card ?
---
I need your ign 'cause the friend system suuuuucks
---
Mods ive found dual bars, flaming
---
This is a true statement
---
Just timing the reload animations with a timer would give you enough information to do the math. The time it takes to empty a clip can be figured out from the rate of fire numbers on [this](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html) damage calculator.
---
Sent you are fr
---
I usually run at around 15% health on mine, and I don’t get melted by sentry bots, but my max HP is 670, not 235. You can 100% get better mitigation than that, but you have to focus on actual damage reduction instead of damage resistance. DR/ER look good, but don’t really mean anything. That build is missing all kinds of important cards, of course it can’t tank, it’s not setup to.
---
im selling ak on pc for 19k
---
I'm on PS and I know that at least my Mk1 hand isn't fast enough to do this as an indicator of time, unlike what a data miner could provide. My layman's observations are 2x faster than handmade, 3x or more compared to fixer.
---
Thanks for the calculator, gonna check it out!
---
I still can’t fathom why dropping items with atomic shop skins are even possible... Why does it not just say “This item has an atomic shop skin and can’t be dropped.”? Why even give us the option to even drop our skinned items into the ether? It makes no sense...
---
Bethesda, Nobody has ever wanted to drop a weapon or armor piece with a skin on it and destroy it... EVER. So just removed the option to drop skinned gear.
---
I would like to see an Accelerated Prime barrel....
---
yes
---
Absolutely not. Damage and dps you can achieve on handmade is so much higher that slightly faster reload speed can't make up for the difference.
---
Or just not get them at all?
---
I might be mistaken. I might be another mine in the south east of the map. I’ll double check when I’m on later.
---
Hehe nice
---
that's a amazing camp mate ✌️ I love it
---
Yeh I guess, any idea why it did this? I was building an underground base when I realised
---
I used the elevator and the jump on the overhead line 😁 Thank you very much ✌️
---
Thanks a lot 😁✌️
---
God it was total hell not having a hazmat suit or power armor at lower levels... Just an endless loop of dying over and over in a nuke zone during scorched earth. I’m so glad I have the stealth suit now, that sh*t is staying on a hot key wheel for quick access. 
---
(This is also the reason I’m never dropping a nuke on the queen again. Even with a suit it’s annoying to respawn in a nuke zone, have to put on a suit, and slowly walk back to the fight because it took off all my UNY armor pieces. I don’t have to do that with Earl.)
---
Thank you very much 😁 You don't want to know how often I felt down when I built this 🤣
---
Fist weapons are confirmed bugged and should be fixed before then. Shotguns are bugged to get ridiculous damage in VATS and I believe that might be fixed next patch. Heavy energy guns are bugged to not display damage properly in the PTS. The rest of the weapons all depend on how many perks/buffs youre stacking
---
Thank you very much mate... what an honor ☺️✌️
---
There will be some who exclusively seek under levelled great rolls who may pay a premium. It's a buyers market though.
---
Small chance &gt; no chance
---
Yeah, silo runs, to shorcut the reactor repair, you need to picklock and hack level 3
---
Who knows what wastelanders would do but right now for sure the lv 35 vs 45 damage isn't that noticeable, it's bloodied explosive!
---
give it time. maybe 15 years from now you'll say "I feel like playing fo76" and will find a privately hosted server. 
---
Minecraft and GTA V both have a tremendous amounts of private servers too.
---
one, how do you have 670 hp? and two, in that clip I have all the major mitigation perks and effects. dodgy, serendipity, ricochet. a full sentinel set. tons of AP regen. yeah, it's not optimal. but even if I had 15 end, lifegiver and class freak for 377,5 hp, that's only 30 more at 19% health. not to mention I'd be foregoing on several damage perks.
---
it wouldn't change the incoming damage you're seeing in that clip. maybe it'd keep me alive for a few seconds longer, assuming all the rng perks procced. but it's a far cry from the other test I did in PA, in which I could just stand there for minutes.
---
did you saw that I didn't placed my camp modul at the top of my camp? thats the reason why I'm spawning on the rail 🤣
---
That is if you dont take into consideration the SPECIAL points..
---
For example, as a shotgunner main, I dont need 3 in perception, except to shortcut the reactor repair in the silos. So this legendary perk for free will let me reallocate 2 points from perception somewhere else.
---
Thank you 🤣 I placed my camp at the overhead line and the started with conduits and carpets....(I know I'm very crazy)
---
Jup, younare right! I really often use suitcases as stairs 😁 you can build staircases too wirh it:
---
https://youtu.be/xWgm9eZ8Zm8
---
All you need for a shotgun to be magic is an armor piece with blocking 15%.  Then even vanilla shotguns do magic damage
---
No, but that shouldn't matter. Excavator still gives way more weight than other PAs, Shocks shouldn't be 100% necessary to use PA in the first place.
---
If I use Ultracite, my weight is 12 or so under encumbrance so until I get Ultracite Shocks, I cannot use it.
---
That is the problem.
---
With fallout 1st you can do this with a private server, but theres a chance the game might crash and you'll be unable to get back onto the same server.
---
On the trade subs you can find couriers who have high karma. They operate by tip though, but are very trustworthy. Make sure you find the right sub.
---
1% is still only 1% higher than 0 🤷
---
not to mention they listened to people 'just complaining' before, like with the BoS collectron.
---
Bout to break out the tenderizer for my meat 😳
---
Best part is, back in BETA they had a welcome mat camp item that would act as the fast travel landing point.
---
They took that out long ago for whatever reason
---
Been looking at old posts, are you on xbox perhaps?
---
I feel like I play a lot of this game, am at over 1300 hours, lvl 264 with my 1 character, saw a lvl 1824 in the wild and was in awe. Followed them back to their camp and bought calibrated shocks from them. There will always be bigger fish.
---
Nice. I'm on Xbox tho.
---
I've picked up a Vampire's ffr AR that I plan to use during Daily Ops, because my B handmade (my main) is better for stealth. And you can't use stealth in Daily Ops.  
---
And the fact that they both use the same ammo means I only have to carry one type of ammo.
---
The Vampire's effect will keep me alive so I can stay as a low health build without dying, and putting a quick mag on the AR makes the reload so fast that there's almost no downtime between mags.
---
Thank you 🤣 I placed my camp at the overhead line and started then with conduits and carpets (I know I'm crazy). 
---
And yes thats are suitcases 🤣 I really often use them to build stairs... you can build staircases with them too:
---
I've literally never had this happen.  Maybe it is a console only thing?
---
Thank you very much 🤣✌️
---
Is that Rick Astley in the background?
---
The second we get perk loadouts, it loses a lot of shine.
---
I speak from experience as a PC player. It takes me all of a second to swap loadouts
---
You know that's a magic effect combat armor piece right?
---
The only thing that would make sense is a bluegrass station for West Virginia lol. You get 100+ hours of banjo. Sorry.
---
Old stash use to be 400. Deal with it basicly. No point complaining when there’s options that you don’t want to use
---
These second part of your question about screwing up the excavator quest line I have no idea, sounds like it would have been a common mistake so I would imagine Bethesda have patched it by now. 
---
The first part about item transfers how ever can be done 2 ways. 
---
1. It requires you to have fallout 1st, go to whitespring train station on a private server, dump your gear into a suitcase, switch characters then log back into private. It SHOULD load you back into the same server where you can collect your items. Be aware so many things can go wrong with this, I have done it 100+ times and the only time it lost gear was because when going to pick private world I clicked on public instead. 
---
2. This is by far the best and safest way, get on the market place sub reddit. They have dedicated couriers that are approved by the mods of the sub. As long as you check the people out on the sub's list of couriers you will be completely safe. 
---
I assume you are not on the market place sub yet, so I would suggest getting on and doing a few small trades first. Ask around on it for help and people will give you tips and tricks to help you get started. They really are a great bunch, there is a few toxic players of course but they are few and fae between. I have done around 300 trades on there and never had a problem. The one thing that is worth noting is they have a sperate karma rating system to reddits own karma. Its is gained by by players rewarding each other after successful trades.
---
I think it goes 
---
Double Barrel Shotgun - High Damage, Slow Fire Rate
---
Pump Shotgun - In Between
---
Combat Shotgun - Low Damage, Faster Fire Rate
---
I feel you... i lost my bloodied explosive 0.5cal too
---
Honestly, that plan should be given the first time you complete the event, and formula P the second. The diffusers are needed for that challenge and yet. They’re borderline unobtainable without severe luck in getting the plan.
---
*cue Johnny guitar for the 99th time*
---
And 76 is fallout with multiplayer in it.
---
You just can’t get over that.
---
The right buffs make a huge difference TBH. When I’m pushing my HP, I use vodka, a hotdog, and psychobuff. If you have on strange in numbers, party boy, and run carnivore, you can really max out food and drink buffs. The hotdog is 75hp for an hour, vodka is another 75hp, psychobuff stacks on those. You can even run pemmican to push it higher, and get an additional 25hp by running a fasnacht sausage instead of the hotdog. Sausage alone is 100 max hp with carnivore and strange in numbers. Even with lower endurance, you can push it pretty high with the right buffs. I usually don’t run the vodka, but I’m still just under 600hp without it. 
---
Something else that makes a huge difference that gets overlooked a lot is the right aid setup. So with mine, I run field surgeon to start since stims work quicker. Then I have on born survivor, and an auto stim piece. To max those out, I only carry super stims. I can’t remember the exact timing, but you’re getting 2, then 1, then 2 again about every 60 seconds if you keep taking damage. Take all that and factor in 5 sentinel pieces, it’ll take a massive beating before you die. The incoming damage doesn't change, but you’re mitigating it instead of trying to beat it with higher resistance. The game is kind of misleading in that department, 900 DR/ER should out tank a health/aid focused build, but it doesn’t.
---
It's why I stopped playing. I would spend more time worrying about my inventory than out enjoying the game and the "solution" of buying a subscription is idiotic.
---
the bad news billy and beelzebilly recolors come to mind. there's also the elusive clean mr. fuzzy suit. and I think there was a grafton monster one, too.
---
Learn to manage your scrap and also sell it. That’s a pretty early level to have filled your stash. It’s really not that difficult to get around.
---
Lol absolutely not.
---
What if it shouts at you and you get sick?
---
I’ve had that happen before. Imagine standing in the Whitesprings bunker for a good five minutes shopping around and tinkering and whatnot, then all of a sudden every robot just drops dead at the same time. 
---
It’s creepy as hell.
---
I tend to find a place close to my camp (all my characters are camped in the same location) and make sure that a buddy is online to anchor me there, and just drop it in a file cabinet and hastily switch chars.
---
If you're on ps4, you can use my private world to xfer, just let me know and I'll send you my psn.
---
Agreed, Quad Double Barrel is the best in DPS. I managed to buy a Q2525 Double Barrel off a vendor for 2k. It absolutely shreds in VATS or manual aiming.
---
Double actually has the fastest fire rate as it fires as fast as you can hit the trigger, just limited by the 2 mag size and reloading. If you can get a Quad with 8 shots, you can mag dump super quick.
---
Don’t store any aids, find out what junk you use to repair and keep the rest at a bare minimum. Most legendary items you get are scrip anyways. 800 is enough to keep your apparel, guns and ammo. You can even just keep your ammo on you, there are perk cards to reduce the weight to 90% Learning to manage what to keep and throw out is actually a good life skill in general. The stash limit used to be 400... now that is unmanageable, but stash in my opinion is one of the least of my concerns with the game. Can Bethesda fix the fuckin’ crashes and bugs already? PLEASE.
---
personally I dislike buffs. I don't think it's a good idea to rely on temporary stats, or even rng perks too much. but that's just me.
---
I mean, yeah. I guess. if you're buffing yourself that much. but it's like those melee builds staged to speedrun bosses. it's not something I think the average player is looking for when building a character.
---
not saying it's not a valid build or strategy, but you can't assume everyone is going to have fridge full of sausages. I don't even use born survivor outside of boss fights. and without all of that, I'm assuming your build would fare about the same as in the clip, or only slightly better if you have 15 end and lifegiver/class freak.
---
which, again, is a far cry from just hopping into a set of PA.
---
 I see people say we just shouldn’t hoard legendaries or all this “garbage” but the entire game is built around gathering to survive so wtf is that argument
---
This vid will demonstrate how to do it far better than I can explain it
---
https://youtu.be/Fp3TOm48m8E
---
Update: Roxy STILL hasn't reset.
---
Yeah, that's what I meant dude. Chat banned.
---
So you're suggesting that you got banned just for what you said? So it's not the "light" trolling that you already admitted to?
---
I would take it over hearing “and I’m sooo sorry my friends” for the 10000000000th time
---
Like guy above said those were in the atom shop at onetime but you’re also missing the gopher? I’m not sure what it is but soiled spawns upstairs only a locked room at dolly sods.
---
Not 100 but my friend said its not
---
I would definitely have more than one camp if we could. Like, I'd build a cool little newbie vendor near the vault, but get to keep my comfy little camp that I've built as well.  Great idea!
---
Yup totally
---
I have those exact same legendary effects for my SS armor. It served me well for my shotgun build. But I no longer need the piece.
---
No due to the gamer tag
---
oh, yeah. the tattered mole outfit. there was also a pristine one in the shop at some point. plus a thanksgiving turkey outfit.
---
frankly most of the 'fursuits' are from the shop. op is gonna have a hard time gathering all of them now.
---
Have them give you like 10 scrip/boullion and many more players will go hunting
---
Maybe that's what makes it cursed.
---
&gt; You are just trying to justify your opinion. 
---
Nope. Just going off the evidence as presented. If they just said plans, we'd be having a very different conversation but since it's those specific things in volume, like I said, you'd have to be wilfully ignorant to just not see it.
---
&gt;  I'm a duper as well because of your so called "evidence." 
---
Oh no. Evidence doesn't show that at all. You being rather slow on the other than, plenty of evidence has been presented there, so there's that.
---
A giveaway it is.
---
You can't actually pick up most items like the weapons, they'll pop up the prompt but it won't go in your inventory.
---
Or bugs bite / sting you.
---
Eh. People up and down vote for inexplicable reasons. Truthfulness has nothing to do with it at all.
---
I appreciate the sentiment all the same. Looks like you're getting a little downvoting of your own. An upvote to compensate.
---
It’s definitely more of a refined build than most, but even without the food buffs, I rarely die. Born survivor and auto stim eat supers though, so it’s kind of a trade off. I have to carry a ton of them, but I don’t have to respawn at 25% health and rad back down every couples of minutes during a fight. If I ran heavy gun, I’d hop in t65 and call it a day, but you can definitely perk out to survive as a bloodied non PA build with some patience and planning. My biggest aid is probably distance though, lol, I try to stay away from or above everything I can.
---
&gt;u/LoneVaultWanderer
---
Yes, and people would literally BUY slots for camps for $, imagine.
---
Damn it I forgot the turkey that thing is hilarious
---
Daddy likes.
---
If your PA has recon sensor in the helmet, you can track his exact locations even when he’s above ceiling or under floor, then you can try to hit him from different angles and lure him out. Otherwise he’ll just stay static in the glitched area and won’t move.
---
Then that should be reported as a bug
---
Lots of MMOs seem to end up with community written servers post sunset.
---
Nuclear winter is different from adventure mode pvp. Griefing is not what your addressing because you never brought it up or mentioned it. Pvp can happen anywhere. Your post is saying that there isn't a point in pvp, but I could also say there is no point in the collosal problem event, they both give players fun so they both have a point, if you dislike pvp, just don't do it, and I don't like the colossal problem event so I don't do it. There's an option that allows you to avoid all pvp. And if your getting griefers that's too bad because it happens in literally every game with multiplayer. Even if they were to remove adventure mode pvp, players would still grief.
---
For this much gold I want a freaking assaultron mod that turns me into Cyclops whenever I start a fight thx.
---
"The hassle of being in a public group". 
---
What? You press two buttons and you are in a public team. And 99.9% of people just do their own thing. I have never encountered anyone being even mildly annoying.
---
What platform,  and what's your psn I'll add you,  I have many incrypted cards
---
Sadly that ship sailed along time ago. Unless a massive group of us drop off the map and stop playing the game and, more importantly, stop spending money on this game, that's never changing. Maybe not even then.
---
&gt;P.S. if the mods remove this post one more time on some arbitrary nonsense, let it be known it's because they suck and can't handle the truth
---
Or if could be that broke the rules of the sub. Good luck either way.
---
That's a pretty rigid self suspending log.
---
Very concise breakdown, thx!
---
I mean with all the other ridiculously silly immersion breaking content they've added they definitely should add this
---
Yeah, sorry bud but I guess this game isn't for you. 800 stash is double what this game started with, so you're already better off than we use to be.
---
Treasury notes, scrip and vendors are all individual 20 hour timers from your first use of one in a day. All vendors count as one however.
---
Not sure on daily’s as some can be hit multiple times a day, like forbidden knowledge.
---
Play it again...

i only have targeting hud sadly

\-Official Bethesda response we all get.
---
I get fog crawler waves pretty regularly defending dolly sods and berkeley springs.
---
I wonder if a late 60's early 70's *Canadian Rock* station would work too, 70s seems a little outside Fallout's stylistic wheelhouse - but that could be ascribed to pre-annexation Canada being a little further along socially than USA.
---
I'd say SOL but only because of how poor Bethesda support are at dealing with any issue. This should be trivial to resolve - just give you the plans but it could take weeks, if at all.
---
You might just be better off starting over if you're not that high of a level.
---
I don’t agree. It just makes people not want to get it. There is no tactical advantage so it shouldnt be priced as such
---
If the "Animation Reload Seconds" listed [here](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/0000463F) is correct, it's 1.93 seconds for an assault rifle, 3.03 seconds for a handmade, and 3.20 seconds for a fixer or combat rifle. It sounds about right.
---
At 20 rounds per clip and 7.5 rounds per second it takes them all 2.67 seconds to empty a clip. 2.35 seconds if you have faster fire rate legendary.
---
Comparing damage against Earl, additive, for an anti-armor legendary, damages per shot are 5.73, 8.75, 7.45, and 9.56 for [assault rifle, handmade](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html?left=R_W-AssaultRifle_L-50_ModReceiver-PowerfulAutomatic_ModMagazine-Perforating_ModMuzzle-Standard_ModSights-Standard_Prefix-Antiarmor_Major-FFR_PHP-100_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-0_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_TankAP-36_Other-0_Add&amp;right=R_W-Handmade_L-45_ModReceiver-PowerfulAutomatic_ModMagazine-Perforating_ModMuzzle-Standard_ModSights-Standard_Prefix-Antiarmor_PHP-100_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-0_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_TankAP-36_Other-0_Add), [combat rifle and fixer](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html?left=R_W-TheFixer_L-50_ModReceiver-PowerfulAutomatic_ModMagazine-Perforating_ModMuzzle-Suppressor_Prefix-Antiarmor_PHP-100_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-0_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_TankAP-36_Other-0_Add&amp;right=R_W-CombatRifle_L-50_ModReceiver-PowerfulAutomatic_ModMagazine-Perforating_ModMuzzle-Standard_Prefix-Antiarmor_PHP-100_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-0_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_TankAP-36_Other-0_Add).
---
Here's the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f4dDlj-2q24GIUeAeQKp2lNhvjy-T4vlEcHux3Y6YEk/edit?usp=sharing). The handmade and fixer are 23% and 31% ahead of the assault rifle, respectively, but the combat rifle is only 2% ahead. The gap narrows a little if you're comparing faster fire rate. So I personally would take the assault rifle over a combat rifle in that fight due to way better recoil. But the fixer and handmade are still pretty far ahead. If you can land headshots more consistently with an assault rifle then it might even be the way to go, but that's not particularly difficult with Earl.
---
Either way you're definitely going to want to take the speed demon mutation if you're a commando, you spend more than half the time reloading.
---
I am surprised at how I love the mole miners as a new addition to the Fallout universe. And not all of them are homicidal maniacs, so there is room for some quests about them one day. That radio might be a start.
---
Meh, airing out grievances seems valid, esp when this shitty game still has so many problems.
---
Western Revolver too, it needs love, Single Action is too slow.
---
I've been begging for an NCR Bundle with the Scorched Sierra Power Armor, Medicine Stick skin for the Lever Action, a blood stained Bowie Knife, etc.
---
While we're at it how about Smiley's bullion exchange? I swear I turned in 1k caps for 50 bullion last thursday, then 250 bullion another day (before next thursday) for all 300, but today (next Saturday, 9 days later) I go to buy bullion and he says wait until next week. Does the reset happen a week from when you buy all 300, a specific day of the week, or is it just glitched??
---
You had me at guitar! Have an upvote :)
---
Well think about it this way. Console really has no dupes. People cant really make extra or anything. With that limited resources people in similar boats bought them and read them.
---
Rule 10 for retired posts or rule 4 for civility. My bets on 10 but we'll see.

Can i take the gatling gun i will give you some thing in return
---
My issue is the chance that I log on and find someone else in my camps spot and that means I can't use my camp of I spend ages loading another server .
---
If the plans were for mounted heads, it's simply because they were opening Christmas gifts and became over encumbered.  I've read that the Christmas gifts were duplicated a lot when the last dup glitch was active.  
---
When opened, you get a random amount of caps, random mounted head plans, lots of booze, grenades, etc.  Mostly these are opened for the caps and the rest of the stuff is typically dropped.  If you do a quick search in the forum for mounted head plans you'll find a lot of similar posts.
---
That isn't to say that it wasn't meant as a gift and if you didn't already know the plans, then that's a bonus.   Just that it's been fairly common to find these dropped in random CAMPs.  
---
As for value, the mounted heads plans aren't worth all that much today since they are so common.
---
My equipment can't get any better.

In any game that features pvp you’re gonna run the risk of people killing you. This isn’t a co-op friendly game where there is no friendly fire. Sure most people that play are cool and nice and don’t do that but at the end of the day if someone kills you while you’re taking a workshop that’s the way the devs wanted it to be otherwise they wouldn’t have made it so that taking a workshop took you out of passive mode. Don’t blame the players blame the game
---
Yes on xbox one especially halloween event outfits, plans and everything else in between are extremely expensive if you were to get them off another player
---
Wonder if we can wear it with power armor
---
Workshops are pvp areas. If you’re in it at the time someone contests it you are instantly agro with them. They didn’t block you they’re crouched so you can’t see them on the map. Honestly there’s always a better farming method for things than the workshop anyways just YouTube the routes or methods and you’ll get more junk anyway.
---
I miss that
---
When you take a workshop, other players can put caps into the workshop to contest it, which then triggers a PVP and whoever wins gets the workshop and resources..... And caps.
---
If they don't put caps in to contest, they can shoot at you all day and nothing will happen unless you shoot back. 
---
It's one of the last things people who want to PVP in Adventure Mode can do, as the devs pretty well nerfed everything else.
---
Even if you're on Pacifist mode, if someone wants the Workshop, it won't protect you. So if you don't want to PVP, then don't go after workshops.
---
Drugged by me
---
+2 perk points elsewhere vs. way better and beneficial legendary perk that will affect you 100% of the time instead of very very occationally. For example some special perk that will give you +5 to some special (thats 3 more perk points for you right there). I guarantee you will regret taking Infiltrator later on if you take it.
---
And as a shotgunner you should be taking Skeet Shooter from perception. Also, Glow Sight is nothing to frown about. Very good fillers for lock picking perks.
---
If there's any truth to the idea that limits are due to stability, then having two characters with 1600 space between them is different from one character with 1600 space of his own.  Only one character is actually loaded into the server.
---
If the mods kept by those rules a LOT more posts on this sub would be removed. Also don't have any stake in this, just lurking.
---
It really has nothing to do with where its located. Its about putting the assets where they go down to the pixel. In a living world things change. Its very hard to explain, and its even harder to accomplish. If it was a game like minecraft or rust or something sure. There are a small number of assets to be deployed. It COULD be done, just don't think there is a chance in hell it would be. Its the same reason "blueprinting" is as wonky as it is. Sometimes you can place a blueprint, sometimes you can not.  It's hard enough for you to build your camp placing each thing one at a time.
---
Are you out of budget at your camp?
---
I missed last Halloween, I started playing in the November, I ended up buying all of the plans for between 500-3000 caps each. I just put a load of spare ones that I bought for new alts up for sale at 1500 caps each and have sold out. 200+ plans shifted in less than a week. So that might be your problem, people are buying them up too fast.
---
Please tell me you at least tried to kill Mumbles.......
---
You know she needs to die.....
---
One argument could be that there was a phased release of groups of Vault Dwellers and each group is being monitored through the pipboy to make sure that Appalachia is habitable. 
---
Each group is fed the lie that Vault 76 is uninhabitable to force them to leave the Vault and not return.  It also would prevent other groups from trying to break into the Vault.
---
As others have pointed out, its about data.  But what grinds my gears is two things.  Firstly that the stash box should be in the base game and should have been since day one.  Secondly that other things can easily be stored in the same way as stash boxes - chems, pre-war food, alcohol, ammo, and more - but they choose not to do it.
---
Also, I'm not sure I buy this "server stability" schtick in the first place.  I collect 90% reduced weight guns because I'd like to have one of everything.  I have three sets of armour and six sets of PA.  I have nearly all the weight reduction perks and a set of 90% weapon weight reduction armor to swap into when I loot the giant meat pile at the end of Line In The Sand.  I can sometimes be carrying quite literally over a hundred weapons, nearly a million ammo, thousands of chems and scrap.  But apparently adding another 200lbs weight to my stash, which would not have those weight reduction perks, is going to break the server?
---
I call shenanigans.
---
Even though halloween is like a month away? No one is even willing to place items.
---
My best guess is, did you complete the instructional portion of that quest. If so then doors are probably just closed for cooldown.
---
Happens to my wife all the time. This exactly I mean, sometimes she can just build all wallpapers. They stay if you put them on but the ability to choose them comes and goes. For her anyways. They won’t ban you they used to accidentally release atom shop stuff sometimes. You didn’t purposefully do anything yourself to get them. If you’re really worried submit a ticket.
---
Thanks!!
---
That's fair. How come people won't even place at camps though? Cause halloween is literally right around the corner
---
As long as we can't have Dogmeat in Fallout 76, Fallout 4 will always be the better RPG.
---
First off, unfortunately you learned about workshop griefing first hand. So once upon a time 76 was considerably more pvp oriented,  going so far as to be able to kill someone with or without pvp consent from the other player, meaning you could be 'murdered'.
---
Now this was eventually fixed and a dedicated pvp mode called survival was provided, this took most of the toxic players and put them in their own world where they could grief to their hearts content.  
---
Survival was eventually removed meaning that they now have to go back to adventure and can't simply 'murder' other players anymore, so they fiend over workshops.
---
Workshops for whatever reason automatically consents to pvp (it warns you this but I still think it's stupid) meaning if you're new to the game and you wanted to farm a workshop for resources and mind your own business then you unknowingly and unintentionally invited one of those thirsty ex survival guys whose been watching the map, checking all the workshops. This can happen instantly as they just have to enter workshop area to contest it. 
---
The lower your level the more susceptible you are to this breed of toxic player as the rules of engagement are murky at best and most of them are equipped with absurd pvp based armor and weaponry.
---
TLDR: workshops are the last remnants of the initial pvp design of 76 and so usually attract players whose sole interest is to kill the owner either for personal gain or for the satisfaction of it.
---
Only thing that is lost is a little reputation from the faction you don't choose. I do advise doing the settlers quest line just to get the Chinese stealth suit for free instead of 4k bullion
---
Don't listen to him zachy, Santa lives in the north pole
---
Dude you get a warning when claiming a workshop, you understand what PvP means I assume. If so then stop botching for god sake. Sorry to sound so rude but it gets so tiresome hearing people complain about losing junk during workshop PvP.
---
You are solo but the rest of teams most likely aren’t
---
I dont know im not them.
---
I know how that feels! I made the same camp at the same location hahah! https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/comments/inkqf7/posting_again_with_slightly_higher_res_images_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
The helmet is a vanity item, and everyone knows lookin' stylish is much more important then good stats. ;)
---
I actually thought about doing that idea as I was typing out my post. I actually thought about risking some mats being given to someone but at the same time the main items get placed in a trash can or something near by and swap and grab the main loot first and meet the nearby buddy and hopefully get the decoy back. Cause at least if I did get ripped off I can at least mention what I'd really done so I wouldn't feel as dumb. I'm really just wasn't sure how well things tend to remain in objects like desks and cabinets while disconnecting and reconnecting. Does an active player need to remain a certain distance within the loot to keep it from resetting? Or is it more or less a set time when things reset or respawn?
---
Just allow us to change the light. Bright light all the way.
---
Where did anyone say that its a rank 4 perk to get ? All people who will take it will only take the level 1.
---
And what way better and bénéficial free legendary perk you can get as a 6th perk ?
---
+ 2 perception for 1 Legendary perk is 100 perk coins or 2 slots vs free and 1 slot taking the infiltrator legendary perk. 
---
And why would I need Skeet Shooter ? Magic shotgun is the way to go. And glowing sight is a waste in an additive damage model.
---
When did you become salky
---
Not really I have some budget left. Took one heavy gun out and wanted to place another heavy gun on the same display case. The old one was displayed but the new one isn’t displayed.
---
Where is the funny?
---
But the Gauntlet has the upside of being craftable as legendary, so why wouldn't you see it? I sure as hell haven't found any random drop power fists with Instigating, +40% speed, and -90% weight on them, but that's what I was able to get rolling Gauntlets.
---
Well yes it was me and I tried change name but guess it didnt work.  Im not senile, I have sickness and yes memory is affected.
---
Touche. Sorry for all the dumb questions haha.
---
Yeah this is the first I've heard of the market place sub. It sounds like a rather clever way of going about building credibility for people. Props to the one who thought of that idea forsure. Thanks mate
---
So even when you go in by yourself, everyone else may be on a team? I didn't know that!
---
I feel you, I also lost some legendaries recently on the same way 🙈
---
Hope they add mods to chinese armor
---
Thanks man I appreciate it, lemme know when you're available
---
Stuff will stay in containers for quite a while, even after you log off. This is way you stash on a container, not a bag.
---
The reason you want a friend o line in the same world is so yiu can find the same world straight away. I made the mistake of stashing some very, very valuable weapons with no one online, and then spent an hour and 20 minutes server hopping to find them. Was not a fun experience.
---
You’ve posted this 3times lol.
---
They can be swapped but pts are saying it will cost a perk coin to do so.
---
Don't know what botching means. I do know what pvp means. I didn't know workshops were pvp areas. Just found out from someone else who answred. Sorry u feel im complaining, im just trying to seak more information. In both instances i was literally crafting this last time bulking when i was killed. As i said im more a casual gamer. Get on for a few hours and thas about it.
---
I was under the impression that both partues had to agree ti the pvp byt i guess not. It is what it is though. Lesson learned
---
I don’t have problems with camp defenses and honestly? I usually get attacked by Anglers or Yao Guai due to being the Lead/Junk camp in the toxic valley. On that note, I *would* like them to be stronger for higher level areas, such as the mire or bog. 
---
I think they only ignore threats if line of sight on target is lost for some time. Like, if you have a main building and a field outside, have a turret from the main building aiming into the field, and one from the edge of the field to the main building to get 2x coverage.
---
I recommend taking workshops in the forest. That will help you level up and get XP without putting you in front of all the nightmarish radiated behemoths immediately ;)

I love my Junkies heavy gunner and Berserker commando. Both are a blast.
---
So long as that banjo keeps on twangin'
---
Where's the proof and testing for this? If it's angryturtles vids it's likely false
---
I bought the concrete tires from the atom shop, stacked them and put the turret on top to see if it would improve their detection but nope, good old mangy rat chewing the mutfruit plant while turrets were playing poker.
---
He's wrong about a lot
---
Lol a lot of people here don't know how empath works
---
Same with legendary and non legendary equipment, the amount of times I’ve fast travelled to a camp to see what weapons they have for sale and it’s 14 10mm pistols ranging from lvl 10-40
---
You do know what game you're playing, yes?
---
The range for turrets is already rediculous
---
What the hell? Thanks for letting me know. It randomly did it.
---
Gets refund
---
Yes! That too.
---
sadly she is invunerable
---
How much does class freak reduce the bird bones limb damage nerf?
---
Their range is rediculous no need for a buff
---
It won’t let me place the wall ones and I have budget left. I wondered about that.
---
You are not planning on upgrading your legendary perks? Thats kinda dumb :D Abusing bugs is not gonna last forever, and if 60% additive damage is a waste for you then why not get rid of your shotgunner perks too?
---
But hey, you do you. You'll regret it :)
---
The database design is dogshit. If they broke each view down further into categories they would reduce the strain of the call up on the database server, eg weapons screen broken down into lists of type, aid broken down into food, drink, meds. Bethesda know this because they already do this in ESO. 
---
The way that the naming conventions are applied also causes issues. These are all things designed and can be fixed by Bethesda.
---
When it comes to the resources assigned to the database servers, usually weightings are set on shared resource these weightings can be adjusted.
---
It all smells too much like a system with designed inefficiencies that will push users to pay for 1st to help alleviate the issues. So you technically may be correct but your conclusion is wrong, Bethesda are money grabbing arseholes using poor design to push revenue in a partial solution.
---
I wouldn't say 76 is a better RPG, but it at least lacks Emil Pagliarulo's god awful writing.
---
There is no atom cost to level your legendary perk cards. Leveling to 4 stars costs 300 legendary perk points not 450. They also raised the earned points 2 because of community feedback so I doubt it going back to 1 also.
---
Pvp is the only fun thing to do in the game anymore
---
That would be amazing
---
Dolly sods wilderness has the tattered mole outfit
---
Shhh just don’t learn the recipe if you think it’ll “dilute ur drop pool” you twat
---
Are you choosing and allocating perk cards for a specific build, I.e heavy guns?
---
Yeah people just hold on to returning event items and expect to get b2525 fixers and legacy weapons for halloween items. 
---
Some of the player trades are just plain insanity.
---
You get a warning when you claim the workshop. There is a pop up that tells you workshops are PvP areas, and that choosing to claim a workshop opens you up to PvP. 
---
If you somehow missed that then do a search on here, tonnes and tonnes of threads about this exact same thing. Or you could use google/YouTube also full off information.
---
Build! Build! Build!
---
It’s always the build if you aren’t killing normal mobs  in a few shots
---
You are technically correct.
---
However, it's worth mentioning that specific technical knowledge doesn't seem to apply in this scenario. All the guns are mirrored, after all, despite no good reason existing for this.
---
That the combat rifle shares a suppressor with the combat shotgun fits the world building, even though it wouldn't actually work very well IRL.
---
The ideal player behaviour for Bethesda is if you play little and often. They want to increase Server traffic without having to increase Server resource (more bang for their buck). The limits are there to promote this behaviour. The whole “seasons” thing is just this, logon every day to complete a few tasks grab your score and leave. 
---
The design is so Bethesda can shout about their “number of active players” without having to rent more server space.
---
The “end game” for FO76 is a game of Pavlov’s dog, keep repeating the task and you’ll get a treat and eventually you might get a nice treat.
---
I havent tried the quick reload mag yet. That stacked with speed demon must be quite something! Definitely worth trying for a comparison when Daily Ops hits next week
---
Where can you find the clean mr. Fuzzy suit? I'm the one who made this post but for some reason instead of my usual name, it changed it to critical business when not using app.
---
When i tried with First aid and Team medic it seemed like the regen was not stronger on the target, i guess if the target has "First aid" it does work tho but that's pure theory
---
Try two turrets with overlapping views and different angles.
---
They nailed it in the bog, i was always relieved to find hostile human enemies rather than a wendigo or any of the local wildlife because it was less scary
---
Thanks. Never seen a gopher one before. I'll go on private server and check it out later. I'm op but didn't use app when making post so it did a weird name.
---
Goodbye, lock picking cards
---
I havent gotten a single item I really wanted through about 4.5k scrip. On the upside, vendor hopping has allowed me to get 2 weapons i really wanted since so many people have excess guns for sale xd
---
You want to...repair food?
---
The shovel on the ghillie backpack is so annoying, surely it wouldn't be hard to have it only there when you are actually carrying a ahovel
---
Agree. Exact reason why the radical mask is nerfed.
---
Check out this vid also which shows you how to pot tatos, corn etc.
---
https://youtu.be/sahlOICt5e0
---
But backpack mods exist... this would just add a new layer of mods and make backpacks even more essential for non PA than they are now.
---
PA users don't need another disadvantage, I say that and I don't even really use PA.
---
Oh thats interesting never knew, might swap that perk out now thanks
---
It’s the tattered mole like buddy said. Shouldn’t be hard to get couple servers at most.
---
Which is fine given it’s a business. But as OP says, why limit us so we don’t buy any items in the atom shop? I suppose when Beth becomes more used to online gaming, they will loosen up and let us store more stuff.
---
I notice you got that disease my guy.... Something you wanna tell us about the two of you? ;)
---
What lv and legendary effects are on your railway rifle?
---
Meanwhile i can stash 100000 different holotapes, notes and other 0 weight items.
---
All this doesn't make much sense.
---
I think the whole stash limit fiasco is there to just sell fo1st.
---
I run full heath but this is my PA heavy gunner
---

---
Yeah, sometimes mobile posts but out, say they didn’t post.
---
Yeah I think they are a little bit bugged. Changed server and the new added weapons still aren’t displayed but I can place them in the cases and they are shown as displayed. And I have atleast 5-8% of my camp budget left. I can place the cases for the heavy guns on the floor and the wall ones on my wall but I have some trouble that they are connecting with themselves. Maybe just some certain weapon types won’t show on it currently. For example if I put my handmade on it it is displayed but not my new assault rifle. My .50cal is displayed but my new harpoon gun isn’t.
---
 Meanwhile i can stash 100000 different holotapes, notes and other low weight items. 
---
And the stash loads fine.
---
I only spent 1k but out of that got an *AA-fuckaround-bow* (technical name) and a Two-shot +50% Crit +15% Crit gain Fixer which is gonna be my Earl smacking device (I run Instigating Fixer atm which is useless on bosses).
---
Keep in mind the Purveyor has fucked me over since the dawn of man so I take these two weapons without blinking or jubilation.
---
Also- shout out to those few cleaning out her pie machine!! I went to smack the button between rolls for luck and there wasn't a pie all weekend virtually.
---
I spent 900 scrip on modules
---
Yeah the dupers I've seen with thousands of maps would love that.
---
About to get king-hit sucker style.
---
Staple of Ghoul combat.
---
I'd expect the Mole Miners to enjoy old pro-Union songs, and songs about events like the Battle of Blair Mountain and the Ludlow Massacre to get them fired up to fight against automation and those who'd threaten their way of life. Or maybe just old folk songs in general.
---
The real problem is actually those grenades.  I mean, if you insist Bethesda, make SS armour and gauss weapons untradeable.  But the *utter fucking garbage that NOBODY wants* absolutely should not be treated like anyone at all gives a fraction of a shit about them.  I don't care that you think they're worth bullion, they definitely aren't, so stop pretending they are and just let us drop or trade them ffs.
---
There was also another bug not long ago where godmod allowed people to bypass limits on stacking xp boosts and how much xp they could get. Some finished season 1 in a day for example.
---
"...we have an incoming nerf which will affect bloody characters, it doesn’t really bother me as I play full health explosive shotgunners... "
---
You may wish to read up on the 'Bloodied Nerf'. It is in fact a cross board rebalance that will affect ALL builds and characters.
---
Yup mole moma has been throwing bloodied weapons my way too.
---
10 minutes is quite a long time lol
---
Your still standing a solid few inches off the ground in the armor :/
---
2020 in a nutshell 😅
---
Not to mention half the time "steal from" prompts are in white for me, because video games
---
Raises hand
---
MY LAZY ASS, THATS WHO
---
I love sweet rolls.
---
ALL builds are going to be affected by the change to damage calculations. Bloodied will still be the highest damage build. Hold onto your gun and your builds because you will probably still be using them
---
Yep, this and more.  Im sure there proud of their 6 White wolf fedora's, but their no use to me.
---
In a lot of ways, The Mire is what I wish Far Harbor and Point Lookout were. It's dark and dangerous. There's always something going on and there's always something hiding and waiting for you.
---
IMO, The Mire is the best part of FO76 and I wish they'd put a lot more stuff to do there.
---
What swapping, rank 1 allows unlocking everything. Higher ranks are for skipping the minigame
---
Thursday I got a j/25/Ag handmade.  Yesterday I got a j/crit/25 fixer.  I’m ok with that.
---
Also got a berserker/e/25 fixer that I’m saving just in case berserker gets a buff down the line.
---
Finally, someone with the guts to help me get the "kill wanted players" challenge.
---
&gt; 1,650 bouillon 
---
Now, if only I could remember the name of the location and the exact Fallout game that had the series of terminals with internal company memos from a soup factory about Bouillon the Dog. 
---
Googling does not help at all, thanks to gold bullion. Am I completely misremembering and/or hallucinating?
---
Well, we’re assholes to everyone but each other so why not! We launch nukes for fun and kill everyone we meet, unless they’re essential and then we’d still kill them anyway.
---
I want unwanted levels
---
If this could happen, it would be game changing. I loved to build in FO4 and the fact you could build crazy settlements was awesome. Unfortunately 76 provided some great building options, but limited space and build budget. I have reduced my hours invested in this game post LR and would jump straight back in if this was to occur. Great idea, hope it gains some momentum.
---
Hngngmhngm....
---
                               Punmch,
---
I’d suspect this would likely be a 1st thing, if they could even do it. Would love this idea... Makes me wish it was already in the game.
---
My modlist is non-existent. The only mod I had was the unofficial patch. I ended up disabling it and doing a new play through for the achievements.
---
I always collect one run, I mean all 4 hallways and it usually gives around ~40 ores. 
---
do the nodes respawn for me? can I collect more ores after a certain time or condition has passed? I usually hold the ores with me until the timer is running out or there are at least ~65 already deposit so we dont get harder mobs.
---
edit: I also heal the lose... I mean scavengers with my shiskebab. wish more people would do that during events
---
At the minute ANY shotgun with either the limb damage, bashing damage or 33% vats hit chance legendary effect will one shot everything except world bosses the trick is that you HAVE to use VATS to shoot them for it to work, if you don’t use vats it won’t work. The best shotgun would be a combat.. then a pump action. Try to add a hardened receiver to it if you can as it will help give more damage to guarantee the one hit kill. The best legendary effect would be instigating.. again to guarantee the one shot kill, another is two shot but again this isn’t a must.. just as long as you have one of those legendary effects I mentioned above. It should be easy to find a shotgun in a vendor with these effects as they drop very consistently. If however you can’t find one then if you have 1 piece of armor with the 15% damage while blocking effect then equip this and you can use any shotgun even if it’s just one you have crafted.. doesn’t even need to be legendary. It just helps if you have a higher damage shotty is all just to make sure of the one shot kill. But even with the standard crafted shotty with the armor should be ok. Hope this helps you
---
Oh dear, you arent going to he happy  when the patch drops :-)
---
My theory is that everyone believes that only they are capable of defending solo and so everyone else should get it. 
---
Either that or they're in power armour/and or bloody build and it's extreme radiation down there.
---
Or they're idiots and don't realise the event ends when you get 100 ore.
---
Lol
---
*cries in I haven’t seen mine in 19 years*
---
If found this out with my two shot pump action, i  can sneak around with it and i take most things down straight away.  And its the best shotgun i have, will start looking for a decent double barrel after what you have said.
---
Not a griefer?? Lies!
---
I like staying up top and saving the scavengers. You really only need a couple people getting the ore anyway, and the rest killing off the ghouls.
---
I always had a hard time with the ore bc I don't use power armor (never have, in any of the games, just not my thing), so I have to switch to a hazmat suit which will oftentimes overencumber me bc I lose a few good pieces of deep pocketed. 
---
What I recently started doing if i realize that literally no one is getting ore and i want at least a level 1 reward, i switch to my hazmat &amp; then have a few armor pieces saved to my favorites wheel that i can quickly switch back to once i get out of the rads. That's been working pretty well &amp; i end up doing most of the event naked that way so it's comical 😂
---
I think it’s a cap on how much bobble head effects can stack. It was crazy back when the game launched, there was no cap on it so it wasn’t too unusual to see dupers dupe hundreds of bobble heads, use them all at once, and do 250,000 damage in one shot
---
That’s what I meant by trolling dude jeez who the hell hurt you so much
---
The ore only respawns when you deposit although you get progressively more powerful creatures to fight the higher the tier you achieve.
---
It's the worst, yeah. I wish I could help more on ore duty but until I get my carry weight bullshit together putting on my stealth suit for rad resist puts me massively overencumbered, so I only ever do it when none of the goofs in power armor actually want to work. And then I waddle through the sludge, shoving AP regen food down my throat so I can still actually move.
---
On the flipside, exactly one time I have experienced the opposite dynamic to the usual of "why is no one on ore duty?". We actually had like 4 or 5 people in the event and only one was actually defending. Goofy weird moment.
---
^This.  I have no idea what this, i assume is an Apache Helicopter, said, but I agree 100%.
---
Berserker FFR fixer. Best weapon i've played with for years
---
I was kind of expecting that one. 
---
Do you know if team medic works with auto stim on armor or born survivor?
---
I know the mobs get harder. this is why I said I keep them on me until time is running out or we have enough already deposited so when I deposit the ones I have we hit 100 and finish the event.
---
Ahh that makes sense I was gob smacked then was gonna say 25 team damage damn thats op. Sounds decent that though, so it works out as 17 percent damage resistance even if teammate is not next to you?
---
It does suck but there's lots of options on managing it. If you want specific advice I'm happy to throw ideas out there.
---
but now that you’re telling me that they respawn only if I deposit them I’ll be left with a tactical choice.
---
I have a vampire handmade I never used. Thanks for the tip.
---
I dunno... As buggy as blueprinting and the entire CAMP system is, your kinda shooting for the stars dont ya think? ...Id settle for a custom Camp/Vender name for fast traveling to.
---
Update drops on my birthday and i have work off then and the next day 😎
---
Hahaha. I'm level 40 and have no idea what you're talking about because I'm not that good at the game
---
Yes. I'm experiencing that too. There was another post on here a few days ago with a similar problem. I've just stored the ally now because they stopped spawning in altogether.
---
Blueprint ammo machines much?..
---
No problem👍

Ever read Stormlight Archives? Search shartplate in reddit 😂 thats how bodily functions work. Right in the armour

I've heard on some posts here thats there areore spots that constantly spawn mobs if selected so could try that
---
Power fist build, no power armour so can take perks like marathoner. Very fast gameplay and very fun to play. Only downside is scorchbeast suck to fight unless they land.
---
Sneaky lever action rifle, this is probably the best build for farming since can 1 shot everything apart from the bosses and behemoth and it's cheap to run too because you don't take damage and use less bullets. Try get an instigating lever action for ultimate farming.
---
Or power armour and heavy gunner. Very tanky build and great all round damage dealer.
---
He is on PC, but thanks for your nice thought anyway 👍
---
You may already know, but there's a mod that does this already. I don't know how I played without it and I would never go back. It's called 'Perk Loadout Manager'

Also curious about the Clean Mr Fuzzy. I've heard it's supposed to be an Atom Shop item that hasn't been released and the existing ones originate from Illicit Deeds. Is that true or is it just some kinda goofy rare drop?
---
I've been wondering whether you could heal the scavs, thanks for answering that question
---
Or Herpes.... could give him herpes.

 "Revenge is an oinment you have to put on daily"
---
Do the Deathclaw masks count as fursuit pieces
---
What about the Mothman apparel (some things obviously aren't but with so much headwear based on a bug boy surely something counts)
---
[It was in New Vegas' Honest Hearts DLC](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/.45_Auto_pistol) so there's a precedent for it in the Fallout Universe.
---
Probably won't be called the 1911 for legal reasons, though.
---
Im the only one that gets it... kinda why i stopped doing the event all together
---
Repairing food would be better for the planet, come on man
---
friendly fire perk under charisma and the shiskebab. the amount healed is related to the perk level not the weapon damage. so either a noturnal of bloodied, makes no difference. faster swing speed helps a lot though.
---
I've been using an exploding, 30% Scorched, 90% less weight Handmade since level 50, so about 53 levels of it being a beast. 
---
Yesterday I got a 1 star Quad Ammo Handmade...
---
The 80 round clip beats out the exploding rounds easy! I won't miss the extra damage to Scorched or the lowered carry weight as much as I hated reloading constantly. 
---
Never thought I'd be trading in my 3 star exploding handmade for a 1 star but here we are. lol
---
"Full health explosive shotgunner?"
---
Get a load of this guy... +1 upvote and a "Wearing is Caring" thingy...
---
Most people are pretty nice in 76, on PC at least (I don't have experience with the console communities). There's the chance of running into shitheads but you're far more likely to run into someone more than 100 levels above you who just dumps free gifts on you
---
With the gold bullion SH plans, the plants will pop through any paint skin.  If you use a 50cal, a skin is almost necessary on the arms (the left arm blocks 1/3 of the screen in 1st person without it).
---
I use the plague rider paint, because it matches the plants.
---
PA heavy gunner w/BFFR gatling plasma. Looking to go sneaky unyielding fixer build.
---
Just click play, worst that happens is you'll encounter some mobs that are higher level than you. Best that happens is you'll encounter another player and emote wave and get a wave back.
---
&gt;yeah i posted about the same issue a few days ago and got no solution sadly.  it's not a "game breaking" bug so sadly I don't think bethesda will do anything about it considering how long i's been an issue and the number of updates we've had since it started happening with no fix or even a single mention of it by the devs as far as i know.  but if you do somehow find a solution i would love to know it as well.
---
My instructions were completely clear.
---
Kinda late man.. you got 48 hours
---
Contrary to lots of reports, it's very very very rare to lose your stored stash anymore (that bug where other people could buy your stash stuff off of your vendor is essentially gone), no one is going to trash your camp, and you can't really be owned by higher levels. PVP in Adventure mode is essentially dead and non-existent. 
---
If anything, players are going to be wanting to help you more than anything. Fallout 76 is one of the most friendly and welcoming player communities in any MMO-type game I've ever played.
---
Just play open world Adventure mode. You have nothing to lose and all to gain.
---
Same here, xbox.
---
I've played since better and the other day I switched to my lower level to play on, joined a team with 3 players all over 250, they started dropping stuff for me, chems, ammo, etc. I had to group message saying I'm not new but appreciate it. Most ppl are nice, a minority of ppl are dicks but it's the same for most online games.
---
Agreed. Got lots of friends and Family into it once it hit Gamepass on Xbox and half of them have already decreased their play time due to always being over encumbered or have no space left.
---
Also the reasons you stated don't really happen unless you want them too. There's no current bugs to lose your stash (that I know of(and even when they existed I never lost my stash)) and they cant kill you unless you shoot them back. The vast majority are nice to each other, especially if you're a lower level. If you encounter a dick, just server hop and they'll be gone.
---
Don't use the new vault Tec camp skin from the legendary run it causes it. Just moved my camp and put my Raider camp skin one back on and my allies move and everything now.
---
Yes, yes it does, it’s even written on the gun, but you probably know that hehe
---
TBF, if I could find a legendary Staff. I’d use it. It actually has a higher DPS than the Sledge.
---
I do have an Action Hero I use occasionally, but have been doing more heavy energy weapons lately. Good to know though, thank you.
---
Fo4 is far and away the better RPG, but 76 is a better looter/shooter.  I’ve grown to love the faster pace and lack of talking to NPCs constantly.
---
You can craft legendary dc gauntlets?
---
FYI there's a power armor clip that if you can set up (needs specific geometry) is a lot more reliable
---
Today I explored Vault 79. Like *really explored*. Got my nasty lil finger prints all over the Vault gold that's been taunting me every time I go to buy a new SS armor plan
---
Though, I'm sure the OP, and most of players don't care about the game having a server, they care about their character data, that will be permanently lost once the servers get shut down. (given of course, they won't let us download our data)
---
We used to block everyone while we are alone in the open world without friends online, even my friends do here, I still block the others so they don't know where you are until we got fallout1st.
---
Yes yes and yes, please add Bethesda
---
Not gone for now, maybe on PTS? Hopefully in patch 22 so
---
I play on the PS4 so I don’t think they work on there.
---
Ooo, and the radio station has very unique songs different to what song genres we are used to, like it uses sounds from mining tools, vehicles and minecarts
---
ah yeah, me dumb this morning
---
So someone killed you without tagging for pvp. Were you wanted?
---
If you kill a crab someone is getting kinky with is that a crock block
---
B/25/25 Fixer chuckled at this.
---
It's funny how deep the vault room really is and it's just one big box.
---
Workshop Griefing.. workshops are PVP so you cant really expect not to get gangked... most of us arnt dickskins and will actually help defend it. Also.. if you crouch people wont see you on the map. They more then likely "saw" your were at the workshop then decided to jingle your bells. Invest in Home Defense, when the new Patch hits turrets will get upgraded. If you defend the workshop properly mist griefers shouldnt be a problem.
---
c'est la vie
---
its not so bad after you've played your 3rd or 4th MMO that shuts down. Usually you have a few years of knowing its coming.
---
City of Heroes devs were kinda dicks about it though
---
"loosing stored stash, having my camp trashed, just being Owned by a higher level."
---
None of these thing should happen on console, if you play with passive mode, and stay out of workshops, other then some very rare bugs. 
---
On pc more stuff can happen, but I would still think it would be very rare.
---
Shoot On Sight policy
---
Cranberry relich is +25% xp in teams for 1h. Its worth it and easy to do. Edit : with herbivore of course
---
I feel you. If 3 people would do it, done, all 100 can be deposited whenever and you get full benefit. I always collect my 40, and then some if I have to. I typically turn in 20 or so, so some of the ore will respawn. Then I can dump the rest at the end or whenever it seems like people can handle the spawns.
---
I’ve played on and off since beta on xbox, have met mostly (almost totally) nice and friendly peeps in game. 
---
Is no need to worry about losing stuff from your stash or scrap box, nobody can take anything from them. 
---
Make sure you have pacifist mode on, and if anyone tries to pvp or attacks then just ignore them, they will lose interest quickly.. just don’t engage in pvp and is no chance of getting wrecked.
---
As for your camp, I don’t think anyone can wreck it, unless it is nuked, so that is more likely if your camp is in a popular nuke location, so just gotta keep an eye open if it is and leave server to protect your camp. As for players trashing your camp, pretty sure this can only happen if you’re engaged in pvp with someone but maybe someone else can confirm exactly... like I said, never had problem with this.
---
Are you on Pc?  The ultra-duped lvl 45 b/e/a handmade is even more common than the b/25/25 and b/e/15 fixers, or at least has been around since Jan 2019.
---
Just make fo76 singleplayer/co-op free and make it client sided, using their storage instead, simple
---
🙄
---
The problem is with legendary perks you'll see more and more people crafting ammo rather than buying it
---
Nope. Not wanted, no Workshop. Nothing.
---
Which is why I was so surprised.
---
Well, they did. Provided u pay a monthly subscription...
---
You should get that cough sorted out
---
**Food. Get in my B E L L Y.**
---
Did you choose to go on a world that wouldn't allow your camp to be placed? Sometimes it can reset your vending/displays by doing so.
---
I would also like to know how to do this
---
Ive had my camp setup at the junkpile near Alpine River Cabins since forever... so creepy sounds dont bug me much... The atmosphere in the mire unsettles me though
---
thanks for the offer man but im on pc
---
I have this to but as far as I know, I dont have this skin. I did however buy some single intems from it, a plushie I think, can that be doing it?
---
What build are you running?
---
It depends on your build and playing style. If you love certain weapons, you gotta create a build that would compliment them.
---
Story time:
---
I had horrible experiences on my main last year, every time I'd try to be a conduit I'd burn through too many stims and still end up failing. 
---
So when I came back 3 months ago and made an alt... I avoided Encryptid like the plague. 
---
Cue to the end of the SCORE run, I have no dailies so I decide to finish up some Possum badges. For Electrician I have to be a conduit for 60 seconds. So I start looking for the event. 
---
Weeks go by, literal weeks go by with it never starting. I'm half debating running the chain myself but still not really wanting to do it. 
---
So the other day when I was standing in camp bored and I saw it pop up I actually got excited. I checked and saw that 2 level 200+ were already there, so I figured we'd stand a good chance (I'm 106) so I joined. 
---
Get there and they're just standing around waiting for more. I take position near a conduit and wait. A few minutes go by when the Death from Above message appears. 
---
Out of habit I checked, just curious if it was Earle or the Queen. My eyes widened as I saw the blast zone encircling us! Some troll had decided to nuke us before we could even start the event!
---
I do the angry emote and the thumbs down, notice that the others are reluctantly running towards the edge so I join them. 
---
When the nuke timer hit 1 minute, someone started the Encryptid event... Only now does it start to dawn on me this isn't someone trolling. 
---
Sure enough I turn around and there is the player that launched the nuke. A level 556. The message to defeat the Imposter appeared practically at the same time the nuke hit. The event completes without even seeing the beast!
---
I was simultaneously impressed and disappointed. Was cool to complete it so easily, but I wasn't able to earn the credits towards the badge that I actually wanted. 
---
It's been 3 days since then and as expected... no Encryptid events to be seen on any server.
---
Happened to me the other day. They say it may be because someone was using your vending machines while you log out.
---
I have some cards that helps for shotgun (I forgot to mention I've enjoyed the shotguns), otherwise my build is very much focused on strenght, charisma and being a medic / chemist.
---
I guess my "build" has been a bit of this and that, not really favouring a special bad ass weapon.
---
The jerks are rare, but if you run into one of them, remember:  you're in control of that game's interface.   You can server hop.  If worse comes to worse, you can turn off the console.   I've played 1800+ hrs, and really only had to server hop twice.
---
I'll get on the drums till the event is over. 
---
*plays porn synth on the drums.. somehow
---
I just tried to put all of my weapons on the wall again and they went back to my stash.
---
yeah, but I hop all day and I've never had this happen before.
---
I did crash when someone bought something, maybe this happened?
---
To make room I removed the turrets as they are useless. I put my garden from an inside garden away from NPCs to the roof under a dome. In the last few days dome has been destroyed and so have plants. Am I really loosing my mind or do NPCS go after plants?
---
Was you part of a team? Someone engaged a pvp with one teammate, it starts a pvp with everyone joined that team...
---
Cause ammo is to expensive.
---
They bought them before, but not as much as theyre buying now.. figures are out there somewhere but my best guess is theyve atleast trippled.
---
I say heavy guns, you have the strength stat for it and can swap to melee and exploaives if you get bored
---
You should go home too if your mad
---
This happen to me plus everything I had locks on came unlocked I had to destroy the item and make new ones :( and re-lock things
---
I was on a public team yes, but I thought they’d changed the way that works so that everyone needs to be tagged individually?
---
There Is not a timer, Smiley's bullion reset every monday
---
The scrap box only store components, which are somehow 30 fixed objectreferences in term of game data.
---
I have mixed experiences with this.
---
Sometimes I'm the only one, other times there's 3 - 4 of us.
---
My issue at the moment is I'm loaded down with legendaries &amp; become overencumbered after the first 2 caves so its a really slow footslog
---
\+1 on this
---
Building is the most fun part of the game and everybody would like that.  
---
I'm having tons of building materials and found a bunch of very interesting locations where I would love to start building a new camp.
---
Hey im hungry, and that stupud robot destroyed the cake, give me that sweetroll old lady palma gave you
---
Then there would be no flora to collect. So I would not like this idea.
---
Switch on passive mode for a start.  One has ever tried to kill me.
---
Actually i had missed that part completely, my bad. But still it takes a limited legendary perk card spot that would be way more beneficial to fill with something else that works 100% of the time, not just once in awhile (rarely). Especially on higher levels when you have perk coins to upgrade your cards.
---
Nope
---
Nope, but maybe some of your Charisma got lost? 
---
Herd mentality w/o a group? Better Bargain not equipped?
---
That absolutely unrealistic. A nuke produces radiation...thats how they work. 
---
Pls try not to post so many "far off" ideas..good ones drown in all that "i want this andi want that"
---
Same thing with the assaultrons..everyones complaining because theyre so hard to kill (first of all theyre not hard to kill) and theyre supposed to be a strong enemy. (Pro tip on that dont run bloodied builds and youre fine)
---
Love those. Currently playing with a matched set of 33/25 Handmade and Fixer.
---
Been looking for an AAE 50 CAL for ages.
---
Iirc the ammount of items in containers just affect the loading time of location when fast travelling/loading in. For example, in Skyrim, usually it takes much longer to fast travel to a location that's your house due to the ammount of items you have stored. I would be fine with loading in a little longer in exchange for increased stash space, but considering its not only one space and a lot of people have the same stashes, the servers are going to break in half.
---
I’d love a ‘That Gun’ skin too
---
Most people are at Radiation Rumble only to farm XP and ghoul loot. And frankly, with Legendary Perk Cards and the new season coming in two days, this is sadly going to stay that way unless Bethesda changes the event so the ghouls give substantially less XP (e.g. like the robots in the missile silos).
---
Robert Johnson you say? Are the mutant hounds standing in for the hell hounds chasing you?
---
I thought that, too! Maybe it's coming with the next update...
---
This is essentially just a more in depth version of what I said.
---
Mole miners can actually speak, they are just crazy and have a filter. You can hear some "I'LL RIP YOU IN HALF" and other shit when they're attacking you.
---
Honestly i'd love a talk show where named NPCs are invited and the host has to try to stay professional while graham breaks his chair and murmurgh screams into the microphone
---
Yeah thinking assaultrons are hard to kill is early game problems. 
---
Once youve progressed far enough, i was only level 70, and im was farming assaultrons with my farm build. Shotgun to the legs drops them. Ez pickings. Only tough part is trying to kill them before they self destruct if they decide thats the only way out.
---
Sounds to me like you gotta start looking into builds or at least pick a type of weapon and start getting the perks to make that type as good as possible.
---
For instance if you wanted to use rifles, you generally want all 9 rifleman perks (in the perception tree) minimum, and then bonus complimentary perks like Tank Killer to up your damage potential further.
---
It’s not so much the type of weapon as your perk setup that makes it work.
---
I've empath on and you can really feel it. I find it really funny when someone kicks me from a team and they starting to get 33% more damage! I've 1 charasima so that could be a reason that I get kicked sometimes. But yeah people with empath should be highlighted same with the comming legendary perks
---
No atom cost to level, but it is said additional points can be brought from atom shops. All my information is pretty old since no one recently show a video of latest PTS. Sorry for obsolete information.
---
It a good idea! I know the single action revolver is not very powerful but as of right now it has only one skin and I think Bethesda should support and implement all weapons
---
If my turrets had ever fired on the traveling merchant, I would have never scraped them. She annoys me, she comes into my camp touches my stuff, opens doors, gets in my way at the stove or workbenches, and doesn’t have anything I want to buy.
---
The season has finished therefore you can’t get score anymore
---
Turn this into GTA radio and have tons of weird radio channels. I always loved radio in GTA games. Great music and tons of funny and weird announcers. They could have:
---
A blood eagle channel
---
A mothman channel
---
A cultist channel 
---
A ghoul channel
---
....an Earle channel
---
SCORE was ended last week, but you can still get Ammo converter via gold bullion vendor after patch 22 arrived on next Tuesday
---
Lol 🤣 your camp is amazing mate ✌️
---
To be honest the PVP bit doesn’t really bother me, I went through the days where PVP was a hopeless free for all. 
---
The chicken shitness of this does bug me though, and the disconnect feels a bit too coincidental.
---
Anyway, more important things in life to worry about and if I come across them again one day, I’ll just nuke their camp :)
---
Season 1 is over. Season 2 starts on the 15th. I do belive those items will be available to buy with gold bullions later.
---
You might be in luck, apparently some of the items on the board will be available to buy in game with bullion but with you saying your a new player I'm guessing you havnt done the wastelander questline yet so you might be in for a long wait if it's still available by then
---
Id love an offline mode, or even the 8 player limit on private servers, with base building, larger camps, unlimited stash...
---
This game is, according to Todd, supposed to last for 5 years. That's the expected life cycle of an online game. However, GTA is going on 7, and still online.
---
I’m a bloodied build and I’ll still chuck on my stealth suit if I need to
---
Your right, I guess you’ll have to crawl out of the basement and check out the IRL sunset.
---
If the BoS dlc adds new bullion items, a 1911 service pistol would be a natural fit.  If it’s really good, even better.
---
A beefed up legendary BoS recon rifle or anti materiel rifle would also be much appreciated.  It might help to give riflemen an option other that the gauss rifle after p22.
---
Your choice, but I'll leave you with this, posted by DerGudy a few months back.
---
&gt;The  protection provided by DR/ERR/RR depends on the ratio between the  resistance and the incoming damage. If the damage is equal to the  resistance, it gets halved. Lower damage than the resistance is reduced  more while higher damage is reduced less, but the relationship is not  linear. There is a damage calculator [here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/omgvlac2ux) if you want to play around with the numbers yourself.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Now,  very, very few things in this game can deal more than 200 damage on a  single hit. So let's take this as a reasonable cut-off and start with  300 DR, which is more or less easily obtainable with good armor and some  perks and/or mutations. 300 DR reduces an incoming 200 damage hit to  about 88 actual damage. At 350 it's about 83 and at 400 it's about 78.  At 450 DR it's 75 and at 550 DR you're looking at 70 damage. So you've  almost doubled DR and got the damage reduction from 56% up to 65%. Big  deal.  
---
&gt;Now let's look at damage  reduction. 15% damage reduction, e.g. from a piece of mob-type specific  legendary armor like Zealot's, gets that 200 incoming damage to 170,  which your 300 DR armor reduces further to 70. So the 15% damage  reduction did the same job as adding 250 more DR. A full Vanguard set  adds 175 DR at maximum health, by the way.  
---
&gt;The reason power armor is so good? Built-in up-front 42% damage reduction and 90% radiation reduction (7% and 15% per piece).  
---
&gt;TL;DR: Beyond around 300 DR/ER, it's much better to invest into damage reduction instead of more DR/ER.
---
So long as I can become an enemy of the BoS and continually harass and kill them every chance I get, I'm all for it.
---
If you move your camp device in edit mode, you can adjust where the spawn point is. After I build my camp I move the camp device to different locations with in the build area and fast travel to my camp. If I’m not happy with were I spawn I adjust the location of my camp device until I spawn in a place I’m happy with. At my current camp my visitors ( and myself) spawn directly in front of my front door about 100 feet out.
---
The division 2 has some great features tbh. I also think some would work good in 76. Even the DZ tbh.
---
&gt; "To further enhance protection against direct contact with and contamination by radioactive, biological or chemical substances, the armor can be made airtight, allowing its operator to explore even the most contaminated areas with reasonable safety as long as the armor is not compromised.[13] The helmet is an integral part of this protection, fitted with a rubberized cowl mounted to the chest plate and providing a tight seal"

---
I used to rely completely on the pump shotgun as with a true long barrel, stinging MAG, silencer and harden receiver (excluding legendary effects) it does more damage than the combat shotgun.
---
However, the combat shotgun when having the same mods, has a faster fire rate and reloads faster as well. The damage difference compared to fire rate ends up wasting enemies quicker than the pump and the damage difference per shot isn't really that drastic...... And not having to hide in a corner while reloading is also a bonus.
---
Never bothered with the double barrel.
---
I have a two shot combat, and two other legendaries I can't recall at the moment. I also have one Perk card maxed for the shotgun damage..... I thought about perking up another card, but seeing as how with my sneak bonuses, I waste just about anything in two hits Max, I have had no need.
---
Once the SBQ lands and I get up close, a full stinging MAG clip usually wipes it out really fast.
---
Added: oh, the other two legendaries is increased damage per consecutive hit and extra limb damage.
---
Thank you! Yours super awesome as well. How did you make it float like that?
---
Regardless of how the plans were obtained, it was still kind of the person to leave a bag of gifts.
---
If it would essentially be a torso mod where you’d choose it instead of a jet pack or emergency protocols I suppose it would make sense.
---
I collected the ores, and be down thumbed because I ended the event before the time ran out.
---
its not true. They refund stuff...
---
My guess would be that it's not intended. It's probably coded that AP usage leads to fusion core drain and they forgot about VATS using AP too.
---
Wow so are you saying as long as some coders go in there and rewrite the read write capabilities for inventory we can finally modav carryweight 100k ?!
---
tbh most of the perks are boring as hell
---
you could just get the fissure site in the blast radius, it does not need to be a direct hit to trigger the event. same deal with ACP
---
If you deliberately put the rally site in the nuke zone you can get more legendaries. Nuked areas have a higher chance of producing legendaries. The primary reason for keeping the rally site out of the nuke zone is to encourage unyielding players to participate in the fight.
---
Enemies have different damage resistances that you aren't taking into account. The math is overly complicated and more trouble than I cared to dive into.
---
Disintegrator was awesome indeed
---
My advice is don’t change your build until after patch 22 because there will be a hell of a lot of changes to the game, builds and weapon meta.. just wait a few days after the update and research the changes, there will be a lot of people play testing and giving results on here and YouTube so just wait a while.. in the meantime if you want a quick kill weapon to help you level up and gain some perk points for when you do change your build then ANY shotgun with either the limb damage, bashing damage or 33% vats hit chance legendary effect will one shot everything except world bosses the trick is that you HAVE to use VATS to shoot them for it to work, if you don’t use vats it won’t work. The best shotgun would be a combat.. then a pump action. Try to add a hardened receiver to it if you can as it will help give more damage to guarantee the one hit kill. The best legendary effect would be instigating.. again to guarantee the one shot kill, another is two shot but again this isn’t a must.. just as long as you have one of those legendary effects I mentioned above. It should be easy to find a shotgun in a vendor with these effects as they drop very consistently. If however you can’t find one then if you have 1 piece of armor with the 15% damage while blocking effect then equip this and you can use any shotgun even if it’s just one you have crafted.. doesn’t even need to be legendary. It just helps if you have a higher damage shotty is all just to make sure of the one shot kill. But even with the standard crafted shotty with the armor should be ok. You do not need shotgunner perks either, although if you have any already without spending points then by all means use them. After the update I still think that sneak commando is going to be the best build for all round gameplay. Hope this helps you
---
They already have 3,000 different instances of crap like that though and keep piling more on so it's just unnessary. Some games are satisfied with just having a player log in, period, for a daily reward... then they can log off without doing anything else if they wanted. The game gets their active account traffic numbers just from that. They don't need you to login and do 6000 different daily chores.
---
Then ofc there's always the "just make a good game" solution that others have done to where they don't even need dailies. Which is my personal favorite.
---
If your infos are pretty old you should refrain from telling them,then. You pretty much got it all wrong.
---
It's tricky and kind of hard to explain in text. You pretty much just have to keep messing with it until you figure it out. 
---
You can stack the large stairs with columns, but I've found it easiest to have them on opposite sides of each other instead. 
---
Best tip I have is to stack the stairs *before* you place the flooring. You can get the columns to snap together easier that way... occasionally. 
---
Like I said, with camp building in this game you pretty much just have to fuss with it until it decides to magically work.
---
They should just add a toggle to every underarmor. If it's on it will override your character cosmetic and be underarmor + outfit. If its off it's just an underarmor.
---
Why not ask for something that would make everyone happy, like the ability to change underarmors into outfits at workbenches, rather than something that will once again break people's equipment and waste their flux?
---
I would exchange tokens representing my labor for this with a big smile on my face!
---
This isn’t an actual survival game. You aren’t in much danger of other players killing you
---
Stick a couple of scarecrows around your garden plot, the creatures will attack those and not your plants. The only times I've had to deal with destroyed plants is when the enemies start lobbing in explosives.
---
I've also taken to setting down a foundation, putting a half wall on that and then a roof and then putting a few turrets on that, it gives is a lower angle(so the turrets have a better chance to "see" the enemies attacking your structures) while at the same time raises it off the ground so that the enemies can't simply run up to it and destroy it. It's not 100% but I haven't had to deal with broken turrets nearly as much since I've started doing it that way.
---
I also use the green port-a-potties as a base for my turrets.
---
For some reason? I’m surprised it isn’t longer considering how many people were bitching about how burned out they were from having to login every day to do dailies. I was kind of hoping for like a month off So I could at least finish my reputation grind before I have another set of dailies to do.
---
Maybe someone on your team was sharing hard bargain, or something in your loadout changed. (Perk, mutation, special stat allocation, etc).
---
There was a post asking for That gun to come in using 5.56 which I would love but we can all dream
---
Well then again diseases aren't really that harmful.
---
I'm on Xbox and I have had three maybe four bad interactions with other players in the nearly two years I've been playing. 
---
I'm assuming you're a FO1st player, so you have unlimited scrap storage so rebuilding a camp becomes a non-issue if you horde scrap like me. If you're worried about players aggroing you to steal your stash then utilise your survival tent more, set it up before going into an area or near a building so as soon as you're out you can offload your junk. 
---
Play in pacifist mode and immediately fast travel away. in patch 22 foundation, crater as well as vault 76 are all free fast travel points.
---
I split my play 80/20 between private and adventure servers. Private so I can take workshops to generate resources and adventure for events and trading   
---
Remember there are many more decent players out there than there are idiots, it may seem like there are more idiots playing from the popular discussions on r/fo76. However, I think it's down to the decent players enjoy discussing idiotic behaviour and coming up with solutions to combat it. 
---
You can block players who are griefing you and finally you can log off and jump on to another server.
---
At a minimum they will be backwards compatible and still able to play
---
Assuming youre on about the pip boy flashlight you can change that in the ini files if you play on pc, no dice on console unfortunately
---
The real question is what are you planning on doing with that tiny shovel strapped to the ghillie backpack?
---
I completely agree. Fallout 76 is just full of so many bright colors, pop ups and goofy sound effects and game-play elements already that adding things like the Interloper or magic monsters just really takes away what I loved about Fallout 1-3's vibe.
---
If you want a backpack with mods then you shouldn't be allowed calibrated shocks at the same time.
---
Sorry boys, Chally don't eat da meat
---
Johnny guitar
---
Yeah, this has been posted like 1000x before.
---
Would be good, but highly doubt it.
---
I just did my 5 for the archeologist badge, not really sure they are worth digging up based on what i received.  My other maps will sit in inventory until some kind of non treasure reason to dig them up.
---
Also not really sure how you sre supposed to find the area without googling. Feel like it should give you a big area circle to at least have a general idea of where to start matching with the drawing.
---
I am doing the quest, but don’t know anything about these bullions yet (might have to set to English ;) ) anyway, is it tradable? Or I just have to hope it will stay buyable?
---
Why whats happening over there?
---
We been asking for that since the beginning, they don't care.
---
The best we got is the 'Save Everything' mod.
---
I wasn’t disagreeing with you. But what I added was different to what you said. It wasn’t more in depth just written from a cynical business perspective, giving rise to Bethesda’s motive ( traffic numbers ), rather than apathetic game evolution as you were suggesting. Basically it may have been what you meant but not what you wrote.
---
While you were away your game copy was touched by the finger of Todd. Blessed be his name.
---
How do i upvote twice?
---
No its not.... It frees 2 spécial points freely which requires either 2 legendary perk slot to get it for free or 1 slot and whatever perk coin you need to upgrade to rank 2.
---
In that case, its clearly better to take the infiltrator perk.
---
And its mandatory if you want to do silos runs with less than 3 points in perception. And I wont take conditionnal/bad perks jusg to keep 3 perception, and glowing sight is one of them.
---
Dude this happened for the first time for me. I just found a package in my room. With 100+ plans including duplicates of up to 6 and like 50/50 rads and stims and so much booze,  I literally just emptied my own stash to 640 and this stuff put it to 790 lol. I learned the plans graciously, emptied like 10 of rads and stims into my stash a little booze too. I took the rest of everything to a low-level camp near me and dropped a package. No way I could keep it. I appreciate it muchly though. All about paying it forward.
---
Wish they would add more there really is only one good station and its very limited :(
---
It's straight bullshit, but Bethesda knows that removing the limits would kill the game.  So they pretend there is no issue and stay radio silent smfh...
---
There is a 24/7 fallout radio channel on YouTube you could check out.
---
Yeah, I play on an Xbox One S  and the graphics suck. Blinding light sucks. I never understood why its said " Fallout 76 has better graphics "
---
Will it be buyable for limited time or wil it stay, I might be tor welt to get those bullions , oh and is it tradable in any way?
---
AR Fan Here :)
---
For me the AR is the real AK47 of the wasteland. Ubiquitous, cheap, easy to mod. Looks the part as well and not many people use it.
---
Getting a good one like FFR , faster reload, reduced ap etc seems much easier and way cheaper from vendors than for Handmades (very rare) or Fixers (never) and with the right magazine and other mods reloading is a blur and recoil is almost non existent. Being cheap it’s possible to get a few with different legendary effects and play around with mods to see what works best . 
---
It’s just enjoyable to use.
---
Maxing absolute DPS is not something I worry about too much as long as i can contribute fairly effectively in boss fights, clear a few mobs, and revive the people who actually are doing max damage a few times :)
---
Also , the best weapon is the one you have :)
---
You can do both faction's quest lines simultaneously up until the very end. I believe the game will warn you when you're about to reach the point of no return, although it's been a while since I've done it. Feel free to play both sides and gather all of the quest rewards until the actual end quest.
---
After you finish the quest line you'll have to raise your reputation with both sides with repeatable quests to unlock other faction rewards with gold bullion.
---
I am aware of that but bloodied will be affected much more than builds that don’t stack so many perks :)
---
Certainly not me, since I can't move in a stealth/hazmat suit cuz I need the weight increase my armor +unyielding gives and get overcuccumbered. Rather get the xp/leg lewt, especially with it's forced importance with seasons. My build is complete and used to not care about xp. So blame the game's design, not the players.
---
I’ll be happy I’ll switch back to my main build but will still be able to sit around the camp fire in a few years time and talk about how it used to be in the olden days :)
---
Why not? regular armor can get everything at the same time, plus a number of powerful or QoL Legendary effects.
---
Burried with honor 😉 It‘s not really immersive looking for a shovel nearby if you carry one on your backpack.
---
Yeah. I think I replied to your earlier post. Still can't completely fix it. It comes and goes.
---
Yeah I noticed this  it’s a pity that legendary scrip has really affected the vendor market for weapons
---
People really need to collect their thoughts before posting something like this. I'm pretty sure devs don't take any of our suggestions seriously at this point
---
I think pistol don't have enough support in 76, I hope that with update 22 the don't nerf them
---
You clearly haven't done the vault 94 raids otherwise you'd realise how easy you're all getting the SH.
---
Same for me. Problem I think is that the event does spawn a few three star legendaries, so they wait for those and ignore the ore. 
---
Still, I rarely do it because typically it's just me and one other person collecting.
---
There is a disease cure camp item coming 
---
Although i agree, power armour should be buffed in this regard. I don’t know why it does not have legendary effects like batteries included or thru hiker attached to it either, there was a time where i could carry so much stuff and then when i jumped into power armour with the carry weight mod i would suddenly be 100 overweight.
---
Buying weapons from her is 99.9% guaranteed to bring about feelings of regret ..  out of principle I just stack legendary modules in the hope Bethesda gives us other ways to use them in the future
---
No, not limited.
---
No, not tradable.
---
I wish they'd turn modules into currency like the Gold B'z instead of them taking up weight too. I can't even use my scrip anymore most of the time cuz I'm not crafting stuff constantly cuz everythings just too damn heavy but I get loadsaweight used up anyways when the modules stack up enough.
---
It will stay, and you would be able to buy It easily, but once you have completed the wasteland main quest you may want to buy a set of armor first. Just enjoy the ride. And if you're on PC I can give you some ammo and supplies.
---
76er's should be the Boomers, our bombs and guns are way better than those west coast clowns, lol.
---
They haven’t said if it’s limited time (so probably not), and no gold bullion items can’t be traded.
---
Devs don't take their own suggestions seriously at this point. They're working on Starfield.
---
On the helmet?
---
This would be awesome! Would be cool if the random spawns of settlers and raiders etc unlocked them, another thing to collect
---
 If I get dollar every time someone make post about limit bad I will be fucking rich who is gonna post about limit bad tomorrow can you tell me
---
And unbend the ski sword pleaseeeee. Black diamond has literally gotten me through so much without having to extend weapon con. And ammo. I cant wait to find a stronger sword.
---
I love the animation of the Powerfist :D It makes me feel like a Marvel superhero.
---
MY B/DCG is still the one though. Are there any skins for that?
---
It's just a game buddy. Go play it. This is easily the best gaming community in history. I've yet to run into more than a handful of assholes.
---
I mean we essentially said the same thing, you just gave a more in depth analysis of why. Same play pattern, more reasons. This isn't a one or the other situation, and my explanation wasn't apathetic, it was also business driven. The end goal is more money in beth's pocket and higher number player base.
---
A vending machine vendor, so a vending machine stocked with.... vending machines?
---
Would those ALSO be stocked with vending machines?
---
Maybe you should do your research before talking about something it will be you know great
---
They got rid of explosive energy weapons dropping a long time ago so they are now known as Legacy weapons. And way back when they nerfed explosive rounds it didn’t include the legacy explosive energy weapons.
---
I mean since you have to pay for online on consoles it should remain up indefinitely on console, and pc can probably make modded servers pretty easy
---
I've played the game on 4 different platforms, xbox one, xbox one x, a desktop and now my laptop. Never have I experienced lag from a tesla rifle. I've had lag from cheater turning hordes of scorched into mist from modded weapons. Maybe it does lag for some people but I'm not changing my play style on the off chance one of those people are within distance. A tesla rifle is often times the only way to tag mobs since most people run a one shot bloodied build so good luck spotting the legendary in a crowd before it dies.
---
These are legacy weapons that are no longer obtainable in-game. Energy weapons with Explosiv effect should never exist and so they got removed from the regular loot pool in this game. The only way to get one is via trading with another player. And, because it's a legacy weapons, it will cost you some really good items to get one.
---
Btw. Respect that a someone gave his legacy into your hand just for testing lol. Never heard of something like that haha :D
---
Same
---
ive also noticed that if shutters remain closed, wallpaper will stay but if you log off with shutters open theres a chance wallpaper will be gone when you return. some walls do it more than others 🤔
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Putting a gold press at all the train stations would make sense and be a lot easier. I mean they had an atom shop link at all the stations before and this would be way more convenient.I have over 500 bullion to cash in, keep forgetting 😭
---
Vote this shit up!!!!

Never skip LegPerk day, bruh.

When did the change occur? I had BOTH types of fatigues the day before yesterday... Outfits and shielded under armor... they appear almost identical in the pip-boy.

If you’re enjoying shotguns you should try to invest in the perk cards for them to maximise damage. I read some comments earlier that discussed shotguns a bit -

There should be a challenge that after completing a certain number of treasure maps it rewards you with a pirate hat

Yes, please bros

Well it's gonna be a Bethesda game  but fuck, it's gonna be a Bethesda game......
---
You win some you lose some.
---
Can you explain exactly how it does work then? I'd be interested in seeing a proper explanation and testing method.
---
I think the graphics are somehow worse than 4, everything looks washed out , foliage looks straight outta PS2 etc. The new rendering and lighting Todd was carrying on about at E3 seems to be a bit of a dud, don't even get me started on 16x the details lol
---
Very good idea, are you suggesting a price difference for lower levels at the ammunition dispensary? or just lower prices all around. At Max caps I still won't buy from the ammunition dispensary unless I'm desperate
---
I think bethesda made workshops pvp so one players couldn't hog them and that dynamic has  always been a part of the game. Unfortunately if you want to keep all the workshops you claim you will need fo1st.
---
All hail Todd
---
Whenever my main has weight reducing perks, and is carrying a lot of inventory, the frame rate drops so low I can barely make it  to a vendor to sell off the inventory.  Its gotten so bad I hesitate to use weight reducing perks now.  I am not talking about moving super slow when you exceed 800 lbs. I am specifically referring to frame rate. Does this happen to others?  Funny thing is though it doesn't happen to my Alt.
---
Is colossal problem limited time?

---
Woah now. Let's not get crazy. We are all children in Todd's eyes, and children need strict limits.
---
And 80% of that is a load screen. The only game that I am thrilled when I can be online for the shortest time possible.
---
You need to ask this question after the patch on Tuesday, a whole lot of people are going to swap out their builds and bitch about it :-)
---
I've noticed sometimes when I log in, the game will suddenly look a bit better. Like it's a tad less grainy with a better resolution or something. Definitely enough of a difference to be noticeable.
---
How do you know if a weapon is legendary I'm 40 and I still don't get so much

Because you are not using them that doesn't mean there are enough weapons there are lots of weapons you just use same weapon all of the time
---
That I’m not sure about. But a quick-stim fixes that and I carry so many it’s not really an issue.
---
I actually didn’t know Bird Bones was supposed to increase limb damage.
---
Gonna try this. I have the same issue you had.
---
I’m noticing he seems to jump to answer quickly but doesn’t have a great ‘accuracy rating’
---
SBs outta fucking nowhere then ghouls now your shit is rekt
---
Gauss minigun can has a smaller  explosive effect. You can purchase plans with gold from the raiders.
---
WRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
---
I speak mole miner, so this is a great idea.
---
I do know enemies target scarecrows. Put a scarecrow down and they should attack it instead.
---
It's much more severe when you have a crazy slow per shot time. If first hit misses with a bow and the enemy is running away. You don't get to do the second hit before you fall out of vats as they go behind something.
---
The implication of what you wrote was that the game launched with no end game &amp; hope &amp; prayer were mentioned, this implies apathetic game evolution, as if Bethesda were thinking “no plan let us just see what evolves”. I’m saying the game is designed from day one to get more bang for their buck. They knew about the weight issues prior to release, it is almost a mirror copy of what they got away with in ESO. 
---
You didn’t mention player base or money in your original comment. 
---
Your comment to me made me feel like “why did you bother, when I said exactly that”. When I read you original comment, you didn’t say that, hence my continuing to reply.
---
Again my answer was no more “in depth”, you wrote from an equally in depth, playability ,game evolution point of view, I wrote (cynical?) business point of view. Yes they are both valid, no they are not the same.
---
Out of interest - to my mind the purveyor was always there (used to be based at a train station near Watoga, now a ruin but “bots on parade” still runs there). I think they moved it to the Rusty Pick because the original site was a bit “hot” for low level players. I could be wrong &amp; I’ll be happy to be corrected.
---
Play through both sides until u have no more quests and have to choose a side. Make sure to get the chinese stealth armour. Which side u pick doesn’t massively matter and I’d advise being selfish when the time comes. You’ll see what I mean when u get there
---
Just because YOU couldn't does not mean that other couldn't.
---
I'm a pretty casual player and normally I run a variation of the lazy shotgunner build, so for the SBQ event to feel like I'm at least helping I use a 3* Zealeots Cryolator with +30 damage to scorched, 25% faster rate and 15% faster reload, on top of the heavy gunner perks I also have;
---
• Lock and load (2 stars).
---
• Demolition expert (5 stars) I was surprised to find it's an explosive weapon!
---
• Batteries included (2 stars),  because the ammo counts as energy ammo.
---
• Gunsmith (3 stars), the Cryolator isn't the most robust gun and a repair kit or two will help as well. 
---
• Bloody mess (3 star).
---
• Grim reaper's sprint (3 star).
---
I don't use PA but you might find Stabilised handy too.
---
Avoid using One gun army as the general consensus seems to believe the stagger effect stops the SBQ from landing and it takes longer to kill her.
---
&gt; You didn’t mention player base or money in your original comment.
---
Yes I did... lol that was the main point of the comment.
---
Whereas I am always happy to see her. I'm usually quite a bit over encumbered when I log in so welcome the opportunity to sell some stuff
---
Again, you may feel that is what you meant but it is not what you wrote. Happy to be proved wrong.
---
If what you mean is instead of either being able to sell 1 ammo for 1 cap (100 bullets = 100 caps) or giving it away for free, you could do something like a package of 10 bullets for 1 cap, then I'm in. I never buy ammo from vending machines, when it's so easy to create. However if I could buy 500 5.56, for 50 caps (100 = 10 caps), I'd probably start buying it more often than making it, and we'd get a better economy on ammo trading sorted.
---
honestly its sad that bloodied builds have such a bad name from some of the people who play them (and the hackers who almost always play them) that people pretty much see a bloodied and assume its best to let them die
---
wait till one world system the queen actually is less tanky but her minion waves are actually pretty painful to get hit by now
---
You get those  from mods for the SS armor and legendary perks when you roll.
---
Not sure what the fuss is about.  If you mod it right, roll enough times, the SS armor set ends up having better stats than excavator armor.  
---
The plus for having the SS helmet, even by itself, is the headlamp.  
---
If you don’t like the aesthetics of the SS....cover it up with your party dress or whatever your favorite RP costume is.  If you don’t like the helmet...that awesome pip boy glow is still there for you.
---
Lvl280+ i buy ammo all the time, but not when people have it listed at the ingame value, that's literally, literally,  insane, in game value needs to be 1c, with the option for 1/2c only landing on whole numbers.
---
I don't like meta characters I have nothing against them but when I game I want to simply try new things till I find that niche build for me
---
I use a team medic in power armor simply because - power armor has no stimpak animation - meaning I can double tap stims to team mates when needed while laying down a steady amount of firepower with my heavy weapons - the armor also is good since I'm wide enough to be used as a rolling shield if needed or to cover a downed player long enough for me to revive them
---
I've really enjoyed playing him as my main all this time and want to keep pushing how far I can make him unique instead of just damage dealer number 157 million
---
Except it's exactly what I wrote. Do you understand what an implication is? I directly talked about player longevity and the reasons why they want that is to keep people paying money. The rest was a direct implication that shouldn't be very hard to figure out.
---
The entire goddamn second paragraph was dedicated specifically to that.
---
&gt; They could absolutely reduce some of the caps with no negative impact on **players longevity**, but for the most part people who've set a **goal to get x kind of gear would get their goals much faster and quit playing much sooner if they did. Then beth loses potential income on atomic shop and 1st sales.**
---
Edit: Furthermore, you said "rather than apathetic game evolution as you were suggesting." Which I never suggested. The game was released as an incomplete product, that is a fact. But I didn't suggest they were apathetic, that is simply the conclusion you came to. You've ignored other facts present at the games release, simply because I didn't state them. For instance, typically game releases are big time crunches and I expect fo76 was no different since they had already set a release date. They had also already dedicated themselves to growing the game over time so they probably thought it'd be fine to release it in such a state when combined with the fact that fo is one of their most successful franchises. They were clearly wrong, as it had a tremendously negative impact on this games success and Beth's overall public image.
---
Was it originally intended to be accessible? If not, then why would they put anything in a room that players normally wouldn't be able to enter?
---
Empath needs someone else on your team for it to work
---
snap on supressor perk and friendly fire -30% damage from enemies you hit and healing them - I use a junkies flamer for in close and it saves me a lot of grief since with sharing blocker -45% melee and supressor -30% even death claws are pretty tame
---
It could be assumed they have a rebreather built into the frame. What else could those 2 tanks be? I've never heard an air compressor so they're not air tanks for a pneumatic system, and that would be an awful lot of fluid for some hyper advanced hydraulic system. Tanks for a rebreather system would make sense to me.
---
I honestly recommend team medic perk and other perks to boost team as a medic rather then the medic legendary effect 
---
that said if you ever want to get build advice from a healer player just send me a mail through the reddit mail system
---
A simple shiny Samurai sword would be awesome
---
flamers are actually cheaper to run now that more enemies drop the fuel and soon with the ammo legendary perk should be even more easy
---
Agreed!! Long time WoW player here, so can confirm what your saying, 100% true. 
---
Bank / vault space is limited AND can only be accessed from certain cities, same as auction houses. 
---
Bag space is also limited. 
---
Mail system will only keep record for 30days so you can't "stash" in your mail box. 
---
I'm paying a subscription to play WoW, and we still have 'stash' limits. Paying extra doesn't mean extra space magically appears to rectify code and stability, it is what it is for mmo's. 
---
Considering we don't have the ability to build custom camps etc in WoW is why we are able to have more people per server.  I'd say Fallout is actually doing alright when it comes to being FREE TO PLAY and in it's early years and still managing storage (which needs limitation) and custom bases.
---
Ammo factory? Like from the workshop? That was an exploit. 
---
If you mean the converter, you can buy with gold starting Tuesday.
---
The raiders also sell an ammo producer for gold with enough reputation.
---
Mine was broken like that for a couple of weeks when my friend and I were doing the mission together. Neither of us worked we got the same problem you have. After some searching online it seemed like a known issue. I just left it alone and worked on other quests. Went back and tried again a couple weeks later and it worked. My friends is still broken as of a few days ago so idk. Maybe someone on here knows the proper fix for it
---
Ah i seen a camp with an ammo factory that looks like the Lead Extractor and thought it was a camp item
---
Yeah I am on pc, thanks if you want, even some tag along when I am more capable would be great! Unfortunately don’t know anyone playing the game (coworkers ain’t gamers ;) )
---
A lot of player camps, like mine, have the ammo converter out in the open for anyone to use, until you can get the gold to buy it. Not as convenient, but better than nothing in a pinch. Your ammo points are unique to you, no matter whose converter you use.
---
I think you may be missing the point. No one is debating that the secret service armor isn’t the best combat armor in the game. Just that the helmet is over priced.
---
Lol careful all the complainers about to come out and call you “scum of the earth” if you’re referring to the exploited ammo from the workshop. Personally I could care less
---
"Console has no dupes" lol you can tell yourself that but there have been many dupes on console. Having said that I dont think there was much of a market for pumpkins
---
You need to blueprint it from the workshop. Is a bug/exploit, has its advantages, but also you can't move it nor delete it once you place it.
---
Dont worry, Sam and Dean are coming to the rescue!
---
Didnt know it was exploited honesty and not surprised that it is.
---
I'm pretty sure fast travel to foundation and crater will be free in the upcoming update. So it won't matter that much anymore.
---
I love it when I get bone worms through my power armor
---
A food canning perk, where whatever you cook gets canned and has a much longer shelf life would be awesome
---
I thought it was a dev room item but could be mistaken
---
Wanna be able to change hud colours I despise that coffee stained paper colour

I was killed too when not in PvP last week collecting razorgrain at one of the workshops on the west side of the map.  I did not claim the workshop nor did I attack anyone.  I don't think at the time the workshop was claimed by anyone.   I think there is some way to "glitch past" PvP safeguards for those wanting to Massive Douche Trolls.  I really hate MDTs! (PS4)

What about snake jazz?

They are just slacking off and taking a nap.

search the quest name and you'll find many posts with the solution

id love to be able to change the colour and shape of the light. the normal pipboy light has been almost useless for seeing shit 2 meters away since fallout 3. a small headlamp item would be cool, working like the mining helmet light.
---
I do know what an implication is, it is something that is in your head and that you hope others will pick up from what you wrote. 
---
I also know what literal means. You literally did not mention player traffic numbers or server costs. 
---
You then had the audacity (I know that word too) to tell someone that, you have just reiterated my point, on a conversational subreddit. When the point I made was different, a higher user count for lower server cost; not atoms, not FO1st &amp; by design, not through lack of planning.
---
I run both but I'm gonna get rid of being a Junkie. Way more damage with Bloodied. Sucks cause I have some good Junkies weapons too.
---
Wish they had a plan that would light up ore a different colour
---
I think they mean text chat
---
Yes. And I want food repair kits too
---
Junkies will become less relevant after Tuesday anyway..
---
I make playlists for when I solo, and I know it's technically a little late to fit lore-wise, but I headcanon that my character salvages albums of a bunch of early prog rock and some folk rock c. 1968-1976, while they were in the vault.  
---
But your station idea is -brilliant-. Appalachia has such a wonderful music history, esp during the decades that Beth tends to pull most of their music for FO from. I would absolutely play this station in my dance hall, the Gay BARn (PC).
---
The first time I saw the [Monongah Killbox](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ioi1cn/the_monongah_power_yard_killbox/) the guy who built it used those walls. They're really good, and I hate that I missed them.
---
I think that's by design, to make scary places more cinematic and spooky. But in my opinion they should just make darkness much darker and the flashlight into a directional one.
---
It's all basically the same business oriented idea, you just further expounded on the same idea. Which is literally what I've been saying. You didn't come up with a new idea. Your point isn't any different, you just added different bulletins to the same overarching idea. Business first. Beth did these things for these business reasons.
---
same for me. I switched to bloodied as soon I had decent weapons.
---
Also do you understand the paradox in using “exactly” and “implication”. It can’t be “exactly” what you wrote it it is covered by “implication”.
---
Edit changed to paradox, oxymoron not quite.
---
Server jump to a server where no one started the quest (&gt; lvl 20)
---
I wrote some of what you said that I didn't write, exactly as I rewrote it for you, and the rest was implication. You may think it's oxymoronic, but frankly not understanding it is outright moronic.
---
Bloody adds your percent health missing as damage.  At 20% health it's +80% damage.  Junkies does 10% per addiction up to 5 (max 50%).  I run both and have both available.  Certain fights I like to have more than 20% health, like Earl.  Capturing multiple pylons during Encrypted is another reason I carry it around.   Technically if I stayed below 1/2 health the bloody weapon will do more damage.  Really Junkies is best for doing the best damage when above 1/2 health(on current live servers).  You lose all your synergies when you're not low health(unyielding &amp; AR).  Most of the addictions are a minus to CHA and -10 DR is nothing in the grand scheme of things.  Even 1 or 2 agi or str makes almost no difference.  Yes you can do what your saying it won't be effective with only 2 addictions, AA would do more damage and you don't need the addictions.  
---
After the patch goes live Junkies will be not worth running as AA will do better damage with no down sides as does TS E also. (addition vs multiplication)
---
Backwards compatibility on both consoles, so no issue :-)
---
My 5.56 is 1c each. No more, and *definitely* not less. No thank you! I don’t want my prices forced down in an already turbulent market.
---
What's the point of using bloodied at full health? Get yourself some adrenal reaction, nerd rage, dodgy, blocker, and serensipity. Go stand in a river until your HP bar is 80% red. Then try again. You might notice a slight difference.
---
Correction, I'm level 130.  You think people care what you think.  So we are even.
---
YOU DON'T SAY?
---
So I supposed you prefer to call your friends, and never text them?
---
Rad rats seem the biggest issue for my turrets. They will usually attack most enemies, but ignore ghouls &amp; scorched half the time and never shoot at rad rats. Same happens in public workshops.
---
O lord. You are a genius. I am staying in this spot and build until One Wasteland so i can see what damage NPCs do in my spot and whether I have to move.
---
"One Wasteland" comes Tuesday
---
Season 2 starts on the 15th

Since you asked, it's called 'inventory management' as a game mechanism.  I'm not sure I buy it, but it certainly exists in other games, including board games.  Its a legitimate game mechanism in many worker placement games.  They use it to reduce load on the servers, of course, but it's also part of the design, like it or hate it.  If you don't like it, more power to you.  Just don't assume everyone thinks like you.  Or maybe you are one of those guys who thinks he's smarter than everyone else.
---
I totally use the settler gauntlet as my main weapon, I got a top tier roll for my build on my first try and I use the HELL out of that thing
---
Fortunately, if you have Pacifist turned on, the only way that griefer a-holes can get you is if you claim workshops. Like the guy yesterday who killed me right after I claimed Charleston Landfill, claimed it, and did nothing other than smash my turrets and generator (I'd just claimed it and didn't even have time to build extractors) and sit on it. Sorry your dad didn't hug you enough, dude, or sorry that your uncle hugged you too much, whatever. But I digress.
---
Most people are either neutral and just going about their business or generally nice. I've noticed an uptick in a-holes recently and I thought that it was related to the Legendary Run, but I dunno. But even with that uptick, most people are OK. 
---
Like, as I mentioned in another post, I moved my CAMP to the Mire, and there's a radtoad spawn there. Several people have taken out the radtoads for me while they were checking my CAMP out. I know they get meat and scrap out of it, but they could just ignore them and let them thwack my extractor and walls, you know?
---
If he blocked you he should've just moved on. I don't even like pvp but I'll admit it's a dick move to block you and then still come back to try and start shit.
---
Well they will at ten bucks a pallet difference
---
That was my assumption until Remedy announced you’d have to pay for the Control upgrade...😬 worried this might be a thing with other games too
---

https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Powered_gates
---
Its been awhile since I bought them, but I believe you get them from Grahm.
---
Great idea. Here's a gift (it's I'd like to thank)
---
Indeed, I always build a scrapbox when I claim a workshop so that I can dump it off pretty much as soon as I get it from an extractor. They may get their (sad) jollies killing me with their legacy exploding gatling plasma, but they aren't getting any of my scrap.
---
Bloodied is the best because it adds a challenge to the game dont die it feels like you're level 100 and level 10 at the same time its oy annoying when you do a SBQ battle and die from rads and loose your flux
---
And you're taking your anger out on us because...?
---
[First listing on google "powered door plans vendor"](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Powered_gates)

Last night me and one other person collected. We had like 85 ore with three minutes left. There were four other people there. It would literally have taken no time for two of them to go down one tunnel each and we'd have 100. It's so infuriating.
---
Would be good to have a use for the vocal sacks other than looking dodgy in a display case and cluttering up the stash .
---
Dunno saw a guy saying  he got in and said he got all the unique president items wanted to clear that up for people
---
Hahaha, I have one before getting ripped by a yao guay.
---
I'd be okay with it if it just had more headlamp options than star-in-a-tube. At times I get scared I'm going to give things skin cancer because it's so bright.
---
This event is the new OVN. Get used to not succeeding because people want their XP farm and since OVN was nerfed this is our replacement.
---
I have a two shot combat shotgun that one hit kills most things in vats but if I use it outside of vats it does the same. Health bar drops to almost zero then fills back up. I have to hit an enemy 4-5 times to kill. I was told this is a glitch with two shot weapons and the shotgun damage perks. 
---
Not sure about the other shotguns.
---
Nope, I would never effectively tell someone to shut up ( you’ve just repeated what I’ve said) on a social media site. I certainly wouldn’t do it when the point was quite different. I then wouldn’t exacerbate this by trying to patronise someone about vocabulary such as “implication”.  
---
Yes we are talking about the same “ends” because we are playing that “ends” in the game. The conversation was about motive, the motives we both suggested were both valid, but different.
---
I’ve never said my point was “new”, I’ve been saying it since the beginning of last year.
---
Hear you out? Hell no. Got my upvote before I even opened the thread!
---
I call them Nosferatus.

---
I never understand this about the trading market in this game. The difference between 35 and 45 will be negligible damage and a tiny bit of condition bar.
---
I've had this happen when building camps in areas that NPCs obviously wouldn't have pathing for, such as on a super high cliff ledge or over a river (covered bridge style camp).
---
It's kinda funny though, I feel like the AI in this game...learns. Like at first, none of my allies or collectrons would walk over my covered bridge camp despite building their objects on the bridge itself. But eventually, I'd see them start walking ever so slightly closer to the bridge before finally taking a step onto it. After a couple days they'd finally start wandering the entire camp which was pretty cool to see.
---
being able to only see whats in the cone of the flashlight during the night is pretty spooky aswell. i used a flashlight and darker nights mod in F4, shit was awesome.
---
Watoga
---
No, that's if you want the game made/enhanced for that new platform.
---
If you have the game for the OG box, it will still work
---
Oh, please!  Yes!
---
Would make the whole extra random legendary system 76 uses so much easier to swallow.
---
And extra plans could be worth so much more than caps.
---
This would be such a nice change.  😭
---
Love this idea, hopefully we’ll have it in 5-10 years.
---
I know that, but what about being stylish and having a red light to be even more badass.
---
I’ve never looked into day tripper, but mentats are fairly easy to craft once you get a rhythm to it.  On average I come out with 100 per run.
---
Only if you have completed Mayor For A Day.
---
Which side offers the best rewards in the last missions?
---
I've maxed raiders reputation and have friendly rep with settlers, but I think they have unique rewards in the last mission depending which side you picked.
---
PC already has that lmao
---
"mom said it's my turn to use the power armor station"
---
It's the best looking pistol I really wish they'd give it a buff :c
---
Yeah I’ve been loving playing as a bloodied and that’s gonna be my predominant build but I got a really good junkies weapon and wondered if it would be worth getting a couple addictions to add that extra bit of damage on top of my bloodied perks and mutation
---
This would be great. I was also thinking it would be nice if we had one scrapbox for the account, not one for each character.
---
My buddy does both on one character. When he need high health he just heals.  Doesn’t cure his addictions as the drawbacks are barely anything.
---
If it was an armor, so it did not count towards cosmetics, that would be fair. So you could wear that and whatever else you might want to wear.
---
No new content? Season 2, Covert Ops, Legendary Perks, and One Wasteland all come out next Tuesday.
---
Yeah, sometimes when someone tries to take my workshop and they fail they keep on pressing the revenge button. Once someone did it 20 times and still did not run. I won the fight as I said fair with no exploits. I even tried to give them a chance to run but people keep on insisting on their revenge. It's like they have to rebuild the pride and honor of their whole country. People are just either too much focused on their honor, and don't want to admit they lost, or just genuinely don't understand pvp.
---
I sure would count it XD. I sadly didn't get it or the raven/crow fasnacht mask
---
Wait, am I not the only one who bought all of my ss armor in mongrel meat.
---
I agree
---
Another perspective:  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/1wmrQRj](https://imgur.com/a/1wmrQRj)
---
I'd love to see these 2 plasma rifles, or these heavy weapons that aren't spool ups, some pistol variety that aren't pipe, actual snipers.
---
Explosives are pretty worthless and the MG42 which is arguably the most interesting Heavy in the game is hindered by the way 308 is made.
---
Even listing of every weapon and variation in this game doesn't compare to F:NVs unique weapons.
---
I’m not sure id say it’s a better RPG, but I prefer 76 to fo4. One thing that I honestly don’t even think is debatable is that the world design of 76 is far better than fo4.
---
It'd be nice if there was some sort of container at train stations that you could drop items in (securely) and have that container only be accessible by you and your other characters. So yeah, basically a stash box for your roster of characters.
---
I mean, having private server access helps big time. I literally just found out yesterday that I can drop items into a container, back out to the main menu, log in with a different character and the items are still there. This has made it so much easier to share items among my current 3 characters rather than trying to fumble around with someone else to move things along.
---
No it knocks your stats so I wouldn't just because I like high stats but you can go for it if you want
---
how is the Division 2 over all?  Destiny 2 also has some similar feature where you make a loot crate contain a certain type of item before you open it.  Does Division 2 hold your interest after you hit max level?  I'm struggling in fo76, all I do is log in and sell any more even Earl is boring now.
---
As a PC player, you have the ability!
---
Download Fallout 76 Quick Config, there is a Pip-Boy tab to change the light.
---
Did you know that there is something called an unarmed build
---
Have to agree with u/Choov323 . If your gonna go for full health you’d be better with junkies rather than bloodied.
---
Be nice if they just made it a new weapon rather than yet another skin.
---
That aint up to them, thats up to Bethesda corporate
---
Glitches like this I always hope don't get patched out. They're harmless(AFAIK they're visual only and only affect the person seeing them) and liven up things a little bit.
---
Makes me hope we somehow get the Living Mannequin thing from Skyrim. So delightfully creepy.
---
Oh, it's impossible to get glitches from one game into another you say? Pfffft. You've clearly forgotten what company we're talking about here.
---
PC players who are unaware, this is currently possible. https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/546
---
Pick the colour you want in the Pip-Boy tab.
---
All builds that use perks or foods, bobble heads, magazines etc for damage will be affected. The more a build relies on the multipliers the worse they will be post-nerf.
---
I'm thinking now is a good time for a break from this game personally.
---
Is that an eye roll?
---
If you are referring to me, I haven't downvoted anyone here even after being insulted. My whole point was that not everyone who drops things at peoples camps is a duper and with the type materials we are getting from BoS material turn ins, the person in OP's post could have just been offloading that. Maybe I will stop dropping things at camps from now on and just toss it when I get things I don't want. I thought I was being nice but I would hate to be accused of duping as it seems to be the ONLY reason someone would do such a thing anymore. Sure know how to ruin a game for people.
---
I had that happen once last night. Restarting solved it. 
---
But as far as ‘way more than ever’?  Hard to say since I think the last time that happened to me was about three months ago.
---
Then that’s the sort of details to include in your OP.
---
Just saying ‘There’s nothing in the Enclave secret room’ is extremely vague. 
---
Not everyone is aware of that room in the first place. It’s almost an ‘out-of-context’ post.
---
A mining helmet with the bright mod is really nice. I keep scrapping mine by accident.
---
Junkie weapons mean +50% on any health level) in case of need: adrenal reaction + nerd rage + magic junkie effect 
---
I moved from bloodied rifles to junkies combo: rifles + heavies &amp; don’t regret for it)
---
Maybe I didn't post that correctly. The build I currently run allow me to switch between full health melee to bloodied automatic without switching cards all the time.. Sorry for the confusion.
---
Yeah I have like 300 on my level 275. My level 125 is the one I am using these days, and she only has like 30 treasury notes. I just got the plan for the SS chest piece. Saving up for the jetpack mod and then I'm gonna complete the set. 
---
I'm waiting for meat week to start again so I can stock up on notes because I didn't do the vault raid with her until the last day of meat week.
---
I hate the pipboy light with such a passion. I forgoe all the cool and aesthetically pleasing hats and helmets so I can wear a mining helmet with a bright light attached to it.
---
Harpers ferry vendor sells them
---
I don't care about the travel cost. I just want fewer loading screens.
---
This has been requested for like a year and a half, it's not happening anytime soon man.
---
I did it before I had decent guns, hell I still don't. Using a non legendary Fixer till RNJesus drops me one.
---
Or dont download anything and just copy paste a easy to find command line to your ini.

---
Would like an complete HUD modifier, moving think around, displaying or not this information, have more information like current durability for armors or weapons, fade everything when you don't show up your weapon (more immersive imo), change colours for every components and much more, they can add this ability there is nothing hard about this, there is mods like that since fallout 3 and i'm pretty sure everyone can be happy with this, having your own HUD. Most MMO provide this !
---
No mods needed, extremely easy to manually modify the ini files and copy/paste a command line there.
---
I have pumpkin plans and pumpkin shelf plans, I don't think I have the other ones. I am interested in the tse handmade can sweeten the deal with a fixer plan or caps etc.
---
Dumb question. Can I get ban for installing mods?
---
How much less could you care?
---
In fo76 i don't see any difference between night and day sometimes it's really annoying
---
Would much rather they added new weapons to the game rather than skins for the current ones. Would add more variety especially if they balanced current pistols to make them competitive.
---
It will lose some of it's potency like any other damage increase effect. All of them are going to be weaker. I would not start removing them from our builds, as they all still increase your damage. Why remove them from the builds and nerf yourself further? If anything you should add more effects that increase your damage now, if you don't use all of them already.
---
LOL - the keyword here is definitely ‘WERE’ - much like drugdealers the first samples are free/reduced price...
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
If it’s just editing the ini file no. I fucked with mine a ton when I still played and was fine.
---
Junkies isn't really worth the debuffs with patch 22, better off AA or TSE. Bloodied still top, but not by much.
---
well yeah ik but they make it sound like there would be a text chat on console
---
I have a feeling this comment won't go down well, but I agree with you. Not 100% sure what people expect, given that New Vegas is on the other side of the country from DC, WV, and Boston, but hey.
---
Lol here’s one now
---
Workshops are the slowest, least efficient way to get resources. Look up farming guides on youtube.
---
Text chat is the most request feature and that's a low priority for Bethesda. I don't see this one going anywhere sadly.
---
Sure just add me and message me. I’ll be on in a few.
---
Oh god, they found me. Time to go!
---
I personally prefer it as underarmor, so I honestly disagree with this.
---
I've pretty much stopped playing already after finishing the legendary run, just pop in here to see what people are chatting about.
---
I’m running full unyielding so was thinking just one or two addictions that don’t take many points, I’ve just gotten alcohol addiction and my stats are still good so I’m gonna try mentats next
---
Some game have an text chat event on console, so why not ?
---
He ask for native, not a mod or .ini modification.
---
Love how the most requested feature is a low priority, soul crushing.
---
Does the helmet prove actual protection or is it just cosmetic like every other helmet in the game?
---
Ya, just the mention of pvp gets people mad. I think if Bethesda is smart about implementing features it could be really fun.
---
There is text chat on console.
---
And the HUD on PC supports it as well, just needs it enabled server-side.          
---
(interface/hudmenu.swf:Scripts/HUDChatWidget,HUDChatEntryWidget)
---
Personally, a C.A.M.P doesn't always need to be perfectly built or super esthetic if it has a very personal feeling to it, kind of like its own spirit.
---
Just read you update to above:
---
“no real end game and just hoping and praying” 
---
can you not see how this implies that Bethesda are apathetic to the game evolution? I agree it was unfinished. 
---
I don’t believe that the business plan of FO1st, heavy on the skins, light on the content was come about after launch. They’ve been applying aspects of this to ESO for years. 
---
As for Purveyor, I believed they existed at launch (at a different site) but Scrip currency was added later, I let this slide because I didn’t want to appear pedantic.
---
We have different points, yes they both involve Bethesda trying make money, but the methods &amp; motives (nowhere did you write or imply Bethesda saving money or Seasons) are different. Hence a different point. 
---
You’ve become quit agitated and so far tried to patronise &amp; insult (moronic etc.), I’ve done neither. I was agreeing with your initial point and adding a different motive (server usage and gamer traffic (explicitly)). 
---
FYI if someone doesn’t pick up on all the implications in what you write, sometimes it’s not that the person is stupid, but that when we read back what we wrote we can’t distance ourselves from our intended implications to see that maybe they were not that clear. 
---
My real issue is with you effectively telling me to shut up, because I may have written some of what you may have tried to imply. That’s not nice, productive or friendly. I’ve continued this conversation because I don’t like aggression for no reason. 
---
Let’s face it, if the game were better we’d both be playing that rather than having this conversation.
---
I thought tenderizer only boosted damage by about 5 pct?? Was it ever worth getting? I think I have a fully ranked card so I might try it.
---
I dunno about iOS, but it was removed from the Google play store awhile ago.
---
Yeah the negative effects I feel I’ll be able to handle, and I reckon I can run at 20% health most of the time so I think it’ll be worth it for the extra fire power
---
What's the point of these suggestions, we've seen this suggetion or similar the last 2 years, still nothing changed, so obviously it's not the direction they want to go.
---
it aint gonna happen.
---
This I could get down with
---
A stash that holds 50 pounds and transfers between all your characters would be enough for me.
---
But an Even 1000 sounds good.
---
Yes please
---
Boring, plus no xp, but Whitespring is excellent for this. The parking area by the laundry has two robot generators. These are good for about four robots per minute. If you want to go hardcore go inside the mall and get behind the baggage check desk and just kill hordes as they pour at you but you'll die with the assaultrons.
---
There's a malfunctioning Garden of Eden Creation Kit out there that's responsible for those.
---
Fucken eh!
---
I don't understand why we need a limit for daily turn in.  My favorite (and only) gameplay loop during content droughts is legendary farming, trading, and player vending. 
---
I would definitely play a lot more if I could keep working on upgrades to bullion items and finding those rare drops farming 3* enemies. 
---
Upvoted!
---
Dont you do that. The legendary perks are literally the only thing I've been excited for in this game
---
My thoughts exactly. I'm so sick of having to swap in and out of picklock and hacking perks and then back to my combat ones
---
You'll be fine*++
---
*except that the enemies in the new daily ops mission can always see your Bloodied Commando, so tank up a little
---
++And world bosses take a lot longer
---
Always equip and throw those grenade around randomly, to get rid of them. Never drop them.
---
There's a reason why the end of a public event is often punctuated by random floater explosion noises. This is why.
---
I mean, many of them are boring, yeah, but they are effective at making more competent builds. Staking some SPECIAL on your character for more perks sounds like a great way of rounding off any build.
---
Yeah, they may not be crazy and exciting, but they are a great way to improve your builds past level 50.
---
Yeah that could be it!
---
If you have one. Play the guitar on someone’s fallout first tent then get them to move it. You will be playing it without playing it. You can still move and fast travel, buy from venders. If you die you will have the sound of gutars with you.
---
Be aware that Ricochet can turn friendly npc into hostile if you stand between them and their target and the perk proc.
---
Somehow I'm not too concerned with this in nuke silos.
---
Keep a couple  radiation emmiters strategicly around your camp and no one will stay too long , but have your pacifist mode on or youll have ai and sour players coming after you .
---
&gt; How would you RP this??
---
You seriously want to "RP" an arsehole?
---
Except you cannot. You can only see them. These are unreleased the become president quest was struck from the game
---
Yep done the same and it's definitely the fastest way. Barehanded in the hotel sounds scary though hehe
---
&gt;SPECIAL on your character for more perks sounds like a great way of rounding off any build.
---
i mean if not for these perks legendary perks would be shit
---
I've been playing this game for over 400 hours and I never knew that building had a basement.
---
coming soon to atomic shop with an amazing deal of only 500 atom!  
---
A green color that DARKER!!!
---
People are dumb and simply cannot grasp the words on the screen to collect irradiated ore
---
always used ricochet on all my chars but I never tried it with a vampire weapon. Great info.
---
Day tripper (if it's the one I'm thinking of) I think there are two of them as guaranteed spawns in the Temple up north. Inside one of the side rooms on the top floor of the main building.
---
After like 350 Dr it really doesn't matter
---
Oh, Bathasda, for a minute I thought you were referring to that dirtbag company Bethesda.
---
No way to know how its done, nobody understands what makes this happen yet, random glitch atm
---
That statement was dropped like a week before launch when hype was still at an all time high, and no one knew the shit show that was about to happen. I'd bet those sentiments don't hold true anymore.
---
Oh yeah, I've only got two non special perks to be used, but to be honest, the special perks are the reason I got excited for them.
---
I am using a 2 star non bloody fixer but my main is a bloodied sniper which is great but has a slow reload speed. Though I make about 900 - 1800 dmg 😂

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a80jf8/tenderizer_is_better_than_you_think/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
There's some info on it
---
Ahh so it effects all classes equally? I.e we are all going to suffer the same and there's not going to be a new meta (would be a bit gutted to say the least after 2 years of grinding for my current gear)
---
However if the game becomes more challenging great! As much as I love it 1 tapping everything bar SB/Sheepsquatch/Earle looses its lustre after a while.
---
I call them slendermen
---
Always and forever. Often on the armor/apparel tab but it's not infrequent on the other tabs as well.
---
No, stealth is simply impossible in this Daily Op.  It doesn't matter how many points you have in stealth or how effective you otherwise are at it: Piercing Gaze means they always know exactly where you are, and it's a constant in this particular op, Uplink.  The other mutations, like Freezing or Volatile, exist on top of Piercing Gaze.
---
Outside of this Daily Op, stealth isn't changed that much.  However, as there is a greater incentive to team up with other players, you become subject to the game's awkward rules regarding teammates.  Simply put, their actions affect your personal stealthiness and redefine the meaning of \[Caution\].
---
I get around those damage numbers.
---
It's great for boss mobs. Correct me if I'm wrong, but even with the change in damage calculation this week, I think Tenderizer is calculated as a debuff? So it's still multiplicative? Then, if you factor in an 8-man team fighting Earle, everyone gets the bonus. So it's a 5-7% boost from all sources. That's a lot of damage. Unfortunately, I don't think it stacks, so only one person needs it equipped. 
---
If the bonus is, in fact, additive, like your weapon damage perks and Bloody Mess, then it's not really effective. Maybe worth one point, and only for boss fights.
---
Is it better than Serendipity? I'm new to a bloodied build and still die kind of often so Serendipity saving me pretty frequently is awesome.
---
If you consider just Primary legendary weapon effects, nothing changes. Relative rankings remain the same. However, there's something going on with explosive that, intended or a bug, makes some primary effects more OP than they usually are i.e. AA and TS.
---
Watch Angry Turtle's latest video on the topic.
---
If this is intended, looks like TSE might be back in the meta again.
---
Charleston Train Yard for liberators.
---
Why limit it at all - at the end of the day we still have to deal with the RNG aspect
---
I would love changeable pip-boy lights but you can instead use coloured power armour headlamps and you can use helmets like miner helmets to get different headlamps
---
we have to enjoy it, as long it lasts 🙈
---
If you're full health you're better off with solar, just keep SS torso with jetpack for flitting around, then swap to solar chest for combat.
---
It will be multiplicative, making it better than it was before.
---
Pacifist on? Also it could be a bunch of punji boards not a gauntlet.
---
You don’t tell us much really. 
---
What prefixes did your previous armour have and which ones did you roll on the SS armour?
---
And what sort of perk build are you running?
---
Yep lol well it’s good to know it’s not just me then. Thought I might have picked something up that was causing it.
---
I think we'll still be alright.
---
Lifehack: use the miners helmet that has a light, I put it on whenever it’s dark or I’m in the mire bc it makes it 100x easier to see. Plus you CAN customize that bad boy!
---
Good legendary perks &gt; better DR. I have a wood Vanguard leg piece that is weaker DR-wise than any of the Secret Service armor I have, but one of its perks is the one that makes weapons magic, and its other perk is ammo weight reduction. On paper, the Secret Service armor is better, but as a functional armor piece, the wooden armor is much better.
---
It's right at the bottom of the latest ItV article.
---
Yes but flamers don't work for that perk unless you gunbash! And gunbashing costs more ap than swinging the shishkebab!
---
I must be the only person who loves the combat rifle - I mean in automatic form and built out to same specs as the fixer. Which, actually my combat rifle does more damage than my fixer.
---
So you’re saying that you could actually care less-which means you do care. 
---
Saying I “couldn’t care less” about players hoarding vast amounts of ammo that they didn’t acquire through trading or crafting would be a more accurate response.
---
Yeah, emojis are weird. Like I can only blow so many kisses per day.
---
You have different legendary affects I'm guessing
---
Since we can change the pipboy skins on the armor workbench, they should do the same with the light colour!
---
Tuesday at reset I believe
---
the only one I focused to complete before one wasteland was “kill 1100 robots with no weapons equpped”. 
---
this one will be almost impossible.
---
You can do both pretty easily.
---
If you wanna change your light, just change the color value in the ini file 
---
There's a text chat mod that works plenty good and has a decent sized community
---
I thought it was a mutation or perk card name lol
---
It is in nuke silos, easily. Otherwise it's a sidegrade. Serendipity doesn't work in PA or at full health, Ricochet does but is less likely to proc. Having a Vampire's effect and just such a huge amount of rolls to proc push it over the edge in nuke silos to being a little bit overpowered.
---
Or put it on the arms, so there is finally a useful mod for those spots!
---
The option is there left over from Fallout 4, only reason i can think they don't let us have it is that it changes every pipboy light. (on your side)
---
I've done it before. It's fine if that's all you got but you ideally want something equivalent with bloodied instead.
---
Just remember, you don't need to ride the bloodied line so hard. 40% is still plenty for stats, extra buffer for health but about as effective as you'll be with junkies in terms of damage. All the below 30%/20% effects can kick in naturally when you're getting hammered by fire.
---
You could just run below 20% but I found that it wasn't worth the micromanaging because you don't squeeze out anywhere near as much damage as you do with bloodied for the same effort.
---
I always collect ore, always. If one of the scavengers dies though then I switch to just xp farming or just straight up leave. I'm in it for the rad barrel. I've only had ore collector help two or three times in past few months. Frustrating.
---
Pro tip. Rename your favorite weapons as ".(Space)______" that way they will always be at the top of your weapons list and there is no chance to accidentally drop or sell them.
---
With the XP meta (and it's only going to get worse come Tuesday), it's rare for events like Radiation Rumble to play out as intended anymore.  People are just there for the XP, nothing else.
---
It would be nice if they more closely tied the enemy spawning to depositing Ore.
---
Blasting those gouls as fast as I can is the most fun I have in the game besides earl, so I will stay up top thanks.
---
Plus, that design is a dick move for the ones who gather the Ore.  You'll be off in one of the four dead ends while everyone else kills the Legendary.  It's very similar to the Alpha creature in Project Paradise.  If you aren't in the right chamber when it appears, you're totally at the mercy of someone else not instakilling it.
---
Would be and could be, but is not.
---
The helmet has to be airtight for the airborne desease protection to make sense, but the rest of the moving parts create weakspots.
---
Idk about a 20 pound limit, some items r heavier
---
Radiation Rumble sometimes has this fascinating phenomenon.  I call it "How do six guys in Power Armor fail to protect the NPCs?"
---
Even though they are armed to the teeth and can take out Ghouls without a problem, it's like they collectively believe protecting the NPCs is "someone else's problem," so if one gets by and starts hacking all the NPCs to death, eh, whatever.  Someone else will deal with it.
---
Why would you run a build with polar opposite goals?
---
That's probably a good chunk of your problem right there. You need to commit to one or the other - go more tanky with full health or go all out DPS for bloodied.
---
Mr Miyagi put it best - Walk on road. Walk right side, safe. Walk left side, safe. Walk middle, sooner or later get squish just like grape.
---
I’m down, love going after wanted mf’ers
---
I removed my turrets because they'd ceaselessly attack traders and also take up way too much budget. I just have Gramps take care of enemies now.
---
Quick tip pistols aren’t viable in the end game just because they deal weak damage and they break really fast, maybe look into making a commando or other build. This is all from experience with a pistol bloodied build.
---
Yes! I've never nuked somebody's camp, but boy do those ones test me.
---
Dude it’s not like there is a finite amount of ammo in the game and someone having an ammo factory at their house is somehow taking ammo away from you. Also this is not a pvp heavy game at all so it’s not like some dude is rolling up to your house wrecking everything with endless .50 cal ammo. Stop being complainers and yea you’re cool just cause I typed something wrong doesn’t change the facts.
---
Also add the Blade Runner gun. Please, we need more pistols with interesting looks and not 3 reskins of the same one.
---
I know was trying to clear it up for people sorry I tried to do something nice :(
---
I'd be down for this. Also, team PvP would be easier had they not nerfed the core mechanics of it (everyone being tagged for it automatically.)
---
While at it, give the option to turn the light into a beam-like flashlight instead of the nonsenical AoE.
---
Yeah make sure you steal everything in their stash boxes, then use their junks as shield when you PVP others like a boss 💪
---
Whilst I would love for there to be no limits whatsoever, Bethesda ain't gonna be that nice - I mean if we are gonna take that line of thinking we might as well clamor for no limits to anything at all, and how many times has that been ignored? But it seems more reasonable that increasing the limit would be considered at least. At least this way we get far more tries per day than we did before. This way you help the average player, and avoid opening the floodgates for cheaters and dupers to take advantage if it was instead unlimited scrip limits.
---
In this scenario the public team could be transported to a world with only wanted people. So when you get wanted you transfer to this world and fight for survival.
---
It depends on your prefixes. 
---
My farming bloodied character runs with an uny AP refresh Secret Service set. You need to have a certain prefix depending on your build. (i.e, vanguard doesn't work for bloodied builds, etc)
---
It we had world populations in the hundreds, sure, this sounds like a neat idea. However we have what, 20ish as the upper limit? Most of the time you'd have a team with nothing to do.
---
Bows or Unarmed power armor(RIP). Bows are wholly inferior to guns, but I enjoy them more than any Fixer. Unarmed power armor is a meme build that is going to be even less effective Tuesday due to One Wasteland scaling up enemies, but damn is it fun to go full Saitama in lower level areas!
---
My favorite thing is when the caravan co guards tell me that I’m on chems, it’s really funny and I have no idea what triggers it.
---
Do you have vanilla SS armor, or have you added mods to the pieces?
---
MONDAY
---
Right now because of the Scrip sale, all I can do is log on, trade in like 3-4 weapons and log out because my weight and stash limits hit the max. 
---
Because of the oddly numbered and low Scrip limit, I'm stuck with a bunch of legendaries. Usually I make room, but I want to take advantage of the sale to get the things I want before new items come in or the update comes out, reducing OP weapon drop rates. Just got a quadruple double barrel that I wanna try out, but can't for example.
---
They should of raised the Legendary Scrip exchange limit for these 4 days.
---
Monday at 11 am Central
---
Turrets being blind is the most annoying shit in the game for me. When I see my 20 turrets just ignoring the stupid molerat that is literally destroying the entire workshop single-handedly is enough to burst a vein.
---
Second,  their range is absolutely pathetic. Yes, I'm talking about enemy NPCs taking shots at my camp while none of the turrets are capable of firing back.
---
Third, laser turrets need a buff. They cannot compete with the amount of dakka that missile turrets and machineguns provide.
---
Please. I love hunting wanted players.
---
Hi, the thing is that you've actually missed this season by a few days so the daily and weekly challenges have ended and picking up these items via the game board has been locked.
---
The next season is starting soon and you'll have the new challenges coming up every day that will earn you SCORE for that. On top of this, some of the rewards from the recently finished season are going to be added to end game vendor lists, so you haven't missed out entirely.
---
Sneak out, even just a little and then make a run for it when you don't have many in your way...? 
---
Got a stealth boy on you?
---
Fast travel as soon as you respawn?
---
Respawn elsewhere like Vault 76 or your camp. If they are spawning WITH you (and oh god, that's awful), relog!
---
maybe because we are secretly west coast BOS :)
---
Unless they change it to everyone in the event will b able to loot the legendaries n get XP for every death of mobs. Otherwise, no one will give up the chance of having legendaries and level up
---
I do think the bounties should be higher. The reward far outweighs the risk of such a low bounty.
---
Also, even if he doesn't show on the map, if you were somehow able to find him you'll still be able to attack him if he still has a bounty up.
---
Can you explain a little more about this? 
---
With perks and armor combine. Does it not work after each damaged resistance for each type is at 350?
---
Cause Beth gives a shit about qol tweaks.
---
Can't be that difficult implementing something minor like that
---
Energy explosives are legacy weapons. 
---
The only place to obtain them now is via trading.
---
Bethesda:   "...nO"
---
I dont think you understand what I said...the price is suppose to make people NOT want to get it.
---
This is really the only reason thatI bought the Secret Service Helmet was just for the light.
---
Haha!!
---
it's a dev room item I'm afraid. I'm sure lots of people have it but it's not something you can just trade for I suppose.
---
No it won't. It will still be one of the top few metas. Bloodied, Junkies and, now, AA will still be the strongest after the damage change. the research into this (onhere and YouTube) has been...exhaustive?
---
Adding to the previous comments. Try tackling ACP after 6 pm and equip mister sandman. If you select that perk card before covert operative you can get x3.75 damage in sneak mode. Can also use pyschotats and ballistic bock if you have them to ramp up damage further.
---
If you can spare the points use adrenaline and at least one point of tenderizer. I soloed Earle and SBQ using these techniques.
---
Forgot to mention, you may want to add asbestos mod to your armor to protect yourself against Earle's fire attack. That's if you don't have fireproof perk.
---
it is a dev room item, yes.
---
I've seen a LOT of vendors (including my own) selling decent weapons for 1/10th normal price. The heavier the weapon, the steeper the discount. Everything must go.
---
thanks!  i will
---
Actually the ammo machines don't bother me all that much.
---
I guess you could say...I couldn't care less
---
Ya, could be fun having a little chase!
---
You mind pointing me to a source on this limit? I'm currently on the pts and never heard of this. I currently have multiple special legendary perk card equipped with no indication of a limit.
---
An arsehole??
---
A basic function that was included in Fallout 4 and has been requested since release. Lol no chance.
---
If someone taps an unclaimed workshops while you're in the boundaries, they can hit you and make you go red.
---
Ah... you want to RP a burglar that breaks into other people's camps.
---
Maybe it's just me but it seems pretty self evident.
---
They changed that a couple of patches ago.
---
I think what he means is that even if the game *lets* you do something, it doesn’t mean it’s right to actually go do it.
---
Speaking of You Tube, watch this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EeNcV7OxZU&amp;t=3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EeNcV7OxZU&amp;t=3s) :-)
---
Question about the shish kebab, I have two stars into friendly fire and while it does heal it does it really slowly. Going to 3 would screw up my build and I would need to respec.
---
I just got a fss one and haven't had a chance to try it, I am assuming that I will be able to heal 40% quicker. Do you think the third star is worth the hassle?
---
At least you do not get challenged for owning your own ammo factory on the wasteland...
---
 Fallout 76 is an online action role-playing game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks.
---
Well generally people who run Bloodied are trying to push the game to it's limits on how much damage you can put out. 
---
So even if it's negligible it doesn't matter because it's still a difference in damage, therefore it's not valuable to them
---
&gt;the 'Save Everything' mod
---
Good to know that this option exists. Thanks for the tip.
---
As someone who played siege since the beginning til 2018, op health did nothing.
---
bruh you're making leaps chill. considering they have increased stash size multiple times, and have a inf scrapbox it's pretty obviously bad design especially when the vocal majority has it as one of their biggest complaints, no im not smarter than everyone else. Talk to people in game or most people i come across hate the limited storage.
---
Am on PC (sorry) and I sell them because I HOARDED them. I know I'm not selling them *YET* but I will be soon as we get closer to October. Perhaps I'm not the only one to think like that? lol
---
Had the same happen to me last night.  Had a few plans that i learned. Kept some of the aid stuff.  Split the remainder up @ Vault entrance, and the Sutton, Charleston, Whitesprings &amp; ?? (Pleasant Valley, i think) train stations. I think i was charleston that also had a stash of one star legendaries.  Hopefully made someones day.
---
Im running junkies/bloodied commando and it works fine. Its not as good as bloodied of course but its not far from it. You shouldnt worrie about the addiction drawbacks since almost all of them only effect specials and with unyielding gear you completely counter it. I would go for all 5 addictions
---
Yeah I just got it there, was so nice to Ra-Ra gave her good food chose all the best dialog she even called me her new friend while getting the power armor head, then said it was fun and I should stay at the crater and sleep in hers and Gales room but then when I asked her to help she said only if I have to you’ve not been nice to me butthead.. was quite taken aback
---
Yeah, 99% of the legendaries I actually wanted I got via trade, gifts, and lucky moments at a player vendor.
---
Wow, I am going to take a look at this then, thanks!!
---
I just assumed we could since fo3-4 can. Never tried it but I guess I'm going to install that mod if I ever want to change it now.
---
I got nothing worthy from grandma spending at least 2300 scrips... walked up to vendors n sold everything
---
Yep.....for **HEAVY GUNNERS**. I am waiting for him to continue with other ranged like rifles, pistols and shotguns as well as unarmed.
---
Honestly, for pure comedic reasons, i want to duel someone with commie wackers
---
It'd take longer than 6 months to fix the game, to be honest.
---
That being the case, it's far more profitable to push out content drops, where the dev time invested vs financial gain is infinitely less.
---
It's sad, but unfortunately it's the truth. Their model has worked out for them so far, and people keep paying for content, so it's extremely unlikely they'll ever change it. Especially as the game gets older, there's even less reason to change their model as less people are playing.
---
I also think trying to set aside any longer than a few months exclusively for bug fixes would be pretty harmful to the game, as the promise of upcoming new content is the only thing that keeps a lot of people playing (especially high levels). Without any new content, a lot of people would leave and never come back - probably more people leaving than bug fixes at this point would attract new people to the game.
---
I can't agree with this more! It's a shame that fixing bugs isn't a high priority for Bethesda. 
---
Fixing simple bugs or fixing bugs quickly without doing any testing, sure, Bethesda is all over that like white on rice.
---
Tackling the more serious, long standing issues in a manner that resolves the issue properly the first time around, hmm... not as much so. They can't even keep bugs that they've fixed to stay that way.
---
If you want some help to clear them out, I can join you for a few mins
---
Pony Express mail. You can place a mailbox in your camp that allows you to send items to anyone on your friends list who also has a mailbox in their camp.
---
Same, getting sick and tired of all their little game of constant nerfs. I’ll see how bad it is and if it’s as shitty as some have reported, I’ll just spend my time and money elsewhere.
---
I love my junkie's commando and my bloodied melee/heavy gunner/fuck around with fucked up weapons build. I'm trying to make a new bloodied heavy gunner build so I can fix my perks (plus I'm bored with getting close to level 200 on my original bloodied character. I want to go experiment with low level tings. I also want to play around with the chameleon mutation and berserker weapons.)
---
I was nice to her all the way through, gave her good food which she said was her favourite, she happily let me into get the power head, called me her friend, then said I could sleep in hers and gails room at the crater, but when I asked her to help she said that I wasn’t very nice to her and I was a butthead, I don’t get it
---
You are right, all the mods are in there for the helmet. However.. I built the HUD and it does nothing. WTH? I Think I will still have to buy it for gold..🙄
---
Basically it's not worth the debuffs/effort and is outclassed because of that.
---
Don't know why you were downvoted for a perfectly sensible take. Upvote to compensate 74.
---
Over here in the wild wasteland of PC, a lot of us do have excess Halloween plans saved up for trade tings. ;)
---
Thanks for the offer. What platform?
---
I’m afraid that I cannot give you exact details - I’ve haven’t been back into the PTS in just over a week (computer in pieces.....long story...), so my statement is based upon a couple of conversations I’ve had with somebody with reliable links into Bethesda and who has been on the PTS more recently....,so if it is not already the case it is actively being considered based on PTS feedback. I’ll see if I can confirm which....
---
I guess that we’ll just have to see in a couple of days!
---
Workshops are PvP zones. Always always ALWAYS stash your junk first.
---
m8, I run one star. 
---
I dont have detailed info, but It doesnt matter if 1, 2 or 3 stars. it heals tiny portions of npcs health. if you equip 3 stars, the amount healed is bigger but it’s never ‘chunks’ of health, it’s always tiny portions.
---
Outside of workshop zones and wanted status, yes, both parties have to consent to PvP.
---
All the time.  If they would fix the laggy inventory/stash UI it would probably improve my QoL on this game 10-fold.    
---
This is probably my Number One issue with this game right now that I would like to see fixed.
---
Not to mention trying to cook is what I imagine getting a tooth pulled feels like as I grit through the lag trying to craft my stack of glowing meat steaks.
---
400 each for uny sent armor? Omfg I'm quaking with jealousy. Nice find, my dude.
---
I took my mule through the wastelanders questline just out of boredom, overweight and full of weight reduction perks and didnt die. It honestly is not difficult at all lol.
---
While I don't know the answer to this specific question, I imagine that it'd be much the same as other stacked buffs, where no matter how much you have it caps out at a value below 100%. Like 90%, if weight reduction perks are anything to go by.
---
Vote this shit up!!!
---
Ghouls and cannons probably don't mix thanks to that zombie shuffle aka, the 100m sprint
---
Let's not forget Grahm.
---
Even if he just sang the Meat Week song over and over. That'd still be more enjoyable and more fitting to the game than the Ring of Fire cover
---
Thanks. Weird to get a downvote for translating something. Even though I agree it’s kind of an annoying idea, I didn’t say that in the post. Just explained what I thought you meant. 
---
If the OP wants to RP as a burglar, that’s ‘allowed’. But then so would RPing as a dimensionally traveling bounty hunter that follows his target through infinite dimensions, even taking vengeance against alternate timeline versions of the perpetrator, and even after the bounty has been collected and spent long ago. *For Vengeance never rests!!*
---
Using ‘RP’ to cloak bad behavior is simply an excuse. In D&amp;D, when someone says *‘But it’s what my* **character** *would do’* when they try to stab the king in the face at a royal dinner, or decide to butcher the shopkeeper for not giving them free stuff, etc, the correct response by the DM and other players should be *‘Then play a different character that’s* **not** *an asshole.’*
---
The helmet preventing airborne diseases and the suit preventing waterborne ones say that. Just because it separates and levitates my head off my body doesn't mean it's not sealed, obvs!
---
Canadian snipers?
---
It's not a weapon people would use so it's value won't be that high.
---
What do you want to do - maximise profit off it or just get some caps to get rid of it? 
---
If the former, maybe start at 500 (or pick your own number) and start bringing down the price until it sells. 
---
If it's the latter, just sell it for like 10-50 caps.
---
something that would make everyone happy
---
I just have no idea what that would be
---
Usually 200 to 350 is average I see
---
Fallout 76 has something called pacifist. Go to settings. Go to game. You turn that bad boy on, and you don’t have to worry about accidentally shooting another player (or on purpose) and have them turn around and fight. Most people have this turned on already. The ONLY exception  when pacifist does not work or protect you, is in workshops. If you claim one, or somebody else tries to claim the one you own, Pacifist won’t protect you. Workshops are meant to be player vs player. So if you aren’t a fan of that, avoid them. If you REALLY need the workshop. Just be careful and pay attention in case somebody just happens to walk by. 
---
The other exception is obviously when you have a bounty on you. This happens when you go picking locks to items in another player’s camp. If you try to steak from their locker water purifiers, their collectron, or try to pick the locker doors in their camp. Unless you’re doing that, you won’t really ever get a bounty on you. But if you do, any player can kill you. Once they do, things go back to normal. And pacifist takes over again. 
---
Your house doesn’t really get destroyed, there are only two exceptions that I am think of. The first one is, you start a fight with another player while at your camp, in which case THEN the other player can damage you and your camp. 
---
And the second exception being that somebody drops a nuke on your house. But even then, you have a two minute warning until the nuke drops. So that’s more than enough time for you to leave the current world you’re in, and join a new one. If you purposely stay in a world where the nuke is going to be dropped on your house, then you deserve it. 
---
Regular enemies will spawn near your camp, shoot at it or attack it. So it will get a bit damaged every now and then. But nothing crazy. 
---
Lastly, when you die, the only thing you’ll drop is your junk items. That’s it. No caps, no weapons, no aid items. Only whatever junk items/scrap you had on you. So unless you’re one of those people that walks around with 100+lbs of junk, and then complains about dying and another person stealing their stuff, then you have nothing to worry about.
---
For the recipe?
---
Your point?
---
no, but you can't play Nuclear Winter for obvious reasons
---
200-500. It’s rare to see lower than 200 and just don’t buy from anyone selling for more than 500.
---
mole miner could use some mods too
---
Damage reduction from different sources stack multiplicatively rather than additively, so it isn't possible to reach 100%. They each multiply the incoming damage before it gets fed into the DR/ER damage reduction equation. The only additive stacking is within a given set, so, for instance, a full set of sentinels gives you a 75% chance at 5x15%=75% damage reduction.
---
I've long since given up trying to understand why people would upvote/downvote something.
---
Also you're RP take is absolutely on the money. I say if you want to RP as an arsehole, raider etc. at least have the stones to own it and not be all "but come on guy, it's just roleplay".
---
Are you on about the serum or recipe?
---
damage reduction effects work multiplicatively and are applied one after the other. say an enemy attacks you for 100 damage, first that's reduced by 30%. then the remaining 70 damage is reduced by 20%, etc.
---
they all also work slightly different. suppressor is a debuff on the enemy and reduces its attack by 30%, while lone wanderer reduces the actual damage you're taking by 20%, etc.
---
bottom line is that you can't reduce it by 100% but with all the right perks and luck on your side (for rng effects like sentinel), you can mitigate it to a point where it's negligible.
---
Dont downvote me I'm kidding it was a joke

---
Recipes don't sell. Not if you're looking to make money.
---
Either you lose caps selling one you've purchased (even if you set it at the same price due to 10% tax) or you over price it and no one buys it.
---
Save the recipe for another character to learn.
---
The highlight of your day is correcting people’s grammar on Reddit. God I feel sorry for you 😂
---
Have you tried contacting Bethesda Support about this?
---
Good luck. We wall want a legacy but you gotta have one to trade for one.
---
Bethesda: Send more money.
---
I never saw anyone selling the recipe. The serum itself goes for 300-500 caps.
---
I've literally just purchased one for 1500 caps and was wondering whether I got robbed of caps or I got a good deal?
---
I use that perk at Project Paradise often, but I wasn't sure that it applied there at Rad Rumble, too. Good to know.
---
Could you please elaborate why the Solar is a better choice? I only have the chest piece so far and about to buy the regular SS arms and limbs and then the mods such as deep pocketed, asbestos ...etc.
---
Here’s a thought - they only have to die while you have nothing equipped, right?
---
You could throw grenades and unequip them before they detonate, or shoot mininukes/grenades into the air with heavy guns and II equip those as well.
---
Thank you. Was expecting to come back and see downvotes tbh. You never know with this sub
---
I have just purchased one for 1500 and the player had over 40 of em in the vendor?
---
Show me the part where I corrected you?
---
I do so love poking fun at idiots, and you're giving me a lot of joy in return for such little effort x
---
Recipes?  Sorry, my mistake I misread that.
---
Serum Recipes are **extremely rare** to see for sale since they stopped dropping from the SBQ. You can buy them from the Enclave for as little as 17,500 caps (with effective Charisma of 25+).
---
So if you happen to see anyone actually selling them for lower than that, and you or an alt or friend need/want the recipe, buy it.
---
Yep, no response so far. I'll update if I do get anything back
---
1500 caps is a fantastic deal since the one in the game is I think 17.5k from memory?
---
In that case, sell it for like around 12k. It'll be low enough that people would consider buying it vs getting it direct from the vendor and you make a sizeable profit regardless of what number you set.
---
That's if you're looking to resell. If you don't know it, just learn it.
---
I can't believe you bought a multiplayer game and then decided to bitch that...it's a multiplayer game. 😂
---
For the plan, that's a hell of a good deal
---
No worries just wondering considering I just purchased one for 1500 caps and the player who was selling them had over 50 of them
---
Bethesda: „For a lag free game you just simply have to go to the atomic shop and buy our expansion pack for only 5000 atoms.“
---
But I found those all by myself and never see other vendors selling them! It would be stupid for me to not sell above face value, because then I wouldn't make a profit!!! That's the entire reason you came to my camp, right? To give all your caps to me! You people come to my camp to give me your caps, but unlike the rest of you I'm smart and I only go to your camps for deals!
---
Are you selling any ammo, BTW? I'm selling .50 rounds for 7 caps each and Cryo Cells for 50 caps each. I'm going to be so rich when all you suckers buy all this ammo I paid 1 cap each for! Because that's how economics works!
---
Then it's Dovahkiin.
---
Like others have said, damage reduction works multiplicatively. You can never reach invincibility, no matter what effects you use.
---
Thank you very much
---
For 750 atoms
---
It’s a subtle difference. 
---
‘Guys, I’m RPing as a raider-murder-pervert so I *have* to be an asshole.’
---
‘Guys, I’m an asshole in *real life*, so I’m just going to go ahead and RP as a raider-murder-pervert, okay?’
---
***Clarifying note; this is not intended to imply OP is actually an asshole in real life. It’s simply for illustrative purposes.***
---
Lol.
---
I have the skull mask and civil war suit on and really low levels shoot at me. 
---
One I followed like Jason, never hitting them but being right behind or in front of them.
---
Then they went to talk to a random NPC and I killed them with my guitar sword...
---
I usually help lower levels but was so damn bored for a min ...usually in other Beth games that is I save then shoot/hit the guard/blacksmith/sheriff/farmer lol and watch the world go mad.
---
No killing here as I left them alone but same idea lol.
---
Exactly
---
They are about to be buffed, thanks to tank killer becoming usable with pistols. Also, with a crit build, pistols can performer rather well. Not stealth crit commando well, but still respectable in their own right.
---
Good luck with that dude.
---
&gt;They cannot compete with the amount of dakka that missile turrets and machineguns provide. 
---
Have you tried adding more 'spikey bits' or putting up a 'duruk'? You could even tame a 'squig' or two to defend your camp.
---
Will admit I'm fairly new and got caught out at a workshop I claimed(it was unclaimed when I started). I was defending it from supermutants and was then going to leave it (lvl 50ish at time) a lvl 300 turns up i stood up and waved hello , they shoot me dead with a tesla oneshot  so I respawed there again and did the loveheart thinking maybe it was a mistake and I could grab my junk ,nope killed again, clicked revenge thinking that was what did the  bounty,  popped back and this happened  3 times more time since I had no loot they eventually  moved on and I stood on my "defended" workshop with a much lighter backpack and damaged armor.   I will just say also I was only claiming the workshop as its was one of the daily/weekly  challenges we had to do and didn't really understand  that workshops are always PvP and that revenge does not make a bounty. So will say maybe they were still learning too
---
Ah. That’s most likely a duper, then.  The drop rate for them from the SBQ was exceptionally low (less than 1% IIRC) so legitimately having over 50 seems unlikely.
---
Monday at 12:00 PM EST.
---
I’m pretty sure the auto axe is in the game files, here’s a [video ](https://youtu.be/YDm8Rel27dQ)of it
---
My experience has been that people who are hell bent on initiating pvp are always very well set up for pvp, so it's pointless and not very fun to engage. I've had people attack my rifleman (pitiful dps especially when damage per shot is capped) and my shotgunner (no armor penetration) so it didn't go well when I tried to fight back, my weapons did next to nothing.
---
I prefer combat shotty over pump and double barrel. Combat gives the highest DPS simply due to reloads. My DB puts out 226 base damage and my combat puts put 206 base. There's not much of a difference so reload time is a huge factor.
---
That's terrible!  I've always wondered why anyone would send an email change notification to the new email address, esp with the line "if this wasn't you, change your password!"  Doesn't make sense. Good luck to you
---
What about a new event having us work with friendly mole-miners (who would be depicted as having newer miner uniforms and upgraded filters provided by friends of  Purveyor Murmrgh) against the robots or rival "mining crews" of mole miners. Actually it could start off against "rival crews" of mole miners, but then draw the attention of old mining site security robots and strike breakers, including a Sentry bot with a Mr. Gutsy Foreman inspired voice and a cigar shoved into the vent/grill on the front of its helmet.
---
Rewards could include some randomize ore, a legendary from the "Event Boss", some random mole miner scrap pieces, and perhaps add in a wearable copy of the Mole-Miner suit and hood/mask in the drops. Maybe even include a plan for the Rock-Breaker pick-saw from The Pitt DLC in Fallout 3. Would be a fun weapon to get, even funner if it got legendary treatment with its max level at 50.
---
I don’t always play radiation rumble, but when I do, I choose to get the ore...
---
PC?
---
Yeah I would love this! Currently I have zero plans to ever move my CAMP because I have it built against a cliff and I use it to get to either side of the cliff. I built it when two of my friends were at the top of the cliff. Now they have moved a fair ways away from my CAMP but since I put sooo much time into getting it just right... I don't want to ever move. This would give me freedom!
---
I've got about 500 hours logged and have only run into 2-3 people I'd rather not have the pleasure of meeting again.
---
Please add a skin to the powerfist that has the middle finger extended...
---
No, I have mostly seen them sell around 8-10k, but seldom see them in vendors
---
All seriousness aside, the favourite wheel has been bugged for ages and yes its super laggy when you load into a new area, yes, it's very annoying,  but no, Bethesda will not fix it in the near future because it's not high on their priorities.
---
I have 5 characters , 4/5 is at 1700lbs so no lmao 😁
---
I didn’t know there was an ss backpack.  Is it just a skin or is it an actual mod and have a function?
---
Yes pc! It seems that it's been happening a bit what I can gather from twitter. Going to wait for support and see what can be done
---
As they say, if I can build a nuclear generator, I can probably tinker with my pipboy at the... tinkerbench
---
Yes, kill them.
---
Damage resistance in this game is nothing like the threshold of new Vegas, in this game damage resistance is quite a complex calculation 
---
The amount of damage you resist thanks to your DR is based on the incoming damage and the amount of DR you have, the higher your DR is compared to the damage the more you resist 
---
However this change is only major when comparing defence values up to the amount of damage you take, going over the damage with your armour value has diminishing returns
---
I think it depends on how you want to define "role playing."
---
In the DnD "Let's roll dice and deal with statistics" sense, probably not.
---
In the "I *am* this character" sense?  Absolutely.
---
FED76 added a plan price tool.
---
Though the exact value in caps is subject to various conditions, it can at least give you a rough idea on rarity of the plan.
---

In your case of the assaultron head, it's available at NPC vendors.

---
RP'ing as a cat burglar that steals a minuscule amount of junk isn't being an asshole. With the repercussion of becoming wanted and losing caps.
---
Tbh you could do this from the beginning by equipping all the lockpick perks. I just thought it would be fun to play as a thief in the Wasteland.
---
Was this on console?
---
Personally, I got rid of any defense in my camp since a long time ago: it's worthless, and eats a lot of budget.
---
Yea over the internet anyone would do that. Real life would be a different story. You’re a keyboard troll nothing more.
---
Serums show as misc items; I find that at prices less than 400, folks will just buy my entire stock. Since I have limited flux, that doesn’t work out well.
---
I sell at 500, which gives me a slow steady  income.
---
Oh man, this gives me a C.A.M.P. build idea, too bad that cultist oitfit doesnt changw the dialogue of the camp allies
---
Solar heals you and nearby teammates even while in combat, with a full set..
---
I kill , and can usually hold down the entire area myself. If people want to get my scraps then they can tag things or get ore. Radiation rumble is also able to be done solo but I can only get around 50 ore. Haven’t been able to fully complete it .
---
Run away
---
Why are we given limits on scrip, caps, bullion, but no option to set a limit in our own vending machine?  I understand that I should be monitoring my 30k cap limit closely blah blah blah, but when you’re in events it sucks to have to worry about that and drop server.
---
For weapons, assuming you're stacking the same buffs, it hits all classes equally in terms of damage per second. Builds that rely on one-shotting get hit harder though because their one-shot damage takes a bigger hit, which might mean the difference being able to kill in one shot vs. two.
---
For builds, bloodied stacks the most buffs so it's seeing the biggest reduction. Anti-armor isn't taking much of a hit since it's effectively multiplicative, in fact with lower per-shot damage it becomes more important, so it is performing relatively well, only 5% or so behind junkies now.
---
Sorry to hear that. I'm sure beth has a record of your old account. Keep pressing. Also, setup as much security as possible...including txt verifications. Best of luck!!!
---
As much as the Pip-Boy is an iconic symbol for the franchise, I'd love to be able to hide it too. We don't really get anything out of having our inventory interface being part of the game world, it's silly.
---
Go check your C drive or somewhere your window locate at for any wdms or WLAN.exe, some applications like that they used most as back door app for hacking, btw kaspersky also is a back door application.
---
I actually took a closer look and it does kinda float. Didnt catch my eye before but now it bothers me 😆
---
This is the big one
---
MONDAY 12pm EST!!
---
That’s actually incorrect-ammo used to be used as a part of trades. Now the in-game economy is mostly trade-only for most non-scrip weapons/armor. It quite literally has nothing to do with PvP and more to do with making it so lower level players can only obtain high end items by trading in other high end items. If someone tanks the value of a certain item/resource in any online game it will certainly affect other players.
---
And not much of an argument-you basically said people were going to “complain” because they care about getting exploits out of this game-and painted that in a negative light... Maybe you haven’t been around long enough to see Caps, ammo, and flux be made next to worthless by those wanting to bypass the grind and get everything handed to them. Mass producing cheap copies of items in massive amounts absolutely DOES affect other players-especially players who don’t wish to bypass the grind by utilizing short cuts.
---
Blacklisted items are still blacklisted-tired of rude people on here calling out legitimate players-for disliking players who utilize illegitimate means as a way to elevate themselves in game. It’s an online game-our decisions affect each other-so yeah people will “complain” and care about them.
---
So you could say I could care less about this. Which is to say-I do care.
---
Damn, that looks clean. Any list of guns in game files that aren't usable?
---
I sell most of the useless but uncommon weapon plans for 200 caps and most of them always get bought. That one's definitely in the useless category, but people will buy it just for completion sake.
---
Hi and thank you for the encouragement!
---
I live for drugs.
---
Here's the wiki entry for [day tripper](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Day_Tripper_(Fallout_76)), though I personally have never been able to buy it from Doc Stanley. Now that I've got my addiction I stock any I find in my vendor, it is really a hassle to get.
---
You can get a bloody Ripper from turning in Halloween candy at the Monster Mash event. The chances of getting one are astronomically low, though...
---
They shouldn’t be a cap on gold bullion or legendary script  but the cap limit of 30k is good for a game like fo76 and should stay in place. People should trade items not buy/sell
---
And yet you talk about taking ammo as well. Let’s not split hairs, man. You’re taking stuff from other player’s collectors. If all you cared about was the ‘RP’ part, you’d just pick locks to doors and snoop around and then leave. Actually taking their items (while allowed in game) is still a jerk move. 
---
As I said before, just because you can do a thing doesn’t make it right to do that thing. 
---
If you want to steal people’s stuff, just do it. Don’t try to fancy it up or justify it.
---
This is an awesome idea!  I love hunting wanted players!  Def try to be as quick and invisible as possible.  If you can jet pack to high places even better.
---
I’ll take the furious combat shotgun if still available?
---
Thanks for sharing such great info!
---
This game will never go offline.. they ain’t give up on it when it first bomb so they ain’t giving up now that it decent lmao
---
That’s both funny and sad at the same time!
---
I have seen as low as 250 and high 1000 &lt;------ thats crazy  just keep looking
---
Should have enabled 2fa cause FO76 allows Auth 2fa, always remember to add extra security better safe than sorry

It’s an RPG.

Thanks to everyone who readily responded! I’m keeping my character since it’s easier to work with what I already have.

Demolition expert for damage, bear arms for the weapon to weigh less and ordnance express for the ammo.

I have a level 350 toon. I don't need to steal ammo or anything else.

I just thought it might be fun creeping around and snatching up loot on a low level character creating a wanted status for other players to hunt.
---
Thanks for helping me!
---
Interesting, 3/5 and a long of 3.5km - that's insane. TIL!
---
Thanks for a new perspective and helping me!

I personally like Charleston capitol DMV. Run through, kill 30+ ghouls in 5 minutes, server hop, do it again.

Thanks! It’s nice to know that’s available.

Go to a high level area and follow a high level around while taking pot shots at everything

No offense, but the text chat is hot garbage. I've tried to use it about 3 different times. Once you bother to configure it, you find out the options are basically *Global* (aka everyone using the mod) and *Local* (aka players with the mod, within 30m of you). There needs to be a server mode implemented somehow. Global is too busy, meanwhile local is a barren landscape.
---
I have this bug on my character, i get the PA screen for my pip boy even though im not in a PA
---
Unless the event gets changed to somehow reward the people gathering ore this isn't going to change.  I can get a large amount of XP as well as several legendaries just by parking my butt at the end of one of the hallways.  To gather ore I have to change into different armor and I end up missing out on the XP and the legendaries.  Like several events Bethesda needs to make all roles at the event receive the same reward or at least equivalent rewards.
---
Yep pure white is brighter
---
They would be my new neighbors. I'd be cool with this.
---
ah cool thanks for letting me know
---
Not sure why you got downvoted for that, it's true.
---
Easy to make a backup of your .ini files prior to modding, then switch between them for Adventure or NW
---
Well it’s crazy but usually when I see someone with an ammunition machine or one that digs up materials etc any of the glitched ones it’s always high level players that have them in their camps. Never low levels. So those that have been around for a long time should be setting the example of how to play instead of having them themselves. And other than people on here most players I’ve came across in game don’t care about people having them. But you’re right I’m not even level 60 so I haven’t been around long enough.
---
We will not see them in the game, there will be a long time before they found that faction in Megaton
---
The irony is delicious. You're the one inviting conflict in the first place (and in all your posts after). Thanks for the laughs, and feel free to keep making yourself look like a moron :)
---
Yea this could be the case. I have to do some tests the next days.

---
I would much rather have a bunch of new content and fixes of only major bugs then they fix the tiny bugs that are just annoying or visual for an entire year. That would honestly kill the game because nobody would be playing it, we can already see that when there’s a few week periods of little to no new cotnent
---
Run away Simba and never return!
---
Never had a problem using Kaspersky ever since I first used it like 10 years ago, i think its been nothing but good to me tbh blocking all the malicious stuff that tries to get into my computer and such
---
Don't they need verification from the old address if a new one being entered?
---
If so, your mail account is also insecure.
---
So do that by picking the lock to a door but don’t steal player’s loot. Problem solved.  You don’t have to take loot to get Wanted.
---
Quad is the best for long fights where repeated reloads hurt DPS. So yes, its a god gun for queen and earl. However, in normal everyday grinding where you have plenty of non combat opportunities to reload, it lags behind in actual damage.
---
we already have a crazy cult in the game tho?
---
I always slap on my stealth suit and hit all 4 rooms, but yeah it's very discouraging when no one else does. Guess we're just getting the first tier reward then cuz I can't do it all myself.
---
And, after that first run-through the ores barely respawn for me tho, so not sure how that works.
---
Also: I really wish turning in ores gave EXP, or you got bonus EXP at the end for how many you turned in. Just kinda sucks when I'm missing out on kills to play the objective.
---
He's making a pun.   You said you COULD care less when the phrase is really COULDN'T care less.  So when you say it wrong people ask how much less you could care as a dad joke  because you indicated that there is a lesser amount you could care.
---
Yeah so true😞 but they can put another faction in there too, i'm cool with that but i thought CoA fit perfect there with the radiation. My point is that the location isn't get used much so why not do something with it so players use it more often.
---
Cranberry Glade is my go to location for pets. A random encounter happens in the parking lot where you spawn in and a second one happens just NE of there inside the bog/woods a little ways. Deathclaws are cool but my yao guai has been the hardiest pet yet by far. He just never dies. Make sure to heal your pet with with friendly fire and a shishkebab if you ever see them with missing HP.
---
I hadn't played this toon since Christmas and its only level 15. Lol!!
---
Definitely not powerful!! Haha!!
---
I probably will just carry the junk around and if I get killed they get it all back. I just thought it might be fun to try out. Lots of negative feedback though. Lol
---
It is less powerful then my armor and backpack though. My backpack makes chems weigh 90% less which gives me 100+ carry weight and the 60 from the backpack
---
I just got this too. It's tied to a Note (literally just 'Note') that starts with "Petey,"  -- You probably got the Note out of a suitcase random encounter in the world. The dumb thing is that the Miscellaneous quest associated with this just disappears when you pickup the pipe revolver (or whatever weapon - location and weapon/armor type are random) but the quest tag on the item does not. 
---
Very odd.
---
They got rid of the atoms for dailys? 🤧 that was the only way I got my atoms. Before, the daily challenges were still quite a grind and I couldn't even get myself to hop on every day to do them. I do love this game, but it has it's moments that make me leave it for a few months. I think one of the best times I've had playing 76 is when they did the huge Halloween event. I hope they do something along those lines again this year.
---
Did you freind this guy because I would never loan my legacy. On another subject if you can get a good roll fixer or handmade or hell even some rare outfits some one would possibly trade a legacy.just need to find the right person
---
😂
---
You can't tame that one, it has to be a lone spawn at a random encounter. As for getting them home, I always just log out and play a few NW rounds, then do something else far away from my camp for a while and tamed pets get to my camp just fine nearly every time. RIP to that level 1 guard dog, though...
---
Thats really cheap. Bunker 20ish k, off players 6-10k normally. So i would get his name and buy afew to sell and make more caps
---
Dont trust the open world.lol put away your punch bowl or any dispenser you have.maybe put vending away there has been bugs tied to camp budget etc that could in rare instances to show your stored items but its rare.you should be ok

So what you get from bethesda is a email saying email address : (your old email goes here) has been removed. Verify your new email address via the email we sent to (new address). If you think this is wrong. Please reset your password. However resetting the password sends it to the new email.

I've always wondered why I couldn't eat wendigos lol. I figure they're not that different than feral ghouls basically, and I can eat those.
---
I just pop out Cannibal and Lead Belly to fit Ironclad for that fight, helps a little bit. Probably wouldn't have time to snack during the fight anyways, though some of that free HP sounds nice - Earle kicks hard in melee.
---
In an unrelated note: holy god the constant staggering, from him and his buddies. Wish there was an endurance perk to counter it better than the pneumatic chest mod. Or make Adamantium Skeleton also lessen stagger.
---
Well, if you're tired of one-shotting things then...GOOD NEWS EVERYONE! 
---
But seriously, like Imp diplomatically implied &gt;!*slow weapon damage is wrecked on the PTS.* But commandos and heavies just hold the trigger slightly longer!&lt;
---
ATTENTION  I have seen in more than 1 place that on the PTS if you have the ammo factory glitch you cannot place your base when you load on any server.  You will have to rebuild it from scratch and will have a very small budget loss glitch still.
---
They just need to be scripted to land every x amount of minutes. The fact they fly around forever sometimes is mind boggling.
---
I think music wise, getting instrumental covers of songs would be the best route to take for the mole miner musicians if they were a thing. 
---
Maybe get something inspired by some mix of Jandeks somber self taught guitar work (https://youtu.be/ua7TfcxJqRU ) or the incomprehensible time signatures like in "My Pal Foot Foot" by The Shaggs (https://youtu.be/XR9d4ESlpHY ). Maybe throw some Hasil Adkins (https://youtu.be/N6yaTqR4ZLc ) in the mix to up the tempo and throw some aggression behind it and do all the vocals in Mole Miner noises and I'm down.

Lol.i have a really odd pic of some guy that has at least a 1inch 8ft arm with a gatling plasma for a head and on the side of the plasma a wolf fedora with glasses kinda nightmare fuel the legs are just strange.not the wendigo look it's odd as hell
---
basic crit just adds 100% of weapons base dmg on top of you already boosted dmg, so its basically useless and only used for 100% guaranteed hit now, with the new patch, every modifier is applied to the weapon base dmg so crits can become more useful, but nothing about their calculation is being changed. Better criticals rank one make crit add 120% base weapon dmg to rank 3 adding 140%, but if you have handmade that has base like 50 dmg, 120% or 140% doesnt make that much of a difference so I would advise to use only rank one of better criticals maximum
---
cranberry glade, beside the spawn point, was where I got mine... he died due to a camp spawn in glitch though. 
---
RIP little lizard
---
There's also clans, trade, and ptp whisper. Most of what you're wanting isn't going to help, not everyone is using the mod on the server you're on
---
It’s happened 4 times in the last week and never happened before. I’m just glad restarting is resolving it but confused why it keeps happening
---
Depends on you level.  
---
  If you can survive at WS, killing all the ghouls outside will net you nearly 10k, running solo, and significantly if you are on a 4x bond build team.
---
Radiaion rumble is another.
---
In the case of an automatic tesla rifle, I'm not even sure if it's possible to tell if it's truly "one shot" but in my mind, any gun that kills you in less than 1/4 of a second, without hearing multiple gunshots, is a one shot.
---
Maybe. I looked into all of the types of cryptid out in west VA when the game came out. This dude is suppose to be friendly... mark him down as the mysterious stranger lol
---
I have to try this, though I think I'll need legendary agility to fit it in my build. 
---
The wiki said something about explosive bait always making them land but I couldn't get it to work. A syringer upgrade that does it would still be nice for non-shotgunners.

So cute when you try to troll me, but this isn't me stating an opinion.  Google  "psychology of online trolling".  I didn't feel the need to cite specific studies because I thought everybody was aware of this.

Thankyou!
---
Poor guy :(
---
Ty that’s helpful
---
What system? On Xbox you can change back and forth between the two by pressing the (used to be) back button. Not a big but it happened to me and I didn’t know what the hell was going on for a couple minutes.
---
Herd Mentality is fantastic, I agree. It has essentially zero downsides. But yeah, it is sorta weird that Empath's reduction applies to you. I always thought it to be a more selfless perk - kinda like how I didn't expect Taking One for the Team's damage bonus to apply to you as well.
---
But the reduction from Empath doesn't make you immortal or anything. Bosses, like Earle, still do noticeable damage, even with high DR and perks like Dodgy.
---
That's why I use a helmet with built-in light.
---
I just wish I could have the mining helmet light without wearing a helmet, I hate the pipboy light
---
And a set of workbenches!
---
That's why I don't buy/use those skins. My boyfriend lost an incredible good gun and I got terrified to do the same, since the lag of pip boy ALWAYS make me drop something I don't really wanted to drop. Feel for your lost.
---
It's certainly annoying when they just flit back n forth crop dusting ya and refusing to land
---
I would like a "You're a dickhead" emote for people who throw plasma grenades at the queen.
---
Wait.. PERK MANAGER??
---
Solidarity, brother! Single father here too. Rock on!
---
It's the same for everyone. They used to be able to allow us to see the items in players vendors but took it away awhile back. I could be wrong on why. But I believe it was purposes of making the servers more stable and less laggy.
---
Bait is an old wives tale on the Queen at least.
---
Above 350-400 does help reduce incoming damage, it's just that 300 is generally *good enough* for most PvE situations, and the effort to go beyond that number is quite likely better spent on percentage based damage reduction perks and legendary effects
---
Noon Eastern.
---
Wow, really? I'm on ps4. I didn't know that and tbh i didn't mind the PA PB screen. My frames are better with it
---
This will give long term players an advantage for a while given the cost to rank up.  They may eventually increase total legendary perk points to over 6. I could use about 10 for what I want.
---
I spent so much time trying figure out how to change it in 76 after doing it in fo4. I don’t know why they would take it out.
---
I’m just picturing seasonal bases with no rebuilding after the first build. What a life that would be
---
End game of fallout 76 , exploring , grinding lvls and loot, camp building , market trading. You do the seasonal events anecdotes now legendary runs  to kill time . There isn’t really an “end game” dungeons , you play fallout 76 for the fact you enjoy being in the world and the community .
---
Oooh a facepalm emote would be clutch
---
That is, if a middle finger is too much to ask 😂
---
I want to say thanks to the players who have tirelessly put up with random bugs, CTD'S, crashes and other weirdness,all in the pursuit of making our nuke launching easier. KUDOS, my good men!
---
Got fallout first so I could play with my friends on a private world lol 😂 jokes . He’s not able to join me lol
---
u/ladydevann this is a grave security faux pas on Beth' side.
---
  I think you’ll find it allows you to take a few more hits than you could before, but is not going to make you unkillable, especially against a mob.
---
 Those high level enemies still hit hard, and even low level enemies with high power weapons (scorched with 308s, for example), do a surprisingly high amount of damage.
---
My alloyed/polished heavy metal set was 330, my butressed SS set + Barbarian gives me 400 + 50PR, 250 ER, and 250 RR.
---
Even so, I still need PA when I goto WS golf club.
---
OTOH, the cottages that contain 1-4, I can do without PA (which I could not do in the metal set.)
---
  I can also now take on L91 deathclaws w/o PA, again something I could not do before.
---
So I guess you also won't be keen on the idea they are adding yet another new currency to handle Perk card trade ins, or so I have been told.
---
Maybe, I’m not sure. I’ve only seen the Auto-axe
---
Interesting. I had a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f4dDlj-2q24GIUeAeQKp2lNhvjy-T4vlEcHux3Y6YEk/edit?usp=sharing) going from someone asking about sustained dps on an assault rifle so I crunched the numbers. Against Earl it looks like quad is out ahead of even   
---
bloodied by 8.6%, and way ahead of anti-armor (37%).
---
Vote this shit up!!
---
Oh sorry. No I usually see recipes for 8-10k
---
me here with a gun that MAYBE does 3 damage if I hit her head. Gonna be a while before I can oneshot it like the rest of you..I have bad luck with legendary drops.
---
Hmm too soon to tell. Nerfs with buffed enemies. If it feels the same to fight enemies at level 5 as it does level 500, that’s a hamster wheel. We’ll see if we are still strong wastelanders or high level hamsters
---
They should just bring back the old system where it’s 1 cap per level, but it should max out at level 100. After that, every action that would cause a bounty should multiply it by 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.
---
Mine are all lvl 45.  Maybe because she was in the nuke zone it didn’t really work all that well?
---
you just need to be able to equipt animal friend 3 thats all
---
Yes, i excluded those in my example, but still not what i wanted.
---
to save it, you save the link. every detail you picked is attached to the URL
---
Whats your build, just asking out of genuine curiosity. Thanks for the downvote smh?
---
I’d like a pip pad, yeah.
---
Thanks for the info. I usually have one gun army swapped in for SQB fights. I’ll try doing the event with out it.
---
It would be nice if they would also address the problem with the spotlights only working when you first power them up. To get them to work subsequently you have to delete the wire and replace it.
---
I stand corrected. Got my days muddled lol
---
100% this. There's a lot of old, out dated info about taming pets online but charisma is completely unimportant as long as you have enough for animal friend 3. Also wasteland whisperer is not required to tame anything to send it to your camp, even a mirelurk (which should technically need it).
---
With 5 pieces of sentinel you are absolutely more tanky than a PA setup. Add more defenses to your armor in addition to that and the gap becomes even further.
---
I sort of hoped that the amount of gold spent on the helmet, at least give us some added defense..
---
Depends on your build/perks.  What type of weapon is working the best for you now?
---
Im 15 STR, 13 PER, and have equipped the appropriate perks to switch between melee and rilfes.
---
I like fast 1H melees (switchblades), (explosive) lever action rifles, and a vampire gatling plasma.
---
But as other posters indicate, that all may change Tuesday’s update.
---
I’ve seen some people have this problem to I think you might have to delete the game and download it again
---
Exactly why I support this idea. Blueprinting is useless unless you build on level terrain and move to level terrain.
---
Its perfect lol, looks like he got up knocked the chair over then passed out on the bar.
---
It's a non-stacking mob debuff. The greatest of the tenderizer percentages is what the mob has. However, in a world of additive bonuses, tenderizer is multiplicative so it is much better than it seems.
---
[I run a Non-Addicted Full Health Sneaky Vats-Crit Commando kinda like this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6b455be&amp;d=sa0sg2p00pg2ph2pi2e82e00c72cu0i11ic2a72ar0an0a02a31ao0lb0lv1lt2lr2l71sb0s00lk2po0&amp;w=c52i30ii0ij2ia0if2ik0i50iq2at1lm2pa0p10p70p30p90p80&amp;m=5c8&amp;am=13-16-1h-10-1d&amp;wp=w6w6w6&amp;wm=17-17-1j)
---
YMMV...
---
Yes! Smoke machine is in it, instant buy.
---
It is a good atom price for the stuff you get.
---
I had class for the week that the steel dawn army fatigues were on the shop, now i cant get them and i'm beyond pissed off.
---
Just do it.
---
  Typically, the only time you might have to worry about high levels owning you is if you take a workshop, then stay inside the zone.
---
Turn on pacifist and go exploring.  
---
  Joining a build team will help you gain XP faster.  Will also help complete challenges on the legendary run when it starts.
---
Thanks :)
---
Thank you for this! Totally fixed the problem for me. Wasn't working on a new laptop. Figured all of the direct X stuff would have come with windows or been installed by steam when the game was installed. Guess not.
---
Here is the English URL for those that need

---
You are probably going to lean on sneak attacks to get some real damage going (doesn’t seem like you are trying Bloodied). Instead of Charisma points, put most of that in Agility, get Sneak, Covert Operative, and Escape Artist. VATS should be ideal so Agility is necessary for the AP. Charisma really has no great benefits, besides a couple cards like Stranger In Numbers or Lone Wanderer.
---
A buddy has taken a break to, he's coming back for the same reason. I can't wait for the perks, daily ops to. I want that SpecOps BOS outfit to, and the icing on the cake for me, is One Wasteland.
---
This is my 2nd char and have learned a lot. It is very different from my Stealth Sniper. With regards to the damage on the small stat page, is that the effect of the 'magic' or simply your perks and stuff?
---
If this is the Angry Turtle vid, he says that Junkies will be better than AA at full health if full health build is considered.  Which confused me because who uses AA while being a low health build?
---
Vote this shit up!
---
Like, green, Beth? Really? So fucking stupid.
---
Lol the meds the quack prescribed him must of sent his head west lmao
---
You should see the forums were food builds spam demanding hunger/thirst being removed. Ironic.
---
Like, they want this game to ditch all progress and go back to being Fallout 3.
---
The clap is also a common term in the states 😀
---
personally speaking, Tenderizer past rank 1 is a waste of perk slots. +7% more damage isnt worth 3 perk points
---
I see them sometimes. I'll check again today and see if anything has changed.
---
XP/loot doesn’t matter anyhere near as much (to me) as the T-notes do.
---
My char is melee and carries a SS ghoul slayers switchblade.   Better used/suited to hover over one of the workers and keep that worker alive.
---
I know I think he was trying to scam people what a ass close
---
Be careful transferring over private servers, I done it loads of times but it's caught me out a few. Earlier today I lost a Van/AP/Sent marine chest, a JE pump shotgun, a troubleshooter sentinel set and about 30 other legendaries. No disconnected message, internet drop, nothing. Really weird, but it's still the safest method unless u got a friend who's willing to regularly help u transfer stuff.
---
You never see a well-made workshop because it gets 'deleted' when you log off. How many people do you seriously think are going to decorate Tyler County for 5 hours everyday from scratch?
---
Really! I had no idea the more you know
---
You should max out perception and add concentrated fire. Headshots are where the damage is. Drop charisma down to 4 points, run 3 ranks of tenderizer and strange in numbers. Drop intelligence down a few points (and this is mostly opinion bias - you don’t really need to run around with gunsmith active if you fight the queen often enough you’ll get improved repair kits which will save you on materials when you need to repair your gun, also use precise or forceful stocks as they increase the durability of the rifles without sacrificing accuracy). After dropping points from intelligence and charisma move those over to agility and pick up sneak, and covert operative. 
---
Other good perks to have, but 100% necessary:
---
Tormentor, better crits, Crit savvy, psychopath
---
Edit: also max out perception for overall rifle damage boost.
---
This bothers me because there is also no other way to see what something is called. If the item’s name is too long you can’t see the whole name and I feel like I miss out on some good armor scores because I don’t know what piece I’m buying.
---
76 has made me a shit Overwatch player. I dropped from Masters to fucking Gold after a year binging 76.
---
This is what I've basically been doing. Are you certain this guarantees the details are saved? I'm almost sure I've visited the same link and found some changes missing.
---
I was using my just turned level 50 Shotgun char and Santpowner dropped FOUR serums for me. For nothing. I don't have Class Freak yet but those are in my Stash until I get it.
---
Here is my old Stealth/Rifleman build.  You just swap out Rifleman for Commando and viola.
---
The more QoL (Quality of Life)  perks you take the less damage you are able to pump out.  So that makes stronger monsters take longer.  Now if you don't care then rock out them QoL perks and have a great time.  
---
I just believe its easier to adjust your inventory vs. waste spots on perks.  I used to carry 50 stim packs. but only ever used 4 or 5 in any one situation.  So why was I carrying so many?
---

---
people suggested NPCs, a radio host, ammo converters, clean sinks, free fast travel to crater/foundation, etc. Look where we are now mate eh?
---
I want this so badly to happen. The only advise I can give to anyone feeling the stress from having too much to enjoy new things all i can say is you have to just drop what you don't need. I know its easier said than done, but once you start being able to let some stuff go it makes the game worth it again.
---
 This won't be a rant about materialism or a take on minimalism but the key is to know when you've let a ridiculous game mechanic ruin your fun. Im a jack of all trades character after accumulating enough points to move stuff around and have several different load outs. Ive been preparing for this since the beginning so I wouldn't get bored. Sadly I made this assumption when I still though Beth was a smarter game studio than they've proven. Now I'm constantly bursting at the seams with loot and I can't even sell any of it because everyone has this same issue.
---
The thing is though that it is an amazing game. The flaws still need to be addressed with mediums like reddit, but we can't forget what games have always been about. Its about fun! I know its cliche, but this about us as gamers. When we let the gaming studios irritate us it can seep into the community. 
---
So my advice, dwellers. Let it go. To the ground or to some lower level player. They may or may not find use for it, but at least its away from you. And after awhile it gets easier to let the loot go. We've become callused to the joy this game brings; but if you cut out the cancer, see the bigger picture its all worth it again. Because we are what make the game worth playing. Not the atom shop, not the loot, but the fun and friends that we make along the way
---
No they do not stack, only timer reset
---
Not even once.. tadpoles honor
---
Very few are engaged in pvp because the pvp aspect was gutted. ????
---
Pvp needs participation trophies, like NW afk simulator, that are attractive enough to entice Pve players to engage in pvp playstyle.
---
I'd support the game, not the players
---
It's 600 I think. But yeah I also finally gave in,after 2 years.
---
I think most of want a “put away your Tesla” emote.
---
Great post! It’s save people the trouble of having to move worlds of their camps don’t load in and it’d make moving camps easier
---
You can switch it from that view back to the original pip boy veiw
---
What I do is update the build.  Delete the old bookmark and just make a new one.  Never have a problem with doing it like that.
---
yes, but each time you make any chance, you have to copy the new URL. Eample: check out the differences between these two both in their URL and what they contain

---
Thanks for the heads up! That's a bundle worth 600 caps if I ever saw one. More skulls for my pirate ship.
---
Pets are coming to camps
---
Yup I def bought this one. Use to not buy camp items and just outfits once my atoms got high. But I wanna start building amazing camps like I see so these camp bundles are awesome to see.
---
atoms dont carry over between launchers for PC
---
Bloodied melee. Been able to handle most the damage on my own as long as I use stims. 
---
Sry wasn’t me that downvoted
---
Better than it used to be though
---
That's just a mod with different steps.
---
Saw the posts about the sale, realized I had 1200 atoms waiting for a good deal. Now I have 600 atoms and a heck of a lot of skulls to place on my pirate ship.
---
Shit up this vote!
---
All good, you can join me I run earle all the time, we'll most likely 2 man him most of time. But my group hops on at all different times. Can you run silos if I'm on cool down (nw if not)
---
This happened to me a long while back with other games and I can only suggest you do a real deep virus scan. You might even have a rootkit. They could have gotten various passwords and even have access to your email without you knowing too; to this day, years later, I'm still finding old accounts that were stolen for games I forgot I played, such as WOW. It's probably not that, but it can be a real pain if you don't catch it early, remove the virus/rootkit, and then change all your passwords.
---
It would suck if you got your account back, after a long fight, and then they just reset the password using your own email and changed the address again. 76 has a valuable weapons market that makes it desirable to steal accounts from.
---
that's the thing, the legendary system they've built pretty much promotes transferring things to different characters with different builds... even more so if you're into trading
---
I had an inventory organizer mod and the only issue I had was that it became incompatible and j couldn't log in until I uninstalled it. 
---
If you're using mods that affect actual gameplay or give you a benefit, you might risk a ban, but there are so many people using QoL mods right now, there would be a huge backlash if they did a blanket ban. 
---
Plenty of games have ways to stop you from modding an online experience. They've chosen not to use those methods here.
---
Up shit vote this
---
keep doing raider dailies, until you crawl your way up to Allies. it will take a while
---
I agree that it would be an ideal place, or also for non-hostile ghouls
---
If they are talking about the one I'm thinking of, yeah. It has the ability to quickly swap between perk profiles so you can slot in your lock picking/hacking/crafting or just entirely different builds as needed.
---
Ive played alot as a commando with Uny/Sent sets and power armour with Dodgy/EProtocols and I promise you that the PA is tougher
---
thank you, I knew it was something dumb like this. Didn't notice that the link changed with every change.
---
yes, you can sell T-60 PA plans. main thing is trying to find someone who has a set for sale
---
thank you! understood how it works now
---
Idea: Make all 5 characters look the same and wear the same outfit. That way, you can have a camp full of 'Garys'
---
They've talked about having pets in the camp, I guess they're working on it
---
HAha but you can only build one bro
---
You could also grind out Distant Thunder when it pops up. I routinely put them in my vendor when I get them. Granted it will cost you a pretty penny for the parts :)
---
I agree.  It needs to be done by bethesda and be server-specific + friends list.
---
what was yesterday's bundle?
---
build/perks and knowing which weapon is most effective against which enemy goes a long way.
---
and for “bullet sponge” enemies, stacking chems for bonus damage.
---
For example, I have 3 different weapons with ghoul slayer prefix.  An SS switchblade, explosive 10mm, and explosive minigun.
---
All 3 work, but only one of those weapons can 1 hit kill them.  And that one is the switchblade.   I’m a melee build with glowsight3, incisor3, And martial artist3 (amongst others).
---
Sure, I have tank killer and ground pounder, and stabilized, but those dont buff the ballistic damage to anywhere near what the melee perks do for the switchblade.
---
Looks like it'll be one right on the counter of the donut vendor then. No one can possibly miss it there! 
---
Edit: Just placed the smoke machine on top of the robot's head. It fits perfectly and looks really stupid. Couldn't be happier.
---
Ok, thank you, I am understanding you correctly then.   
---
I wanted clarity whether it was your comprehension that was at fault or mine.   
---
It's not mine.   
---
I'm sorry that you find it bothersome to explain, I was just trying to establish whether:
---
1. You'd misunderstood the OP or weren't able to get your head around the technical issue that exists
---
2. Were going off on a weird unrelated tangent
---
3. Whether I was not understanding your original response correctly.  
---
It's the first two.  I was asking questions before jumping in and suggesting you'd misunderstood or were trolling.  
---
I'm not sure what aspect it is you're not understanding, but for clarity, when all is working correctly you can play on the same server as friends, not be on a team with them, then jump to a different friends server when you want to play with them.  
---
Playing in a team has nothing to do with the friends list bug. (Well, there can be functional side effects to the bug as well), but the bug prevents your friends list showing up at all, it means to accept friend requests, for trading etc. someone has to send you a request at least twice, sometimes far more than that before it shows up. It means if you're on a private world, friends get kicked off of it after 30+ seconds. It means the friends list shows up blank every time you log in.
---
If you have the few rewards from completing the event there's no incentive to gather ore.
---
You get better drops and xp from killing mobs.  Since gathering all the ore ends the event - we are actually better off not gathering.
---
At this point, I don't expect people to get ore at all.
---
This is a gripe I have...oh unyielding metal with wwr nice..now how the hell do I see if it's a left leg or a arm.
---
That funky scarlet sniper outfit. I would have bought the lever gun skin that came with it on its own, but I would never wear that outfit and it was not a very good sale price. The Pioneer Scout paint is the best one for the lever gun anyway, if they ever sell it again...
---
It's possible on PC, but not on consoles unfortunately.
---
No it isn't. It's good for killing trash mobs. You'll be hitting Earle for slap damage. Idk what the other posters are smoking
---
Saw a similar post earlier this week, someone replied with try getting rid of holotapes and notes.
---
Yup, pacifist was on. Could've been I guess, but I'm pretty sure what I saw flash in front of me was a gauntlet.
---
There should be a marker.  Even if you sink them, you have to interact with whatever dumpster it sends you to.  It can be one of several, so make sure you're not overlooking a marker absurdly far away.
---
If I could give you gold bullion I would.
---
Yeah I feel you. With me when I got to the PA room she wouldn't open the door so I had to start all over. Take a deep breath, go do other quests. events, farm resources, craft. When you come back you'll be stronger and better equipped and you will own that assaultrons ass.
---
It will have 1-3 stars and will list various effects relative to the number of stars. Things like "damage increases during night time" and "ignores 50% of your target's armor."
---
First of all thanks for your reply, i didn't know this was a thing.
---
Second, Wait what? I mean it's the same game, the same character it does not make any sense to me  :(
---
Unfortunately,there's no good build for that.
---
You will be very disappointed launching mini nuke all over the place just to see that you have done nothing but cool noise.
---
I used to get a few of my accounts hack attempt logins from Russia and other countries until I enabled 2 step verification on most of my accounts and it stopped happening after a few months lol they gave up.
---
Yah
---
Yes! That light is so bright and has such a great range.
---
Let me hold your handmade so I can dupe it!I swear I wont block you afterwords!
---
Yah I’ll be able to. Little low on nuke cards but that shouldn’t be too big a deal. Just need to take some time to refill and buy some more
---
Yeah I saw some of that here. Ironic.
---
what are you talking about? fallout 76 has extraordinary loading screens, from pressing "run" on steam i can be in game in less than 20 seconds.
---
Unless you're running it off an HDD i can't imagine how slower it can be
---
Soooo.. how do you know that guy was from Russia?
---
Super mutants or fissure sites
---
In one of the last interviews with the developers, they talk about having several allies in the camp to make it feel more alive, I guess they are working on it
---
My biggest concern is One Wasteland.  I’m in a low level zone. Ami to expect level 50 liberators attacks while I’m away?
---
Unlucky I don’t have one :( sad Jew noises
---
Oh I gotchu on cards just need to be able to go through the silo 🤗
---
Yah, it helps a ton to have a team of shotgunners running around executing the wendigos while the heavies blast away at Earle. 
---
Exactly. The wendigos look a lot more sterile than rotting zombies!
---
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Okilee dokilee thank you
---
I've turned off every quest and have nothing on the compass when I 360 around. Not like I even began the quest with a lower agility to glitch myself into this position. Did it all in one quick run sneaky sneaky round the lake and avoided everything using stealthboys to get close and not alert all the mirelurks around them.
---
Yeah it’s annoying .. but I swear most of you want the game to hold your hand all the way through . If she don’t land get strong enough to kill that b**ch in the air lol
---
how about instead of removing them, buff them to make them more desirable? (BTW. i love my -90% weight guns)
---
😂🤣😂🤣 Epic haha.
---
Ah yes, a Compagnon is very needed
---
yet still no transfer between toons, what this thread was about...
---
oooof man I hope that never happens :c
---
God damn I wish I was good enough to do the event
---
Too many items in inventory.
---
Drop notes/holotapes/plans
---
How much we talking here? I'm willing to spend the caps if I need to lol
---
It also does 9 damage and is weaker than using fists.
---
Serendipity does this.
---
You are not alone with that.
---
If you start the game via Beth's launcher your atoms should still be there. Each fucking launcher has it's own wallet.
---
same thing happened to me, was already in PA and tried to enter the PA in the room, forever stuck walking towards the PA...FML, had to alt+f4 and restart the quest.
---
Shotgun build.
---
Melee build on an alternate
---
What you want is what pvp was like when the game launched. You can thank the pve players for getting this removed
---
Laser weapons and I think the flamer, Tesla and alien pistol. Plasma will make goo.
---
If a q/ffr fixer can outperform a b/ffr fixer backed by a good build, I’ll eat my work boots.  It’ll never happen, even after the new math.

It's wise to check between Beth launcher and steam. What was happening for a bit was atoms earned in one would go to the other. I went to Beth launcher and had about 1000 just sitting there without knowing.
---
For me, she froze when climbing out of the vent, so never opened the door. After looking up the many complaints about this glitchy room I found the wall clip glitch so I could glitch through the door and take the helmet, then quit out of the game. I restarted the mission, skipped the room and thankfully completed it with no further issues.
---
They're not moving up. All the damage goes down but you get armor pen. Should be around net 0
---
Thank you man, at least i'm not alone in this nonsense joke
---
Mods often have to be updated when the game is updated in order to stay compatible. There is a very helpful inventory mod that still works.
---
V94 will be open as a daily op. Idk if that fits the unique experience criteria but there it is. You'll also be able to visit it and roam without it being a daily op.
---
Oh ok! Yah that’d be great. I have a friend that can help as well when we need it. He’s a stealth build though so he doesn’t usually get to shine in ACP 😅
---
No worries I will include my paypal and for a small fee of only 49.99 I will show you my secret methods!
---
DR is a honeypot. Huge diminishing returns. Other than jetpack, no reason to ever run SS outside PVP.
---
WoW is balanced to the core, in 12 years playing I never get my bank full. WoW gives you numerous ways to reach a result. I don't need to be in a  constantly time-consuming thing like grinding for ammo, doing the exact  same boring thing every day, so I can be out there exploring doing a more exciting stuff. Fallout needs to abandon some mechanics in name of  others, once again it all comes down to balance. Why offers a 50%  discount in the Purveyor if you can't sell the excess, and you will  eventually get over cumbered leading the game to be unplayable (Its  happening to me right now)? They created so many paywalls that they are  just stuck there, is the only mechanic they have for everything. Fallout  is no mobile game.
---
And they do aggro after a certain point.
---
Issue is still there. I’m just so frustrated with quests that can’t be completed due to glitches.
---
So not explosive?
---
Ok cool
---
What’s “one wasteland?”
---
Thanks, I didn't know about tank killer changes, that should at least help a bit
---
Really wish that door came with the bundle. It's so cool!!
---
None of the plans are unobtainable, just a matter of How much time it will take you to gain the reputation with either faction to gain access to the plan.
---
(Then raising the bullion to buy it)
---
As your reputation rises, Some plans will start appearing in faction vendors for caps (plans for bows, crossbows, and arrow types, for example).
---
There’s at least one plan that if for a specific reason, you are not awarded the item for completing a specific mission, you will be able to purchase the plan with caps.
---
BUT if you dont buy it for caps when it becomes available, and then you complete the 79 raid, if you decide you want that item, the caps option gone - you’ll have to buy that item for bullion (4000 bullion, IIRC)
---
Two shot with MIRV mod is pretty fun.
---
When you get to the dumpster, press "R" or whatever the transfer button is if you're on console. That'll automatically deposit the barrels and complete the event.
---
Ima having that problem too, let me know if you figure it out
---
I'm a stealth build, and I've dropped him in about 11 secs
---
Gt? I'll add you
---
dunno about gamepass PC.. but when it went on steam they stated atoms will not transfer but the items you buy with atoms do.. so youre not really losing anything
---
its like having 2 wallets
---
I have no idea, but best thing right now to do is to favorite it so it gives you a prompt before you sell it.
---
How is taking water, that respawns every other minute, bad behavior?
---
With the tiny storage limits, the average player has probably missed out on millions of pure waters. What's another 2?
---
?? What’re you trying to say ..
---
Yeah, I mean.. role play team? I never see anyone doing that. Also hunting team is fun but it's hard to find legendaries like that too... Maybe I'm doing it wrong. But I hear what you're saying too
---
That's not open world that's an MMO.    
---
There are consequences to anything and the solo Fallout games are no exception. The only difference is all the enemies are a computer program while 76 has that and characters controlled by real people.    
---
You shouldn't lose anything that's on a char or in a stash. The last two......are part of most MMOs with pvp. It's also realistic and part of a post apocalyptic world. Adapt or die. Simple.
---
Sweet
---
If they shut it down, they should make it an expansion for FO4.
---
no, explosive weapons are fine.
---
Not new maps.
---
Not new content.
---
Not bug fixes. 
---
Lights.
---
Smileys reset changed from Saturday to Monday.  
---
IDK about installmanet purchases - I’ve always bought the max amount each time.
---
Yeah I started late so I guess by the time I got into it PvP was just odd like it is now..
---
Yes and I hit distant thunder to collect them, they are quite rare so when I get a spare part plan I sell it for 5k always sells too so it is one of my few sources of cap income.
---
I love everything about this post
---
Yeah that's a cool idea! Exile the griefers, I love it!
---
I love this idea so much! My headcanon is that my characters all either left 76 together or met each other in their travels so it'd be so nice to have everyone at camp together.
---
It's one of the reasons I always discourage using steam to play fo76.
---
I did try that before posting. Says quest items can't be removed 😂 May as well give up with the quests in this game, I've had at least one glitch each day since Wednesday. Considering I'm only on my 9th day of playing, it isn't looking good for my future in the wasteland.
---
Just what we need, more toons in our camp that block the workbenches. One ally is already bad, but 4??? Hell no.
---
I agree with your analogy but in D&amp;D and especially in games the dungeon master/game designer needs to create a system that rewards or punishes desired or undesired behavior. The fact is Fallout universe has always had good and bad guys. 76 was supposed to create that dynamic with PvP and the wanted system. I think stealing a few pieces of junk or collectron stuff and becoming wanted is sort of a good balance for what you end up losing if your killed. (The junk and some caps).
---
I think being an arse hole would be better defined by someone who's screaming really loudly on mic or sleeping in ones bed, etc. Things that can't be countered by the player effectively.
---
The short of it is 76 has failed to create a system that discourages bad behavior. Instead, they've patched out most the griefing tactics. That's like a dungeon master saying idc what you're character is you're going to be nice and never hurt anyone even if they want it.
---
He's not complaining, he'd just like a reliable way to force Scorchbeasts down while playing a shotgun or melee build. I agree with him that it'd be nice...not necessary, but nice.
---
The other main problem I have with base defense is that barriers, walls, and locks are irrelevant, since enemies can spawn anywhere, such as inside a 3rd floor locked room, and perhaps they can teleport also.
---
Enemies need to spawn outside the camp or workshop perimeter, and turrets need quickly fire on any enemy who gets within a certain distance of the perimeter.
---
Camp defense is going to get messy after one wasteland hits.
---
Yeah same here.. I don't have the weapons, perks or armor to compete with the "player killers" since I play for fun on a more casual level so it feels really unbalanced and takes most of the fun out of it
---
well im sorry u feel that way, i hope u find some other threads that make ur reddit experience feel more worthwhile👍
---
I'm still trying to get the Fixer plan :/
---
this is always me
---
Not until we get another 5 or 6 super sledge and handmade skins.
---
Was the container unlocked?  If so, then it’s fair to assume it’s left unlocked intentionally and the owner is fine with people collecting it. 
---
Was the container locked?  Then it’s fair to assume the **owner** wants those items and you’re stealing. 
---
Stealing is bad behavior.
---
Fight is hard for sure, if you were on ps4, I'd have offered to tag along and help out
---
Confirmed fix for Playstation as well.  Thanks!
---
Some day I wanna do Scorched Earth where the entire server joins and only uses Fat Mans
---
I believe I finally figured it out...looks like you need plans for the medium generator.  They can be found by reading “schematics” at Miguel’s terminal at Morgantown Airport or as a reward from the powering up event at one of the three power plants.
---
Stop selling common plans people! Some camp are just wasteland IKEAs!  
---
I only sell armor or weapon plans, some i remember i had difficulties to find.
---
True, I did think of this though. Give them points to go to, for example in FO4 when you allocated someone to a guard post they stayed there.
---
What the hell are you talking about. All of that was gutted from the game. Nobody can steal your stash.
---
Go play fortnight
---
Honey and jetpack my friend, honey and jetpack.
---
Just because there isn’t a system in place to discourage bad behavior doesn’t mean that bad behavior is then considered acceptable. 
---
I don’t care if OP wants to steal from camps. It’s part of the game. 
---
The issue is trying to justify it under the guise of *‘I’m just role playing my character, guys!’*
---
This quest triggers too early and I've seen plenty of low levels go in there and get absolutely demolished. I feel like this one and Sophia's shouldn't trigger until you're at least level 30-40.
---
This I did not know, appreciate your reply. 👍
---
For 80 cents? Nope, thanks!!!
---
After a few tries, this 100% worked!  Thanks
---
Sounds like your controls are inverted. Check under settings &gt; game
---
That's the default setting. Most view controls are "inverted". You can disable this is in the settings menu.
---
I like that we feel like we need to wave with how Beth can make profits from an idea, but I totally get it and agree. This is a very cool, realistic and simple idea.
---
Patched out
---
legacy explosive lasers/plasmas will also trigger it
---
I'm on PS4, so it takes a while.
---
I mean, originally it was a unique experience and already had it's own lore and reasons why the specific enemy types were in it.  But yall had to ruin that
---
Ye,it’s mad annoying...I ended up using the work light type spotlights,&amp; they never power down &amp; seem to do the same thing,from what I can tell.
---
When I didn’t have em up,w/e would just walk up &amp; smash my missile turret to oblivion,but wit em up,they seem to do there job fairly well.
---
I guess they would just "respawn" just like how your camp already does. It wouldn't be re-placing like how the blueprints work
---
Sounds like they moved your character with a melee attack into a legacy punji board trap.
---
GG
---
Or!
---
Your game glitched out because pvp doesn't make you disconnect or make map markers fly around the screen
---
Even just have his themes that can be unlocked with each faction and for other events in game. Maybe a Fallout 1st hud and some atom ones also. Score rewards.
---
It was unique in a bad way.
---
Why do people in the fo76 community delete their posts so quickly? Especially when there's on 1 reply so far.
---
Either leave your thought up if you thought it was so important to post, or at least think about it awhile longer if it's actually worth bringing up.
---
Huh, that doesn't make sense. As long as you have all the barrels you should just interact with the dumpster and it'll automatically deposit them. You don't do it from your inventory. Maybe you didn't pick up every barrel? Never heard of this issue.
---
Mater of opinion, does not change the fact what I said was true
---
Was "shit down" an intended typo? lmao
---
Yes lol
---
It happens to one of my ps4 controller and I have a original controller from the first model ps4 so it’s good to have a back or a older ps4 or Xbox controller for the first models
---
No 3rd party mod is something that many people want to stay away from and can contain unwanted parts in it. Editing ini file manually does not.
---
I’m assuming you mean the furious combat rifle? Because it is available.
---
Yeah she never even opened the door for me. Definitely skip this, its basically a trap.
---
The US government has warned against its use, I would not use Kaspersky. They’ve banned its use in government settings as well.
---
Bear arms is a complete waste of 3 points for just a single weapon
---
You do realize it’s still going to output the most damage right?
---
Linking to a closed off spreadsheet? What's that going to prove?
---
They also won't truly understand it by playing,because they won't have access to week 2 ghoul boss fight,which closes the circle about what happened to the raiders and geck.
---
Ah ok Sorry I read that wrong nvm.  Best save that for someone who needs it, mostly looking for killer shotguns:)
---
Ehhhh....
---
It's hard to justify that pricepoint for a bunch of totems imo
---
oh snap I didn't think of that.  Too bad I learned all those lead pipe, hunting rifle, rolling pin sickle and countless other sub par weapon plans!  
---
Oh wait, I never had a choice in learning those plans before they started diluting the loot drop pools for me and every single other person playing this game...
---
It works on both.
---
Go to Beth's official forum, there are workarounds for this.
---
Alternatively you can always delete the game and install it fresh on your system drive.
---
This has been my number 1 request since the game came out.    It exists in 4 - this should be a no brainer.
---
Just suggesting what's associated with the weapon. I don't really know much about using just one heavy weapon.
---
You can get them on eBay for 10 bucks........I wish I was kidding.
---
The second question is: Does it renew by shooting at the enemy again? Or is it a 1 time debuff to that single enemy untill it lives?
---
Awesome idea. I've moved my long standing camp today and had instant regret! Being able to at least recover your previous camp would be welcomed by me!
---
I bought it for the smoke machine alone, but there are actually some very nice lights, torches and a lamp included I can see myself using. It's just wood stuff, nothing that screams "I'm a psycho murder cultist" about them.
---
Yo, for real. This and the black powder robot challenges are definitely not worth it.
---
please tell me what part of my comment had anything to do with YOU.
---
its just a circlejerk post, nothing here is remotely worth reporting to reddit, the choices are A its a dupers garbage, or B, its atlas garbage, either way, its still nothing more than someone dropping their garbage because of game limitations, not because they feel like being nice.
---
I remember when that first released. I regretted not getting it. Thanks for the update.
---
The Water Wheel didn't work after a week or so for 4 weeks straight. 
---
also there are almost every week false Advertisings. check the preview for the items, there are always related things in the screen to trick us customers to think they are inside the bundle aswell. 
---
also, most of the Power Armor skins are unusable since the left arm is blocking 1/3 of the screen. the 20/30€ pack we got with wastelanders featuring the Settler Power armor has such a low resolution, the whole game looks 8k compared to it.

and so on. the very first false advertise we got was the collectors edition which should came in a nice canvas bag. if you don't know what happen, just search for "fallout 76 canvas" on youtube or anywhere else :D
---
Yeah I just realized that. Well, I guess i'll install it on C. But damn it's 2020 why is this a restriction? No other game I own has this issue. WTF Bethesda? They are the biggest "workaround" devs I've ever seen. Their entire engine is run on workarounds. Lazy!
---
You're describing Fallout 4.
---
The modding community would probably end up making a mod with Apalachia in it.
---
I get the ores and the legendaries lagging in the depth.  
---
Never seen any rare rewards though...
---
The geck room is being pulled? That's disappointing to hear.  Hopefully they move that halo tape elsewhere so that story loop has an end again.
---
I just join to farm XP
---
While I’ve still not done much of those quest lines,when I inquired essentially the same thing...
---
It was suggested to me,that you should do both quest lines all the way up to where you have to make “The Choice”,pick who ya want,&amp; grind the other,but ultimately In the end you can have both &amp; reap all benefits.
---
At least that’s how I understood it anyhow
---
Yes. But not the same special twice.
---
EDIT: The opened legendary perk slots are account wide. So you only have to unlock them with one character. But legendary perk are not shared between characters.
---
You can, you unlock a slot for legendary perks every 50 levels- up to a max of 6 slots. Edit: Woops, I thought you meant two legendary perks at once, lol. But yeah, you can equip different special cards- just not two of the same like other guy said
---
Yup ! Removing the Custom.ini and mods, also there is one mods that can fuck this, iconSortingTags, because this mods act like a patch for two original .ba2 file (interface and another one can't remember) so the best thing to do is a backup of original file and swapping them when you planning to play in NW
---
You cannot reach complete invincibility or complete debuff with perks that's for sure and tested. Obviously spamming healing item makes you invincible but this is not what we're talking about.
---
There is always a cap ,and some enemies are strong enough ,or in great numbers, to be dangerous even at that cap.
---
Plasma cores are way easier to make in bulk.
---
I stopped playing this game almost a month ago, and I had been pvping for almost a year. I started pvping because the PvE side of this game wasn't appealing to me anymore. But I still wanted to find a fun aspect in this game that would motivate me to keep playing it, and that aspect was PvP. People I talk to always make the argument that PvPers take the fun away from the PvErs and I always laugh at that because they think saying that puts them in the right. But because they constantly complain about PvP, it's caused the fun to be "taken away" from people who enjoy PvP and people who don't want to deal with Bethesda's sh**ty PvE systems and rng. If you don't want someone to attack you or initiate PvP, then turn on passive ffs. And there's this amazing feature that exists on Xbox and PS4 socials that's called a "block" button. Even 76 has its own block feature. This is why I don't understand Bethesda's decision to not condone "griefing" because it's so easily avoidable and preventable that they shouldn't even have to mention it. There's so much more I have to say about this but these are the main things I have problems with.
---
I've met the woman too last week i think
---
Legacy plasmas don't.  They make goo
---
tbf it's too bright in places in 76, in FO4 especially with the mod it had good range and wasn't blinding
---
Scrap junk items (it takes up less space that way), bulk it at a tinker bench, and sell to bot vendors. 
---
Most mats are relatively easy to come by (even fusion cores), and there are not that many you’ll need more than 50 of to continue progressing right along.
---
Weight reduction perks only count towards what you are carrying, not what’s in your stash.
---
  If you have collected Power armor pieces - check their level - most of them you cannot use until you are L30+ so they are taking up a lot of stash space.  You may be better off scrapping them.  
---
Stuff in vendors takes up stash space.  Consider reducing prices for faster sales, or taking the heavy stuff to a bot vendor.
---

---
Have fun probably one of the best mods so far, you also need SFE to save your build. 10 builds can be save, enough for team/solo build, traveling one, crafting one and much more, i doubt Bethesda can do a better thing then this mods sadly...
---
Because of English bands in the 70's and 80's. Probably how we've learned 99% of English slang. That and late night PBS in the 90's played all the English comedy from Are You Being Served, Father Ted, Mr. Bean, Faulty Towers (Flowery Twats) and the OG Dr. Who, and Monty Python. The best television ever made and ever will be made.
---
You miss out alot of armor penetration and a some hip fire accuracy.
---
Edit: thanks to u/zenrar who corrected me
---
I don't know really ,but you sure won't fight the named legendary ghouls who were raid leaders.And finding a random geck laptop without the context of closing it to prevent radiation ,is quite pointless.
---
I know it makes no sense, that's why I decided to YouTube a walkthrough and then come here asking for advice when that also didn't work 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
There are 3 separate toxic barrels with the diamond in my misc tab, no marker on the compass, just the text on the right telling me to dump the barrels. Does the fact that I picked the 'daily' up 2 days ago but never began it make a difference? The time didn't begin until I grabbed the first barrel
---
I’m a junkie PA user, but i rarely use it outside of Earle and Scorch Queen. I don’t have any issues without it.
---
We might as well skip all the baby steps and just implement a Global Auction House.
---
What do you play on?
---
in all fairness, this one is not on Beth, but a limitation of Windows. There is a workaround.
---
They are gonna make mobs lvl based on the player, a lvl 20 and a lvl200 can be fighting the same enemy and both will be fighting an appropriate lvl foe. This is going to make all areas of the map viable, explorable for any lvl. There are bonuses and drawbacks for this though. No longer able to power lvl people, all the mobs taking more bullets to kill and doing more damage therefore drawing on resources more. High lvl camps in low lvl areas will now have to deal with higher lvl mobs. But high lvl folks will be able to go back to lower lvl areas and it will be worthwhile because of higher lvl gear drops and xp.
---
Oh, woops, sorry about that. I changed the permission settings, [here it is again](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f4dDlj-2q24GIUeAeQKp2lNhvjy-T4vlEcHux3Y6YEk/edit?usp=sharing).
---
True ! But actually i didn't really found a mod that give an enormous advantage, easy picklock or hacking, glowing items ? (Idk maybe) 
---
Third party tools can ban you easily instead of mods, there was one popular but the creator stop is development (good think at least ! Because this is completely cheat)
---
Just have both
---
Defenses are probably shit on purpose to make you grind more for repairs.
---
When you bring up your pipboy just click the touch pad in. It'll switch back. I prefer the PA view tbh.
---
I run vamp, ricochet, dodgy, empath fully boosted, and emergency protocols.  It's so great.
---
This vote shit up
---
my attitude is not accepting what i think is wrong.
---
your attitude is to defend a company which is delivering a terrible product along false advertisements. if this should be the standard for online games in your opinion... well, we would be screwed. there is a reason Bethesda got more lawsuits for one game then other publishers ever had in their existence. there is a reason why Fallout 76 has such a bad reputation and underwhelming scores from either the users and gaming journalists.
---
i can only repeat my previous comment right here.
---
\*armor penetration and accuracy. reload speed is a separate card in strength.
---
Small correction that doesn't really matter but still, at levels 50, 75, 100, 150, 200 and 300.
---
I just want to be able to have a red lamp on my Excavator.  
---
Why doesn't the Excavator have any of the headlamp options?
---
and once your done with wasteland quests, making npc angry really doesn't matter if anything it's free experience, looking at you whitespring sentry bots
---
Eh, I have bad luck with drops too, don't worry lol. Only reason I can solo her is I got a Lvl35 magic minigun. And even then, it takes a bit of ammo and time.
---
I've got two bloodied characters, and I've never once gotten a bloodied drop for either of their respective weapons on any of my 5 characters, lol. And my main character has some okay heavy guns, but usually I find supressor's or medic's.
---
I can honestly say you have fantastic taste in tv programs sir
---
Yes, sorr, thanks for correcting me.
---
Oh, really? That I did not know, haha.
---
Hey man we can't help it, we just always want more lol
---
It's not the same result at all.
---
Not necessarily.
---
i see people run around outside their pa all the time &amp; use heavy. i’ve never done it myself but i’d assume it’s viable
---
Old area. Old enemies. New dance.
---
The best is a quad double barrel, the fastest and it just needed 6 extra bullet in.  
---
Present yourself sneaking in front of a mireluk queen, unload 7 bullets and it's dead in 2 seconds.  
---
Hop they fix this (only saying that to them not fixing anything)
---
Ty
---
Elaborate.
---
IIRC, the only way to get the plans for Excavator is to complete the various steps of the miner miracles questline.  THere are multiple steps within the quest, and the step before registering the helmet is the one that awards the plans.
---
You build the armor, then are tasked with registering the helmet.
---
If you don’t register the helmet, you can still use the PA, but you don’t get the carry weight and mining bonus.
---
and you can still complete the Intermediate steps to get the plans.
---
But as soon as you register the helmet, it completes the full quest, and awards the PA workstation.  You cannot go back and do the intermediate step to get the plan.
---
I never use PA because it gives me motion sickness even with the PA hud turned off. My heavy guns character seems to do just fine...just gotta suck it up and wear the Excavator suit to get that sweet lead lol
---
i got a quad double barrel, it's the best of all my shotguns just because it's way too fast than the others and the bullets flow... In vats.
---
All jokes aside-I agree. Have spoken to a few lower level players who were unaware that the ammo generator was not only an exploit but also could screw with your CAMP budget. I’ve also seen players on XB groups literally building these for caps. 
---
I don’t think a lot of non-reddit people are even aware it’s an issue.
---
&gt;No mods needed, just gotta mod your game
---
There is no other game I have this issue with. It's not a limitation of Windows.
---
Yes but make sure you do the quests for both up until the siding quest. The overseer recommends it herself.
---
There are so many good weight reduction perks it doesn't really bother me.  Especially with legendary specials coming weight reduction that way is easy.
---
Spent 2 hours this morning rebuilding my camp for the 1000th time because I like building new camps.
---
As you explore and follow the overseers original questline, you will find holotapes and notes that give you a lot of background and personal stories.
---
Don't sell it, it's the best, it's a monster for now.
---
Currently no need for Power Armors outside of Scorched Earth or Colossal Problem Public Events.
---
with update 22 next Thursday you will most likely use a Power Armor 24/7 if you don't have the perfect weapons in hand instantly. You can expect a overall damage down of something like 50-75%, depending on build and equipment. Oneshotting a single Super Mutant will require decent Equipment.
---
Lol amazing that you are the first person to point that out. 
---
No. No it was not.
---
And what do you gain? I'm using my own time to educate this community on glitched weapons. Yay, you must be so proud to be important for once and get someone's post for fake internet points removed. You proud of yourself, now? I would go on a tangent here, but I've already wasted enough time here as is.
---
Ahh, thanks. I thought i had a bug or something 😂 for som reason my frames are fucked with the ordinary pipboy but with pa pipboy my frames are fine
---
Fixers take more time to reload than to empty a clip - commandos literally spend more time reloading than firing. If you've got speed demon, bloodied will be 0.77% ahead of quad so you don't have to eat your work boots (barely). Without speed demon quad wins by almost 9%. This assumes you're still a bloodied build, just running a quad instead of a bloodied weapon, so you still get the benefits from nerd rage, etc.
---
The true best way is to have a friend you can actually trust help you.
---
Yep, i used all of them, the quad double B is the fastest so... the best.
---
I've been spending a lot of my time recently making nice mobile camp shop designs and just farming and selling tons of chems, of course hitting any of the good events and checking other people's camps out. I've got my own daily checklist in my head of things I wanna do and farm that usually take up plenty of my time.
---
With slightly lowered benefits because canned food doesn't taste good
---
The ideal thing is to get it above 75 quickly to get the good mobs, but don't take it to 100 until the timer is almost finished.
---
Man there are soooo many flat spots.
---
Ignorant question from someone who has never done line in the sand: why are ash piles bad?
---
What language is this in?
---
none. not worth for the next two days, with update 22 they will be both literally unsusable.  
---
gatling plasma (bloodied explosive) got nerfed by 75%, gatling laser with equal stats got nerfed by 60%.
---
if you ask me, stick to lmg or gauss minigun/shotgun.
---
Or even make the prefabs able to sit on foundations or snap to them, I could make my RR look so much better
---
Nothing is "yours" until you yourself loot it. I was wrong to say that.
---
Your account didn't get hacked.  You either got phished or downloaded a keylogger or any of the other many ways your credentials can be compromised outside of Bethesda's control.  Yes it's semantics, but it's an important distinction.
---
It's like the recent news of Microsoft stopping Russian hackers from attacking political campaigns... which actually amounted to Microsoft's email filters catching a bunch of phishing attempts.
---
I’d be happy about  a gold press machine in the wayward And a press machine + a couple of workbenches in v79.
---
I feel your pain, scrapped my leather coat one week ago...
---
You uncultured swine lol
---
And if someone puts up the 'Come Here' emote to indicate a legendary, 2 scavengers will dies as everyone abandons the other side entirely.
---
Stealing is a game mechanic that incurs a built-in reprocussion system. It is no longer bad behavior because the game is already handling it.
---
Stealing in real life is different, because you aren't immediately flagged by the planet as a "wanted" person the second you commit a crime.
---
Not to mention, you don't own anything in the game, other than your lease to the game install.
---
Yes, but the idea was that this model PipBoy is supposed to be less advanced.
---
Yeah I had the same problem w the game pass version I tried the custom ini work around and it kept saying I had modded files so I reinstalled on C
---
I feel like that's something you have to figure out on your own. If you've done everything and tried many different things and still can't find enjoyment, then maybe the game just isn't for you. I know that's not what you want to hear and it sucks to realize but sometimes that's just how it is.
---
As for me, I like not having a routine and all. Some players have a plan, they log in and do their dailies, scrip, gold bullion, grind rep, legendary farm, do events, etc. Not me, I just log in and see where the game ends up taking me. Sometimes I do work around my camp if I picked up some new plans. Sometimes I make my way around the map and farm legendaries while picking up every piece of scrap I see. And sometimes I just explore and look for interesting photo mode locations. I played for like 2 hours once where all I did was use the prosnap camera to take pictures of other players doing stuff. You talk about needed to be told what to do and I mean, 76 is constantly throwing stuff at you to do so there's always something going on.
---
Hacks!
---
Jk 😂
---
Are you looking for the plans to build it yourself, or you just want the prices of armor?
---
I for almost a year and couple months had my camps right below Welch then I decided to move all the way up to top right  of the map. Prob the worst spot to pick being most of my land is down in a valley type mountain. So laying prefabs suck. Just haven’t got around to Moving it all. I plan to move prob to whitesprings or on top of mountains so I can use my sweet sweet camp bundles I’ve been buying lately
---
Vote this shit up! 😐
---
Or changeable lights for the clean miners helmet
---
Very nice they are worth like 10 to 12k caps each or you have to buy them in the story for like 17k I think
---
Same as everything else. Damage changes are not really gun specific. Expect about a 40-50% reduction.
---
Everyone is getting nerfed the same.  Bloodied will still be the best build. Anti armor and two shot explosive will do close to same damage.  Instead of 2 or 3 shots it'll be 3 to 5 on same super mutants.
---
Are viable, but you'll notice the lack of accuracy with no PA
---
I think what you are asking for is give us more convenient flat space.   
---
There are tons and tons of flat space areas however the majority is out of the way in obscure places or what you might think to far for people to want to travel.    
---
Flat plus water is rare, flat plus water plus resource is even rarer but does exist.
---
Like everything else on the internet, the people with negative issues have something to actually say and discuss. If I think everything is great it doesn’t really make for a good post. I think most people on this sub have positive things about the game but also have things they wish to be fixed.
---
I’ve already said that because it’s a game mechanic it’s allowed. 
---
I’ve also said that I don’t care if OP wants to steal things. That’s part of the game. 
---
My point was around using a ‘RP excuse’ to justify the behavior. 
---
To address your point, just because there is an in-game function that addresses the behavior doesn’t make it no longer ‘bad behavior’. 
---
‘Bad behavior’ is anything that impedes another player. 
---
‘Good behavior’ is anything that supports another player. 
---
You seem to think that I’m trying to tell people what they can and cannot do. That’s not the case. I simply think using a the excuse of ‘I’m just role playing so I have to do this bad behavior’ is ridiculous and disingenuous.
---
Just do it because you want to. No need to ‘justify’ it.
---
If you want just one set, you're better off finding pieces or asking someone to build it. T60 plans are a very rare drop and you could easily spend months getting every one.
---
Huh, I wondered myself, but figured it had just been long enough I had forgotten how he sounded as the lines seemed largely the same. But maybe not now it turns out I'm not the only one to notice; if they have rerecorded his lines (a shame) he must have a larger role in future content that perhaps requires a voice actor willing to stay on for longer/in future. Interesting.
---
Either works. I'm willing to build it but if i can outright buy the set i'd be happy
---
Take the WS for XP, plans, and completing challenges, but hit the capture button and head for the green line.  As soon as the capture completes, step over the line.
---
Most mats can be obtained faster )and in larger quantity) simply by roaming that the workshops produce.
---
If you want to do a defend event, stay outside the green zone and pick off the NPCs with a sniper rifle.
---
If someone else shows up, they have to kill the NPCs before they take the workshop, and you get credit for the successful defend.
---
Since defend events are open to anyone,  I’ve been known to help with a defend just to complete one of the weekly “Complete X events” challenges, even though I have no interest in the workshop itself.
---
 Although I’m pretty sure I have scared more than one player doing that, as when I do that, I’m usually outside the zone, crouched/chameleon, and using a suppressed explosive sniper rifle.
---
How about a UV light that would highlight the blood (like in the CSI show) of those disappearing legendarilies.
---
I've always got a super mutant, out of sight, on the road below taking potshots at my fusion generator. It does take months to destroy it, but I've just been lazy. Need to build a wall in front of it, or put the scarecrow down in front.
---
Also, I have the disappearing turret syndrome. Doesn't matter if I scrap platforms or whatever it's sitting on, it just doesn't come back available anywhere. I'm down to just one well placed turret that seems to do most of the work anyway.
---
Not a bug, you can hit X to change views.
---
Yes. 
---
Next patch it will also be for pistols
---
Scrap combat armors
---
I’m a Vamps Heavy build and I live in my PA because outside of it I’m too squishy. Back in the day when the game was set up where your armor didn’t autoreset  every time you got in and out of P.A. using armor was heavy to carry and a PITA to re equip all the time so I just stay in my PA unless I need to get out. and  I know they fixed it but it’s just how I roll at this point on this char. It’s better now that I have the CSS so when I’m out I just stealth and have some protection.
---
Check both vendor bots in Grafton, that's where I found all of the BOS combat armor plans.
---
Settler gauntlet, not deathclaw gauntlet
---
I’m a bit of a plan collector but I’ve noticed only low level players tend to buy them unless high levels trying to complete plan collections. Therefore I’ve often done half price plans or now a days I do 5, 50, 100 cap plans. Depending on level of use, variations on levels the plan can be used at, and the amount of copies I have of it.
---
thanks for the heads-up, picked this up with my remaining atoms! now I need to see if I can get the log cabin bundle with my fallout 1st monthly atoms before it leaves the atomic shop
---
Pretty easy to make a .bat file to swap files back and forth for those who grew up in the DOS era like me.
---
I don't think that anyone who is out to grief other people "hides behind roleplay" other than using the raider icons. I don't think playing the intended gameplay mechanics is bad behavior or griefing.
---
So if I play Call of Duty and shoot a member of the other team while they are taking control point A, am I exhibiting bad behavior for impeding their progress?
---
If I see another player at a workshop and I shoot them to take their workshop and junk, am I exhibiting bad behavior for looking after my own interests?
---
If I unlock a water purifier to grab some water and incur a bounty so other players can kill me for the achievement progress, my caps and the junk I looted from the above example, am I still impeding their progress?
---
Go to watoga. There’s usually a power armor by the crashed vertibird in the middle. Has a chance of having t-45 or t-60 armor parts. There’s another building in watoga that has a vertibird with another power armor with the same chances of t-45 or t-60
---
Also you know the tunnel from the blue caravan mission? Riding shotgun? If you leave the tunnel and head east following the train tracks. There’s usually another set there.
---
Angry turtle was saying the same thing on his ranking of legendaries effects for the next patch.
---
They're asking about the actual BOS mods for combat armor, you can't learn those by scrapping. You need to just buy the plans from a vendor bot.
---
I saw one of my turrets attack Beckett once when he was the ally I was using. I heard it shooting, saw something in the distance it was shooting at, literally FLYING across the landscape. I ran over to see what it was, couldn't find anything... then Beckett comes walking up.
---
I only saw it doing it once, but I did see Beckett attacking my turrets a couple of times, I think after they shot at him.
---
Turrets that disappear are in your "stored" tab when in build mode. Stored turrets take up budget.
---
This feels like it'll actually work quite well in daily ops
---
I know it's free, but it's still just a red handmade. This season's selection is pretty dump imo, too much is either bright red or american flag. The metal wallpapers and greenhouse stuff is tight tho
---
Your argument completely dissolves in the face of untested cosmetics, unfixed bugs, and the Mountain Scout Mask. Putting in the minimum required effort to protect their profit margin doesn't make them deserving of a pat on the back.
---
The CMs are now using the line "I will raise this internally" which seems like a fitting metaphor for the fact that they are doing nothing but wiping their asses with our feedback forms and bug reports..
---
If you believe...
---
A lot better inside. Spawns are a lot faster.
---
How do we do that?
---
The crystalline barrel is for distance, if you want to get up close the standard works better.
---
Because the cryolator does minimal damage only a few prefixes are viable for a queen fight, namely TS and quad. If you can find one of those with better durability many would consider it a god roll.
---
Does the armor spawn at max level there? Might be worth the server hopping
---
I somehow doubt that eyebots are going to become a worrisome threat with one wasteland
---
It's not a matter of believing. It's understanding how it works. Why are you trying to defend Bethesda?
---
They said it would be alive forever so..
---
Low karma, 1yr old account...pat yourself on the back more bethesda
---
Not possible due to engine limitations, fallout 76 will always be plagued by bugs, just need to learn to play around them
---
Looks pretty useless, unless you only want to compare reload times.
---
No perks incorporated, so the damage output / DPS is always calculated wrong.
---
No, make it an actual viable weapon instead of another model flip skin for a worthless weapon
---
1st song....Going under ground?
---
Not as badly as some weapons, still a hefty loss but heavy guns have come out better than most. I still one shot most stuff with my bloodied gatling even without stabilized. Nerd rage and adrenaline should give you about double the damage increase you'd get using maxed out heavy gunner perks, so that's something to consider if they're even worth it.
---
Didn't Bunjie say something similar about Destiny? Then it got a sequel, and then they said the sequel would lose a shitton of content to "make room for more"?
---
Devs lie
---
Angry turtle showed that quad is about a 68% increase in dps if you have to reload while killing a mob. It yields similar results to junkies in terms of damage increase on the current patch. However, in patch 22 the effect of quad will remain multiplicative since its effect is similar to FFR in that it yields more rounds fired over time. The same can not be said for bloodied or junkies. So right now bloodied&gt;Junkies=quad vs sbq but that may not be the case on TUESDAY.
---
https://youtu.be/oLixdp4bTjA
---
Yeah the theme is USA vs Communist China basically. So color themes are the red and blue.
---
I do like the simple red viper handmade, it has that small chinese propaganda phrase and the red star on the stock.
---
The brick house pump-skin is nice too. I wonder if the silencer mod on that skin is more circular?
---
I'm happy to see this is a common reaction! This pretty much what I did. Except I didn't use up all the plans I didn't know,just the stuff I thought I would like to make for myself.
---
&gt; Literally NO ONE ever said "Man I can't believe they are just fixing bugs, ugh". 
---
Yeah you should have been here last year then. Nonstop complaining about "I'm bored, stop fixing things and give us wastelanders already"
---
Read this in context of the OP. Saying ‘I’m playing a cat burglar so I can steal from other player’s camps.’  That’s not just using a Raider icon. 
---
CoD is inherently designed as a competitive game. My comments are in context of ***THIS GAME***
---
Taking another person’s workshop and killing them *is* ‘bad behavior’ in the context of a primarily co-op game.  But it’s not griefing. There’s a difference. 
---
If you want to pick a lock so people can get caps and loot from you and work towards that Atom Challenge, then the *in-game* behavior is bad, but the *out-of-game/meta-game* motivation is good.
---
Player and character are separate entities. A character can do a ‘bad thing’ but that doesn’t mean the player is a ‘bad person’. 
---
Circling back to my point; Using a ‘Roleplay’ as the excuse for bad behavior is disingenuous.  I’ve pointed out ways the OP could still ‘play the role’ but not take other people’s property.
---
How are making ash piles being a jack off?  Please explain.
---
Its cheap for a reason.  Might be inventory clearing, might be player is near caps limit, so caps are not a big deal, or they don‘t know any better (and if they dont know, they may not care), might be simply trying to make things affordable to lower level players that usually don’t have that many caps to spare.
---
For example, I know any player than buys a serum from my machine can walk a couple minutes to the closest train station and make a hundred caps.
---
  I could make that profit myself, but A) I‘ve already made a profit from the sale, B)the serum might actually be useful (and affordable) to a low level player that doesn’t have it. C) I have more I can sell to the bots, if I actually need the caps. D) I hit max daily caps most days anyway, E) I generally have a running caps balance high enough to buy whatever I may want, 
---
so what said player does with that serum after they buy it; I don’t care.
---
OTOH, I do know what (some of my) legendaries are (theoretically) worth, but I can’t put it in my machine b/c my asking price + my usual caps balance would be more than enough to put me over max caps.
---
Knowing them it's would either be hard or they would fuck it up big time.
---
Same! Good on you friend!
---

XBL
---
I don't understand why some rare appeal is scrabble.
---
Inside white springs, by the piano. No turrets there but on hell of a fight.
---
Lmao that matches perfectly with the red communist PA. They released the f3 chinese assault rifle reskin with the green one, and nothing with the red one...makes you think
---
It means you've been hacked 
---
season ended. next one starts on tuesday
---
That’s what I had to do to get my level 50 armor pieces for my BOS t-60. So yes it’s possible.
---
yeah, use search
---
25 people ask this every     single     day
---
On pc you change your ini file. I did white and nograss
---
Shame they didn't use the green communist armour paints that were datamined a while back, they were less garish and a bit more versatile. Looking forward to see what they do with season 3.
---
looking forward to the 'farewell it's been fun but bethesda has roo-inned the game by nerfing my build' posts
---
If you press buy it will bring up a confirmation screen with the full item name
---
Sadly you can only build one.
---
Many times I've had 4 or 5 people up top all level 100+ and they always manage to get  3/4 killed while I collect ore.
---
I'm not going to lie, Angry turtle is extremely anecdotal .
---
Doing the math proves otherwise.
---
I wouldn't say Quad is multiplicative. Besides, you can easily pass up any DPS advantage quad offers by maxing out reload speed or equipping quick hands 3.
---
If you are running perkless, maybe quad is better in some instances. The Railway rifle and Tesla rifle are good examples. The quad tesla rifle is only better than the bloody/junky variants because the energy damage penetration formula is messed up and only accounts for base damage (meaning the damage boost from blood/junky isn't accounted for, and your damage gets reduced significantly more than its supposed to be, easily by over 80%)
---
This. I like crazy builds in crazy places. But not being able to place a prefab on something I meticulously built on a steep slope, cliff, tree, whatever...such a bummer.
---
Yeah the green Chinese assault rifle one seems to be more Premium, while the red one is just the basic handamde with red paint and the red star + propaganda phrase.
---
We've been asking for this since beta. Ive accepted that its just never going to happen.
---
Sucks how there isn't any challenges for atoms.
---
and those spots are never free :c
---
Green communist armor paints? What do they look like, got any pics?
---
Lag
---
The bright light is too bright, IMO.
---
The regular, not bright enough.
---
The best middle ground is the the Mr. Fuzzy mining helmet.  It's brighter than "Stock" - or rather has a wider throw... if that makes sense.
---
I also like the Mining hat (older style, not the helmet)
---
There’s going to be soooo much.
---
Im maxing in this order
---
1. Infiltrator - auto unlock stuff, I woulda killed to have this in the raids, otherwise to ease up on silo and random locked stuff
---
2. What rads - insane synergy with my solar armor for near god mode
---
3. Ammo factory - ammo reasons, gotta feed my rifle
---
4. Take one for the team - with what rads and solar I'm gonna be tanking a lot, so extra damage while trying to pull agro would be nice
---
5. Legendary str - gonna throw on higher blocker and move some other points around
---
6. Survival shortcut- food/drink just does not feel good in this game to me and is more of a nuisance than anything else, hot wheel and go
---
A utility that edits the .ini file isn't a mod, unless fallout76.exe is a mod, too (since that also edits your .ini file).
---
There are some who don't know, the are some who don't care. Coincidentally, how is this particular sg magic? I'm asking because I rolled one for my cowboy (cowgirl) character.
---
Guess I'll be spawn farming then. Appreciate the info
---
Ok, so this used to make me super angry. I was looking for a combat shotgun and the descriptions were superduperbuffedcombat... Is it a rifle, is it a shotgun? We may never know... BUT there is a workaround. If you click to purchase the item, there is a confirm screen that always shows the full name. If it's not the item you want, just cancel. Still a PITA, but at least it's usable.
---
Bugs.
---
Yeah, the -33% damage reduction should be listed in people’s status effects when you join a team. Not sure why it isn’t there.
---
You can have nothing equipped and still throw grenades...
---
Holy shit. Gonna play with that tonight. Thanks!
---
Oh man I might actually start picking locks again!
---
primarily the special points inteligence and luck, aside from that ammunition perk, if i have more points and space then, ill put some into either endurance or strength special
---
Wait the big moth man statue that’s in WV is available in the atom shop?
---
Right on, thx for all the replies.
---
Regular empath without strange in numbers and class freak is more of a selfless mutation and makes you take more damage. But you flip those numbers if you’re running those cards. So you do have to put special points towards that benefit at least.
---
I don't even have this challenge. Not completed, not on my list. The heck..
---
Ah. Thanks
---
Don't be so cynical. FO76 is one of the great survivor stories. We have Cyberpunk in November. We have Appalachia for now.
---
I am looking forward to Wastelands, there are no enemies in the wasteland right now.
---
Yes there are. Go finish your Combat/Social/World challenges. 
---
I’m guessing you have been away from the game for a few months, yes?
---
Yup. I found a 3* Quad Double Barrel Shot 3315 for a 1000 caps a few days ago and a 2* bloodied Tenderizer 40SS for 2000 a few days before that.
---
I’m gonna do it because I hate myself. I’m currently been doing magazines right now.
---
How about subtitle size/color??? Sometimes they’re just too damn hard to read.
---
That's not part of the bundle.
---
I sided with settlers can I still do it?
---
None of these mutations actually require teammate proximity. As long as you’re on a public team they’re fully active. With strange in numbers and class freak cards active, it’s a 25% damage resistance buff for you, and 33% buff for anyone else. Crazy good.
---
I agree with you there.
---
I've rename all my equipped armor like this "*SSLeftArm/Bl/VATS/PER"
---
The leading asterisk always sorts it to the top, so I'm less likely to accidentally deleted it,  and I can immediately see which piece is which.
---
I hear ya. So long as nothing breaks vendors or player stash, I’ll be content.
---
I had a furious ffr gatling plasma. Even with stabilized, I found it difficult to hit the same spot consistently, to trigger the furious effect. I might not be doing it right, but I've never had that problem with a gatling laser.
---
Hahahahahahaha 😂
---
The overwhelming majority of my interactions are positive.  I've met maybe a total of three griefers and they lost interest pretty quickly since I'm full pacifist.  The only place that you might get forced into PVP is in a workshop so just keep that in mind.  Otherwise, with pacifist on the game plays pretty much like a private server but with some extra NPCs that are played by real people.  I've been gifted ingredients ammo and weapons by people and I have been trying to pay it forward now that I'm a higher level.  You can only cash in so many legendaries per day so I generally just drop them at people's camps if I'm over the limit.  there's almost always a drop bag at the door to my camp containing the types of ammo I don't use even though I have the converter.  you will occasionally see some outrageous prices and player vendors but most of the time you can get some cool stuff for pretty cheap. I too was skeptical of playing an MMO as I typically don't like them.  This game is turned out to be much closer to other fallout games with the occasional helpful person.
---
No it is actually Microsoft's fault on this one. People similar issues with the NA release of Phantasy Star Online 2 through the Microsoft store. For some reason the Windows store likes screwing with read and write permissions of games installed outside of the C drive.
---
I’m excited for a lot of things. Legendary Perks. New Season. One Wasteland. Adapting to the new damage modifiers balance (which should take all of five seconds).
---
But most of all?  What I’m looking forward to the most?
---
The end of all the **‘Where did all the Daily and Weekly Challenges go?’** posts in this subreddit.
---
Oh my God. That’s why the Whitesprings robots often turn hostile towards me for no reason.
---
no, it's a .ini tweak.
---
the mod is just a tweak with extra steps.
---
Oh this would be so cool. I mean there would only be a max of 4 so why not! Maybe there will need to be some limitations on inventory access, otherwise I can see it as a dupers paradise.
---
I got the shotgun he mentioned, it's got bash damage as a legendary effect. I'm not 100% sure of how it works but angry turtle has a video explaining it I do believe.
---
I literally had to leave like 6 legendaries on the floor of the rusty pick because my stash was full, hit the daily sell limit, and I was 200 over encumbered. Hope someone picked through them lol.
---
Only half of that. Somewhere around 1 1/2 moths ago. Stopped playing because of how grindy the challenges were.
---
SPECIALs
---
Because I know the underlying problem, and that is on MS not Beth.
---
You wouldn't blame it on your dog if your car ran out of gas, would you?
---
No you have to do it before siding but you can still get rep for both sides. There's the raider dailies, Davenport, and black eye at Ohio river adventures
---
I'm pretty sure you got pushed on to some board traps and then your game glitched out possibly because the way the trap camp was built.
---
Someone in the modding community will probably do all the heavy lifting, like usual.
---
I’ll be on in about 15 minutes. I think I can craft some of the t-60 pieces. Not sure. I’ll message you if I have them.
---
Here are my favorite damage resistance cards as a bloody build in order of importance to me:
---
Serendipity,
---
Dodgy (with action boy and rejuvenated feeding it AP),
---
Blocker,
---
Ricochet, 
---
Barbarian, 
---
Secret Service Torso Dense Mod (or 3 star fireproof card)
---
Then you probably should have noticed the ‘Legendary Run’ and that your Daily and Weekly Challenges have been awarding SCORE instead of Atoms.  Since June 30th.
---
Any way I can reverse it? Or what if I increase my rep?
---
I use vanguard outside of pa... I run outside, because I use a lot of fusion cores in my weapons, and even with power user and batteries included (plus 2 pieces of weapon weight reduction armor), I am often weighed down and burning through cores.
---
Gauss rifle isn't commando though. It's rifleman. Riflemen are single shot, semi auto while commando is fully automatic. The latter almost always does more dps.
---
Edit: ah I see you did mean to go with non auto. I guess try getting a quad gauss rifle. Those 5-6 rounds go quick, vats doesn't always work and the reload time is long!
---
If you’re on ps4 I’d be happy to lace you up with some gear
---
Yaaasss!
---
No, it's just a rotating assortment of aid items.
---
from what i have read a lot of people will be getting at least half of their slots with nothing but special boosting legendary perks. i know i am, still debating about if i want 3 or 4 of my legendary cards to be special related. either P.E.A (3) or P.E.C.A (4)
---
Yeh that's true, I don't expect anything to come of it just yet but I don't see any problem with it... Atm. Possibilities are endless but also could be dangerous.
---
Mine has ffr as secondary.
---
It's a struggle we all feel 
---
I've had people dump 10+ legendaries for me as 'gifts' and it's just like " :/ I cant pick these up but thanks"
---
The responder vendor in grafton (not at the train station) should have them.

With [all bloodied stealth commando perks incorporated](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html?left=R_W-TheFixer_L-50_ModReceiver-PowerfulAutomatic_ModMagazine-Perforating_ModMuzzle-Suppressor_Prefix-Bloodied_Major-FFR_Sneak_Team_PHP-19_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-0_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_TankAP-36_Covert-50_Nerd-20_Strange_Adrenal_Other-0_Add&amp;right=R_W-TheFixer_L-50_ModReceiver-PowerfulAutomatic_ModMagazine-Perforating_ModMuzzle-Suppressor_Major-FFR_Sneak_Team_PHP-19_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-0_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_TankAP-36_Covert-50_Nerd-20_Strange_Adrenal_Other-0_Add), the quad pulls ahead again (performance against armor ends up being better) even with speed demon. I'm getting a 14% increase. This assumes a perforating mag. At that damage armor penetration starts to not matter so much, so swift will probably be best. If anyone knows how a swift mag stacks with speed demon I'll add it to the spreadsheet.
---
I feel stupid cause it was the first thing i bought when i finally had enough bullion and it doesnt even look good on anything else. So now i gotta save up more bullion to get the set. :(
---
How many days has it been now, more than a month? Is there any progress with this?
---
Yeah, I said that wrong. Although, I can take a kick to the face from Earle and barely notice it.
---
I usually only run stealth suit at night to pair it with that perk card that gives you night vision between 6pm and 6am.
---
There’s one right now where this guy is whining about missing Daily &amp; Weekly Challenges and no ‘Free Atoms’. At first I thought maybe he just hasn’t played in a few months, but he said it’s only been about six weeks. Which would have been right in the middle of the Season. 
---
How do you play for half the season and not notice the Dailies &amp; Weeklies aren’t giving you Atoms anymore?
---
I appreaciate the offer, but I just managed to get a set for 6k :)
---
Xbox but thanks for the offer
---
Most I don’t even know what they are so if there’s anything decent in the pile I hope someone got it lol
---
Luck &gt; Int are my first priorities but I'm not sure what to do after that.
---
I just snagged one from a player vendor for 5k caps. PM me your GT if you want to buy it.
---
Does a given enemy have its damage resistance drop as you damage it?
---
if you wanna pre-plan a bit, they updated Nukes&amp;Dragons for the legendary perks as they currently exist on the PTS. [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
No wonder Bethesda is selling communist bundles. Sorry op hope it gets sorted out soon that’s my nightmare right there !
---
Not unless you roll a new character. You really just miss a few items and it would have boosted your rep with the raiders
---
Yeah, tough given it costs 100 perk points to rank up...still not sure, but I'm leaning towards 5 agi boost to add lvl 5 adrenalin.
---
Who plays fallout ps4?
---
Bro I know of the legendary run challenges, I'm like lvl 50 still in the battlepass... Was just saying how it sucks that they don't reward you atoms for the weekly and Daily challenges anymore, since most of the other challenges, like the world challenges and etc, are bugged for me atm, and how most of mine are complete.
---
I feel the same! It's my favourite pistol even if it not that powerful :)
---
I see. Lets wait until the calculator has changed over from multiplicative to additive calculation, shall we? I see no gain in arguing about this for the last 3 days the claculator might have been accurate .)
---
Fallout 4 is by far the better RPG but 76 is a pretty decent RPG for being an online game/MMO.
---
I’m on Xbox
---
Next time you bring up your Pip Boy, press the button/key that changes the camera's view. You should now see the solid Pip Boy again.
---
On Xbox, this is the "Back" button, and on PC it is the "V" key. On PS4 I am not sure, but believe you just tap the touch pad once.
---
Yeah the legendary run really turned the game into a daily chore for me.  I'm going to play some other games for a while and skip the next season.
---
No kidding! With information readily available online
---
, I’ figured it was common knowledge.
---
That and when you turn on the pipboy light your controller light changes to green.
---
Mama dolches bunker
---
Whole point of this post is just me wondering why my weekly and dailies are missing. Didn't know anything about the 2nd season, so I was just confused.
---
If you are on PC you can add me. OvetsSquatch
---
It all hinges on is the game profitable and gaming as a service. I definitely don’t worry about a sequel since Bethesda only really makes a new one in a series once every ten years or so. This is like the fallout new Vegas generation wise. Skyrim was immensely popular but still hasn’t had a sequel for ten years.
---
 Look at Grand Theft Auto, Minecraft. Terraria ESO  NoMan Skyetc. Or mobiles like clash of clans We reached a point where it’s better to add on to an existing game then start a new one.
---
A bloodied plasma rifle with auto rifle is more than just viable, but very fun.
---
You can do it on PC, I just play with an Xbox controller and I can manually switch
---
You can have fun by establishing yourself as a helpful resource for other players 
---
You can make a nice camp.
---
You can make sales a lot. You can visit other people's camps and buy what you don't know.
---
None of these suggestions are an argument to play more. But you will be a part of a community that moans and whines about the season pass, and then completes it with weeks to spare.
---
You then complain about scrip limits and the like, even though you just trade them in with mummy for useless guns....and then the cycle continues. 
---
The bit about becoming an established player is the most fun bit.
---
I like how I'm getting downvoted despite agreeing with OP and liking their post
---
I was just making a joke ;-;
---
That’s...a lot. But at least you got it :)
---
Eh, caps dont really hold any value for me. I traded a tesla rifle for 10k presents a while back and money hasnt been a concern since
---
White springs golf course is prime location for flat land🤫🤫🤫
---
I recommend using the ‘search’ function in the future. This is a very common question that has been answered dozens of times.
---
i am gonna assume and they work like items you pick up in the world and containers. You need to pick up/loot x amount of items for things to respawn.
---
Nvm I'm on ps4
---
No I run heavy guns, te downside still doesnt out weight the up for me, weight reductions and other stats on my armour just aren't worth losing
---
Cant die with a vampires minigun
---
Be the robot FISTO. Fist them soon.
---
Yes but it also changes everyone else's Pip-Boy color, and it's only client side so nobody else will see the color change from their perspective.
---
Its not time related.  They will refresh after you pick up approx. 180 other items.  Server hopping doesnt help either.  There is a house in summersville, the one to the right when you fast travel, that has a lot of burnt books to pick up to speed up the refresh.
---
Well, you can come out ahead ammo-wise as long as you are efficient, which makes it beneficial to have a team that spreads the burden of killing enemies.  Daily Ops can be quite difficult when all of the enemies focus on *you* because it's a relentless, non-stop flow of them.
---
I like it.  I am going to need more Responder outfits =)
---
Tried too, but couldn't find anything.
---
I’m getting one point in infiltrator because I don’t mind the mini game, I just hate switching out the perks. After that? Not to sure. My wife is maxing ammo factory and even after that, I do not have ammo issues at all, so I guess I can experiment with the silly niche perks. I like the idea of the that explosive range perk, so I might pick that up!
---
Hey I would like the plan.  I have done the encriptid event several times to no luck.  Is that where you get it from?
---
That's insane, I mean reading these comments Im convinced no one should even be complaining about bugs if all they want is content. It's one or the other with this community and that honestly upsets me a bit.
---
Imagine bringing it into a hotel room, though. Disgusting.
---
psn sinistrmark
---
I do one run and hope one or two will join for max rewards
---
I want that damn RAD Barrel finally
---
I’ll take a plan Ik a guy who needs one my psn is Thatonedumdum-
---
Edit: but idk when I’ll be on it’ll probably be a while
---
If you run heavies out of power armour you're kinda st00pid no offence. Heavy weapons build in excavator armour with cali shocks will have just under 500 carry capacity and the bonus accuracy+armour penentration. How is that a carry weight conpromise?
---
??? one time out of the last month have I loaded into a camp can not be placed and my area is flat as flat can be. I also never had a problem when I had my gas station style set up south of whitesprings. Never once had someone ever have my 100% flat spot with wild animal spawns (chickens.foxes,squirrels) in northern savage divide.    
---
Seriously think outside of whitesprings. north of New Gad area fits 4 camps though the it is common now for the one with the resource and water to be taken. When I was using it for a month I had no issue but a lot of people have moved to that area.   
---
I keep a camp location for a month I change up my camp every two weeks since it is something I find fun. Be it a roadside hotel, a gas station, a playground, a despaired campsite, an actual real looking cliff home, mire underground tunnel homes.   
---
Point is I have done a lot of exploring and have sites lined up for each character and different themes. Those flat spots exist in plentiful amounts they just might not be in high traffic areas or lack a resource you want.   
---
Final piece of advice if wanting flat land lot at the bog there is so so so many areas. On of my favorites is by bog town, I have a small inn just outside of it has some trenches but that gets filled in and hidden with foundations so no problem.
---
But to throw the grenades you need them equipped?
---
Mmmm hadnt tbought of that.
---
Suppressor gets rid of aoe effect for gauss

Yes that’s where you get it from. Will you be online tomorrow by any chance?
---
Nah. Defending OP on this, i have everything from gamepass installed on a different drive, even PSO2. PSO2 never gave me issues either. Works fine. FO76 is the only game that has this problem.
---
ammo factory.  As a heavy gun user I throw a lot of lead down range.  It will be a big quality of game improvement for me.
---
Your own advice is the correct one. Hang around in areas you're comfortable dealing with, do side quests &amp; events in the area &amp; explore those areas in depth because sometimes you'll find a side or daily quest.
---
 I’ll be on tomorrow
---
Now that it’s not being nuked every other minute it seems quite nice. Flat land, robot security, decent foot traffic for your vendors.
---
This was with the "additive buffs" option toggled on the damage calculator (it's down at the bottom), though the site says that might still be wonky. With multiplicative I think bloodied wins, but that only applies for a few more days so I didn't bother calculating it.
---
Cranberry bog does have a lot of flat areas, just the neighbors kinda blow.
---
That’s fine I should be too
---
Power Armor. Lack of regard for the well-being of others. Sounds like BoS to me!
---
Yes. Thanks.  I am free all day and night today and just a couple Drs. appointments tomorrow am but free the rest of the day and night.
---
I don't think so but I'm only lvl 67 so I don't know alot
---
All five of my characters have a magic shotgun so I usually just sell additional ones for about an additional 1500 caps on the base price, those things’re heavy and take up a lot of stash! 😅
---
What do you mean ? You mean that it may not be the perfect environment for a low lvl character ?
---
In that case...for high lvl characters (lvl50+) ? It has to be...
---
Daily Ops is fun and repeatable, you can do one and jump right back into another session. The XP gain is lowered like for the robots in the silo. Your gear's condition also deteriorates more slowly too.
---
getting your account hacked is a real thing, dont assume he got phished or keylogged (especially with the hubris you are using in saying you know how it really happened)
---
people need to make sure they change their account name from something BESIDES their account login because it's also common for people to run dictionary attacks against the userIDs that the hackers see while in-game.
---
Maybe BOS will make a buildable sonic deterrent?
---
I rolled basically three pieces of unrelenting to include chest right arm and left leg. Then right leg is cloaking and left arm is live saver. I went through a bunch of modules for this, for the other perks I cannot remember off hand. 
---
I'm going off just the basic damage and energy resistance. I'm getting my lunch handed to me now by  couple of mole rats and low level ghouls. It's so bad that I find my power armor is now more dependable in regular fights than this armor that I grinded for. This just irks me.
---
Makes sense , helluva lot better than selling to a vendor bot that's for sure!
---
I read about that but i think its only meant for federal businesses and the military that aren't supposed to use it
---
Same, in my 150 hours playing, only one time someone took my workshop, and it was the one with 3 junk piles, ive being claiming the ammo factory (unowned) and no one ever took it from me :v
---
I want my amber colors back so i can pretend im playing nv again
---
It sounds like you need to make friends (who aren't from the Netherlands) to play with &amp; help out.
---
Ask around here &amp; see if you have any luck.
---
I’m 117 and i don’t know lol
---
I went for a wander in the north east of the map this morning. Plenty it spots and that is just one small area. Downvotes from bad builders. Keep em comin
---
Yeah but different players have different wants and needs. I would also be doing a lot more damage if I didnt have like 7 weight reduction perks equipped. MI is a good Legendary Perk, at least in concept, since it offers nice QoL for those of us who hold QoL in high regard, and can be completely ignored by people who would rather have the damage or can menu faster.
---
I’ll reserve one of the plans for you, I only ask you DM me tomorrow whenever you’re online
---
ok thanks
---
Been there, looked in that, I read that a long time ago, looked, nothing in stored, nothing. I either have a severe case of the bug, or it doesn't always apply. Yea I know they are taking up budget. I'm at the point where I'm about to scrap and totally redesign my camp anyway, so I'm tired of trying to figure out what's happening. I've even tried "repair all structures" just in case, nothing.
---
Oh are you serious !? There's the catch ok.
---
The gameplay in this video, seemed to show a pretty decent gain of xp tho. But yeah some xp gains were suspicious too.
---
Thank you.
---
I'm more referring to allowing players to sell it in bulk at camp vendors
---
Planning?
---
She was shooting it out with one of my turrets today for no reason. Both were showing as friendly and they both remained at full health. 
---
I just kinda did my thing while they were going at it for 15 mins before I left.
---
go off bro
---
that's exactly what i mean.  my wording wasnt the best admittedly but yeah i think it would be a great idea
---
They have rights to being crushed in the mine. Like you cannibals should be put down too.
---
Yeah, it's basically the Power Fist but craftable with modules. And also IMO uglier until you shock mod it.
---
I mean, they couldve just given the Power Fist a module variant instead since they really are basically the same weapon, but the comment was about not seeing then and why *wouldnt* you see that?
---
My recommendation is to play around for a while and get a feel for the changes under the new damage system and for the new daily ops before jumping into the legendary perks. They are costly to upgrade, and I'm afraid a lot of people will be kicking themselves after a week in the new system

Battlecoat on my main with Mechanist on my Ally.
---
They are “better” graphics but the bugs just ruin it
---
You need to reinstall the game on your OS drive.
---
Good advice 👍
---
That's always a safe troubleshooting step and I, too, would recommend re-downloading it on a console.
---
But that said crashes have been extremely common since the last update two or three weeks ago; on PC I have been crashing 2-5 times a day. It feels like the game is missing a critical TDR and instead of letting the game catch up to the frames lost it just freezes and crashes. As always your mileage may vary.
---
Most excited for season 2 because I only started playing in the dying stages of season 1 and I'm looking forward to fully taking part, yay :D
---
Lacklustre? The first year was an absolute disaster that few games have ever experience.
---
We're not all sycophants praising Bethesda up on high all the time. When it's praiseworthy ie just after Wastelanders, they get praise. Every other time it's a critique or request for shortcomings from the game, which are a multitude.
---
What else could you expect?
---
English please :)
---
I had a similar experience when I made my alt, even though I was wearing the Season 1 end rewards to try to flag that I wasn't new lmao
---
Are you still playing? :) I'll gladly come and pay you a visit! I'm level 49 but still very new to the game, but if you'd rather it go to a lower level that's fine :)
---
i never said anything about forcing a price i simply requested the ability to instead of selling at a set price for individual rounds to have the ability to sell maybe 10 rounds for one price that you can make however ridiculous you want.  for example say you have 1k rounds of 10mm ammo.  right now the lowest you can sell it for is 1c per round when you should be able to sell let's say 25 rounds in a package for a set price like say 10 caps.  obviously different ammo types have different values but right now you can only sell the individual rounds for a set price
---
Join up!
---
stupidest quest ever. im having the same issue with nothing counted 9/13/20
---
I honestly believe that some players don't even realize that taking a workshop is an open invite for pvp. I didn't know it until after about a dozen times since I would just take the workshop and ignore the text window that popped up. I made a post here once complaining about a griefing experience I had at a workshop (I still believe it was griefing and it's hard to justify as I don't have clips or anything) but after reading through dozens of responses I got I realized that if I want to avoid pvp, just don't take workshops in public servers...and turn on pacifist mode xD
---
For the record I never had an issue before that. Other players would stop by my workshops, use the crafting benches or help defend if there was an attack and move on. It was just that one time that I had an issue.
---
Yeah it's just *mod*ifying the game
---
Xbox, same
---
It’s a game changer for sure! It’s oddly satisfying seeing your game piece move forward on the board!
---
Punching, so it’s Iron Fist you need.
---
idk about that.  
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html?
---
this was a quick check and when you change from multiply to add the damage stays the same.  This site takes in account for patch 22 multiply to add change.
---
It would be cool if the color change affected pipboy flashlight color as well. Bunch of colorful folk running around in the dark doing an event.
---
I think it's yes because I saw it on another post
---
There are lots of flat areas in the north west as well, Along with the dry lake bed around new Gad. Follow almost any highway long enough and you’ll find a flat enough area to build in. Most just aren’t ideal, no access to resource nodes, no access to water, too many enemies, no view.
---
It seems when an enemy is aware of a presence (like your teammates) but you are hidden or in caution the sneak bonus doesn't happen, unless all of you are hidden.
---
The answer is no. I've done enough testing to know that as soon as someone enters [Danger] Sneak Multiplier stops working
---
Some people are lucky, some aren't. Besides, first twenty posts have nothing in common with workshop complains... your post is a little bit exaggerating.
---
Ooo first I’ve seen of that! Pretty 😍
---
Except it's not... unless you consider setting the resolution in-game "*mod*ifying" the game because it changes the .ini file.
---
At best, it's *mod*ifying the game settings, which... ok. That's a strangely broad definition of "mod"
---
If Bethesda truly believes this game to be a MMORPG then they absolutely have to add in a proper text chat feature similar to what those games use.
---
You can do the ops as many times as you want. But you will get the main reward once for each rank. So if you complete lowest one you can still try to get higher.
---
On a sidenote, it's very easy to get highest rank on 4 man team. And relatively easy for experienced player to get it while soloing.
---
Is the headlight red? I’ll only go tactical red!
---
How about checking real data?
---
Yes it's horrible. If you start a new character you will be surprised how fluent this game runs.
---
Ok thanks
---
Jack o'lantern suit. I haven't gotten too hardcore into collecting or buying outfits.
---
Ammo Factory, Follow Through, Funky Duds (poison), Sizzling Style (fire), SPECIALS in agility and luck because there are so many good cards in those categories that I'd love to equip
---
Did you get all the technical data paints?
---
iron fist only has 1 card, if you want more punching power you would also need Twisted Muscles and Talons Mutations
---
Wait so even if you don’t verify the new email address the password still gets sent to the new one? I am assuming that is not working as intended and is a huge security issue.
---
Ah yes german
---
Wasn’t aware. I’ve only been playing for about two months, so still fairly new to this sub.
---
^^
---
If I enter the event and it is just me, I will just farm XP and loot. If another person or more shows up and they are relatively high damage build, I will run all 4 hallways and then just farm XP and finish the event with them hoping they also run. I go into the event doing my part and then joining the crowd lol
---
Ugh, this is still my #1 most hated feature of PS4 controllers. I can't play games in the dark because it always glares off my screen 😭
---
😄😄😄
---
Would be so much better. Heck even Forza had this for years, even runescape has it lol
---
If you plan to use prebuilt structures try planning the build placement around the prefab
---
Fuck. That has the lights in it I've been wanting!!
---
I'm looking forward to having new parts of the map to go to, to farm xp etc.
---
And having higher level enemies and more of a fight.
---
I use heavy weapons and only wear PA at Scorched Earth and ACP.  I prefer good armor much more (using unyielding SS).
---
Serendipity is key. Having Sentitinel/Cavalier armor pieces can help as well. 
---
There’s a ton of write ups already in this sub. Try the search function and see what you get.
---
Turn the brightness down on it, mines set to low for the same reason
---
Gary?
---
Camp allies are part of the problem. Literally watched the Wanderer leave her guitar, open the nearest door, then walk back to her guitar.
---
Wish doors were on a timer to close automatically after so long.
---
[I got tired of all that bullshit and I figured out a solution, since concrete foundations are invulnerable.](https://i.imgur.com/heIk016.png)
---
with PA you're reasonably tanky. other than that, sneak.
---
you're gonna be really vulnerable outside those two options unless you have some esoteric build.
---
Do you have the adrenal reaction mutation? As far as necessary bloodied perks I’d say nerd rage, serendipity, dodgy are what you’re missing from your previous build. And yes get a set of unyeilding. Sneak perks help with damage and not dying as well.
---
Now that's a beast mode gun right there. I rolled a couple of passable Railway Rifles and a Junkie's Gauntlet so far. Can't say I've been blessed with anything as good as this beast.
---
Try the cliffs across the road from Whitespring. Plenty of good flat areas, elevated enough to avoid enemy spawns, and less popular now since WS doesn't get nuked very often.
---
How about the dried lake bottom?? Water and a few extractor spots.
---
But you only get 6 legendary points to pick from...I'm not likely to go with ammo factory since ammo will be a lot cheaper after this patch due to this perk.
---
This. Catches so many people out. 
---
The overseers house also has a decent amount of items to pick up
---
I stopped using them entirely. Had them at my camp built into the power tower below Camp Mclintock before Wastelanders fell and they would constantly snipe some innocent group of supermutants just walking along the road, attracting them up into my camp to cause trouble. Took them out and never had another issue with mobs trashing the camp for the next 6 months I was in that spot.
---
what are they listed under ?
---
thats their secret, they are all always dead
---
you do know you can start it yourself yeah?
---
Serendipity haha

1 Infiltrator - too good to pass up

2 Survival Shortcut - heals diseases plus max food and water??? Yes please
---
3 Far Flung Fireworks - add’l damage 
---
4 Take One For The Team - add’l damage in the new team based environment 
---
5 Luck - I currently have 8 points, an extra 5 will go a long way
---
6 What Rads/Ammo - I cant see the Ammo Factory as an active perk. Makes sense to max it, but may not use it much as I already have loads of ammo
---
Ahh man I hope not. I downloaded the game when I had fast WiFi but I moved since then and my internet suuucks now. Like 3mbps suck. Will take me three or four days probably!
---
Yeah, they're gone until Season 2 kicks off.
---
What do you mean?  This webstie allows you to put in your guns stats and then switch the damage buff from multiply to add.  What if he is not a bloodied build?  What if he doesnt have a BE legacy energy weapon?
---
Yeah, I've been the only one doing them. And it'd be way easier if others did them too
---
Nope, I am sitting there already. :D
---
I regularly have to reconnect one or even two times to get a server where that spot is not taken already. So I might not be the only one.
---
you can't get 3\* from 1-2\*
---
(unless this has been changed)
---
EDIT: I'm gonna leave my idiocy here for the world to see. I'm gonna own that shit.
---
Damn feelsbadman
---
listen to this.. say a player is at the beginning peaceful towards you at YOUR workshop.. that player has the right to change his mind and turn on you at any time.. and try to hijack it. it is  his perogative to play however he feels at that time.. he could chose to help you or harm you at any moment and people cant come to grips with that.. even though most people just want to complete an event etc.. if someone out of the blue wants to takeover your workshop and you cry about it you are the one in the wrong because you should know to protect your property..
---
It's way easier for you to buy the plan for fixer from other players. You can usually get it anywhere between 5000-10000 caps (even lower sometimes), which is quite easy to save up even for newer player.
---
I've never had to pay that much.  
---
My main char is a stealth sniper. Luckily got Marsupial at random. I know it has Herbalist, Bird Bones, Eagle Eyes, Egg Head, and Healing Factor. Those I got from a player vendor and between 300-500 caps each.  
---
Many players like me are causal players and in no way rich. If people want to take the time to make them, then they have to be reasonably priced.
---
not to hand no, but they were datamined maybe 6+ months ago? Pretty sure it was pre-wastelanders. But they were khaki green with a red star on the arms, there's paints for the same selection u get in the seasons so robot, metal, scout etc.
---
There's a fair few unreleased armour skins, even remember seeing black and red blood eagle Trapper paints a while back.
---
If you give me 5 I can get you. Psn is clambacon
---
wait until after ACP or scorched earth or server hop and look for high pop servers with higher levels.
---
I'm not on now will be later on tonight tho..
---
1700 GMT
---
5 SPECIALS and Follow Through most likely.  
---
   
---
Funky Duds seems not too bad, but most PVE poison is not a big deal with a piece of poison resist armor.   
---
Master Infiltrator is cool, but I'd rather get the extra SPECIAL points and swap perk cards when needed.
---
Might just be a feature, it is a Bethesda game after all.
---
The website simply uses wrong data, at least not the same as we get on pts which are the only official infos we have.
---
It doesn't matter if bloodied, explosive or anything different. I dont assume someone will use weapons without any legendary effect while thinking about damage at all. Every effect is affected. Every gun is affected. Every effect is affected. But all in a different way and unequally.
---
Yes, that’s exactly what he said. What was the point of your comment
---
Okay, I'll try that
---
He means if a 3* can drop a 1* then let 1* drop drop 3*
---
I can make you some decent low level armor sometime. It'll give you some extra durability till you get good equipment. 
---
I won't be on today but certainly in the coming week.
---
Yeah they can take it if they want. Just saying nobody has tried it in 6 month's. So not worth crying about.
---
Im sry mate. I think i gonna change it to english soon.
---
I've never found anyone selling the plans though. I'd totally buy it if I found them.
---
Unyielding armor, that jumpy serum, and magic or OP weapons that pack a punch.
---
Stealth.
---
You're on the right track, but I will say put off the Wayward quests until you're level 50. It gives you a bona fide endgame item, and if you're below level 50 it will be too.
---
Also, ignore it if anybody gives you hate purely for using melee. There's not a huge amount of people that do, but as long as you're not oneshotting legendaries in events people go to primarily because of legendaries(like Uranium Fever or AWOL Armaments) their whining is pointless and not worth responding to. You may want to keep a weaker backup weapon handy to avoid oneshotting legendaries.
---
No problem shoot me an add and message when you need it
---
Yes, but that wasn’t the point of the post!
---
The point was after 1400 hours, I finally got a god roll for one of my characters.. 48 hours before the biggest nerf.
---
“Bad“ experience as as lower level player, even if it is a rite of passage, can leave lasting impressions (and behaviors).
---
Having a high level player PvP you for a workshop, even though its a game mechanic, then take all your stuff can be traumatic.   
---
  More so if said player then taunts, griefs, teabags you body, whatever.
---
Happened to me at sub lvl 20, pre pacifist days.  Group of high levels obliterated me, took my stuff, then proceeded to chase me across the map, repeatedly killing me, making multiple very impolite statements while doing so, until I finally logged off. 
---
  Well over 200 levels later, I still don’t care for PvP, and I no longer stick around after I take a workshop.  I take the workshop for plans, XP, and challenges, but if I defend it against NPCs, I do so with a sniper rifle from outside the zone, and I gather mats elsewhere.
---
I personally gain nothing but the rules are here for a very good reason. You don't need to promote the use of exploits, cheats, hacks, glitches etc in here. The community is struggling enough with them already. Even if you say you aren't, you will still cause newer players to get interrested in such things when "educating" (hah!) people about these sort of items.
---
Light and great for stealth builds.
---
I appreciates you!
---
Unyielding ss chest and legs bolstering ss arms.  Serendipity and nerd rage.  And a bloodied shotty oh and blocker easy to be alive when everything is dead
---
it's supposed to be the best sneak armor in the game, but the shadowed portion of the shrouded mod is currently broken. speed demon also caps movement speed already, and the impact of armor weight on your ability to sneak is pretty minimal anyway. if any.
---
so yeah, it's pointless in its current form. bolt rifles and revolver at least can double dip.
---
Thanks for the advice.
---
Put a tattered on my ally.....figured it was worth the risk.
---
Which category for your specials?
---
I cant decide between agi/int.
---
People post the same thing everyday. Give us this, bitch about that, help with this...shouldn’t be anything new really.
---
It is on the lowest setting 😭
---
Thanks tho.
---
I lost faith in the event few weeks back when I saw a level 200 trying to facetank the ISS while it was cloaked. 
---
the level 200 died at least 7 times. and after respawning he would run straight to the ISS face to try to kill it again. 
---
I sat on the top of the satellite dish and watched, speechless.
---
They are mutations. Often high level players sell them at their camps. Starched Genes is a perk card that stops you losing your mutations after you get them. So you might want that one. In luck I think.
---
Don't think it's ash piles in general, just the Tesla. Think maybe it leaves bugged invisible ash piles. That breaks the fps completely when you look at it, if you look away it returns to normal. If you fast travel away and return the bug is gone.
---
Thanks but I think I’m ok going to try to fend for myself
---
Oh people would sneak up on me all the time when I was doing the stupid score build stuff challenges and shoot me in the back. I'd just claim a different one though not a big deal, but can be pretty annoying if it keeps happening.
---
Is there no real way to go for a rifle build without sneak? Everyone I see using rifles does for sneak perks, but I'm not a fan of sneaking around in Fallout.
---
I mean, once you shoot one enemy wont you loose your sneak bonus?
---
Search peoples vendors, realm hop, rinse/repeat.. I saw several today when i was looking for plans i don't have yet. They are there :)
---
Is it a bug that the damage numbers still show as the sneak damage then? I've done ACP multiple times where I'm in [caution] but it still says I'm getting sneak hits on my screen and my damage numbers are increased to match. Now I'm just confused.
---
Yes man im on discord add me ConfusionTX #6374
---
Also does the friend request shows up in the launcher or in-game? Sorry for the confusion lol 😅
---
It's the best armour for stealth.
---
I have only stuck around after claiming one a handful of times.    
---
I have only taken them for plans and supplies. I leave and go about things as usual. I play solo even when I get into a group for the bonuses.    
---
I have never been killed for a workshop. In fact, someone showed up and I emoted to them in a way they knew they could have it. Regardless of 'game mechanic that gives people anxiety' it's a post apocalyptic world.    
---
To those upset about this: If you expect everyone to play nice and fair in-game or the real world you're not going to last long.
---
Thanks for the advice but I rushed through the wayward quests as I thought they were the first you were meant to complete :(
---
I honestly already gave up on the sale and just rolled for the little daily scrip i could get. I wouldnt mind getting some railways as well. I get em rly rarely. They seem to have some crazy vats range. A BE or B33 would be grand.
---
I run a Commando build, so P/A/L for sure, probably Intelligence not for the perks but because it's free XP.
---
I've heard that the Charisma Legendary is bugged and doesn't allow you to share more points, so I'll probably take points I free up and put them in Charisma directly to get myself to 9 base.
---
Given that the last card will go to Endurance or Strength, probably Endurance.  Strength only tempts me because carry weight is a constant pain in the ass, and 5 Strength gets you a lot of carry weight, and the option for more carry weight perks.
---
I mean the level thing won’t matter with one wasteland, but could settle near the other high school or just run WT a lot for the laser rifles from mutants for plastic (w/ scrapper equipped).
---
Idk, these things are mostly personal preference and no one can really tell you where to setup shop.
---
Yeah but...it can happen. Nobody loses too much. Ok I had a sweaty moment when I took the ammunition factory...turned out the fellas helped me. I just don't think it is an issue.
---
Is there an easy way to find your server? :) Sorry, still a lot to learn! xD
---
Because if you do not have friends online at the same time there is little hope that the others playing will know what to do and actually help. Why potentially waste 2000 caps to just be frustrated.
---
It's a bit screwy, forbidden knowledge is intended to be hit multiple times, unlimited as long as you can continue spawning its trigger (picking up technical data)
---
Other dailies are supposed to reset at 8pm eastern time, but some are broken. For example Stings and things seems to be mostly unlimited with a server hop or two to re-proc, and queen of the hunt seems to be every 4 or so days (not sure if this is international). Camden park dailies can be "multiple" if you skip a day. They seem to accumulate if you don't complete one.

---
I die pretty constant even with Serendipity max'd tbh.  Guessing my Luck isn't high enough.
---
In theory, but the shrouded effect has been broken from day 1 and doesn't work. It's been tested several times over the two years the game has been out on youtube. Shadowed mod was broken also for everything else but leather armors, but it got fixed recently and now works on all armors that have it.
---
Dodgy in agility, Serendipity in Luck.
---
I guess but it's still a shame.
---
That's genuinely kinda sad. I thought people would know how to do it by now.
---
Yeah, sry about that. But i at least used an english name for it.
---
German would be: Der Bienenstock!
---
Does anybody search through the sub before posting????This horse is dead buried and decomposed
---
I hear ya, but I just hate putting expensive perks into carry weight when there are so many other specials I'd like to add.
---
Okay, I'll try that.
---
Sounds promising
---
First rule of negative posts. Delete your post or take your lickings, never try to explain yourself into a better upvote tally.
---
Man that sucks and it’s on the worst time
---
There is no flaw in your logic.
---
I will add ya when I get home later. And the friend request should show up in the launcher.
---
Then it's a bug problem,  not a design problem.
---
But still doesn't make it the best for stealth. Since it doesn't work.
---
Ive been slow walking since the sale started. I'm to cheap to just drop stuff unless it's super low level and I'm dropping it right infront of new players. Mind you all I've been doing is bobblehead hunting in people's vendors but it's nice to go for a jog once in awhile. 
---
You forget how big Appalachia actually is with constantly fast travelling.
---
even if it wasn't bugged I don't think it'd outperform other armor types by much, if at all.
---
I've PM'd you :)
---
I say enjoy the power while it lasts then haha
---
I know, it's frustrating.  I'm tempted to pick up a second account on the next sale just for secure self storage to make inventory management less of a headache.
---
It's one of those things though where decreasing time spent on inventory management may actually yield greater returns per hour than improving combat effectiveness, and be better for own one's sanity.  So, MAYBE giving up a legendary perk for more carry capacity will be worth it...maybe...
---
Int is the one I kind of hate more...the 10% XP for 5 points of Int is SO good, but man it gets hard to find enough decent perks under there for some builds.  I run 5 Int now, and I can add another 3 points of reasonable-ish perks, but after that it's kind of ehhhhhh.  Almost every Int perk works better just as a swap at camp.
---
Bog Wanderer mask and prison collar. Nothing else.
---
Iron fist goes to level 3.
---
I use it for my power fist.

I actually prefer this due to being a chameleon.

Okay thanks I was just poking fun at myself lol
---
All this gets lost in internet translation
---
Getting your account hacked is a real thing... but it doesn't happen to a handful of people.  If you have hackers getting into a companies servers they're not going to get away with a handful of passwords, this is what happens when you have massive data breaches that leak the account information for essentially everyone using that service.
---
When you have a relative handful of accounts getting compromised it doesn't tend to have anything to do with their "account" getting "hacked" but the user getting compromised.  Users get compromised most often through keyloggers and phishing.
---
What people need to do is turn on the fucking two factor authentication that's been in the game for months now.
---
It’s gonna be replaced with “Why did all the challenges autocomplete?” 🤣
---
What Rads for sure, Luck, and Infiltrator (for convenience)
---
Considering STR, but need to actually understand how the system will work - I’m already at 15 STR before armor bonuses and such, so not sure how much that one will actually help.
---
TBH with the current way of how damage dealt is calculated, the DR/ER doesn't make that much of a difference either.
---
I'm thinking infiltrator just at rank 1.
---
I'm probably going to move 5 out of strength and put them all into charisma to share bloody mess. Then put 5 back into strength for bandolier and blocker.
---
Definitely still thinking it over.
---
Also, Carnivore mutation is supposed to be good for melee, I've heard.
---
I have been ! I’ve been that arsehole we all hate sat on top of something 1 shotting  everything.
---
Ahh those were the hours :)
---
Tried locking my doors but nope they got the keys to my house apparently.
---
This makes sense, and it likely would be possible considering npcs and robots can already tell what clothes or armour you are wearing or whether you are on chems or not and I think what gun you carry. And make relevant comments about it. Wouldnt be much of a leap to make this a deciding factor in whether an noc is hostile or not.
---
This is a bug from Fallout 4 that carried over to 76. What’s worse is that the community fixed this bug, along with many others. I don’t know why Bethesda didn’t just take the huge community bug patch and implement it into 76.
---
Too late.traded it for a new brain for rex.
---
I am tired of worrying about feeding my primed minigauss.
---
Yeah, I'm still looking at it...very tough choices given the high cost of a legendary perk point.
---
Nope, I haven’t bothered starting it because it seems the majority of the community doesn’t understand the mechanic that is involved.
---
Don't try and rush things. You're new.    
---
Wastelanders is best done and finished after level 50, IMO.    
---
Many quest rewards regarding gear are leveled according to your level in 5-10 level increments. If you finish a quest now and get gear it will be level 10. If you wait to turn it in or finish it after 15 but before 20  it will be 15. Some gear are static drops though and those could be higher level.    
---
Depending on your build if you're not melee and you get a certain static reward then it's largely useless. More importantly, if you have the plans for most things then the Purveyor will have a slightly higher chance of rewarding you with the same type.    
---
Some people say it's best to grind certain enemies in certain locations but IMO BORING. Side quests, events, and Daily quests can net a lot of experience. The more daily quests you find and open the more they reset every day. At lower levels you can get 3 levels fairly easy.
---
Is there some specific scarecrow from the Atomicshop that I have missed? As I put down scarecrows on all sides of my camp but enemies couldn't care less, sometimes even taking it as cover while shooting at my idle turrets...
---
That sounds like a bug that needs to be fixed then.  Give it a year.
---
He means this topic gets covered at least once a week..
---
operation health was the worst thing that ever happened to siege, as it fixed basically nothing.
---
Ah ok thank you
---
That really sucks
---
Im on xbox. Managed to get a full set for 6k anyway though
---
My main is 118 so that's three slots for every character.    
---
My main is lacking in END, INT, and CHA but I don't group much. I'll likely get the Chem one and INT and END.
---
I was just thinking the same about wearing ritual bindings and cultist mask, and cultists.
---
I see...well, that perk maxed will make it rain ammo when stacked with ammosmith and super duper!
---
If he has such a problem with it maybe he should stop scrolling so much and smell the fresh air. No need to leave a condescendingly rude comment because it’s “said before” seriously... some people act like they have nothing better to do.
---
If you're the only one in there, there is an unending supply of enemies intent on killing you.  
---
If you aren't able to handle a constant stream of damage, you will die.  
---
That's why they keep saying stuff like is "level 50+."  
---
So it could be potentially viable for leveling if you have friends, but on your own it's likely more hassle than it's worth. I wouldn't be able to tell you the exp. gains on it though, as I never bothered to pay it any mind.  
---
It is good on ammo return though, if you have at least a moderately efficient weapon. .50 Cal, for example, I always turned a profit.  
---
The LMG on the on the other hand, was less than ideal.
---
Nerd rage and serendipity 
---
Uny assassins sentinel armor
---
Quantums

A prayer to Todd the God
---
But fortunately when you are soloing the place you don't get swarmed by enemies like in 4 man team, you only get 1 or 2 enemies from each wave. That was my observation from roughly 20 runs there, of which maybe 15 were solo.
---
I'm tiny bit concerned that newer people will start doing the ops in public teams for ultracite ammo farming and not actually trying to do them in time for Elder rank. The yields were that good for 2/3 shot builds/weapons.
---
1200 hours and only been attacked at a workshop once. But clearly this is a major issue that we should be focusing on instead of the half dozen currently existing damage bugs, or all the hacked weapons being paraded around boss events, or the fact that people make a living selling duped gatling plasmas...
---
So if everyone closed your door every single time...wouldn't that make you have to wait a second every single time you go to your camp? Most of the time I go to mine for like 2 minutes just to drop something off or grab something. I would be more annoyed if they closed them honestly. Hell half the time I don't even put a door on at all.
---
Grab a baseball bat and a shotgun, kill everything.
---
The color is green
---
I'm doing fine with what my main char has. Glass canons are not fun.
---
Did you have to start a new game for the Outer Worlds or could you continue by traveling to another planet? (Sorry for the off).
---
I use serendipity, dodgy, barbarian, nerd rage, blocker, lone wanderer, and evasive for perk cards. It helps out a ton.
---
I can carry nearly 600 pounds and not have to rely on power armour with a bloodied build, not sure why you care so much but this is getting boring. You aren't understanding that my full set of legendary 3 stars isnt worth a bit of accuracy and penetration if everything dies almost instantly anyway. I never said you shouldnt use power armour I said I dont think it's worth it for me. Coming in here calling me names for playing how I want go away
---
One of the forum rules (and therefore expectations) is that members use the search function prior to posting. 
---
While his approach could have been more diplomatic, the point is valid.
---
Jesus those skins Khaki green skins sound wonderful. Why won't beth release them if there are buyers?
---
Ah and yeah i know the Blood eagle paint for the Trapper armor. I mean currently the Trapper armor has total of 0 skins for it... Atleast beth should put that Blood eagle skin to the atom shop or to some event reward pool as a Plan.
---
Saaaame
---
it's not that, I was talking about its sneaking bonuses specifically. shrouded is essentially just shadowed + sleek + ultra light.
---
most armor types have a shadowed option as well and sleek is useless if you have speed demon, which everyone does. just slap ultra light on, say, scout and you have a set that's just as capable as wood, only slightly heavier, with a lot more dr and er to boot.
---
if at least shrouded had the muffled effect as well. eh.
---
Camp Ammo Factory Glitch + Master Infiltrator =  Lots of bounties on the map
---
Next few weeks might be a good time to earn some atoms.
---
I never have anyone else by Camp McClintok. 
---
Good views of the surrounding areas. Fast run to two workshops that no one ever contests for plans and loot. 
---
Plus it’s an area people have to go to eventually so decent amount of new players.
---
What's battle-pass? And tier? I think you are talking about season, and ranks.
---
Your right, most of the time, it is not.
---
Just saying at low levels, I was still trying to understand the game, and to have all the stuff I work so hard to find (at the time) taken from me, combined with the rudeness of the other players.... I didn’t want to deal with it again, so it modified the way I play.
---
Now that I am high level, not too many people bother me/try to take my workshops.  I dont want to do to someone else what was done to me, I don’t need the mats, so I leave other people workshops alone.
---
It was intended for a sort of lightweight stealth build. But the shrouded plans are hidden somewhere in a mire quest, and it just overall sucks. They also introduced thorn armor last year, which is a much superior stealth armor, and of course the chinese stealth suit with wastelanders. So at this point wood armor died out into obscurity because it's bugged, unbalanced, and completely pointless
---
Respect, brother. Been there myself.
---
Follow through, poison resist, fire resist, endurance, luck, intelligence
---
Mutifruit bush is a poormans scarecrow
---
PA and emergency protocols
---
Or just abuse all of the effects that stack with it. Adrenal reaction and nerd rage with bloodied weapons to one shot everything, serendipity and dodgy/blocker to tank or avoid damage, and abuse that +15 agility to sneak right under everything's nose. If done right, makes the game capable of being run blindfolded unless some player comes in and draws enemies towards you
---
No doubt!! I might wait to hear some feedback before dropping a ton of points
---
Solid point there.  I’ve seen role play used once.
---
\*spoiler for fallout 3 \*
---
In fallout 3, there is a vault that is full of clones named 'Gary'. It is very creepy since as you explore through it, the clones just keep repeating the word 'Gary' over and over in creepy ways. If you haven't played fallout 3 or fallout NV, I highly recommend them (just look past the dated visuals).
---
I never waste a favorite spot in Stimpaks. That’s already assigned on the d-pad on console.
---
I have it ...  it gets slightly annoying if you spend  a lot of time at your camp . The alcohol and candy it collects is great though .
---
Yes this is just fine, stating a reasoning response without being rude. It’s possible. Thanks. I figured if it wasn’t a question, but a suggestion Bethesda would possibly make this change.
---
[this video explains it easily and comprehensively.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OONwLXf2p8)
---
Ah! Gary!
---
It's unfortunate that the event ends when you put the full amount of ore.  The event is more rewarding when you let it run the full amount of time because you can get lots of exp, ammo, scrap, chems, and even some legendary items from killing ghouls. 
---
Players appreciate it if you hold on to your ores until the last few seconds so they can farm up and that way you can also get the reward from completing the event.
---
I understand your point, and you’re welcome. This is a suggestion that has been made many times in the past. It may even be one of the ‘retired’ posts. 
---
I would love to see this implemented. It would be more fair and balanced, in my opinion.
---
Honestly it would. I put my .38 at 0 caps so people using pipe weapons don't have to worry about paying, but I feel like putting .50 Cal bullets at 1c each is ridiculous considering how many you get from crafting your own. I'd never buy them from anyone when you can make 180 in one hit with the increased ammo production perk card per hit. I can't blame anyone for never buying mine. However if I was selling them at 100 bullets per 1 cap, then that would be a WHOLE different story.
---
Does anything really show wealth anymore? And what would even be considered wealth? Red asylum outfits have been duped to hell and back, doubt that'll raise any eyebrows. If anything, the best choice is just getting something that looks cool.
---
My ally just has the silver shroud outfit/hat with a plague doctor mask. I'm wearing the ghillie mask with my thorn armor, it matches and shows off that I grinded through the NW challenges when they were up
---
I make a raised platform and stair to a second level floor and put barricades in front of the stairs.
---
Whenever I go back to fallout 4, I find it's story lacking in comparison to fallout 76. Actual mechanics and structure would point to fallout 4 being more of an RPG in my opinion, though I'd side with 76 as being a superior game. It's all subjective though..play what you like.
---
Off all the fuck ups the game has this is is ur biggest fucking please give me bethasda..ohhh sweet baby fucking jesus ur a full blown tard..
---
So it takes the fixer 2.4 seconds to empty a clip. Then 2.4 (with speed demon) to reload. So 50% of the time you are dealing 0 dps. A quad spends only 20% of its time reloading.  That means a 30% multiplicative buff. Which should stack up well against other prefixes in long boss fights.
---
Not this again...
---
while other weapon specific damage cards have 3 cards that go to 3 stars. Normal, Expert, and Master. there is no Expert or Master for Iron fist
---
Sorry mate I was on about the recipe not the serum
---
I have no problem with a player that wants to challenge my ownership and take over the workshop. Usually I will just leave and let them have it with everything already built-up. It's not like I lock anything up or such, it's all free to everyone.
---
In playing since release, I have had 3 people that just wanted to grief me. One-shot me from behind while in stealth with their magic shotgun, maybe destroy any generators or workbenches, but then just leaving again without claiming it themselves. They want to claim they are playing as raiders but raiders were collecting resources, not just grieving people.
---
Just change it so that putting ore in the machine gives substantial XP that runners are missing out on.
---
You can do this by changing your ini  file. It changes both hud color and flashlight color.
---
10/10 immersion. I'm a game where you constantly eat and drink to survive, it only makes sense that you also gain weight and must relieve yourself by dropping floater bombs.
---
Most of the time it's just a minor inconvenience, but sometimes... Whoopsies!
---
That wasn't my experience at all.  I don't remember it scaling to a lesser number at all.  Just yesterday, when it was the Cloaked Blood Eagles in the Burrows, I went to activate that first node and there were at least 7-8 of them just waiting for me.
---
I *do* think that the enemy type plays a major role in this though.  Robots and Blood Eagles are very fast and are able to keep up with the player.  Super Mutants are very sluggish, big targets, and you can outpace them.
---
One wasteland, after having only recently started playing it’s been an asinine experience having my quest log full up with quests that I couldn’t do because they all point to high level areas with no indications of such until you actually get there and get jumped by something several levels above you.
---
Well they should really get rid of one and two star creatures altogether, since three star drops only one star garbage most of the time anyways.
---
No worries!  To be honest, I wish we could modify that quick button if we wanted.
---
^This. Just get the camp stuff and start saving for Lunchboxes next season.
---
I don't know if I should apologize or not but I read that in Billy Butcher's voice from The Boys....
---
Griefers always find a way. Posting this only serves to spread the word on the exploit. Sorry you were griefed, but you should edit out specifics so others don't fall victim to this.
---
Because nine times out of ten, no one wants to help.
---
If you're running in a group where 1 or 2 players are the dedicated Pylon takers, it's easy.  But among just randos, people won't do it.  And then you'll get the asshole who just sprays everything with their hacked .50 cal the moment the Imposter is vulnerable, denying everyone their prize.
---
Either stealth or PA with emergency protocols mod. A single point in born survivor is handy but can chew through stims fast. Serendipity can be good but I find that if I'm not in armour, then I'm probably sneaking and not getting hit In the first place.
---
But, they can "smell" an imposter
---
That's a shame
---
I used to dress as santa claus, then later as the silver shroud (with the santa claus beard)... that was on my xbox with freely obtained atoms. Waiting for those items to wind up in the atomic shop again.
---
for fo76 just go into the .dll its one of the RGB format inputs
---
Look how upset youre gettin over internet comments man grow up💀
---
Or fixing your weapon in the middle of an Earl right. Takes forever!
---
There's going to be a new public group type that awards bonus xp for Daily Ops. Only way to know if it's efficient is to run it a few times and work out how much xp/hour you're getting from it.
---
I assume it will be pretty decent.
---
evirus, sounds like you are low level.  dont assume because of onewasteland, now you can go ANYwhere.  onewasteland wont scale ANY area to your level.  each baddie will have  min and max level scale. for example lets say you are level 25, you probably will see that scorchbeast will still be level 50 minimum.
---
Set VM
---
GeForce is being used. 
---
Nothing wacky in the background
---
We had issues and I remedied them for just on laptop. When she hooks up the external monitor, that’s when it goes to hell. Meanwhile, I’m running just fine. Sigh.
---
The Jam?
---
Highest rank unlocks all the ones below it as well.  Ideally, you want to get the highest the first time out, because I guess the probability of getting a rare prize stacks when you unlock the previous ones at the same time.  Or so they said in the ITV this week.
---
This is the whole reason I use a miners lamp hat. The Pip-Boy light sucks and barely helps your vision.
---
Same, I die all the time lol now I switch to vampire weapons on my bloodied build when the event is about to finish, so that I won’t be stuck on death screen and also lose all junks.
---
Im on xbox and have same issue sadly
---
I was going to try to pursue a new char with only  wearing Wood armor once I got the plans for all of it plus crude weapons like Cultist blades and pipe weapons. That idea has now fast gone into the trash.
---
Ironically fallout 1 and 2 also suffered from terrible inventory management menus and even weight lol.. maybe it's a call back to a bygone age
---
I totally agree. I have my first alt now. Level 9 ...I am loving running that girl through the game. I live the struggle. Still waiting for one of you to drop me some stimpaks 😅
---
RIIIGHHHT, rubber never wears out?  in what reality do you live?  and lets pretend power armor can be well sealed.  did you think that seal will survive combat conditions, repeatedly?  imagine that well placed seal, suddently a supermutant brings down his axe on your head.   you'll probably get up dazed but alive, but that seal?  nope its shredded!  next you hear a strange gurgle, turn around and a floater flamer is in your face and unleashes his hellfire in your face.  now that rubber is a pile of rubber goop.
---
Please. You can't even change the torch colour on it so I use the mining light because it has colour mods. But it looks terrible so we need the pip boy colour change again
---
luckily my ally has the bug where it just stands in one place and doesn't do anything besides spout the occasional dialogue....still annoying but at least she isn't leaving doors open or play the same 5 notes repeatedly on her guitar
---
From your perspective, it's actually \[Caution\], but the sneak multiplier no longer works.
---
It's a really bad mechanic.  You have no control over what other players do, and it makes no sense why their stealth status should affect yours.  Worse, it totally changes the rules of what \[Caution\] means without communicating this at all.  This is why people would say "Sneak is broken" or "The Sneak Damage notification isn't working."
---
Yeah i know that but in my post i stated that was not possible, i messed up building my pc putting my OS on a 120gb ssd and after the space the OS takes up and app launchers etc im left with 30-35gb avail space. And theres
---
Nothing i can delete to make space without removing my OS, but there must be another work around i mean come on, if not do they expect everyone to put this game on there OS drive only? Like whens the fix?
---
The unreal engine is from the 90s in name only. Unless you can point to code or bugs or realistically anything that they've grandfathered in from the unreal 1,2,3 or 4 engines that would make you believe that. 
---
If we take the gamebryo engine, or the creation kit, bugs from morrowind, oblivion, fallout 3, skyrim, they still appear in FO76*. Now if we compare that to bugs in let's say unreal. Does alot of games have the same bugs as gears of war, spec ops: the line, bioshock? 
---
I'm honestly trying to understand your perspective here
---
The way it works. That’s it’s always worked, 3 star have a CHANCE to drop up to a 3 star item.
---
Just as a 2 star has a chance to drop a 1 or 2 star.
---
There is only a chance of the max star from the number of stars.
---
And they ain’t changing that.
---
Not everyone has this issue, a lot depends on the UAC-settings and how and which security is installed.
---
The problem is a file that should be on the system drive, but the store installs it to the game dir. Symlinking and giving the right permissions will do the trick.
---
I just want a place-able fast travel mat. the spot I always load into when I'm at my camp is at the bottom of a mountain, and my camp is on a shear cliff. No matter which way I turn the camp thingy I always load into the same spot. It sucks because my camp is in a great spot. Easily defend-able, scenic, and near multiple resources.
---
QOL Legendary perks for sure. Seeing if I can hit 200 before Tuesday!
---
well there ya go, if you want your doors open all the time just dont use a door.  wow an extra second to get into a building?  you must really hate 99.99% of the buildings in the real world then.
---
I run it any time it pops up.
---
I'm honestly worried for 2 reasons 1 I'm a bloodied build and 2 bugs bugs everywhere
---
Depends on the rolls on it. Junkies and Bloodied can sell for really high, followed by Quad.
---
Came here in hopes of having a conversation about the criminally underrated 2006 Sarah Jessica Parker/Matthew McConaughey vehicle. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
---
Yeah, I'm not jumping in w/o being sure.
---
As a Herd Mentality Empath from near launch I enjoy acess to public teams but almost always had at least one friemd to team with.
---
However, during SBQ and ACP it can actually be a struggle to get others to join me or not kick me. I just wish it was easier to tell people I'm an Empath, let me help you.
---
But the handmade plan at watoga station. Others sell it as well. Maybe have to hop a couple of times
---
Yeah, I was wrong back when I said that, I had only gotten 3 star SS pieces from crafting so I didn't know you could get lower.
---
My bad.
---
Nah man, it's going to be replaced with "I'm leaving because you ruined my build."
---
You will still be on top, just a bit less easy mode
---
You often see the sneak damage numbers, but they are not being applied.  Actually they are applied but then the bonus is erased.  The net effect is no sneak bonus if anyone is detected.  Same deal with the ads at Scorched Earth if the queen gets aggro'ed.
---
Plans, not the weapon itself.
---
I'm worried that I will lose most of my gaming buddy's. 
---
95% of them are bloodied builds and they will try the nerved game for a day or 2 and then probably never return :-(
---
They will almost certainly never ‘fix’ the inventory system. They’ve had terrible UI’s in almost every single one of their games since forever. Our only real hope is mods. There are already a few mods on PC that make the inventory system way better and that’s with out proper mod support. Hopefully sometime soon they will implement the same mod support FO4 and Skyrim have so people have more tools and can bring them to consoles
---
Naked, obviously
---
My point is a dedicated time to fix the game would help imo
---
Yeah I noticed I seem to always have whatever they’re looking for. Never even paid attention to the name of the item. I just go there once a day and it’s good to go
---
Stealth is your biggest friend as a bloodied commando. You do more damage and enemies don't attack you directly. (They'll still attack your area sometimes in Caution, though).
---
If you get found, you pretty much die.
---
If you're not running a stealth commando, you're not doing full justice to your bloodied fixers.
---
Oh
---
Dude! I was just thinking about posting how excited I am, too!
---
I'm excited for repeatable dungeons to give FO a little more endgame, a new legendary run (since I didn't play much until the end of last season), and legendary perks to grind for.
---
I am a bit nervous about scaling in one wasteland. I like the idea of mobs being more challenging, but really disliked how ESO made leveling up super mundane... you felt less powerful as you leveled instead if stronger.
---
I sold one for the default price. 
---
My thinking is it's a pretty sought after weapon so the plan should go for a decent price BUT selling it for more than the vendor bot price is... well, why would they pay more (or the same) from you than them.
---
Yes there is a new update on the 15th and idk if you missed waste landers or not but those missions are here
---
It isn't required, but the accelerated barrell helps trigger magic more often with that weapon.  Just be ready to craft lots of ammo.
---
I love it. I played since beta and took a 6 month break after beating main story and came back around October of last year. I enjoyed what was in the game then and then we had wastelnader and many other things. New update this Tuesday brings one wasteland where every enemy will scale to your level so we won’t have low level enemies in forest area anymore. The brotherhood is also coming. So to me yes it’s worth it but I can’t make that decision for you. I believe the game is worth every penny I paid for it and I even bought the wastelanders edition on my PlayStation also. So now I have it on Xbox and ps4
---
That’s a solid five scrips, much better than the 3 scrip wood armor I normally get from the queen. You’re doing just fine.
---
The argument then is why have workshops be pvp zones at all?
---
I recommend a spot overlooking Prickett's Fort. Some good flat spots on the cliffs. Also a nice scenic view of the space station. Really pretty at night because of the glowing water in the distance.
---
What’s the battle coat
---
I think if this became an addition it would totally need to be in syringer dose called "Dragonrend"
---
They should just remove the camp attack mechanic altogether.
---
The T-65 one?
---
I see a few pop up here and then, i'm assuming not very often because of those expensive Recall cards.
---
I will try X.
---
Lot's of time I cannot even see PipBoy data because of the 'sun" I guess.
---
  Maybe PA mode will help.
---
The liberators are Chinese , the communist outfit is more Russian, both communists but not necessarily on the same side
---
Yeah I just wish more people did it so I could find fixer plans
---
Perks. Gotta have a solid build. Serendipity, Dodgy, Blocker, Ricochet, anything that reduces, ignores damage is a must have
---
Ss under armor ss chest and jet pack solar arms and legs grey barrett oh yeah vault scout mask
---
Don’t be, blooded will still be top on the meters, just not as easy mode as before!
---
You could...just play your xbox.
---
Bugs have been patched out overtime in unreal, but they are still the same engine. They changed code and updated it through time just like the creation kit.
---
The dumpster possibilities that I can recall:  Clarksburg somewhere, Pricketts Fort North, Black Bear Lodge and somewhere around the Kiddie Corner Cabins.
---
There are probably more, but I don't remember them.
---
I have played since beta and only launched two in two years but last two weeks I’m Finally using those 30 nuke cards I had. I haven’t had a problem with the codes on Xbox at all, I did forget which silo I was at once and put wrong code in but I do have a bunch of them. I know codes on nukacrypt worked as of this morning
---
Edit if you start a new character and play on Xbox we can run silo together
---
We are calling you Bethasda until you give us pip-boy lights!
---
Maybe the 1001st time will actually make bethesda have a change of heart and let everybody have what they want without RNG grinding. Not like their entire game is based off that model and would run dry in a month without it or anything
---
Commando is definitely doable without sneak. I think most of us are using sneak and covert operative together to get as much dps as possible (2.5 times more damage per shot is kinda hard to pass up). Keep in mind also with that most things are killed pretty quick so you don’t need to worry about losing your sneak status (hidden/caution). The only time sneak truly doesn’t work is fighting Earle and the queen when you’re surrounded by power armor/heavy gun builds as they tend to negate sneak for you if they’re close by. And from I understand with the daily ops coming next week, sneak won’t even work at all during the daily ops missions, which is gonna force a lot of sneak commandos, myself included, to change out some perks for something that will work better. 
---
In short, if you don’t wanna sneak, use those three points elsewhere. And 3 more if you don’t use covert ops.
---
I think it looks silly also except the chest piece
---
I just want brighter lights...
---
I don't know. I use the regular in game scarecrow plans. It's not perfect but it works (like Todd). My scarecrow gets destroyed occasionally.
---
Why?
---
They have to be used in VATs so all the pellets count as one action
---
Are you planning on using food buffs? I generally run carnivore and just kill stuff when I need food. I don't think chem resistant is necessary. I use the addictions for the chems I regularly use on both my junkies characters.
---
Someone was posting about this just now in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/is0go5/need_help_please_with_my_fixer/) so I've updated the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f4dDlj-2q24GIUeAeQKp2lNhvjy-T4vlEcHux3Y6YEk/edit?usp=sharing) (which I forgot to set to public here...) with numbers comparing the quad ffr fixer to bloodied ffr fixer. I ended up getting that the quad is 14% ahead using the new additive buff math for an otherwise bloodied stealth commando.
---
I mainly did the ops when they were testing mutants (few robots) so guess it could have been because of that then. I always ran straight to the objectives without stopping for anything, and got waves (quite frequently) of 1 mutant and hound. And 1-2 robots. Could be that they adjusted the amounts too. I's been awhile since i was there.
---
Why though? Have they ever come out and say so? Just because they havent done it in the past doesnt mean they cant do it at some point. It seems like such an obvious issue, being mentioned by the community and reviewers alike, you think they will ignore it forever?
---
Yep. I carry and use both. Bloodied melee weapons, bloodied handmade and junkies fixer, bloody 50 cal and junkies lmg.
---
Low health junkie does less than bloodied but more than full health junkie. If you're used to being at 20% health already... Just start taking chems and get addicted.
---
Maybe the damage drops off too much for you. Maybe not. Hang onto an addictol in case you hate it.
---
Settler opens door.  Another player walks in.  Settler closes door.  Player must now pick your lock and get wanted to leave.  That's why not.
---
Yeah cause someone was selling for 5k and was unsure
---
.ini edits are native to any Bethesda game veteran lol.
---
It is, but houses built on a golf course just look daft.
---
Mutant slayer pitchfork ( * ) seems like a good trade for my +600 pcs. of  .50 cal ammo 👍
---
Thanks though
---
FO1 and 2 both have way better menus than fo3/4/76 though. Not optimal, but way better. And those games are really REALLY old. In fact if they would implement the fo2 menus for fo76 it would drastically improve the game.
---
Thanks but I'm on PS4
---
I'm not saying the game is bad but I just opened a locker with the mole miner's key and that shit was empty 😤😤😤
---
Boi you don’t play on no Series X, stop lyin
---
It is.  My QE Fixer can kill Earle in roughly the same time as my BFFR.  I've tested it numerous times.  In situations where there is lots of trash, it gets the job done faster than any of my others.  The only drawback is that it uses more ammo.
---
Nice!
---
Not looking forward to season 2 honestly...this little break inbetween seasons was great...no having to log in daily to grind everything. I could choose to log in or not log in whenever I wanted...and I chose to not play the game at all. Felt wonderful lol.
---
The only thing I was looking forward to was the instanced camp bunker/cellars they mentioned but idk the ETA on that stuff...
---
There are tons of post of people asking for or offering help, but yep people is pretty whiny
---
Not more than you could buy it from one of the Vendor Bots.
---
There was a time, long ago, when the Handmade plan was very hard to get.  It was a level-locked plan, but implemented backward, so you basically had to be something like below Lv. 15, but make it to Harper's Ferry and find it at the Vendor Bot there.
---
Yes there’s so many options with armor and all the effects you can get I’m working on assassins sentinel solar armor I have one piece it’s going to be a long grind lol I have a set of unyielding sentinel combat armor but it’s not right for me I think it would be better for a bloodied build and I like full health
---
Pretty sure the suppressor will still look like shit just like the gold paint and blood eagle paint.
---
Because.
---
Now go to your room. 
---
Think about what you’ve done.
---
Yesterday I did One Violent Night and got a 1* Bloodied The Tenderizer from the wendigo at the end which I immediately put the peppered mod on.
---
This reply is underrated.
---
Yes. Planning on using food buffs specifically Smoked Mirelurk Fillet, Mirelurk Egg Omelette, Cooked Softshell Meat, Glowing Meat Steak, and Tasty Squirrel Stew. Most of the meat for those can be gained just from mirelurk spawns. Glowing Meat Steak &gt; Yogi Bear Roast due to glowing meat being a much simpler and easier to craft/farm recipe.
---
As for Chem Resistant, it's there as a sort of Starched Jeans for my addictions. This way, I keep the 5 I want and don't get any extra.
---
&gt; Flat plus water is rare, flat plus water plus resource is even rarer but does exist.
---
People need to get over their obsession with these two things and allow themselves to build in more interesting locations. Having a resource to build an extractor on is nice but 100% not required. As for water you can build 2 of the small ones that can be placed on dry land and that's more than enough to keep you hydrated. There's absolutely no reason you need to have 5+ of the large ones in a water source unless you don't actually play the game and they're your only source of caps from the vendor robots.
---
Convers away lol
---
I join when it pops up. But the lag/massive FPS drop it creates on pS4 can be awful and very annoying
---
Seems fairly solid to me. You’ll definitely be tough to take down, I was full health PA melee for a long time and dying was rare but damage was good enough.
---
I have not used a junkies melee build but I’m sure it will have some good power. If you haven’t tried it, instigating might also be worth a shot.. or at least keeping one handy. 
---
An instigating two hand with increased swing speed and you would be one hitting most mobs quickly. Junkies and buffs would definitely suit you better for “bosses” I’d think though. 
---
Keep in mind that right now junkies might one hit most enemies also (I’m thinking lvl 68 ferals), but with the next update.. if you are a high level character the ranking mobs might take more hits to take down.
---
If you end up not being happy with the damage output of full health in general, I can say for sure that a low health PA Melee build has some pretty great numbers and you’re still pretty tough. Emergency protocols on PA really help keep you alive in that situation as well.
---
Commies like to kill each other so no biggie. Just think about the hundreds of millions victims worldwide and then think twice wearing their outfit. What's next? Nazi swastikas and Hitler oufit??
---
B2525 is currently better. But after watching angry turtles video on the new damage formula. Explosive may be the way to go come tuesday.
---
Yeah I might do the same
---
Try sneaking, those are stealth commando weapons, that's the optimal way to play them
---
We need a favorites system
---
Funky duds, sizzling style, ammo factory, the one with the fusion core, strength and agility
---
Sounds like a thrilling adventure.
---
Pretty good silo weapon.
---
Then don’t fast travel, no loading screens, problem solved /s
---
I’m excited to see what breaks. I don’t get all worked up like other people on here about things, but let’s be honest it seems every patch brings a new disaster.
---
But what I'm confused about is how sneak is viable. You have to be hidden to get that 2.5x damage. Which means it cant always be an option. Once you shoot that first shot your sneak is gone. Unless I'm missing something in the sneak skills you suggested.
---
You drink green coffee?
---
&gt; running around in a cow costume what happened to the wasteland vibe fallout had
---
[Bosco would like to have a say on that issue.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Bosco)
---
B2525 100% explosive is trash against bosses. It’s only viable against mobs
---
Hunters hood
---
I'm looking forward to the Legendary Perks, specifically Ammo Factory as my guns are hungry these days, and the Daily Ops.  
---
I have missed Vault 94 since the day it left, so it'll be good to go home.
---
Are there specific questions you have? What are you having trouble with? There's no "proper" way to play the game - just follow the story and play the style you prefer.
---
Thank you I will check them out. I know I’ve seen the ones on top of mountains and they’re awesome. Today was first time in months I went to a camp and it was under ground. Use to see them all the time but not much lately. Had to sit on a electric chair to get down. I love checking those camps out. So neat, I still remember first one I ever went to. It was right next to whitesprings near the rad dump and you had to goto port a potty and I kept thinking how do I go in the camp and the owner showed me and I was like damn this is nuts. Such a creative community and then you had my Camp that was just two floors of walls, floors and benches. Only used my camp atom challenges and that was it. But seeing the other camps made me wanna do this stuff better. Again I thank you for giving me some spots
---
:)   Yes.  Although I haven't come close to deciding which one(s) should be developed first.   It took me a long time to decide on the cards alone.
---
Why is this magic? I hear of these “magic” weapons but I don’t understand why. Is there something I should look for or should no be trying every gun I get to see if the damage is way more than it states.
---
If you listen to the video he also says explosive damage does not get stealth damage multiplier, so for an obvious stealth commando/rifleman weapon that will not be the case. It will be good for builds that do not use stealth, like heavy weapons which he is testing in the video. And also, you have to remember that explosive won't be that good againts bosses.
---
Enjoy the mutton my friend🐑🐑🐑 😁
---
Both, I prime the 2525 for boss fights and use normal ammo in the explosive one for daily use
---
Damn. So this whole time I thought I was doubling my damage when I'm really just sneaking for nothing.
---
Ammo Factory for sure as #1 and focus on upgrading to max asap.
---
Master Infiltrator for obvious reasons but i probably keep it at lvl 1 until all other perks are done.
---
Legendary END and STR bc i have only 2 END and 6 STR.
---
Follow Through for enhanced stealth att.
---
Dont know about the 6th slot yet.
---
Because people won't do the pylons and, out of the six times I've been there, I've only seen it succeed once.   And then I couldn't find her body.
---
Bloodied stealth commando is the highest DPS in the game for solo content. So go for that if you're trying to min max. However heavy gunner is also very respectable damage and some people (myself included) have a lot more fun with it. I run heavy gunner because I can use the same special spread for  a melee build and a shotgunner build if I want to, and I like being able to switch loadouts on the fly.
---
I haven't had this until I moved my camp this week. I placed her on the roof. It's been so nice. On that note, Bethesda I shouldn't be hearing her footsteps from the ground floor and outside.
---
Oh no, I just heard that this game is way more fun to play with other people haha
---
If you have to choose between the two, go with B2525. But eventually get the BE25 too for different situations. I personally use 3 weapons, B2525 Fixer, BE25 Handmade and VE25 Fixer (trying to get rid of fixers as i love handmade looks as a raidery type character/player).
---
I don't like gear and things that require the char to be gimped. We don't all have the same skill level.
---
The only thing about this fact , is if they end up giving us one , then everybody has it and you see the same thing everywhere , it makes sense for every faction to have a unique skin or colour for out fav weapons
---
I wonder if it makes sense to swap in ammo factory once in awhile when you are going to craft a ton at once?? Looks like a great perk but I'm not sure I want it equipped all the time. 🤔
---
Once you shoot, sneak isn’t immediately gone. You could still be “hidden” provided your target is dead. You could be put into “caution” which would still be sneaky. The only time you’d really lose your sneak is if you’re not using a suppressor because the noise would alert nearby enemies.
---
Idk, right now is where all the crying is happening. I feel like this will be a wastelanders scenario where everything else will get drowned out by people talking about the new stuff and the inevitable new game breaking bug(s) from the patch. At least for the first few days. Then people can get back to bitching about how their mega min-maxed build takes 35 seconds instead of 25 to solo the SBQ
---
They’re giving you COVID.
---
Crater and Foundation areas have good locations too, people visit them all the times for dailies and quests.
---
Are you on xbox?  Every time I run it and throw it out in LFG Heavy hitters who know what they are doing show up. And I say this knowing that bloodied builds (like me) struggle a bit with the conduit piece.
---
Im curious about this too!
---
THIS GAME IS SHIT BALLS! I NOW HAVE TO USE 2 BULLETS TO KILL THINGS INSTEAD OF 1!111!!1!!!!
---
I've played over 1200 and had a fight maybe 6 times. It's always been when I'm on my high levels too.
---
Cosmetic
---
These foodbuffs also stack for some crazy damage:  
---
Deathclaw wellington  
---
Glowing meat steak  
---
Mutant hound chops  
---
Mutant hound stew  
---
Mutton chops  
---
Mutton meat pie  
---
Yao guai ribs  
---
Yao guai roast
---
You don't need Chem Resistant if you're a Junkie's build, just stick to the five chems you plan on being addicted to. The chem from the Brawling Chemist perk is non-addictive and doesn't stack with normal chems so keep that in mind.

Carnivore is a good idea for all the melee food buffs. I prefer a Refrigerated Backpack to Good With Salt but I'm guessing you're running the Grocer's backpack instead; it's up to you, but consider replacing Good With Salt with Thru-Hiker and switching backpack mods. The 3 AGI is more beneficial than 3 LCK for melee. Or just replace it with Bloody Mess, which is a perk you should have either way. You can dump Butcher's Bounty too and move those three PER somewhere else, trust me you won't need it to keep your meat up. More END for the Fireproof perk and a little HP wouldn't be a bad idea, or more CHA for Suppressor. There's better defensive options than Bodyguards, too. 
---
You have no reason not to take the Grounded mutation as a melee build, and with Class Freak, Scaly Skin is a good choice too. If you're using lots of chems Healing Factor probably isn't worth it, even with Class Freak.
---
IMO every 2h melee build needs a good Instigating weapon, even if you're running Junkie's. Keep Junkie's for bosses, but Instigating will help you one-shot most common mobs.
---
Same. Only a few times have I been attacked. I claim any easy/ unclaimed workshop that I find myself near. Xp is xp.
---
How about
---
no
---
Yes it is for sure. Come Sept 15 monsters will be rebalanced so low and high levels can fight the same stuff. You'll be able to join most public group activities at just about any level when that comes.
---
Until then, I would try to look for fellow new players or veteran players who are levelling new characters to hang out with :)
---
I hope so I missed most of events last year. I took a break for about six months and when I came back in October I didn’t play everyday until after Christmas because of the holidays so I missed all the awesome events. Glad I got to experience them this year so hopefully we get it
---
It kinda seems like aa5025/aa2525 paired with a bloodied build is going to be the most effective earl/sbq tool.
---
Than BE25 will be best "general purpose". Even though explosions dont benefit drom stealth they still can hit multiple times. To top it off you cant use stealth in daily ops, so explosive would be welcome.
---
Ps i didnt downvote lol
---
Do you scrap or store when you breakdown your camp?
---
I can't wait for One Wasteland.
---
There's loads of locations and events around the ash heap and forest area that I haven't explored, because why bother? All the enemies there will be weak-ass level 10-25 ghouls and shit, so the loot will suck. One Wasteland means I'll get lvl 50 legendaries and there will be more farming locations.
---
You have to do it in pieces.
---
I dont know a lot about it but my friend tried to explain it to me - this encounter with the shotgun is the first I've had with a "magic weapon" 
---
I thinks it's something to do with a weapon/ armour having very specific legendary effects which make it insanely powerful (I.e the shotgun here could wipe legendary scorchbeast with a few shells 7 I think it was? according to my friend anyway) 
---
Theres a few combos
---
Mate what’s with being a keyboard warrior? 🤣
---
idk i feel like most of the clothing fits pretty well i mean not every piece of clothing is going to be completely destroyed and water does still exist so clothing can be cleaned.  if you want something that gives off merc vibes the insurgent outfit is really nice. could use a darker recolor or alternate version but still, I like it.
---
Honestly, don’t be afraid to find a build or play style you like a go for it. Not everything has to be “min/max” and highest damage possible. That being said, Bloodied is best by far, stealth commando is really great with it. Then there is Junkies which requires some maintenance but still good. If you just want plain old full health, non junkies, that’s ok and viable too!
---
That and encryptid
---
Oh I thought they meant the bos combat armor paint
---
Thanks for clearing this up!
---
I don't play this anymore, this comment's a month old.
---
If they do alot of things to boost the game, I'd expect to pay a some for that. No reason to spend money upgrading a game to then give it out free.
---
AA is getting boosted but bloodied should still be the top prefix. That said, i traded myself a AA2525 Handmade already just in case.
---

---
All the fallouts are here, always on when i play.
---
Let it chase you to the nearest band of enemies, let them do the work
---
Okay lol I've given away all my legendaries up to this point. SMH. I miss my explosive 10mm sub.
---
Then thank god I just bought a vampires 50 Cal today.
---
can confirm i've seen a few selling it for the default bot vendor price and i have maxed out hard bargain perk so i bought it from a bot instead at a much cheaper price
---
Because the almighty random number generator
---
I don’t really understand your point.  But I still say I’m just stating what I see.   There is very few pvps going on in fallout 76.   It is what it is.
---
I have 3 bloodied fixers. First one was from purveyor it is 250 damage resistance while reloading and 50 more critical damage second one a guy gave me because some one messed up a trade I had setup to trade a tendy plan for a b2525 fixer so he gave me a be +1 perception fixer and last night purveyor game me another bloodied fixer 15 vats fill and bashing damage. I hope they don’t goto shit after this update. But I guess it’s good I have a explosive one after watching angry turtle video. So I prob would go with be
---
Right bloodied is still the best generally. But adrenal reaction + nerd rage paired with ANTI armor may still end up doing more to an enemy with 80% damage reduction and 400 DR. Havent seen an actual test yet. But hopefully will get more info on Tuesday.
---
you can just drop it (or scrap it if you're near a bench)
---
Pretty sure they removed stacking buffs from similar sources, didn't they?
---
No I had no idea
---
The Traveling (or regular) Leather Coat is probably the closest thing you are looking for. Disclaimer, the outfit is a rare drop and quite expensive trading wise.
---
I’m just Curious, why would you scrap it? 
---
You can always just drop it, right?
---
That will destroy it immediately from what I know, If it’s because of inventory management.
---
Because you can't spell "grind" without "RNG."
---
I just build up walls around the fusion generator at the energy plant so that only ppl with marsupial can get into, but then I have it full of turrets
---
I always have a VE25 on swap. Hands down my favorite roll. Its healing is AMAZING.
---
Actual have 2x VE25 10mm on my gunslinger.  One moddied auto and one moddie semi auto. So i can swap geurilla/gunslinger on the fly and not have to keep modding my weapons.
---
I can recommend not using a fat man.....
---
For me the only issue has been people abusing chameleon effects.
---
Yea explosive is good for many things, like for vampire weapons as explosive damage procs another heal effect on top of the normal hit. Like i commented on this thread "I personally use 3 weapons, B2525 Fixer, BE25 Handmade and VE25 Fixer". It's good to have options for different situations.
---
No worries, i don't care about those meaningless numbers that don't serve any purpose :)
---
Yeah, it needs a buff icon in the lower right corner with all the other icons when an empath joins your team.
---
The mothman decor will also look good for Halloween coming up.
---
there's only like 6 or 7 plans you need to learn to have them start dropping. everything else is already in the pool
---
I wait for C.A.M.P. shelter which are basically underground (instanced) camps. I just hope they will be like these Vault 88.
---
But why do you want to scrap it?
---
the statue itself is available via atom shop, it's just not a part of that bundle and not out right at the moment.
---
Yeah they're really nice, i dont do any communist rp but i'd deff rock em. Honestly  there's so much cool unreleased stuff I'd like to see out, I assume there's just bugs with it they haven't got round to sorting
---
Yes we will know more in few days when the math guys start grunching numbers.
---
YES. Taller foundations to allow placement on steeper grades *and* making foundations snappable to them would be absolutely fantastic.
---
I want to slap my cabin on a hill and make a nice wraparound deck or something. I hate having that basic metal staircase going straight to my door.
---
Edit - making the foundation legs taller as well would be nice so they don't float.
---
I don't mind but in return make 1 and 2 star enemies more common than 3 star ones. I have met latter one much more than former ones.
---
You can't.  It's a public event and just pops up when it pops up.
---
This is what I hoped they would do after Wastelanders dropped. Just release the update, release ACP, and then focus there efforts on fixing the game.
---
I’m just going to jump in and say that serendipity and dodgy should not be necessarily required in your build to survive. With a full set of unyielding and sneak at max rank you should have no trouble staying under caution in any fight. Throw in a piece or two with harder to detect and walk right up to wendigoes in ACP without going into danger. IMO and that of some of the people I play with these points are better spent in agility for more sneak bonuses or luck for better vats damage.
---
I’m not saying go full bloodied killer first run, but look to change these perks out later in your playtime. Start noticing if you are able to remain hidden. Notice where higher level bloodied players put themselves to avoid environmental and splash damage. If you are in ACP and your group has good damage on Earle, it’s a good place to watch how bloodied builds navigate an area where multiple things could kill them instantly if they land. Once you get a feel for it you can move away from the more health sustain perks and into the better sneak/more damage perks. Those more damage focused perks make a huge difference in those instances where you need to kill tanky or a mass amounts of enemies relatively quickly.
---
I sell recipes for 10k caps every once and awhile. When millions of presents were floating around, some players sat at the enclave opening presents and buying recipes. Once you learned every one, the rest became a caps sink. I’m still sitting on about 75. Sometimes they sell right away, sometimes takes days. 10k for something that sells for 17k is a pretty good deal.
---
But then anyone in liberty prime PA should be able to kill you,
---
Well your ability to equip cards in NW depends on how many points you have in each stat in adventure. Just wondering if for instance, I equip the charisma legendary card and rank it up to max... will those extra 5 points of space for equipping perk cards carry over?
---
It’s been 26 years since the bombs dropped and WV wasn’t really hit directly.  The wide variety of available clothing is acceptable.
---
Only weapons/armor released in wild appalachia or wastelanders are affected by this. All the base game stuff is in the pool by default. This includes things like scout armor, ultracite gatling lasers, pipe revolvers, etc. - legendary variants were added with the purveyor update during wild appalachia, but they have existed in the game since launch
---
Did you completely miss the "could" that was towards the end of what I posted implying that it may or may not be still sealed? Or even read the bit of lore I copied and pasted, the part where it says "with reasonable safety as long as the armor is not compromised" did you not catch that?
---
Good point. I forgot to take in account for hard bargain.
---
What platform?
---
Boo
---
Boooooo
---
It fucken better
---
I run a anti armor explosive gun and a anti armor non explosive and switch back and forth when I don’t want to effect my surroundings the explosive will bring out ghouls while the non explosive I can sneak around like in Wes-tek
---
You could probably trade that BE handmade for a good heavy weapon and melee weapon combo over on one of the trade subs.
---
You don't need that much perception on a str focused build. DR is overrated. Removing refractor will be unnoticeable and give you 4 more pts to play with.
---
Thank you! Solved my problems!
---
Annoys the life out of me, my camp is very close to the whitespring train station, I did have my vendors behind doorways so i could just switch between solid walls and doorways when I was full on caps. This was the easiest work around for settlers opening locked doors. Now though Bethesda have stopped that, so instead I have had to redesign my camp so the vendors are behind a powered shutter door.
---
This is exactly what I do now but yeah, half the time other people don't collect the ore. I don't get it. Grab one of the free hazmat suits, take a diluted rad-x, and go collect the ore. I use X-01 Power Armor and my health bar is 60-70% full of rads when done collecting each arm of the mine. Then I take a decon shower, rinse and repeat. Once I've completed all four I dump them or, sometimes, wait until we already have 60 so we immediately complete it.
---
Ideally you would have 5 people or more; three to gather ore and two to protect/heal the scavengers.
---
I'm still trying to get the radiation barrel plan and the Emmet Mountain hazmat suit.
---
I think I’ve had in total two people take a workshop from me and I’ve been playing for a long time now
---
Amen. Plus no killing yourself on a tree branch
---
throwing knives.  great way to keep that melee build focus and still have ranged weapons.  also easy to make and do good damage to low level enemies
---
I'll actually never do min/max because you never know what will be nerfed or bugged out next.   I think flexibility might be something to consider with this game, especially considering how Daily Ops will occasionally be hard on one particular build or another.
---
Yes but actually no, how do you edit this file on console ? Also why we need to do this manually when in fo4 there is an option for it.
---
I, too, would like a fast travel mat. I'd put it on top of a pressure plate hooked up to a bunch of flamethrowers. Free junk!
---
**Edit:** Well, I can't say I didn't ask for it. But at least I hope people understand that this is the exact reason why we don't have a way to directly control where players spawn.
---
Encrypted can turn out two ways. You play with a lobby where everybody wants to attack and nobody wants to be conduit. “I’m bloodied, I’m a low level, I don’t have a lot of good weapons, blah blah” regardless people don’t want to be a conduit. 
---
Or you get the really good team where everybody knows exactly what to do. And we can kill her in about 5 minutes. 
---
But 90% it’s always the first option. So people don’t bother joining the event. Wasting stimpacks and ammo for an event that will most likely fail.
---
Yeah, my friend had no idea. He's not the type to read popups/prompts/text though so that doesn't help. He got absolutely blindsided by some guy and was real salty about it until I told him that's what can happen when you claim a workshop. Then he read the box the next time he claimed a workshop and was like "ohhhh."
---
I'd be okay with the plans just smoothing out the ground like some of them kinda sorta do sometimes when they work. I don't just want flat land all around me, but I wouldn't mind the ability to landscape.
---
Nice. I just used one to take out a legendary Sheepsquatch with less than 8 shells.
---
Are you looking to do a low health build or full health? What type of heavy gun do you want to use? Those will be a big factor in where you should put your points at.
---
The first two things that stand out to me is removing solar powered and batteries included. Solar powered isn’t worth the timeframe you get the benefit, and batteries included is especially pointless to have if you aren’t using an energy weapon.
---
It depends on how you like playing the game.  do you like melee weapons? Rifles? Heavy weapons? Shotguns?   Once you decide on a weapon you want your build centered around then comes researching and choosing the right perk cards and Special Point alotment.  Then you can chose low health/bloodied build or full health. 
---
Low health build put out the most damage, but its not that hard to kill everying and solo the queen as a full health build either.
---
Low health builds can die a lot more than full health but there is no real consequence for dying.  Just losing junk, but not even duing events.
---
I play a full health junkies Power armor because I love heavy weapons, they are fun to me.  And PA is almost  necessary for heavy weapons due to the stabilized perk.  
---
Do you want to be in power armor most of the time?
---
Do you want to be in stealth or crouched all the time?  Just think about what will be fun for you.
---
I'm just petty. Someone takes my workshop, I nuke their CAMP.
---
That said, the first time this ever happened to me . We fought for an hour. I finally gave up as my GF stopped having fun, and we were woefully outgeared. I stilled killed them a few times.
---
However they tracked me down after we left, thanked me for the pvp, said most people just ran or wouldn't fight, they had fun, and gave me all the mats to fix my armor.
---
The "streamsniping other players thing" is stupid. They should start banning Scammers rather then Streamsnipers. Never heard somebody cry about it. It's even the streamers choice to engage PvP with them if it's in Adventure mode.
---
Wtf are you talking about lol
---
I'd only add that unless they buff energy weapons first, laser and plasma weapons will be fancy doorstops. Aside from some legendary variants, all of them seem to be staggeringly underpowered. I mean, come on, it's a frickin' laser!
---
If you build to suit your environment it’s usually a complete overhaul and start from scratch. I know I’ve built all over the map and I always start over to make my new camp fit the new location I’ve chosen.
---
i see a lot of complaints about the damage rework but that's probably what I'm looking forward to the most.  games aren't as fun when you can just go around one-shotting everything.  where's the challenge in that?  scaling based on player lever is a great idea especially if you play with friends and aren't all the same level.  and with it comes dropped loot being scaled as well.  that and of course a lot of the new camp items coming in the next legendary run look cool.
---
The biggest nerf was the tse nerf. Btw.
---
Or even where you can exchange legendary items for vouchers and not have a limit to that, but a limit to how many scrip you can spend a day as they have now. Like the ammo converter machine.
---
I'm going to try to do it solo in under 8 minutes, as a personal challenge. But I'm fine doing it in groups too.
---
Deaf and Mute people don't have the option you dumbass
---
I played as a bloodied unarmed build. And the only thing that could really kill me was a sheepsquatch, or the miurlurk/scorchebeast Queen. Other than that I could run around jumping and killing things without a problem. If anything my biggest reason for dying was because I would fall for more than 3 feet. I ran a heavy BOS combat armor. 
---
As a bloodied shotgun build, extremely easy to kill things before they get close to you. Just like above, Only those 3 enemies I mentioned above can actually kill me. Now I’m running full secret service armor. 
---
There are a few perks you can equip that will help you dodge or avoid incoming damage. But I don’t bother using those.
---
Fair enough...I assume we’ll be asked to pay for new content down the line, which is fine by me! I mostly just want to be able to transfer my save
---
prepare to be disappointed. It shoots smoke in a straight line, fires through your walls, and generally just looks doo doo.
---
I thought about removing Refractor, but I wasn't sure what to do with the points otherwise. I figured it was helpful since it wasn't restricted by Power Armor use. Are there any perks you would suggest instead?
---
There info on this somewhere that I missed? I'm curious. I just started playing again with my GF last week.
---
Yh I agree but in fo4 its 200 years later and people still wear stuff like raiders the piont I was trying to make I and most others would like more fallout clothes take the cage outfit that looks like something g ud think to see but then you have people in normal clothes litterly t shirts and slacks with no gas mask on in the ash heap a toxic place with diseased air
---
I don't think they have for melee damage foods yet.
---
I would suggest one gun army in luck or dodgy in agility. Or just add more pts to adrenaline for that straight dps boost
---
Yh I wear it on one of my other characters I would love to see fir stuff like it or the cage armor from fo4(no idea if it's in fo76)
---
So much to unpack.
---
1. The RNG in this game is terrible. Expect disappointment and engage enemies accordingly.
---
2. If you're struggling to solo a Sheepsquatch, you need to reevaluate your build/tactics. Cripple both legs, and the SQ should go down easily.
---
All things except Melee, Heavies and Comando Rifles need a buff.
---
Oh god, I cannot convey how annoying the turrets having the eyesight of Mr. Magoo is. I have  a structure half dead before the turrets even realize something is smacking it. I have spotlights by every turret cluster too, cause I was told it helps, and it certainly doesn't.
---
But why do you say that the system isn’t changing? Are you happy with the loot you are getting from the SBG or Imposter?
---
The limit is literally there so you don't store up so many things at once. This gets suggested in some form every single day, and every single time it is not going to happen. If you have 300 lbs of garbage legendaries, then you play the game often enough that you shouldn't be picking up every 1* harpoon gun and broadsider you see
---
When you kill a legendary you're pulling the handle on a slot machine.  The # of *s give your the wheels that will spin.  Get 3 of a kind to winn a 3*.  Thanks for playing, try again
---
Sorry buddy, I dont see myself as a good guy, just made a mistake, its fine if I was proved wrong, and I wasnt crying just giving my view point, sorry you read it wrong.
---
Oh........
---
That's a relief, kind of. That char hasn't had a lot of script to try to get only weapons from her. So far I've tried 200 worth of mostly weapons but some armor and no shotguns.
---
I don't start it unless I'm going to run pylons. 
---
I'll join anyone else's (at least briefly) to see how it is going. If  I have the gear and aid on me I'll run pylons, if not I'll see what i can do. Trash is xp and that's mostly what I'm after so even if it isn't going to succeed ill kill trash for 10 minutes.
---
Still I see maybe 80% of these succeed.
---
Honestly, bloodied scares me, so I was planning on looking for anti-armor weapons. I hadn't really thought about which kind of heavy gun I'd want to use. I thought Batteries Included would be a good addition since it would allow me to stockpile Fusion Cores without losing a lot of carry weight to them. What perks would you suggest instead?
---
This is odd. I have merchants and A.T.H.E.N.A visit my camp regularly and they've never been fired on.
---
I'm excited for all of it but especially one wasteland. I've been getting bored going to all the same locations but this will make going anywhere on the map actually fun.
---
Yesssss. Please. Sofia I know you've been asleep for decades, but we still fucking close doors in the wasteland.
---
1. Put down a powered door.
---
2. Burn it down with a flamethrower.
---
3. Put a pressure plate where the door was.
---
4. Repair the door, connect to pressure plate.
---
Presto! You now have Star Trek doors in your camp and will no longer have to worry about people leaving the door open.
---
▪ No matter your build, go for these 8 perk cards as soon as possible ( https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;w=lm2au2at1ik0if2ii0iq2p10 ).
---
They are quality of life improovement and they are extremly necessary to make your endgame experience as smooth (pleasant) as possible. Content in the endgame (+lvl50) require you to be as self-sufficient as possible. Enemies are tougher, hit harder and activities can put you against real bulletsponges !
---
At this stage of the game, you really need to be ready. You must know how to mass craft ammo and repair your stuff efficiently. Because if once lvl 50 you focus only on polishing your build while you have none of these perk cards, trust me you will cry ! Everything will be too expencive to craft or repair, it will just be a messy grinding endgame experience for you ! 
---
You really want these perk cards before hitting lvl 50.
---
Focus on maxing these perk cards and your main weapon perk cards. They must be your priorities.
---
Also, go as soon as possible get the "Excavator" power armor plans ( a quick google research should get you on the good path ). 
---
Once lvl 45 you need to focus on building this baby so you can start farming some lead ore in the "Lucky hole Mine" ( another quick google research should get you on the good path )
---
And to finish, install your camp next an Acid deposit so you can place an Acid extractor on it ( once again, a quick google research on "resource deposits locations" should get you on the good path ). You'll need Acid to turn your lead ore into useable lead. 
---
Here the perk card "Super duper" will really be helpful...same when you'll be crafting ammo. The "Scrapper" perk card will allow you to take full advantage of weapon dismentling. You will never be out of steel for your ammo.
---
If you do it right, once lvl 50, polishing your build will be...smooth and easy. You'll have a pretty decent dps, no ammo issue and enough resource to fix your guns &amp; your armors ( as long as you don't stop scavanging and grabbing your loots ).
---
It was a copied/pasted text. This question is often asked, so i saved this text in a file.
---
There are still super rare plans and recipes out there though but yeah the majority of them are a waste of space. Would love to get my hands on a few plans for fasnacht doughnuts for example.
---
I'm going for Master infiltrator first as its value is front loaded. Then either Electric absorption or ammo factory. The rest feel underwhelming.
---
Put them in your vendor for the recommended price, they sell quick and you get quick cash. I agree legendary script need to have a higher daily limit, but you are just being a horder on a relatively easy resource to find.
---
That's some very impressive range.
---
Or some very shoddy seals on my suit.
---
I got a one star zealots tire iron from killing earl during an event 😑😑😑
---
Thanks for the suggestion. Im still new to heavy weapons and gonna try it out. When i get the mods for it.
---
This just in: don’t hoard in a hoarding game.
---
Lotta things to think about here so I'll try to adress them in order.
---
My thoughts on Chem Resistant was to be a sort of Junky's Starched Genes. Get the 5 least obstructive addictions and lock them in. Not yet sure if Brawling Chems will be the only chems I'll be using and I don't want extra addictions.
---
Planning to use power armor here so I don't believe backpack mods will be useful at all. If I'm wrong, though, I'll definitely take your advice on the GWT vs TH perks.
---
Bloody Mess is in the build.
---
Butcher's bounty is so I don't have to farm as much for specific meats (such as Mirelurks.) Never really know when I'll get run up on by a meaty boi out in the wild.
---
Fireproof is definitely something I'm looking at.
---
Bodyguards is one of the only defensive perks that work for a full health power armor build.
---
Does Grounded limit damage from Electrically Charged? I know it's not much, but extra damage is extra damage.
---
At such low Agility, I'm thinking Scaly Skin is a hard no. I'd also have to find room for even more Luck for Class Freak that way.
---
Definitely agree on the Instigating weapon. Got an Instigating SS+1S Groggy Axe already in use.
---
It won't. I playtested. Pistols are not in a great place. The other poster is right, it's time to switch to a commando build.
---
this. you should not take every item you find. i know its hard if you are hoarder.
---
While I got bored of the division 2 pretty fast, that does sound like a nice system. I've been playing Fallout 76 off and on since release (recently, I just came back a week ago with gf) and we have gotten -1- legendary worth using, and it's a 1 star. Only cause it's got the vampire quality and is a minigun so makes me immortal. Other than that one gun, out of the literal hundreds of legendaries we've gotten, they've all been crap like "does more dmg when you have less armor!"
---
That'd be weird (but totally on brand) for them to change it for everything else.
---
(If ot even was changed? I really don't know. Just something I heard.)
---
A lot of people asked for PvP public teams. Shame Bethesda didn't listen.
---
 It’ll probably be atom shop
---
Yh I agree with the water but when you go to the ash heap and see setterlers in shirts and slacks without a gas mask on it diesnt seem right now imagine those setterlers wearing old mining clothes like mole miner rags they got from killing them thats be really cool or in the cranberry bog u can see setterlers again normal clothes now again imagine those setterlers wearing high protective gear like a full reinforced hazmat suit exploring thatd would fit much better heck even in the grathton area people wearing special types of suits to avoid becoming gouls like the reinforced hazmat suit and the back story could be paige wanted people go set up outpost in the grathton area and they were getting I'll from rads so the people at foundation made the suits to explore hazardous areas
---
Honestly a good bloodied build is all about defensive perks, you want no more than 3 points into you damage cards, (get one level of each for a 30% boost over one level 3 card which only gives 20%)
---
Unyielding armour is a must in eyes. The stat boosts from low health directly affect the damage avoidance perks. 
---
Mutations are great from helping with making a tanky build, with strange in numbers and class freak active you hardly notice the downside to mutations anyway so get them all pretty much.
---
People still take workshops?🤔
---
I’m not counting console plebs in my analogy, but I don’t disagree that it should be an ingame option; I’m just pointing out that I get to have my white pip-boy since I play on a superior platform
---
I'm looking forward to possibly facing a challenge.. possibly.. just need to wean myself off magic shotguns first.. no wait! I just remembered turtle last night &amp; the supermutants with magic lasers 😂 ohh Beth you crack me up:P
---
You devious bastard......I love it
---
Are we talking about Nuclear Hide &amp; Seek?
---
But there's no Season on... Is anyone actually playing that?
---
Not sure? I know magazines and bobbles don't stack with themselves. Thought I heard somewhere that similar items dont stack same buffs anymore. So no stacking food damage with other food damage but chem damage with food damage was okay.
---
But I'd be happy for that to not be the case.
---
Steam and Bethesda.
---
Hahahaha ok thanks
---
There is someone selling them for 1500 on xbox and can't seem to sell mine
---
Loads. Only there is no revenge since I died to mobs and he just took what I dropped. I guess I wasn't clear enough on that
---
That’s great! I would love to play with you some day
---
Yes it’s hard fighting along side a level 800 something player but you do find the ones out there that help lower players with experience and tips and all kinds of things
---
If you try the Aa2525 out with your bloodied build on earl/sbq lmk what ya find.
---
I'm too much of a Ralph Wiggum to have an explosive weapon. This has been proven.
---
I'm still not eager to find out how much damage a lvl150+ suicidebomber eyebot do compared to the lvl1 (:
---
Can you provide a screen shot of your Ultracite Ammo listing when you open your tinker's workbench
---
Preach it man. Beth can we get this? I dont like this. I wont ever be happy with how the game is now until its tailored to MY specific wants/needs. Either play it and have fun or dont....but please stop b1tching.
---
Oh wow, after I read that whole comment I’m very nervous, this game look way too complicated hahaha
---
I like how people think they read Reddit at all.
---
Partly depends on which workshop. Every time I’ve taken the Ammo Factory or one of the power plants that produce fusion cores, someone with a strong PVP build shows up and kills me unless I see them coming and escape. With other workshops I get ganked very rarely, but with those it’s 100% certain a PVPer will show up.
---
I’ve found that PVPers are most likely to show up during the Defend events, when they can see you’re there and they’re more likely to get in a surprise attack because you’re busy fighting PVE.
---
I’m on XB1...YMMV on other platforms.
---
I think the game mechanic should be that if you own a workshop, someone can challenge for it and that gives you an option to contest or not. If you say no, they automatically get the workshop but they don’t get to PVP you.
---
Because I don’t like the mechanic and I don’t want to PVP, I avoid taking workshops except when required for caps challenges or SCORE. Then I take them, but leave as soon as I can and don’t ever defend them.
---
Well they got it, food and hunger will now only provide positive effects no negative in a future update. I just don't get it.
---
It's seemingly random
---
Yeah, I'm using an Instigating SS+1S Grog's Axe right now. Definitely sure I don't want to go bloodied with this build. I've got a bloodied heavy gunner in PA and a bloodied sneak commando already. Looking for something with full health for a change of pace. And if I went bloodied melee, I'd drop the PA completely and go unarmed.
---
The furniture in it is actually nice if you want that woodsy, rustic, "making do with what you find" vibe to the camp. For some aesthetics it fits better with the wasteland look than a lot of other stuff
---
That's ridickulous
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
I'm looking forward to Infiltrator and that Ammo crafting perk, so I don't have to change my build and spend so much time running around farming up mats for bullets.
---
Yeah. I am.
---
Where is this challenge tho? I checked every I think and there was a couple robot related, but I don't remember this one.
---
Edit: Nvm, found it. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm not gonna be able to kill 1k/weapontype robot in time, especially since I can't even move from all the 3\* legendaries on me from the sale.
---
People on the PTS have said it’s a breath of fresh air for the weaker areas of the map. Areas in the Forest and such now have correctly leveled enemies, so there’s more areas to farm XP. From what I’ve heard, unless you’re using a bloodied build, you’re looking at maybe one extra bullet to drop leveled enemies now.
---
I love how everyone has the choice of all these OP weapons. 
---
I look to my Instigating Fixer like that reliable girl who's the kind that won't turn heads but you can take home to meet mum.
---
Actually... For my woman on the side I pulled a two shot version from Mumbles with hectic Crit values, is that even good?
---
Thank you, I'm on PC, steam's linked, so it's maybe to do with that, that's really useful.
---
I'm stoked to be able to scrap all my extra cards so I can swap perks out faster with muuuuch less scrolling.
---
Scaling enemies sounds fantastic too; more challenge. Also more reasons to do the lower level events since you can get usable loot from them.
---
The legendary perks sounds pretty awesome, *especially* the stat cards for much greater flexibility in builds. With +5 from a fully upgraded perk you can just near fully specc 2 weapons. Or fit some nice QOL perks.
---
As for the damage recalculation, I'll still play what I like - my gunslinger, stealth sniper, and unarmed cannibal - and I'll just have to deal with it.
---
Or just play and enjoy it. It's a game. You're not putting a man on the moon.
---
I get what your saying and besthesda even confirmed it a long time ago saying that they were surprised that players didn't want to PvP.
---
The PvP issues are mostly related to the fallout brand being single player so all that fan base just hates PvP and will never allow it unless its completely out of sight.
---
You're silly. In video games seals are forever!
---
Been working for awhile....all I had to do was check urself.
---
And while you're at it keep the back display solid colour when you go camouflage. White is notoriously hard to see next to invisible...
---
it was a blessing, now I can’t use another pa haha it’s just too much fun to be able to move a wider range
---
Just move fallout76custom.ini out of the folder onto your desktop to turn the mods off and play NW.  Move it back into the folder to turn mods back on.
---
Building ufos is hard only place is whitesprings
---
It may be the only thing I'd spend money on
---
Yeh you need the gauss rifle prime receiver to be able to craft the ammo.
---
I have 2 builds complete and one that has a way to go but once it's done I'm going for the added specials in areas I currently can't apply some decent perks. My commando doesn't have the strength right now for blocker so that's going to be awesome cause that's what hurts me most.
---
there's [mods to make all sorts of stuff glow](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/categories/4/), including [ores](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/207)
---
All right, then. Thank you for the info.
---
U couldve checked the "recent" list and hope....or play on own server or with friends
---
True. He could be low-level tho.
---
I cant load into the game at all. I try to load into the game from the main menu and it just silently crashes to desktop. I cant even play the game at all.
---
If you didn't rejoin that same server of course it's not going to be there
---
&gt; I just want a place-able fast travel mat
---
They disabled that due to people making trap camps.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ipv5zi/is_getting_nuked_every_match_count_as_harassment/  
---
Good to see someone else in the same thought as me. Of course you won't get much support on this sub-reddit because people here are ANTI pvp and just shit on your thread even though they don't have pvp experience and therefore can't possibly understand what you are talking about.  
---
Best thing I can do is change my name every 3 months. Gives me a week of game-play where I can play my own way instead of having to always make sure I am on a clear running path and have gunrunner equipped.  
---
I think maybe they should allow you to be anonymous or change your username every 24-48 hours.  
---
I was invited to a discord a month ago, the group I was randomly teamed with was friendly so I did. A week or so in, OTHER people in the discord claimed I was a hacker because I killed their entire squad one match. They say, that because I outran the nuke 9/10 times, I am speed hacking. One even said they saw me flying around the map using those blatant style hacks! So now, every game I'm in, I have to deal with not just one sore loser, but a gang of them because they have a "hacker report" section in their discord.  
---
This is targeted harassment in my book.
---
am i too late ? :(
---
Awesome
---
Sadness
---
They don't have to it's a known bug
---
Not being an ass, but what would this help? It's a pretty common issue, just have to keep killing SBQ until you get the original gauss prime receiver.
---
 My advice is forget about it and it will come, if you keep doing the event hoping for that one drop you won't get it. That's what I did and deadset a few battles later I had it. May seem weird but I can't count how many times I've been looking for something in particular only to give up and find it while just roaming around.
---
Because these are the first new prime plans and I guess they just didn't add them either out of forgetfulness or to prevent the new Gauss plans from bugging the old one
---
Thats the part that sucks, having a game you enjoy get destroyed by the fan base just because they don't personally like it. Happens a lot in gaming today sadly. They just yell until the game changes or they shut it down not understanding that there were some gamers that enjoyed it and you just took that away. So much for a community, now days I dislike gamers overall. Not all just the majority.
---
Okay but like, if someone has everything unlocked and they're just minding their own business and sharing resources with the whole server? Just leave them alone dude. Some people can't get FO1st. 
---
And if you're showing up *just* to do PVP with an uninterested party? You're an asshole. There's literally a whole ass server of people you can shoot at to try and start PVP. If they aren't interested, move the fuck on.
---
Just like any other piece of attire well done
---
It's easier than any other fallout
---
For Meat Week, I generally run an Unarmed Non-stealth Junkie's build with bolstering armor with AP refresh and weapon weight reduction. I also run with Thru Hiker 3 and Good with Salt 3 and mostly my armored backpack. When I have downtime, I swap on Super Duper 3 and craft all the soups, meats, and prepared foods I can. Then, before each primal cut event, I take one of everything. I alternate between swing speed and power attack unarmed weapons and for the Alpha Predators I use an OP heavy weapon.
---
Doing all of this allows me to easily finish the events solo including the Cranberry Bog event and for the one in the mire I once completed it solo with 3:23 to spare.
---
Randomly, and has been that way for a long, long time.
---
Junkies is one of them, at least for the pump action, i also have a "magic" plasma 2 shot with a beam splitter
---
Awesome! My main character is a mothman convert so I can FINALLY deck out my camp. Rep my faction lol.
---
I hate that.
---
Really makes me question using two shotgun shells.
---
I don't know if they added it a year into the game or what, but I finally noticed an eerie bass-ey warble sound happen every 5-10 seconds in the mire. I guess it's supposed to be the sounds of the mire as a whole but I really don't know what it is.
---
Both are great, is just personal preference or the situation.
---
Explosive is gonna be useful in almost every situation, so I find it more useful for farming and doing events. But if you are fighting larger enemies like the SBQ or Earle, faster fire rate is the way to go.
---
Also, something I find really useful about explosive weapons is that they are great for tagging enemies. If I'm in an event with some other players, I can just shoot the ground and hit the enemies with the explosive area damage. Does barely any damage, but is more than enough to tag them and get the xp/loot, and I don't have to worry about oneshoting them by mistake.
---
It is still a broken mechanic.  I only take them for Challenges.  Had a guy contest and immediately 1 shot me before I even knew he was there.  I just ignore it and move on to another server.
---
I can tell in the first thirty seconds of an Encryptid fight if I'm wasting my time. I'll walk off if it's gonna be a wipe.
---
I don't get why activating three pilons is so damn hard. Yet here we are.
---
As it's been mentioned OP- if this is for Fixer plans just buy them. I bought mine (then the next Encryptid I did for shits and gigs I got another set as is the way).
---
Honestly I don't know why anyone would do it after getting the plans anyway. It's kinda shit with lousy rewards (other than more plans....).
---
Which is why I have such a high respect for modders who take time out of their lives to create content. Even for other Bethesda titles too
---
&gt;Nuke silos are filled with laser turrets that rapid fire low damage shots
---
Sir, even with Refractor 4 and T-51b, those lasers melt me because they refuse to fucking die half the time. I’ll have to sit there with a Super Sledge and hit them 10 times to kill them most of the time because their damage resistance is randomly through the fucking roof. Those “low damage” lasers are the bane of my existence in the silos.
---
You chose a bad time to get into the bloodied build 😂
---
No don't worry lol it's not gonna be that rough. It is just really anoying looking around for materials and it can occupy a big part of your time once lvl 50, if you aren't prepared. This is why i suggest to go for these perk cards first.
---
Alot of players will tell you that you need to make sure your build is fully optimised. The problem is that alot of perk cards become available at certain lvls. So you will be forced, several time, to pick perk cards you don't even need and it will add special point to your total special points used...to make short it will disrupt your progression at some point.
---
But before lvl 50 you will have some ammo issue and weapon management issue, i mean you may happen to play with a weapon lvl 20 while you are lvl 40...you may even end up to use weapons that you aren't even spec for. Over focusing on your build isn't a great idea at the beginning. You will mostly go with the gun you have ammo for...
---
Just focus on getting to good quality of life perk cards so once lvl50 you have all you need to actually polish your build and get the good perk cards. Some activities at this lvl can require alot of ammo. You wanna be ready for this 😉✌
---
They also said Vaults were the future once the Great War hits so... lol
---
People put hundreds of hours into the game, yet Bethesda can’t do anything right lmao
---
That didn't stop trap camps alas.
---
I can see this. Like the New Vegas project but it would be called The Great Appalachia or something
---
Merge the two games? That sounds interesting actually
---
I claim them when I want fusion cores and I’ve had guys on there own kill me and I laugh because I wasn’t paying attention I’ve had groups come in and kill me it’s basically the Wild West and in favor for the challenger
---
It stopped because season 1 is over with.
---
Season 2 will begin Sept 15th with the One Wasteland/update 22 patch.
---
**[The brotherhood will not forget your contribution]**
---
No I'm on pc sadly
---
I usually collect ore.  Then I deposit it straight away for better mobs and better drops...I know it’s rng, but there seems to be more legendary floaters, snallygasters and deathclaws than normal ghouls.
---
Unless there aren’t many of us...then I can’t trust people to keep the ghouls at bay.  (Magic shotgun makes keeping my side clean easy).
---
If no one else comes I will cripple the ghouls on my side and do a run just on my side...and hope someone on the other side does the same so we can get at least a level one reward.
---
The season ended on Tuesday so theres no point doing the challenges right now. Next season starts on the 15th.
---
0 rare.
---
I'm a "Tank" and I have full Vanguards with some damage reduction perks and  flame/poison/rad resist too. I like it. No PA.
---
Really?
---
Unfortunately from what I can tell people apparently don't think this will help. So much for positive changes, if most are okay with the state of the game or have no faith in Bethesda to do something like this then idk what these people want 🤷‍♂️
---
3 cores is a bunch?
---
Try this:

---
Why you downvote I was just telling my experience
---
Ah. That explains a lot. Now I'm sad, I really wanted that wallpaper :(
---
I remember once getting myself hyped about using a Zealot's Fat Man with all the appropriate perks on and I lined up my shot at the SBQ, pulled the trigger, heard the unmistakable whistling sound of the projectile, saw the resulting mushroom cloud pop up with bright flashes of fire and then the damage number popped up. It hit for 1 damage :-|
---
I more just wince when I see people swapping around PA with every skin imaginable.... Oh Lord the money they must have spent.... *That's* a flash of wealth imo.
---
..... Or silliness. I dunno.
---
Meanwhile I'm rockin full Possum Scout. Pompy or whatever his name is says my parents must be proud. They definitely are.
---
So if people are caught in the middle of nowhere and need to free up space they can choose to drop the weapon.
---
That's where deciding Energy vs. Balistic makes a difference. If you use something like a minigun, you won't need batteries included on top of a maxed out power user. Those cores will last a long time.
---
I'd also agree with the other comment on reducing perception for a strength build. If you take the grounded serum then you will get +150 energy resistance (but again you wouldn't want to do this if you are going to use an energy weapon, as it will cause you to lose damage with it as well).
---
Here's a rough take on one way you could start this (assuming not an energy build):
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f378b48&amp;d=s52ss2si2se2sj2c72cu2l71lt2lu2i44ih2id2a00cr0e00eh2p10p80pa0eo2a72&amp;w=s32sq2sr2s82sg2](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f378b48&amp;d=s52ss2si2se2sj2c72cu2l71lt2lu2i44ih2id2a00cr0e00eh2p10p80pa0eo2a72&amp;w=s32sq2sr2s82sg2)
---
You could argue reducing fireproof and adamantium skeleton a couple stars and moving those points to agility. Having good AP is pretty important for melee. 
---
Another option is boosting up intelligence and adding stabilized which will greatly help your gunner build, but then those points are essentially wasted when you're running melee. One benefit of maxing out INT at a lower level though, is that you'll gain experience quicker - so something to keep in mind.
---
Sadly yeah. I’ve gotten 2 so far and I think a cursed pickaxe or 3.
---
Ssd. Load times are small, if there is a lot of meat piles then it still fucks up but it makes a nice difference.
---
I just move my camp so it all goes into storage and I buildo off items I need and scrap the rest.
---
Brotherhood of steel Robes for scribes and elders want and need them so bad it’s the true bos not the fallout 4 maxson copy paste to taggerdy thunder failure
---
Script gun
---
Incisor is a whopping 75% armor penetration and is better than Master Slugger (for that matter so is Martial Artist in sustained dps situations). Run 3/2/1 in the damage perks for 5% more damage than just dropping Master Slugger.
---
I've pulled about 20 in my 100 runs or so, not rare good scrip though
---
My guess is because you can hold several at a time. So if you needed to claim one (for a challenge or whatever) but they were all taken already, than you could still do so.
---
I see them for sale all the time in player vendors, (usually when I'm trying to find a certain *other* extraordinarily rare and extremely expensive plan that I've been looking for for ages and still never found, lol).
---
How do you know they were the ones to downvote?
---
Ah I see. There are few games I go sneak around in so I'd have to play with it to get used to it. 
---
Plus coming from a HG PA build who could give a fuck about sneak is definitely different lol
---
Not yet, it’s first come first serve kind of thing. I have one unreserved plan that you can claim if you’re first
---
Hah
---
Wrong bug mate.
---
They cant complain really the game tells you the risk, its up to the player whether they believe that extra junk is worth it, you are sharing the map with other players so it don't give exclusive rights to workshops
---
Well congratulations on being in the minority of players who feel that way. Now if you don’t mind answering the real question, why shouldn’t the system change?
---
Although it sucks, you didn't miss out on "a bunch of fusion cores."  You missed out on 3 since that's the max it holds.
---
If you are ever farming and don't want to lose your work, join a public team. If the game crashes, when you restart it, you'll have the option to rejoin your team.
---
Since you weren't on a public team, you can still go to the "recent" tab and just start adding people further down the list, hoping that they were on that server and haven't left.  Maybe you'll they lucky and they'll accept the friend request.  But if you just had one energy plant, it's really not worth it.
---
You may already be aware but I believe relocating your CAMP module will change spawn location. You don't have to move your camp just the module thing. 
---
It's possible that you can manipulate it into a spot that'll give you a couple more desirable spawn locations. I did it for my camp on top of Seneca - my spawns are now inside the mountain, or on the backside foundation.
---
As a bloodied heavy gunner pa user its a god send now can jetpack and use protocols
---
I was imagining furious bluegrass and 60’s organ stuff so yeah that would be great. *Sidenote: if the mole miner in the basement is you and you are being kept against your will, blink twice.*
---
The game already does a pretty good job of stopping griefers on ps4. Not sure how it is on pc. I’m not big on griefing but I’ve taken out people giving me crap. 
---
Workshops are fair game though. When you claim one, you know what can happen so you can’t complain. Personally I think the game needs more tension to feel like a real survival game.
---
Dying comes as part of the package, unfortunately.
---
That said, it's not too difficult to stay alive in 90% of cases. But in that remaining 10% you are usually 1-shotted by some bullshittery that you can't do anything about, like a legendary robot exploding on death etc.
---
You on Xbox? As I don’t know if I can or not but if you’re I can join a team and maybe I can put wallpaper up for you
---
I was tempted for that alone, but there is a halloween one. Sure it has bat smoke, but I think I'd rather wait for that one.
---
Build there, blueprint then place elsewhere!
---
Not everyone can be as bad ass as you.
---
There are a lot of current options. I’d always be glad to see more, though.
---
I've had the same problem: my camp founded onto close-to-the-edge-of-the-cliff-but-good-vista mountan place, but teleportation had been leaving me far, far below the lights of my home. So i've just moved my camp "thingy" 10 feet away from the appearing spot and it worked perfectly — no more second fast traveling. Try to move C.A.M.P. around and check fast travel every time you do that.
---
ps4
---
One shotting a level 100 super mutant? Challenge accepted. I'm thinking one of the following methods (assuming optimized build for each):
---
* Instigating +40% Power Attack Super Sledge (non-stealth, using power attack ofc)
---
* Stealthy unyielding unarmed instigating power attack
---
* Magic shotgun in vats, stealth may be needed
---
* Mayyybe a critical hit with a TSE Dragon or with a JE Harpoon Gun
---
They returned the doubling of walls, so you can "paint" the interior walls, but it would be great to be able to paint the outside.
---
You can’t add Atomic Shop items/skin to other people’s camps. The items from the Season count as well.
---
It’s a neat gun but it is just good to scrip. I have all weapons and all plans. Only got the mask once which I love the mask. This morning joined a server and got to earl but once I finally loaded in I made down the shaft right before they killed him so no loot. But whatever I got about 100 screws from just a minute down there
---
It works perfectly
---
Glassed cavern isn't bad but highly boring after a while. You go in and there will be some ultracite ore things on the ground a little ways down. If you click on one and it doesn't go away enemies will continue to spawn in waves every time you click on one. But you have to clear the whole wave before more will spawn.
---
Completely agree. I think they thought at first there was gonna be a ton of pvp.  I was talking to the other guy who just commented that I don’t understand his point.
---
Once it shows as a public event go inside and talk to the head robot. This starts the event
---
Yes. I found that method, I'm very glad there's a permanent fix coming &lt;3
---
Makes sense! I think you’re doing it right with focusing on a single build. My PA character is bloodied two handed but also because I’m trying to balance having a heavy gun option. Feels like maintaining heavy gun with an unarmed bloodied wouldn’t be easy or even doable. Unarmed bloodied sounds like a ton of fun though..
---
Collectables never stacked. Most chems don't stack. Foodbuffs stack just fine.
---
Just tested foodbuffs on encrypted. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/poknpvu)
---
If someone trust me enough to just hand me something,? there is no way I would become that guy and make the guys game life miserable. So far I have seen a lot of very nice players in FO76. Except for the little PVP squeekers running around just blowing everything up.
---
If you don't mind me asking, what do you enjoy about it?
---
For me, it's one of the weaker events in the game. And the reward drop pool has nothing interesting in it, other than standard Savage Divide loot. (I suppose you can potentially get yourself a Whitesprings jumpsuit, but if you wear a backpack it just looks like a regular jumpsuit because the logo is covered up.)
---
Fallout 76 don‘t need any PvP, it needs much Coop stuff 👍
---
There are other Games where PvP makes more Sense 👌
---
Don't be sorry just want to know what it means LOL
---
Yeah if it’s his first time and doing it without glitching I can def see a hour. I just now started using the jet pack wall glitch but before that it def took a decent amount of time. Shit prob the first time I ran one it prob took over a hour
---
Early on the plan was much harder to obtain, harder than intended. I actually had to start a third character, level her up just enough, and bought the plan from the Watoga vendor bot. I actually bought several and made a tidy profit selling the extras for 5,000 caps. AFAIK, the plan is easier to obtain now but you might still find someone who will buy it at a markup.
---
I thought miniguns were pretty op, even the less desired ones... What it lacks in damage, it makes up for in RoF. That's why the gatling gun does more damage but slower to fire. It's balance, even if its not accurate irl.
---
It's random but you can get legendaries of known plans, like the fixer, secret service armor, plasma caster, and other weapons and armor.
---
I've gotten a couple of useless plasma casters and a piece of secret service armor that I can remember over the last few weeks.
---
wheres the chest ?
---
I think you’ll find that a build oriented around one handed melee is never going to be that satisfying because damage is low. Even without perks, you’d probably do better with your BE Handmade. 
---
Unarmed does the most damage, and gives you room for blocker and barbarian. Two handed does less damage than unarmed, but let’s you wear PA.
---
I’d recommend full health unarmed. Get an Instigating weapon, mix and match armor, talons and twisted muscles.
---
Some perks you’re missing:
---
Fireproof (or dense torso), protects from SB sonic attack.
---
Action Person, adrenaline, serendipity, ricochet, class freak, nerd rage
---
Still kind of trying to figure the entire game out. But I have no idea whats valuable and whats not. I scrape most everything and throw it in my scraper.
---
In a room near the exit
---
People don’t seem to comprehend that you need to activate the pylons and just unload on it cloaked and I have better things to do than run around wasting stimpaks.
---
I’ll show up but I’m not sticking around if people can’t figure out which way is up.
---
I dropped mine

I'm with you on that feeling like you had to log in or fall behind thing. But I really think they learned a bit from the 1st season. I saw they were going to add some more weekly challenges, which should help shift the "weight" of challenges to be a little more casual friendly
---
It was the first comment so I'd assume so
---
Damn
---
I'll be on in 10 mins maybe you should come have a look at my VM..
---
Ign.... +SampleR-
---
Are there any in particular that are rare
---
O is that the locked door on left when you go in ? it only opens when you beat boss ?
---
Yea
---
You got wrecked by NOOBS lol!
---
This isnt a hoarding game
---
Lmao i don't care about your opinion on player console.
---
It's an issue to not having this option in game, especially for colorblind people.
---
I see players tank damage and I get one tapped. Smashing the stims during an event works most of the time for me,I need to tweak some things I think lol
---
its not rare at all.  but its a good 40 scrip becaude it weighs less than a pound
---
Why even bother posting? Just drop the shit you don’t need
---
It won't stop the existence of trap camps but it'll stop most players from being caught up in one as soon they Fast-Travel in.
---
I just looked and prices were crazy for the pc versions but seems like there were hundreds for ps4 and xbox versions, plus I have no idea what I am looking at anyway.
---
I always have my light footed perk on when going camp shopping.
---
Specials and ammo factory. What rads, follow through, and infiltration will probably get mixed in.
---
I was planning on leveling up some alts so that I could spread some of the legendaries ive collected around and I though that hitting 50 would unlock more legendary slots but it sounds like you have to unlock them on one profile so I’m probably gonna grind the shit out of my main.
---
Infiltration will take a back seat to just switching out cards, same with what rads. Follow through would be handy but definitely tertiary. I’ll probably hit strength, agility, intelligence and when I hit 200 I’ll go ammo factory since I’m just gonna be grinding experience which means I’m gonna need a shitload of ammo for events.
---
I wonder if you can have both built at once since it's two different machines? There's a limit of 1 for the mothman machine.
---
I’m stressing mane cause I’m dealing with the same garbage today and I’ve restarted the quest 4 times already, no keycard reader... I don’t have the mf ressources  to keep fighting this assaultron over and over.
---
why are you not running maxed Blocker?
---
ignoring 45% incoming melee damage is huge in this game.. especially for melee builds.. youre in mobs faces constantly
---
I have 3 lvl 100+ characters that may suck after update, and if so I'm out.
---
Not being an ass, but what would this help? Bethesda doesn't know what you're thinking, so forgetting about it literally doesn't change what is dropped.
---
I’m not on PC
---
Not crashed once, he's bugged into the ceiling a couple of times and the sound isn't always synced but apart from that all good.
---
That'd be nice. I like the brotherhood engineer outfit + welding helmet but hate that the tank just sticks out the top of my backpack.
---
the next huge community meltdown when they get fixed.. thats what...
---
Haha, yeah it's hard to melee those suckers when they just ignore half our hits. I just ran thru a silo with a Vampire's super sledge, and while it didn't help me kill things it was nice to take a negative amount of damage from them.
---
Instigating actually isn't terrible. Unlike most other prefixes, Instigating will be unaffected by the damage nerf. It's always going to deal double damage on that first hit regardless.
---
Search "Magic Weapons Angry Turtle" on YouTube - best source of information about Magic Weapons
---
Yup, just realized I’m hurting myself bad for not running those cards.
---
Starting to think now I’ll get the chemist backpack, remove strong back completely, and drop a point on each of the sluggers to add maxed out incisor, blocker, and martial artist.
---
Will swap hard bargain for maxed tenderizer, might drop portable power and a point off nerd rage and move that over to charisma to improve lone wonderer and bodyguards, and hopefully have enough legendary perk points to add onto agility for demo expert.
---
Man I can’t wait for perk loadouts..
---
Ps4 pro. Never had a single issue.
---
It’s something that all of a sudden everyone noticed and now wants
---
I've had a single crash the first day it was added - while I've experienced a few bugs here and there since- no disconnects thankfully.
---
Nice I havnt ties out the vanguards yet
---
New run begins in 2 days. You'll have new stuff to chase!
---
I haven't seen anything official, but they've brought back the other events, no reason not to bring this back.   I'm looking forward to it.
---
You're right. I haven't invested to much into the nerfing as I never min-max'd anyways. I guess the ol girl will be hanging around a bit longer!
---
Post up on the other Reddit site that allows trading and someone will sort you out or sell you one
---
I’d be fine if they fixed the most glaring issues first and just picked away at smaller, much more minor bugs. The users here are right in that the game will never be fully polished so I think the best Bethesda can do is just fix as many important bugs as feasibly possible and then drop content.
---
Dont get to excited glitches, bugs, dupes and all that boutta be coming
---
And pip boy
---
New player myself and I'm stuck. Very disappointing 😕
---
Whitesprings has 'Enclave' written all over it.
---
They're gonna take it back, and with all the Sentrybots and other subtle ordnance be a total force.
---
I can't wait to see the bunker staffed with human members. Gonna be epic.
---
idgaf about color blind people.
---
I did it about 10 times in public,all wins ,all perfect.
---
*It will be best if you didn’t... resist, citizen. Your reinforcements are too far away to help you.  Just accept your... fate.*
---
“Ah I’m ten pounds over encumbered, let me drop my B2525 Fixer so I can fast travel out of this place.”
---
You wouldn’t put a skin on a weapon in the first place if you didn’t intend to keep it.
---
I hope your grandmother gets slapped by a deathclaw.
---
I wish ores gave XP when depositing them, or the event completion XP was increased based on how many you deposited, just to make up for the missed kills from playing the objective.
---
Personally looking forward to the ammo factory perk. Hopefully I won't have to stop what I'm doing to make more ammo every three trips outside my camp. The curse of a heavy gunner.
---
That awesome. Thank you for helping out that level 8 and level 9. I am sure that if you were not there, they would have probably gotten discouraged from the game and probably stopped playing. Since you helped them out, they most likely realized that not everyone is an asshole in this game (just a few people like myself).
---
On a side note though: Your story was good, but it really could have used more topless women and explosions. It might be good to incorporate more of that for future storytimes :)
---
Then they wouldn’t sell as much backpack skins😂😂
---
I have an instigating + power attack dmg Powerfist, and it 1-hits everything in the game excluding bosses.
---
Not even a bloodied weapon, and it's ridiculously OP.
---
Be interesting to see how it performs after the patch though, as I'm told they still haven't fixed/buffed the very low damage that unarmed weapons have been reduced to.
---
Hopefully the "nerf" (formula change) is step 1 in balancing weapons between class (heavy v. Auto rifle v. Pistol, etc)  and balancing within the same class ( handmade v AR, single action revolver v .44)
---
Have you tried the market reddits?
---
Not a new game, but you have to to load a save game from before you make the "point of no return" decision.
---
Well want to feel invincible while dishing out damage then a bloody build using PA with emergency protocols, dodgy, ricochet and things like that. Love that carry weight and huge xp gains unyielding thus a bloodied or vamp weapons.   
---
Prefer to feel "safe" go PA or vanguards full health, you choice of weapon, personally instead of junkies I go executioners on my full health PA but I use junkies on my vanguard.   
---
Just want to play well to play and not worry? Grab a full set of excavator and use whatever you want you don't have to be a damage god, just know you will be farming more.   
---
Gunslinger is fun and provides a challenge kind of, unless you get a glitched .44 with 400 range and extra base damage then it is a cake walk even being a level 5 gun. 
---
Also I am a fan of QoL perks over min/max so for weapon perks I only take 1 star of each tier as you get 30% for 3 compared to that extra 30% for 6 more.
---
"no, they're saying Boo-urns" Pete Hines to Todd, probably.
---
How about we just stop posting this. Seems like alot of the stuff here has been posted 100+ times already
---
LMAO this isn't a hoarding game. It's an online game. You are severely limited by camp budget, stash capacity, inventory weight, game performance, unoptimized menus, and shitty 3rd party servers. They only recently started letting you keep as much junk as you want if you pay a monthly subscription
---
Miniguns are great for dps, but they chew through ammo. They're also incredibly accurate for their rate of fire. Go with the high speed barrel instead of the high damage one. The stagger is a pain, can't argue with that. Plus magic miniguns are incredibly common, if that's your thing. And a Two Shot minigun is disturbingly effective.
---
Ya we get it. 1 star from a 3 star......
---
That wasn’t the question. 
---
Here’s the answer. It’s not my answer. But it’s the answer.
---
Video games of this nature are built on getting players to replay content over and over until they get what they want from that content. 
---
They can never ever put out enough content at any given time to keep a players attention on a game. Players will always consume faster than it can be created.
---
The system they use for generating legendaries plays into that. You’re always going to get way more legendaries you can’t use. 
---
Which is why the daily scrip limit probably won’t go up any time soon. But eventually will. Probably marginally like 200 a day. 
---
I don’t play to get legendaries. I don’t play for gear in general. It’s a sure fire way to get frustrated with any game.
---
But it’s how a big majority of games of this nature keep you playing.
---
They could just sell an invisible backpack skin for 2000 Atoms or something.
---
Purveyor rolls are only really good in the narrow gap between level 45/50 and ~100 or so. The upper cap depends on how long it takes you to find or buy decent 1* or 2* gear for your build. The rest of the time, you're just throwing scrip into the void for 3* rolls and hoping to somehow end up with a god roll out of it
---
I think we have a good variety of ragged,tuxedo,costumes,and survival outfits. The last ones,the survivals are a huge hit with the 2 from the moleminers event. My favourite is the caravan trader from the atom shop: that shaxx like fur is too good.
---
There is no minimum range, in my experience.
---
I'll take it, the last fixer plan
---
I like to think that he actually has a way out of there,  and thats the entrance to some Mole Miner city. I guess they dig through rock, so he could escape, I guess?
---
No idea, I can't say that I've seen 2 in one camp. I saw the Halloween one earlier in someons camp and had to double the check the bundle.
---
I haven't actually checked eyebots in the PTS, but I think the suiciders are still exclusive to the ISS fight. There, they might pose a threat, elsewhere they should be easy pickings
---
Survival shortcut is low key OP af
---
This seems like a question for the market subreddits; im sure they could help you!
---
Bloodied Heavy guns are quite op man, sorry but you may never see a buff happening there...
---
😕
---
You'd think people would get the hint by now that bethesda isn't interested in funding the appropriate wages of competent, skilled developers. now buy the cosmetics or Todd will be sad (and poor) and not be able to get disproportionate profit from porting Skyrim to something else.
---
I hope the author of fallout 76 ini tweak add an option like that to swap these file with the mods manager in it
---
Alas not because all they have to do is trap the 5 spawn points that the game auto assigns!
---
I'm a bloody heeavy weapon user and I will only break out PA for nuke zones, Earl, and mining lead. I run around in full unyielding armour just fine. I have a Vampire's Gatling Laser for times when I'm taking insane damage and I have to tank it. Works just fine
---
Edit: wanted to add I only use Excavator PA due to carrying so much crap I need that extra 100 weight bonus on top of 2 calibrated shocks.
---
I'm not quite to my 4th slot yet on my unarmed character, but for my current 3, I'll be doing Taking One for the Team, Legendary Agility (currently at 13, but I'll move 3 points out to another stat as I level up the perk to max it at 15), and probably Legendary Endurance too, to squeeze in Ironclad and Adamantium Skeleton. Eventually I'll most likely take Charisma and Intelligence, and probably What Rads for that constant rad removal.
---
On my sniper's 3 slots, probably Ammo Factory, Follow Through, and Master Infiltrator. Then Legendary Charisma, Endurance, and then either Luck or Strength.
---
Yh I liked the outfit too
---
They just re did a ton of places on the map with wastelanders.
---
I have all the gear and perks to face tank any damage from the ISS. I usually use a Vampire's Cryolater at the same time and my health barely moves. The problem then can be getting people to activate the pylons.
---
Alternatively, I use power armor with the medic pump and a Vampire's heavy weapon which is how I soloed it once before.
---
I got lucky and found out that a piece of forest scout armor I had turned my shotguns magic. Then I found someone selling a heavy combat armor piece that did it. Perfect. For a long time I used shotguns straight up since I don't have any magic ones. It's kinda nice not having to be killed by a charred ghoul for the 100th time cause they hit me like a truck.
---
I head that. I went started a heavy gun build after running a sneak commando since launch. It’s a huge adjustment going from bein sneaky to goin ham with a minigun.
---
I now want a Hitler outfit
---
I'm apparently an idiot. I just realized you don't actually have to block for Blocker to work. I'll be fixing that one immediately. Thanks for pointing it out! :)
---
if you are in a group  when you crash, you will likely come back in the same server. (public team also works)
---
I can't wait for legendary perks and the ops. Playing with my raid team again will be a blast....when my stupid job allows it.
---
2 crashes in 35+ events. Pretty low for me.
---
Well , problem solved than :D
---
Yeah if its a 3* enemy, i better get a 3* useless knife or pipe or handyman blade
---
I know lol, it happens irl too tho
---
Id rather have more ghouls there. the golf club used to be crawling with ghouls.
---
I’m 100% for this.
---
I got confused with the X and S. I must have been thinking about the Series X when I typed it. I corrected my brain fart. How embarrassing.
---
If you can, use comms to tell the enemy player that you need it for a challenge and you can have it next
---
Thanks makes sense!
---
I like to time the jump button to the landing and do the same thing.
---
I have also spent a lot of time on the sheepsquatch event with no luck.
---
I thought they said One Wasteland wasn't coming yet?
---
&gt;Not like their entire game is based off that model
---
Did you forget a /s for that?
---
Their entire game is built off that model.  Daily/weekly and now seasonal limits are in place on multiple levels to keep you playing. 
---
Poor drop rates tie into that layered approach of devaluing your time played.
---
Just make foundations "infinite" in their depth and have the top snap to the side every couple feet. They also need to add stairs that don't need to use up a whole tile.
---
Respect
---
Lol, true. Guess that was “a few”.
---
What do you think my little BoS protectron would have to say about all this?
---
For a riflemen build,from what I know...it’s a smart way to go!
---
Granted,I ain’t the end all,beat all,know it all type either...
---
That being said,Lever action &amp; Riflemen perks are a great marriage.
---
What’s yer platform yo?
---
Edit:to actually answer yer post,the only way to get a particular roll,Is market/vendor life...
---
Can’t rely on RNG,although she “may” favor ya...
---
Ya really never know
---
That would end poorly for the deathclaw. Nana fought the Red Army, I doubt a deathclaw would make her even break a sweat.
---
Okay.
---
Yep, you're correct it was 400, then 600, then 800.
---
Fingers crossed we get 1,000 one day, and even better... C.A.M.P budget increase.
---
Add The Deliverer.
---
Who are you and how do you know who those VertiBots belong to?
---
If you're on PS4, add PSN xa0t1ca (middle o is a zero) and send me a message reminding me. I have a legendary lever action rifle that I can set aside for you. Theoretically it is a fairly high cap value that you probably don't have yet, but we can work something out ;)
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7lqQXufKYGP9JJNV8SWPyR/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-daily-ops-preview
---
There's nothing about it here.
---
Did not know about this, but I can tell you it doesn't work on a furious minigun with exploding bullets and 15% faster reload.  Even with a fire rate of 209. Just tried
---
correct, but even that is getting old now.  I wish they could add bug free new content or at least fix the bugs.  Tuesday's patch is a step in the right direction, but it's been 2 years, we should have way more end game content to retain players.   The daily limits kill my enthusiasm when I know i'll be logging in and scripping for the next 2-3 weeks to clear my current stuff. I'll pick up another 2 weeks worth of stuff if I play even a little bit in that time.  It just a never ending boring cycle.
---
I don't know the numbers well, but I haven't stacked a million perks for damage (as in, not bloodied so all the adrenal, nerd rage etc) so I do wonder if I'll even see much of a damage drop anyways. Plus add follow through as a stealth build and I think I may even hit slightly above what I do now.
---
I don't know F76 nerfs (been playing 12 months or so) but I know ESO ones, and PTS isn't 100% binding. We are really gonna have to wait and see.
---
I dont claim work shops on the public server to often but I've never had an issue. Last night though a guy came into one I had claimed and he actually apologized and left. I should've bought something from his vendor or some kinda nice gesture but I was to busy trying to hurry up and equip my Pa and get the legacy out lol. I was all like oh shit u want some beef and next thing I know hes all like super cool lol.
---
Could you do that?
---
My [slugger/commando](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=ff53b25&amp;d=pg2ph2pp2sm2s42ss2ee2ic4lt2i12pi2pr2se2a01s12eh0l71sb2c81&amp;w=sn2&amp;m=cf8h&amp;wp=w2&amp;wm=1b2133&amp;ad=0478a&amp;n=Swinging%20Commando) is full time power armor so he's stuck with traveling pharmacy :/ I did find though that makeshift warrior really isn't necessary as long as you have weapon artisan, so that might save you a point or two.
---
Are you on xbone?
---
You can save up a bunch of caps and vendor hop, not everyone will run a rifleman build and some will put their lever actions in their vending machine for caps.
---
When you gamble at murmrgh’s you may want to try 2 star now since you’re looking for a weapon for your own use and 2 star gives you a lot more roll chances than 3. 
---
Or you can try the market sub and see if someone would sell/trade with you, you need to get some caps ready or some good legendaries that you won’t use, such as commando weapons and heavy guns.
---
Ooo😂😂thats a good idea didn’t think of that one.
---
If you're using PC, you'll be on with Steam and Bethesda launcher people (PC)  
---
If you're using Xbox then you'll be on with Xbox players.
---
Oh alright. I'll be on a little bit late but if you're still up I'll look.
---
Not if locked doors are locked to settlers too
---
Yeah that's fair
---
As a fellow parrot owner, if you're on PS4, I'll hook you up with a legendary lever or 2.
---
I think they should do specific junk handins like the BOS event for rep.
---
I see you too have tried building on seneca rocks
---
The hoarding crowd is really coming for the comments on this post.
---
Oh god I can see them already.  
---
Maybe we should call up the army now to prepare for the upcoming flood of tears
---
I mean technically shotguns don't need a buff but only because of the magic glitch. It comes to something that a shotgun has to be broken to actually be viable
---
Just figured there would be a “sorry we kicked you off, we’ll add you back to where you were” option.
---
In all seriousness, yeah I’d agree. I would assume they have a tunnel network to haul all that product. They have so much random stuff in the basement one would have to assume they can go anywhere in WV.
---
I normally switch off between rifles (handmade, .308 sniper, sub machine gun) during normal run and gun situations but if I’m going up against a hard boss or I know there will be a ton of enemies I’ll use a mini gun or laser Gatling.
---
Yes. It. Is. I will no longer need food or water.
---
While the faction grind is long (60 days?), the gold grind is even worse.  You really don't want to part with any of it.
---
I wouldnt mind dedicated rp servers for example
---
My bad, I’m lvl 49 doing it solo for the first time with glitching power armor.
---
This has been happening to me too, even still at lvl 55. I get picked on, and idk if it's bc I'm a girl or what. I'm not that great, I just play for fun. It's sad that people do this, and my thinking on it is that they get bullied in real life. 🙄
---
It certainly used to be a lot worse than it is now, back when someone claiming your workshop meant they could kill you anyway on the map.  
---
There was a couple times I was in my CAMP, someone would come in, look at me, then suddenly im hostile with them because their team mate is claiming my workshop and they just insta kill me, I dont miss those days at all
---
If you have a piece of armor with Reduce Damage while blocking x%. It'll turn any shotgun magical in VATS. Meaning all pullets hit and something goes funny with the damage calculations.
---
You could always check Bethesda's website to keep up-to-date on when things are beginning and ending to save yourself the disappointment and confusion.
---
No, I just assumed it was obvious enough that it didn't need one. I hold a very low view of the average person here but not *THAT* low
---
In case you're curious, the eyebombs at the ISS fight only scale up to 50 and the gutsies/protectrons up to 60. A dense chest piece should be fine for it
---
Deals 30% of damage to Earl gets 1 star armor
---
Do you have Game Pass? If not, I’d say maximize your Xbox Live time (36 months max) and pay $1 to upgrade your live subscription to Xbox game pass ultimate. If that still works - you should check.
---
Since this game is part of the subscription, and with the amount of updates made this year, I too decided to come back.
---
Xbox over here but how do you get the plans for the fixer?
---
Some weapon effects, used to be deemed trash tier, such as bashing and limb damage, can cause some high rof weapons to do more damage than ‘intended’, thus they’re called magic, because nobody would want a bashing heavy gun under normal circumstances. If lucky they can take out bosses quickly, but it’s really a hit and miss most of the time.
---
It better. There'll be a lot of upset folks if they don't run it. I'm hoping they put the empty pumpkin rack in the files this time.
---
Or like, more quest lines. Revolving dailies. This would add depth and activity to wastelanders, Beth can write awesome mini storylines, we've seen it. This would also help combat the malaise that many players complain about.
---
Sorry, this was somewhat tangential to OP's suggestion.
---
Get a set of troubeshooters armour, any kind just as long as its troubleshooters, the full set gives you like 75% protection against everything the silos can throw at you
---
Ohh I agree.  I Feel bad for Bethesda, they don’t make the decisions , zenimax accountants do . Game studios have very little control over their IP these days. All about the black snd fuck it if they want to caterer to their fan base . This game has slot of lost potential . It’s a shame. They have me though , I like camp building and that’s why I play.
---
The well plan from the settlers? That one is not tradable I'm afraid and you will have to buy with gold bullions.
---
Edit: And, just letting you know, all the plans you're asking for amount to quite a bit more in value than the handmade and ammo you're offering, and that might be why you're not getting any responses on the market sub.
---
Yeah I have an instigating/power attack DGC and I'm hoping I can still plow into super mutants sprinting at mach 10 and instakill it, cuz that is really satisfying.
---
Its weird because in most games I play the sneaky sniper character, but when you offer me PA I turn into a heavy lol
---
I like building my camps on cliffs so its flat. My current one Is north of silo alpha so o get to see nukes launching it's great.
---
I have been collecting AA , Junkies, Quad, and TSE weapons along with the gazillion bloodied I have.  I have explosive of almost everything. So whatever happens I’m gonna be alright.
---
&gt;I think it would be VERY beneficial for Fallout 76 to have a 6 month or even year 3 be all about fixing the game.  
---
I would just quit, no way am I waiting 6 month for new content again, definately not waiting a year, not a chance, and after taking a year off the game I wont want to come back, it'll get uninstalled and that'll be that and Im sure most people would think the same thing.  
---
Like I get it that the bugs we have are annoying, but not being able to fast travel the first time 50% of the time isnt as jarring as not having anything new to do for a year
---
Quad boils down to more bullets per second in the long run, just like faster fire rate, so it is definitely multiplicative.
---
I have a Junkies faster fire, 250 DR while reloading if you’re on PS4. Free of charge
---
Thank you all for the advice.  I appreciate the help
---
I've only had one bad experience with this. I was low level and some guy jetpacked in and one-shotted me. Ever since, I'm always pretty cautious, and rarely attempt to claim an owned workshop. 
---
The bit that confuses me is how do people know? I've never seen any kind of notification saying "*** is attempting to claim *** workshop", so are these people just hanging around waiting to pick a fight?
---
And is there any benefit? Why don't they just wait til you've finished, then claim it for themselves if they need to? I really couldn't give two shits if I get kicked out after a minute. It's not like I'm wasting any resources building stuff that will just be instantly non-existent as soon as I log off anyway.
---
If I'm grossly misunderstanding the usefulness of workshops, I'm happy to be educated
---
That’s a good point about makeshift warrior.. I could drop that a point, still want to have stabilized for the heavy gun though.
---
Biggest sacrifice I’ll have to make is to carry weight. Currently at around 550 when in my excavator, and that also includes some weight reduction perks. If damage output is going to take a hit on Tuesday though I guess that means sacrificing something.
---
Your build is interesting! Not sure if I could live without class freak though
---
ill take it rn
---
I have a 2 shot  minigun , 33% vats hit chance , fire rate 209 and it does work ( in vats ) .
---
No. Remove the limit altogether. Increase scrip limit to 10000
---
the double barrel and pump action could use armor piercing , since the combat shotgun has armor piercing.
---
 faction grind is too  long sucks wish they would do something to make it easier
---
It didn't "just stop," it was a 10 week event that ran as scheduled.
---
No not really, I want balance, I want new content and I want the bugs to be fixed, you have asked for only bug fixes and yeah some people ask for only content, both of those are ways to ruin the game.  
---
Like I wouldnt mind if the new content had a little bit of a delay to fix the main quest, but stopping all new content so they can fix a flaoting bush or some BS who cares
---
I got two of those Drifter outfit really like them now can use for nuclear winter
---
Yea there actually is a gate but not the fallout 4 gate. Its a car that slides. Not sure if its ever coming out though.
---
Very good for increasing the melee damage bonus from things like glowing meat steaks and etc.
---
Miner lady is cruel about giving you what you want. Nocturnal rolling pins she’s got and endless supply.
---
They collect it. But then hoard it until the very end but by then we have usually failed. It's stupid people won't turn the shit in and finish the mission quicker.
---
Didn’t know they reverted the change. Thanks for letting me know.
---
also works with switching first and third person ;;)
---
I'm most excited by rhe legendary perks, I'm dreading the universal nerfs, and my sneak commando being made useless in the Brotherhood ops!
---
Also dreading the new seasons challenges to auto complete because Bethesda still hasn't fixed it yet!
---
The new fallout franchise is most certainly a collection of hoarding based games. The entire point of the game is to get, maintain, and amass loot. Whether that be weapons, armor, junk, or currency, the games primary gameplay loop is focused of the acquisition of new, better, or more stuff.
---
You have always had certain limits on certain aspects like building and player carrying capacity, but never has the game told you to stop picking stuff up because your stash box full. Coming out of Fallout 4 into 76 they had a good system that their player base generally accepted. They decided to throw that away in exchange for a games as a service model that the community obviously would like to see changed. We asked for multiplayer fallout, what we got was Bethesda’s attempt at a cash cow to hold them over until the next elder scrolls.
---
Even more satisfying? Timing it just right and one hit killing the Fog Crawlers during Primal Cuts *before* they can land a hit.
---
There is a search bar for things like this or just looking at the pinned post with patch notes.
---
What about the ever popular Troubeshooters Knife with 3 ranged effects?
---
It’s not even that, it’s that their damage resistance randomly skyrockets. There’ll be some turrets that I can one or two shot with a sledge, but other ones need like 10 hits. Super annoying, I’ve had to change my silo loadout to have hacking perks just to get through them
---
Yes, please. Please. Please. Please. PLEASE. PLEASE WITH A FUCKING CHERRY ON TOP.
---
Is paypal an accepted payment method?  Anytime I've run into this with sites in the past, switching to PayPal has resolved the issue.
---
My unarmed character is a bit nervous. I'm not going to sneak so maybe it will be shotgun time.
---
The little rust bucket scrounging about for supplies won't stop talking about them and how the "Brotherhood" will make "amends" in "due time".
---
You can rename them.
---
They're being added to the tank killer perk next update
---
Rename them
---
I just hope they don't fuck the canon up with their arrival, I can totally see them arriving on vertibirds and fucking the canon up again like the did in fallout 4 with jet
---
Inspect the chassis and there’s an option where you can change the name.
---
No problem.  They had HUGE lashback when they "fixed" the problem.  Keep in mind, it works best with Contemporary Doorway, not all of them.
---
Also paragraphs - they really add to a story.
---
Me once the first day it came out. Otherwise each time has been fine.maybe 15-20 times total.
---
Lol the stupid mods removed my post. Prob cuz the video I posted shows names of the idiots. No idea why these threads are getting downvoted either. It's not hard to take down a full squad if you drug up and get good positioning, but ofc when anyone does that it's cheats LOL.
---
I'd hate if players like aceu or shroud come into the BR and start slaying squads. Immediately going to be called cheaters cuz the fo76 community is full of crybabies who don't even know how to hold a mouse and have the game-sense of a toddler.
---
I swear the people that were hackusating me were brainless. Shit, I'd be amazed at all aim no brain players, but their aim was terrible too. These type of dumbasses had the audacity to call me a cheater lol it was just sad.
---
Also who is actually downvoting this thread? Those crybabies that suck at playing the BR?
---
From what I'm seeing, Bethesda is reusing building structures from FO4, so i don't they are going to change any of them to really fit the theme of the game (Appalachia). However, i do agree tgat a little alteration like able to stack/snap concrete flooring to fill in the gaps in the bottom of your CAMP so it looks like a more realistic build would be better. Also having the other floorings to attach to the foundation would be nice as well.
---
And get rid of floating, if it's possible. I dont know how many times I've been denied structural setups or item placement do to "this item is floating and can't be placed" when it clearly can be put there, even when i have a flooring clearly placed or my walls are structurally sound.
---
It is, however I have already tried paypal as well as card.
---
Those torches are the nicest lights in the game.
---
Money.
---
It and spike armor *exist* in the game, but they’re unobtainable. Just on corpses and shit.
---
I’m sorry I’m not online at the moment
---
I don't think so.    
---
I kind of remember reading how Glitchesda has learned how many players(myself included) want to collect and keep our Gold perk cards. I'm not for sure 100% on that.
---
And allies please.
---
Just giving you a hard time. I thought that’s what happened haha
---
Or hitting sneak
---
It's not the most ideal solution but an effective one is just to rename your PA frames, so you can distinguish between each one.
---
Fraid not, they're nerfing pistols along with everything else on Tuesday!
---
Thank you soo much :) will add your PSN when I get home
---
I wish they could add the .45 pistol in the new update. I mean the brotherhood are coming from the west coast right? So I see no reason why they wouldn’t do it except for time constraint
---
Buy it from a player vendor. That's the only reliable way. Otherwise, you roll the dice just like everyone else.
---
Im also stuck on this
---
That's not true. There was a time when bobbles stacked woth themselves. People were duping damage bobbles and using hundreds at a time for massive damage numbers.
---
No range. As long as your on their team.
---
Those PVP players that are here get downvoted and are instantly considered a griefer. Single player gamers have the mindset the game revolves around them. In 76 this is possible for them via private servers. Meanwhile I can't even get survival settings my own private server. Icing on the cake is I payed full price and most of those complaining jumped in after they were basically giving copies away.
---
Yes yes yes 1000x yes!!!
---
Yea. People are gonna be throwing away tons of weapons
---
Congrats! I’ve got a troubleshooter’s fixer - that and the stealth armor have made silos a lot easier.
---
I want double action MOD, fanning fire, dual wielding, S&amp;W M500-like monster hand cannon... or simply buff base damage of revolvers.
---
Their website has been fucked for at least a week now.
---
I've been trying to cancel a first renewal for
---
5 days but the site won't load so I can't.  It renewed itself thankfully and now I have another month of ass I don't want.  Apparently the part of the website that takes your money still works just fine.
---
Thank you soo much. I haven't looked into a junky build much yet, would you recommend it?
---
They got rid of that because some people like collecting them and didn't like the idea of having an incentive of scrapping them.
---
On a side note they added a challenge for 50 extra perk coins when you hit 50 and those over 50 will auto complete this and get the coins as a way to make up for those of us who are high level and lost cards or spent points on moving perk points.
---
I don't know why they tied coins to scrapping cards it should of just been tied to level. Give us 2 per level and 5 or so coins every 5th level. No one misses out on anything and then just having scrap cards as a feature so we can clean out the ones we don't want and keep the perk points for if people want to respec their character.
---
While the turrets have been buffed in one Wasteland, so have all the enemies, so your turrets will break twice as fast now!
---
It's best not to have any turrets at all as all they do is draw agro to things they can't fight back against!
---
Magic effect is basically bugged Furious tied to other effects. Explosive effect cancel furious effect because of the splash damage. As soon as your explosion hit something else, it cancels the furious hit counts.
---
I really hope it evolves like how eso has, eso has made huge strides in the past few years and it's so much better for it
---
My 2 main guns were broken, I was using a regular combat rifle. While also overcumbered.
---
There is a difference between abuse and killing others.    
---
It is a post-apocalyptic world that is the core of Fallout. If they get upset when it's not abuse and harassment then they don't understand that world.
---
Stop asking for less 3 star enemies to spawn.
---
Every.
---
Fucking.
---
Week.
---
Feel free to add me on psn: cattabliss. After Tuesday I'll probably be doing a lot of map exploring to see the One Wasteland changes
---
Oh yeah, that's a great one too. And Deathclaws as well lol.
---
Wow didn’t even know that thank you!!
---
This shit up vote
---
Murgleburgle gave me a 3 star vampires sheepsquatch staff club thing for 50 scrip.
---
Lucky me?
---
Didn’t know we could do that thank you!!
---
You know this isn't Fallout: New Vegas, right?
---
Yeah, I don’t need the caps, so are usually sell them pretty cheap between 1500 and 2000 caps.
---
Whether you like it or not is completely irrelevant to the fact that this is not a hoarding game and pretending it is won't get you anywhere
---
So I'm having this issue with the red scare pack, but I have the normal plan for jetpack and it is able to be crafted, but not the red scare.
---
A lvl 298 killed me today after watching me defend the shop. I don't care for PVP but claim the shops in order to receive the items and plans. What gets me is there are usually a million other places to claim. If you're 250 lvls above someone, is it really PVP at that point or is it just murder lmao? I literally just learned about the pacifist mode today. Hopefully this makes a difference in my playing experience.
---
Far too generous :) what breed are your little one/s?
---
Now that’s a knife!
---
I’m looking forward to Cold War
---
I wish they would give us that bar as a prefab.
---
Looking forward to running Daily Ops for real, been playing on the PTS a lot and it's really fun.  It's going to be great to actually run around the map wherever you want and get good exp. I can't wait to do all the lower-level events at a normal level. Going to run my lower level character as well since the low-level experience has changed drastically.
---
I also have the unsalted popcorn ready for all the salty posts.
---
You can also hit the back/double-square or whatever it is on PS4 and make it look like PA’s view, too.
---
Edit: Love the look. And it works great if you’re invisible. (Cant see fuck all with light green text AND invisibility.😑)
---
Near the very western edge of the map, not too far from Tanagra for acid runs. I was camped over there for a while and it was surprisingly quiet.
---
What Bethesda was really saying was that private servers and PVE players were a better cash cow to milk. 
---
I still dont understand why I can't change PVP settings in my own private server.
---
I'm worried that I will now have less of a chance of launching a nuke solo. Couldn't do it with my level 125 character, so now that the enemies will be closer to my level I'm not going to be able to do it unless I change around my build.
---
I’ve had this small patch of flat land by an environmental sensor in the far northwest. Had a cabin there since launch. I think I’ve had to change worlds 5 times maximum this whole time. It is so damn peaceful.
---
Well, you can server hop.
---
Well, the community has spoken. Im not gonna lie I thought more people would want something like this but guess I was wrong.
---
They're not really "special" effects. OP is talking about having to buy more plans and use resources to make mods that currently exist for power armor helmets. No one has a problem with PA helmet mods, do they?
---
 Does Bethesda even read this subreddit? Doesn’t seem like it.
---
tbh the right response to qol mods would be actually *adding* those features, not *banning* people. those modders are literally fixing your shit for free bethesda, just pay em to do it officially.
---
Can I get it?
---
Yes to this! It’s in base game of fallout 4 so should already be in the game files of 76.
---
Thats what some people did. I took over 3 workshops, did not lock anything. Had pipboy signs to point to the resource to indicate free reources, and some ass would just took over n lock it
---
I know right? At first I thought there was some technical reason that they couldn't tie perk points to levels...but then they gave us the 50 at 50...so I don't get it...
---
*We aren’t quite sure. We’ll let our robotic liaison team consisting of Sergeant Maximus (Mk VII Sentrybot) and Lieutenant M.E.D.U.S.A. (Prototype Assaultron) discuss this with your... robo-janitor.*
---
This shows how inept the devs are. This has been a complaint since beta. Simple fix, nowhere to be found lol.
---
I think it's wonderful you helped them. I just started the game and I am still not sure what I'm doing. At the moment I run away if I see someone else or hide. Someone came up to me today, started to jump on me and then he run away. I was level 6, he was level 80. I don't know what he wanted. I'm still going to play the game, but as a newbie, it kind of startled me. Awesome game though.
---
Oh, I see, this is concerning
---
I used to do this was well - if I'm short on cores I'd drop by for one - if the machine was locked, id claim the workshop, take the cores, unlock it and get on with my day.
---
This. What about those of us who paid full price and had what we paid for taken away???
---
There are no ropes.    
---
I'm on PC but helping with advice is still the same. Play it. The game will teach you a lot. If you expect to be hand held then you're not going to enjoy it.    
---
In any new game I go in knowing as little as possible. I learn more from progression and making mistakes.    
---
In Fallout, there's no way to 'play correctly'. There's so much freedom in this series it's ridiculous. It does allow for your playstyle to be your own.    
---
The only thing I will suggest is looking up and learning about Fallout 76 builds. Your character cannot do everything. Builds are essential.    
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)    
---
After choosing a build, use that site to create one and save the link for future reference. Near the bottom is a Level by Level Perk suggestion list. I suggest sticking to it.    
---
You cannot bank Perk points until after 50. New perks don't show up until you start spending them therefore a build is needed.
---
The red blinking light, I think it’s either the first or second light option on the menu. Just press right on the D-Pad. You’ll find it. 
---
The flags are under floor decoration. Just like the signs that you saw. 
---
And the responder workbenches are just skins for the workbenches you already have. I think it only applies for the weapon and the power armor station. That’s it. 
---
The axes and firefighter helmet should be under wall decorations.
---
This is insane. Why aren't they doing anything about this? I've seen so many people have problems with 1st recently and now I am also having troubles. I hope they resolve this.
---
Yep, not a bug, just an option to change hud if we want 👍
---
Blah blah blah bluh bluh bluh blah
---
blah.
---
blegh.
---
They will not listen
---
Id love that but, man, it'd take me a long while to trust it to not lose my gear.
---
I heard of bash dmg working for shotguns only, but I have a 33vats AA combat shotgun that seems fairly magical in vats only. Got a vamp minigun with bash dmg that I havent tried out yet, but you gotta have a piece of armor with reduced dmg while blocking to trigger that specific magical effect i think
---
Is that the one from the hunters shack?
---
I just got the one spoiled gcc :) he would probably freak if I ever brought him a sibling haha
---
My psn is cattabliss if you ever need that help!
---
it would take like 500 pounds of mini nukes to kill SBQ
---
For fusion cores. Yes. Unless a new glitch that allows us to blueprint our own fusion factory
---
"No, that's not a knyfe. This....is a knyfe." Crocodile Dundee with his big stabby pokey thing.
---
It's because your light will be seen by other people, they're trying to reduce server calculations. They offer 5-6 colours of helmet light, they've pre done the maths for how those colours work and reflect "in world" for the player and other players around them.  
---
If you add another 16.4 million options of lighting colour, that's a bit more computation to run through.
---
fair point though it's like that for all fallout games.  attire is based on faction rather than environment when it should be a combination of both
---
Do you know anything about the vendor machine signs and where they are in the menu?
---
50 caps would sell out immediately, 100 caps would take a while, I  stopped when the stealth suit came out.
---
Hey, if your on xbox, just give me their usernames.
---
But according to the vid explosive essentially doubles the fire rate. I just don't have the correct 3rd effect like bash damage
---
I guess it would vary.
---
I mean, I imagine you would deal more damage if you fisted a ghoul as opposed to fisting the SBQ...
---
Colour blind maybe? We go back to The Dress phenomenon!
---
transfer disposable items. wait for it to trip up and delete your garbage. file a ticket to Bethesda. get free compensation.
---
The thing is since no one really does it, I don't think that there is a solid build for someone like that. 
---
You go the whole healing support route with team medic and maybe even friendly fire or go the buff/debuff route with tenderiser and suppressor, maybe even inspirational that you can share with the rest of the team for XP boost. Maybe even lean into vampiric legendaries to make yourself especially tanky with bolstering or vanguard.
---
As for how you fill out the rest of that build though...?
---
It might be worthwhile not to go all in with 15 charisma as there aren't that many 4 and 5 rank perks that are worth sharing. 9 should be plenty to give your team a decent shared perk e.g. inspirational, without compromising the rest of your build.
---
Thank you, I really appreciate the advice. 
---
Even with the legendary sale on at the moment, 3-stars have been pretty limiting with daily gambles. Now that you point it out, vendor hopping would also help me scrap for mods if I can find some cheap lever actions.
---
That's awesome. Also I think I played a few games with you today, I never forget a name like that.
---
Change it in the . Ini I did it first day. Been solid white ever since.
---
Would you says it’s in the hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands
---
Same with the fence, right?
---
that's not really an option for the prefabs.  also not a fan of using powered doors on most builds.  I'm all about that immersion and it doesn't fit well with most of my builds but i do use them (specifically the keypad door) when I build military compound style builds
---
PS4, had to stay true to my childhood gaming providers haha.
---
This is one of my biggest joys in the game. I love sharing 🤗
---
I've been wanting something like this for the longest time. I get tired of keep having to change out perks. Alas, I'm on Xbox so I guess it's a no no for me. I'm sad now.
---
Operant conditioning.
---
I've not had a console since my XBOX, can you pull the drive and view the file structure with a pc?
---
One wasteland will make junkies less attractive, but if you get one with explosive then it might be okayish
---
My quad explosive fixer is coming up all Milhouse!
---
No, it's bad enough the scrap box is locked behind that shit
---
Lol. I just posted about this. This is rule 1 for posting dumb shit on Reddit. Delete it or own it but never try to explain it away. 
---
Have my upvote.
---
Yes. Its so frustrating. Well come to FO76
---
Yea no response theres like no pc players i feel like i can't do anything in this reddit because the markets are dead there is no pc players
---
Bro literally said dont bring up the markets
---
Well I did work out a heavy Gunner charisma build at first with 15 charisma it was meant to be a support tank. But with the heavy guns nerfs I'm not  sure what to even make my main weapon. And as for the reason I want 15 is because according to what I read it increases rewards for the whole team.
---
Yup. Works too.
---
"It just works."
---
Downvoting this comment... because 69 is better than 70 lol.
---
It's okay, drink coffee and drive on.
---
Maybe I'll try something else
---
Calling u/LadyDevann.  This sounds like something you might want to look into.
---
All reddit posters that called for bloodied to be nerfed shouldn't be allowed to run nerd rage, serendipity, and other perks that go into bloodied builds. That's just my two cents. All builds could've ran all the exact same perks. They just didn't know how to build a proper build now all builds pay for it. Congrats Reddit. If someone sacrifices 80% health their should be a bigger difference the 30 hit points compared to junkies. I'm just saying.
---
Dang,was hopin you was Xbox,so I could have helped...
---
Regardless,since this community F’IN ROCKS!!
---
You’re getting the help ya need,&amp; I’m thankful fer it.
---
Be well Wastelander!
---
May yer ammo never run out,&amp; yer carry weight always be light!
---
This nerf is not as crazy as everyone makes it seem. Every weapon is still viable. Max Rifleman Perks and addictions will make Junkies a great weapon.
---
Neh, everything should be unlimited.
---
Great! I’ll add you
---
Don't bother because on Tuesday the update drops and enemies are going to be scaled to your level no matter where you are
---
Too true. I've gone through a fair amount of dice-rolls during the legendary sale, and haven't even found a decent alternative type of rifle to match my build.
---
I'm PS4, are you also? If so, what's your PSN?
---
This is actually good advice. You can go nuts trying for one particular thing and you won't get it until you give up. Then it shows up.
---
I think we all have.  We should start a club, and make jackets.    
---
"I killed Earle and all I got was a 3 Star Rolling Pin"
---
I'm excited, I hope it works well!
---
I just want to wear clothes over stealth armour
---
What level are you though
---
Straight East of Middle Mountain Cabins there is a lake to build on and you’re in the middle of the Savage Divide. Close to Whitesprings, Emmit Mountain Disposal, West-Tek and Hunterville. Lots of vendor traffic guaranteed!
---
Probably not on Earl and the SBQ because of the damage resistance curve, but I'd bet QE's will be great for the Imposter sheep squash and regular squatches
---
If they would put some effort into fixing PVP issues like Nuka spamming it would still have the beta feel. They finally fixed God mode only because it would effect SCORE rank purchases. Most long term players have had a run in with unkillable players. The real frustration is not knowing if you were outplayed or if they exploited.
---
They only care about money, so have F1 people be guinie pigs
---
I will look that spot up, thank you!
---
I have had turrets disappear into the terrain while moving them.
---
I sold them to vendor bots. 3* junks. Not even heart pain about it
---
I’ve recently switched to more commando guns, but up until then, I was running a simple 1* instigating lever action that when combined with sneak and rifleman buffs would 1-shot about 3/4 of the mobs I came across.  Very ammo efficient
---
The signs from the responder? Under wall decorations.
---
I am looking forward to the new special ops cosmetics from the atom shop.
---
The 38 point boost isn’t enough to have much impact in terms of punching through their 400 DR.
---
I’m not grinding, I just cashed in all my scrip and have over 40 3 star guns
---
Don’t exit, switch to modify. Don’t disagree it would be good if it popped out but at least you don’t have to exit
---
Thanks for tip.
---
I honestly would love this, but also do it for the hud as well. Since all of this crap is client side they can't use the server stability excuse.
---
It’s actually 14 points more than junkies.
---
Not every challenge awards atoms, some award perk card packs. Check the challenges page and make sure they are marked as completed and check your Atoms balance as that gets automatically updated.
---
If you're still having trouble, I'd suggest logging a ticket with support.
---
Really do we know if it would be a powered gate or manual. Where did you see that?
---
You kinda need to be able to bring the pipboy up for inventory, really doubt they could force it to bring the overlay instead just because no pipboy.
---
Maybe a sleeker one in the future, but it's not going anywhere.
---
Fyi; you'll need to have the questline completed or they will not drop for you.
---
That’s exactly what OP is suggesting
---
Saw in the data miner discord I think its manual
---
Did you complete the questline? It won't drop if you didn't.
---
So do the queen of the hunt quest line?
---
It's just one of them unexplainable phenomenons that plague our existence. it works everytime though, literally happened with my phone the other week, I'm sure someone more attached at the hip to their phone would have upended their house looking for it, but mine just made its way back to me through someone else picking it up a day or two later. Ftr my niece had hidden it, I didn't misplace it.
---
Did you just watch juicehed’s video
---
Just so you know, you need to complete the questline or it will not drop
---
They are for atoms. My issue is the game is not registering my kills.
---
Bloodied is still king. I've done plenty of testing on psts. But yea. Its not even significant. Lol
---
Maybe...
---
What do you know, it's a small world!
---
You can get it to probably high hundreds+ with perks and mutations.
---
Getting ammo factory and holding off on the rest. I am concerned that Bethesda will nerf the most used damage boosting perk  (whatever perk that ends up being).  I  don't want to sink hard earned points into a perk just to have it nerfed.
---
I might not even get ammo factory. I might just scrap my extra cards on hold on to my coins.
---
I feel certain that Bethesda will be making further changes to this system,  and not in a way that benefits the player.
---
What are magic weapons?
---
meh, feels like something theyd pass on unless it was to buy with atoms and tbh im spending a lot less in my next 1780 hours in 76 thats fersure lol just a shoulder mount would be enough for me, lights up when equipped, when un equipped, just like mining helmets, revert to pipboy?
---
No you'll have to find a poster about the sheepsquatch, I think they're at trainstations, and then head to lewisburg taxedemery or however that thing is called, to start.
---
No shame. It was a very long video.
---
Yea there is an inventory option where you dont look at it did you forget mister smarty pants
---
It's such a gamble to get them a companion. Half the time I can't even tell if my Lorikeets are playing or fighting. I don't think even they're sure some times haha. 
---
Cheers :) I'll send a request through when I get home.
---
If by balancing you mean making everything super weak then yeah it does that. All that stuff you grinded for months for because it would put out so much damage and it was the best? Too bad, that’s now equivalent to a crafted pipe gun :/
---
thanks.  ill google it.
---
King in lots of areas just not sustained DPS.
---
Depend what is the file system used on this drive, not sure this gonna work on windows but on linux you can easily learn all file system also, this is probably encrypted by Microsoft so i doubt about it, and it's probably extremely complicated to extract data from specific game without permission/recommended tool.
---
I know that Sony use an linux system structure so on Windows you can't learn the drive because it's doesn't recognize ext3/ext4 file system.
---
Thanks for explaining what im doing wrong and not being an asshole
---
Most likely a download that will take two days to complete. 😐
---
I'll probably upgrade Ammo Factory so I don't have to go gather lead as often. 
---
I'd like to add some survivability mods to my stealth commando for bossing and the anti-stealth(?) daily op, but I want to see what others do before I do anything I'll regret.
---
Because magic weapons exist, I think I'll be fine in the bossing department so Follow Through will be delayed until later. 
---
I don't nuke so Infiltrator won't benefit me as much as it does others.
---
Seems like everytime I go there it’s only pods that show up
---
There is very few prime real-estate spots in the game. Places where you can place water purifiers and crops and then actually try and have a personality as build something. The camp budget needs to be a bit bigger too.

It is upwards of 2k listed damage on mine, but that factors in as a fully kitted bloody unarmed.

You pay for your wife?

And also give console the ability to change the pip boy color I’m not a big fan of the radioactive green

Been bloodied since day one before it was cool. No plans to change. Lol

The leather coat feels awesome and scrappy but the drop rate is so ridiculously low
---
But, I love the Green shirt and Combat boots outfit. Bought the Silvershroud outfit. Managed to finally get the hunter coat. Still went back to the green shirt cause it looks like something I'd actually wear. The long coats are ok, but I don't like them buttoned up. Drifter comes a close second.
---
Yh I wear on my first character took hours of event grinding
---
You're probably right, it's hard to wrap my head around all the implications of additive vs multiplicative
---
Damn that thing looks cool once they finish it. Thanks for the link
---
My BFFR25 handmade and fixer sustains just fine compared to any other in the pts. Lmao
---
Combat shotgun lacks skins....
---
another victim of negligence
---
Yeasssss please!!!!
---
I'm trying to make a replica of the little house on the prairie farm along Plum Creek. 
---
I still have yet to find adequate land and the materials dont quite fit right for a really good duplication.
---
After this patch my emotes wheel no longer shows any emotes apparently they all got unchecked for use i just rechecked them in atom store weird but hopefully it helps someone with same problem
---
0 crashes and 2 ceiling bugs. Never had the can't respawn glitch either. Done it at least over 20 times by now.
---
Edit: scratch that first crash...
---
there are thousands of people paying for Fallout 1st so they can hoard junk.
---
South of bog town has 4 event spots plus grahm paths by also it is a 30 second wun to wipe out the super mutants in the town so quick scrap and the occasional legendary.   
---
The only thing I dislike there if you go to the junk pile area is that dogs will spawn sometimes so I have to keep 3 turrets which is 3 more than I like but if you go north just a little to the steel pile it is not much of an issue. but depending on where it wants to spawn you on fast travel could trigger the bog town super mutants.   
---
Just north of Watoga has some fine pieces of land also near X9, I like having enemy spawns and events close by personally. Right now I am south of the double resource spot by watoga it gives me super mutants/ghouls,bog horde events (super funny they normally all spawn in my cafe area) and there is always a giant hermit crab 15 seconds away along with a event spawn point.   
---
Some nice view places in the divide. Personally never cared for toxic valley though I used to have a raider style camp there. Mire is alright it has some areas for interesting builds not much in the way of views though but it has it's ambiance.   
---
If you want player neighbors I advise south of whitesprings past the greens you will be close enough to people to feel around others and if you do it at the miner monument you will have spawns to kill.This also makes it more likely that you will not have can't not place CAMP issues. CAMP building is the number one draw for me in this game 5-10 camps a month 2 on each character and I stay in the same spot for only a month and they are all spread around. Though that may change for 1 character depending on my luck and if I get that damn giddy up buttercup ride.
---
Plus all other builds reap rewards with no risk.
---
We all do in one way or another, she feels like she's been paying since we got married
---
A Q25 with your same build will outdo it.
---
Heavy guns nerf? If you're referring to the upcoming damage calculation changes, it's just a change to damage calculations. They pretty much stay relatively the same as they use to be. 
---
There was a problem with energy weapons early on but Bethesda fixed that a little while ago on the PTS.
---
As for the 15 CHR thing, yeah it gives XP bonus a boost but only for group events. In practice, I've not seen it affect just general team play. So unless you're specifically focusing down those sorts of events, then it's pretty niche. 
---
I mean if you can make a build work around that where you're not otherwise dead weight, sure go for it. Just not what I would do.
---
I literally use that option, but go assuming. I said FORCING it, as in, it's an *Option*. There's probably coded reasons for that being impossible knowing Bethesda.
---
Ended up thinking I'll go with this - thanks for the pointers!

---
Thanks for the advice, it seems like that would be the better option. I'm starting to feel as if Murmrgh has something personally against me haha.
---
I havnt had any bad experiences either and ive played since a little after the beta. I even took a shop at lvl 20 from a lvl 300 and he was just like hey this is mine and I can kill you being here. And I was like oh seriously? Because I had zero clue what it was and he just let me have it along with a bunch of supplies.
---
I played for 3 hours when fallout was released on steam and they gave me the free copy. Then around july 25th i went to log in and play. I was banned for duping or cheating idk. I got all my weapons from the golf course back when the game first came out in 2018 and then stopped playing the game until steam release. I can promise you I haven't duped a single thing nor brought a single thing from the vending thing. They swear up and down I cheated and will not reinstate my account.
---
No they don’t
---
The game lacks good skins across the board. I emphasise *good* skins.
---
Im not a 'made man', pimp or cartel boss. I don't need ivory and gold shit. So many games think people actually want that crap. 
---
Outside of the black skins for Combat Rifle and HM most of them are pretty tragic. Just some plain matte blacks and chromes would be fine.
---
If you run 20% health
---
And that's fine if u like that sorta stuff but take the setterlers who are all around the map and take the ash heap for example you see a setterler in a t shirt and slacks with no gas mask on in one of the most dangerous areas with polluted air now reimagine the same setterler but in a reinforced hazmat suit like a normal one but with metal armour playing over the top of it or a setterler with a mole miner rags on with a gas mask that they got from killing one that in my opinion would look and feel fallouty
---
Damage dealt and damage taken used to both be multiplicative, now only damage taken is. Quad boosts damage taken.
---
68 is better than 69 cos it's you blow me and i'll owe you one 
---
=0
---
The new damage model is whack.
---
You're welcome, but I don't think any of the guys here were rude :). For the market sub, you might wanna take some time and search for some of the items, look through some posts and get a general idea of what the prices are. Sometimes it takes a while even for good offers to be noticed, we are all in different time zones, so that's quite normal. 
---
For the mounted plans, you might have better luck vendor hopping, as they are not very requested or traded usually. For the Grahm plan, bear in mind that soon we should be having another meat week, so you'll ne able to farm Grahm for it. Good luck :).
---
Ill admit I have gotten my moneys worth. But i do wish they would stop watering the game down to please a crowd that complained about this game before it even released. I can tolerate the bugs, nerfs and such. Balance is good but removing core game mechanics isn't balance.
---
Aren't you better off putting the points into INT if you want an XP bonus?
---
Never mind. Only skimmed the post and replies.
---
The only problem is that the normal perks to boost damage only add like 30 damage now. Captainoob showed this on one of his recent livestreams. 9 perk points for 30 damage. Ridiculous.
---
Thats called a bug
---
100 modules? What are you doing with all that extra weight?
---
I missed it last year too :( I hope it comes back, it sounded quite fun.
---
Lol damn, just walked into a timewarp to 1989...
---
Thanks for the nostalgia homeslice.
---
Sorry man. That sucks. Hope you found some other game to substitute your Fallout 76 fix.
---
The small letters are in wall decorations but you have to buy or find the plans. I think they are just listed as "Small Letters"
---
My wife is running ammo factory so that frees up my legendary perk choices. I'm not even sure what else I'm running grabbing, haha!
---
Played since day one and pretty much logged in every day since, however I stopped logging in two weeks ago.  I've been playing Ghost of Tsushima, have a few DLCs downloaded for other games and I have a few other games on pre-order. From what  people on the play test servers are saying,  my sneak build (not a bloodied or junkies), instigating semi-auto guns and everything else about my character and weapons are getting nerfed to worthless. I just want the patch to drop so I can log in, laugh at the nonsense Bethesda finds acceptable and then go back to playing other games. You guys should try not logging in to this game for a week or two and go play something else. It's quite refreshing.
---
Not bad, but can I get a full size, fully functioning Giddyup Buttercup instead?
---
Ammo factory, what rads and master infiltrator are the first three I'm eyeing up, probably only gonna get one rank of master infiltrator for now and focus on fully upgrading ammo factory because it looks nutty. What rads just look like a fantastic utility to have. Taking one for the team also looks like a very solid option as there's not really am excuse for not being on a team. But I'd definately go for ammo factory first, it's just such a nice thing to not have to constantly worry about ammo. Combine it with super duper and ammo smith and you'll be absolutely loaded. Master infiltrator is a close second since it frees up perk slots for other better perks.
---
The 60% boost for all 9 perks would ad 29 points to a fixer.
---
It’s pretty easy to get. I have a backlog of like 200 treasury notes waiting to be redeemed.
---
I'm looking forward to ops, too. I've purposely avoided running it so it's a fresh experience. Cheers my guy!
---
What bug?
---
It really does :) The responses I've received from this post have made my day. I'll be sure to come back to this post if cross-platform ever becomes a thing.
---
Hahah and may the RNG mistress look favourably on you in the future :)
