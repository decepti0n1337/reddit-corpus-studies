geesus so that's why i never find better lining
---
Well, they DID catch him "choppin" on his cell mate lol
---
What about for guns? I mainly sat in my power armor but might have to explore armor options
---
I just got this too, working fine last night, did notice though that my 7 year old was turning on the second controller messing around as it was loggin in. Maybe it thought i was doing shady shit.
---
Nice never seen a glowing mothman.
---
I didn't do anything ban worthy!?!?!?!? Unless me attacking two kids over and over again because they harassed me on my low level acc is considered ban worthy...yet they still initiated the pvp. So I switched to my main and they still felt like trying to fight me. I am confused!! I just was able to play last night.
---
Uh huh
---
I wish
---
I hear you, I‚Äôve been going back and forth with tech support all day. I think they did a bunch of false bans on accident.
---
you are trying to put it on the torso correct?
---
what i mean is there is bos plans for arms not for light arms &amp; sturdy arms &amp; heavy arms
---
Legs
---
The foundation is there for something truly special, but the game suffers from a major lack of content. The bugs and server disconnects don't help either. I'm personally taking a break until something substantial happens. It's a good thing though. I spent about 150 hours on the game and therefore got my money's worth, and now I get to work through my backlog and am experiencing some truly amazing games. 
---
100% this idea!!
---

---
My pool table looks stupid with no balls on it.
---
My bathtubs look dumb without $500,00 in prewar money dumped in there.
---
Why give us magazine racks and display shelves when we can‚Äôt display anything? I spent a lot of time turning my CAMP into a bar, but it looks ridiculous because I can‚Äôt have bottles of vodka and wine anywhere... 
---
That would be your problem, motion-assist is a torso mod.
---
There are a few in a ramshackle flower shop on the outskirts of whitesprings.  In the strip where the toy shop is.
---
I get what you are trying to say but there aren't really that many spots that have 100% chance to drop legendaries loot let alone high level legendary loot. (Unless you have a crew and are able to farm whitesprings golf course) While the event may drop level 40 loot it's better than nothing as you will be able to make rolls on getting legendary gear 100% of the time. The only other way to farm legendaries that doesn't involve nuking I know of is a violent night which only has 1 legendary enemy or horde events which range in levels wildly. So it's still worth the time. Even if the gear is 10 levels lower than the "best possible gear". Personally I'd rather have a piece of armor that has really good legendary effects than another piece of amor with less helpful effects but plus maybe 10 or so damage resist.
---
 
---
I tried them all though. Torso, arms, legs even helmet
---
Yep me too. I had some ammo and junk that was duped prob by someone but given to me to hold for someone. They let me have some of it. This was all months ago.  I dumped most of it before this past update.  
---
I've got a few and can craft the suppressor after a long slog.. They spawn every now and then in the bunker above Uncanny Caverns and also at the top of the world where rose is.
---
Thx
---
Sorry about that, the list is very old. But it‚Äôs the only one I could find for you
---
At one point I had a million tato‚Äôs. But I ate them all, still feel sick......
---
Thanks for showing your support! I was hoping i'd find some other player home connoisseurs. 
---
If the torso and mod are both t-51 it should show up as an option to install it.
---
Whenever I need cores, I take over a power plant until I get about 30
---
Do you need all the components to see it
---
Can you post link here, i just got hit with the same shit.
---
If you kill me in pvp, you will usually get 1 raw fertilizer......lol
---
no worries.  thanx for trying.
---
I know the noise. Go 3rd person camera and it goes.
---
Gun effects mostly depend. for stealth snipers people seem to revolve around bloodied explosive. for faster firing guns im also guessing bloodied explosive.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;!i am a PVE pleb who plays for fun, i have a vampire's explosive .50 cal for my big guns power armor character!&lt;
---
Lol I like it
---
the last few days the turrets in my camp fire almost non stop at nothing. when in sneak, i show danger, but nothing is there 
---
I apologize if this has been asked and address, but why can't we use unarmed items (ex; mole miner gauntlet, power fist) in Power Armors?  If I were to partake in a nuke zone I have to switch to one-handed or two-handed, or spec in a weapon that does less damage than my main.  
---
Right now I possess Excavation and Ultracite armors but I can't use them unless I spend points into another weapon category (which is fine, but will take forever since I have the mutations I need)
---
As long as Bethesda implement it properly it meaning we could choose if players could pick up our loot or not. Would be nothing worse than showing off a display of bobble heads for them all to be swiped.
---
I collect various teddy bears &amp; children‚Äôs toys and have them stashed purely waiting for this update so I can proudly display them. 
---
It may be a glitch to. I sent a thing in to Bethesda. I played a lot of caps for it
---
I promise it is running on fusion, not crickets..lol so I wish they would vacate the premisis
---
I'm guessing you've never played ark? 
---
Thanks! That's all very helpful
---
Tried this fairly recently, and it didn't seem to work anymore. 
---
no you should just need the PA part on a frame, and the frame at the power armor station. Then (best to have mod on you) in the modify it should be listed as an option like any other mod. On PC it is white text and it should list the junk it takes to make it when selected, but will let you install it.
---
Did you take turns logging out and rejoining each others to keep the Whitesprings all-u-can-kill ghoulfest going?  That would be so great.  A 4 person party of friends with our own private server would be just epic.
---
I would pay a $5 monthly fee to maintain private server space and have it be password protected or friends list only to join.
---
You picked a popular place
---
Post link to what? 
---
I've been storing every single goddamn Mr. Fuzzy in the hopes that one day I can finally flex
---
I kind of want to make a paul stametz character that grows mushrooms. You should be able to become a mushroom farmer/dealer in this game. 
---
It's a song about promiscuous sex, from back when murder was more socially acceptable than casual sex.
---
But 2 months months with daily play, multiple spawns per day and no problem... now it‚Äôs taken every single time?   Doesn‚Äôt seem right...
---
Half of my stash is just full of Jangles the moon monkey, quantum bears &amp; comrade chubs.
---
Thats where people don't understand. The people working on the Atom Shop are not the same people fixing bugs. The people brain storming new content aren't the same people programming it, the people programming it aren't the same people drawing the sketches, the people drawing the sketches aren't the same people 3D rendering, and so on and so on. Just because they update the shop doesn't mean its taking any time away from bug fixing. There are numerous teams involved. But trust me, I believe the game could be in far better shape, but I think criticism and hate should be pointed better rather than just complaining about everything. Because that seems to be the trend "hop on the hate train". Happened with Nickleback, Minecraft, Fortnite, and anything else turned meme.
---
I  put all the armour on the station, I check every part, it says no mods available, it's also a plan. Do I need to make that separately 
---
Tech support for Bethesda 
---
I rarely get anything from any PVPing I do and I stash my junk often too so its jus for fun really as I dont doin for caps. 
---
&lt;shrug&gt; I try to pick remote places
---
It‚Äôs a random spawn there. I usually see T-51b or T-60 there
---
I have them if your on xbox

---
This exactly.....the problem with the games weight management is that if your farming and see something with screws ect you feel obligated to pick it up.  This quickly adds to being overburdened if your not a PA user even more so.
---
The game flow is killed if you have to spend 30 minutes to an hour sorting through crap or building random stuff you dont need for 10 exp.  I'd rather have a stockpile from just farming for a while then go hunting legendaries and not care if I ignore all the junk.  It's far more enjoyable then the inventory management sim.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbone you can join up with me. My Enclave usually holds all of the power plants to keep ourselves supplied while instigating pvp wherever we can.
---
I got one off a legendary molerat. 
---
Not really. They are using Microsoft Xbox dev framework, so once Microsoft allows it on Xbox live, it'll work for all. 
---
Glorf you're my favourite colourful maniac üòéü§£ love the write up and pics !
---
I make all my caps by selling drugs which is why I'd love to be able to grow my own ingredients so it's not a huge chore.  You know.  Like the rest of the game...
---
Ya, I‚Äôm aware.   Not the point of the post.  But üëç
---
Am I the only one that eats corpses to get my food fill?
---
hell comes to frogtown easter egg?
---
Honestly no
---
Like seriously though what the fuck? I actually can't understand how they even FALSELY could. I haven't done shit other than play the game, obsessively so actually. I just bought the lumberjack skin too...This better be a mistake or some server issue. Hopefully buying duped items doesn't fuck anyone because I'm not confident that everything I bought from those markets are organic. But if that's the case just REMOVE THEM. Don't fuck loyal players over?! I'd rather lose my caps by having the items removed then not only losing real money from the atom shop purchases, but all my time and effort. I'm honestly anxious. I legit love this game. This is frustrating. 
---
Thanks but I‚Äôm ok. Just commenting for OP. 
---
3rd person does make it go away..thanks
---
That's an opinion though. Hardly a reason for the amount of crap people hurl at it. Yeah. Lacking in content. Okay. But is it really as bad as some people make it out to be?
---
Thx!
---
King of... A given power armor spawn location is either always Raider, or T series (random on 45, 51, or 60). If you find anything else, someone probably dropped a set for some reason.
---
Ha! I love Paul Stamets. He's fascinating to listen to. I'm not even into mycology. I'm most interested in his work on using mushrooms to clean up radiation.
---
Got to correct you, it's Lewisburg not Lewiston. Not being a dick just got to show love to the town I grew up in (in real life).
---
If you're playing solo, server hopping and running a circuit around Watoga is a GREAT source for dog food, boiled water, legendaries and xp.  I have like 30-40 cranberry juices and dog food in about an hour, plus a small pile of legendary stuff from the bots.  Drink the cranberry juice for a small xp boost.  The diner on the east side of town has a cooking stove.  
---
It's also not bad for fusion cores, as there's two frames that spawn in town, a fusion generator, and another frame and generator inside AMS headquarters.  Not to mention the random frames that spawn at Big Bend East, Camp Alpha, Flooded Trainyard, Site V9 and Fwd Delta.  You can pick up a half dozen cores in a small area very easily.
---
The fact that you can acquire all this stuff just in Watoga makes it my favorite spot to lurk.
---
Also don't do like I did the other night. Solo most the time. Had all the parts. Fought my way through the damn bunker and entered the code to launch.
---
Upon targeting the usual one tor two regular spots I jump on over to battle a scorched queen to claim my prize...Not one other MF player showed up - LOL 
---
After fighting the damn queen solo for about 15min I bugged out. Make sure others are willing to jump in and fight the bitch before wasting an hour or two.  üé∂The more you know...üé∂
---
Ok good luck I‚Äôve only seen them twice in 120 levels and I go every day to take there caps
---
If it's a plan you need to "read" it and then you can craft it if you have the scrap needed to do so.
---
Finding it hard to get all those recipes and plans for them. I can make diluted rad away and stimpacks and psychobuff, and that's it for now
---
I learned the plan. So do I need all the scrap to see the plan
---
I think there might be an issue with the engine keeping track of all the items. Based on what I've read about inventory and item management I don't know if it would be possible in the online world. I really hope it is and I miss that feature as well.
---
I have a full time a job and an infant son and I still manage to have like 3k atoms. It doesn't take much playing to get the atoms especially if you focus on doing the tasks they ask. I've actually never even atom grinded and I've beem able to buy everything I've wanted. I agree the base dollar price may be too expensive, but they aren't forcing you to pay that. If they really wanted to grub for money they would make atoms unobtainable in game.
---
no once you select it the mod on the modify part it will show you the scrap needed to make it and if you are short any you will be able to see what and how much.
---
pc hold ctrl ans scroll mouse wheel
---
hate maintaining PA compared to regular armor? did something change while i've been playing KH3
---
Oh. My problem is I cant see it
---
Yes below a certain level you can‚Äôt damage or get exp from the SBQ in return she doesn‚Äôt up the DR
---
jon glaser loves gear
---
I see where you're coming from and yes I would agree that the people working on the atom shop are not the same people working on bugs/fixes. My issue is they have very clearly spent lots of money and continue to spend lots of money on atom shop content. Yet who tested their games? Who said "ya the game is good to go we can also add micro transactions while we are at it"? I am not mad at the people creating the atom shop content, I never said I was. I'm mad at Bethesda the company who allocated the fund towards atom shop content yet neglected or completely skipped the QA testing most games of any decent quality let alone triple a quality should have. Then had the gall to put micro transactions in a game of such low quality for the price. Then continued to fund and produce atom shop content while clearly not properly funding the departments who are needed to fix games and produce any actually playable content for the game. That is what I am mad at. It seems the fiance team has taken complete control over Bethesda and it shows. The people who are doing the game modeling/landscaping are incredibly talented but I wish there was more story to go with that amazing visuals. I simply expected more from Bethesda that is all.
---
I've only made one attempt. Got stuck at the part where you repair the cores. Any advice?
---
How is it cashgrabbing if they literally hand you in game currency for doing so much as leveling up? Or killing 10 creatures. I mean I get some of the hate for the game itself but I feel like people are just fishing for issues to bitch about.
---
A bland moment in a bland game nothing to rave about 
---
I dropped a legendary fat man and mutant super sledge in the cigarette dispenser at WS station.  Watago station blue suitcase or blue lunch pail are my other common drops. 
---
make sure you dont scrap a cop cap with a red band around it, thats rare.
---
if you need a responders paramedic to scrap, start a new character, run to overseers camp then flatwoods, do the responders quest until you get a paramedic outfit. Should take 10-15 mins with that low AP.
---
What's so good about cranberry relish? I know the cobbler gives bonus xp which is good
---
Did you filter the list? You can filter the lost of mods to what you can build right now.
---
That's my only guess.
---
thats a lot of words to say 'im to lazy to look up the patch notes and wanted to tell everyone'
---
I can't decide it that's cute or silly.
---
Either way, you do you
---
10% bonus xp for 1 hr. Extra 5% xp over the cobbler.
---
If you exit the station and go back in would it still be filtered 
---
Ah thats also a really good change.
---
thnx but im keeping the laser
---
Those lazy greedy...  Eh, I could go for a solid 12 hours, *I'm tired*...
---
Find another toad and it will fix. I fixed my 10% like this.
---
Problem with cannibal is you either have to take lead belly or chug radaway.
---
The rad penalty is insane.
---
Not to mention if you want it to heal as much as dog food you have to get rank 3.
---
So the ideal cannibal setup with lead belly is 6 points as opposed 1 for good doggy.
---
interesting
---
It's a very distinct outfit in game, with great personality. Glorf's a colourful cutie.
---
I posted this yesterday and got called a greasy YouTube addict lol.
---
The email they sent me says that I violated their rules by having 100k+ of unique items and that I can have my account back after they roll their patch out. I am trying to get them to actually login to my account and see for themselves that the automatically flagged ban was a mistake on their end.
---
I had to scrap my police uniform for it! I know I'll find another though.
---
They are in quite a few places but I struggle to remember where right now. I'd guess the prison?
---
My bad, I'll edit it in this reply. I'm too lazy to look up the patch notes and wanted all my senpai to acknowledge me. 
---
It's about eating people
---
There is a very specific way to to it. Generator-switch-power conduit(on wall). Then separate gen-wall(door).
---
Wandered by it aimlessly it is haha! Thank you 
---
spin it topwise
---
So just double checking here.
---
1 You read the plans for the T-51 motion assist (the plans aren't in your inventory anymore), or have the actual mod item.
---
2 You placed the power armor frame in the station and it has a T-51 torso on it.
---
3 you are on the modify screen and selected the T-51 toros
---
And still nothing show up? is so you ran into some bug, or something else is wrong as if those conditions are met you should at least be able to see the mod and what materials are required to add it. 
---
Oh you mean the glowing legendary 3 Star deathclaw I dropped today at WS during a nuke run?  The one I blasted from on top of the bus and it disappeared with no loot drop?   Thanks Bethesda.  Not the first time but for fucks sake. 
---
Don‚Äôt forget that flux stacks with deteriorated flux you already have. If you make a stack or two and have one left over and farm the next day? Guess what, that whole stack is going to disappear in 30 minutes because it took on the condition of the lowest one.
---
Basically. Stand about 50 metres south-east of Slocum Joes. Draw a boundary north from here, stopping just over the river, now draw another one west from our initial point, again stopping just over the river, with the river itself connecting them. (So you have defined a 3-sided shape with slocum joes in the corner) This broad area has perhaps 20/25 Firecaps in.
---
Dude chill, you're not banned. There's some server side problems today. If you were banned they send you message.
---
This may sound stupid, but do you have the gunsmith rank to actually make the suppressor mod?
---
The reason I ask is because my melee alt has WAY more melee weapon mods available that he learned through scrapping, that I think is based on a rank 5 makeshift warrior card.  My main sniper with 5 ranks of gunsmith easily learns gun-related mods, but it takes forever to unlock melee and armor mods.
---
I briefly experimented by making a bunch of combat armor with rank 3 Armorer/Scrapper/Super Duper equipped, and aside from making a ton more armor at a lower base cost, I think I learned 70% of the available mods in one sitting.  I think I made somewhere around 30 of each legs/arms/chest, but it doesn't seem to matter because I learned asbestos lining from a leg piece, and somehow have muffled available on my arm pieces now.  I thought that mod was legs only.
---
I‚Äôve yet to see a wild chicken.  
---
no longer play FO76 sorry, Im all about Anthem now.
---
1. That is correct.
---
2. It has all the armour on it not just torso
---
3. Yes
---
I have it painted if that matters
---
Cigarette dispenser ... not seen someone use that before - I‚Äôll make sure to check it and use it. What about the register inside or any of the containers in the station itself?
---
Correct.  Saw all of them today in between the golf club and the resort.  Radscorpion is by far the worst of that group.  
---
If you're going melee then you want unyielding armor, preferably with sentinel or cavalier as I've seen explained to you already. A full set of unyielding gives you +15 to every stat except for endurance if you're low enough health.. this works best with a weapon that is bloodied, I keep both a bloodied power fist with power attack damage +1 end for when I'm out of power armor, and a supersledge or Sledge with bloodied and swing speed- even though my strength is only a base of 7, with my shielded vault 76 under armor(+2str if I remember right), my +5 strength from the high radiation I use to keep my health low with the radicool perk, that's 14 strength before the 15 from full unyielding armor, bringing me to 29 strength without it being my main build. That's enough for several points in melee or two handed weapon perks with swing speed and weight reduction or shotguns and minimal points.
---
Or, if you go full strength you're talking 8 points higher, so 37 strength.. a bit Overkill in any situation to be honest, with the bloodied effect and adrenal reaction and twisted muscles for melee weapons or talons for unarmed weapons, you're a god among men.
---
When we would nuke to just miss the prime site, keeping the queen outside the radiation zone, each power attack with my power fist would do massive damage.. just be aware this build requires the cards to lock mutations and reduce negative effects, perhaps 1 point in strange in numbers along with a teammate that has a mutation as well, and enough points in agility for dodgy, action boy/girl to replenish action points used by dodgy, serendipity in luck to completely ignore 45% of all damage when under 30% health, and 3 points blocker in strength to reduce melee damage by 45%- all of this is what makes the low health build outside of power armor so great, if you can get sentinels or cavalier you're completely bullet proof, literally.
---
You don't need assassin's with this build, if you get full sentinel or cavalier with the other perks I've mentioned you will not take damage while moving or standing still depending which you've gotten. You can even run a mixed set with 3 of one and 2 of the other as a perfect blend in pve and near invulnerability when attacked by another player.
---
My tse handmade disappeared out of my hands and inventory during this fight... Wtf 
---
I‚Äôve spawned into my camp area, got the message that my camp can‚Äôt be placed, even though there is nothing there. Just started happening recently. 
---
They probably won't because that'll increase the amount of items needed in a cell to render and keep track of, thus lower performance both in server and on client side.  It only worked in the former Fallouts as it was single player.  I could see it being added to say, private servers, but it probably wouldn't work all that well in a public server.  Imagine even 1 base on the server with 10,000 gnomes set up around it (and you know someone would definitely do that lol).  The server would lag, and you would have difficulty loading that specific cell once you got close enough.  They could index it to the base size, but then you probably wouldn't be able to place that much.
---
Do you know where they drop handmades or levers??
---
pretty sure ammo bags have this. there are a few scattered around camp mcclintock. worth going just for the springs in the main building but i'm pretty sure the barracks might have a few ammo bags and theres usually one or two in the main building in the lockers. 
---
[removed]
---
You still get a pack every 5 levels. Just no more special points after 50
---
‚ÄúChoppin‚Äô‚Äù. And suddenly bi.
---
I have spare plans for a whole set on PC if anyone's interested I can hook you up :)
---
I mean theoretically there could be a limit on the type, amount, and location of each item, but that does seem like quite a bit of work 
---
I accidentally ran over one (pain train) in the south Savage Divide last night. Was in the middle of the road. Go fig. 
---
Oh nice, thanks for the tip!
---
I bought the plans
---
I‚Äôm confused I‚Äôve scrapped several dozen handmades over the last 3 months and I still don‚Äôt have hardened Rex and suppressor on my level 130 character what am I doing wrong ?
---
Yeah I have weight reduction on every piece of my armour. Weapons, jump, food, chems, everything.
---
I get in power armour and my weight goes up 100lbs! I use excavator as my taxi back to camp though.
---
Allow us to Equip a perk card to stash boxes. you cannot remove the card if stash limit would be exceeded without the card. putting that card in your stash locks you out of using on your character. so put a rank 2 traveling pharmacy, can only use rank 1 or 3 for yourself
---
&gt;!i guess everyone would use pack rat for it!&lt;
---
I'm pretty sure I read that Sony caved and does allow cross platform but the decision came too late to have it at launch. I think Bethesda has said it's a feature they're interested in implementing. 
---
The queen stopped taking damage, that was bollocks!
---
I pumped over 400 shotgun shells &amp; 200 2mm EC's into her!
---
Medical Wing in the Enclave bunker, they sell all the recipes for drugs!
---
It's a bit more hardcore on the pvp stuff . Like when someone kills you they'll usually take all armor weapons ammo and aid you have had. A few caps and what junk I'm prob not carrying isnt a huge loss for me after playin games like Ark
---
It‚Äôs a trap!
---
Xbox or ps4 get a bigger tv
---
All sorts of shenanigans where a foot I'm bummed about my gun 
---
Fruit &gt; Veggies
---
fruit works with Carnivore (only tested with Blackberries and Mutfruit)
---
the paint shouldn't matter, only thing I can think of is the plan didn't unlock the correct one for you. I know several items a while back were doing that. You could try checking the Vendor Bot phoenix in Watoga as it the plans for 45/51/60 IIRC and you can see if it lists it as learned or not.
---
Ya i honestly just hate losing the caps. Im greedy lol
---
I keep having issues with people trying to melee me while I‚Äôm sorting through drops. Unfortunately, I have the ‚ÄúReactive Plates‚Äù and they keep killing themselves leaving me with a bounty that was not of my doing. I usually end up stashing all my loot and stripping all my armor off and just taking a knee in an open space. Obnoxious.
---
I've seen it listed there and next to it it says "(Known)"
---
Was it worth it ? I‚Äôm cap starved on my level 67 and I keep thinking I shouldn‚Äôt buy it and save for calibrated shocks or a jet pack instead .
---
Yeah, that really sucked. Thanks anyway.
---
+karma
---
From memory... no. Sorry!
---
Its ok
---
I never minded the rad penalty. Also, the health boost from cannibal is like a diluted stim pack
---
Frogs are a source of Uranium did you know? Have run into (and over, thanks to Pain Train perk) chicken, squirrel  a single friendly dog on top of cliffs near swampland (the mire?) as well.
---
Bloodied effect is so strong due to it stacking with Adrenal reactio (mutation) and every perk that procks with low HP. like nerd rage
---
Excavators are from the region at the bottom left part of the map, doing events and claiming workshops give you a chance of receiving mods and plans. Just like raider plans in the Savage Divide, or t60 I‚Äôm the cranberry bog. 
---
No problem. It also annoys me that one leg rattles. I hope they vary the noises up at some point.
---
Haha! I was going to says the same thing! Grew up there too
---
Yeah, used to love moving dead guys around 
---
Put a switch on the inside just like you did on the outside i have a foot switch on the outside and the inside. run your power to the switch and than from the switch to the door on both sides. works great
---
And she was flying all the way to the other side of the blast zone, wtf......
---
There's a handmade rifle that spawns in the open on a metal shelf on top of a building at the very north end of Berkeley Springs.  You can get at least one a day.  If you don't see it, someone else grabbed it.  Just server hop and try again.  The handmade plan is nice, but making even a lvl 15 handmade is kinda expensive for the craft-n-scrap method.  Before the update that made vendors more reliably drop plans, I just went there once or twice a play session, scrapped the handmade and have all the mods except for an aligned long barrel.  I prefer the true barrel and stock, so it's no big deal for me.
---
Idk. That was F'd. Thanks for trying. 
---
You can repair while in edit mode without having to store/replace. Can't remember the control but it is a thing you can do
---
i think you need to put an extra floor on the outside then remove it after you placed that wall.
---
What kind of armour do you use and which perks? I really want to be a non-PA player but with my normal armour simply cannot stand against  mobs
---
It's worth deciphering one time just to see how complicated it is. After that you're going to want to grab the codes from the internet. nukacrypt.com

Go on market subs ask for plan someone will sell it around 700 instead of the 1850 
---
No problem. A tip for lower levels is there is 10 cranberries in the field below Aaronholt Homestead in the northern forest. With green thumb and good with salt  lvl 1 (good for leveling even if not in your final build and relish won't expire) you'll get enough relish for 10 hours of bonus xp. Gourds can be planted in your camp and snap tail reeds are plentiful if you just got flatwoods and follow the river northeast. 
---
The recipe can be found around the forest or just purchased from the chef in Whitespring (may need to server hop a few times).
---
I got an email that flat out said I‚Äôm banned until next patch. 
---
Awesome idea ! I actually have both a dirty cap and a clean one ( red band )
---
IT WORKED!!! THANKS SO MUCH!
---
Entirely my goal. Its much more fun if you aren't constantly trying to manage your inventory. I spent most of levels 300-400 farming my ass off for scrap. Im pretty aware of almost all locations for heaps of raw scrap, so I can ignore most mob loot and just farm farm farm. I still go to every work bench to scrap stuff out of habit.
---
When the trade window opens you can select things from your inventory band set a price, and go through the other person's inventory to see if they've set a price on something they want to sell you.
---
I can't help you with setting up your mic, sorry.
---
If you friend someone they will be under "friends" on your social tab. You can see when they are playing and join their server, or they can join yours. You can only party up with people on the same server as you, but the friends list makes that easy. 
---
What platform are you on. You can put a pressure pad inside so when you step on it to walk out, it opens. If you want to hook the pressure pad to the door power point on the other side, you can do like this.
---
Place welcome mat on the ground, place pressure pad on-top of mat. Make sure it's lined up so when you pick up the mat, it picks up the pressure pad also. Connect power to it, move the mat/p-pad just slightly 1 time, now you can move them both anywhere, having power lines run through walls
---
Wut
---
There's an inaccessible truck at Robco that has a bench inside, if you face it the right way you can sit down and pop inside of it. There's a button inside but it doesn't do anything and you have to fast travel/log out because there's no way of getting out lol.
---
When farming Whitesprings, I always drop my extra loot in the ice cooler right outside of the golf clubhouse.
---
Another suspicious account giving the game a hyperbolic praise. Created around Fallout 76 launch, hoarding Karma since then. 
---
With all due respect, seems like a corporate shill account.
---
Well really grew up in Frankfort but you know. lol
---
First, welcome!
---
Second, your options menu should have settings for when the mic is on / off / etc. You have to set it there, I suspect the PC version doesn‚Äôt have a push-to-talk button. If you have it set to ‚Äútalk in near area‚Äù when you talk, people near by will hear you (friend, team or not)
---
Third, really w/o sound the best you have are the emote wheel (yes, no, follow, oh crap, etc.) I play on PS4, so my experience may be different. The vast majority of interactions I‚Äôve had (high and low level) have been helpful. You do find some boneheads and you do find some who are trying to role play as raiders. I generally ignore the second unless I‚Äôm feeling like some back and forth, and either ignore or shut down the bonehead jerks. Generally though, that is the exception - most people are decent.
---
If I wanted to budget my int, I‚Äôd want no less than 4, I‚Äôd need 3 for repairing equipment, and always want the chemist perk, most perks go up to 3 levels. 
---
Ah, Bethesda Bug Whackamole.  My favorite line of side quests. 
---
Where did you place it? Outside Charleston station?
---
You didn't mention that in your post. Can we see a screenshot of the email? I bunch of people have been saying this today, but nobody seems to be able to provide the email.
---
Yes, I will upload a screenshot 
---
I never got a message saying I was banned until I went back and forth with support. I asked them for a lost of items that I apparently had that much of and they have yet to reply to me. 
---
Hunter/hunted maybe?
---
On the side of the big bridge near cow spots creamery, there‚Äôs a locked door that can only be unlocked with a key found on a roller coaster at Camden park. Behind it, there‚Äôs most of a set of raider power armor with a 30-100% core, and on the door directly to your right after you enter, there‚Äôs one on a shelf at 50%. Server hopping they‚Äôre always there.
---
Thanks for sharing. I started playing on Xbox during the BETA with a full team, and despite the stability issues and few quests that weren‚Äôt working, we mostly beat the game together and I‚Äôm the only one still playing today. It became stagnant for me for a while, but I can imagine that playing through the game for newcomers now is much better and that the game is in a good place right now as far as stability and game-breaking glitches is concerned. Some glitches I always found charming aside from the ones that prevented me from progressing through quests properly. I can honestly say I‚Äôve been having the most fun in this game in the past week or two than I have since the team days. 
---
Last week I met a rando at watoga station who flagged me down wanting to trade. We requested a couple items and eventually I just ended the trade and dropped the ghoul killers explosive shot assault rifle I didn‚Äôt really want. He proceeds to drop a 2-shot black powder pistol and several decent legendary melee weapons, and I picked and chose the ones I wanted and jumped around with heart emotes to show appreciation and signal that he could pick the remaining weapons back up to sell or whatever. We ended up teaming up and walking off towards fissure site prime, taking down 5 scorchbeasts along the way. 
---
We then make a run through the glassed cavern and celebrated our luck before I had to sign off. It was a super positive interaction that caused us both to profit that was sparked by neither of us being greedy with our trade. Be excellent to each other out there!
---
Yeah the game needs In-game factions.
---
Like for Honor. Daily rewards for the better faction between raiders enclave responders and BoS.
---
I think i saw in a ITV that the devs are planning to introduce this kind of system and honestly i'm really waiting this beyond everything
---
Anybody on Xbox willing to join my game and party to help me
---
I drop lower stuff at the Overseer‚Äôs camp
---
North of Watoga.   Just on the other side of the river from the little covered picnic tables.  Literally spent 2 months in Watoga grinding, overencumbered and respawning many times a day with no conflicts.  Now today, a dozen attempts and the spot is taken in every server....   doesn‚Äôt add up.    
---
I get it if you want to complete the set, but I learned on here that quite a few people (and now me, on two different characters) use the XO1 ... but T60 legs. The shocks are easier to find, they are SO FREAKING MUCH CHEAPER TO REPAIR.
---
Anyway, I still look as well when I make the vendor rounds - but in the mean time, I‚Äôm using the T60s.
---
definitely is a thing. i use an 3* instigating ski sword currently and am a happy man
---
Seriously, I'm at work right now, ill dig up the video evidence as soon as I have a free minute
---
Yeah that seems like it shouldn‚Äôt be constantly taken. Did you have anyone else build something in your camp?
---
Non-PA is also the only way you can really do the punching builds (death claw, mole miner gauntlet, tambo, etc.). 
---
Totally workable.
---
You have to go anti clockwise on the wiring, and top bottomiddle. In that order
---
Did you check to see if it's plugged in?
---
I mean...I love me some delicious soap, American or British flavored. 
---
But in prestige levels for ways to waste time, it‚Äôs a bit of a lateral move from video games. Hers is equally geeky, but often involves boxed wine. So that‚Äôs a plus.
---
I saw my first chicken last week, it was all plucked. I have yet to see a rabbit though
---
I‚Äôve yet to see them, unlike other plans I have no idea what events/workshops are part of its drop pool. 
---
I swear, i'm lvl 120 and never found a single sentinel armor or a cavalier one.. are they so much rare in this game??
---
Another vote for the blue suitcase, either at Watoga Station or Pleasant Valley -- lot of midlevel players frequent PV station b/c of its central location. 
---

This is the original response from them. I responded that there is no way this is accurate and that I would like them to login my account and see for themselves. They responded with the same original response.
---
Oh, I hear you. Too much needles damage and grinding 
---
pretty much sums of the state of this game lol. if this is what youre wanting out of a video game then its for you. lol
---
Yes I know. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm suggesting a system to use them.....
---
I loved the Fallout 4 mod that gave you the Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack!
---
Thanks guys so much, I had it filtered, sorry to waste your time
---
So you didn‚Äôt understand the question? Or did you miss the part about a guaranteed plan spawn at Rollins Work Camp?
---
If it is broken you can. I have many parts of my camp damaged but not broken. 
---
No I've been able to repair damaged walls
---
Love this post. This sub needs more stories like these.
---
I‚Äôll share one from last night. I mostly play 76 with my old buddy George. We go way back playing co op games together for the last 15 years. We‚Äôre both fucked up &amp; demented, so we usually like to do stupid shit... like the first flying SB we killed together both wearing clown suits. First pic was George teabagging a dead super mutant while I stood in the background in my underwear. I fucking love playing co op with George. 76 actually got us back to playing together after more than 2 years.
---
Anyways, what happened yesterday. George and I were farming at a nuked whitesprings. For some reason he had never gone by the strip of homes to slay the many radiated ghouls. So I bring him over there and like 30 radiated ghouls come running outa the homes and George yells, ‚ÄúFucking balls‚Äù. So we‚Äôre running in circles around the houses herding these ghouls and they won‚Äôt stop coming. We‚Äôre on a serious murder train until all of our weapons start breaking. We‚Äôre down to nothing. George goes, ‚Äúthe fuck we gonna use now? Fucking throw our bottle caps at them???‚Äù I respond, ‚Äúgot any land mines?‚Äù. He says ‚Äútons‚Äù. I say ‚Äúyeah, me too. Let‚Äôs lighten the load.‚Äù 
---
So we start running backwards dropping landmine after landmine. Ghoul bodies flying everywhere while we‚Äôre cursing like sailors and running backwards. For a while I think I hear distant laughter. I think to myself ‚Äúdamn, this must look insane from a distance.‚Äù Then sure enough when we make the next loop around the block with ghouls rocketing through the air, I see them. A group of 5 dudes watching George and I playing ring around the rosie from a distance. None of them moving, just watching. So after our last ghoul goes shooting into the sky, we go over to meet our observers. They we‚Äôre all laughing their asses off saying that they‚Äôd been watching &amp; listening for ten minutes and it was the funniest thing they‚Äôd seen all week. 
---
I love this fucking game too.
---
I wonder if you can get the bos vendor and Watoga train station to fight... different factions and all
---
Ok guys I am on Xbox o think Bethesda needs to make a more simple way to do this instead of a complex tedious work around to be quite frankly honest 
---
ps4?
---
I uninstalled it. 
---
Dude this game sucks. Forced to play hardcore mode, nothing but bullies destroying your stuff and killing you with op weapons they are not supposed to even be able to use at lever 7 yet, you have to eat and drink every 5 minutes or you cant do anything, they nerfed all the decent weapons so now one guy can not kill a scorchbeast unless you use all your ammo and already have great weapons or a team, the game lags and servers kick you out constantly, you'll have all the required materials to repair something but the game wont let you until you have roughly double the materials needed, the perk system sucks and is too limited, and everyone you see in the server tries to kill you and destroy your camp just to bully others online cause they are suck losers they cant do it in real life. Iv okayed fallout sense the start but online only games suck period. 
---
It would be nice for sure, but it‚Äôs never going to happen. 
---
Perma beta playin a perma beta game
---
Because typically anyone who does pvp has assasin sintinal or cav armor and pvp is stacked against the non agresser typically
---
The list of crossplay games is actually growing in case you're not seeing it listed by websites trying to make Sony appear completely unwilling. https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/all-cross-platform-games/amp/
---
Sure, there's only 2 games that are cross play on all platforms, but if you keep looking you'll see a much larger selection of games with PS4 listed.
---
I imagine that an issue with the developers making the headlines are mainly the ones trying to implement crossplay at launch: that really could hurt PS4 game sales, I can see why they're not jumping to include it from launch on Sony's platform.
---
I think overall they'll come around in the end, but it's still up to developers like Bethesda to implement it if it's made available.
---
Honestly with the loss of players in fallout's player base they may need to do this in the end..
---
My best was in the beta. 
---
I was maybe lvl 10~ and i came across a Workshop. Didnt know what it was and i saw like 15 ghouls slapping a turret. So i think ‚Äúeasy xp!‚Äù And throw a nade. Well, is was occupied and i got a bounty. So i dipped out and started building my camp. 
---
As i was building i got the Marsupial mutation and didnt want to get rid of it. There‚Äôs rhe 5 minute Countdown for the server to shut down. So there i am, half health and building my camp when out of nowhere a lvl 20 starts shooting me! I turn around jump around and pop 3 shots in him. Dead, run over loot his junk. 
---
30 seconds: decide to teabag him for lulz then deposited my junk. Server shuts down. Later i get a message ‚Äúdid you ever kill that guy you were hunting?‚Äù
---
So i replied ‚Äúnah, i was the hunted that killed the hunter. If you message him tell him not to quit the game (lol).‚Äù
---
Proudest moment of gaming. And my roommate saw the whole thing unfold. It. Was. Awesome. 
---
Wanting to use a character you leveled and geared up in relative safety reeks of casual carebear fyi.
---
Man I dont wanna some dim witted or anything, but I gotta spell this out to you and see if its right. Second account on same console with second build. Hit pause and load second game with second build on second account on same console and trade some shit. What kind of fuckery is this? Am i getting this or am I as stupid as I feel?
---
I've found one, still need a second. Already found jet pack twice. 
---
No you haven't 
---
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **1st Cakeday** Wolf-Legion! ^(hug)
---
Pretty much. Most people are doing PVE. If you want to PVP, they assume you‚Äôre probably spec‚Äôd for that - and they aren‚Äôt - so why f-ing bother?
---
That‚Äôs pretty harsh man, I‚Äôm just trying to be helpful. I have no idea about garenteed drops anywhere.  For anything. However, some of the excavator mods don‚Äôt show indications for what power armor they are for until you get to the power armor workbench. 
---
Also theres pretty much 0 incentive. Pvp is probably my favorite part of this game, but whats the point? The caps, a bit of loot MAYBE.
---
Yes 
---
At your lesure then
---
Same here, used to pop up all the time. Now neither the gun or armor one pops up anymore. Finally I just unequipped the cards. Heard other people complaining about this too
---
You willing to sell it?
---
The perk your looking for is called NOT LAZY, and is already in the game.  
---
Just store each damaged item and then replace them from the stored items menu.  Problem solved.
---
Storing and placing items to repair them is an exploit not a feature 
---
I found a raw piece and that‚Äôs about it.  
---
Spin the middle side topwise. Topwise!
---
On ps4 turn on the zoom in function in settings then press ps button and square
---
I don't play all to often but when I do its always cool to see the new players. I've even built my camp near flatwoods across the gas station just to meet the new guys
---
Just respawn, kill ghouls, pick up junk...game-breaking glitch gone. Or relog and carry on as before.
---
People seem to not know what "game-breaking" means. 
---
Agree, I have a vision disability and the had written notes are impossible for me to read on PlayStation.  Even with the magnification from accessibility menu, I cane barely read pencil writing on paper.
---
On OC they can change the font of the text making it easy to read.  Wish they would make all text like they did in Skyrim, white letters on black background.  Oh well sux to be me I guess.  Reminds me, I need to call a lawyer about accessibility issues in a game like this. ;)
---
I‚Äôve learned to completely finish building and furnishing BEFORE adding turrets... on a side note: I really wish spotlights would cost less budget. 
---
I feel it may be the same thing as when a player enters a new building, and all of the items that you can pick up spawn?
---
It's "Vendor at the Vatoga"...
---
Same here
---
Yeah, there's that.
---
There's also the fact that the series has always been single-player.  The fanbase leads toward solo play anyway.  
---
This game has shitty pvp, so mist ppl don't bother. 
---
Hmmm, interesting point, but no.   
---
Phoenix is just a BoS diehard, he tells the other bots to join BoS or die!
---
what everyone else said. legendaries, slap mechanics. you can somewhat even the grounds with melee, stealth boy and/or PA, but you're still at a large disadvantage. not to mention the other party could be using exploits.
---
when pvp servers hit it won't be much different. except campers are going to be the bane of everyone.
---
One of the vendor bots has excavator mod plans. I think Grafton from memory? That‚Äôs guaranteed drop. 
---
I just turn on can do and hit all the trash cans in whitesprings and the enclave bunker. You get a decent amount of unperishable food that way
---
Stop huffing the glue mate
---
LOL.  I get stupidly overconfident in power armor with my melee build.  My pal and I are passing by the Mountainside bed and breakfast in the south/central part of the map and I'm like "hey, I've had good luck with 3star yao-guai spawning on the tracks down there".  We make a little detour on our way to R&amp;G Station and an epic battle ensues.
---
The two yao-guai are there, plain old lvl 50+ critters that are dispatched without too much issue, then there's more as we come up the hill heading south, including a 3-star green fire lvl 79 version and two back-up pals that are lvl 50+.  My friend is a stealth build, so I proudly prance up to them with my lvl 95 alt in my T-51 suit and 3 ranks of blocker perk with my mutants/faster swing fire axe to grab aggro and fail to notice that I'm getting annihilated until my audio goes quiet and I can hear my heartbeat.  She's like "hey Shank you might want to..." and I die while being perma-staggered by the remaining two.  Not just get incapacitated, but outright dead.  She starts laughing at me for being an idiot, until a second later when she realizes that they're all running on her now (with the legendary back to full health)  I realize I didn't run close enough to the BnB to unlock the location, respawn at The Vantage, and fast travel to her dot as quickly as I can.  She gets smoked, and I take out the non-legendary bear teabagging her corpse.  I'm trying not to kill the legendary before she can get back into the first, because sometimes loot gets squirrely.  I'm just skirting the ring, blocking the attacks and still taking some hard heavyweight shots, resort to eating a stimpak until I see some 'splodes hitting the beast in the rear and my buddy says she's back.  We take it out together and are "rewarded" with a \*\* nocturnal/blocking Grognak axe and a \* troubleshooter's raider chest piece, respectively.  Oh well.  It'll be a good laugh later on when we see another yao-guai and have a "remember when" moment.
---
Thank you for the advice!!
---
I thought part one and 2 were combined for this one.
---
Keep your negative attitude to yourself and everyone will be happier.
---
Any word on what the 4:8:2000 error is all about that is plaguing the servers?
---
If you don‚Äôt know how to set up your mic, you can IM then but it will kill you through time delay if you are both in a fight (no pause). 
---
I had a lower level person ask for team and help three nights ago. Always happy to help, But you can‚Äôt just use the emoji to follow and not expect to explain why, especially if you‚Äôre in one location and want to go somewhere else. This person didn‚Äôt have a mic so I had to IM them to find out what they wanted. It would have been courteous of them to start the talking first so that I knew what they wanted to do. 
---
I uNiNsTaLlEd It
---
Any word on what the 4:8:2000 error is all about that is plaguing the Fallout 76 servers?
---
Not kinda. We went from actually cool and interesting 3 player queues to personality less islands , a battleground simulator raid size scenario with literally no differing outcome or battle, a boss that has no reason for existing.
---
Nothing in it has any reason for existing. Returning players were dumped into a point with no explanation why under city is under attack and no access to the precursory situations via the gameplay. The design of it for the timeline makes zero sense. 
---
All the fun and interesting options were pruned and squished out of the game, every good thing the game had post cataclysm were put on a shelf like Welp, that was amazing and the players loved the gameplay and potential for even better and more epic followups, so let's NEVER EVER repeat any of this and also prune out the aspects they enjoyed. That will keep them coming back to buying 3 month subs to play 4 days during the duration twice a year!
---
It doesn't make sense to me how they started with an epic high challenge mode class story / unlock and went down to meaningless, challengeless imitations of that to acquire weapons for the next release instead of making more good class story challenges, and also delete 90% of what players unlocked with the original test of concept, delete an entire spec style without replacing it in a meaningful way honoring the playstyle. It felt like the design got handed to completely separate idea people who had no understanding of what was fun and cool, who just smashed a delete button like hey we don't need a casting magic user with mid range hybrid melee utility, why would we need that, magic = stand still and watch a casting bar to attack from far away! Because DEMON HUNTERS!!!!!111
---
Not kinda. 
---
It's A piece of charred waste vomited out by the weak afterthought that preceded it, like what dimension they time walked to, is this a nightmare suspended on the timeless isle? 76 is so fun and brilliant compared to these faceplanfs that blizzard made after somehow forgetting what constitutes the classic excellence of its gameplay sometime round about when the voice the allowed them to cancel titan exited and all similar voices of reason somehow
---
Followed. 
---
If they ever release a game capitalizing on the richness of overwatch that isn't sports and pvp (like how diablo came thru and just went BAM look at this basically new genre of game) I'll know they've righted this course. There has never been a wow killer, it's its own killer here.  The follow up to wow could and should be a co op game to end all... but Blizzard Forgot. 
---
I'll most likely be on at around the same time tomorrow if you wanna go for it again?
---
I didn‚Äôt know people still unironically believe their console is superior , like chill Xbox and PlayStation are basically the same.
---
üñï
---
LOL so many downvoted
---
Had 3 guys break down my door to get inside and sed what was in there.  Meanwhile I got a full set of publicly available areas with crafting stations.
---
The bounty caps for vengeance were sweet.  And then I kept getting them to initiate PVP and getting additional sstisfaction... and caps
---
I'm on ps4. Today I have this issue as well. Are they just holding everyone hostage until next patch?!?!
---
Xbox one dropping now 
---
What is it? Can you only learn a certain amount of blueprints?
---
Free caps? Don't look a gift cap in the mouth?
---
no, it doesn't
---
If you don't have a decent legendary handmade or level action, you don't really need the plans either. Plus you need a lot of resources to craft the weapons to unlock the mods. Level actions drop fairly little, handmades drop every now and then.
---
So you should spare your caps for thing that are more use NOW.
---
Whenever I see "visit the giant teapot", I always swing by my CAMP to pick up 10 honey on my way there!
---
Does this mean I should remove my locks?

Nope

---
How sweet
---
For sale?!  Hehe üòú 
---
Just fyi that has never been confirmed and certainly doesn't seem that way from my experience. Doesn't hurt to try just thought you should know it's basically just a tinfoil hat theory at the end of the day.
---
Cause PVP isn't any fun. It's slap damage then who one-shot who first. So the only people who bother with PVP are running super specfic builds. Thus the 99% of the player base who don't build for PVP are safe to assume anyone who tries to PVP them will just one-hit insta-kill them if they slap back, why likely being almost invincible due to PVP specfic armour.
---
I would drop my camp near your camp, get one of my friends to join the server, then logout and rejoin the server your camp is on.  Then before your camp can finish loading in for me, I would run into your camp's location.
---
Should you have built a trap base, I would then proceed to deploy artillery, 5, or 6 
---
, and throw a smoke grenade on your roof.  Shells will go right through the concrete foundations and WRECK YER SHIT.
---
In your opinion is the TSE handmade a must have end game weapon? I‚Äôm starting to notice that very few guns are here are worth it for the  end game , assault rifles are to heavy combat rifles are about the same and I‚Äôve yet to see a decent laser rifle! Is alit all about handmades and shotties?
---
Only place I see that's useful is West Tec.
---
Thanks for that though, cus I only went there once when I was a lower level and was getting destroyed. I then forgot about it.
---
No it‚Äôs like the build budget but way smaller.  So if you have a huge build you cannot save it :(
---
Depends on your build. If you use rifles like the combat rifle already than yes you definitely should invest in the plan. If you don't I wouldn't bother, just run the prison event whenever you notice it and you might get it for free.
---
Oh, that kind of blueprint. I was thinking of plans. Not hat big of a problem. I‚Äôve been thinking of loving to the Savage Divide and when I do I will completely redo my camp. 
---
Prob got thrown into the atmosphere by a car explosion as do so many of my legendary kills for some reason. I like this game a lot, but that is one of my biggest pet peeves.
---
Everyone else I know is logging in fine though ? And where do they send it?
---
What system you on? I could make you one. 
---
It‚Äôs also a plan. 
---
It's fun under the right conditions, which isn't often for the reasons everyone else has said. So people don't do it often.
---
Yea I just built a 3 story check point.  Kinda bummed I can‚Äôt spawn it....just the first floor.
---
I bought the 6 month dreadship thing thinking I was going to play BFA for a long long time. I felt really betrayed by that purchase. About a month after I was 6/8 mythic uldir and was just completely bored. I was 385 ilvl and heart level 30 while others where 375 and 26 hearts. I went way too hard in a terribly content lacking game that wasn't really fun to play.
---
I'm waiting for blizzard to destroy hearthstone, thats the last thing for me. Its PvE modes are incredibly fun with ridiculous replayability. It's usually what I play if I'm out of the house or in bed.
---
It's just rng, hardened was one of the first ones I got still don't have suppressor.
---
I'm on PC. You can open 2 clients if you open it from the .exe
---
To do the same on console I think you need 2 consoles, but I haven't owned a console since 2008.

[Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uIrnEIuL8o&amp;t) where the guy actually calls to a PR company that offer "shill services" and also interview a Reddit moderator about the theme.

It's pretty widespread, now and then there's an AMA of professional shills [like this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/7ja6de/ive_been_a_corporate_shill_on_reddit_and_on_other/).
---
EDIT: [Here's a massive thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/) of journalistic articles (from NY Times and such) about shilling.
---
How's it working out? They haven't even answered me. And yeah I don't even have that many items in total LOL. On my low level alt account I store stimpaks there because once I got the recipe I went ham crafting them by farming tics. But it's like 400..lol but that doesn't even come close to 1,000, let alone 100,000. 
---
And when is this supposed patch coming out?
---
It's just random. You've not scrapped enough. If you haven't crafted handmades, it takes quite long since they don't drop as loot so much.
---
If you like farming resources you could craft them. If you dont but you have good handmade you could consider just asking some trader to mod it for you. A lot of people have handmades fully unlocked.
---
It's been here a while. Generally speaking, I just save the most important pieces - more minor pieces I can place if I ever move camp.
---
Well the other guy on my post got the same message  when trying to log in and actually had to submit a ticket to find out he was suspended. Perhaps they don't bother with suspensions. 
---
I guess you need to start a support ticket as per the two other users that I've talked to here. Sorry man, I didn't realize. I thought this was just another rumor flying around.
---
One thing I‚Äôve noticed when searching for plastic at the known hotspots (the high schools, white springs, etc.) if another player has already picked over a location on your current server you won‚Äôt find what you‚Äôre looking for or it will be very picked over. Does the plastic containing items/junk ever respawn or does one have to server hop to get what you‚Äôre looking for if it appears someone has already beat you to a particular location and cleaned it out? 
---
Oh man! My first encounter with a random player was very similar. I saw a guy running going "Shit shit shit shit" and because Ugandan Knuckles was big atm I chased after him going "why are you running? Do you not kno da wae?"
---
He said in a panic: "it's a Deathclaw and I'm level 6!"  to which I replied "what Death- AHHHHH!!!! SHOOT IT SHOOT IT-!"
---
To confirm it doesn't matter what armor piece or level you scrap you will learn mods for all the different pieces in that set. So make the cheapest one you can when you are scrapping them.
---
Grahm sells the plan. the easiest way is to ask a friend to build one in your camp. as long as you dont scrap it, you can place it again if you want
---
100% agree, this ruined fallout for me. The other players are all dicks. Destroying your stuff and killing you just to be an asshole and usually it's some call of duty or fortnight reject that's like 12. You get to hear them laugh when you get mad at them for destroying your stuff. I just had a level seven one shot me with an exploding rifle, which you are not supposed to even be able to use that early on but I'm guessing he was another glitching hacker thinking it's funny to ruin the game for others. 
---
perks, armor effects, and leg effects are multiplicative to eachother.  the same effects are additive
---
so a 5 set of 20% reduction to ammo on armor makes all ammo 100% reduction. 
---
a 50% anti armor heavy legendary and 45% anti armor stabilized perk gives you about 70% reduction
---
Normally in mmorpgs or just open world rpgs there is usually both a soft floor and a hard wall to prevent low levels from immediately taking part in final boss events. The soft cap is usually just making the area getting to the boss harsh to the point where low levels get outright slaughtered or spend more resources than they can sustain or make up for in loot. If the devs are tight on map space they usually make a dungeon.  In this case they tried making a soft cap by putting it in the cranberry bog/high-rad zone and having a nuke for the event trigger. The issue is that you don't need to be in the nuke zone to tag/fight her and you can be pretty much fresh out of the vault and fast travel to your friend. There are no hard caps for participating in the event as you can be carried through the quests and there is no level wall to the area. 
---
I kind of wish the event took place inside of the glassed cavern and there was a level wall at the front door. That way when i launch a nuke i'm not dumping 8-10k .50cal into the queens face while i watch a bunch of low levels getting mauled and only tagging her periodically for the same reward. 
---
I've sorely missed the Slenderman glitch haha
---
Hmnnnnn, I thought they said the TSE energy weapons no longer drop in game.  That would make the weapon nearly impossible to obtain, unless it‚Äôs recently duped.
---
Boy, they‚Äôll destroy everything you own even if there‚Äôs no locks at all. 
---
I am assuming the next patch, next week. They have been emailing me back all day long.
---
Do whatever you want. People that are going to destroy a CAMP are going to do it one way or another. I want to see what is inside peoples CAMP. I pick the lock, or glitch in through the window by using a crafting workbench, pick the lock, or jump through the window (you can just jump through some). At my CAMP my junk extractor, water purifiers and doors are all open. Food is growing people can pick. They can use everything there if they want. And if they want to trash it they can do that too. I don't care.
---
Watoga station vendor has a chance for them
---
I literally just said it was before the patch 
---
Someone just said the red band cap is rare FYI 
---
Ok I will try that 
---
The mod or the plan?
---
There are three places I visit every login to grab some lead:
---
* Flatwoods Motel (weight room on first floor in the elbow of the L-shape of the building)
---
* Charleston FD (weight room behind classroom)
---
* Vault-Tec University (exercise room just inside south side door of main building - *not* the first building you face as you fast travel, the middle one)
---
Frustrating place that has all kinds of weights which for some reason can't be picked up: Prison weight yard. There is at least as much on the ground there are in all three places I've listed above, and they're not treated as acquirable assets.
---
^ this.  Just make as many lvl 20 light combat arms as you can to get the various mods you like.  As an FYI, the dense chest mods are vendor only, very rare and highly desirable.  If anyone sees a dense chest mod of any kind, buy it.  They're under 100 caps with three ranks of Hard Bargain, but I'd happily pay 1000 or more for a dense combat chest mod on my sniper.  My TSE bolt action pipe rifle will kill me instantly if a low wall is secretly in the way, even with a cushioned chest mod and three ranks of fireproof.
---
How much?
---
From what they're saying it's only in effect until the next patch, which is scheduled for next week.
---
And I said if you have one, 25,000 caps
---
Just like he said, it's random. I recently got a TSE radium and started unlocking it. Im got only two receivers, standard or powerful auto. I got one long barrel and three short. I got maybe 2-3 magazines luckily the max piercing is one of them. Last mod I recently unlocked was a silencer. That weapon has nearly as much mods as any other weapon, lots and lots of barrels, lots of receivers ect. I got only about 20% unlocked.
---
I have to say I have been disapointed with the radium. I knew it wasn't a great weapon as peole arent' lining up to get one whenever one is on sale, but, even after getting a silencer, I struggle with it. High level Super mutants don't even die into one clip of 20 bullets. While I can kill them with 4-8 revolver shots. Only hope remaining is getting semi auto receiver, as the full auto has huge recoil, even when firing one or two bullets at time, it pushes hard. And due to TSE it can't be used point black range where I could only use the full nominal firing speed.
---
Mods, don't think I've yet to see a plan for the chsinsaw.
---
There is a little rng still built into the "guaranteed" plans for some vendors, like the watoga station has chances at sturdy and heavy combat armor plans
---
And for cheapness. Make new armor instead of repairing old and having to pay over and over
---
You'll get it. I found 2 in a 2 day span of server hopping for an hour each time. Still haven't found my second Jet Pack yet though. I did get that the day after I got the X-1 armor so I've been super lucky. Jet pack and marsupial together is a game changer 
---
This is inaccurate. Weight reduction is all additive regardless of source and maxes at 90. If you see something that's 0.0, it's because it's so light that it simply rounded down to 0 (usually only ammo). Armor pen is multiplicative, yes, but as you pointed out, they're different stats.
---
To OP: Yes, 90 is max and it's additive.
---
When your BGS/Zenimax and are too lazy to fix your buggy ass code (and they are definitely lazy) it is 100% not a bug, but in fact a feature.
---
Ahh so duping is a feature until it's removed good to know
---
There is a wiki page for "Plan: Chainsaw Flamer" so I assume it has the possibility of spawning somewhere.
---
From my understanding once someone picks it up on that server it wont respawn. So if a location is cleared out it probably wont regenerate items on that server. Usually if a spot is cleared already I server hop and try again, usually to success on the first hop.
---
It is, when you play it with other people like you're supposed to. I just wish someone told the reviewers that before they shat all over the game's face. 
---
Wasteland Barbie agrees, thx, um. . . How 'bout a matching Power Armor paint?
---
Yeah some people see locks as a aggressive action and will take action on the house.
---
Its not overthinking at all. nice try. not my or bethesdas fault you cant keep track of your ammo
---
What about me? I've been around reddit for much longer than 4 months and I've had nothing but good things to say about the game. Are you saying I'm also a bot!? I don't wanna be a bot! *cries*
---
It's also really fun seeing large Groups at nuke zones with lots of people in interesting different paints...and then there's always like 5-10 identical Excavators there too lol. I'm sure we'd *all* appreciate the variety ü§£
---
Yeah t's extremely odd. 
---
Lol dog food cans on cafe tables. But I don't think they deliberately thought about it when making those spawns. It's just food item in food spawn.
---
Yeah when I've hanging around Watoga I've collected totals of hundreds of dog food. Few times I've managed to sell it but I got tired of that, too difficult, now I just consume it fast without stocking up.
---
Pretty much yeah, West Tek is the best spot. Very low disease chance, tons of enemies, next to no rads, tons of steel, 5.56 ammo, plastic (laser guns), caps and grenades. Plus legendaries on occasion and good exp. 
---
Freak Show is south of West Tek on the road leading from huntersville to the cranberry bog.
---
What platform?
---
I bought a 4K TV and One X in anticipation of FO76.
---
The game has already been a disappointment, I wouldn‚Äôt be too happy to have the resolution worsened too.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve been looking for some Sugar Reeds for a long time in the Savage Divide, sadly I‚Äôve only been able to find them in the forest region...
---
I just want sugar and water in a good spot on the map:(
---
Awesome. Thanks for the information and it confirmed my suspicion on how it was working. 
---
I probably have more than 300 hours, perhaps over 400, I would have to check. This game is essentially "fallout with friends", and it does that just fine. Yes, it needs more content once you've explored the map fully, but for someone who hasn't played the game there should be a few weeks of stuff to do as they level..
---
The reason it's bad advice to buy the game when new content drops, is it's very likely you'll need a higher level to enjoy that content. Plus there's supposed to be new content weekly, so if they are locked out level wise they won't get to experience this content while it's new.
---
The game has very few bugs that are "bad", much less game breaking. My friends and I have never lost any items, and I don't think it's common, just something players can jump on the bandwagon of hate, with no way to prove they have, or disprove they have lost any items.
---
Community is fine, most players are friendly, and I recommend this game now more than ever. It's far from perfect, but we can see what comes with the new content.
---
One level 1 perk in endurance will heal nearly all your minor rads when in sunlight outside. All the little you collect from dipping into water, all the little you get from food or drink.
---
If you are more into rads, you can have it at level 2 too.
---
Graphics are client side. Servers don't care about visuals. 
---
That stuff is so hard to find.  My only luck has been at whitesprings in the little creek, and along the creek from vault 76 to flatwoods
---
Why yes that is annoying maybe you can tell me where your camp is so I can help you defend it 
---
I believe graham has it 
---
Thanks for putting together this info for us other Wastelanders, man!  As a level 245 I am humbled and further educated on good spots from your post.
---
This sub  I swear forgets how much bs this game has put out from it and the company. Its like honeymoon phase/ realization its a bad game / honeymoon again. 
---
I understand that. Do you think this is more important to you than stability? Or do you have any other ideas? The engine just seems stretched to the limit and I guess I just don't see how the game could manage anything more (meaning new content) without said new content being a completely different server world area thing.
---
They should just half the robots and ghouls at Whitesprings
---
How did you get all these mods?
---
He wasn't mic'd but had a dude yesterday had all of the ghoul's of Whitespring Golf resort chasing him. He was level 100 and I was level 92... he came running into the gift shop downstairs with all of them... with only a melee weapon. I only had a shotgun and a TSE and didn't want to use it in an confined space and especially near him. I was cussing him out to myself as I quickly ran away. I was able to thin the ones out who followed me and kill them. I saw a notification inside the building that he had gotten himself killed. 
---
I don't mind helping out others who have gotten themselves over their heads but please don't bring 3 dozen ghouls to me and assume we both should be able to make quick work of them
---
In this case I was screaming like a girly while cussing him out at the same time. 
---
Have you recently moved your camp? Not reset the boundaries, but picked up and moved the little machine?
---
My favorite stupid moment was 2 days ago. A guy I met dropped by and ee decided to go to a fissure site while he was waiting to meet up with some other friends. 
---
We kill one, then 2 more show up. After dispatching them (he's about 20 levels higher than I am and lethal with melee) another of his friends show up and they invite me to check out the first guy's camp. 
---
We had been running around, and I had kind of lost my sense of where I was. I *thought* I was right at the far edge of the fissure. Anyway, they started running and jumped as they went over a rise. I followed and jumped too, and fell like a rock into the middle of the fissure. 
---
I was loaded down with scrap. Even a lot of ultracite. They both had the marsupial mutation, and I had the stupid mutation. 
---
Anyway, it was a cool view sitting down in the fissure waiting to die. We took turns trying to hope down to what appeared to be a tiny ledge to recover the junk, with no luck. 
---
Was I miffed at myself for being so stupid and not paying attention to where I was? Yes, for about a second. 
---
But this game is about havibg fun and the rest of the day, even that idiotic moment, were all pretty fun. 
---
I do wish there had been a way to save that ultracite, and the screws I had been saving, but it's hardly the end of the world. 
---
We especially need a responder paint for the excavator armor so even in death madigan's dreams can still be realized
---
I wish I had another set of Calibrated Shocks for my Hotter Rod X-01 so I could ditch the Excavator set. The extra carry weight is just too good, though :/
---
Hey what‚Äôs up desert it‚Äôs Saadoff
---
Ain‚Äôt this some shit
---
Yes.  I have 5 pieces of armor with 20% Weapon weight reduction.  Takes everything down to 10% of reg weight.
---
I don't remember where I got it, but it definitely wasn't from the Atom Shop.  The plan does exist in the wild somewhere.
---
Hell no. Protect your camp‚Äôs location, and don‚Äôt build in a commonly traveled area. Do whatever you want, you can‚Äôt plan for the random excuses people dream up like OP‚Äôs.
---
I did!  Saw someone had it inside their camp soon did the same.  Was this the problem?!
---
Or combat armor.  Or marine.  
---
Mods. I think I've seen Phoenix carry them, too.
---
melee is vastly superior to ranged anyway. but yes, depending on your build, ammo will be a constant worry. heavy weapons are perpetually low on lead as you'll go through roughly 3000 rounds on your average session.
---
this applies to pretty much every build that doesn't make use of sneak bonuses.
---
FACE THE PAIN! FACE THE PAIN!
---
Yeah, that would be so different if there was somebody else on a server.
---
The scorchbeast queen takes a ton of ammo but everything else is not too bad and melee is pretty strong besides 
---
I'm not saying the games is bad, in fact, I'm completely confident that many people are having a blast playing it.
---
However, the OP does sound like a corporate shill.
---
Yeah that is true, but if people see a locked door they will put their salami rod through that door
---
This is the real issue.  The assumption, and it's a completely valid one to make, is that anyone with a high bounty is using a bad faith build, and for that matter is probably low on Caps and Junk to minimize any penalty to themselves.
---
&gt;Here you're going to get a bunch of people telling you how amazing the game is, the problems are exaggerated or don't exist, it's SO FUN with friends, etc.
---
There isn't a single person writing that. Take a look-- not one!
---
Fallout 4 sub is 'unbiased'? HAH. There's been so much disapproval and outright hate aimed at this game from that sub, even pre-launch when no valid opinions on the game existed. There's a reason Fallout 76 rarely comes up over there and it's not because there are a ton of unbiased players. Look at the top 40 posts and tell me how many are about 76, let alone positive or nuanced looks at the game. 
---
I think most people here have given balanced answers (and your own direct answers are as well). 
---
It seems most of the people who got fed up left now. 
---
Yep my camp door is always open and food, water outside for the taking. Unless its one of those few times I forget to leave it open. I will close while crafting just so nobody gets a sneak shot on me while crafting and I don't use windows. My camp is a box with what I need only as I want put time into a camp as I did in fo4 because of pvp. 
---
‚ÄúRaiders‚Äù hahaha! Aw man, so funny.
---
I'd also love to see a rad scrubber mod for the excavator. 
---
Given the purpose of the armor, it's a no-brainer that there should be one. 
---
I totally agree abouit the paint jobs. 
---
They literally cost $0 because you are given money for free. Stop crying.
---
Ammo is only a struggle until you get your perks in line with a ranged build. There are plenty of good guns floating around for cheap that wont take tons of shots to kill something. The days of 1 shotting everything are gone but its replaced by a slower paced 2-5 shot for almost everything. It really is not bad. 
---
I will certainly keep an eye out for you 
---
10k
---
Bahaha I like your style. I t-bag as many corpses as I can, in my underwear as much as I can.
---
I believe it's called 'mirror ball' no?
---
You can make a ton of your own ammo if you know what kinda junk to pick up and eventually pick perks like Ammosmith and Super Duper to yield more ammo when crafting. There‚Äôs a gym in the starting town that I always check for weights that can be scrapped into lead. Stuff like certain tin cans, paint cans, and toy wood blocks can all be scrapped down into lead for ammo crafting. Gunpowder is pretty plentiful and easily crafted as well. 
---
If junk hoarding ain‚Äôt your thing there are lead deposits out in the world you can build your camp on to get a constant supply of lead as well. Some workshops have lead deposits you can utilize as well. There‚Äôs even an ammo factory up north you can claim for making ammo but I‚Äôve seen people fight over it before so your call on that one, lol. 
---
I NEVER buy ammo and I‚Äôm constantly sitting at over 1k rounds of ammo for my main gun. It‚Äôs really not that bad. Get the stuff, get good perks and you‚Äôll be fine. :)
---
The client crashes all the time, I rarely DC. I have the XB1 S. Does the game freezing (not losing connection) have anything to do with the client?
---
Much appreciated.
---
Watoga station. White Springs station. 
---
The mod area of the shopping mall in the white Springs. 
---
Haha love it, fun for the whole family.
---
The lack of one is the reason I've not spent any Atoms... Since I live in my Excavator armor, why buy paint for PA I don't use?
---
Yeah I just took a place where I couldn't clear it without dying at least once with my two shot Gatling gun. What did I use? I used a vampiric one handed knife and of course all the one-handed bonus cards that can be used didn't even get close to death. So you don't really need to worry about ammo most times
---
I'll add you when I come back to 76, love building and spent too many hours myself.
---
That's game stability not server stability. There is a difference. 
---
Try getting 10 and scrapping them all at once. 
---
Melee is better after the tse patch. But ranged is still doable just takes more rounds. You wont have kick ass ranged at lower levels so some enemies will be hard as they should be. Sneak rifle builds work well. But falls on what ya wanna play as. It's not too hard to get ammo when you find ppl who dont use what you need. I run into plenty of melee builds that picked up ammo they dont need. Or shotgunners who dont need rifle ammo vise versa. Or even buy ammo from here helps. Even if you find some nice person who has the cards to get more ammo when crafted (i.e. ammosmith n super duper) and throw em some steel and lead to craft more than you normally would 
---
Yaaaa, looks like this was a wildly unpopular idea...  
---
This happened to me. I had placed the camp over a rock that had been bulldozed. My theory is that it loads the land first, then the camp. Of course it can't place if it's inside a rock or other object.
---
I forgot what it's like to play with someone lol. If you want to stop the invisible glitch wait till your friend is fully loaded in then fast travel in. 
---
Thanks all for the quick, detailed replies. 
---
Some of us believe we can call Bethesda on their mistakes (IMO this sub has *not* failed to do that) *and* share the good times we're having in the same sub. I don't believe the bad should nullify the good.
---
I am on ps4 :) where can I find this plan??
---
Ugh at least I was clear about not being smart, stability in general then. Few people have extreme DC issues. Most times the game engine just seems to be shitting its pants.
---
Lucky you. I always seem to get some Aiden who follows me around the map squeaking into his microphone about me dropping some chems for him, while simultaneously spamming me with party invites and a friend request even though we literally just crossed paths 
---
Oh sweet!
---
Some good defense perks are some that increase your damage resistance, like for example Barbarian in Strength, Ironclad in Endurance and Evasive in Agility. Barbarian and Evasive scale with your Strength and Agility points. Then there is Lone Wanderer in Charisma. It gives you a 20% damage reduction. Then there is Blocker in Strength. It reduces melee damage by 45%. Then there is Nerd Rage in Intelligence, when below 20% health it gives you a little damage resistance. Then there is Serendipity in Luck, when below 30% health you have a 45% chance to avoid damage, if I remember correctly. Then there is Dodgy in Agility. It reduces damage by 30% at a cost of 30 AP. This can be good or bad depending on the type of weapon the enemy is using and the number of enemies. Works good for single enemy using slow hitting/firing weapons, bad against fast firing weapons or multiple enemies. 
---
As for armor, it depends on if you're melee or ranged. Assassin armor gives you -8% damage from other players, so up to -40% with all 5 pieces. Then there is sentinel and cavalier that have -15% when standing still or when sprinting. Unyielding is also good as it boosts your stats. There are different ways you can combine them to get well rounded defense.
---
Troubleshooter armor is good against Robots. Mutant Slayer armor is good against Super Mutants. Zealots is good against Scorched. Ghoul Slayer good against Ghouls. Etc. They can give you up to -75% against those enemies with a full set. So definitely worth collecting the pieces if you find them. I have a full set of Troubleshooter so far for silos. It's really nice. I have some bits and pieces for others but no complete set yet. I had full Assassin set before, but gave some pieces away and sold some when I got higher tiered versions with sentinel/cavalier.
---
Interesting.  Thanks for this.  I‚Äôll test this as soon as I get back online.  
---
Honestly just post on the market subs looking for a mechanic. I'm sure someone could install shocks for you for like 500-1K caps + materials.
---
Yes! That‚Äôs it!
---
The truth is out there
---
Yep. But why bother? Not like you can take anything.
---
Take this down. Nobody needs this.
---
It sounds like you just want to be able to start a level 50 alt. 
---
I'll get Caps that appear from out of nowhere too, but never every minute.  I don't know what causes it.
---
it's not really a glitch.
---
To expensive better and quicker to just farm WhiteSprings 
---
I‚Äôve been on for like 3 hours tonight and haven‚Äôt seen anything about it tbh. 
---
I don't know but I just got home and I have the same error on my screen. im on xbox so yep.
---
I have the prime receiver plan for it if you happen to get it, or just want it. 
---
Nobody's playing, troll. ESAD, dismissed.
---
Just for fun to harmlessly mess with people.
---
I just did the same thing. Played from beta hardcore. Hit level 78. Then took a break. Just started all new. Deleted my 78 and started over. Level 8 also. 
---
Why do people seek out ways to exploit the game? I‚Äôve never seen the appeal of it 
---
Oh nice. thanks for the tip!
---
or hear me out... i leave it up because your opinion means very little &lt;3
---
There's a perk that increases your chances of finding extra ammo in an ammo box. I can't guarantee that it works, but people say it sometimes generates new cores. 
---
Also, sort of related, there's perk that slows down how fast your cores drain. 
---
Finally, if you go to the Grafton train station, there's a building with a weapon workbench to the north. On the other side of it is a generator. Go there and server hop a few times if there's no core. 
---
nah i dont think so, think of it as one extra thing to do in this dead game lol
---
It's good againts enviroment enemies. With high enough sneak you can sit next to them and they won't see you. Well not againts high perception enemies but most.
---
At long range you can fire several times and get sneak crit bonus.
---
thats true, just an alternative suggestion for people that are bored of the meta
---
opinions opinions

Great news, glad you got sorted out!

If you crash and rejoin the game, and if you only see the other player you were playing with on the list of players, then there is no one else.
---
Where can I find firecaps and starlight berries?
---
I've been having pretty good luck on ps4 so far but I saved this just in case 
---
YES ! thank you so much
---
Yes they changed it at some point. Previously players who you have seen on the server, but have logged off, were greyed out. It's no longer making that distinction.
---
But if you see no one on map and it's getting late, then it's mainly you and maybe max 3 others.
---
Does luck have anything to do with it?
---
If you've been on server for hours, that's quite a long list to go through. Although good tip.
---
Difficult question for #1 because it has a lot to do with two variables we can't account for:  a. Your own view of what constitutes 'game-breaking', and b. The RNG involved in what bugs you personally will encounter. But I'll give some answers a shot:
---
1. The game has quite a few bugs, though I wouldn't say it's a surprising amount for a Bethesda game. None of the ones I encounter bother me much, and some are funny or even helpful (like perma-sprint). The only game-breaking problem I'm aware of isn't a bug, it's server performance. This seems highly inconsistent as I've seen people say they crash hourly, and then there are people like myself who can play a 6 hour session without a single crash. You're gonna have to roll the dice on that one but if you have a low tolerance for crashes you may not want to risk it. 
---
2. The cash shop is mediocre, I'd say. But again, it depends on you, because there are about five different things for sale, so if you only have interest in one of them (as I do, decor) the shop can seem lacking in options.  And some of the options can seem quite strange, like the pink princess bed. The prices range from reasonable to ridiculous, but this is no different from cash shop prices I've seen in other games. You can get atoms pretty easily in-game, especially when you start and are banging out a lot of new achievements, and there's no real hard cap. How many you get in a day depends on the time played and what you do-- I tend to play without paying any attention to dailies and achievements, and I've purchased about 6 cash shop items so far. Still sitting on about 1000 atoms right now, too.

3. I can't answer this well because I don't use mic with strangers. I mute all voice chat and just do my thing cause I like maximum immersion. But I can say that I've never had a single bad experience in-game, people seem respectful and helpful, and you're not likely to find any better from another MP community. The real community challenge comes from dealing with the media presence of 76. If you're someone who enjoys reading all about your favourite game you may need to develop thicker skin to deal with the casual bashing that happens so often, games news running every negative story they can get, and swinging mood of this sub. But in-game most people are chill... plus this game's systems don't offer much opportunity to really troll or grief people.
---
In the big picture,  if you're a patient person who loves the idea of a big, more diverse Fallout wasteland to explore, and you don't mind an absence of traditional SP questing depth and human NPCs, you'll do fine. :3
---
Last note-- if you do end up playing and want a positive community, check out [Filthy Casuals.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76filthycasuals)  They don't really try to be objective about the game, rather the goal is simply to enjoy rather than judge it, so not the best place for neutral opinions. But certainly a great place if you want a friendly community that doesn't complain (literally, there's a rule against complaining).

WHAT IS THAT ABOMINATION!?
---
If you're invisible, if you switch weapons, it'll generally make you visible again. 
---
Not cool bro.
---
That‚Äôs great advice thanks so much!!
---
how?
---
Why exploit xp. Your better off going to whitesprings and just killing a bunch of ghouls even without the camp.
---
I get 50xp every time I join a server. It's not much but it's free
---
Thanks for the advice !!

Hey. I‚Äôll buy the 3 Star Ultracite Laser Rifle off of you for 2000 caps. I‚Äôm online right now.

My wife and I play this together all the time. We love it as well.  
---
Yep, the vendorbot (Greg, i think?) in Grafton (not the station vendor) and Camden Park vendorbot Chad have Excavator PA mod plans. 
---
They told me I was banned until the patch goes live for having acquired 100k "rare items" within 30 days. I'm not sure where these 100k items came from, but I asked for a list of said items and they have yet to get back to me. 
---
Isn't the name Lewis usually stereotyped into smart people who like to correct others? Because I'd say might not be a dick, but you're being quite a Lewis. 
---
no the only shielded u can get from a vendor is enclave everything else is from quest/events.
---
I have a. 50 cal sniper rifle, 120 bulk lead, I keep about 10 bulk steel. The only thing I get low on is gun powder. 
---
Only thing I have ever had in high quantities was ammo and it was 5mm at around 10k.
---
this is faster, and im sick of going to whitesprings. dont understand why people get triggered over these getting posted 
---
Next month, homie. 
---
Share a screenshot when you‚Äôre done please, I‚Äôm curious!
---
Ha ha 
---
Because loading screens are boring.
---
Yeah, I've definitely had a lot of ammo, but I've either farmed it or made it myself using ammosmith + super duper. Their own perk cards. I've also picked up a lot of loot bags because I'm always farming nuke zones. It's difficult to find something entertaining to do when you're level 140. 
---
BoS shielded lining is quest reward for handing in technical data
---
Yes. Specially 3* heavy combat assassin/sentinel . Most are duped. Just as TSE. 
---
I‚Äôd take paste over indieSPLIFF any day. Lol. 
---
Seriously though...
---
Because it's fun to find the path of least resistance.
---
Ghouls are just people who were tripping on acid when the nukes hit. It saved them from death, but permanently fried their brains. When they hit you, the nuclear enhanced potency of that acid transfers into you for a moment.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm putting it up for trade rn, I‚Äôll msg you if I get no offers and we can get that deal done
---
Same man.... I‚Äôm a 59 baby compared with several of my friends.

Last night I get a message ‚ÄúWanna do some Queens?‚Äù
---
Hell. Yes.
---
I always get one shot in.... but watching them work her as a mele kill is fun as hell. :D
---
I love the people I get to run the wastes with.
---
What's the damage like on that .50 Cal? I get around 145 dmg per shot on my .45 lever action.
---
Thats the way I described my understanding of it...and why I keep dropping the tech data that is the quest I believe I need to do to get the final, shielded, variety. But shouldn't there be either no lining offered to me at this point? Or at least have the protective variety still showing up as the one offered since that is the last variety in the progression and what I currently have equipped/modded? 
---
Instead it is resistant that is in the vendors inventory every time I go there, which is why I'm becoming concerned the progression is broken...
---
I thinks it's around 130 or so, but I have a 2 shot
---
sneak bonuses means you're essentially using 2.5 times less bullets
---
coupled with adrenal reaction and your preferred legendary prefix that number drops even lower
---
but for someone just starting the game that doesn't mean much.
---
nope if your on ps4 i would love you to try it and see :).
---
or how about i dont. you dont know who needs this? some people may not want to grind xp naturally in this dead game, the only people that still play are people who survived the dupe deletion and collectors, theres also always new people buying the game and i think they would appreciate things like this to give them a head start , whys that a problem to you lol? 
---
Sounds good to me. üëç
---
no i have all variants and vendors still offer me other linings i already know
---
you think that's bad? try using a LMG.
---
I def had trouble with ammo early on... 
---
Okay. I was wondering if it was vastly superior. Looks to be about the same base damage.
---
They did hint at some content updates coming next patch. Wouldn't be surprised if this is something that may happen.
---
My never duped on lvl 210 account got banned ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, sure I was OP but that‚Äôs what you become when you have over 550 hrs in a game. Maybe it time for us to stop kicking the dead horse that is 76 finally

X-01 mod plans can‚Äôt be bought, as far as I know. Server hop at Enclave Bunker‚Äôs Armory terminal until you find the prebuilt mod, and buy it there u/sinistas

You too, huh?

In addition to white knight, level up the "fix it good" perk card under intelligence. You can repair your armor up to 200% of normal condition.
---
&gt;Not only do we have the three different platforms which don‚Äôt intermingle, 
---
Standard to many games.

&gt;but I suspect each server is built around the native language of the players so that microphone and text chatting could happen across people who speak the same language.
---
And how does the server know of your native language?
---
The bullies have a game they play apparently where three of them walk around together, one will attack you or your camp and become wanted, then if you fight back all three gang up on you and kill you then completely destroy your camp. If bethesda does not put an end to this soon they will start losing players fast

harpoons dont have the DPM though. plus, Im not a min/max rifleman.

ok np it was just something i was assuming you hadnt seen lol
---
I read acquiring too many items quickly or legendary items with raise a flag under this new search for them. I see a lot of bags in Nuke zones and not just junk, it's a lot of 1 star items that no one uses so they dump them. I usually pick them up and sell them for caps.

Tbh I find this hard to believe. I even find it hard to believe they'd be so clear about what you did wrong. Where did they send you this response, can we see? I don't mean to size you up, this genuinely upsets me if true and I guess that's why I refuse to believe. There is a lot of lies and salt on this game.
---
It happened to me once. I took off my armor and my auto stim perk card (no idea what it's actually called)stored my junk and found a person at Sutton station. Kept me from breaking my armor and wasting stims. Dude must have known what was up, he just capped me in the head with a .44.
---
It will be an Atom store item. It will be 1800 Atoms and everyone will jump on it. 
---
If you stack your perks into stealth and ranged crits, you can down nearly anything very fast, usually in a single shot. I use a regular combat rifle most of the time, specifically because .45 ammo is very plentiful in this game, and can drop almost anything in a few hits. And that weapon isn‚Äôt even good, I just have a hard on for it
---
&gt;1400 isn't that good tbh
---
Lol. And Im trying to grind enemies with weapons doing 60-80 damage, with 140 being current max I have.
---
The problem is, a lot of people are down voting posts or intentionally trying to take the piss out of people thinking people have been banned for legitimate. Unfortunately I feel these people are also intentionally looking past the facts which includes

Significant amount of people are reporting this issue

It is highly unlikely that this many people would obtain a ridiculous surplus of "rare" items or obtained them over the course of 30 days. The only people who would are people who were selling items for money. Majority of the people who posted about this don't quite "fit the bill".
---
Duplication Removal was last Thursday which as far as I know resulted in no bans and only affected less than 1% of accounts. If there were bans, then this would have been when they would have happened.
---
No e-mails were sent out  
---
All support responses come off as artificial and follow the pattern of "If restarting the game didn't fix it, then you probably are banned". The most comical response some people are getting is that the Beta is over and to buy the full game.
---
  
---
Other characteristics associated with the ban process such as the error code, e-mails, ability to access other games via the Bethesda launcher is not present.
---
There are things that suggest this is a technical issue. One redditor claiming to know some insight on what is happening that any response you are getting is either automated or by people who are not aware of the problem.

Lucky hole mines in excavator armor can get you about 400 lead ore. There are multiple map locations for iron or, or workshops with iron extractors for steel but I usually just run through a town or building, pick up everything and end up with a couple hundred steel.

If you hit up some super mutant locations you'll get plenty of gun powder. 
---
Acid is a bit tougher to get but still attainable. You'll need that for smelting the ore or making your own gun powder.

Here is the video. It shows testing of stacked explosive bobbleheads, and the interaction with the slap mechanic. It is true that the bobbleheads will work on any PvE enemy, but not on other players, it seems that the slap mechanic is a hard number it diminishes your damage to. 
---
Was fun as always, thanks :)
---
Strange how smooth things run when there is no low levels around...
---
Will be perfect when they fix the loot RNG  later this week :)

Me and Trap yeah
---
During the past week, I've just been selling aids and junk in my camp in Flatwoods, and 80% of the +100 customers who came to me, they were using the same yellow Excavatarors PA...
---
Also a good idea is to carry a couple weapons that use different ammo types. Enemies drop bullets and theres a bunch of ammo containers on the map. If you're low on one type just switch to another gun or melee the easier enemies.

Same happened to me here is the email

Couldn't agree more. It's the most frustrating gaming experience in my life...but I love it and can't wait to get home to play it haha!

In my opinion, I think that it would be 100% better if there were human NPCs and separate PvP and PvE servers.

I'm lvl 10 and have more than I can use.

Negativity kills so I stay on positivity and watch and participate for long extended times, probably 5-6 times longer than ‚Äúnormal people‚Äù - I watched and waited as things that were broken under stipulation of being pending to be fixed instead were just pruned out. I stood in awe as drain was circled, total astonishment they could treat any segment of players how those black harvest Dem warlocks were treated after conclusion of the version 5 era of the game, then the gladiators, anyone who loved hunter volley.
---
 Then it got smaller and smaller like the iconic things being changed, for no reason, like some of the sounds in arcane mage spells. Changes with no logic and just net hurting the soul of the game and the hearts of the players who had spent their minutes wandering it, who had come to rely on it as a consistent safe space. They destroyed that, gradually, with senseless changes and prunes, equal parts with the shelving of classic elements that created the safe space to begin with. That is why the slot machine criticism now exists. All character building was abandoned. People loved playing in alternative styles thanks to the choices glyphs offered. It was destroyed super grandly while some players even had their spells and sometimes entire sets of abilities cancelled and force fed something completely incompatible with the previous iterations in the name of Class fantasy design. What was the purpose of that. They forgot that character building is what makes a game an rpg. Somehow the core ideas made their way into the Diablo expansion, a fact I somehow just now realized. The stuff that good round about v5 in Azeroth are alive and well in lots of ways in the current d3 season gameplay. 
---
If they would fix the moronic reload animation it would be great.  Your character reloads the damn thing like they have 2 left hands and 10 thumbs.
---
Digital copy xbox 1
---
Yes it would be. However the game should then never allow your stash to go over it's max.
---
git gud and make a bloodied build.

I wouldn't mind a radio host.

I would love the ability for players to host their own radio stations but that would be a lot of development work
---
Er, no. Sounds like you‚Äôre just not getting my logic. And it sounds like you don‚Äôt understand Dark Souls pvp. Which is fine. A lot of people don‚Äôt give it enough time to understand why it‚Äôs so good, because they‚Äôre scared of the bad invader men. But I encourage you to give it another shot.
---
You‚Äôre cutting out the most important part of my sentence. It‚Äôs balanced **around** pvp. In fact, without that bit, the sentence becomes untrue. Dark Souls has never been properly balanced for pvp. It‚Äôs a single player game, and the multiplayer serves to enhance the single player. And sometimes (ie always) that means there‚Äôs balance issues in pvp. DS3 ended up being decently balanced, but it‚Äôs far from perfect.
---
In Fallout 76 there‚Äôs no mechanical reason to pvp. The resources you get from pvp can be gotten more easily through pve in general. And even if you get a lucky haul... you don‚Äôt know that until after you‚Äôve decided to take a chance shooting someone. The only reason to seek out pvp is for the sake of it. And since a large portion of the player base doesn‚Äôt want pvp, that makes you a dick. 
---
Next time you play with your sister, let her loot everything first and report back to us, please. Thank you.
---
Dammit!!! I NEED these plans!! I am late to the party but trying to build a BoS character.

Guess they have been taken off the vendor lists for when they finally introduce faction PvP.

Yeah we seem to take it down pretty nice and easy. On a great run right now. Can‚Äôt wait for the update

It's 100 percent Grahm that has it. Got it this morning. However, it's rare that he has it. 
---
Lol ok
---
Mind your own business is a great motto.  I've done it before (don't find the need nowadays) and I get why people do it.  I've talked over voice with people that were cool with it and would use the base as a safety zone (usually lower levels; good for them) and with people that would rage and froth over it.
---
I almost thought it might be wrong to do but what swung it in my head was after seeing a dude just like you rampage through these camps, then followed him talking to him over voice regarding if he thought it was good/bad ingame etiquette to make these camps while he went to his buddies camp across the way, still on the golf course (!!!) and he admitted that he also occasionally made these types of camps himeself, but would destroy others camps that did it while proclaiming "for great justice!".  It was a reality check for me: nothing has changed with the internet, this was, is, and always will be how people act.
---
What it boils down to is: people can and will do what they want within the rules of the game.  People can build their camp wherever they goddamn well please, and you are free to wreck it.  Don't hide behind the "oh I'm righting a wrong" bullshit.  You want to wreck some camps, and this is your excuse to do it; it's easy to see through your narcissistic reasoning.  Don't think it's any better or worse than someone just doing it somewhere else on the map for fun.  The game allows this: it's part of the gameplay.  At least the Raider players laugh and admit it for what it is.
---
If you cannot handle other people building there, petition Bethesda to extend the non-build-able area around Whitesprings.  Until then, stop telling people how to play.
---
freal. luv u doe
---
Honestly if you want any hope for the game just get it on a consol, PC version seems super wack for no reason 
---
Being smart is a bad thing is it? Too bad you wouldn't know because your attempt at being a dick fell flat on it's face. 
---
Of course not. It's a question of volume. 
---
This game has mechanics that let you say "no thanks, i don't want to play with you right now". If you ignore those mechanics, you are a fucking asshole. 
---
Platform?  Have a 3* Vampires Ski Sword w/ +40% Power Attack DMG, +1 STR.  Has been my NukeSprings one shotter for a long time now. 
---
I've been doing all the challenges. Daily's every day and working on the longer ones as well. 
---
In the case of lower level players, you tag whatever the turrets are shooting and help the turrets kill the mobs.  This is the only way to make it work/make sense.  The CAMP becomes a safe zone and a place to herd the ghouls together for easy killing.  In the end it is no different than if someone with a minigun stayed in the "safe" area by the pickup truck and kept spraying mobs as others fought them (well other than the ammo and weapon durability lost).
---
Me: Level 61

Ghouls: ( About 10, 4 charred) levels 50 and above

---
Thats wild man haha, I remember this one time I shot some super mutants at Harpers Ferry and the entire city aggro'd me! Really wild that a game can do that!
---
This is true.  The only effective stategy here is to make sure you tag the aggro'd enemies, and/or help the turrets make the kills.  Mind you this doesn't work just for the CAMP owner but for anyone that takes advantage of the turret support.
---
i totally agree with you, i was hoping there would be interesting mods and cool stuff for the pc version like there was for fonv and fo4... i thought the mods would be done like space engineers do mods or really close... it feels like every decision bethesda has made regarding this game has been a bust for PC users... i just wish i could get my money back at this point, im really that upset over this.

I never said it was, nor was I trying to be a dick. I was moreso trying to be "humorous" I guess? For lack of a better word.

This person gets it.  Play how you want!

Yeah people are pretty dumb when it comes the game of who is gonna get more caps... I love it

I do agree that I miss this feature, and it would be neat to display stuff, however, using items by picking them up you could glitch through walls easily and scale walls and all these unintended uses that wouldn‚Äôt be ideal for a multiplayer game, sadly I doubt they would add it back in

I will say that the missile turrets are annoying as all shit, that would be a good reason to stomp some camps if they are exploding in your face on your monitor.  Gun/shotgun/laser turrets are fine.

They sent me an itemized list with item quantities. It was quite specific but WILDY inaccurate. Half the shit they said I had over 1 million of I had never even heard of.

No problem you want my social too while you‚Äôre at it?

This post is awesome you go into a lot of detail about each spot and tell people what to expect. With this post being words on screen instead of a youtube video I can say is more useful and helpful than any video I've seen on YouTube. Thank you for this post!

Basically glyphs is extracting the power out of an item into a sequel to the horadric cube, now. You can choose what ones of those you like plus more with the stuff you actually equip. It‚Äôs like a finished version of what glyphs should have been, I can‚Äôt believe where they went in Warcraft with weapons using a talent tree that didn‚Äôt actually have real choices of variances. The game became a set of load outs you got forced to use for whichever situation similar to overwatch. Like they wanted to force feed a sports styled game in rpg flavoring and still have the buy in of the rpg gamers that made it a success before they Forgot.

You have protective or shielded?

This is the absolute worst game for PVP. Please find another game to scratch your PVP itch. My suggestion: Division 2

Seeing as MANY duplication glitches involve this very exact thing, I highly doubt Bethy will bring it back to 76.

I can confirm that the regular police uniform count towards this challenge. The hat does not though.
---
12hr and 33m to reinstall the game? Are you redownloading every time you reinstall? This isn‚Äôt a dig at you, I am actually curious. If you aren‚Äôt having to redownload, what kind of hard drive do you have?
---
I think farming could be more complicated....like certain crops can only be placed in certain areas...not just anything can be planted in dirt...but things like "Mutfruit must be placed within X distance of a natural source of water" and "Tatos can go anywhere but corn and carrots cannot be planted within X distance of stone" etc etc.  Add to that things like, yes, being able to cultivate some of the other plants like soot flower, firecaps, bloodleaf, etc.
---
Things to make the game more interesting....but almost feels like it belongs in "survival mode"....specifically a hard mode mechanic.
---
Could def get in, trust that, no breaking anything

Fireproof + a dense torso mod and scorchbeasts become way less scary.

---
So what you're saying is Bathesda shouldn't have bothered with this fiasco and just done their normal single player experience?
---
Bugs
---
No. Not only no, but there is less instinctive to play now then at launch, and there is no change to any of that in the near future. If there is a change to that, its likely to be negative.
---
Just wait till March 
---
I have it are you on ps4?
---
It really showed that FO dev team had all the experience with a solo game but very little understanding of a multi player game. When you create an online society people want IDENTITY, both armors and weapons. Call of Duty WWII did an excellent job and many people would buy custom in-game costumes with real world money. For a solo game it doesn‚Äôt matter, but when you have many players in one world everyone want to show off their own taste. Now the lack of skins make everyone look like came from the same assembly line, even the ‚Äòscratches‚Äô and rust spots are identical. It‚Äôs just sad. 
---
Oops yep you‚Äôre correct lol
---
Don't take Ironclad. 5 points for 50 dmg/energy? Not a good tradeoff. 
---
Also, if you're melee you don't really need anything other than Unyielding+AP Refresh. I have around 450 AP at the moment, with Dodgy. My AP goes from empty to full in maybe 3-4 seconds, no joke. 
---
Dodgy, Serendipity, that perk that grants you resistances while sprinting, Barbarian, and a couple others. That's all you need. Dodgy + Serendipity is OP on their own.

Mainly looking for trade on that, but what‚Äôs the highest you‚Äôre willing to go and we‚Äôll go from there

You don't need to mod, just unlocking. To get the shielded do the census violence event.

I'm waiting on my list. Did you get a permanent ban, or a temporary until they update ban?

Just log on and see for yourself. Not that hard to do really.

I launched a nuke at whiteprings and no one showed up. It was a nice change for once. Though I started missing seeing people.

It doesn't look very well for a game to have an abandoned server for 8 hours

Same here. Finished for the night, hopefully reloading it will work.

whyyyyy bethesda whyyyyyyyyy just fix the fken game nobody even cares about economy even the pvpers lol

It‚Äôs a pretty damn big download, and it would take quite a while to check everything and determine if anything was new. Thankfully most people on here aren‚Äôt douche bags and can just answer the question.

Sorry for the wait but yeah I‚Äôll do the offer my gt is PepeBoi420

That‚Äôs kind of disappointing. I was hoping they‚Äôd have been at least putting out a few quests here and there. Thanks!

After loading in I will usually make a batch of adhesive first thing. Then I check to see if The Whitespring is crowded, if it is empty, I do a run through there. If it is crowded I will either go to the mining estates, or power up a power plant, or go to Watoga to slay robots. Then I make the rounds on the vendors, currently saving up for jet pack plans. Check for events in the areas of the various vendors along the way. Get home, repair, make ammo, chems, food, and another batch of adhesive since my farm will have replenished by this point. Finally I play the tuba and then go to bed, so when I log in I next time will be rested and tuned.
---
Cool story bro
---
Fire Engine Red!
---
Fuccking hell man. I quit 2 months ago because of all the garbage glitches and just general garbage. Logged on last night and started a new character and had an amazing relaxing time. God damn you Bethesda we deserve better than this :***(
---
I‚Äôve def noticed a sharp decline in traffic
---
Honestly kinda yeah 
---
Jesus Christ no way lmao wow
---
If we could settle an arena as raider do that would be great
---
I don‚Äôt understand why more people just do that. It helps my neighboring workshops!
---
That'd be cool
---
You're just garbage. I was taking down level 50+ when I was around 25-30. This was PvP, mind you, not just some Wanted guy. So stop trying to claim OP is lying just because you have no skill smh lol. 
---
It's especially difficult if you don't plan a good build. Especially in relation to a build you had in games before. I learned this lesson and have been desperately trying to get to an armor penetrating rile build ever since I saw tank killer.
---
This game seems to be about focus and not being able to have one of those god mode characters with no flaws like in 4 or 3 or NV
---
Yep! Like I said I only had to do it once. I also clear cache and rebuild database each time they do a patch. I've found that if I dont I tend to start seeing more crashes. Also, targeting HUD is still a system killer. I gave up on trying to use it because every time i do I crash within an hour. 
---
I dunno. I'm on the fence. Like you (and many others), I've wanted a paint scheme so badly, for so long. But at the end of the day, you can easily craft good T-51's and T-60's that can easily replace the Excavator. I feel that the Excavator is a utilitarian PA, so that's why I kind of like the basic yellow color. I love it for what it is, but at the same time I hate it because other PA's are better for combat. New paint schemes or no, the Excavator armor will always have a place  in my inventory.
---
Always glad to find new people to team up with. Feel free to add Jamesp1989 (let me know you are from reddit ) hope to see you in Appalachia

jetpack too,why the fuck can every other PA except ultracite have a jetpack but excavator not?

This is awesome, thanks for sharing your insights with the rest of the community and helping other players out.

Great work OP :)

---
Did you already sell the prime 2 shot explosive laser tifle?
---
what platform? not interested in getting rid of this one, but i have a 2* vampires also
---
&gt; Given the purpose of the armor, it's a no-brainer that there should be one.  
---
Zero thought was put into anything in this game.
---
No and it‚Äôs not explosive , how much are you looking for it
---
&gt;In your opinion is the TSE handmade a must have end game weapon?
---
(talking purely PvE and as solo player)
---
It WAS the end game gun. After the huge nerfs, it's no longer best and not even close. 
---
TSE is kinda requirement for high level players going againts higher level enemies, TSE now is about that TS or explosive was prior to nerfs. Actually less but then prior to nerfs TSE was basically "spray half a clip into ground, kill 10 max level enemies". Just because some people preferred that, didn't make it a requirement.
---
TS of most kind is now not worth much anything, it's okay for about levels 50- to maybe 70-80, above that you probably feel the need for something better because you are fighting enemies with nominal resistances of &gt;120. I remember the last non-legendary weapon I used, was pump action shotgun. It scaled okay little above level 60 or so, but after that I needed to use a minium of TS because others just didn't do enough damage, to cut through high level enemies huge damage resistances.
---
That boils down to TSE, AA E and few other two star and three star combos.
---
In trading any handmade is still highly preferred since people want the best and even getting anything else is a bit more difficult as handmades are most traded for. Some plain one stars are still fairly viable if you don't chase the best, like TS/instigating gauss rifle.
---
FO4 Ultimately feels like the better game due to this issue plus the ability to build multiple bases. Getting the heavy items out of storage somehow would be a huge help. If there could be various weapon/armor mounts available early for the player it would basically solve this issue. All those 20lb weapons could be displayed in a player made weapon vault. F04 has an in depth weapon display mod that lets you make very detailed Armories. I havent seen this option yet in 76, though just lvl 26 atm, so maybe its there? It would be weird to not have it. Plus if the Power Armor Chassis stay in world if in a Power Armor Station...again something im not sure is even a thing now but i have 4 Power Armor Chassis in my Stash plus etc armor pieces cuz im still trying to make the station...people want to save the Legendary Items just to have as a collection, so the ability to build a very large vault seems very important. Expanding the budget for your home base might be needed as well, it seems pretty small as is. Bethesda should know this a hoarding game! No it doesnt need to be a massive castle with endless geo. Just something to facilitate the player progression/base build up to maybe around lvl 100. Did they even test that deep in?  I remember maxing out the STASH day 1 and barely put any time in. Once you have collected too much its really hard to make space because a ton of the items are worth holding onto. The way it is now players have to pick and choose just a few weapons to hold onto and scrap the rest or just pointlessly drop it on the ground because all the Traders have 0 Caps. Once you have basically no room it kills the entire experience/desire of exploring. 
---
would you post the list here so if others get a list they can compare whether it's identical
---
I'm sorry, I meant the quad ultracite explosive.
---
Yeah on pc i always play with a guy from Norway, who does Norwegian swears, its very funny. 
---
Perm with no appeal
---
XB1. And he, I‚Äôd be interested in that.  
---
It's fun, buddy.  I got it for $30 at Christmas time and have been playing ever since.  Think it's worth the money.  The biggest problems I get are occasionally getting bumped from the server and then an excavator armor glitch where when you get in, it doesn't install a chest piece or leg but then after ten minutes, it puts itself on.  Aside from the occasional dork trying to get you to accidentally shoot them (to initiate PvP) so they can shoot you for your caps and junk, people are pretty friendly.  I had a random guy the other night come up and help me defend a workshop, was pretty fun.
---
What vendor was this?
---
Oh no, I have a guy wanting to buy it for 2k; if you want you can bid higher or trade for any of the items listed that I‚Äôm looking for 
---
Coo, I‚Äôd have bought one probably. It looks so badass
---
I can do 3k
---
Ohh ok well if you got anything in mind you want  lmk I‚Äôll check to see if. I have or caps 
---
Let me ask the other guy and see if he‚Äôll go higher
---
Dude, ALL mods until further notice are not to be used. End of story..... it's too hard to just allow mods and monitor them. Maybe one day there will be official mods but I am now wondering if beths real crime in this particular situation is miscommunication
---
I wouldn't of these only exist because people pulled them out of the Dev room, and it happens to unlock the plans if you scrap them. 
---
Anyone having this error get any headway to login? I'm seeing a few other posts about this effecting xBox, PS4 and PC
---
Sounds good
---
It always feels like almost all armor drops, like it seems, 80%, are right legs. Maybe it's just me. I know only I've been running this old left leg fooorrrrever and have been trying to replace it, but keep only finding other right legs. :(
---
Hey so I got a guy wanting to buy it for 3k, willing to go higher?
---
Good job doing that community service
---
I gotta say all the complaining about lack of ammo is from people who don‚Äôt want to or are unable to understand the notion of resource management.  I know it sucks but with a little grinding, a little intelligence and some careful use of your resources (don‚Äôt kill chump lev 5 scorchies with your valuable 5.56 ammo) you will have plenty of ammo.  I am a heavy gun user.  I also have a TSE handmade.  I have 10,000 rounds of 5mm, 20 plasma coures, and over 1000 rnds of 5.56 as of today.  Now, weapons breaking?  That‚Äôs a different story.
---
BoS one, but I don't think it was a natural spawn. I think a player dumped them there. As this helmet shouldn't be in the game it was pulled from the Dev room by some exploiters.  
---
And do to it's plan being learned when you scrap it... well unlike other dev room pulled items, it remained even after the original people got banned. 
---
Cry me a river because your wifi sucks, buddy. You're the kind of lazy player that cries about nerfing everything in 76 because you're shit at the game. #SorryNotSorry
---
*Boohoo SBQ is too strong. It's 100% not my fault. Please nerf it. Boohoo*
---
:s fair enough
---
If you see a lock on a house Adam aggressive action I'll be more than willing to claim my repair bill in caps from your bounty.
---
This has happening to me too, me and 2 pals launched on the SBQ. No one came üòÇ still only took us 5 mins to kill her. Launched on WS and had our fill. 
---
Sounds like they are off by a few zeroes on counting some items. I'm sure if you gather enough information from other people, you could make a considerable case.
---
I kinda thought the whole top of the world quest line was to introduce us to various gangs we could join
---
I'm right there with you. I was a little late progressing through the game. A buddy and I have the scorchbeast quest but don't want to do it seeing as killing her isn't worth it anymore.
---
This game has so much potential but holy crap do they need to fix stuff. I still think they should go back on their "no npcs" thing and bring a couple forward once another vault opens 
---
&gt;make sure you dont scrap a cop cap with a red band around it, thats rare.
---
With fresh char it doesn't take a lot to get that. I would not call it rare.
---
Wow I Alt-F4 all the time because quitting the game takes a long time...  now gettin login error too...
---
Nah, I love the game. It was just like a neat little vacation. As the guy stated below you start to miss people but.. 
---
stumbled upon this little goldmine yesterday, it was exactly what I had been looking for
---
Great tip for new and existing players, thanks for sharing. :) 
---
Exactly.  Well said.  If I‚Äôm wanted, I find the closest player and ask them to kill me.
---
That is ridiculous. Luckily enough I got a temporary ban. 
---
Hope they can see that people could buy them instead of thinking the person was a duper. Seems like if you even pick up something in a dropped bag you could be guilty in a few posts... crazy... 
---
Eat a dick
---
All the junk I see, is junk not looted by anyone else. I assume they didn't want to loot it.
---
This. If anyone has a list, I'd appreciate it, I've been waiting for 12 hours on an itemized list. 
---
I've had the same experience on GTA V in it's hayday. 
---
Here let me be a "Lewis" and correct your statements.
---
"Isn't the name Lewis usually stereotyped to smart people who like to correct others?  You might not be a dick but you are being quite a Lewis."
---
"I never said it was, nor was I trying to be a dick. I was trying to be humorous, I guess. 
---
What I believe would be called dry humor isn't your cup of tea, I assume. Apologies if I got off on the wrong foot."
---
The dick move is trying to inject your two cents in when it wasn't needed. Now I'm joyfully having fun at correcting you, because why not? If I'm going to be called something then I'd better be the best damn whatever I'm called, right?
---
Any way, how could someone not correct him when the name of the city is also in the picture. 
---
Sounds about right. From everyone‚Äôs responses, I should be good üëçüèª
---
I was tempted to last hoorah by nuking the munitions factory but that takes a minute and I just didn't have the patience.
---
Stealth Archer op.
---
Depends what workshop, some people probably still haven't discover all of them, the munitions factory typically get attack way to often
---
There is a sub for that, they sell for like 1.5k caps
---
Yeah it's always the way. I regularly dump ammo I don't need at train stations. One day I came across 5k rounds of something I did use, so kama is sweet sometimes.
---
I think it was 450 for the whole costume that's why I stopped even trying... wasn't going to do it daily for a year...lol
---
I already did the work. See my spreadsheet here to see all weapons and which ones you can learn to craft:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout_76_all_plans_recipes_weapons_weapon_mods/
---
I don't even have a turret on my camp at all.  Screw it. 
---
Jesus OP was right. This guy is a douchebag
---
It and the cultists blades can have this. All it is, is the serated blade or bladed blade mod, the problem is said weapons are not supose to have mods so some times they glitch and have them. 
---
Any time I find a perch, enemy hordes just wander off. Even as I‚Äôm shooting them. 
---
Skyrim's PR team would like to have a word with you.
---
thank you for your service
---
Bless u, may all of your cats have 18 lives
---
No power armor, all fine, put on power armor, overencumbered. This is how you fail
---
Today he appeared twice at the munitions dump. Both times during an event to defend the place. 
---
Aw, I'm sorry. Did I hurt your little snowflake feelings? I'm really sorry. I'm sure you have a lil safe corner or room to go cry in though. So no harm done right? 
---
Yes place a switch directly NEXT to the interior switch. Wire that switch to the middle of the door. Now, provide power to both switches independently. Now when you hit the switch you made it will open the door and hold it open forever and then you can also reach it from the outside to close it 
---
Are you on ps4? Add me S0l1d5nake666, I have the mr fuzzy costume and mask, but I never used them to be honest . I already stopped playing the game for now ( I‚Äôm waiting for the pvp servers ) , so I‚Äôll be glad to give you the costume, because it takes a while to farm for all this tokens .

I'm not one to jump on bandwagons but this seems like it *could be* a legitimate problem with cheat detection triggering incorrectly. Especially since the emails say 100,000 (one hundred).  Was there something triggered by having 100 stimpacks/nuka/flux or something, when it should have been 100,000?
---
At any rate the best thing for everyone in this thread and your Twitter mentions would be a clear statement about what's going on.
---
Well they say Rome wasn‚Äôt built in a day...
---
if ur low level, not much will attack u. Cuz u most likely wouldn't have enough junk or caps to justify the raid.
---
people dont pvp me unless I shoot them
---
FWIW, that was specifically from the Forbidden Knowledge quest, one of the rare drops when you turn in Technical Data at Camp Venture, and it is immediately repeatable with more Technical Data. Just providing more details.
---
Totally read the first 3 paragraphs, scrolled down to see some of the locations and immediately saved the post. I knew without looking at the rest of the list initially. I'll have to read through later.
---
Saving posts is totally a thing, and it's great that it is.
---
But be wary of those who hide in wait with their sniper rifle, baiting you in with their turrets. Not that I would ever do such a thing.. no nevers!
---
Its not as fun as the chainsaw but hey
---
I play workshops with my low and high levels and 99% if people show up it's to help with the defend event.
---
I don't think there's enough eat and drink in there
---
They respawn.
---
I did some reddit search and gall-dern their carb-sarndid search engine but I missed this gem
---
Yeah when I started reading these responses, I couldn't help but think.. why would anyone have 100,000 or even 1million of a specific item? Even for people attempting to sell these items for real money seems a bit of a stretch. 
---
Ok he hasn‚Äôt responded so it‚Äôs yours! What your gt so i can inv you?
---
Yeah, last night I played till 4am (US centeral) and the last 2 hrs, not a dang person on the map.  I checked because I was going to take a workshop and couldn't believe it. .
---
Yes they are most everyone who has one has been duped at some point
---
Lol exactly
---
Thank you . Its appreciated very much.
---
Lol
---
This has happened to me. I thought I was going crazy. It was awesome to have a moment to just enjoy and explore without interruption. 
---
Shoulder led spot lights
---
Found a turret base once and over top of the sound of turrets stealing my spawns I heard the cry of a scorched beast in the distance.
---
I ran to find the beast but he followed me back to the turret base. I hid inside while the beast flattened dudes base for 10 minutes.
---
It was perfect I trashed his base and didn't even become wanted.
---
Laser Gun plans are available through Patrol Duty or much more rarely through other random locations that pull from significantly longer lists.
---
The Guitar Sword is listed as a Savage Divide item, and Plasma explosives are Ash Heap items (and the Overseer quest "Personal Matters" specifically references a leveled list with the plasma explosive plans on it, but its rewards are randomized). These can also drop in higher-level regions, albeit somewhat more rarely.
---
The other weapons you mentioned do not currently have a plan object to find.
---
If this was the case, I could understand. I buy up as many blood packs as I can, pop on chemist and super duper, and go to town making stimpaks that I give away to lower levels. But this lack of transparency in what's going on, whether they're closed for the holiday weekend or not, is absolutely as frustrating as their generic support responses. 
---
My almost 200 hours of playtime, I'm pretty sure I've only found like two gourds. Where the hell do you find them?
---
dydamas, I will be on on 30 min if that is okay
---
1000IQ play dude
---
He probably has a crafting alt.
---
Yeah it seems an odd choice to do it on a Sunday when they aren't as active. Even if they did everything right, that's going to hit customer support hard when fewer people are on duty.
---
I, uh, found it really cringey :p 
---
Perfectly ethnically diverse group of 20 somethings, far too young to have been in the vault, having goofy wacky time with ghouls and hot-foot deathclaws, watching an explosion that would have scarred their retinas. Blech! Just my opinion of course, but in my opinion I hated it.

Random drop from safes, and boss type enemies like mirelurk queens, hermit crabs, and windigos. 
---
I can confirm this. PvP is best method to farm mats and caps. Maybe 1 out of 3 players will have 200 lbs of junk and be dumb enough to accept the PvP. I farm 10k caps on a good day. Can't wait for Survival mode so I can kill players without restraint and all the crybaby weaklings stay in normal mode. 
---
For lower levels in the greenhouse behind the Hornright Summer Villa in the forest there is a gourd there you can plant and grow in your camp.
---
Exactly. Nuka cola makes sense since you can pop them for the caps. Dupe 25k, drink all of them, and you've filled out your caps.
---
(Assuming nuka cola gives you a cap when you drink one still, I haven't noticed)
---
Nothing else does though.
---
Hence all of the generic responses on twitter and in support ticket responses. I'm utterly disappointed.
---
The horde isn‚Äôt where you TP to, you‚Äôve gotta look on the map. There‚Äôs usually a few zones marked where it could be.
---
Sounds good just tell me when your on
---
But the daily is bugged I'm pretty your supposed to be able to do all 3 mini games and it's meant to be appearing consistently. The daily has like 50/50 chance to spawn every day for me.
---
You got the paint job for the helmet. That's the only one learnable via scraping. I leaned that scrapping combat torso and filed multiple bugs on it before I realized what happened.
---
Then ammo problem only occurs if you using underpowered weapons, the game is honestly balanced a bit on the easy side if you have a good build/ good legendary modifiers on your guns and armor.
---
Pretty sure Rome wasnt bugged lol.
---
Lmao good response 
---
Lvl 13 noob here, I could use some help with the quest signal strength. I've died so much I retreated to the forest haha
---
Yeah I think I might just wait until dailies are fixed.
---
Very extremely helpful I can‚Äôt thank you enough
---
A rift isn't too far from whitesprings. Next time I see one of those bases, I will run down to the rift and bring the beast up with me. With fireproof perk, damage will be negligible; Hopefully, it will follow all the way there.
---
Let me know how it goes. I am pretty sure this is what is happening. I would test it out myself but I have a sweet little set up I don't want to tear down.
---
My guess from just taking what we know is that on Thursday a system was put in place server side to collect data on potential duping or simply items created in the world. These "holds" have been reported as early as Friday and have persisted up until tonight even. This "30 Day Period" might have actually started early as Thursday when the system was put in place.  Unintentional client problems ranging from the use of super duper, server lag and specific items could created a series of miscounts. The responses people are getting are either automated or completely unaware of the extent of the problem.
---
it's from workshop defense that people do for you, or randomly happens with teammates actions.
---
Amen!
---
What I don't understand is, you don't get XP on turret kills do you? 
---
Whats the benefit of golf course bases? 
---
Or are they there and tag enemies and the turrets finish them off? 
---
What‚Äôs your go to weapon for PVP??
---
1. No, the only bugs left are mainly visual bugs like the occasional t posing, and sometimes enemies can‚Äôt be seen for a few seconds after logging into a server.
---
2. The atom shop has most items priced decently, I have gotten about 10,000 atoms thorough gameplay alone, you can complete the challenges that give atoms once per character created. Most of the items are rather bland, but there are some cool power armor and weapon skins that are nice.
---
3. The in game community is alright, occasionally you find griefers, but I have only encountered two in about 150 hours playing. The people are normally pretty nice, and often willing to trade for items.
---
You can add me Jay_31_
---
I usually play in the evenings or at night. 
---
I‚Äôll PM you my gamer tag, I could use help in watoga

Legendary hunting rifles.

I guess he didn't make it to the other side.
---
If I stay on a server long enough, I end up being the last guy in the server. Not sure what to do with 60+ fusion cores though. Are Player Markets a thing yet?
---
Flamer fuel needs to craft more, I tried making a flamer build, and you need to control the hemlock holes mantinence workshop, the federal disposal ground workshop, and the workshop by Berkeley. With the 4 acid and oil nodes, you can make a decent amount of fuel.
---
Wait that is not right and I do not know how to edit it. It is
---
Jay(underscore)31(underscore)
---
Not the word underscore, but the punctuation. It just auto formats if I use it here. 
---
Ya this is happening to me to but I‚Äôm on XB1 and I‚Äôve never duped in the game and I‚Äôve got 200+ hours played and I‚Äôm kinda scared of getting my account taken away or of the sorts.
---
God damn goblin trains at Valkrum dunes while all the level 10s grouped right by the entrance.
---
Just about lvl 20, and am in the process of optimizing a quick setup turrett camp to use at the golf course...I thought as long as someone got a tag on a mob, that person receives exp when that mob dies; is that not the case? 
---
If not, my bad- I'll grind elsewhere (sidenote- is there another spot that spawns mobs endlessly?); 
---
If so, then "stealing kills" sounds more like "I'm squatting here, have claimed this place as mine alone, and I'll tear down anyone that disrupts the pace of combat I prefer. Sincerely, ~AnAsshole"
---
I'm pretty sure Yu do get xp from turret kills
---
Maybe you picked up a bugged one, (sometimes items in your inventory glitch out and aren't really there).
---
MK II and III exist and work.  They are just rarer.
---
For sure, I'm on PS4 so no access to a farm account, I've taken some time away from the game (I'm level 154) waiting for an increase to stash size or something else.  I've dropped most my junk as low as I'm willing too, and I am out of room (even with a carry capacity of over 600).  
---
I cant throw another good legendary out just to make room, I would be ticked if I wanted to change up my build and was unable to because I tossed away a legendary simply because I couldnt currently use it.  I've done that enough already and regret it (the nerf to two shot and explosive together all but ruined the 4 guns I was  built around).  Luckily I had kept a supply of Melee weapons as a back up.
---
At any moment they can rebalance something and ruin an entire build, making it mandatory to stockpile points from leveling up (for moving around skill points) and mandatory to keep a backup set of weapons if the ones your using get nerfed.
---
For those who say just toss the junk out, I enjoy trying new guns that look promising (requires lots of mats to fully upgrade) and need a lot of basic supplies for ammo and repairs (which if not stocked become difficult to farm, need bullets and armor to farm to repair guns and armor).  I also enjoy rebuilding my camp often and in very elaborate ways, nothing ruins the enjoyment of that more then running out of materials half way through and having to stop to go farm more materials.
---
Btw not bashing Bethesda (tho they do need to do some serious work to the game as it's not going to keep players as is) Just want to enjoy my time in game instead of spending loads of time doing inventory management.
---
So you asked for spots we go to farm so I'll add mine.
---
Obviously Golf Club at white springs- Ghouls in general spawn far more legendary items then any other mob (regular ghouls carry them all the time too).
---
Harpers Ferry- My camp is here at the dam on the north side, East of the dam Megasloths spawn often sometimes in pairs.   Up on the Road is always a Hermit crab, drops lots of caps with Lever actions and handmade rifles in its loot pool, Occasionally it is legendary so I've been hoping for a legendary of the aforementioned guns.  A quick run through Harpers gives me any supplies I may need as well as a couple spots for concrete, tons of meds, and 9 (I think) spawns of receipes/plans.  While I dont need the ones that pop here I farm them for new people.  There is usually 1 to 3 Legendary mobs so that's always a bonus.
---
West tec and Larry's shack- you covered these but I hit them often as well.
---
Watoga- almost always a few legendary protections, they die in one melee hit with my current build and respawn constantly because of people zoning in to sell to the vendors.  Good spot to pick up lead and steel from dead bots if your hunting those.
---
Various swamp POIs - the ones around Harpers ferry have everything from gulpers to murloks to anglers, easy spot to farm with an occasional Legendary,  teleporting to them all is cheap.
---
Thunder power station north of Watoga- Always a high level deathclaw fighting a group of ants, occasionally one of the ants or deathclaw are legendary.  Ant meat can be cooked and eaten for a carry weight bonus,  little bit of extra weight is always good.
---
Crystal Cave - This one seems to only work out once per day or so, but all the already dead fog crawlers have loot and good loot pools.  You can run past the mobs you dont want to kill to collect all the loot.  Easy non flying scorchbeast at the end, only way they are worth killing is when they are grounded. 
---
The Lake South East of Whitesprings - not a spawn in location but it's the spot with a guaranteed super mutant behemoth,  hes never been legendary but he drops a quick supply of guns and armor if I'm rotating to vendors to sell stuff.
---
Wendingo Cave - occasionally the wendingo or one of the mirelurk kings is legendary and has good loot, its quick to run through and check just hug the right wall.
---
Otherwise the other locations you stated I usually hit as well.
---
That's most of what I remember off the top of my head, I always jump in to help kill the SBQ, maybe this list will help someone looking for some half decent spots.  Would be excited if they added some more locations with large monster spawns or good spawns in general, anything as end game content would be nice right now.  The most efficient place to farm legendaries is still Golf club at white springs, Kill the ghouls, collect,  server hop and repeat.  Usually 1 in 5 server hops is a nuke zone and there is a ton of bloated ones, legendary rate is crazy high.  Doing this I can easily farm 50 or 60 legendaries in an hour, but it obviously gets boring fast.  It is a good spot to farm chems and most junk (especially springs) ghouls often have pocket watches and chems as well as an occasional fusion core so there isnt a need to go hunt for them.
---
Events-
---
One lonely night (think that's what its called) - Always do this event, lots of easy ghouls and a wendingo, lots of legendary spawns and or boss spawns.
---
Armaments - This one pretty much always ends with a 3 star Mr. Gutsy, good spot for a bit of robot cleanup.
---
Uranium fever - enough said most everyone knows this one, if your there dont instantly kill the legendaries, let everyone tag them for loot.
---
Monster Mash - watoga high school, tons of ghouls spawn easy to farm, they like to gather at the theater and get trapped by the seats.
---
Horde Events - already discussed
---
There are a few other events that are less appealing but I run them when bored, like the prison break at eastern penitentiary,  drops a weapon schematic.
---
On the other hand, wanting everyone to start on the same playing field just because you didn't farm for pvp gear, reaks far worse.
---
I'm leveling a 2nd character using armor. My main is 50 cal using power armor character. So I o nly need a really good weapon. It's a bit harder farming/trading for a 5 pieces of armor and a weapon. Currently trying to finish my Sentinel/Unyielding set and get a good legendary rifle for my alt. Level 40 almost there
---
I got lucky and found a random junk pile right next a farm full of tatos, corn, and cranberries, with a shed that spawns magazines and power armor. I just plant a bunch of mutfruit at my camp, and I have all the adhesive i could need, cranberries for cobbler, and fusion cores whenever I fast travel back. 
---
what about people in other countries? Or Have we uncovered a secret conspiracy but big internet to take Bethesda down
---
Btw sorry....long ass post lol, was bored.
---
You do get xp from tagging but the problem is is that the ghouls will die to quickly
---
Theyre annoying, not scary. 
---
when u load in. Don't open your pipboy first. 
---
wait for a minute, then aim with your gun.
---
Once the gun is visible, ur good to go.
---
For some reason, i have this problem too, that is how i get around it.
---
I am just saying is you have to always been on the watch. I am paying for a 1GB by 1GB....and getting a 2MB connect drop.....my internet is $200 a month alone.
---
Yes but that‚Äôs not what I asked. I asked about the drop at the camp. Vendors cost caps, this does not. Just say you don‚Äôt know?
---
Yeah, except the people who found theirs legit. Believe it or not, it does happen. Nobody believed anybody who claimed a tse dropped for them either...
---
I found a MK III and had the same problem, I just assumed it was because I'm in power armor and I sold it.
---
Well I‚Äôm not trying to be harsh. I just asked a question and your answer had nothing to do with my question.
---
his character animation froze up, and he was using the perfect storm.
---
Yes but only once
---
I get what your saying man, but this is the only game i play that disconnects 4-5 times a day and that on a good day. 
---
Yes Aaronholt Homestead. I always make my first CAMP there on a new character. 
---
They are as rare as any other set of two affixes. Same rarity as a two shot explosive. I have seen loads of sentinel armor, quite a few cavalier pieces, and a shitload of assassin, but only one piece of sentinel with assassin. 
---
Yeah their broken just sell them 
---
The type of armor means fuck all. The important aspect is the legendary affixes on said armor. I would happily sport a full set of lv 10 Sentinel/assassin armor. The legendary affix is the same regardless of level or type.
---
Just like FO4, a lot depends on having the right perks.  With the right damage and crafting perks, facing enemies of appropriate level, it's not bad.  Especially if you occasionally swap in Melee.  If you don't take any of the damage or crafting perks, never soften from distance, follow higher level PCs so the enemies are overlevelled, and try to go pure shooting; yeah, everything's gonna be a bullet sponge and you are gonna be constantly grinding ammo.  
---
Melee, does great damage, but you take more in my experience.  Granted, I'm still rocking Excavator at lvl 45.
---
The plan is on the shelf next to the outdoor toilet behind one of the three buildings. The PA station is behind one of them, and if facing the station, it‚Äôs to your left. If it spawns, so far I‚Äôve only seen motion assisted torso, and rusty knuckles. I was curious if anyone has found others in this spot but apparently no one knew about it
---
I see a lot of comments talking about 'this isn't a good sign' because a server was empty. Got news for you guys and gals: it happened on launch day too. Its not an abandoned server and its not a dead game. Its either a bug where people can no longer connect, or a feature where the server needs to restart but wont just kick you off, so it waits until its empty and wont allow more connections. What it is NOT is an unpopulated game. 
---
I understand but what I am saying is it isn't always the servers fault if your connect goes from 10's of MBs on a WI-FI to 1.5MB's with a upload of 0.08....and you pay for 1GB by 1GB hell even paying for the 150 by 150MB connection that kind of a drop is unacceptable.
---
It should be in the game though...so dumb that it isn‚Äôt.  
---
Keep turning it in, it‚Äôs bound to drop eventually. I‚Äôve gotten it twice 
---
doit yourself. 3 perk card and hammer need only. drop all ur junk somewhere hiden, send all ur caps but 1 and destory the base. let somebody kill u and loot back ur junk.
---
So I cant seem to pull a final response from all these comments, I have received this same message am I banned or not?
---
Lol. I don‚Äôt know. Good luck finding your plans. 
---
Then switch to an automatic and spray the crowd...that's what I plan on doing.
---
turret make almost zero dmage to palyers...
---
Level 50 Anti Armor DCG with 40% faster swing speed and 90% reduced weight. I do 1200 dmg with it, 1500 if rad worms is active (not sure if they fixed that bug yet) and 2k if both rad worms and Strange In Numbers is active. Don't even need Bloodied lmao. I can take 1/3 hp off the SBQ in around 30 seconds even with 8+ people there. 
---
When a level 7 has and can use an explosive ammo rifle powerful enough to take me down at level 70 in power armor with one shot then attack my camp just to be a dick, it's the players ruining this game. YouTube losers are just as bad. Honestly I'd be happy to see them all banned. They cheat, exploit, and then when they attack you and you get mad they laugh at you, proving they are just bullies who are to big a coward in real life to act that way so they do it online cause they can get away with it. Smh. That's not entertainment. That's some asshole being shitty to others and nothing more.
---
trainyard containers.
---
Well since now you know, if you look, let me know :)
---
I've been playing with my two friends every day this past week.  We all still get instanced loot.
---
Maybe she was just unlucky and had a couple empty containers or was in an area that had not reset for her yet.
---
I love Taco Bell, but you‚Äôre not too wrong, haha.
---
Are u still on? I would gladly use and appreciate the Camden park car. 
---
Low hp is king baby. Believe me when I say that DR and ER do NOT matter when you have sentinel paired with unyielding or assassin. Unyielding for pve and assassin for pvp. I would literally run around in the survival servers wearing a lv 10 set of sentinel assassin armor, and be 100% confident that I could kill anybody before they got me. Unless of course it was a mirror match against the same armor archetype. That would be fun as hell, and an awesome fight. I've never battled anybody whom I could tell was using a full set of this. Most people just assume you are hacking if they do no damage to you, and you turn around to snipe them.
---
Some guy had a lvl 3 locked door. He also had a workbench right next to a window so I glitched in. Went up to him and waved. Then I fast traveled on out of there. Wonder if he ever figured out how I got in.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why so many peoples use that weaker PA 
---
You must otherwise people wouldn't do it. 
---
As it should be.
---
The reason nuka grenades and orbital strikes exist. To deal with troll c.a.m.p.s  
---
Alternitavly you can build just in range with an artillery camp, and just throw the smoke at the turret camp's as they pop up.   
---
Fun thing about artillery it damages even if you have pacifist mode on... unless they fixed that. 
---
I am level 128 never wore armor pa or otherwise. I run ironclad and barbarian with a hazmat suit and stimpacks as well as an instigating deathclaw gauntlet and a nice 10mm auto pistol. Not great for pvp obviously but I don't take a lot of damage and I can farm whitesprings all day long taking few rads from the ghouls. Pop pharma farma and I never run low on meds and things usually die with one hit and if they don't I pop a psycho buff then they do. 
---
This is what I was thinking- like the objects inside your base only load in if a player is actually in there to see them? But I don't know anything about how that does/does not impact the server load.
---
Does the work on consoles or is this PC only?
---
Its nice when you want to take workshops and gain materials but dont want to mess with players. Its also nice when you want to farm enemies. If I find myself all alone Ill take the Munitions Plant, Grafton Steel, and Lakeside Cabins. That alone with my steel Node will have me set on ammo for a week or two. 
---
I don't have trouble getting suppressors, but I have scrapped hundreds of hunting rifles and have yet to unlock the .50 receiver. 
---
There were humans on the loose between the nuke event and your exit of the vault.
---
I like the fact that sometimes the wasteland is a lawless, cruel mistress where everyone you come across could send you back to the vault in a body bag, and other times you meet the most kind, helpful survivors but then suddenly, just like that... it's deserted. 
---
There is no one for miles, and it's nice at first. You're not worried that when you do run into someone they will kill you for a few scraps and screws. 
---
It's really is lovely being alone... until the loneliness sets in. 
---
For sure. 
---
I got all of them, if you came find anyone to help, I can in a few hours
---
Jokes on you I only have a tent.
---
I really don't understand dark souls PvP besides it's fun fucking with my friends. There's literally no benefit to it besides jerking myself off and some items I barely consider, just like 76. But like you said, dark souls is a single player game, the PvP is fitting because it's completely extra, I didn't even know dark souls had PvP until I got it. 
---
You're right, the system fits better in Dark souls than 76, but it's the same thing.
---
If it helps I've never been disconnected with Comcast
---
Not at all buddy!   
---
[https://discord.gg/Xr6ah5D](https://discord.gg/Xr6ah5D)
---
We've moved onto a new storyline but feel free to join
---
I have been really interested in removing assassins from my build. I currently run a low health sniper build (bloodied explosive gauss, adrenal reaction, and nerd rage.) as well as a set of Sentinel/assassin armor.
---
   My perks for damage reduction are; rank 1 blocker, rank 3 dodgy, and rank 2 fireproof. I combine this with a dense mod on chest (for a total of like 97% explosive resist.) 
---
  So five pieces of armor is 40% reduction from players due to assassin, and 75% damage reduction while standing due to Sentinel. The game has that weird cap on resistance so dodgy is filling the gap to make me "invincible." 
---
  My question is how I can and how much I can swap sentinel/assassin to sentinel/unyielding, and still retain my immunity to player damage? The extra perception and agility is attractive to my build from the Unyielding, but I won't sacrifice my defence.
---
It would have taken alot more time and money invested to make it happen.This game is simply a money grab to generate quick capitol for other projects they really want to focus on.
---
So annoying 
---
I play on Xbox and didnt actually have to use the magazines. When I simply found my 20th one it triggered the achievement 
---
I'm not triggered just saying.
---
I started hanging out with someone who is level 90 and I've just got 40. 
---
If he kills someone's base or kills a player who's killing new players he asks me to kill him to get rid of his wanted. If I'm not around, he will go up and shot someone once who's a low level and then put away his guns,  ring out his fists and try to hit them (but make sure he doesn't kill them and if he gets to hurt he will drop a Stimpak) until they kill him. 
---
They get some free caps, feel powerful and ready to take on the wasteland and he gets rid of the wanted.
---
If I have my mic on and I'm wanted I normally find a level 5-10, run up to them with my fists and start yelling at them "I have rabies! You gotta put me down man!" And dance around them until they off me. Once dead I respawn near them and say something like "Man don't take to many chems, they mess with your mind!" 
---
Nah, I like that the people for that extra carry weight is having to be yellow üòÇ
---
You dont get xp but you get the loot from the dead ghouls it a way of farming rare loot 
---
My theory is the complaints about server crashes weren't crashes at all, old servers just used to drop people when they got below a certain user threshold...  
---
maybe the patch removed it and the result is more empty servers, if I were still playing I would test it, gonna give it a few more patches to try again
---
Is this happening to you? I see a lot of people are effected by this! 
---
Its gonna be a weird flex, but ok
---
Me and a few friends he asked if I got banned , we are wondering if it‚Äôs a ban cause our weight is not too high 
---
Wasn't there a Firebreathers Excavator paint found in the files awhile back?.
---
Nice!!!! I‚Äôm a rifleman, so it‚Äôs an anti armour dragon for me. Only 414 base damage but with sneak and a critical it‚Äôs over 1000...
---
I don't know. If so it definitely needs to be released 
---
This is why I have pacifist on. Lol. This way I can just shoot at all of them with my TSE shot gun, cripple them and he can melee them to death üòÇ. Too be fair, I probably wouldn't have stayed with 3dozen ghouls charging me. Lol.
---
i play this game about 98 % single player 
---
lvl 270 btw
---
Bet its going to be released with the Factions system (i hope they aren't immensely stupid to release it as an atom shop item else there gods help them).
---
Played casually on ps4 since November, only regularly ever encounter small bugs like t posing scorch beasts or clipping through the map  compared to the rest of the subreddit. But i have crashed 3 times at least so its about as buggy as a Bethesta game is.
---
They're only available to buy from the command terminal in the whitesprings enclave bunker. 
---
I'm seeing a lot of tickets being put in for the same thing via Bethesda Twitter replies and many being told they were banned only after tech support tells them a few things like not to play the beta, reinstall it or hard reset, only after do they say they were banned. 
---
However I am reading something about trading flags, like too many.. not very clear but I do know that a lot of empty server posts and a lot of people can't login with zero explanation of issues... doesn't seem right.
---
Thanks! That gets me pretty excited. I‚Äôm guessing you personally don‚Äôt feel it lacks depth considering the time you‚Äôve put in. 
---
Did you know if you activate a vats crit, dont use it, then activate vats again your next shot will be a crit? This is why people like vats crit
---
I do it all the time. I‚Äôve also accumulated 10000 cap bounty (you can‚Äôt go above 10000). I barely see any more turret farms
---
Essentially hit the button that activates vats, hit the button that activates your vats meter, exit vats, enter vats shoot. Repeat.
---
500 hours into fallout and I finally took a break to play metro exodus. You can clearly see they polished the game out more than fallout, no question. And it has a fantastic and gripping story. Its not open world. But open world levels. It has everything we missed about this fallout, and you can see they put so much love into this game and I love it.
---
But its not fallout. Its metro. Theyre two different things, and I will come back to fallout eventually
---
Playing FO5 would've been ever better
---
One of the bunkers in the mire can net you 10 gourds if you've green thumb
---
Too many flags ?
---
The game has the system for paints for every weapon and armor, it is kinda sad they are so slow to make use of it.
---
oh my god your gamertag! many funny
---
I play primarily solo on PS4 - no major issues. Definitely has annoying bugs &amp; occaisional server disconnect (I would say less than once for every 5 hours gameplay for me but it seems different for everyone). I've done 200+ hours in game now.
---
You can play the whole game single player style, there are a couple of areas you will always run into other players but you can ignore them for the most part if you wish.
---
Vats does not freeze time in 76, it just makes targeting different body parts the lazy man's way - be aware 95% chance does not seem to be "to hit" all of the time, you can get a lot of misses &amp; think the 95% stands for "to miss".
---
Server support is the same for all systems - major patches are installed on pc first now for testing as it is easier to rollback/correct any issues than on consoles.
---
They really should have.
---
Hey I'd gladly take that outfit off you. I've been collecting rare outfits and was considering starting this grind. I could be very appreciative of it.
---
OCD?
---
There are so many things Bethesda needs to work on in addition to (hopefully) creating good new content, and you want the ability to place each vase, plastic pumpkin, dish, spoon, cup, etc. exactly as you want it on the table or shelf?
---
I enjoy building my C.A.M.P. too. It's surprisingly fun, but I really don't feel a need to get so detailed as to place every single small item.
---
For me, the C.A.M.P. is a mixture of functionality and your own personal desire to build it in a way you like. It's nice to put neon signs, a bear rug, paintings, etc. to decorate your home, but for many people there is a limit to it.
---
Fallout 76 is going to become some sort of interior design sim.
---
"Check out these nice plates and matching cups I got! And look how neatly I set my kitchen room table."
---
"Love the flower vase! It really ties everything together!"
---
And why
---
Thank you. This is very helpful! Little upset about the VATS but I think I can deal. Will purchase this game for ps4!
---
100lb carry boost.
---
It‚Äôs not a mutually exclusive situation. It can be caused by both - bad IP throttling your connections causing spotty play, and FO76 engine/design not being able to withstand these spotty connections. They made some changes early in the patch cycle for this i think - made your character completely immovable while it displays a ‚Äúconnection problem‚Äù. They need to improve on that
---
So is this a ban or bug?
---
I saw 2-3 posts on high number of trades between players, there is one in this thread above.   
---
I have seen players get the login issue even being under weight and not having a full stash so hopefully it's a server type issue. Fact that so many are having this is an issue all in itself. 
---
Yea it‚Äôs you ban 10000 people then no one will buy your shit so doesn‚Äôt make sense 
---
Nah, nothing worse than a carebear pretending to be a pvp'r.
---
You get XP if you tag it.
---
I'm bored, I built one and it's a player hub.  I have a switch for the turrets so you can turn them on or off if you like.  Why fuck my shit up if I got a stash box and crafting there for you at the place you will 100% be overweight?
---
I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE. I DRINK IT UP!
---
I'm reading post of both, I've seen a dozen saying they were banned for having 100k or more rare items in a 30 day period with many responding that they didn't.   
---
I think it's a bug in the flagging system that bans people or gives them the error but so far the people who have gotten responses have been banned or told they not to play beta or to reinstall and waiting for CS to respond.   
---
I haven't seen anyone get their issue resolved at all.
---
Somewhere along the early stages I got Marine legs....no idea where
---
Then I read I had a chance to find marine plans at Harpers Ferry and first shot got the arms
---
Then I was trying to find areas I had not explored and found the chest in the cranberry bog in a box I picked. 
---
I felt like I won a lottery that I didn‚Äôt act try that hard for.
---
Now the soul crusher....I think the first plan I got for marine gear was deep pockets!
---
I‚Äôm lvl 74 and Marined out!
---
Nerd rage. And if it‚Äôs melee you want unyielding armor and radicool for more stregth
---
I really would like private servers for 1-4 players with allowing multiple camps to remain saved on the map. 
---
Fallout 4 Season pass because it will add many new features and locations to the world you enjoyed.
---
Fallout 76 is going through a lot of growing pains right now with patches and changes to gameplay. Be patient and the price will lower.
---
Lol...keep up the good fight!
---
FO4 is too beautiful and vast to skip over. Explore everything. 76 will always be waiting. 
---
Thats the kind of thing you can do in online games. Yeah, the game has bugs and all kinds of issues, but some stuff is worth it. They have a good foundation. They need to fix stuff and make some stuff better and that might become one of the best games.
---
Your family sounds like a blast!
---
You too! Good luck....now if you see and legendary single shot rifles....I‚Äôm told they exist but I dunno if I believe!
---
If they set a weight limit from the beginning that a player couldn't weight more than X number of pounds we all wouldn't be having issues but we all know there are players weighing literally tons out there.   
---
This would have prevented dupers from duping so much for one.   
---
People are guilty also of picking any dropped bags up. So if you found a bag and picked it up you can get banned which isn't right at all.   
---
They let people off by taking all but one duped gun if they had it or take their Nuka colas but then ban others?   
---
I don't get it.
---
It's still stupid to kill steal lazily
---
 If you are gonna steal kill at least be there
---
Damn. If I ever saw you it'd be a fun fight
---
This. I can get 1700 plus out of my bloodied sledge without playing around with specs much. 
---
Lol that's pretty good.
---
And I actually rechecked. LMG did not offer me any receiver mod so those ammo would not be used for it.
---
Also bored and wouldn‚Äôt mind lending a hand lol. 
---
The Only 2 legendary hunting rifles I‚Äôve had so far were off of glitchlvl 1 1* bots when post nuke white springs gets weird at the golf resort
---
hopped this 3 times and got 1 can, 3 cans and 0 cans.
---
The whole first part of the game seems really well balanced where you can kill most things with almost anything. Once you go farther melee vastly outperforms ranged. If you want to use guns then kid recommend stealth because that's pretty powerful too 
---
I just got guitar sword as a reward for Missing Link, but Rose's quests are so bugged, who knows if that's right.
---
Nope if you have 15+agi and have onehanded melee / silenced ranged, you can shoot many times till they spot you. Also before it was bugged, if you get spoted, you activatec escape artistan perk by "recrouching" which make you sneak hidden again. I was stabbing 68lvl super mutants in face without being spoted. What a good times.
---
Well... just today I found a Furious Mr. Handy Buzz Blade (base damage 16, very fast attack) and was *stoked*; this would be a *very* good find in Fallout 4, indeed! Slow to start, but ramping up very quickly with near constant stagger.
---
In '76? Not so much. I'm still going to play around with it, but the few robots I took down in Watoga were not impressed. Damage seemed to cap very low;  there was no discernible curve in the damage dealt over time and no stagger effect. Level 50 Protectrons were able hit me three times before they dropped from a sneak attack (compared to zero times with a Troublemaker's Deathclaw Gauntlet).
---
I've seen a 30% cap tossed around forever, but with no references. If it's true, then this guy would be giving me about 20-21 damage when fully amped up. Assuming that it's three times faster than my deathclaw gauntlet, it's still doing less than half the damage in the same time frame. In reality it seems to be doing quite a bit less than that.
---
I'm going to play with it a bit more, but as of right now I think it's another garbage legendary for the (very large) pile.
---
Bethesda really dropped the ball on a lot of features. In no way does 76 have more settlement construction that fo4 but yet that is a big part of the story. Don't get me wrong I love the game but man they could have made this game awesome. Hopefully it gets to that point.
---
I've been rocking unpainted X-01 armor with red eye lights and either the skeleton mask/costume or the ritual mask plus civil war suit depending on what flavor of devil I feel like
---
Higher priority targets and not enough time to reach all desired targets.
---
Fallout 4 definitely
---
You can play solo n get by, wome things might be hard at first like some enemies so you'll have to learn to pick fights. You'll see others and not have to  interact if you dont wanna. But the only part you might wish to engage with is potential trading for stuff. Otherwise you may run into some for some events. The only thing you might not like is the way you play. You'll be stuck kinda picking a certain "build" to max dmg with a type of weapon. It's not like FO4 where you can find all types of weapons and pick all the special perks for all of them to be good with every weapon. The perk card system means it's more focused on what you specialize in. And swapping perk cards from say melee in strength to rifles in perception might mean youd have to rearrange special points. After 56(max level for gaining special points) you then can use a lvl up to get another card or re assign a special point to another one. Hope that made sense 
---
Do not buy fallout 76. They have lost their direction on what this game is supposed to be and are way to busy expediting the great exodus from this game.
---
I want to be your friend 
---
How much per for camp items? 
---
New Vegas is the only that has both. It also offers roulette and slots.
---
Though Fallout 2 offers all of that aside from blackjack. 
---
‚Ä¶..the area we are in alone has 3 nuclear silos able to on the fly produce more you would think you would want to target that....that is in addition to targets like sugar grove and Modus at the bunker for god sakes I just can't wrap my head around the Enclave bunker not being a higher priority target since that is where high priority military targets would have retreated to.

Odd. For me I always had to cover my cursor over the railing

There's something kind of satisfying about running across a new player getting ambushed and blowing all the bad guys away. I don't ask for thanks or anything. PS. I love my shotgun.
---
&gt; I wish I could prove that they throttle your connection speed back we pay for "unlimited" and don't get it as soon as you got over certain monthly G milestones your internet gets slower and slower. 
---
It is in your contract, and that "unlimited" is your data transfer, not your connection speed.

YEEAAAAAAAAAHH.....

I have my camp on the greens on the otherside with an Artillary setup. Its not pretty when I see a turrent base at Whitesprings.

This would make some sense as to why I can‚Äôt find them ü§£
---
Pretty damn good
---
Check your contract details, you agreed to the drop in speed after so much data is used. Get a better ISP, you are being ripped off anyway.
---
I'll buy 1 of each mutation, except 2 herd mentality
---
I am paying for !GB by 1GB that is in my contract I do not get 1GB even with a direct line running to the Modem....THAT is false advertising and scamming me out of $200 and THAT is a fact that a company up here already got sued for if I can 100% prove it.
---
May I ask why? I'm genuinely curious. Why rolling pins?
---
Just setup camp at a lead deposit, steel and gunpowder are literally everywhere. Haven't had an issue. 
---
but you have to ask if those silos and bunker were even known to exist if not been confirmed. after all it was sort of a proof of concept project and not a widely know thing and the enemy wouldnt want to go wasting their precious little time on blowing up a rumor.
---
Like I said, I doubt this will make much of a difference for most players, but I know that for some people it will really  add to their creative ability. I totally agree though, the assets given to us at the moment are great. It really depends on the person.
---
Nevermind only 1
---
50-100 camps depending on item. For example- an office desk will be like 50 caps. Acoustic instruments would be like 100. That sort of thing. 
---
I‚Äôll also take ammo
---
Does the season pass give you Far Harbor?
---
Yeah, Mt Blair Trainyard and the general area around it have a ton of them, both generators and PA, I've netted 6 in one go wandering around that general area 
---
What? You wanna grow weed at your camp?
---
Yeh... 3 silos. How many other identical silos are around the country? Not to mention, West Virginia is kinda far from China compared to the west and east coast which also have their own high priority targets, like naval bases. Id imagine much of the central country is untouched by nuclear blasts.
---
That is a really great idea! I didn't even think of that.
---
It fucking better since it's still $50 bucks
---
Picked up a bag right outside of vault 76 with clearly duped items and mules them...oops
---
[Yeah camo skin on hunting rifle](https://i.imgur.com/ccIhx0E.png). It is cool, ass all that crazy thing i spend 7k earned atoms on.
---
It is not uncommon for ISPs to throttle connections after so much data is used. It is in the fine print.
---
Also, you are never going to get 1GB upload or download, you are confusing 1Gb, which is vastly different.
---
holy shit, you would have been better off just buying the GOTY edition O\_O
---
Should be sprinting specifically. Have you had failing results?
---
The lore is super messy, but it basically boils down to the Chinese not knowing entirely because even a good chunk of the US didn't know. The silos are basically there for the enclave elite to ensure they stay in power, and vault-tec somehow knew so the sent the overseers on her mission to secure the silos. It's just a bunch of mixed up lore.
---
Far Harbor is awesome, the rest of the DLCs sucked.
---
Imagine you are level 400. And some guys choose you to kill you few times by claiming your workshop. Like 4times before you log off.
---
Is it wednesday already?
---
There are some good suggestions here, thank for sharing everyone.    
---
Hopefully it helps the OP and anyone else in need of some fusion cores. 
---
They made the enemys bullet sponges?
---
We don't, Brotherhood are those bastards attacking your houses. We only attack workshops, because that places don't belong to anyone!
---
They won't work if you activate them from backpack. Need to put them in quick slot then activate it from there, will work. 
---
I have this issue as well... Have 400+ hours and spend plenty for atom shop items... The only response I got kinda makes me think they didn't read my original email...
---
Sound triggered ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Simply for the humor. We are in this futuristic waste land with lasers and what not, to be taken out by a rolling pin is really funny to me. So I want to collect them.
---
And record it.
---
vualt-tec execs were part of the enclave. it would make sense to use the overseer to try and nab control of the nukes since she would be out of the vault before the enclave would leave their's (mishaps not with standing).
---
&gt; The days of 1 shotting everything are gone
---
Eh, I still one shot most enemies (even high level Super Mutants and Scorched) with Instigating + Head Shot.
---
Servers are still shut ut diesnt matter what platform you pick.
---
Game is about to die anyways so have at it.
---
no i wantws to clarify befoee i bought it
---
Hopefully we will have answers soon
---
tell him the truth, you just want to roll out some justice in the wasteland 
---
Well so realize that you get extra action points from the increase in stats, so dodgy will last longer regardless, explosive damage has been reduced so much that you're over protected to be honest..a few points in serendipity will easily make up the difference in the loss of assassin's, you just ignore 45% of all damage from all sources when at 30% health or less.. between all of that if you're really concerned there's multiple perks that raise damage resistance when not in power armor- the gains from unyielding work so well with any build that it's very much worth whatever sacrifice you need to make.
---
Not sure what you have in charisma, but for perk sharing or bartering you really don't need many points, I think lone wanderer is an option if you play alone, or tenderizer if you want a little extra damage.. 3 points should be enough for whatever you're running. Endurance could be a stat to reclaim a point or so if you're able, I only ran two points in it because most perks just don't benefit often enough..
---
You'll just have to play with it, I just don't think assassin's is nearly worth it for what it gives and what alternatives you could be running instead.
---
LOL indeed it's funny. I'll keep an eye out. I've run into them now and again, but I've always sold them to vendors.
---
In the thousands was probably old TSE single-shot guns like Black Powder, Gauss, Or the Dragon.
---
TSE guns went from nearly 400% over base damage with just 5/5 Demolition (base damage 100%, 2shot 80-100% depending on the non-shotgun gun, explosive 100% doubled to 200% with Demolition). 
---
Also, some people like to cheese screenshots.  They might have been doing things like posting with Revenant perk active, or with bobble head and/or magazine buffs active.  
---
Perk wise, don‚Äôt forget Bloody Mess and Nerd Rage. 
---
Roof of the maintenance building? Damn imma try this ASAP
---
Haha that made laugh so hard I woke up my wife

I should have. But they had the digital copy of the original for $10 bucks before I did the math. I was just do excited to play it ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

For the sake of the story, what are your computer specs?
---
&gt; and their first response to me was to try the very first things i tried when i began troubleshooting:
---
Kinda hard to get mad at that because that is troubleshooting 101 for customer service. To put simply, they don't know how dumb the people they are working with so they have to start from the beginning. They can't assume anything about people. And no I am not calling you dumb, I am talking generally.
---
I have a base there behind the club house but no turrets. It's more of an elevated platform to shoot ghouls safely from. I still get attacked. 
---
Check this thread, a few show they got banned saying they had 100k of items and that their account would be reactivated after the fix...

Oh that's unfortunate. There should be no reason for people to do that. I hope it stops
---
Okay. Makes sense. Thank you for the info. Not exactly what I wanted to hear in some respects if I‚Äôm interpreting that all correctly but thank you for the info
---
I don't mind I will happily murder them repeatedly for it but still.
---
Yea I saw that one , fallout 4 creation works so wouldn‚Äôt that mean my account is good ?
---
Yeah, as much as I enjoy murder it's still annoying to repair your base
---
Usually costs like 8 wood. 3 steel. Lol. They don't get far when I smell a fight
---
All you get is an automated reply, I got the same. Absolutely no help at all.
---
I like it too. Created this account years ago just waiting to shill for Bethesda.
---
/s
---
Ah well I see why you are in the situation you are in now.
---
Personally fallout 76 seems more for those who enjoy the exploration/lore side of fallout rather than the modding side.
---
also while fallout 76 can be played solo it is a tougher pill to swallow that way. you cant get all the perks at once even if you have all the card. you have to choose your "spec" (tank/dps/healer) and your carry/storage is not infinite so you cannot grab all the loot that isnt nailed down or you will constantly be over-encumbered.
---
Do it, you get 20-40caps for killing mobs around. Pay 20-40 caps for claiming -&gt; you get reward stimpacs,water, camp plan, caps, XP,...  after like two minutes there will be event, where you must defent it agains mobs. Kill them, you get reward again. So it is worth to just take it do defend and go away. Trying to get something from extractors is not worth, only one good for that on low level is meat factory on east of flatwoods. Because there is good source of food and one extractor of junk (you get everything even rare materials like springs, screws...).
---
Because it's a civilian power armor not meant for combat. 
---
I assume you're not on PC, but if I'm wrong, then you might be interested in my take on Quantum X01 paintjob revamp I made as a part of my Assorted X01 Paint Replacers mod. It's on Nexus frontpage atm.
---
100,000 of anything literally would have to weigh you down even if you have all the right perk cards played. 
---
After the patch you wouldn‚Äôt have been able to pick up anything else so you would have to dump it.  And even if someone else picked it up they would have the same limits. 
---
Brass and chrome would also be completely off the chain, but have no lore nods.
---
4x mined ore boost
---
$1,000 says they will
---
Was it easier on your own? 
---
Are the accounts BETA players? Like they‚Äôve been playing since then? 
---
My GT is "URHuckieberry". My mic is down, but I'm always happy to help if I'm on. Real quite server right now.

I got this "Greetings,

When I wrote them this, "Keep getting a "Login failed. This account is not authorized. [4:8:2000] I tried running a game fix, as well as uninstalling and re-installing the game, and changing my log-in. I bought a copy from GAMESTOP of the Tricentennial edition and still have the physical code (which is shown as activated on this site).
---
userid = Karthathan"
---
Quiet
---
That worked. Annoying that something like this is an issue.. 
---
Well dont let it discourage you. I tried my best to briefly explain that part. My personal struggle was in 4 I could keep leveling. And have all commando, rifleman big guns etc and pick up or have every gun and be good with em all. Plus you could store all the cool stuff you found. But in 76 you have a limited storage. And you'll be needing that for materials/junk to build or craft. Since weapons weigh a good bit it's not viable to store all the ones you find sadly. My one guy is severely overencumbered cuz I grab what's not bolted down lol. Your first character you'll see and learn more of what I mean and wing that one. If you make a second you probably learn what routes you'll wanna take for whatever build. If I didnt have to type I could explain things easier lol
---
I've crafted way over 100.000 ammo legit. I don't have huge stacks of anything apart from ammo, I did get the ban.
---
The one thread said he could login with his ‚Äúmule‚Äù which is an extra pack rat of stuff many have then after a while he couldn‚Äôt login anymore. 
---
I‚Äôd check later... could take some time. 
---
I‚Äôm wondering if they‚Äôre working tomorrow since it‚Äôs a holiday for many.
---
it‚Äôs not their fault that they‚Äôre spawning higher level enemies, they‚Äôre higher level players. it sucks but there‚Äôs not much you can do :/ 
---
reminds me of the other day heading to the golf house to search for some unruly golfer ghouls. Im at level 55 n beginning to feel fairly invincible to the fellas,, until they surprise attack me before i even reach the door lol. About 10 come running out, followed by a frikkin legendary glowing wendigo which ive never encountered there before, somehow resembling the boss zombie charging through in the final scene of i am legend,,,, followed by dam near 10 more ghouls. Dont know if they killed me or if the exploding cars in the parking lot did ü§£....best part, none were golfers lol
---
I know, not blaming them but to say it takes away from the game's experience is an understatement. :(
---
I took a picture of that, loved it. RV, gas masks, chemistry bench &amp; the works
---
Happened to me to, but it was only because i had my xbox controller on.
---
Agreed! But opposite issues happen as well. Ghouls feral golfers wouldn‚Äôt spawn so I saw a post to follow in low level players so they spawn and sure enough it worked. 
---
I‚Äôm wondering if they could level out servers so X level would be in different tiers? Like you wouldn‚Äôt have a level 1 with a level 150... 
---
ok
---
Any additional info considering the paths for the builds you mentioned? I‚Äôd like to be VATS focused so I was torn between choosing agility or perception at the very beginning. What would you recommend considering it‚Äôs no longer super slow motion anymore?
---
I agree. The world is great to explore but some of the decisions Bethesda made are mind boggling.
---
Are you in power armor? Haven‚Äôt really noticed it that much.
---
You won't think it's the best when Bethesda stops supporting the game due to nobody playin it.
---
That first lootable outside 76, vendor cashiers
---
There was multiple color excavators in the first videos and images of fo76 around announcement I believe. 
---
The game has no reasoning for levels, few places restrict creature levels to level appropriate content. The game sends you everywhere immediately with no regard to level. Go level up, and continue the quests. Nothing unusual fur a game, get here grind to go there.

you are harming your fans
---
Just because you are low level doesnt mean enemies will stay at your level or even near your level when you roam the map. 
---
And it should be if you choose to join a faction you are automatically in PvP mode with rival factions.
---
They toned back the melee vats teleport distance but you can still look like a hacker when you do it. Honestly kinda dumb.
---
Sorry, still new here. Didn't mean to miss so much! I'm on and anyone that needs it can send me a friend request.
---
Why? Why cut me off FO76? I‚Äôve done not a darn thing wrong. 
---
Just before I hit this error, I had an issue with some griefers at Poseidon, so I was going to server hop to start my workshops claims back up. As I hit Play, I got the error. That was hours ago and I have been checking my email; nothing. Logged into FO4; works fine. 
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been banned, but I still can‚Äôt play the game. 
---
No TSE? No shit you won‚Äôt kill it
---
We could make fine underwear with that linen.
---
Nope, not lucky enough to have one of those. Did try grenades. No luck.
---
Sorry if this has been already asked but can you put this on the x-01 Armour or nah? Ty in advance! 
---
yeah basically the same as mine...
---
OP what is your GT so I can fucking obliterate your base
---
Yeah but some raiders are just to strong to try and frick with. But the who is gonna get more caps game does work out in the dwellers favor most of the time.
---
I‚Äôve had it for four hours straight. Kinda got boring.... I like helping out low levels, and taunting higher levels. I‚Äôm level 87.  Most people don‚Äôt want your workshop anyway.
---
Rhetorical question?
---
Here's a tip, if you max out the Luck perk that gives a 80% chance at finding extra canned food in food containers when searching them, you'll get a ton of dog food. The funny thing is that trashcans count as food containers for some reason... and Whitesprings has tons of trashcans. 
---
original fallout games made me a jet addict
---
once it is working, it is indeed a fun mechanic. thats why i have one in my storage

Sorry I‚Äôm not elbow deep in the lore to know it is those damn brotherhood members. Thanks for the tip fellow raider!
---
It's an event. You get to go into a previously inaccessible mine and fix some robots to dig ore for you!
---
Keep them safe and get out before you are buried alive! 
---
I actually think it's a cool event. You should try it. 
---
Yeah I guess so 
---
Definitely wouldn‚Äôt haves guess you lock picked it since most people don‚Äôt even care about the perk...rip lock pick

This whole scenario and zero response for over 48 hours now from anyone in Bethesda Support or even any other public venue on what the hell is going on is embarrassing. Ignoring the problem will not help!!! I literally bought a PS4 to play Fallout 4 when it came out. I‚Äôve loved the series as a whole for a long time. Fallout 76 has had some of the best memories on a game with the people I have met. Now it‚Äôs just pathetic to have a company treat its supporters and consumers this way. Are we just idiots for even trying to partake in the Fallout series anymore as long as Bethesda mismanages it? Sell the right of the game to another company willing to support the franchise and also support its players. HIRE SOME REAL SUPPORT AND PROVIDE MORE OPTIONS THAT JUST PUT IN A TICKET!!! Live chat option or even phone support would be amazing! Do something IM GIVING UP ON YOU!!!
---
My best sales has been from stuff I‚Äôve found on vendors that other people dumped off. I never find anything useful by myself it seems 
---
You were supposed to say yes.
---
Yeah, whenever I want to go to an area and someone is there, I log off and back on so I get the whe place to myself.  Otherwise the when area will already be cleaned out.
---
Selling aids are we? You prostitute, you 
---
I had this problem when I was around level 20. The answer is as you said: server hop. It usually only takes one hop and so the loading isn't really that bad. 
---
Once I was taught this trick, I started leveling really quickly.
---
It's not exactly what people would want, but it works pretty decently. On ps4 at least, you can get the Spotify app and there are several Fallout specific playlists that people have made, and a few of them have ~450 songs. Those playlists have music from Fallout 4, 3, New Vegas, and general songs from the 40's, 50's, 60's, and 70's. You can also put it on shuffle so it's basically the same as the radio. Spotify plays in the background so you can use it while playing, and you can quickly access it through the... quick menu. If you use Spotify for free, you only have to listen to an ad for 30 seconds every 6 or so songs, which is basically every 20-25 minutes (which is awesome).
---
Get the perk that drops a live grenade from your inventory when you die. Then have either artillery smoke or an orbital strike in your inventory. Shoot their base once get the five cap bounty and then when they come to kill you they end up annihilating their own camp.
---
i also thought it was mount blair when you get it powered up? 
---
It is going to be just like hopping anything else. Sometimes you will hop to Charleston FD or Camp McClintock and only a fraction of the weights or clipboards will be there, other times you'll get the full loot spawn. Typically just means someone has already come through.
---
No shit?
---
People saying they didn‚Äôt get credit either did no dmg or didn‚Äôt let the game catch up to show their loot. I can run around the WS club house with only Tesla coil doing dmg and I get credit on every kill it tags.
---
Just started playing enderal. Won't be back to this until they add new content.
---
We all loved this game at level 20. Hell even level 60. It just starts to take a toll. Not great for a MMO Lite. 
---
Dupers whining, I queue the popcorn 
---
I know what the OP is on about. When I roam the Ash region every now and then it sounds like an earthquake hits.
---
I think it has something to do with the fact it‚Äôs a mining region with tunnels collapsing and stuff.
---
Definitely immersive for me!
---
Ive been locked out for over 24 hours now. Its why i made a huge post about my farming locations. Ive yet to get an email from bethesda telling me i'm banned. I've had a ticket open since it happened without contact.
---
Helps if you provide platform as well!
---
Sorry Pc
---
All good bro. Edit your post so people can see that on the main screen. Hope you find someone to help you. I won‚Äôt be one tonight otherwise I‚Äôd offer. 
---
Either server hop or just focus on low level areas. I had this problem a lot on my 1st character, but on my 2nd I took things super slow and explored all of the Forest, then all of the Toxic Valley, and just now finished the Ash Heap. Not yet set foot in any location in Savage Divide/Mire/Cranberry Bog. Because of that I‚Äôm level 40 and haven‚Äôt had any issues
---
I've been trying to kill Freddie for days. Level 68?!? No one was nearby, is that normal??
---
I've never seen the same effect. Powered-up The Rockhound is hugely underwhelming for something so large.

I'm almost positive it's the event that shakes the region but I'm happy to be schooled. :)

---
You use the code pieces to decrypt the launch code, however you don't need them when entering a silo or to launch a nuke:) all you need is a nuclear keycard and the correct launch code
---
My first few tries went exactly the same. There's an event in that mine that a lot of high level players attend. Just hop until you get the correct levels.
---
I AM THE LAW - Random 12yo on XBL
---
They‚Äôre both instances of pvp. They‚Äôre the same in that way. I‚Äôll give you that. Otherwise, nope. Not at all. Laughable opinion.
---
Anything more to add, or are you just going to keep blindly, pointlessly saying they‚Äôre the same and ignoring my points?
---
Actually, don‚Äôt answer. You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. Just do yourself a favor and go play some Souls pvp, and try to understand why it‚Äôs objectively some of the best pvp designed for a game in years that isn‚Äôt just a rehash of a system thought up 20 years ago.
---
Same happened with my friends and I, I posted a similar post however it was taken down automatically because my title was too short, it was ‚ÄúI love this game, why‚Äôd I leave‚Äù
---
Have you noticed this upon repairing your items over 100%?
---
I met my 1st one today...I heard her before i saw, scared the shit out of me...took every bullet I had....was an awesome fight...then...Checking out an event...it turns out to be another one...shit,,,all I got is 10 mm bullets left and Daisycutter with 2 minis...All I can say is ALL RISE melee...I feel like lobster tonight...Wicked, evil, mother futhers...
---
Would certainly be handy, meaning it will probably not be implemented lol
---
I'm on PS4. Obliterate my base. You won't get too far.
---
Just play fo4.
---
Love it! 
---
Ive farmed harpers ferry for a while, but found the size and all the interiors caused me to take longer than i wanted to farm it. That said i normally clear it out if im doing my vendor run.
---
I have actually got prime plans off the scorchbeast corpses inside the glassed caverns. The fog crawlers near the end are a good source of fibre optics too.
---
I pretty much farmed whitesprings or whitesprings nukes from levels 60-240. Thats when non bloated one exp got nerfed.
---
Battle Bot and Fly Swatter are also 2 events i dont hate. Battle Bot sometimes gives a legendary, both are really good quick events.
---
Lag and stutter are almost inherent in the Creation Engine unfortunately.  
---
Yes online doesn't help but making this a single player/offline game would probably take more effort than it took to make the game in the first place lol  
---
That's smart.
---
Any idea what level she should be or how to tell before I go in? There was no one around this time so I thought I was good, but level 40 mole miners and level 68 (or light have been 58) Freddie killed me twice already and I wasted like 10 stims and 6-7 radaways :(
---
I was thinking exactly that. If the servers remain wobbly today I might actually do a huge write up on each location.
---
I haven't had daily's trigger for at least a month now, don't know whats up.
---
I notice a damage drop when using adrenaline with the rad worms bug.
---
Yeah.  I was hesitant to go to WS when I was lower level and now I have trouble getting 7 more of those damn unruly yuppie golfers. 
---
A similar thing happened to me at Whitespring. I was being attacked by a bunch of charred and ran toward the robots to save my ass but then while helping kill the charred...  I accidentally shot the robots who then aggroed on me. I stayed away from Whitesprings for a while.......
---
The way we see Raider power armor appear outside (or inside) mines, I'm pretty sure that Excavator was just an improved version of "mining" power armor (which we call "Raider"). Raider and Excavator share the same mod options, including no jetpack option.
---
Thanks! I just love Fallout 76.
---
Yeah, basically been doing that after rage quitting when I try any of the main or side quests, but I have no  quests so just wandering around doing the same areas over and over to get back the stims and rad* I used up is so grindy...
---
There are no high value targets in West Virginia. In game our military installations are training camps. Whitespring bunker is a secret installation. Sugar Grove is a black site, which again, secret. For perspective, fo3 is based on Washington DC, extremely high value targets. From a military standpoint there's little reason to directly nuke west Virginia, especially because of the close proximity to DC. After military strategic targeting comes population and economic basis of attack. California is a very high value target in this respect, but West Virginia is sparsely populated. The only possible target in this regard would really be Charleston. There are plenty of high value targets close enough to West Virginia to cause radiation problems, such as targets in Ohio, Virginia, and Maryland, to alleviate any advantages of directly targeting West Virginia.
---
Well on the other hand, what do us high level players have to do, especially once you've done the SBQ over 50 times?  
---
There's a distinct lack of end game content, especially in 'high level' areas for us. Most people high leveled in this have had it from launch or are just diehard Fallout fans, we're willing to put in the time. The more people that aren't leaving the game even moreso so unfortunately until there's a more suitable endgame area/content, us high levels are gonna be literally everywhere.  
---
Yes some will partake in griefing (I don't) but yeah, as it stands, them's the breaks.
---
What level were the miners outside in the yard? That's usually a good indicator. Otherwise, load in and check the level of the the first miner you see.
---
I think I finally finished this around 25.
---
I completely agree
---
I was kinda angry after I collected a lot of the random misc items you find around Helvetia (steins, birds, house teapots, etc) and wanted to put them all in my little house but I couldn‚Äôt because THEY ALL WENT IN A STUPID PAPER BAG
---
I have my camp at Whitespring because I like the (relatively) nice flat ground, pretty location, and the fact that lots of people travel there.
---
I actually ended up telling off a friend of mine the other day that decided to built turrets on my roof without asking üòë
---
No I have not, but have been doing this coz my weapons break so much.... so possible. Have you noticed this? Is this a bug?
---
You giving these out on PC or console?
---
Hahaha. I didn't even know about the fictional character. That's pretty cool for Paul.I really do need to watch Discovery. I had just heard so many negative things about it. 
---
Have you seen the sheer amount of mines (destabilising the ground) and the sheer size of that excavator? Lol
---
What do you mean by spawn it?  If it's built already and you move, the entire structure is stored as a blueprint regardless of size (it can be glitchy placing the structures back down in other locations)
---
Do you have BOS Combat Armor plans? I've been searching everywhere for them! 
---
Ign: Looch_P
---
 Just had a visceral image of someone doing naughty things to my corpse after killing me in PvP... 
---
It was a newly discovered area. And I have yet to see an empty safe. I don‚Äôt know. I have not experienced this. She says that she saw all the items disappear as I was looking at the container. 
---
Same!!! Pls help!!! 
---
Looks like there are getting rarer as I am seeing more of these posts since the update. 
---
Thats not fallout 76
---
Confederate Uniform with either the ritual mask, skull mask, or fasnacht man mask looks dope as hell
---
If you really want to use blueprints I guess just blueprint sections of your base then connect them later, but I find the best use of blueprints is for turret setups and maybe a foundation with a crafting table and stash boxes for workshops
---
Check the map and see who is there at WS... if no one above 50 is there go to the Northern most spot and work down to the back of tennis courts. 
---
If you can jump up on the awning they‚Äôll be inside and on the ground! Got the remaining 7 in like 5 minutes!  
---
Ditto. 
---
if you have the perk to repair greater than 100%, you get a damage bonus that scales from 101-200%
---
Or if you have adrenaline perk it could simply be still active
---
A man is going around giving anything that walks his pipe, to the point where they put him in prison  only for him to lay some pipe on his cell mate.
---
I'm like a level 16, and have yet to encounter anything like that lol. Don't have any friends who play, and haven't really encountered anyone using a mic at all...
---
I don't think I've ever seen a miner lower than level 40 outside. Just unlucky I guess?
---
So hey this might not be a bug is what your saying?
---
I think they should just include an extra tab for static decorations for your camp.
---
Much like they have the ‚Äúfloor decor‚Äù section with the plants etc, it would be great to have a section for random decs to go on shelves etc.
---
Teddies - uses cloth and leather
---
Bottles - uses glass
---
Ashtrays - uses ceramic
---
If used as part of the camp budget, in theory it shouldn‚Äôt cause any additional strain on the server.
---
You get the idea :) 
---
most likely not :)
---
Yes, also on Xbox and all of my weapons seem to be showing less damage now.  My Gauss rifle used to do 240 and now it is like 180 for example.  I see it on every gun though, they all went down in damage.  I have not seen them go back up though.
---
Yup. I died and dropped a bunch of loot yesterday.
---
Spent 20 odd minutes faffing with my phone whilst keeping half an eye on the loading screen in the background in the hopes I might be able to retrieve it.
---
No such luck unfortunately.
---
I just discovered the charisma perk that cuts fast travel cost by 30%...
---
whats that spew shes shooting at us...poison...wanna be better prepared next time.
---
Ballpark figure on the mutation serums please.  It‚Äôs for my alt so I‚Äôm not wanting to go overboard but it‚Äôs weird not having marsupial or speed demon
---
One less bug for Bethesda to remedy hehe
---
PC tag: daddychainmail
---
Were they 2 shot explosive? If so you know Bethesda nerffed the crap out of any good guns 
---
Lvl 10 here, cleared that farm on the top left of the map awhile ago, lvl 15 shows up while I'm looting and all lvl 15 Mutants spawn right in my face. Closest I've been to dying so far. Can confirm, it sucks.
---
Orbital strike beacons make very short work of such dick structures... pretty much all my suicide bomb alt carries on him.
---
I mean... In the time the dwellers were in the vault some would have had children.
---
The Overseer even mentions it.
---
You really don't know?
---
Also, god pc and ssd make the server hopping take less than 15 seconds, so, all good.
---
Well, when he "chops up his cell mate", that could be rape.
---
Overseers Stash in Flatwoods. When I was new-er, I checked that box all the time.
---
BTW, video how I was introduced to Fallout games, buying it from "Fallout" to"Fallout 4" and gave them all a try, one after another.
---
P. S. I was very new to Fallout, said a lot of stupid things. Now I know better!
---
https://youtu.be/I5fhR8mjkng
---
There‚Äôs a link on Bethesda‚Äôs website about this, essentially you have to stash all of your cores and drain down your current one, then log off and when you log in it should be fixed. 
---
Same thing happened to me today, all junk lost. 
---
This is very specific 
---
I have some News about it, Bethesda (after some emails we exchanged where they accused me of illegally acquiring more than 100,000 rare and illegitimate items in the last 30 days) finally sent me a list of malicious items. 
---
It's true, I found them (more than 30 days ago) from a game container in a workshop without paying too much attention, and I found my toon overweight. The incriminated objects were about 70k nukacherry and 4k 5mm which I got rid of soon after (I admit I drank some nuka cola but I got tired soon because the amount of time I would have used to drink them all).
---
I admit my naivety/stupidity in not asking myself questions about it, because I found them in a container, but i did not duped these items (and they can check it on their logs, since I've never massively crafted objects)
---
More importantly: this thing happened more than 30 days ago, and moreover, as they have specified in the first answer, these accumulated objects do not exceed 100,000 units (as specified in their first answer).
---
Should my account remain suspended because I clicked badly on something I did not have to click in the game?  
---
It's ok. But at least tell the players about this and above all be clear in specifying it.
---
ps: English is not my mother tongue; please excuse any errors on my part.   
---
Haha I love that you match!
---
The game is great.  There's problems but the world is beautiful and there is plenty to do.   I got over 300 hours and I'm still discovering new things.   I also play mostly solo so you shouldn't have any real issues in that regard.  Happy hunting :)
---
Before I played 76 I would have said yes myself...
---
But I always wanted to share my morbid love for the post apocalypse with someone.
---
The least thing I wanted from a new Fallout was for it to be a coop game. Playing through a ton on quests with your friends. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Ask the higher lvls if they want to team up.  I usually don‚Äôt mind helping out.  One person dragged me all over the map!  I think I did most of the Rosie quest line for them üòÇ 
---
I've had that happen and the fix is to fast travel to a nearby location and hitting the eject button without moving. You should exit out of the armor then.
---
Dang dude, talk about getting into character. If you ever want a mate to play with lemme know, my man. 
---
I‚Äôve experienced this a few times. Pretty rarely though, so it don‚Äôt recall the specific circumstances, but I definitely have seen loot disappear when someone on my team looted boxes.
---
Hadn‚Äôt thought of that. I just got this tonight &amp; I‚Äôve been playing since the B.E.T.A.  
---
Disc
---
Its WS...who the hell cares if you're encumbered?!? Very short walk to all the benches and stash. There is no good reason to setup a bunch of missile launchers pointed at the building, what's the point of it? A real camp there with a couple of turrets for defense if something get through, fine, but 8 launchers on a platform solely to steal kills is just a dickhead stunt
---
No. The order of misteries will stop you. 
---
Big issue. The game fucking exists
---
It's pathetic that we are this far out from release and having to jump through hoops like this to just to play the game.  This is coming from a dedicated Fallout fan who has gone to bat for 76 up until this point.
---
Does it help your cause for me to comment on your message?
---
Go play with the Minutemen. They are more your speed. 
---
Lvl 10, about 25 hours in, saw 1 T pose and DC'd twice. Oh and bodies disappear after you kill things sometimes.  But it's all non issues to me.
---
Hey, I hope you're ok. Maybe delete the post after but unsubscribe from the fo76 main page and turn alerts off. If you need to talk pm me. 
---
it's unhealthy to live with such anger issues
---
They use the turrets to tank and distract mobs. If they shoot the ghoul once and the turret finished it off, they get exp and loot.
---
I feel the same way mate. I want it myself üòÅ
---
Hey man. My GT is NaturedMedal854. Ill be on tomorrow if you still have them
---
I‚Äôve had the Death From Above completion notice go off and fast traveled to the site only to find the queen dead.  Some people don‚Äôt mess around when it comes to that kill.  
---
I mean your post title literally says high level players are spoiling the game for you. Realistically you ARE blaming them.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat as well as a few others. BETA players also lost out on Xbox completing achievements that don‚Äôt register like leaving the vault. 
---
Only way around that was to create another character and do it. 
---
Players lists and friends list has always been an issue as well. Once I friended anyone their name disappears off the list. 
---
It will be interesting to find out. I don‚Äôt dupe and never have. I‚Äôve seen videos but that looked like a lot of work! Lol
---
I‚Äôve picked up bags people purposely drop all the time ( not like junk from dying) many 1 star items like at WS no one wants anyways, I just sell them. 
---
I guess if you did pick up anything that was duped, you‚Äôre just as guilty... meanwhile duper‚Äôs still have 1 gun and still playing... go figure...
---
I'm not fucking subscribed my phone hates me. It's non stop updated me about everything Bethesda does since the stupid fucking game came out and it's driving me crazy that I can't turn it off. I like getting most reddit suggestions but not this shit
---
Also maybe check out personalization preference in settings. 
---
I just want to be able to make bread and then use a baguette as a melee weapon
---
Interested please tell me more
---
Goos frabah or whatever
---
Level 95. Not once have I encountered anyone who tried to steal a workshop. Most people won't bother when they can hop to another server.
---
Ah I got it! 
---
Honestly I‚Äôm looking for them also so I can finally role play as an angry house wife. 
---
Turn off the setting in personalization preference where it shares based on the subreddit you view. Sometimes I look at a subreddit from popular page and regret it for days. Itll be ok tho 
---
Tell Google to stop showing you Fallout 76 related material.
---
It would definitely be nice to have a ‚Äúhide‚Äù option on perk cards that you never use.
---
It gets somewhat irritating when switching out perk cards to have to flick through them all.
---
Got em!
---
The Chinese didn't even know there was the group called Enclave let's alone know they have a bunker. 
---
I love it! I‚Äôve had several times where I‚Äôve had no one else on and I just built my camp and travelled around, shooing whatever I wanted without a care in the world. I played at the fairgrounds and ran up and down the slides, played some of the games. It was really cathartic 
---
From the timing (seems to have started about Friday) &amp; the widespread nature of this problem, I have to think this is an overzealous script meant to catch dupers. 
---
As folks have said, since the weight update, it has literally been impossible to pick up *anything* in such quantities as some are reporting from their emails; though that does leave like a week or two window where you could have (email also said past 30 days). And that still doesn‚Äôt account for claims of erroneous items (like fuel) being in the millions either. **shrugs**
---
Maybe because a relative handful of posts on reddit and some twitter posts doesn't make for a plague?
---
Not to mention that a number of people in said threads have already admitted to getting account suspension emails along with the error and/or have admitted to having accounts banned in the past which is pretty much all the explanation anyone should need.  
---
The suspicious thing here isn't Bethesda's lack of a response, it's the fact that so many people are conveniently leaving out the fact they got the same suspension emails as everyone else.  This is an automated system at work here, it's not going to suspend all of these accounts but then only send notices to a fraction of them.
---
And the reason customer support is giving all of these abstract solutions like "power cycle your console" or "make sure the game is registered" and "run a file check and fix the game" is because it's fucking customer support and that's what the database they're working off of tells them to say when someone contacts them about ANY error.
---
This game is one of the very few where I find myself having to put my glasses on occasionally.
---
Ah yes, because a commercial about a bunch of middle aged people crying in a corner about how everything is dead is definitely how you sell a game /s
---
....I'm sorry..... 
---
Nobody talks about that fucking distaster of a build mode. Pls Fix! 
---
I'm still annoyed at the fact that we still can't get these things legit yet. I don't see a reason why they didn't included it in the release of the game in the first place. And by the looks of it... It's also the only none PA helmet that has an armor rating.
---
The Fallout franchise won't end. Whatever happens or will happen in this game won't stop a tons of people from buying the next Fallout game. And this is no way the last Fallout game.
---
Yes this would be great but I think they're more focused on making the game have less glitches. Cool idea though
---
I hope your right about it. I've watched videos about what's going on with the current game and couple of the people say that this might be the last one and one of them said this is the last game that they're making for the series. 
---
I really hope they're wrong about that.
---
Like anything, the people complaining are usually a small but vocal minority 
---
No you can't. The mod is sold at Harper Vendor Bot.
---
I saw the fuel post... I haven‚Äôt seen anyone even using it since it‚Äôs so heavy! lol
---
100,000 of anything even with all the right perk cards would still weigh a lot wouldn‚Äôt it? (Not sure about ammo, I always have to make it and don‚Äôt have bandolier yet) 
---
Yea I do too, but I also have very good weapons. 
---
Perhaps as far as realism goes, for sure.
---
As far as gameplay goes, not really imho, it would really make things too easy, expecially when you can already install a decontamination chamber in your C.A.M.P so you already pretty much don't need RadAway at higher levels. 
---
A man after my own heart!
---
I could tell by the way you walk. 
---
While I would love never having to leave my camp again when I needed to make my favorite food or chems... that's the problem, you'd never have to leave your camp again when it comes to making your favorite  food or chems.  The whole survival aspect depends on needing to explore to find the plants in the wild and being limited to what you can gather based on those specific spawns.
---
By now Reddit and YT have heaps info on weapons, armors, perks, builds. A fresh install beginner can grab all weapons and armor needed to grind lvls and choose perks for op build just from doing a little homework.
---
Three tier base without guns right behind the club?
---
If it's the one, it's the only base there I haven't blown up!
---
You still can manage sneak vats build for sure. Youd wanna focus on probably rifles. So mostly high perception and agility for sure. I'll try n find a build example for ya. You can always swap cards out for say full auto instead rifles. 
---
Magic school bus aka Excavator needs a hot rod paint job....something!
---
That is sorta my point; why dupe or pick up a shitload of something that is more or less worthless? 
---
I guess, in theory, you could get close to in not over 100k ammo, but I don‚Äôt know if you could legit grind that out in 30 days or less. Would have to have some data to crunch on that one. 
---
That may or may not be mine?
---
I‚Äôm behind the club, but further down past the trees.
---
Most of my furniture etc is Whitesprings style, and a lot of atom shop stuff thanks to constantly completing challenges üòÇ
---
It's likely they'll make more single-player fallout games while keep updating as the franchise live service online game.
---
West Tek is by far my favorite leveling place. So many super mutants to kill. But Legendaries not really...
---
No reason?
---
The fact you're talking XP and loot from other players is the exact reason I'll continue to destroy them.
---
I help the noobies... 
---
Not make the game a shit show for them.
---
Intel found in the Chinese Spy bunker under Mama Dulce‚Äôs speaks to the depriorotization of the silos (imho). Their intel reports that as far as they can observe, the silos are non-active and they believe the rumor that they are automated nuke factories is false. The leader is sending word back to China that the silos are likely decoys and don‚Äôt even contain active payloads. 
---
The guy doesn't have turrets, he just shoots with his own gun at his base
---
You on PS4? 
---
Switch 
---
Pfft, you wont get banned
---
The one and only time I took a workshop from someone else was when I had only one left to complete the challenge for claiming all of them.
---
I literally took the workshop without attacking the other player, gave them a thumbs up, then ran off leaving them to reclaim it back again.
---
what tier of internet troll is this one?
---
Huh I could of sworn it was about eating folk. I feel bloody stupid now. 
---
I wish. His sisters uncle works at Bethesda he said and they‚Äôre tight. 
---
Don't wanna sound like a douche, you seem like a very easy person to fool.
---
Shit tier
---
I am on PC. Those aren't official skins, so not remotely what I am interested in here.
---
No. I like playing co-op PVE.
---
Thank you! Rifles are definitely my style. Just happy to hear the online aspect didn‚Äôt really ruin the VATS. Not that I expected it to be completely ruined, but my entire fallout 4 was pretty much VATS like a turn based game or something lol
---
I bulk everything and kill a ton of robots for steel and aluminum since they don‚Äôt mess with me in Watoga anymore so it‚Äôs easy pickins! But between repairs and carry weights there‚Äôs just no way even with packrat perk. 
---
Guess we‚Äôll find out... post here when you do, I‚Äôll do the same! Thanks! 
---
You can add me if you don‚Äôt mind crazy antics...I usually run as a creepy clown causing mischief. Ally1argh

Gotcha.

Active in blackops4 and pewdiepiesubmissions subreddits. This dude is like 9 years old.
---
Wow
---
Can I have your credit card number, expiry date and CCV number?
---
I swear it‚Äôs to help keep your account active...
---
Correct.
---
And Fallout 76 is not Fallout 5...why can‚Äôt people comprehend this?
---
I disagree. There are a lot of bugs, and things that need fixing but really it's the players. From people flat out cheating, using exploits and glitches them complaining about it after, but mainly bullying other players. Today I was in my camp repairing some weapons when a level 7 player entered my building and attacked me. When I exited the work bench and turned to fire back, he shot me once and I was killed. I'm level 70, with pretty bad ass armor head to toe. When I respawned he was destroying my camp. I came back in with my power armor on and he one times me again. That should be pretty impossible considering the weapons are level matched, and anything he was even able to use should not have had the damage to kill me in one shot. We both had mice and of corse I was pissed this asshole attacked me and destroyed my stuff for no reason. Heard him laughing and say " I killed this guy and now hes raging " . They run around in groups of three as well with similar names. One attacks you and becomes wanted and when you fire back the other two jump in and kill you. Then they destroy your camp and take your stuff, then go do it to someone else. The players like this are a cancer on the game and bethesda will start losing more and more players due to this behavior, which they are actively encouraging. I can tell you this, I'll never play an online only sandbox game again, and I sure as hell will not pay to play one. 
---
Damn man you turned a videogame post into, like, Banksy art but in word form
---
You cannot get banned for game mechanics
---
Calm your proverbial tits
---
You a dev?
---
F*ck Mothman, we need a Cult for this beast
---
Awesome, thank you for this.
---
It‚Äôs one of the last two achievements I have left to get on xbox!
---
Foundation pieces cost more than walls, not floors (like 3x walls) so did you replace walls?
---
I know the one!
---
I've used it before, I usually leave a bag of legendaries when I use someone else's camp.
---
Captainoob on youtube does a fair bit of weapon spotlights for 76 and other fallout games. He is the one I would suggest mimicking. He had a video where he killed a 76 boss with lvl 1 rifles. I'd watch something of his and pause n screen shot his perk layout. 
---
I was talking to you, not him.
---
No idea
---
they really shouldn't, single-player games are a waste of fucking time, you either share the experience and make it meaningful, or it stays meaningless. 
---
Have I truly sunk so low? What happened to me man 
---
I know this is an old post but I unlocked BOS for combat armor today and it isn‚Äôt showing for any piece of combat armor. I checked the arms, the legs, and the chest. Bethesda needs to fix this.
---
I had great fun the other week when Whitesprings got nuked on my server. I was JUST outside the blast zone, and had about 10 players dashing back and forth to use my camp :D
---
Nah. 
---
You‚Äôve been awesome! Couldn‚Äôt have asked for better advice! Thank you so much and look forward to playing now!
---
I suppose it's more, the intention to not participate in said post. Just looking for scraps. Can offer most as I'm done building and upgrading until they decide to unlock more.
---
I have no idea. I never figured out what happened with my polymer. It eventually showed up.
---
Maybe try logging out and logging back on?
---
You get loot and exp only of you hit them, otherwise, nothing.
---
You have any preferences to the type of weaponry to use? Ie shotguns, light melee, rifles?
---
Honestly I still think the best way to farm plastic (and steel, in case you are ever running out of that as well) is to just go to West Tek, kill all the Super Mutants there and scrap their laser rifles for plastic (Gives 6 each iirc) and all the other weapons for steel. At least you also get legendaries and exp this way, something you won't be getting at the same levels in the two high schools. 
---
I did not :( 
---
I tried that. Maybe it takes some time. Could be some weirdness in the coding. 
---
Sure thing man. I‚Äôm on right now, username is Nathan_TK
---
I never received any email I filed. A ticket it‚Äôs been 48 hours and I‚Äôve never received any sort of infraction before
---
Fallout 4 had a limit that loose items stopped your ability to build (I exploited it though).Having 100 dropable items render in a base seems reasonable.
---
I've been in an empty server that filled back up with people before.
---
Your parents gave you an xbox instead of love so now you want attention from random strangers on the internet.
---
lol how the fuck do you craft over 100 thousand ammo legitimately? 
---
Or limited co-op with friends only.
---
No, I have still never gotten one after 600 hours.  I had a couple of two shot guns that the nerf killed so I sold those.  I had two explosive guns, an assault rifle that the nerf killed and a shotgun that is still decent.  But I am noticing the damage decrease on all of my guns.   My Gauss rifle was not legendary at all and it lost a lot of damage somehow.
---
Bro I‚Äôve had this happen to me on TF2 before. I was wrecking this n00b on 2Fort and he said that if I didn‚Äôt give him my Aussie frontier justice and burning flames ten gallon that he‚Äôd tell his dad who‚Äôs Gabe Newell that I was using lmao box and ban me from steam 
---
Dumb question: are you sure you‚Äôre server hopping and not coming back to the same one each time?
---
Half the comments in this thread are wooosh
---
As a side note, mystery veil also has the gas masks disease immunity even though it doesn't tell(it mentions it in a terminal though). 
---
Pretty neat if you don't want -2 perception and it looks acceptable for a cowboy outfit.
---
What's wrong with looking like bumblebee?
---
Can't be correct. I got my account banned and I have not played in over a months time. Nothing of this makes sense to me. I've not picked up anything or traded high amounts with anyone.
---
I have lots of ammo. But I've had about the same amount of ammo since early Jan since I've done nothing but gather recipes before I took a break from the game.
---
Yeah i played all day yesterday, and after a few hours the server became empty . Found so many plans and such I needed :) was awesome. But then i got bored and reloged.
---
Man if I had a full set of t-60 power armor irl I‚Äôd do the same thing.
---
Depends on what you like using, what kind of Armor, etc. Almost every kind if qeapon build is good so just pick your poison 
---
You got a link?
---
Do not throw away your 308.
---
I think you misunderstood what I said. People are breaking that guy's base for no reason because he doesn't even have turrets set up
---
There is also a single gourd on one a dining table in one of the two story houses in White Springs. I'm fairly certain it's the presidential house - the one with the destroyed bot in the living room. I used that one to plant a single gourd plant at my camp, which I harvested to plant two gourd plants and so on.

Hi, just make a new character, get out from vault 76, and do your "First Contact" quest = going to overseer camp and then to flatwoods. You'll get the Responder Paramedic outfit, scrap it and go back to your main character.
---
Yeh i thought i was alone on this til now i actually googled the fail screen message.. so we have a big issue here i thought i had been deactivated but nope as they all say not a duper. 
---
Looks like im back at skyrim again 
---
Repairing the flamer ~300 shot is even more expensive than farming fuel... 
---
That's not the issue. What he's suggesting is this: "Player A" puts out turrets in this obnoxious spot in the hopes of baiting a would-be vigilante. "Player B" comes along and destroys those turrets out of his desire for justice. "Player B" is now considered *wanted* and moreover hostile to "Player A," who can thus do full damage to them. "Player A" has been planning and waiting for this. He has his sniper rifle ready and probably pops some psychobuff before taking a headshot at "Player B," thus collecting a bounty for killing him. He then repairs his turret and waits for the next would-be hero. 
---
Dude.. get a mic. And ask those highlevels for help. They are so bored and would proberbly even give you stuff... I'd help.
---
There is also the adrenaline bug still out there. So people can be found doing way more damage then they are supposed to be.
---
Ps4. Is there cross platform play yet?
---
I live in California time zone. We can coordinate our times

Haha!

I have lined underwear and left leg.

I get it after 12 empty scraps, thanks all!

Oh! Thanks a lot! &lt;3 &lt;3

my username is Crazymalkavian. I am playing from Greece  (GMT+2 ). Right now is 9:48 in the morning (i am at work). What time is it for you ok? i will be online at 16:00 my time (6 hours from now).

I purchased one from the Flatwoods vendor for 23 caps. I see em all the time in that vendor.
---
Yeah, many daily challenges need rework as they make no sense. Gaining a level is one the laziest challenges they could come up with and you get that one EVERY day. 
---
Another challenge is to trade with a player or revive a teammate which is a bold assumption we all play in groups all the time. There are no optional tasks to either do it as a group or as a solo challenge. And don't forget to hoard all the bubblegum you find, cause that's needed for challenges, and not 1, but 5 of them at a time.
---
Add me. I'm just level 21 rn though. I'm brand new to gaming. My bf introduced me to it. We play FO together. ( He's lvl 38) You're welcome to play with us, or just me when I'm on alone. 
---
PSN -- chakra_bender 
---
Same man. I got the game about a week ago and it‚Äôs one of the most fun games I‚Äôve played. Hands down the best community I‚Äôve ever been apart of. Everyone is super helpful. I‚Äôm disappointed in myself I blindly hated this game for so long. It‚Äôs awesome
---
When the future seems bright and the few close-minded people can't switch gears to support. Take your stance like anybody gives a fucking shit. Good day and Goodbye.
---
i have a spare mask fasnacht for you! And i can give you a full witch costume also &lt;3
---
Yes, I have this experience with my bf. He takes everything. Ha. 
---
I don't get too upset though cuz he pretty much gives me whatever I need too.
---
You got 500 hours of entertainment and want your money back? Fuck outta here.
---
If Literally everyone looks like bumble bee it gets a little old. 
---
Why.. Would I do that?
---
Have you remembered to take your joy?
---
Make a new account
---
Show me on the doll where Todd Howard touched you
---
Oof, might be tough getting together then. I‚Äôm in California, GMT-8 I think? Anyways, it‚Äôs midnight right now. If the rain we‚Äôre supposed to get holds up, I won‚Äôt have to go to work and I‚Äôll be able to get on. Besides that, ya don‚Äôt gotta pay me for it. Just something that‚Äôs taking up space in my inventory, anyway. 
---
&gt;They take people's kills making it useless to even travel to the golf course and it's such a cheap and stupid way of grinding.
---
Not true. They get nothing when they are not there.
---
I also have a few spare treasure maps If you want some
---
It's just a rare paint. It's fine.
---
I‚Äôm still stuck on ‚Äúkill a wendigo whilw wearing a clown costume‚Äù done it like 8 times since November and it never registers
---
Oh, funny how when my base gets attacked, anything the turrets kill alone, never have any loot. Must be some magic on whitespring how they get any loot.
---
I kind of like the level one, honestly. I can't always get a level a day, but at least I know I'll get those 10 Atoms tomorrow.   
---
But yeah, how many times have I picked 10 flowers? Gimme something new. 
---
I have had this happen with metal armor mods.
---
Like the real Greenbrier bunker, the Enclave bunker‚Äôs biggest defense it‚Äôs is secrecy. No one would target a fancy hotel for a nuke strike.  What‚Äôs the point?  No one knew the bunker was there, even some members of the government. This mirrors the real bunker in that it was kept a very closely guarded secret until its existence was leaked. 
---
I guess I'll be server hopping until I find one. Thanks for the info. :)
---
Dude! Gabe Newell‚Äôs kid is such a prick! He did the same to me! Not In TF2 but at a gas station in New Jersey. He said if I didn‚Äôt give him my wallet he‚Äôd get his dad involved. 
---
Fucking dude took the whole thing last winter 
---
He asked your IGN. U chicken?
---
Like Nuka-Cola, Vault-Tec had deep connections to the government.  It‚Äôs also possible they knew of their existence because they were involved in the construction process. 
---
pleasant valley ski resort, not the station but there‚Äôs another vendor inside the resort building
---
Got any vases or magazine racks?
---
Bro...I‚Äôm sorry dude
---
I‚Äôm someone who just flat out didn‚Äôt get the game because of all the negative reviews. I have to say I‚Äôm loving it so far. I‚Äôm almost level 30 now. I don‚Äôt understand where all the anger came from (outside of the bait and switch schemes with the physical ideas) Gameplay-wise it‚Äôs the most fun I‚Äôve had in a long time. It really feels like you‚Äôre trying to survive the apocalypse
---
Sweet thank you very much I been wondering around for hours now 
---
Since I just asked them if this were true, i no longer have reason to doubt you.
---
That is what I've also thought about doing. Don't know if it would work because people are lazy, stupid and some just like to fuck your base no matter what reason.
---
Need to test it.
---
Nothing I just wanted to repaint it, it gets old after awhile 
---
I actually like those, because I'm on satellite internet and am a second behind real time. Whenever I find one of those I'll pop a bullet in each ghoul and let their turrets finish the job. 
---
I will send you a friend invite and i hope that i will find you :) Anyhow, thanks a lot man! 
---
Damned time zones, you make it difficult to play with my new friend! :P
---
Is the forbidden knowledge quest broken or is it supposed to take all ur technical data at one time
---
The best moment for me was when i encountered the fabled flatwoods monster. I found him while jumping off cliffs i was level 50 and i saw him, shocked and amazed my reaction was basically the tailung meme the whole "finally a worthy opponent, our battle will be legendary!" and like how i usually am i took out a melee weapon and starting hitting him. I had forgotten that small enemies get pushed back with mele weapons and the monster was on the edge of a cliff and i basically pushed him off a cliff and it died, jumping down i saw his corpse and laughed. It may not be as memerable as your story but it was a good time for me
---
Mining boost and has an extra 100 weight totaling to 200 extra carry weight in total. It‚Äôs the most unique PA
---
Lol yeah. But with that being said, I‚Äôm hoping I get to meet you! 
---
I‚Äôm reasonably sure that the Scorchbeast is scrupted with the event.
---
I‚Äôve done it three times now (myself and 2 friends) and there was a a scorchbeast every time.
---
Wonder if this could work well as an event reward. Like the BoS where you rank up, there could be some kind of mining event or side-quest where you gain mining powess and then earn PA colour schemes as you increase in rank.
---
I wanna paint the raider PA also!
---
Hey babe wanna go to the movies 
---
‚ÄúWHAT FUCKING SHIRT AM I WEARING LAUREL?!‚Äù
---
Your fallout shirt?
---
‚ÄúNO. ITS THE GOLF SHIRT. THAT I GOT IN WHITESPRING. ON OUR HONEYMOON. SO I COULD PLAY FALLOUT IN IT LIKE MY CHARACTER,LAUREL!‚Äù
---
Dude....I appreciate the support bro 
---
Ah shit dude! you should buy an extra 5 copies just-in-case!
---
This. It eats 308 like crazy and barely deals 20 dam with perks. 
---
I did it and it registered (i.e. went away) but then it showed up again the next day.  Not sure if it glitched or if they simply renewed it.
---
It‚Äôs such a relief to have someone suggest this because I thought I was being over zealous getting a few extra codes as backup. 
---
Was embarrassed to admit that but now I see I‚Äôm not crazy 
---
It went away for me too but came back the same day
---
There is actually a cuckoo clock plan. I'm pretty sure I saw it in the Responder Bot Vendor's inventory.
---
Most people wouldn‚Äôt know.   I didn‚Äôt know till this post.   I knew the dev room thing happened but never read more of the article since I‚Äôd never try and get in.   I‚Äôd of bought a few to scrap and never learn the pattern the way my luck has been going lately.    Scrapped a lot of marine and combat helmets with no joy.  Wagh. 
---
Isn't a GT for Xbox?
---
Hey dude, i have plenty of ultracite and screws and all the PA crafting/repair perks so I can fix up you if you need?
---
Np dudebro...np
---
If you're not into PvP:
---
1. Keep the back door closed. It forces the players out of their base to open the door. Until you close it again.
---
2. Gather a bunch of ghouls and draw them away from the corridor either deeper into the clubhouse or into a side room.
---
People have suggested leading the ghouls to the camp but the camp is so cheaply built, it'd cost very little to repair.
---
Bethesda, if you're listening, perhaps a wider exclusion zone around the club house would be nice.
---
I don't know. Higher luck does increase the health bar of the items and may also affect the chance of getting an any \* legendary enemy in the first place. Beyond that, I don't think high luck would get you a more preferred item.
---
What I believe happened is that; since Bethesda didn't check their perks really well, people were able to get these really OP weapons with the right perks and legendaries mixed in. So people got used to these weapons and such.
---
When Bethesda had finally nerfed these weapons and perks, a certain pick of people were mad because they couldn't just play and easy game anymore and actually had to try. That's where a lot of the fairly recent complaints came from. 
---
Other than that, people would complain about how the game was very buggy when it first released and still hold it up today. And yes it was very buggy even for a new release game but some people were just too but hurt about it.
---
Now the game is in a much better state, not near perfect, but much, much better.
---
I just logged in for the first time since the 24th of jan(BFGA2 release date) and have the same error doesn't leave much time to have done that in the last 30 days.
---
60k 5mm is only about 20lbs with the perks.
---
‚Äú They both had the marsupial mutation, and *I* had the stupid mutation ‚Äú
---
Me in daily life
---
I always see bandanas at raider vendors. 
---
I've been putting, and getting stuff out of the blue suitcase in Watoga train station for weeks. That and Whitesprings are good spots. It does seem to happen at places like Harpers Ferry, as well. The wooden box  thing in the van outside of the Brotherhood vendor in Watoga also has stuff sometimes. 
---
Quick tip: Always mention which platform
---
Eagle eyes mutation give +4 perception and +25% crit damage
---
This was how it was much earlier on. I think Bethesda nerfed this intentionally to add more friction to the quest's XP and item rewards.
---
Perks 
---
Max out on rifle damage perks 
---
pick up rank 3 of tank killer. 
---
Silencer with mr. sandman perk.
---
Bloody mess level three 
---
Adrenaline level 5
---
If you want more damage at the expense of health get adrenal reaction mutation, a bloody rifle variant, and nerd rage. 
---
Put a hardened receiver on your rifle 
---
I remember when they said "We Happy Few" would be playable in VR. That was a lie. They all lie about it
---
I only do that with ammo and low level stuff. Or I just straight up find a person the level of whatever I've got and give it to them. It's fun, like I'm Santa. :p
---
It already is one of the best games. 
---
If I had the code I would finish it for them, free of charge
---
 Could Bethesda release the West Virginia map as a new DLC for fallout 4? Cause PHUCK your crappy arse game as a service shenanigans.
---
They weren't removed during that dupe patch last week so as far as I see it that would have been a legitimate purchase from the vendor.
---
Lol "offensive as possible" wasn't very offensive
---
Why dont you fight me then. U chicken?
---
Xbox?
---
The paint for the pa is a forbidden knowledge quest reward, you're safe :)
---
Perks like what others have said. Always shoot from crouch and being hidden or under warning. They count as sneak attacks. So maximize sneak attack damage. 
---
This, this and this. Takes 10min tops.
---
What platform cause I‚Äôd totally buy that instigating golf club
---
Xbox
---
Still have mine.. maybe I should try..
---
That's nice dear.
---
Yeah
---
Do you have the plans for them? 
---
I have the underarmor, just after BOS bcombat armour plans. 
---
We need a wanted section.  I'm pretty sure that I dropped a Bloodied Meat Hook a week or so ago after one of my runs at White Springs.  If I see one again, I'll check here to see if you are still looking.
---
That‚Äôs a fun way of putting it. 
---
‚ÄúWoosh! Glad that didn‚Äôt happen to me!‚Äù 
---
Thats what they‚Äôre saying after reading my post, I appreciate your way of making a crappy situation get a bit of funny thrown in to make it not seem as bad
---
Telling us what platform you‚Äôre on would help. I tried adding you and got told that your account doesn‚Äôt exist, so you‚Äôre not on pc at least. And as a suggestion, claiming the Poseidon workshop and just hanging out there for an hour or two will really help you out.  
---
They fixed the explosive bobblehead stacking, but the notes were too specific. Many assumed they fixed all bobblehead stacking, but it might be still possible to stack small arms or melee bobbleheads. I don't have 2+ bobbleheads of the same type but I'll test it out once I can.
---
I'm not sure about the adrenaline glitch; the one I know afaik it is just a client side fluke and does not really increase solo damage. Unless it works differently with multiple people attacking the same target, like SBQ.
---
I have the plans for the I underwear and left leg
---
Oh I‚Äôm PS4
---
This idea is essentially front and center in my full feedback post replying to the Jan 1 inside the vault. I never played any Bethesda games but it‚Äôs clear that placing objects decoratively is a function everyone loves, and there is an amazing potential for organizational / item transfer / utility containers that could also even be displays too. My /u is always open and my important idea posts are pinned there
---
Yeah my bad
---
I'll jump on and give you a couple.
---
Sorry! figured saying gamertag would be enough to indicate xbox.
---
Not everyone can get perfectly preserved pie ...
---
Good karma. I have lotsa screws on xbox1!üí™üèª‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I was travelling around trying to give my spare power armors away one night and I came upon a wanderer getting swarmed by scorched. I helped her out from a distance and while I was reloading I saw one more scorched run up to her. I said ‚Äúhey Wanderer behind you!‚Äù 
---
She slowly turned and yelled ‚Äúoh wha-AHHH!‚Äù And I guess a bunch of ghouls spawned around her. I helped her clear them out and had a great laugh. 
---
That would be fantastic!
---
Well in my point of view there should be paintjobs for all PA (I've never had a single piece of Ultracite, i don't know if it's paintable). I think that nobody in Appalachia knew about the X-01 before the Modus gift. So who made painthobs for this mechanical monster? Vault Dwellers. There should be paintjobs for all Power Armors because we, the Vault 76 dwellers, can use them. So we can paint them! The fact that you need plans, is more a gameplay reason for me
---
Are you angry because you don't know how to navigate an app?
---
It is still possible that other players farmed that server before they left so not everyone will be lucky enough to get items, clear places, ect. I guess if you are alone for 8 hours things will respawn. Honestly I never have an issue of someone trying to take a workshop I claimed nor do I run into other players that often. Though I am curious about being on a server alone for a few hours.
---
I‚Äôve had no major probs on Xbox, I‚Äôm lvl 160 with over 500 hrs played and they‚Äôve all been solo, I‚Äôve found playing solo gives great immersion and I really took my time working through the quests and listening to every holotape and reading every note, I imagine it‚Äôs a bit difficult to soak up the atmosphere of the holotapes if your in party with friends and everyone‚Äôs chatting so I decided from the start I was going to explore the wasteland alone and I‚Äôve no regrets. Absolutely love this game and I‚Äôm a massive fallout 4 fan too üëç
---
Yeah, get me a few just-in-case man!
---
Oh shit what 
---
But that still relies on vats for the criteria build part of it
---
Hey now, the Atom shop had a lot of thought go into it.
---
Yea this post is weird making to the front page. So you like playing single player games? That's fine and all but I don't think that's what this game is about.
---
 I personally love having a bunch of people on my server it makes the fallout experience seem a little less lonely. Even if I don't like to team up with people i know there are others playing the game and they are not just gonna ask me if I have seen this other settlement if I decide to talk with them. 
---
Except you won't aways get a lot of items since others can grab them before they leave. Not sure how often things respawn though.
---
Just messaged you. You're greyed out to join game
---
I have all of the first paragraph with the exception of adrenaline level 5 
---
I never use mutations, what does it do? 
---
This was a joke I came up with to talk to a girl about naming our firstborn Aluminum Linoleum once they make it even more like the sims and implement BABIES. I was up very late. It was a good time.
---
I might have a set of C. Shocks for X01 I got through server hopping, I‚Äôll double check and let you know!
---
Yes absolutely have most perks mentioned and a ton of sneak peeks too. I‚Äôve maximized the base rifleman stuff but I‚Äôm looking to see how I can stack more damage on it. 
---
Tonka armour best armour.
---
I see I see, does the +4 perception add onto the rifleman damage then? 
---
You activate PvP by activating a workshop. Of course it is meant for workshops. It even says in the warning that people may try take it from you.
---
Using it as a crutch to grief someone because.... well it is in the game so we must be able to do it is silly 
---
Happens to me once per week. I solo'd the SBQ for the very first time on Saturday. It was way more thrilling than with other people as I had to dispatch the ground mobs myself. Still, 10 minutes and she was dead. Nuked Whitesprings but the Golf Club glitched out and didn't respawn the whole 6 hours before I quit.
---
Actually, I would pay money, say $10 per month to be on my own server.
---
Others have said. Eagle eyes, adrenaline, adrenal reaction with bloodied. 
---
It's a Bloodied Vats Crit that does that..... if you have crits stored up and then enter Vats and use the crit immediately you can teleport almost an entire screen and land the shot
---
99% of ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù on this sub is just so far away from actual problems this game has no wonder this game is so shit
---
The Lower you hp the more damage you do, in combination with the added damage form nerd rage, you hit for a lot of damage 
---
Throw in a bloodied weapon and you‚Äôll do serous damage, also the covert op perk for sneak multiplier is a must 
---
Are u on ps4 if so would u trade or sell lol
---
We‚Äôve covered all of them, go to top posts all time, or gtfo of the subreddit idiot 
---
Did you ever dupe?
---
I‚Äôve handed in quite a few and finally got the BOS initiate paint plans. Are there are more paint jobs to get from this?
---
Yes I only have the covert perk but that sounds awesome. Thank you for the suggestions 
---
No, perception doesn't increase weapon dmg, just vats accuracy. 
---
To increase dmg it's just the stuff other people said. Max rifleman perks, tank killer, sneak dmg perks, adrenaline. And then you can lean into vats using better critical, critical savy etc. Paired with hawk eyes increasing critical by 25%, if you are in a team use stranger in numbers to increase it to 50%.
---
The mines are on fire, the whole place is collapsing
---
*Wooo* It's your **6th Cakeday** JachoMendt! ^(hug)
---
No, but using the suitcases close to vendor and stash in the most popular train stations is the next best convention. Buildable and also portable (in inventory like a power armor frame) Containers for this with a variety of item transfer, / hidden gift / secret treasure cache type utility are a main suggestion in my reply to the Jan 1 inside the vault call for feedback. 
---
This is a bug with Adrenaline and Rad Worms. You get your adrenaline up, contract Rad worms, and when adrenaline wears off, it deduces way more than it added. As far as I can tell, this is just a client side bug and you do full damage. 
---
You can see this by hitting an enemy that has enough health. First, you'll see a small health chipped away, but then you see the an additional health loss on the enemy.
---
What this guy said! Use your mic
---
We run 2 teams usually and gladly help lower levels, not all of guys over Lvl 150 are greifers
---
I have seen lower levels getting attacked by groups of feral ghouls or super mutants. I clear out the enemies and drop them supplies. Some stay and help a little others will hide. It sucks when a group of 8 or more spawn right by you or worse right on you. 
---
I would love to finish it for them free of charge. Upvote my post on mod / addon / creation club if you agree that I would love to do this. 
---
That is great..
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the right attitude, make people leave this game not just because of the bugs but because of the community, great job
---
Yup. Its straight up the best location in the game. Caps, 5.56 ammo, steel, plastic, rubber, glass, and a bunch of microscopes. The sheer quantity of mobs is unmatched by almost every other location.
---
More people than not actually have 0 email. And have a wrongful accusation of 100,000 items, as a generic message when all other generic messages have been exhausted. Have a few counts of people obtaining a list of accused items, and claiming the numbers are very off. 
---
Our community is great, we don‚Äôt need people like you that just bashes on FO76 playing, so gtfo of the subreddit and uninstall 
---
How much for the legs? Oh.. and on PC?
---
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm 60 hours into d3 trying out the season idea and the expansion for the first time
---
I like the co-op. Just not a fan of the pvp. But it's not a deal breaker.
---
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need our game to be rightfully criticized‚Äù
---
Nice
---
That's how you get single player, you wait for the game to die and play alone.
---
LOOP HOLES BABY
---
This is the only bug I‚Äôve got playing this game, I‚Äôve only got a month or so on it and I am loving the game but the loading screen bug is a killer. 
---
I know that about the "BOS Initiate Paint", the one I got though is a "BOS Elder Paint" (It's a bluish-grey painted version with the BOS Elder Rank symbol), think about Mason's PA in Fallout 4, well this would be the equivalent version. Can you obtain this version from the forbidden knowledge quest as well? 
---
Thx no problem 
---
Was your original comment good criticism? No it wasn‚Äôt, you provided no feedback for the game, you only provided your absurd stupidity
---
Server usually crashes once i arrive and do 3 queen runs. Players dont realize that picking up ALL loot helps the server stay stable. 
---
1. I've built a new home recently and after close to everything was done i wanted to remove that foundation and had to redo everything. A lot of roofs or walls i couldn't even remove, because it was attached to something. So i had to remove walls or roofs i didn't even want to remove. Needless to say i was pretty annoyed. (Bonus: My camp was completely destroyed later because of a nuke and me not paying attention :D)
---
2. This is something i don't understand. I'm okay with turrets take up more budget than other buildungs, but they should absolutely scale with your level. The perk you can pick should only give you more varity and decrease budget or add 10 level per perk-level to your towers. I do not have the perk so defending my camp is impossible.
---
3. \-
---
4. \-
---
5. Yes please! I really want the fast travel mat back. I hate fast traveling to my camp and spawn way of. First camp i've build was on a cliff. I guess you know where i spawned...
---
Yeah. Reminds me of BB when people would train all the gnolls to the top. or Lower Guk, or....
---
Yeah, it's what I'm trying to understand as well, if you only get the "BOS Initiate" from Forbidden Knowledge or you can also get more ranks from that. 
---
This is finally going into the right direction, thanks!
---
Actually Raider PA is just that, it‚Äôs PA the Raiders found and through over use and lack of any real engineers or military in their number (lore wise Appalachia Raiders started off as rich outsiders getting stranded in the resorts) repaired and fixed and ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù them, they are basically shitilly modified military PA. The Excavator PA is the only ‚Äúmining‚Äù PA in the FO world lore and was created by Garrahan Mining to compete against Hornright Industries AutoMiner mining robots. It was never released due to lore related events and is acquired as prototype files in Garrahan HQ. it‚Äôs honestly all really interesting and notes and Holos are found everywhere about it. 
---
It's to make tuning your build easier, since you can only equip perks equal to your stats, they implemented diminishing returns so having room for at least lvl 1 of a perk is worth it
---
If i log in and this works i love you. 
---
But did you provide criticism? No you didn‚Äôt, you provided no feedback whatsoever with your original and other comments. The only thing you provided was your stupidity 
---
It has shit loads of content. 
---
The thing we used to value most in pc games was shit loads of little details and puzzles to put together and having to write things down and sketch out maps. 
---
The zen aspect about studying a game like a discipline, inhabiting it‚Äôs space, freeing our mind from the garbage of life by interactive nirvana,  has vanished from so much of the games made in the years since fallout 1 emerged, but feels extremely alive and well in 76 despite the unfinished feeling. I don‚Äôt give a fuck about a moneys worth... a game has some value if it has any value, I can‚Äôt convert this into some number of profit hours because it‚Äôs a meaningless made up convention made by elitist assholes. 
---
I love 76 and how it somehow got out to use without being completely muted and ruined by said elitists trying to force the creatives to do it their way, at least it got to us around 76% pure
---
I got this when I tried logging in when the game was down for maintenance. After that I was able to log in fine.  What system are you on OP?
---
I received 5 friend requests , like 4 hour ago lol . I already dropped the outfit for the first guy that joined my world ( I didn‚Äôt pay attention to his name , i just give him that outfit and log out ) 
---
Read the msg above 
---
Switch server 
---
Thank you!
---
Jumpn servers usually fixes this. Otherwise they never forget lol. I'm guessing this was whitesprings?
---
It sure was lol. Thank you for taking the time to reply!
---
Well yeah that's true, but I was fine with all the stuff going down in game, it's just that I was looking forward to the PvP. Just knowing that there is no chance of winning kinda took the fun out of it for me is all.
---
I tamed 2 creatures so far.The first was a Megasloth lvl 40 (it occupies 10% of your camp budget) and when it died i tamed a 5 lvl radfrog hoping that it will replace the Megasloth. Unfortunately when the second pet died, i stuck with 20% phantom budget and i cannot build nothing (not even a wire). When i open the camp build, on the right i see the white bar shows "20% stored" but when i go to the "stored" tab there is nothing. I am waiting for the patch 6 to fix this issue, so that i can relocate my camp and build without problem :)
---
There is a static spawn of a police uniform at the Morgantown Airport, in one if the tents in the NW. Scrapping it counts.
---
Same. I feel like it just comes back everyday. Like the Overseers, I completed that yonks ago and it's still there everyday. HEAVY SIGH BETHESDA. 
---
What?   I don't understand.  
---
An event pops up.  It says "Horde". It has an icon just like all the other events.  I click on the icon and pay caps to travel to it.  Once I travel there the event disappears.  It's no longer active.  
---
Are you saying that once I fast travel to it, I have to run around the area and search for the the horde of creatures?  I'm genuinely asking because I don't know.   If this is the case, then they operate differently than any other event and differently than they earlier.  I used to do the horde events.  But since they kept disappearing I gave up. 
---
Could have just as easily been a server just coming back online. I‚Äôve been on dulling servers that emptied then refilled as well. 
---
Well that didn't seem to work. I hopped about 10 times, never saw anything in there other than like, basic clothes. Oh well, I guess I don't need those 10 Atoms. 
---
can i ask what your PSN is, id like to trade for some instruments for .45 ammo,
---
We need mod and addon support in the standard game and a full creation club custom server and content realm. I need something to do. Everyone wants more from the game. We are the only ones who can resolve our own wants here. They need to let this cycle perpetuate itself.  Only we can help us. Help me upvote my post requesting they understand this. 
---
Didn't they already say that was a bug that will be addressed in the new update? Maybe it's just because I already had the red lamp equipped right before the update hit, ha. But I haven't seen them in the atomic shop yet, have you?
---
Yeah, I tried the other way. This would have been easier lol. Oh well. 
---
why is ppl upvoting thread of same idea
---
Alt+f4 send a message to close the currently focused window. It is no different than if you right-clicked fallout on the taskbar and clicked "close". Alt+f4 does not result in the same behavior as a crash. 
---
Also, when you login to an account that already has an active session, the first session gets disconnected with the message that the account logged in elsewhere, while the second session is logged in seamlessly without being notified of the occurrence.
---
I don't like it that much. 
---
IMO, diminishing returns are best for cases when the given thing to buff is practically unlimited. For example, each point into small guns skill adds +1% at the beginning, +0.5 if you are above 50 points and +0.1% when above 100. However, you could grind to 1000 Small Guns and get +250% more damage.
---
IMO, If the resource to buff is fundamentally limited, the best is to have increasing effect, like you suggested, but at least zero-offset linear improvements. The Demolition Expert perk used to have a zero-offset linear improvement (20-40-60-80-100).
---
You make a good point. Never thought about Diminishing returns in regards to allocating special points. All though most perk cards in the game have no Diminishing returns. 
---
Its only damage cards that give you maximum benefit for lvl 1 and bleh for the rest. I personally prefer reduced values at the start and big payouts for maximizing the cards. 
---
Those aren't supposed to be in game players, those are supposed to be real players seeing themselves in the game. You see this type of commercial a lot, especially since VR has become bigger. Have you seen the Borderlands 2 trailer?
---
Yeah because they ban cheaters who dupe or break into the secret room with every item.  
---
Not from scrapping, but by plan. You can see all weapon mods and learn chances in my spreadsheet here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout_76_all_plans_recipes_weapons_weapon_mods/
---
Maybe they knew we would have to balance for weight reduction and didn't want to completely gimp us for combat. Notice some important perks only cost 2, like the ammo reduction. Perfect spot to put a 1
---
How do the Horde events actually work?  Every time I fast travel to one, the event disappears and ends.  Are they bugged?  
---
What what?? So you're telling me that I wasted my points in upgrading to lvl 3 
---
1- NOTHING
---
2- upvote my suggestions to add a store function so we can back burner any card we don‚Äôt see fit as an equip, and bring it back from there if we change our mind. Like stored stuff in the camp system. 
---
3- not have duplicating which serves no purpose except wasting time and bloating the ui, the next level up should be added to our cards regardless of pack or deliberate choice, and if we own all of them including the top level that one disappears from packs and the selection choices for Pick a perk
---
I kind of like what you mentioned here. It would be neat if perk cards for damage worked like barbarian or evasive. The higher your special points, the more potenail damage you can get from that card. Which would make getting more perception in your build something more valuable since perception doesn't give you damage like strength does for melee. 
---
Depends how you view your build. If you want maximum damage then lvl3 cards are the best. If you want best value per point allocation though... its probably not the best for min/max'ing a build (at least for pvp). 
---
Most of the people who will play this game haven't even bought it yet. It's a long term game that will be supported years from now. ESO had incredibly similar problems at its release, but no one even remembers them anymore
---
I‚Äôm still shocked they don‚Äôt actually admit this issue or issues about the action bar / ui responsiveness or customizability, why can no one show that they care a small percentage that we need improvements like this, like way before a new survival mode... so we could actually play that mode and properly enjoy it with a responsive, customizable ui and action bar and build system with functioning bobble and mag options. Eating them is not a good system. All of this needs to be fixed in a way that builds on this first iteration without losing why it‚Äôs great 
---
Not to mention:
---
The ‚Äòbulldoze‚Äô feature doesn‚Äôt clear most trees or objects while building.  
---
Trees and plants clip through buildings. 
---
It rains inside. 
---
Enemies spawn inside CAMPS with the smallest patches of dirt. 
---
Constantly get unsupported object problems. 
---
Some items cannot be deleted at all once placed.  
---
Power armor benches still glitch to the next floor. 
---
And about a dozen other problems I can‚Äôt remember at the moment.
---
Building is still fun but frustrating with all these problems. 
---
And all we have to believe any of that are people's word and without anything to back it up that isn't much. If this were a widespread problem it would be blowing up everywhere. But it isn't. It's hitting a very small but vocal number of people that are trying to turn it into a huge issue. 
---
Alright thanks
---
Gets scammed*
---
I agree, I mod low levels power armor for free my mats with Motion Assist, Optimized, Explosive Vents, and Database. For most players that Intelligence boost is useless, so Rad Scrubbers would really benefit low levels.
---
It's a balance issue in general, and if you spend the time testing out schemes, it can be worked out fairly good. Unfortunately, as many think, Fallout 76 was released too early with way too many mechanics and numbers broken/underachieving. They buffed automatic fire by 10% in an early patch, remember?
---
I know it sucks, but no one here can help you. Spam support, not reddit. 
---
Being able to turn 10lbs into 200 is ridiculously useful 
---
Yeah I have 20 of the damn things and once I handed one in it wouldn‚Äôt except the rest 
---
Sneak attack, the cards for that, and then adrenal reaction mutation plus nerd rage plus bloodied weapon type. Unyielding armor pieces are optional but fun addition to give you even more benefits to not healing your radiation,  where death was recently updated not to heal it beyond the lowest 24% of the hp bar. 
---
You can redeem more than one at a time at the same spot. 
---
I think the best community is the text chat mod people, I roll with a couple communities due to my odd schedule - players who like the same streamer that plays on these hours, and an rp focused podcast group who record our own holotapes and records for the character stories for added fun. 
---
There are bugs and missed features that are incredibly frustrating, but the elements that make the game fun, and zen, and rewarding as a character building experience, and also the reverence element about contemplating death and honoring the fallen, are all highly valuable far above any drag from the unfinished parts. It‚Äôs one of the only games to have captured me deeply, I‚Äôm the Games are my religion kind of person / player. 
---
Perhaps like me, people are used to the absolute shitshow that was base building in FO4, and are actually relieved that it is just a bit poorly done now, instead of a total clusterfuck.
---
You should make your own post about this and collect the Karma. Because that‚Äôs about the best idea for Excavator paints I‚Äôve heard ever.
---
You should bang your head against the wall at least 50 times so you can fix it.
---
If yellow was not my FAVORITE color I‚Äôd be a little upset too, but it doesn‚Äôt stress me much. But I am disappointed other players can‚Äôt their favorite colors, it‚Äôs just not fair. It was a 1 in 6 chance that my color would be picked. Though I got a sneaking suspicion that purple power armor will not be a thing any time soon
---
It does. I use MK3s exclusively (melee PVP player here).
---
You can farm a shit ton from Enclave Production terminal (enter via WS Service Entrance and go straight. There are 2x terminals at the end). They're like 195 for one without perks though, so it's a bit expensive. But Enclave carries 3, plus 3 normal Stealth Boys. Just hop servers (don't forget to use Hazmat first, I learned that lesson the hard way after I spawned into a nuked WS lol)
---
I think this should definitely be added to the US GOVERNMENT SUPPLY REQUISITION.
---
I have about 39 of those, and they're just simply to time consuming to bother submitting.
---
It would be solved if we can combine groups of 10 for better drops (e.g. legendaries).
---
10 US GOVERNMENT SUPPLY REQUISITIONS = 1 star legendary
---
20 US GOVERNMENT SUPPLY REQUISITIONS = 2 star legendary
---
30 US GOVERNMENT SUPPLY REQUISITIONS = 3 star legendary
---
The game is pretty amazing if you buy it for 10 bucks plus a few updates.
---
I always make a run along the dry riverbed from Flatwoods all the way to the river near Sunshine Meadows. Quite a few of them there, as well as along the riverbanks once you hit river. You could just start at the vault like normal and go the whole route.
---
Some store even give the game out for free... i can't confirm this but it was in some news because they couln't sell the physical version.
---
I found the Nuka World had a few fun stuff in it.
---
Nah, I have no probs leveling 
---
mutation or mutation recipe?
---
Easy to stay skeptical when it's not affecting you. Must be nice to be able to assume your innocents self righteously earned you a free pass while us sinners who have so much reasons to lie get cast into exile. Whatever dude no one has shit to hide. I bought, with caps, a known duped weapon. Bought like 5 diff ones. According to Bethesda, no infraction was made. And no communication on an explanation, followed with their REPEAT ISSUES WITH NUMBER VALUES makes this at least viable. You are free to not just take our word for it, but very arrogant to think everyone is a dirty duping liar.
---
I removed my Sentinel paint just to be safe
---
Probably some new crazy disease like fumble hands or something. Lol
---
Private servers maybe...
---
Mind you this is after I lost thousands of caps from tse exploiters via workshops and workshop pvp on top of the DC's with a bag out after a death, DC's on queens before loot loads and all the other times I got buttf*cked from a force not advertised in the game I purchased. I bought that shit to be EQUAL with all. 
---
no. bolstering is no match for assassin in pvp. bolstering is for pve.
---
A black one is in the game's data. It's coming.
---
I constantly provide criticism, but not in this instance. But I'm done with this community anyways. you guys are blind to being robbed or youre just fine with it, you're part of the reason the gaming industry is being slaughtered out for money right now.
---
Yes:
---
* lvl 45 *Bloodied* **Ski Sword** with *+40% power attack damage* and *+1 Strength*. (Watoga Protectron)
---
* lvl 35 *Assassin's* **Ski Sword** with *reflect 50% melee damage* and *take less damage while power attacking*. (Uranium fewer)
---
I'm on PC and I think I keep them stashed until Player vending becomes a thing. I just  can't make myself sell them to a vendor bot and not see some use out of these rare 3\* drops.
---
The Enclave made Scorchbeasts, which made Scorched, which killed everybody. So fuck the Enclave. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you support their ideals! Good luck with the RP and recruiting OP
---
Once you get a combat rifle or lever action you might prefer it.
---
As an alternative, it's eh okay. A straight up % reduction on damage is always better, but until you find those Bolstering will do. 
---
I personally use a full set of Unyielding AP Refresh (I'm melee). Trying to find Unyielding AP Refresh Cavalier combat pieces but idk if anyone even has those yet lmao. 
---
I have 450 AP, and it refills in like 3 seconds. Makes Dodgy almost always active. It's fun. 
---
Man I‚Äôd love one of those, I‚Äôm sick of wearing stupid hats with no armour. 
---
Depends on pieces. The assassins sen that‚Äôs marine thats going around is not the best. Marine is weak
---
Being a lvl 211 I can't live without my excavator pa, I want more than mellow yellow paint.
---
It‚Äôs called a metaphor buddy 
---
Leave out the girl part. You'll get people that only want to because of that one word and be weird.
---
I need this. 
---
We do support their ideals! Democracy and the American way! Unfortunately, we had a less than stellar elected official at the time the original Scorchbeast was created. If I had been your President, I would have killed it, killed it with fire, and twice for good measure! 
---
I downloaded 110 gigs total ps4, took me 8 hours üôÉ
---
Was that all in one or over time?
---
Had this game since release. Its a fun game, and the map is pretty amazing.
---
Over two months, another update coming this month
---
Rad worms most likely. Relog is the fastest way of getting rid of it (but cure radworms first).
---
So how often do updates come out?
---
Yeah I also saw level 90 something albino deathclaw in that spot once, led him to a guy by tennis court and we both killed it. Also saw a chameleon deathclaw 70 or 80 at same spot, different time, but it was weird it never went invisible before or during the fight.
---
It's hard to tell lately.
---
Easy, sold items for steel/lead, bought steel/lead, farmed steel/lead, then you use the Ammo perk + Super duper while you craft.  
---
Bought ammo aswell.
---
What would you say is the average update size?
---
The sentry bot helmet goes pretty good with marine armor.
---
Three. Levels 174, 76 and 43.
---
1gigs to 4 gigs just depends where you are.
---
it's a very good value for the price!
---
Can‚Äôt edit the title on mobile, but thank you 
---
Just guessing but you didn't go to the dev room and you didn't learn the plan so if you were me I wouldn't be worried.
---
only one, the one i created at launch, level 136 at almost 400h. had an alt that i didnt even reach lvl 20 with, i like to stick to one character at a time.
---
It‚Äôs what I like to do, I always did it just one character and I keep doing everything there‚Äôs to do on the one character 
---
&gt; Any word on what the 4:8:2000 error is all about that is plaguing the Fallout 76 servers?
---
Is it?  Happened to me once on Saturday --
---
Got "server is not responding", followed by "disconnected".
---
When I tried to log back in I got the famous error.  It looked like I was having problems with my network so I turned everything off (PS4, switch &amp;c), after that I reconnected and everything was OK.
---
so far 4. My mains 117, hes a mostly melee 2h power armor mutant build. I have a level 2 mule, a 17 who's going to be a stealth pistol vats crit build, and another who's also 17 who's going to be my sniper build. Probably build a heavy weapons build with my 5th slot. 
---
&gt; I'm not one to jump on bandwagons but this seems like it could be a legitimate problem with cheat detection triggering incorrectly, with the way the email is worded
---
What email?
---
I'm level 30 so I guess I guess we could do similar quests together without running into level inappropriate mobs.
---
Till you capture 5 workshops and the game crashes.
---
Yeah i have a bunch of them and assumed they were all just broken. 
---
For PVP it's not optimal gear. So, no.
---
everytime i‚Äôve fast traveled on the past few days i‚Äôve had to wait at least 10 seconds for the game to load after the two loading screens because i would get 10fps until everything‚Äôs loaded. 
---
also yesterday nuked the prime site and killed the queen, had to wait 5-10 mins for the loot to load first on the corpse and then 3 mins for the items to show up in my inventory, so i can definitely say it‚Äôs been laggy lately
---
Put stuff like plans and cores in the overseers box at the overseers camp near vault 76. First place new players go.
---
The best thing is - there are 2 parts of this song! :D

And if choppin' is about sex, then why is he having sex with an electric chair?
---
Also how can they "gave him back his same old knife" @ 3:52 in the above video \^\^
---
You say "post was hidden from search".  The post says "[removed]".
---
Which is it?  Who removed it?
---
Servers for me and my bf have been fine this weekend, the best they‚Äôve ever been in my opinion. Before it was super laggy and we‚Äôd be forced back to the start menu a good 4 timers per session 
---
I was really impressed by the servers last night. There was 3 players(one of the them had a camp right there) plus me fighting three schorched beasts while the ghouls respawned, in the Whitespring, and the game managed to stay playable!
---
All the time I waited for crash or something, but my it went OK. It was weird actually. PS4.
---
There's usually one upstairs in the Flatwoods church, under a table.
---
Just two, but one is a mule because I keep gathering so many materials and my stash is always very full 
---
This sub is now in "suck Bethesda's dick" mode again after the duping bug.
---
I like mostly everything, what is consider the meta currently?
---
I want one with working emergency lights and maybe even a siren
---
Yeah, I just have a T60 which is painted in a paint obtainable only (I think, I may be wrong) from the dev room. 
---
Lights probably take more budget because spamming them could be rendering intensive. Not sure how the lighting model in this game actually works, but generally more dynamic light sources increases graphical stress real quick.
---
It's more difficult to kill other players, aka it will take alot more ammo than it used to, how to solve this? Don't try to kill other players (turn on pacifist mode), and for the first 10+ levels - stick to melee as much as possible.
---
Thanks. I've been thinking about this for a while, as an event idea. I think all the cosmetic stuff like that doesn't have to be in the Atom Store.  I'll post and see what people think.
---
I agree with the diagnosis but feel the need to add some clarification. :) Since it's easy to lose track of which fifty diseases you're currently suffering from and most people don't notice the extra 50% but *do* notice when, for instance, mutations stop working, the "it's rad worms" answer often seems to require additional explanation.
---
Rad worms currently has two different bugs.
---
The first adds an extra 50% to all "active effects," including picklock level, for its duration. (If you equip all three cards while you have rad worms, your picklock skill will be 4!) (Also, this is hugely abusable.)
---
The part where most people seem to become mystified is when rad worms is healed, either by being cured or by timing out on its own. When this happens, all of the affected effects are reset to their default values: jump height is normal (so marsupial breaks), for instance...and equipped abilities revert to their default level of 0.
---
Relogging fixes the problem. 
---
I‚Äôve found that sometimes my perks have been unequipped when I start playing, maybe the same happened? I‚Äôll notice that a level has dropped on something after a while of playing really poorly and not knowing why, and then I‚Äôll check my perks and see that one was unequipped without my knowledge
---
You have a... suicide bomb alt?
---
ANyone tried submitting them one at a time. Would mean having to drop your stack except 1, submit, pick up 1, submit..etc
---
This game really does have some good moments...I think people are just blinded by the hate...
---
He is the danger.
---
I have yet to make one but I did get the plans from something, havnt managed to find assaultron circuit boards !
---
That makes sense.
---
PSN Killah420 me and a friend are needing help. Can't seem to get past repairing the mainframes. Like they patched it to make it harder. We just want to finally launch one nuke and explore the blast site. Any help? 
---
What‚Äôs in that pikachu can?
---
1. You need a code too (you can just look it up online, make sure it's this weeks code though)
---
2. Sorry I'm on xbox
---
Thanks for the great advise!!!
---
&gt; my first question is can a nuclear keycard launch a nuke on its own? 
---
No, you need the [launch code](https://nukacrypt.com/solved) for the particular silo. Fortunately, you only have to enter them once per week.
---
&gt;  help me raid site charlie 
---
My experience is that soloing a silo is doable and preferable as the enemies scale in levels/numbers when multiple players try to clear them.
---
I always show up in style. I never wear power armor anymore unless i absolutely have to go into a rad zone. And if they had more PA paints I would probably wear more PA. Where's this man's gold?!
---
ok thanks for the info
---
ok and is it just ghouls at the silos or is there more?
---
Platform and Time Zone?
---
Your welcome
---
I wrote the same like 2 weeks ago and I was downvoted onto the oblivion 
---
Robots. Lots and lots of robots
---
No, just robots. Make sure to bring plenary of ammo and stimpaks. 
---
PC and UK time 
---
Suggestion
---
Could we have some different flag plans please? Would be nice, especially for players who are aligning themselves with the different factions, to have a BoS flag, or a Responders flag for example.
---
I do. Every single time
---
Two. My main is 72, and the other is level 2. Just a mule for a friend with a bunch of legendaries. 
---
crap, i only ask cause im lvl 16 or 17 RN
---
You can use a ‚Äò/‚Äò right before each punctuation to mark it as non-format. So if you write Jay//_31//_ you‚Äôll get the right text
---
My kids are great we can get pretty silly!! Lol !!!
---
Yay! I‚Äôll add you tomorrow morning (: we have can a whole squad lol I‚Äôm level 45 and my boyfriend is level 50 lol 
---
Gotta finish main questline before you can launch anyway
---
I‚Äôll add you tomorrow morning (: 
---
shit really?
---
Both?  There are three
---
Thanks! Will do tomorrow morning!(: 
---
As far as I‚Äôm aware yeah
---
 Ale sure you block the higher lvl, this will guarantee that you get a different server when you come back in
---
Haha I love that you are in an argument with another zealot.  It suits you both.
---
This happened to me tonight too.
---
I have Radicool enabled, and the Marsupial mutation so I‚Äôm not sure which one is responsible for the Rad Worms bugging out my carry weight. 
---
I have a daughter too! Lol she‚Äôs going to be a year next month(: and it‚Äôs  Waallfloweerr 
---
Oh, WTF!  Here, take my upvote.
---
I‚Äôll add you tomorrow morning, (: thanks! 
---
What do you do with concrete?  Never found much of a use for it myself.
---
do you kids running that WS turret's bs... don't you feel like frikin duisturbing parasites? 
---
What platform are you on? PC updates are very small (~20 mb on average).
---
do you kids running that turret's bs... don't you feel like frikin duisturbing parasites? 
---
Na man, ther are enough glitches left for you. Have fun anyway.
---
I have 5. 140 38 10 8 and 3. The little 3 is Mueller :) I'm making him a mule/shopkeeper 
---
I have been freezing to the point of crashing lately
---
There isn't flat ground there. They mean turret bases by the golf CLUB (the building with all the ghouls in it) not the golf course. So much confusion.
---
Glad you enjoyed it.. soon this game will be completely dead and you can have a server all to yourself constantly!
---
I like it when someone puts a base there with no turrets. It stops a turret base spawning there and gives access to the stash and crafting benches.
---
Honestly it has been fun for me since Beta. Yes it has has it's issues but I always had fun, even if I died 20 times. I only play 2-4 hours a day, my days off I can get up to 6 hours of gameplay, rare occasions I get 8 or more hours.   I finally got my character from a couple days after launch to level 90 a couple days ago. I restarted so many times for two days and finally got smarter and better at the game. The first few characters I made ended up having no aid, ammo, or weapons broken or all 3. I figure, I can kill a creature get meat and get dirty water. The issue was enemies would kill me quickly since I had no ammo or weapons and couldn't restore my health. I just carelessly ran into different areas. I figure might as well start over than dying every 2 minutes.
---
I mean, I did say relatively. 
---
It‚Äôs a slope, but it‚Äôs consistent.
---
Very easy to put down foundations without the game complaining that a tiny patch of raised land is in the way, and there‚Äôs no long grass/ shrubs coming up through my floor.
---
Xbox one
---
Thank you
---
So is it "expecially" after the reviews or was it that you couldn't even manage to create a simple account ?
---
Yeah I always hear stories about people fighting over workshops.. I just leave, wait a few mins, hit Play again, and I usually wind up on a server with none of the workshops I want taken. Proceed to take 4 of em, then farm a few locations for a few hours while getting cores every so often.
---
I find it funny there are people that just scream your a automatic duper if you get this error code. From what I am reading its happening more to people who have digitally downloaded the game so might be a bug introduced from the last patch(shocker). I don't understand the automatic downvote of these posts nor the sudden shift from angry fans to Bethesda does no wrong in this sub but, reddit be redditing. 
---
There is but damage is lower with a higher critical. 
---
Lower durability of crafted items, worse selling/buying prices.
---
Digital downloaded the game or on disk?
---
oh well that's fair
---
sorry this is t-51b only, looks very cool tho :)
---
I guess this is why folks are saying they are playing on empty servers???
---
This bug with scrapping giving you fake BOS unlocks has been around for awhile. 
---
Back when you could still buy the BOS armor plans at Grafton I got ‚Äúunlocked BOS chest‚Äù from scrapping combat armor but couldn‚Äôt actually apply it.
---
It wasn‚Äôt until I purchased all the plans individually that I was able to get the BOS modification to work.
---
If anyone on Xbox is interested, I can help set you up with BOS armor while we wait for the plans to be available again.
---
I can do all limbs, chest, and the black BOS officer uniform up to shielded.
---
There are five .50 receivers for hunting rifle - "normal", Precise, Critical, Hasty and Refined. The highest damage is the latest, but it's still shy of 2 points than .308 Hardened.
---
Like the system out of Sunless Seas?
---
You'd get to keep either your map, a weapon or things like that, for the next guy to start with.
---
Yea found the note and being able to get extra stuff from doing a simple search is golden.
---
This guy gets it. Please loot everything from a body. Don‚Äôt just leave it there cause it‚Äôs junk, it‚Äôll help respawn rates as well. 
---
Theres a guaranteed spot near Miners Monument, just southwest of Whitesprings. its on the ground surrounded by bots.
---
I've got multiple freezes and crashes while i had non before.
---
I hope this gets fixed soon. Imo it's more annoying than not being able to loot!
---
Like the ones I kept seeing that we were going to get? Still wondering where that all went...
---
All the time. Also get message s from people who are low level who need help with the SB. 
---
What region are you ? 
---
Interesting information 
---
Isn't the entire point of this game to be played online with other players? Don't get me wrong some people can be dicks but if you wanted to play a Fallout game alone, Fallout 4 has the exact engine.   
---
I get private servers, have only your friends in with you but I don't get the want to play alone, personally. 
---
Love pharma farma and can do. Soo good. Need to up my scrounger perk too
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure I was able to do this but I needed to log in between. 
---
That has become pretty normal. People try it and dont understand the hate and anger. The ones hating the most usually have not even tried it.
---
You said a level 25 legendary. Are low level legendaries worth it?
---
Yes please,  to paint our PA would be amazing,  please let us do this,  big thumbs up üëç ‚ò∫
---
People here will tell you that means they're about to put them in the atom shop
---
Thats going in the list of things to do, thanks!
---
Im dealing with this right now, im on ps4 with disc. Ive turned off ps4 and still happening 
---
Stealth sniper, stealth melee assassin type, and I'm about to roll a no-stealth heavy guns/explosives. I think that covers all bases. :)
---
I won‚Äôt lie, I‚Äôve got a big grin on my face seeing you and your character all matchy matchy!
---
All the reasons the others gave, plus a huge increase in the chance that people will come up with creative ways to exploit something by being able to move and carry objects, means that Beth will probably never allow this.
---
they should just add private servers, like they said they were going to...
---
Ballpark on recipes for me please :) 
---
I‚Äôd love the .45 please mate!
---
Go with a melee build, right now guns are not very effective thanks to constant nerfing. A gun doing 300 damage per shot still takes 4-5 hits to kill a higher level mutant, or robot. While in melee its 1-2 hits and I don't even have the perk cards right for melee so if you stack all the slugger and other corresponding cards for melee you can one hit just about anything given a good melee like a stared death claw gauntlet or all rise. 
---
Yeah, I'd definitely like to appoint a spawn point.  It's always slightly annoying to appear back at my base with my back to it!
---
Yeah somewhat new player myself and have been wondering what the use of the extra stat points are, especially as i cant add extra cards when the points are on.
---
what does it take to get it? enlighten me
---
Strong statement. I agree and literally dealing with that login fail. Ive never duped and just trade...
---
Yeah, whoops just so used to having 9mm pistols in other games 
---
Ive had a legendary flamer for most of my play time and ive only ever had enough fuel to use it ONCE on a small mob of ghouls. 
---
Ah, I see that much like EA, you want to nerf things in this game to give other players a "sense of pride and accomplishment"(tm).  People are going to just adore you around here.
---
Currently they do not. Might just be the server.
---
six so far, because I deleted one.
---
the 5 that exist are levels: 65, 23, 11, 10, 8
---
the one I deleted to make room for the level 11 was level 53
---
The 'ol "please shoot this guy for me" trick.  Then 2 others with bazookas and power armor show up for the real night's entertainment.
---
just make offer.
---
They are on Reddit. I would direct you to them but I don't take part personally so I don't know their names.
---
Lol! I hate that they don't forget. Just last night, I was sneaking around Whitesprings with my level 36 character when a bunch of ~level 60 ghouls nearly cornered me (my fault). I ran back around the corner, luring them to the Protectrons and accidentally clipped a robot with some friendly fire. Oops. Amazing how the robots then completely forgot about the ghouls!
---
Are you dressing like your character, or is your character dressing like you?
---
Alot of posts on this already, some say its a ban temporary or perm. You can send a email or tweet they will send you a auto response telling you to check your internet, turn off your console or pc, re-download the game, stop playing the Beta. Some people just end up being able to log back in after a while, some can't.
---
If its a ban they should send you a email, and you wouldn't have access to other Fallout games associated with your email address or gamertag. Right now, it's a largely unanswered question people assume is a ban for acquiring to many rare items in a 30day period. 
---
Well, seems pretty impossible to find five god roll legendary affixes five times for the same armor.
---
Oh no. Give the stability issue and bugs we still have, I think that we're a VERY long way off from that sort of thing.
---
Not against the idea so long as Bethesda can hold up their end of the bargain.
---
OOF! ya i would have just walked away from the workshop after the first death. If i know its comin ill usually pop a psychobuff if theyre being a dick
---
It would be Sony and Microsoft, although Microsoft is game Sony is not. Also kinda hope that if it would ever happen they keep the consoles together and allow separation from PC. I see and hear of more cheaters in PC gaming then both consoles and that wouldn't be fun.
---
Huh. I noticed this too. I thought I screwed up the quest.
---
5 total
---
180~
---
140~
---
80~
---
25
---
5
---
This and also doesn't at all affect the number of perk cards you can slot it.
---
I never understood how the damage of the .50 cal variant is lower. Makes no sense.
---
Hahahaha
---
I really feel like 800 is decent number for stash size. It allows me to keep an abundance of junk and then the extra 200lbs can be for nice legendaries I want to keep. 
---
Would love to see a free weekend too! I think pretty much everyone is in agreement the first 60-100 hours is where this game shines. It would be great to see a bunch of freshies emerging from the vault to dump my spare plans on!
---
You weren't by yourself. I was there too. I was just sneaking the whole time, and avoiding you on the map.
---
I can't tell if this a shitpost or not
---
As others have said, it exists but there's no reason to go to .50. It's inferior or equivalent to the .308 with heavier and harder to get rounds.
---
Im level 50 and if someone has a Workshop i want, ill likely just hop server rather than the aggro of Pvp claiming it, even if its a low level.
---
It is supposed to work that way.   When you have one, it gives you random items and about 350 exp.  Two or more five you random items and 400 exp.  
---
When you get the quest, quantities are no longer displayed in your inventory and the hidden ‚Äúcount‚Äù of how many you have picked up resets to one if you change servers.  
---
Yeah, because it's a uniform. For religious people. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the those theme park worker outfits also count.
---
You got google?
---
I fought an Immortal Vampiric Bloodbug once outside of the Top of the World. It was regenerating after every shot. Even with my Gauss getting it down to a tiny bit of health, it. Would. Not. Die.
---
I never go to my camp. I need the rad scrubbers when i'm in a blast zone being mobbed by glowing ghouls. 
---
I think it has something to do with the apparel you are wearing underneath. I went from wearing my enclave officer and urban gas mask having no problems switched to the cult outfit and hit the same issue as you. Switched back and everything seems fine again. Not the best work around if you really care about what you wear beneath your PA but it seemed to work for me.
---
At the moment it's pointless.
---
If no one is around you, the enemies adjust to your level. All it takes is a high level to enter the area and all of them get adjusted to his level if all the enemies instantly respawn. It has happened to several people level 20-30 getting slaughtered when I enter the silo as a level 90. If they don't respawn, they remain low levels. 
---
Oof. Good luck. Hope you don't attract any creepers.
---
i got like 150 of it.
---
All my RL friends got bored and stopped playing, please add - Ozmizion
---
You can still just find a friend and share Rad Sponge, with rad scrubbers on your PA all those perks and the decontamination arch would be completely useless. 
---
Because they're designed that way.
---
I don't see a problem with this at all. You have the choice of going max damage but inefficient perk allocation or efficient perk allocation but lower max damage.
---
I appreciate the offer. I'm in no hurry. 
---
I'm pretty high level and still haven't launched a nuke. I spend a good deal of my time helping other players. In the day since that happened, I've already built up a pretty fair amount of scrap. 
---
I'll give that a try. It's the getting them to land part that's tough. Thanks buddy
---
Int also affects XP gains
---
Wow that's pretty good going. I just hit level 50 and can now use the sweet MIRV I picked up, so I'll give it a shot. 
---
I have 3 levels of lone wanderer and usually play solo. 
---
Those don‚Äôt affect the Perk Points.
---
In the ‚ÄòStat‚Äô tab on your pip-boy, you will find a page that states what value you have in each SPECIAL.
---
To the right, you should see a description of what each SPECIAL has an affect on. Mutations, diseases, and pretty much anything else that increases/decreases the SPECIAL will affect whatever is described there...you can pretty much take each paragraph literally. 
---
You should be able to view what each special stat does on your pip boy, the only thing not mentioned that I am aware of is that Intelligence increases your XP.
---
Any +/- you get from any source does not effect how many perks you can equip, that is completely determined by the investment you make when you gain a level.
---
Last night on PS4 a few of us from here went after the queen.
---
It was going well but then it potatoed; the queen stopped taking damage and would fly really far away, and there were frame drops and stuttering.
---
400 shotgun shells at 200+ damage each, and about 200 shots from my Two Shot Gauss Rifle, it was very disappointing.
---
C'mon bruh. That's just mean.
---
I paid $299AUD for the power armour version. Oh well ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Hi there! Below is a copy-paste of my response to the OP:

---
Newsboy cap and drifter outfit.
---
Yeah and I wanna paint my loose gears
---
How do you get the add ons/ blueprints for the excavator power armour? 
---
&gt; Learned my lesson! 
---
What lesson did you learn exactly?
---
Sounds like the game is dead.....
---
I tried leveling an alt without any legendaries and it really sucked after the strength of my main. With well rolled low level gun you can steam roll anything. 
---
If you mean the Excavator plans then it‚Äôs a mission reward for a mission in ash heap, for the mods it‚Äôs sold by the Camden vendor bot 
---
This happened yesterday to my husband and I, too. It was amazing. 
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/Bdp6nRY
---
I dunno, I see base building and working around the glitches (or working with them?) as the current endgame of FO76. I like to think I'm pretty darn good at it! 
---
I think the next few months will be telling as to whether or not this game will be viable long term, both in terms of bug fixes as well as new content.
---
So in other words, I should get some sort of marine armor that has radiation resistance because I put all my points into damage resistance anyway?
---
I know how to get the armour, but I meant the mods. I've literally not played for weeks and forgot their name haha. Thanks for the info though! Camden vendor bot here I come! 
---
True but now anything god tier people will claim is duped
---
+1
---
Shit game gladly its gonna be dead soon. Never gonna buy bethesda game again.
---
the reason I like marine armor more is because apparently, it offers radiation resistance where the other armors don't. If I'm already going into damage resistance, would make sense to get radiation resistance, right?
---
Next time you meet a flat-earther, you got one more reason to punch them. :)
---
Yeah.. but its far from the best power armour. "Everyone" as you say is in my opinion, a small group of sentimentally minded individuals who have become spoiled with choice.
---
But I don't blame you guys for at least asking, but would you be annoyed if future updates took longer because of all the finer detail requests that serve a minority?
---
I wish more people would realise this.
---
I'm pissed that I had about 15 data and got 30 10mm and 5 40mm grenades... Thanks man
---
I have an explosive, exterminator's hunting rifle. But it's actually worse than my instigating rifle even though it has higher damage, go figure. 
---
Ever since patch 5 my marsupial perk has been acting up.  I never use rad-x (the little rad resist is not worth losing my mutations for 10 minutes).
---
While i am playing my ability to jump higher will stop working, i can be on a server 20 minutes with no problem, then all of a sudden (not going in or out of buildings etc) it will stop working.  If i leave the server and join another it will function fine
---
This bug still exists? Haha
---
They probably figured out that VR support is an immense amount of work for fuck-all return. I wouldn't take any talk of VR support by anyone as a promise, nor waste any energy getting angry at them. 
---
60‚Ç¨ game and the bug is still not fixed
---
I use a instigating with +50% Limb damage with my stealth build. First Hit damage roundabout 800, with stealth roundabout 1700 
---
Same here, we have played about 12 hours over the weekend and no disconnects, no crashes and minimal lagging. This included our first nuke run and launch. It's been awesome. 
---
I only have a base on the golf course because everywhere is fucking hideous. I have about 4 turrets at my door and that's it, my doors are open to those who need but my purified water is locked away :3 damn thieves! 
---
What pvp? :D
---
I'd love to know the same.
---
Ace Combat came through. But yeah I feel you. We all get angry at games for different reasons. Boy people sure were steamed about FO76, ha
---
I agree with 90% of what you've said but would like to ask you if you would be willing to wait extra months for some raider PA paints that only a few people are going to use.
---
My point is, priorities.
---
Both iif mine are still level One as I'm only level 14 I got a late start to the game and have super busy soI haven't had allot of time to play yet. 
---
I also have Instigating+50% limb damage HR, but I was asking about numbers, not which one is better.
---
HAHAHA I miss that game.
---
People had done tests afterwards, especially with melee stacking. They didn't stack so all the scare over it was just fake news.
---
Might be some other exploit but I don't think it's that one.
---
Oh, are you one of those carrion players that leeches off other's kills?
---
I experienced this once and it seems to have been caused by an unstable mem overclock (on PC, dialing back to a stable mem OC resolved the problem). If not on pc it is probably a good idea to do a cold reboot (fully power down for a few min)
---
Nice. So basically if i had +2 AG i will just get better AP numbers/efficiency rather than using those extra points like i thought with cards. 
---
Which items are the "excess items"? The latest ones? Do they need to start tracking the order in which items are added to the stash? I'm sure that won't introduce any new bugs :)
---
Umm... stick to lower level areas until you're strong enough to handle it on your own?
---
Ebay is probably your best bet. Some people may auction off copies for cheap!
---
Atleast we got our helmets, and a decent looking steelcase
---
"WAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!! WAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!"
---
That's what you sound like. 
---
I actually *bought* (not Kickstarted) a DK1. I had time to process my anger. :)
---
If you send ticket to them, you will received an email that you got banned. Happened to a lot of people in other countries too. If you don‚Äôt send ticket, you receive nothing but account still not able to be login. 
---
I found the dragon at like level 20 which was level locked for about 20 levels, i used a black powder pistol and instantly sold both after realising the reload times lol.
---
Those are repeatable quests, much like the BoS one with technical data turn ins.
---
I‚Äôm not currently in-game and can‚Äôt remember what the AGI description is (examples: I remember STR affects carry weight, and INT affects the starting condition of crafted weapons &amp; armour), but yes, you‚Äôre now on the right track...not related to perk points at all. 
---
Some goals aren't instantaneous. It's grindy af but if you want it badly enough...
---
if your really don't want to i can do 1k each. 15k for all. 19 total
---
Tbh level 1 is fine for quite a while. I onl upped to three to make it even more regular. Generally get something extra in almost every container üòä Ahh im a little higher than that. Lol
---
Sorry I hadn‚Äôt replied yet, been dashing about like a madman this morning.
---
What times are you usually online??
---
Look, I get you're a dark souls fanboy, I bet if I mentioned the fact that harder games exist you would have an aneurysm, but try and be unbiased for a second.
---
 Your point was there was a great incentive to dark souls PvP, when there isn't in 1 and 3 (at the least) beyond souls and other things acquired through doing anything else. Fallout 76's incentive is caps and items, it's the same thing in a shittier game. Anecdotally, PvP was the fastest way to earn mats in 76 for me by a long shot.
---
I'm not gonna play dark souls again for it's tacked on pvp. I'm glad you enjoy it, but don't pretend it's the game everyone should be looking at for PvP.
---
There's also guns with the "Mutant's" prefix - more dmg. if you've mutated. I think they add 10% more. With all the right perks and a fully modded gun it adds up nicely.
---
on now.
---
Uh oh!! https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/jaggerslips13/screenshot/11507691
---
There is a reason why the saying "buyer beware" has its roots in Latin. 
---
Smart people purchased on Black Friday a couple weeks later at about half the price. Smarter people purchased much later than that, or if you're a real cynic, didn't purchase the game at all.
---
You might want to join the class action if you feel strongly enough about it.
---
i don't think a few def points are going to matter against all the % reduction. Thoughts?
---
Some of us enjoy the game. 
---
Just unlucky.
---
So. Much. This.
---
I would think that whatever Wild Appalachia hits that would possibly be a good point for free time.
---
I think it's a you thing. Non-event legendaries tend to want to rush me down.
---
Well, I don't like raider PA, I prefer a military style (t-51, t-45, t-60), but I am more looking to the Ultracite and the Excavator. This PA are particulary loved, and while they have cool colorways, expecially the Ultracite, I would like more painting possibilities. Everything step by step, week after week. I understand your point.
---
What times do you play?
---
The lvls in the silo just seem to be random, me and my wife do them all the time, me lvl 174 her lvl 100, and sometimes halfway through they will drop to lvl 20ish bots others will run through at all 50+ with random low, one of the runs we did today nothing above lvl 24. Never seams to be any rhyme or reason to the lvls of the bots, well nothing I can figure out in the 50+ runs I've done through there.
---
enjoy dupers, you was banned
---
Honestly, the idea itself was fine, and a full online mode isn't bad, but even if it would be a bit weird there should have been an offline mode. Hell, even if you couldn't move characters between the two modes to prevent cheating the option should have been there.
---
My bloodied melee build is overpowered and often encounters super mutants yelling "RUN AWAY!!!" and "RETREAT!!!", it's one of my fav parts of the game. If I change to a weapon that deals less damage they seem to be more willing to tangle with me. Ghouls run away too when I am looking at them from a safe location. Not sure if it is a bug or not.
---
Sorry if this is noobish, why wouldnt you use vats and TS? Im a pretty big vats user and have yet to make a dedicated build. 
---
It's really odd then, i also noticed this doesnt occur with every enemy  
---
Like Ghouls are agressive, and Radstags  
---
Super mutant and Scorched legendaries run away.  
---
I want display for my (almost complete) collection of Magazines.
---
No they all run from me too. Especially super mutants.
---
Run away. Run awayy.
---
Scorched could have been bcos they like to attack from range if they have range weapon. 
---
You should post this in whatever suggestions thread is going atm.
---
Bethesda has recently stated that they will be looking into ways to implement display cases, etc. (although I understand it will be months away) and I‚Äôm sure they would love to hear ideas like this one.
---
They not only run away but they yell run away
---
Likely has Adrenal Reaction mutation. Increases damage the lower your health. 
---
Is it because there are too many "worlds" and everybody ended up in the own personal world?

I haven't really found a wall to be necessary. I've been here for around a week and with one missile turret and one heavy machine gun turret it takes care of the job. Only had my machine gun turret broken once.
---
I just wish you could build in the middle of town - add additional buildings in between the ones that exist. I wanted to build a storefront in a vacant lot in a place like Pt. Pleasant or something, but you have to build outside of town.
---
I have like 60, so BRING IT, please! :p ;)
---
Or it could be some Oz shit. 
---
and what about that 3,5x sneak multiplier - am I right it's from mister sandman perk?
---
How would you stop people from stealing them?
---
Only under certain conditions. I bought one for me, and one for a friend, not knowing they were exploited. They came with extra durability, and 6 DMG resistance. Even though I have Fix it Good enabled, and can get the durability back when repaired, the damage resistance remains at 0 since the original degradation.
---
The first person who gets it!  This chamge isn't just increasing the total number of supposed-to-be rare plants in the gameworld it's also eliminating the need to "brave the wasteland" to acquire them and significantly reducing the time/distance traveled to acquire multuple rare plants.
---
This would be a major game balance shift towards making the game easier and it will never happen.
---
Yes, Mister Sandman &amp; Covert Operative perks

You can't get money back from the bar for having a hangover

I really wish there was a way to check which obtainable modifications we've already learned and which do exist in total. When modifying a piece of equipment there should be a complete list of all obtainable mods and all currently unavailable mods should be greyed out with a small (missing plan) next to it.
---
Referring to FO New Vegas as a good example once again: the Survival skill lets you cook food and other utility items at a campfire. Acessing a campfire shows all items PLUS their requirements (materials + skill level). So you know exactly, that you need at least 25 points in Survival to craft Gecko steaks.
---
Dont really see the point, if there was some kind of normalisation to the gear then id consider it, cant be bothered to PVP a level 250+ whose been grinding for top gear since beta.
---
I‚Äôm not sure about the guns, but as far as the thirst goes, do you have speed demon? 
---
I loved doing this in 4 but it made my gqme crash alot, i think they left that out of 76 due to server stability 
---
Did mine today. Wrecked one, he server hops, second, different, camp almost immediately spawned in allowing me to continue my spree of destruction. Good times
---
Biggest issue finding someone willing to shoot a 230 in the head. I was literally stood on white springs golf course roof for half an hour. Just in vault tech jumpsuit and a 260 bounty on my head...
---
Some nice person with a dragon spent five minutes carefully sneaking up to me to administer the kill shot, thank you kindly üëç

I guess mounting them onto a mannequin or trophy would render them as an individual piece of furniture that belongs to your CAMP. 
---
I'd love to trade caps or other legendaries for a 3-star TSE ;)
---
One.
---
Just a general display / collectors update then. Give us the chance to collect bobble heads too instead of making them disposable object!  
---
.50 is the easiest to craft, 100+ rounds each time with ammosmith. 
---
Sacrifice of 2 damage for the best cost/quantity ratio of ammo production.
---
Not seeing this issue, and I was doing nuke silo runs and SBQ fights with a prime .50 cal TSE, and 3 different flavors of gatling guns, all weekend long. Degradation rate seemed same as usual.
---
You also need to be a general in the enclave, otherwise you can't get in the silo
---
I can't help you I'm married ü§ó
---
Interesting. With the crown icon or does that even matter?
---
Just keep dropping technical data, it can take quite a while, did for me.

I'll definitely post it there. I just feel like this would be a very simple way to add a new lease of life to assets that pretty much already exist!
---
Check out the ‚ÄúPatch Notes‚Äù and ‚ÄúInside the Vault‚Äù articles on Bethesda‚Äôs websites. These articles have given us a heads up on patch size, you should be able to estimate an average from there (not that past average is a reliable indication on future patches). 
---
Major patches drop about twice a month so far, and there have been a few minor patches in between.

No, that's for marine shielded lining, not BoS.

You call me a fanboy because I said you‚Äô don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about, and then tell me to be unbiased. You‚Äôre a moron.

No, that wasn‚Äôt my point. You ignored my actual point like an idiot.

‚ÄúTacked on pvp‚Äù. Moron opinion.

I do not suffer fools. If all you have is BS, I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs a point in us continuing to speak. I can only hope nobody listens to you for pvp design advice, because you clearly just don‚Äôt get it.

Yeah. What a disaster. This is the kind of release that kills franchises. 
---
I hope it doesn‚Äôt.

I agree, and the more ideas the devs get, the better!
---
I think it's more like the system tries to put you in a populated server over unpopulated. If most everyone logs out of the server around the same time then it'll be low pop and people won't be put into those servers.

What do you mean work with? If you mean can they both be on the same weapon, yes. If you are asking if it works well on all enemies, it seems to. Some enemies, like the queen, are resistant to explosive damage but weak to anti armor so I'm not sure how it stacks there. 
---
As I said in the comments I fully understand that. It's just that it's literally glitched right now and i would prefer to not wait over 100 days of doing this "daily" to get it. Therefore I'm going to wait until a patch since their seems to be no other way cutrently.
---
No offence but if playing with someone on a game where you literally run around, collect items and shoot mutants is going to impact your marriage then idk what to tell you 
---
It's far more restrictive than it was in f4 though
---
I, too, long for the days of New Vegas.

Which bullets are you short on.? I have loads of spare shotgun shells, .38 and a few other ammo types if you are on PS4...

I freakin' hate ticks, the newbies can keep them lol.

Yesterday I met a legendary Wendigo who was really scared of me, but othewise I have not noticed this behavior before.
---
Yeah. I appreciate that they're changing the sonic boom soon, but I was hoping they'd add code for them to land more. 
---
At this point im not expecting anything from bethesda
---
Well I guess it's cause you used to suffer a huge accuracy penalty in vats when using two-shot but apparently it works now? Iuno I've heard people saying two-shot can actually hit in vats now so it could be good too.
---
They don‚Äôt stack after y the Bos quest line. Before you do you can carry multiple. It‚Äôs dumb. 
---
I get that you're super frustrated, but as other have said, if you want help troubleshooting this then specs would be helpful. And maybe add obvious things like whether you're using any mods or not.
---
It's really only the physical copies that are going dirt cheap at the moment (assuming due to over supply).
---
So yeah eBay unfortunately or wait until a summer sale in the store?
---
I‚Äôm not 100% sure but I think their AI tells them to run to other enemies to get the jump on you  (as they‚Äôre lucrative targets chances are you‚Äôll follow) or atleast this has been the case with me
---
I think I stole your drops.
---
Up until last week I hadn't gotten a single T51 armor plan from said events. Previous drops were T60 motion-assist servos and one odd assault rifle plan.
---
Last week I had two T51 armor plans rewarded; a torso and helmet. I'm still hoping to some day get the legs so that I can craft better ones before applying calibrated shocks to it.
---
I bet they have paints for it to release at some time. It's beyond me why they're waiting so long. 
---
it's sprinting. I've tested it personally 
---
It does happen! Especially as others have mentioned with super mutants who yell ‚Äúrun away, run awayyy‚Äù as they go!

A streamer I was watching the other day also said ‚Äúoh I forgot that legendaries run away from you‚Äù and she was just grinding not in an event. It doesn‚Äôt seem to be 100% but yeah, can happen :)
---
So hard to find 3 star legendary in fo76, but here every couple posts 3 star legendary troll üò≥.
---
U on xbox i can sell u all of them for 1k each. 15k for all. theres a total of 19 recipes
---
There are chems you can take that raise damage 25 percent, then bobbleheads, then magazines, then food/drink. There are lots of options to buff numbers. Not sure if they all display the damage numbers though..
---
Thanks!  This made this challenge a lot easier.  I checked a couple of others.  Asylum worker's uniform and amusement park uniform do not work for this challenge.
---
And nerfing weapons.
---
That's not how they worked in FO4, where we know they will pull the asset from.
---
I guess there could put an unpickable lock on them?
---
In any case there are still a lot of items from 4 that have yet to come over.
---
I dont think anyone hates the game more than they hate the ridiculous amount of bugs, glitches, crashes and disconnects.
---
After 250 hrs of this game I took a break and gave monster hunter a go. After about 30 hrs, I think I've encountered maybe one or two glitches. 
---
Of course these are different games but it is really nice to just play a game that fucking works. And I really think that they could've avoided all these issues if they just gave people what they wanted; fallout with 4 player co-op. I dont think anyone asked for this current format with tons of people on a single server at once. 
---
Level 50 and have no fucking clue how the PVP system works. I have pacifist on all the time as i cannot stand accidentally shooting people when farming. I know how the system iss *intended* to work (slap damage, mutual pvp) but once someone starts shooting me, i either die instantly (??) or i cant really figure out what the little [warning/reward] pop ups are trying to say (whos wanted? how many caps? Why is it never the cap reward stated? Sometimes it says they're wanted and theyre not even wanted on the map?)
---
Basically PVP its a mess and i simply sign out when people come destroy my base or shoot me because its easier. 
---
I think we get them after they feel like they are done with the game. The atom store doesn't make enough to run the servers. I know I'm not buying the game until this happens.
---
Same
---
It was never really that bad, the internet hate machine was fully engaged though.  Better now though, and pretty much done after a balance patch and one more stash extension.
---
Well at least you wont be disappointed
---
Oh ok thanks. Unrelated but while i have your attention, is there anyway to check the damage output of your build? Like a training dummy or somethign that shows your *actual* DMG , perks and all? 
---
Have you seen the clip? I know you can get bobbles, chems, mags etc to max your stats, but on that clip he just changed his perk cards.
---
Tomorrow? 
---
you can, open spotify in the background, adjust the music volume to mix well with the footsteps and sound effects in the game, and put on a bluegrass playlist.
---
And most of us don't. They changed the entire recipe for a game that was huge.
---
I heard AAE doesn‚Äôt work with the E part. Rumors regarding this bug. I want yo know for sure. It completely ignores AA in this combo. Is it true?
---
Erg... Happening again today, also seeing duplicates of outfits in inventory, so idk
---
Just power lvl your character to 50 and then do the quests, Bethesda design this game in the way that there is no room for low lvls outside of forest area.
---
Diablo 2 did this, and it was like 20 years ago...
---
...
---
...20 years ago ??? god fucking damnit, time flies...
---
you can also stream anything you want from onedrive in xbox. Find good mixcloud content, rip it down and place it in one drive, use groove music app on xbox to play in game in background. I have 12 plus hrs of rare music djed with not 1 commercial.
---
how much for each?
---
The mechanic is nearly there with power armor. When you exit the chassis, it belongs to you. It's also on display whilst you're repairing / modifying so I guess when you're in your camp they could withdraw the return to inventory system and apply this for multiple sets. Luckily in fo4 there were no other players to worry about so pop the fusion core out and your suits were safe! 
---
I reached 255 of them. Then the game literally prevents you from carrying more üòê
---
Thanks for the reply, that's unfortunate but I'll keep on the lookout. Thanks.
---
That I do not know...we dont see damage numbers per hit so it seems a bit hard to tell. Sure seems like it does not ignore the AA though. I think that is my suspicion with the queen, that the AA is canceled by the E due to her resistances and weaknesses. Basically making it straight damage. 
---
I'll start looking, thanks for the reply!
---
I have completed plenty of Distant Thunder events that did not yield PA plans at all pre-patch.
---
This is not new, not really. 
---
It's doing that to all/almost all headlights.. my t60 bright light is doing as well. I've seen people complain that their colored lights are doing it, and in some cases, the red lights are turning into a mothman version by themselves. 
---
No problem! Good luck with your search!
---
And common enemies like super mutants.
---
No, it definitely hits those hard. I 2 shot lvl 68 ones all the time with AAE. 
---
Pretty sure it was only for PC players.
---
If you want to PVP you're endgame armour is going to be Cavalier or sentinal with assassins on it. so each piece will give -8% and -15% damage reduction. Don't worry 2 much about marine or combat or leather it doesn't matter what piece as long as it has these stats.
---
If you want endgame PVE then unyielding or vanguards will do just fine.
---
As far as weapons go melee is just easier  you dont need the perfect gun to do endgame dmg. Otherwise you will spend forever looking for the perfect gun to be able to come close to melee dmg. 
---
Pacifist mode doesn't stop damage to camps anyway...
---
Great! Thanks for the info my friend :)
---
IIRC before the game was released they said private servers wouldnt be coming until about a year after release.
---
i sent you a chat.
---
I'd like to know also. 
---
Update: seems to have been caused by applying a gpu oc in msi afterburner, returning to defaults settings has resolved the issue (cold reboot too)
---
You're welcome. See the queen has a super high explosive resistance. Her weakness is AA. Super mutants are weak to AA but they also dont like explosive either. 
---
Make a new character and use them as a carrier.
---
If you have a friend you play with, I‚Äôd suggest you drop your items in your friend‚Äôs camp and drop as much as you can in one of those paper bags (as long as you don‚Äôt need it). Spare materials, weapons, etc. 
---
Make a new character to be your mule, join your friend once more with this new character and pick up the stuff you dropped. Either hold all of these items on the character, or stash them. Leave the server and rejoin as your main character and play as normal.
---
I‚Äôve only recently started using a mule character to hold all of the items I don‚Äôt want to lose but find too heavy to carry. (I still place plans/items for plates in suitcases around the map if I know I don‚Äôt need them anymore). 
---
They‚Äôre out now, only available for PC but  you can still get them if you got a console copy of 76. Just download the Bethesda launcher and log into your Bethesda account to get them. 
---
Lol "dead soon"
---
I didn't even know they *could* give plans, must have done 10 bos events...
---
Remember to get out from your pa to use stealth boy
---
They are free for anyone who played in 2018, whether it was PC, XBox or PS4. They are only available for download on PC, install the bethesda launcher and use the same account you used for FO76 and they will available for free.
---
In my experience bulking isn‚Äôt always too helpful. I had no space in my stash and decided to bulk everything and still had little space left. Bulking necessary items is a bit more helpful (aluminium, lead etc). If you have loads of an item that you get regularly, like steel, then just bulk that and sell a bunch. You‚Äôre not really going to miss stuff like steel too much
---
And get rid of pvp
---
I think what that guy did was awesome and is a true raider nothing wrong with that..sadly the quit out option should be taken out..he laid the trap you fell for it your char should have died..quitting out just breaks the fun of the game..
---
If the raider reads this good job and build!
---
This should have all the info you need:  https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/72mS8mnzJ6UgSMo0GQIaQy/pre-order-fallout-76-on-pc-and-receive-the-fallout-classic-collection-for
---
I was for the most referring to those that have not even tried the game.
---
sent you a chat.
---
I drop stuff in the first aid kit outside flatwoods church 
---
Nice. Good info. I kept hearing about this bug with AAE not having a working AA part. Now I know it‚Äôs not true :)
---
I must have seen about 5 different teams all calling themselves the enclave... This is gonna get confusing
---
Who exactly? I don't see anyone saying that...
---
But for like the billionth time, this isn't Fallout 5.
---
Maybe it is, maybe I just dont notice it. It just doesnt seem to be for me  
---
It was a joke referencing the drama over the bug with PA headlamps being "in the atom shop" even though they weren't
---
See and this is kinda sad, when people would rather play your multiplayer game solo, then with others.
---
I've gotta say, I *seriously* doubt this was caused by any OCs, since this bug is server-side as well as clientside
---
And for the billionth time they should have gave it a name that wasn't Fallout. By the way they advertised before it came out it is Fallout 5. Just because they say Fallout 76 instead of 5 means nothing.
---
Well I've found a use for the artillery finally. Wouldn't it work to shoot once and have the turrets kill you, or do they not get aggro'd by that?
---
Good to know, was pretty annoued that i was expected to scrap a fairly rare item
---
Faschnact masks are totally obtainable. I have one! There's one in the bank vault.
---
I know they are but there are and should be more available past the usual ‚Äúfashnact man mask‚Äù
---
Building material. You use it to make brick walls, and concrete floors. Looks better than wood.
---
Thanks!
---
I‚Äôve never had a workshop attacked by players, but then again I only claim a workshop as part of an event or mission. Only had 1 person attack my camp because he was griefing, wasn‚Äôt too much of a problem because he left after me and my partner killed him a few times.
---
If a workshop is claimed by someone else and they‚Äôre nearby, try to see if you can use a headset and talk to them and see if you can claim it, get what you need for an event and leave.
---
You‚Äôre better off finding friends to travel with/join a team to gain materials and experience. I‚Äôve never utilised a workshop for a long period of time, and I still have a lot of items that I‚Äôve personally collected by travelling around the map with other players. In my experience, this is one of the easiest ways to bulk up on materials and raise your level. 
---
Okay :)
---
you may be right, but there is an easy test: turn off your OC (return to default settings) and see if the problem is still there. 
---
good luck!
---
That makes a lot of sense to me. 
---
It's great when you can nuke whitesprings and have most of the kills yourselves instead of players flocking like flies to shit lol
---
dayum..sentinel it is then
---
Apparently it was removed some time ago because people were doing things like placing the welcome mat at the edge of a cliff so people fast-traveling would fall to their deaths, where the owner of the camp could loot their junk. 
---
How about adding a few paint shops in random locations, so we could customise our own paint jobs. IE :  every part a different color. ( not my personal choice).
---
Thanks for the offers everyone but im on xbox1, gamertag dmbabs308
---
And as someone with a base on Hole 2 by the giant snake on the map, DON'T destroy mine.  I'm just here for the ambiance and pretty green lawn.  And the water.  And the two legendaries that spawn nearby.  And the yao guai.  And the central location.  Not your kills.
---
I think OP is having issue regarding login. You guys seems like banned him accidentally. 
---
Just help you to voice your concern to Bethesda people here. 
---
Your sheet actually does show most effects, I mean the damage that shows when you equip the weapon. You have to equip it for certain things to show. Perks that don't are like tenderizer which actually applies a debuff to the enemy instead of buff to your damage directly. Then  you just multiply by your sneak attack modifier and calculate your crit damage, I think there's a page on the falllout 76 wiki that explains the crit damage part. And I think that's it *scratches head* 
---
PS4 players could for a little while get it for that price in Poland. Not  like its some kind of standard,lol!
---
I thought line is the sand was only good for purified water and fusion cores lol.. I never knew BOS stuff gave plans
---
"Luca, day after day you've profitted off the scarcity and necessity of others. At times leaving them with nothing but scraps. It is time for you to find your way out of your own greed.". S*aw theme intensifies*
---
Ah yeah now I remember having to pull the cores out or settlers would help themselves if there was an attack!
---
Seems like an easy thing to add, it is a shame but I do think we are gonna get drip fed a lot of stuff that is essentially already made.
---
Thank you very much for the reply, so its better to just do a melee build? How about power armor? Is it necessary?
---
At Whitesprings, if you can hide/crouch in the vicinity of the robots so that the status bar goes from [Caution] to [Hidden], they will forget they are mad at you. :) I usually just hide on the roof if I accidentally hit one!
---
Sniper barrels don't modify the damage enough to make them useful, same deal with laser sniper barrels.
---
8. All of them are for mr fuzzy tokens and all but 1 are junk that I use every once in awhile for team challenges.  I have 2 xbox's
---
Theyd be worth stealing from then to get the bounty
---
The lights really get me, I paid 9k for the letters and can barely spell a word without using my entire budget
---
Quest item and cant be dropped
---
That's what I was saying, my explosive has a higher damage number than my lower value rifle, but it's not as good. 
---
I think they may have done their balancing math  against 0dr or something and that's why high ROF weapons have such low damage, looks good on paper, doesn't work in practice.
---
I've been encountering scared legendary scorched, super mutants, and to top it off, two legendary level 92ish Deathclaws. I had to chase those damn things for miles, until I could finally land the killing blows. They run for a bit, then stop to hide behind something.. then run again when you hit them or get too close. A full health legendary should not run
---
The bug where random pieces (a leg or arm or two) do not equip can show up no matter what I do.
---
esp. when ur in a rush lol
---
whats good abotu sugar grove?
---
I thought about that right after i posted. Lol personally i just do one at a time.  Just build a fusion generator and it seems to make a fusion core about every 4-5 minutes though i haven't timed it. 
---
How close can you get and still have it work?
---
My camp is at that little pond/water hazard that's like a minute walk south and I loved to fire off a few batteries 
---
Completely agree with all points, it's a really frustrating feature and doesn't even make sense half the time with it's mental build order. It needs looking at.
---
Any idea where we can find the paramedic and police officer's? I had to use those and would like to get them back!
---
Slots and roulette would be nice way to make caps in fo76. 
---
r/FO76Bazaar
---
So what‚Äôs the deal with this....lots people getting it and no banned email....so must be a bug.
---
&gt;You call me a fanboy because I said you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about, and then tell me to be unbiased. You‚Äôre a moron.
---
Do you know what those words mean man? You, a fanboy, are biased. That is how bias works. 
---
&gt;No, that wasn‚Äôt my point. You ignored my actual point like an idiot.
---
What was your point then? It seems like it was, summed up, "dark souls pvp is more rewarding". I pointed out evidence they were essentially the same, you started crying and hurling insults. These are M rated games, but you are quite immature. Heh.
---
&gt;‚ÄúTacked on pvp‚Äù. Moron opinion.
---
Wonderful argument, you sure do have a way with words.
---
&gt;I do not suffer fools. If all you have is BS like this, I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs a point in us continuing to speak. I can only hope nobody listens to you for pvp design advice, because you clearly just don‚Äôt get it.
---
&gt;I do not suffer fools.
---
wait what
---
You've been trolling this entire time, right? Please?
---
True... Everyone running around shacking a bag at each other. :D 
---
PC.  I also have it on PS4 and that works fine.
---
Probably the radworm bug.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/amermo/bethesda\_bug\_rad\_worms/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/amermo/bethesda_bug_rad_worms/)
---
You will jump a little higher while you have the radworms. Once cured you may lose marsupial until you log into a new server.
---
Where are you seeing 3333 ammo per day?
---
I see 22,518 nuke-grapes and a quarter million Ultracite rounds.  
---
I was going to say I have way more than 36k of fusion cells. But I got that over 400hr of playing. 
---
My group always destroys them and every owner shows up wondering why. They die too... usually multiple times. No one cares about the wanted because everyone else is happy to see them go up in flames.
---
There actually is a Breaking Bad/Walter White easter egg already in the game. I forget where, but there's a spot with a massive hole in the ground full of pre-war money, and there's a skeleton laying beside it with glasses and a gas mask.
---
Just after you enter Asylum (where BoS HQ is) get into on of two rooms (it's on the table). At least I've found them there yesterday (looks good with my Asylum Worker Outfit Green ;)
---
Thank you very much 
---
i sure as heck hope this is not true. as a big guns build i chew through ammo like a deathclaw through a level 2 vault dweller
---
They listed also normal ammo like shotgun shell and .45 round. People geting emails that they aquire over 100k items so the autoban system trigger. 100k / 30 days = 3333 ammo per day.
---
&gt;or the artillery finally. Wouldn't it work to shoot once and have the turrets kill you, or do they not get aggro'd by that?
---
ohhh clever boy!!! I'm so gonna do that!
---
Start a new game and transfer it into the account
---
She lands more now so good group of players can DPS her quickly . Not to mention most SBQ fights are fought right outside the nuke zone.
---
Ohh clver boy. I'm so doing that today!
---
You could do that before the last patch, but not anymore, a friend and myself did it one day, taking turns holding the extras, you could only submit 2 per server, then Hop &amp; submit 2 more.
---
After submitting 2 on a server, picking them up would allow them to stack in inventory, now even after 9 (them most I've done on one server, it still triggers the quest, so anymore you pick up will merge with the active one.
---
You may still be able to have a character that has not started or completed the BOS quest line pick up multiple and then drop them for you one at a time.
---
Happens to me almost once a week which is annoying because i can't access my camp without marsupial lol
---
It‚Äôs the same BS fear monger if from people claiming they were getting banned for crafting / scrapping to learn mods.  
---
We should be able to grow fauna? Welcome to my deathclaw farm. Keep limbs inside vehicle at all times
---
Disc or digital
---
Ive been trolling as long as you‚Äôve been presenting poorly thought out opinions. So, yeah, basically this entire time.
---
Sorry that being insulted hurt your feelings. If you‚Äôre still butthurt, feel free to cry pointlessly some more about it. Or, you know, you could fuck right off as well. Both are solid options. I already told you what I think you should do several messages back. But a conversation? I genuinely don‚Äôt have enough patience for you bud. 
---
And it's so small wonder I spend all my valuable mats to make nuke mines for this reason alone. (PLUS Wrecking Ball perk is very nice)
---
I dropped around 18 on Saturday, and there seems to be a pattern where I get caps, Stimpaks, ammo on every drop, but also get a BOS outfit every 5th drop, I used to get plans, but haven't received any since the last patch.
---
Is a deathclaw huge?
---
i mean it dead already sry
---
I just met a dude last week who does shocks and serums for cheap if you have the materials... if not he can still do it but the cost goes up alot if you dont have the flux.
---
Yes. I understand. I am talking about the mods for legs and the mods for torso. I have the mod for bos arms. 
---
I really hope that 76 is a big teaser for Fallout 5. 
---
Set in the same map but years before when all these factions were still alive and well. Their outcomes in 76 are the bad endings. 
---
I take water from anyone who parks at Charleston train station, I consider that as taking the high ground rather than flattening their base.  Was looking for that damn vendor bot and the number of times I saw camps there instead.....
---
Yeah it's got a low playerbase but Bethesda wouldn't shut down a game making money. People complain about the atom shop but they still use it. It's the same as it was with ESO, they won't shut it down or care about negative reviews as long as that crown store is making b a n k
---
Abandoned waste dump for death laws. Nice places to hide there. Tangrea town I think it's called for sloths. Super mutant behemoth solomons pond. Lower levels will have to run a bunch to kill it. 
---
The list shows deathclaws so I assume so.
---
&gt; they will pull the asset from.
---
Skyrim had Mannequins 
---
DeWalt PA is perfect.
---
That would be cool. Honestly I wish 76 has been a joke, or something and not a full stand alone. At this rate it'll be years before we get anything from Bathesda, and in that time we'll have either the fiasco that is 76, or already years old Bathesda games, if we stay to begin with. That doesn't bode well for future sales.
---
Disk
---
Its annoying having to quit out and back in. Itll happen at least once a day for me. 
---
I knew that 1 and 2 were only for PC just wasn't sure on how to obtain the games. I've just downloaded the launcher. 
---
How do I transfer things between my characters?
---
No I'm mutation free. And have no perks that affect thirst.
---
You'll probably be disappointed as the PvP is unbalanced af and PvE is er lacking.
---
Yeah I still play every day but it's got enough PvE for me. If you want PvP stay away lol.
---
We will try this thank you.
---
If you love pvp, I recommend you stay far far away from this game. 
---
I grow blackberries they are not vegetables.
---
From these 2 bethesda reaplies its clear for me that ammo trigger flagsystem. They should not put ammo in that system calculation.
---
Will you be on in an hour?
---
Just dont return fire. Ive only been killed on low lvl alt in blast zone after radition bug accured. Had low health and about 5 guys was blasting me with their explosive weapons lol.
---
If ur on xbox I can give you my spare pair. I loved them in f4 so had to get them when I saw them 
---
Sense your on xbox if you need help I can help if needed. Or at least be a stand by in case you need help. The sloths won't always spawn there but I see them alot there. 
---
Thats perfect man thank you. 
---
It says 100,000 RARE in game items in their response.  I doubt regular ammo counts as being rare. 
---
My brother has the same experience as you. His heavies seem unchanged, but since the last update (not hotfix) all my heavies degrade super fast compared to before that update. 
---
What platform?  I probably have half a dozen pairs. (PS4)
---
Then... Use the decontamination arch? Or there was also a perk that heals your rads during the day, that could also be useful.
---
Rad scrubbers on PA would quite literally make all those perks and the decontamination arch useless, they won't be adding them anytime soon. 
---
I‚Äôm on PC. 
---
I think it's more likely you misunderstood the PvP mechanics or were mistaken about having Pacifist mode on, considering a player actually recording themselves with over 200k damage due to explosive bobbleheads stacking still was only doing slap damage (see here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw4xomXVwpQ).
---
While I've seen people on here making similar comments to you I've never seen a shred of evidence.
---
For sure!
---
I have 4 characters and my power armour heavy weapons build is not only the most fun but absolutely wrecks and is almost impossible to kill. It's really worth the effort, I turn up to scorchbeast fights with around 12 heavy guns and just let rip.
---
I'm totally sure it was the 20,000 .45's
---
Not the 250,000 Ultracite ammo.  25,000 Nuka-Grapes.  And 700 Stealth Boy MKIIIs.  That the user acquired in less than 30 days.
---
I‚Äôm on PC. Appreciate the offer though!
---
I also thought like that, but there is normal ammo listed in bethesda response so its look like they count it.
---
Console players as well were eligible, you just need a Bethesda.net account 
---
There are several objects that will teleport to the floor above, I think thats getting fixed next patch, but im sure they wont fix all of them. Drives me nucking futs!
---
Theres other objects that cant be placed on the upper floors- pressure plates and decontamination showers for example. 
---
Theres a lot of things that you have to build in a certain order or way to get them to place, essentially "breaking" it to make it work properly.
---
That would be nice. Message me if you can, we don't have mics but we can follow you around. My GT is Luca Explo.
---
Aw okiedoke.
---
Baronik is right though I picked up a pair in the Bos asylum just yesterday too. 
---
What time are you guys on. 
---
V-day event says til 18th. Live stream event stated 22nd. Could be very soon
---
I'd love this
---
Stop playing...
---
Whitesprings, Events, Nukes and Challenges.
---
We need an option to turn junk items into ornaments. I have shelves in my camp and the only thing i can place on them is my C.A.M.P.
---
If you go to recent players you can press fast travel on anyone in the server and it will come up with how many caps it would be, giving you an idea of where they could be. If there's no fast travel option, then they are no longer in your server. Or that's what I've found when I have thought I was in an empty server. 
---
Haven‚Äôt made it there yet, but I might trek out there tonight to see if I can find a pair. 
---
I bought 3 and never used them, I‚Äôll sell you all 3 for 400?
---
We should be on in half an hour and a long time after that lol.
---
It's not "enable" as in "tick the 'allow crossplay' box". It's a whole fuckton of work and new and interesting bugs if and when they decide to support this. 
---
lvl up more
---
The grafton monster by Charleston station counts. I believe he‚Äôs lvl 10. 
---
\^\^\^\^  there IS the troll
---
I find it a lot better than the old shows.
---
There are ways to get your pvp "fix" in 76.  The main way is workshop hunting.  Check to see which workshops are owned, those are the people who have agreed to pvp.  Whether they realize it or not...
---
It's common item, so I didn't even bother to search for it. This one location I remember since I've just acquired that outfit and found it looks better than Patrolman sunglasses I've been using earlier.
---
Its look like all they listed is counting. Why post abount normal ammo - for sure they get full list from antyban system, if its listed - it was propably counted. Thats why i created topic - normal ammo on that list just not fit.
---
I make 5-7k 5.56 ammo every day to split between mine and my wife's toons, been doing this for more than a month without a flag. 
---
If you look through this thread you‚Äôll see screenshots of people who have posted ticket responses they‚Äôve gotten back
---
I'll stay up till then. Just a forewarning I'll be drunk. Just got off of work. Gt AdoredGosling0

Apparel vendor shop in Whitespring. On the counter next a small "sale" sign.
---
Can't wait.  I think we get extra stash space with the next patch.
---
Its not impossible, its better in a group for sure. You just have to stay in the area your level and gear are for. If you are level 23 going to Whitesprings for example is not going to be the area for your level and gear. 
---
Most of us had to grind through this, you will have to as well. The game isn't meant to be on easy mode just cause you want to rank. There will also be times when you could be on the server alone and still run into a higher level creature. Again the game is more geared toward groups and sometimes you have to fight tooth and nail for things.

Don't forget deathclaw island and grafton day event.

I think the sweetest trolling would be to have a "Safe Control" entry in a terminal, but no safe anywhere. :)
---
&gt;Ive been trolling as long as you‚Äôve been presenting poorly thought out opinions. So, yeah, basically this entire time.
---
My opinion that I backed up with evidence is wrong because you disagree and throw tantrums. Okay then.
---
&gt;Sorry that being insulted hurt your feelings. If you‚Äôre still butthurt, feel free to cry pointlessly some more about it. Or, you know, you could fuck right off as well. Both are solid options. I already told you what I think you should do several messages back. But a conversation? I genuinely don‚Äôt have enough patience for you anymore bud.
---
Yes I'm the one exerting a ridiculous amount of emotion right now. You got me. ;)
---
&gt;Edit: A bit silly of you to make fun of my diction with a name like yours. Perhaps you should consider changing it to something more basic. It‚Äôs very misleading. 
---
For someone so intellectual I would have thought things wouldn't go over your head so  easily...
---
Np dude lol. I'll message ya in a bit.
---
It's because you are a duper hoarding a bunch of rare items.  You don't have anything to worry about thru normal gameplay.
---
It's the exact same thing as the people claiming 3 weeks or so ago that they were being banned for crafting / scrapping lots of armor to try to learn mods.  It's being pushed by cheaters being banned to take advantage of the existing negative view of the game and sow more distrust with the system.
---
Not sure how you consider it, but I really like it when there's a level 91 Deathclaw (better loot than the Honey beast or Grafton Monster, &amp; easier to kill than the Damn teleporting Rad scorpions), I got 3 of them on one trip to WS yesterday, and killed them all with an Instigating DC Gauntlet.
---
Thats the only one we've managed to kill so far.
---
If not why not? I use 9 slugger, 3 martial artist and 3 incisor.
---
FYI tagging more than 3 users stops them from being pinged.
---
It's not just radworms, had it happen with a multitude of disease's. Out of everything wrong with this game, this bug is the worst
---
Why not take a break until then? I'm probably going to roll another alt, but if that doesn't stick, I may finish a single-player game or two in the meantime.

I've done a few base builds for my youtube but kinda lost inspiration for the game since they drastically reduced the life of power cores, made my excavator power armour useless despite being camped out near a power armour spawn point, 9 times out of ten there's no core in it, no idea what sort of Fallout videos people would like to see now, obviously no exploits of glitches as Bethesda is apparently banning those youtubers, I have lost the love for the game since Crackdown 3 came out........ 
---
Ya but it would also have been a no-brainer for Excav to have a Bright Headlamp mod lol
---
Mine started working normally again a couple days ago. I didn't change anything, so I'm not sure what was wrong or how it got fixed.
---
The blue suitcase at Watoga Station is the only consistent almost official spot I know of.
---
I dump it near the Enclave vendor (one inside military wing, one that sales X-01 mods) - sometimes in the metal box opposite of vendor, sometimes, when items are more "valuable" and want anyone to see it, just in the middle of the room to paper bag.
---
I always turn in 2 at a time (higher exp reward, whether or not drop chances increase would be purely anecdotal, but I have multiple paints and multiple 1* Legendary Heavy Combat Armor pieces.) but mainly because I don't farm it.  And there are _so much_ Technical Data in the Enclave Bunker's Military Wing, it's not like I'm hurting to find it.
---
I've had a few infinite load screens when first starting the game and joining a world (one on Saturday, and one right now, hence why I'm on reddit), and I've had pretty poor framerate while playing over the weekend. Only had one server disconnect though. 
---
deleting because this is no longer relevant.
---
I wrote this while everyone was under the impression that Bethesda was removing any items that may have been duped, including those that were purchased by legitimate players from dupers.
---
this post was a defense of that happening, had it gone down that way. I argued that while it is a shame for some to lose caps over the decision, the action of removing illegitimate items is necessary in order to preserve the integrity of the game, and allow for a more fair playing field for new content going forward, as well as for new players finding themselves in a sea of OP players that bought their way.
---
alas, Bethesda did the safe thing and only went after the main offenders. While i was hoping for a serious crackdown, what was done was appreciated. apparently those that had crazy amounts of rare items were targeted, as well as those with 100k+ of other items from duplication. those that purchased weapons were safe, and even the offenders got to keep 1 of each item in the stacks that were reduced (not fair imo, but it was the safe option).
---
anyway, bc of how it went down, this post is no longer relevant. Im sure nobody will see this comment, but if you do, thanks for reading, and thanks to the anonymous strangers for the silver and gold.
---
fingers crossed that this marks a more serious stance towards cheaters, and a path towards focus on content and real issues.
---
I found a bloodied meat hook....
---
I did a White Springs Nuke run today and you would think that's where I would find it...  nope....   I was gathering wood to make supper and ran across a 3\* wolf attacking a Super Mutant...  I found it stuck in the wolf's side after I killed him.
---
It's a Bloodied Meat Hook, Reflects 50% melee damage back when blocking, and Take 15% less damage while blocking.  I've upgraded it to Extra hooks.  
---
I did get a 1\* Anti-Armour Meat Hook from White Springs.  It Ignores 50% of your target's armour.  I also added the Extra Hooks to it.
---
Let me know if you're interested in them...
---
You forgot to mention on what system your playing.
---
I think that was probably the spot I found. Good to know! I got way too much ammo I have no plans on using anytime soon.
---
This usually happens when servers are down for maintenance.  
---
Flatwoods' Overseer's Cache.  Pretty much all my excess ammo goes there.  Along with all boiled/dirty water, most canned goods (except my Dog Food, bow-wow).  Excess plans that I don't feel are worth the effort to try to trade (almost all CAMP items these days, and most low level armor and mods).
---
Very interesting, i got the same rifle with almost same perks and it give me only 190 with the rifleman perks maxed out, gonna try to maxou the bloody mess and explisive ones to see.
---
Because I'm also using a damage resist build. It's non power armor. But someone told me it was inefficient because the first perk Point costs 10% and the second one 5% so it's diminished in use
---
But don't the paper bags disappear if someone isn't within a certain number of hexes of them after a while?
---
But the servers aren‚Äôt down for maintenance...
---
Pmsl, that's different 
---
I've heard that the banhammer has been applied without notification recently. The only way people are finding out is by raising tickets.
---
Take over workshops, sell bulks to vendors, rinse, repeat. I try to do the quests where you can get legendaries. 
---
Not just you. For the last three months I never understood why people complained about crashed / disconnects. Then, when everyone else kept posting how smootly the game runs, I finally got my share. Had more crashes and disconnects this weekend then ever before. 
---
I‚Äôm not a BETA player. I didn‚Äôt play until release day. I have a disc copy of the game. 
---
Almost as if they just made a real fallout game 
---
Ugh, that‚Äôs what I wax afraid of. 
---
I didn't use PA for a long time for this reason. I waited until I could power a fusion core processor. 
---
Don't know - I've been founding many useful papers bags and there wasn't anyone in the area, so maybe it won't? If you're right I'll be leaving stuff in containers.
---
I agree, but to be honest I'd frag your base if I came across it behind the golfclub if it had turrets. No turrets no problem but turrets, means I don't mind a bounty.
---
how do you even raise a ticket? surely this is a mistake on their part, ive never done anything to warrant a ban!!
---
if anyone knows how to help id appreciate it
---
I think what the OP is posting about is in regards to bases with turrets shooting the creatures in the golf club. 
---
I frequently have to chase down Legendary enemies that flee, I think it has something to do with Stealth/Sneak attacks, if they can't find you, they "Run!, Run Away!"
---
Hell ya! How was there not a Raider paint in the Heavy Metal themed atom store release a while back?
---

Just a tip; copy your text field before submitting the ticket. Sometimes it goes to an infinite loading screen and you have to restart and re-type.
---
You can only carry one..?
---
‚ÄúHurr durr, like, ya kill guys and get stuff. It‚Äôs exactly the same!‚Äù
---
Sorry, not interested.
---
&gt; Yes I'm the one exerting a ridiculous amount of emotion right now. You got me. ;)
---
See, that‚Äôs the funny thing about the internet. It‚Äôs really easy to pretend you‚Äôre something you‚Äôre not. But the truth is... the best case scenario for why you‚Äôre sitting here defending yourself and listening to me call you a fucking dumbass, for trying to say F76 pvp = Souls pvp lol... is that you‚Äôre butthurt.
---
We‚Äôve already established that I‚Äôm trolling. Are you trolling too? Because if so, you‚Äôre pretty shit at it.
---
That‚Äôs a great idea. 
---
If it were an indicator for a dying game and not a just a relatively common bug since day 1 I would agree
---
Yep same here on my 2H melee build. I've seen some people argue for including some blocker in there and reducing all of the sluggers by one. It's all down to personal preference really but I think I'd rather have more damage :-)
---
If you are going for a non power armour build you might want to consider going with unarmed stuff like power fists and death claw gauntlets with the iron fist perk. The bloodied builds with these are very high damage.
---
Fear mongering. It would be extremely difficult and non sensical for me to play in such a way to legitimately make that much shotgun ammo. To say nothing of the entire stockpile they list. Plus as you claim a crafting character could hit that I say no cause a crafting character would trade that stuff away.
---
You need to evaluate the amount of items shown as a whole and not individual counts. 
---
Finally, cheaters always lie. Every time somebody actually posts to complain about being banned, it always is obvious they‚Äôre lying about something. ‚ÄúOh I was only doing XYZ I wasn‚Äôt cheating!‚Äù Bullllllshit. I wouldn‚Äôt even trust his screenshots.
---
i love this stuff!  this is just like the woman who posted some pictures of her character in game at the whitesprings resort, followed by pictures of her on vacation at the resort, with pictures that matched her character's pics.  it was beautiful!
---
You'll kinda run into most of the same repetitiveness, where every late-game player is using the exact same Excavator Paintjob, whatever the hardest one to unlock is. Wearing a plain yellow one will immediately become a sign that you're a newb who hasn't finished that Quest-line yet.
---
I asked several people who got banned this time and it turns out most of them were crafting hundreds of thousands diluted stimpacks to level up their alts quickly... well, not most of them, but all of them. Don't think bethesda is wrongfully banning people. It's that they started banning people for mass crafting something other than just boards. So.. um yeah, don't do that
---
Thats where I dump everything too
---
What other games are you looking at now? I‚Äôm trying to decide on something to change to, I‚Äôve lost 550 hrs from this ‚Äúban‚Äù that Idk if I‚Äôm going to bother appealing at this point with this game, but the new big hitters don‚Äôt sit right w me (apex servers suck, anthem seems too repetitive like destiny, metro seems too restrictive since I like open world)
---
pvp ruined the game.
---
Almost every second post on the weekend is about this...
---
No worries. Worst part is if you spend anytime at whitespring killing ghouls you will get rad worms eventually. 
---
I like to deposit level free stuff in the cash registers at random stations and level 45-50 stuff in the blue suitcase

Chances are you wont be here for the next 20...  think about that.  Super slim for the 20 after that.

I want to grow non-diseased Cranberries, Starlight Berries, and Brain Fungus. I love cooking in the game, but I always felt like cultivating plants for food wasn't as fleshed out as it should be. More planters would be a welcomed addition. It could even be a daily event that gives you the ability to unlock certain planters in your camps. It would also let people planting in other players bases with planters that they have, but the CAMP owner does not. Placing Cranberry planters in low level player's bases to help them make Cranberry Relish to level up faster, etc.
---
are you stupid? 
---
Photos or fake....
---
No worries, happy nuking!
---
You can only "carry" one (there is no listed quantity), but the game tracks how much you pick up in the background.
---
Test it out.  Pick up one, turn it in, you get exp.  Pick up two, turn it in, you get more exp.  The EXP is the only way you really know it tracks you picking up multiples.  (I believe it is 350 and 400 exp respectively).  You do not appear to get more exp for quantities above 2.
---
But, if you log switch servers before turning it in, the amount resets back to 1.  Picking up 2, server hopping, and turning in, results in the same exp reward as picking up 1.
---
Same, super annoying to get that outfit without that problem
---
yeah did you even watch the video mate? innocents are wrongly getting banned, and im one of them. ffs
---
Bug, sometimes they work and other times they dont. I assume its got something to do with the workshop bug where mobs spawn in walls or under the map

I've had the same thing happen for me

do you have any junk, like rubber and screws?

Same as last week, cause I believe they reset in about 10 hours. (7pm EST)

I don't get wtf this is.

ok thnx
---
Sorry I don‚Äôt
---
I played all weekend long and every server I was on was full.  Are you sure you're not wanted and just can't see the other players on the map?
---
Plot twist: The character is playing OP.
---
No they aren‚Äôt. And I‚Äôm not stupid dude, I can see you are big on exploits. You‚Äôre clearly not innocent. Just cool your heels. Bethesda was generous enough to decide that once they fix all exploits involved they‚Äôll let you play again. I suggest that when they do, you stop seeking out exploits.
---
No way. Girls have cooties.
---
Unlike the real Watoga in WV. Been there. Just a few cabins and a lot of trees. 
---
I had no idea. Oh well
---
I remember stumbling upon this myself. One of my earliest photos in game

Maybe the bug is the email doesn‚Äôt get sent lol.
---
This is me too. Flatwoods. About every 2 days I'll run through and dump stuff in the Overseers cache on my way to farm caps at the vendor bot in the church.
---
The Live Chic shop in the Whitespring, on a cabinet opposite the counter. 
---
ive never duped, thats what people get banned for, bethesda dont ban you for showing how to fly with the bird bones glitch or spend junk on a vertibot landing pad to level up fast, those are barely exploits, i am innocent mate and so are a lot of other people posting about this. 
---
Lmao so true ü§£
---
It will re-use the wave animation, change the icon to be a Christmas present icon and cost 10$.

Wow that's just ... *so*  dismissive and condescending. You don't agree so it must be a small minority that wants something different from you? Every SBQ fight has half a dozen Excavators who show up, pretty sure that's a significant portion of the community pal.
---
Besides, that's not how updates work. They'll roll out whatever they've been working on for the last month regardless, and if there are requests for new content it'll make its way into later updates, not indefinitely delay important fixes for later while they roll out a sudden new suggestion.
---
hi Lazyway. So sorry, I was asleep at the time of your comment, I'm from the UK. If you would be so kind to help me out, my ID is legacys, truly would be so kind of you! Thank you man!
---
Have you tried this game yourself?
---
its not a current state of what You have on Your character, evry time You pickup something its adding to the 30 days pool i suppose, so yes - crafting character can easy aquire most of items from that list
---
Once I reached 150 I switched to a new character with a completely different build. I now spend my time levelling that character up to complete the build perks and gathering resources and gear for them on my primary character.
---
I've come back to my CAMP to find random people's paper bags sitting in my workshops.  No one around.  I've also dropped stuff in my Teammates camp, then we go out to the other side of the map, come back an hour later and the bag is still there.
---
I wouldn't trust anything important to stay in a bag on the ground (or in a container somewhere) but they don't seem to be resetting by player proximity or time, at least not thru some standard equation.
---
This video was posted the day before the Big Nerf of January 2019 - when they nerfed both the explosive legendary and demolition expert. You wont get those damage numbers on a hunting rifle today.

Stinging magazine, I think.
---
I'm aware of the Excavator lore. My theory regarding Raider power armor is just speculation, a logical extrapolation of several factors.
---
I don't think the wealthy survivors who became raiders in Fallout 76 invented Raider power armor. Identical suits appear in Fallout 4, and that has different raider groups. It's possible that the F76 raiders did invent and manufacture raider power armor, spreading its creation methods to Boston. However, that notion seems unlikely. The F76 raiders don't seem to have any manufacturing facilities and they die off within the timeline of Fallout 76.
---
Raider power armor really appears to be junky power armor adapted from other purposes. It does not appear to be military power armor; it resembles none of the suits whose military creation/evolution we know well from other lore. That means there were civilian power armor suits used for civilian jobs. The fact that we have commercial power armor skins in Fallout 4 (Nuka-Cola, Abraxo, Vim, etc.) further supports that power armor had civilian applications.
---
The Excavator lore does not say that power armor wasn't previously used in mining, only that they had invented a mining power armor that could out-mine their competitors machines. Since raider power armor appears at the entrances of mines (Belching Betty, Lucky Hole, and others), its reasonable to assume that mining was one of the uses to which civilian power armor was put.
---
what kind of people take the time to make comments like this.
---
I asked around and everyone had a good reason to get banned. Most prominently mass crafting diluted stimpacks to level up their alts quickly. Of course, it was considered relatively innocent since everyone was duping back then. 
---
Since the damage perks have diminishing returns on level-up, I run with all 3 at rank 1 for 30%, saving points for barbarian, incisor, and blocker. It leaves a bit of room for weight perks too.
---
Yes I have an it was the biggest waste of my time. There‚Äôs literally no point to the game. Keep downvoting I live on that salt. üòâ
---
The Whitesprings ghouls often give me short time rad worms (10 minutes or something). I prefer going to Camp Venture, the ghouls there will give me one hour of rad worms, that means one hour of +50% boost to almost everything. I always coordinate my farming run to pick up rad worms again after that hour of power has ended. 
---
Yesterday I had 20 lbs of (Known) Plans sitting in my Stash that I finally pitched...

So are douches who post crap like this for no reason at all.

Leary? Thanks. I'll try when I scrounge up a bit of steel. Got 3 left after I scrapped some handies yesterday üòõ
---
I mean it got your attention so must be working. 
---
umm, yeah, i am sure.
---
You are guessing and making assumptions, so no it is not easy. What‚Äôs with you, trying so hard to stir up trouble?
---
Wait, so people are destroying other people's bases for what reason?  So it's ok to go to the clubhouse and grind YOUR way but if someone was doing it their way fuck them?
---
Do what I did, use them to your advantage or close the freaking door on the ground level and it won't be an issue.  
---
K.
---
Lucky for you then everyone is quitting! 
---
Are you sure? Maybe I'm wrong, but doesn't the nerf patch was the same when BGS finally found that Hunting Rifles can't drop as legendary? Which means that someone who looted it, gave to the youtuber and clip have been done was after the nerf?!?!
---
that may be the case for people youve talked to, i dont even have an alt account or a mule and i dont mass craft im actually quiet stingy with my junk and i hoard it in my stash, im only level 164 and i collect weapons and do event after event after event to get caps to buy the weapons off of people... 
---
I had this happen yesterday and I still can't login. I'm hoping I'm not banned but idk really. Seems like there's enough people affected that it's just on their end. Also my game is digital as someone mentioned it might be cause of that. 
---
I got the BOS Legs plan from a Treasure Dig, The BOS Chest from Forbidden Knowledge, but haven't been able to get BOS Arms which is troubling since my character knows about 95% of plans in the game.
---
Did you save the thread by chance?
---
thank you, i cant get it to work tho
---
I also have full servers. One buddy has to wait in que for random to drop out. 
---
Me too. Happened yesterday and I still can't login. Is your game digital? 
---
I guess I do. üòÇ
---
If you don‚Äôt care about having armor piercing, the drum mag holds a ridiculous amount of ammo, too.
---
And yeah it‚Äôs just a matter of gathering mats and making/scrapping guns. :/
---
the thing you have to remember with stairs is they support the entire upper structure, not the walls. So to remove the stairs you have to remove everything supported by them. 
---
I think lighting and turrets use up so much resources as they are animated, i think it's the same with power generators. 
---
there are some camp updates comin, i think they fixed one of the bugs regarding storing electricals with wires where the wires were contributing to the budget. or they are fixing it this patch. 
---
Yeah I've had many issues with their support portal. I think it may have worked best with Firefox. Sucks that it's hard to even get help.
---
I agree with others, don't get the game for PvP. It is currently not worth it.
---
But an upcoming release intends to address this.

There will be a separate survival mode. I'd suggest waiting for this to release and see what people think of it.

You don't really have an opinion about this when you play Destiny üòÇ

Try the goddamn game for a while before you even make a post like this dude.

As someone who was in a real life cult, I should try rping as a cult member...
---
I'm sure the user meant no offense.  There was a post just yesterday where another user was confused cause he kept getting put into "empty" servers.  Turns out he was Wanted and didn't realize people didn't show up when they were wanted.
---
Not sure how you are getting into empty servers.  Off-standard time player?  I play nights (EST) 6-10pm or so, and the servers always have a dozen+ people, and many times my Teammates have to wait in queue to join.
---
I don‚Äôt see this game to be much different than other grindy online multiplayers where you have to level up to achieve some kind of goal. If you think this game has no point, then why do you think some other similar type, grindy multiplayers do have a point? Or are you here just trolling
---
Think its the stinging, yes. 35 round and armor penetration. Its the best one to have, I think. Get the plans. Make a bunch of lvl15 rifles. Scrap them. Eventually you will get it. 
---
If you're on PC I can craft it for you, free of charge. 
---
Having 150+ more DR ER and RR in other Armors is also "ridiculously useful"
---
Brilliant idea!
---
Appreciate the effort tho mate, I‚Äôll figure it out hopefully. If I legitimately am getting falsely banned then I‚Äôm going for a refund cba
---
I don‚Äôt post much in Reddit but yea I play destiny but honestly I haven‚Äôt play many games at all for the last couple of days. Good comeback though m8. üòâ

Post-putch merchants sucks. I won't ever get scrinned BOS underwear, I guess.
---
If you think that then I am very concerned for you.
---
I've got a 3* Instigating Bolt Action Pipe Rifle w/ 50% Vats Crit?
---
If that‚Äôs the case then it‚Äôs wrongful banning. Crafting diluted stimpacks using items you got legitimately should not get you banned. 
---
I have pretty much the opposite experience of others here. My higher level may be a factor, but I have never taken a workshop without someone attempting to claim it from me or attacking me while I am building or defending.
---
I just stopped claiming them as I don't really need the free fast travel or plans anymore. Plus I hate having to start over on junk gathering.  
---
I‚Äôll admit I just love trolling the 76 fan base cause ya‚Äôll get so triggered all the time.
---
Don't know why you're downvoted. I completely agree. 
---
Over the last month, at least on PS4, I definitely noticed this as well. It's been pretty nice. 
---
Awesome tip thanks! If you can handle the negative effects being boosted as well this sounds well worth it.
---
Yep. If you're not a general in the enclave, you can't get down into the silos.
---
Nope. Im pretty sure about this. The patch notes are from january 29. I also know the hunting rifles spawned before the nerf. I found a two shot hunting rifle, which was really fun for about a week or so :-)
---
Unless they fixed it, you can plant things on top of campfires indoors. I made my ‚Äògreenhouse‚Äô into more of a... ‚Äòritual room‚Äô... due to the odd burning bush aesthetic.

You don't need a fusion generator (which needs things from your stash to build) -- just power up the plant.  That also provides power to some other workshops, e.g. Monongah provides power to the ammunition factory.
---
I've read that, and still think it works, but I'd like to have the white planters instead.  I like the looks.
---
My farm of all the veggies and fruits outside works just fine.
---
You mean the next shot will be a crit and not use up the crit?  If so, no I didn't.  
---
Most guides on critting involve getting really high luck or clover and you can chain without that, or used to be able to.
---
You were banned for duping, or trading for duped items.
---
&gt; That or ~~dyslexia~~ Asian.

(I kid...)
---
After all the press, I can't believe people like you will still come around trying to make people feel bad about enjoying something.

Tf is wrong with you?  Gtfo.

I used to be an adventurer like you... then I took a nuke to the head.

Someone‚Äôs salty. üòâ
---
I did forget nerd rage, but not the rest. 
---
But there are melee with like 3k, and I'm sure the base isn't above 200 on the one I most recently saw, so I'm trying to figure out how. It prob is cheese, maybe even old exploits, but if not...
---
Thanks m8. üëçüèº
---
I have a quad barrel explosive can you add a mod to that??
---
Because it's so much better when the owner spawns off the cliff and falls to their death. If people don't know about moving the CAMP machine to fix their spawn point, there are areas that are unbuildable due to this.
---
Energy. I can take quite a few in my leathers.
---
Thanks. I do have the stinging mag. What confused me is the lack of consistency on the site I linked to.
---
lmao your entire post history is just posting shit like this for every game
---
you gotta be more creative
---
&gt; More people than not actually have 0 email. And have a wrongful accusation of 100,000 items
---
Which?  No email or a wrongful accusation?  It can't be both.
---
Still need help?
---
&gt; but haven't received any since the last patch.
---
I haven't received armor/mod plans, but I still have received 3x BOS T-60 paint plans.
---
I get more 1* Heavy Combat armor pieces than I know what to do with though.  Some of it's a nice upgrade.  1* Regenerating Heavy Combat Torso, 1* Ghoul's Heavy Combat Arm and 1* Zealot's Heavy Combat Arm and Leg.  I'm decked out in 1* BOS Heavy Combat these days from it, at 200% repair condition.
---
Thinking beth just grew tired of dupers sending tickets so they copy pasted big numbers and replied back. But I don't have any problem with that. You see that 22k nuka grape? That's a ban hammer for you. 
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Treetops](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Treetops) is good for a Megasloth. You might have to server hop a few times. My camp is there and I always get a Megasloth or Snallygasters or Honey beasts
---
hmm, Think im going to try this game out again but this time look for solo servers. Seems like a blast to be by yourself.
---
Yes this happened to me yesterday, eventually started working again
---
I would wait till they release the survival mode next month, that should give you an idea if the game is worth getting from a PVP perspective. I would not recommend buying it today
---
Sorry, to "leary" thing is a silly pseudo-Japanese thing. They don't know the difference between R and L, for the most part, so it's the reverse of "really". Again, sorry, because it's obviously not appropriate here ;)
---
Digital
---
What system?
---
&gt; most of them were crafting hundreds of thousands of diluted stimpacks to level up their alts quickly
---
How?
---
Yeah, but try to make some sort of a silly cult like the sons of atom.
---
&gt;‚ÄúHurr durr, like, ya kill guys and get stuff. It‚Äôs exactly the same!‚Äù
---
Gotta love fallacies
---
&gt;See, that‚Äôs the funny thing about the internet. It‚Äôs really easy to pretend you‚Äôre something you‚Äôre not. But the truth is... the best case scenario for why you‚Äôre sitting here defending yourself and listening to me call you a fucking dumbass, for trying to say F76 pvp = Souls pvp lol... is that you‚Äôre butthurt. Maybe because of my insults, or maybe you‚Äôre just butthurt in general. Doesn‚Äôt really matter.
---
The irony
---
&gt;We‚Äôve already established that I‚Äôm trolling. Are you trolling too? Because if so, you‚Äôre pretty shit at it.
---
Then why do you keep feeding me so much?
---
&gt;Choose your next words carefully. 
---
Holy fuck man you are really badass! And you question why I'm still replying lmfao
---
Exactly ;)
---
happened to me twice
---
Hahaha that is amazing, shame people can just log out the second things start going bad for them though, can't tell you how many times I've hunted wanted players only for them to just log out when I start ganking them :\
---
Just how do you get hundreds of thousands of purified water and stimpacks legitmately? I'm very curious to know.
---
Oh ok. I thought I made an accidental Bill Burr joke. Badum tish.
---
Then you done something else and you just don't want to share it with us
---
Only issue I've ever had with these events are the legendary enemies being killed off as soon as I spawn at the event. 
---
The event where you have to find the horde, I found it you have to go to a specific spot in order for it to tell you whether this is or isn't the source. Like the Nuka Cola plant, even though I know where the "source" is, I still have to get on the roof above the source before it'll go to the next step. 
---
I setup my first camp near Mama Dolces. There's a shack that spawns power armor near just down the hill from the entrance. Just above that is a generator outside another shack which spawns a fusion core. Always had plenty of core's available to me.
---
Honestly, I don't notice any negative effects. Carrying capacity in Excavator (+ calibrated shocks) going up into the high 600s is reason enough alone. And all bobblehead and magazine bonuses get those extra 50% as well, so you can easily offset any particular negatives.
---
Ok, let's take for a moment that what you are saying is completely true (which it isn't) .
---
Getting that amount of each of those types of ammo every day is really tough.  You would have to only grind for ammo and stuff to make ammo.
---
Every day
---
Even if you had friends helping, that is a lot of time grinding for ammo.
---
What you are actually doing with this post is purposefully trying to stir up false controversy and outrage by PURPOSEFULLY ignoring the very obvious stuff that caused this person (Not You) to be rightfully banned.
---
If you don't like the game, then leave and play something else, but get off your "Stop liking what I don't like" horse. 
---
Tf? Is it really that hard to believe that I am among the 100s of people that are getting this message and haven‚Äôt actually done anything to deserve it, you really have that much faith in Bethesda‚Äôs coding and banning algorithms?
---
If that was before the nerf that would explain the numbers - I've also had 700+ damage on my TSE Lever Rifle before the nerfing patch.
---
On ps4 and xbox too though...
---
You know excess salt is bad for your health, right?
---
But on a more face to face mature remark, gonna try to pull you up to a better level.
---
Why do you enjoy 'triggering' people?  Would you act like this in person towards a group of people talking about this game?  And if yes, why?  Why would you randomly walk into a group and start bashing on them for liking something?
---
Blue suitcase at any rail station is where I do the drop when I have excess.
---
If I see a lower level close by, I do the "follow me" at the blue bag and when they approach, I step back.  There should be some sort of emote for this
---
It is my dream to play in an abandoned server so that I can finally traverse white springs without getting completely obliterated by a group of ghouls who are thrice my level. One can dream..
---
You speak like someone defending a minority. Thankyou for that, I've been experiencing some shellshock irl and really needed a good laugh. 
---
My point is simple: priorities.
---
I don't want to wait an extra month for an update so you can paint your excavator suit. Bethesda has sucked a heap of consumer money providing a fairly broken game, I'm with those with pitch forks and fire ready to start a lawsuit. Theres promised updates of things like player vending and new vaults.
---
Also reason the Atom shop has its shit together is because its being looked after by another company, a company with a sense of forward-planning which has been remarkably absent from Bethesda Studios.
---
Your excavator suit can go in the whitesprings trashcan for all I care buddy, and to be condescending I care even less. Labelling my opinion as condescending on its own is a laugh because you have evidently over-valued your own opinion in saying that. 
---
I know how you feel, the discord faction I'm with has got more silent since the tse nerf patch.
---
There were at least 20+ members and I'm lucky if 4 are speaking, most days it's just me posting something hoping for a reply which never comes.
---
Also I‚Äôd like to point out I don‚Äôt have an email saying I‚Äôm banned and I have no response from tickets saying I‚Äôm banned and no reasoning for this message popping up. 
---
So many little pricks piping up saying shit. I have this problem too..never duped, I have stacked concrete though

---
So according to your beliefs they can track where the items come from and have a rolling tally of what ammo you've acquired in the past 30 days? 
---
Well then maybe they saw this account was acquiring large amounts of the ammo in question from duping and not in fact crafting them? 
---
I think it's all BS just pointing out a hole in your argument.
---
Exactly, it‚Äôs not just me... a lot of people that are innocent are getting affected
---
I feel you. The game is a grind fest to the max and at least for me it‚Äôs relaxing. But for lots of others it‚Äôs hard to find that enjoyment when there‚Äôs nothing to do :/
---
Lol, you‚Äôre just smart enough to think you‚Äôre clever without actually understanding what‚Äôs happening to you. Aw. So cute.
---
Well, that was a pretty shit ending, but I guess you did your best.
---
Have a nice day, kiddo. Nothing personnel.
---
Wait, you can get BoS gear? That's news to me. I've only gotten chems and ammo. 
---
I‚Äôm xbox but thank you !
---
That's funny, I was just gonna say that about you.  It's concerning when a human being, an animal known by science to have clear empathetic tendencies, arbitrarily without seeming reason or cause begins acting apathetically towards others of its kind.
---
What happened to you?  You weren't like this as a child I'm willing to bet, who taught you to enjoy causing strife?
---
We only got disconnected once, and never crashed per se, just things seemed laggy. I had hoped what with recent patches I wouldn't be seeing the "Server not responding" thing, but it was not to be I guess. 
---
Thanks for the replies!

Fuck yeah, finally back to 35 rounds. Time to kill... something, after a nap to gain that 5% bonus üòâ
---
I'm always in PA and this happens regularly to me on my i7 8700. Could be related to that slick inventory view the PA uses. It can happen in nuke zones (RadX/Radaway active) or in normal environments (no active effects or mutations).
---
I submitted a feedback today but those don't get tracked. I once submitted a regular tech support ticket with an undrelated CTD (where there was even a proper crash dump), but they just keep repeating the "update drivers mantra".
---
I'd say wait a few more months and see how (and if) they fix any of the still existing issues with the game.

You can fit 3 rank 1 cards in with other cards.

Very annoying.

I hear you on scorchbeast. I lured one to the golf club from outside the resort for the sole reason some toolbox had set up their camp behind tbe golf club.  It was pretty entertaining as it basically leveled their camp.  Fuckos!

C'mon people, get out of the Excavator. You can afford to drop a few pounds. I'll give you my t51! IT's RED

If you are in Germany, you can get F76 free of charge with new PS4 controller (Saturn).
---
Yes, you can skip certain things.
---
Uncle Sam is skipped by going to Sam's bunker directly before completing the Belly of the Beast which sends you to investigate Sam and find his bunker.
---
I found it easier to get access to the Enclave prior to finishing Belly of the Beast.  So I did not complete Uncle Same, but did every quest after it.
---
How about you just grind it out like the rest?  We were all there at one point.  Kind of like the level 5 loser that ‚Äúacquired‚Äù a 1000dmg TSE without earning it.

Well I was part of some severely two if not three-faced spirituality money scheme.  I won't put others through that, if anything I'll take what little good I got out of that experience and probably setup at that temple with the guided meditation event, and have peeps grab that guided meditation holotape.
---
Then I'll spout off about how God or Creator is omnipresent and nonjudging and is just creating all these things to better get to know itself cause it's omniscient only about it's creations and not itself, and maybe give it an elder scrolls aedra vibe with some weird crazy origin story and background stories.  Azura be my inspiration!
---
Ding ding ding f‚Äôin ding!
---
I just want some clarification, yes i know that 200k+ ultracite ammo and nuka-grapes are 100% from duping or crafted from duped materials. Strange for me is why the common ammo is on that list - only that
---
Fallout 76, the MMO, better when played alone. It really just never ends with this game...
---
Yep this is where l drop 100 scrap of stuff all the time, maybe some low level weapons and gear with a couple stimpaks just to be a nice guy
---
It counts towards the Excavator carry weight!!!!
---
Dude I always have mad cloth so I make gunpowder. I have like 6000 gunpowder right now and I‚Äôm melee. If you‚Äôre worried about 900..... idk
---
Sounds amazing. Sometimes you get similar if you stay on a server long enough, but everything is farmed :( and it‚Äôs never really completely abandoned. 
---
Sometimes the nearby enemy faction kills your target before you even get there via fast-travel. 
---
I had my target Legendary Super Mutant lvl 68 killed by a dozen Gutsies at the chemical plant just before I appeared. Then they almost killed me with their anti-armor pistols - I can take the SBQ in the face and smile but those Gutsies are a real pain.
---
I think I'm gonna have to pitch Stimpaks eventually.  I'm up to 190, and keep getting more and more.  Yesterday I finally finished Belly of the Beast, I had 175 going in and figured I'd be walking out with much less.  Instead I walked out with 185...  Some of those creature corpses were carrying 2-3 each.
---
hmm... including the system you play on mighhhhht be of importance here
---
Marine armor under a white tuxedo or my hand-crafted clown suit
---
i just want some clarification about what common ammo doing on that list
---
I reckon I've probably found all named markers on the map but I did stumble across a mine that's not on the map, there must be loads of unlisted areas to find.
---
check your data for events/misc, i joined an horde event but it was somehow unflagged (as in not tracked). retracking it made me see the locations and such that needed to be searched.
---
other than that, its most likely one of the other things people mentioned in their replies
---
There a Lb a piece and take up alot of room in storage IMO. Its supposed to snow all day here, maybe I'll jump online and randomly help.out low level players today
---
That article is from November 2018 and related to the beta. Won‚Äôt help now.
---
They said it violated rule number 7... rumor even though multiple people with error are literally getting banned.
---
Unyielding sentinel for general gameplay. 
---
1) I am level 100+, have logged 500+ hours, and been playing since launch. Even before all the recent patches, I never experienced any bugs I personally considered game-breaking.  I've had a blast playing this game and continue to do so. 
---
2) As other people have said, you can earn atoms by completing challenges.  However, there is really very little in the Atom shop that I personally want.  I picked up a paint job for my power armor, a lamp for my camp, and a couple character poses for photomode, but that's pretty much it.  Most of the stuff in the atomic shop has a "new" look to it and I prefer my camp to retain that gritty, wasteland look. Here's an older link which gives some more info on the atomic shop and challenges  https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/2a4GTCpUPyEsGCGYWyM6Q2/welcome-to-the-atomic-shop
---
3) For the most part, the in-game community is awesome. Higher level players often drop stim packs, water, plans, meds, and low level weapons with legendary effects for newer players to pick up. As with any online game, you're going to encounter griefers every now and then, but I personally find it to be rare. It is far more common (for me, at least) to team up with some random player to complete an event, give each other the thumbs up emote, and go about our business.
---
Something to keep in mind is that 76 is not "Fallout 5".  You may need to adjust your playing style to match the game's mechanics. For example, inventory management is extremely important in this game as you have a limited amount of space in your stash and can't horde infinite amounts of materials.  Pulling up your pip boy will not pause the game and vats doesn't slow down time.  But, for me, all this adds to the immersive quality of the game. 
---
Do you use VPNs when you play? My friend who never used a single exploit or duped got hit with it, and I'm actually the one who used the weight and XP exploits lol.
---
I can still play the game without a hitch, the previous patch was great, this stealth patch got a lot of false flags it seems.
---
I mean I thought I was sure.  Wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúanchored‚Äù to a server via friends, party or otherwise.   So if I leave and come back I should be serve hopping, no?  Even restarted the game several times.   
---
How do *you* server hop?   Maybe I am doing it wrong. 
---
i find something new almost daily, im lvl 132 as well. it‚Äôs fun to just ‚Äúexist‚Äù there as opposed to only doing missions
---
Ya, I have traveling pharmacy so they are only 0.1 lbs each for me.  Otherwise I'd definitely be dropping them off.  They weigh so little these days I barely noticed them that's why they were up to 195 before I thought about it.
---
Nope.   
---
For fallout, get Fallout 4 if you haven't. For great PVP Survival, donno. Maybe Ark or Conan Exiles? Hell, maybe Destiny 2 if you're a PS4 player.   
---
But Fallout 76 is a big disappointment unless your a huge Fallout fan.   
---
The combat's no where near what it should be for an online or multiplayer game. That's not a surprise as it's from a single player rpg that had a timestop mechanic to let you strategize.   
---
The PVP is also not really there. Think World of Warcraft "same faction" pvp where you have to invite someone to duel. Even then I wouldn't want to do PVP with this system.   
---
The PVE is ok, but like I said, the combat engine was meant for single player with slowtime, and this is realtime. So expect to get overrun frequently and just straight out killed when you are. Fallout 4 supported save/load before a fight so you could keep trying and the engine really works with that. Fallout 76 doesn't. You just die and get re-spawned back at base. 
---
I got hit as well
---
[Here is the email](https://imgur.com/a/K7LRE7h) 
---
Talking to support about this was like talking to a brick wall. Copy and paste responses. I told them to pull my account up themselves and look in my inventory and they will see that they are wrong.
---
Keep joining different friends. If it says join it‚Äôs on a different server
---
That may be true, but I will stand behind the idea that my setup is far less vulnerable to Bethesda's future nerfs. üòâ
---
&gt;re are ways to get your pvp "fix" in 76.  The main way is workshop hunting.  Check to see which workshops are owned, tho
---
100% spot on. Even with it's upcoming pvp mode, this system isn't great for pvp. 
---
Thanks! But I'm on PS4 sadly but I already deleted save files :/ Didn't help.
---
No and I'm the only one in the network who plays FO76.
---
Its was told by bethesda that they track what people pickup. They dont have to know where it came from they just tracking what You picked up and then adding it to the 30 days pool, after 30 days just count all from pool / over 100k items - flag/ban. Yes thats only my speclations but its easiest way to make it. You can tell me other way how that system can work??
---
My social list used be full like a week ago, now only 1 or 2 people online. It has well and truly died, people will come back a little when they add the dungeons, the PvP servers, but by not putting out constant updates or even events within a quite lack luster game (in regards to content) then everyone is just moving onto something else. He'll, I've got Apex open while writing this message
---
Nah. Just let the folks that *want* to PvP play together and those of us who *don't* want PvP play together. Then the PvPers can happily spend their time stalking and killing each other over and over and the PvEers can happily spend their time stalking and killing NPC mobs over and over. No PvEers griping about being PKed or landing in wanted mode for accidentally blasting another player's cabin or having to go PvP to use public workshops or whatever. And no PvPers griping about how no one wants to PvP or it's the only endgame and is broken or PvP weapons getting off-balanced due to PvE balancing or whatever.
---
There'd still be issues, but separate PvP and PvE servers would contain quite a bit of the gripes between the two fronts of players.
---
Well at first I was joining a friend.  But when that happened I left their game and they were no long ‚Äúon my map‚Äù so I assumed I had left their server.  And it seems like every time I‚Äôve ‚ÄúQuit‚Äù a game and come back in, it was on a map with new players and thus I figured that was a new server. Am I wrong?
---
Not sure. Maybe. Joining friends is guaranteed though
---
I think Blocker is necessary because certain high-level enemies, like Super Mutants and Scorched, seem like they have Anti-Armor melee weapons, in the same way that Colonel Gutsys are notorious for their magic armor-bypassing bullets.  I can tank bullets like no tomorrow, but the minute someone swings an axe, there goes 1/5 of my HP.  And because avoiding melee is kind of dodgy (you often get hit if you're anywhere within one square mile of the enemy), a rank or two of Blocker doesn't go amiss.
---
Over-valued... Oh, ya that's me. Nobody else agrees with me about this, that's why I don't have the top comment in this thread.
---
And again, us speculating about things we might want in the future doesn't mean you'll have to wait longer for the patches that have been in the works for weeks or months. They don't start fresh after each update going "what do they want next?", they have a bunch of works-in-progress that they develop until they think it's ready to be added. Important functionality fixes, and the new content they're finally planning to roll out isn't going to be delayed just because some fans go on Reddit and talk about how much they wish they had more than yellow paint. When the fanbase asks for something cosmetic like this, it's a suggestion for many months down the line.
---
Don't know where you're getting the absurd idea that because we want a Paintjob they'll drop everything else they're doing to rush it out, instead of rolling out the other stuff that's in the works.
---
Do they conaider explosive vents rare? Probably got a few thousands of those. No honestly I never had even hundreds of nuka colas, atom keycards, probqably never over 2000 junk of one kind, just a few hundred self-crafted serums and may got 500-600 fluxes over last 30 days.
---
Yes, you can get the following Outfits: BOS Lab coat, BOS Science Scribe, BOS Field Scribe, BOS Soldier Uniform, BOS Fatigues, BOS Engineers Outfit.
---
The Engineers Outfit is very Rare, &amp; really cool looking.
---
I sell them for 750 caps &amp; include the Welding Helmet.

You are correct n shouldn‚Äôt be downvoted. Turret kills alone will NOT grant exp or loot. Cheers here‚Äôs an upvote

What system are you on?
---
Ah. I requested you as soon as you posted that but you didnt add me. Oh well.
---
Thats some 500iq shit
---
Thanks. I'll check the quest log too. I never get specific points to show on my map except in the wolf horde that appears after you do leader of the pack. So maybe it's not flagging or soemthing. 
---
Charleston station across the tracks in the half destroyed building there can be one 
---
Let's hope it IS some kind of bug, the ban being seemingly random as it is. My account hasn't been banned (yet), and I have done some of the things you mention you never did, but I only did them for a short period of time, and months ago (original carry weight glitch and a handful of levels xp glitching [from 36 to 50, specifically], but never any duping or picking up high-stacked loot). Not proud of that, but it's behind me, and I've been playing nice and legit ever since.
---
Let's hope the upcoming patch will sort out all those false positives.
---
I've dropped over 100 Tech Data, and never received any legendary Armor, but I know several other people who say they have.
---
I did receive many plans from it prior to the last patch, but none since. 
---
LOL fair enough argument. I suppose they could just go most recently added... orrrr... heaviest items first / lightest items first. Could just have it randomly start deleting items (including stacks) once every 10seconds after the timer ends until it gets below the carry weight. I'm not too sure what would be easiest to implement, I just am trying to throw some ideas around, some probably make a lot more sense than others... I just reallllllly want this game to succeed more!! =)
---
this is probably the worst place to ask about PVP as this sub is very anti pvp.  the vast majority of people in this sub dont want PVP to even be a part of the game.  The people here would say anything to get PVP players to play another game so the servers have less PVPers.  That being said, the game isnt balanced at all for PVE or PVP, hopefully in time this will be resolved, but in its current state i wouldnt recomend this to anyone who cares a lot about PVE OR PVP mechanics.  that being said the most fun ive had in this game was fighting over workshop resources with another player, but the majority of my time has been spent just exploring and building cool camps.  Less than 1% of my playing time has been PVP
---
Wasn‚Äôt there something in a recent (or upcoming, don‚Äôt remember) patch that makes it so accidental hits on another camp doesn‚Äôt get you wanted?  It now takes clear intent with multiple hits.
---
I received this login error (On PC). I submitted a ticket and went through the usual steps, restart PC, reinstall game. After the support tech told me he would escalate my ticket I received the ban email.

The outdated memes are just weird though. I get you want to be a tough guy but 4chan references kinda chaunce your domers there.
---
&gt; So I do the logical thing. I tell my girlfriend I love her and run like hell.
---
I almost spit out my coffee reading that!
---
Yoy don't need to collect the pieces you can look up the codes online the quest will skip that step
---
 Nothing else, after that the only thing to do is grind caps to buy shit and level you character up for nothing. I have fun finding low level players and giving them a sweet camp with all the higher level stuff
---
Mostly, it's about making Caps to buy expensive things and trying to collect all the Power Armor types, and doing the Daily Challenges.
---
That's soooo last week.  Try using mats (welcome mats, rugs, etc.).
---
Just read about that, haven't had a chance to experiment yet.  Looks like it works about the same, with less floating and conflagration.  Seems to work for plants as well as other buildables such as generators and water treatment.
---
Again,
---
Over-sentimental consumers spoiled with choice.
---
Please consider how Ironic it is to call someone elses comment condescending... i cant stop laughing
---
Sure ok. But if Bethesda ‚Äúclarifies‚Äù this, now everyone knows how to exploit just enough to avoid getting punished. Defeats the purpose.
---
I feel you man..... I defended this game to the bitter end, now look üòÇüòÇ
---
That's not a ban code. Its trouble connecting to server
---
PC, sorry. My bad.
---
I honestly don't believe it's fair to say *most* of us don't enjoy the game. There's lots to enjoy about the game and the experience of playing with friends and the occasional enemy after all. That's why so many people are upset about the bugs and broken parts. 
---
If you *truly* don't enjoy it, put it down and walk away. There's no harm to deciding you're not enjoying something and walking away from it. But there is likely something harmful in insisting on participating in a recreational activity that you don't enjoy.
---
You can also get these by scrapping assaultron blades.
---
No, only blood and crit need  :((
---
I would have rather had them come out and tell me I am banned than wasting 1.5 hours of my time playing their diagnostics game.
---
This week.  Not sure which day.  I suspect Tuesday or Thursday.
---
I love my X-01 but rarely break it out.  not because I don't want to fix it, but because I haven't got the shocks for it yet and like the extra carry weight Excavator gives you
---
Ring-a-ding-ding, baby!
---
They were very clear that private servers weren't going to be a thing for at least a year.
---
Am I missing something? Don‚Äôt think you can have duals but that would be sick
---
I'm at 140+
---
I've collected all the PA sets, Marine and Combat Armor at the highest level for when we can display them in CAMP.  Thinking about the BoS set now
---
Got the plan for the Excavator Calibration but farming for the fluxes to build them
---
Waiting for new Atom Store PA paint jobs
---
Experimenting with CAMP stuff.  I finally got the Signs &amp; Letters and going to do a Decontamination chamber ext.
---
But ultimately yeah, its not that exciting until there is new content.  I think the next step is to   restart with a new character.  (Or replay FO4, I never got into camp building with FO4 and I've read there that FO4 has more camp stuff functionality)
---
As much as I love Bo,S I don't think they'd be the only people interested in securing T.D.'s I feel like it should be a fraction quest. A bot at the Enclave, a spot in one of the bunkers for the Free States, hell you could potentially turn them into Rose for the Raiders. Then it would have a much much more diverse loot pool. In terms of stacking the T.D.'s I can already (kind of) do that with a low level character that hasn't started the BoS questline. So if you have someone you play with that is down to ferry a low level toon farm T.D.s with it and then drop it in a hidden container and switch characters. It's tedious but it does get the job done.
---
I tend to get legendary armors about... 15% of the time?  Just a rough estimate based on my personal experience.  Small sample size for such a low chance item.
---
I always try to grab two before each turn in.  And usually do 1 to 3 turn ins a day.  Only plan on one, but if I play long enough and get more after that first turn in during my Vendor run each day, I will stop by and turn it in and check the multiple Plan/Mod spawn locations.
---
Ghoul's Heavy Arm, Zealot's Heavy Leg, Zealot's Heavy Armor, Cloaking Heavy Arm, Unyielding Heavy Arm, Regenerating Heavy Torso, Cloaking Heavy Arm.
---
Lots of Arms for me... always seems to be Heavy Combat too, never Legendaries for any other armor types.
---
Okay, thanks. I didn't realize that. I took my time, am lv85 without finishing the main quest and kind of burnt myself out. 
---
Maybe if I don't have to grind the 8 keys, I'll check it out. I would just need to nuke keycard then, right?
---
As a heads up to everyone, he's promoting his own video and acting like he is promoting someone else's video. He is Tyr.
---
https://www.reddit.com/user/RoflCopterMLGK
---
He also has a long history of posting glitches and exploits, and comments claiming 76 is a broken dead end game and promoting the use of found exploits.
---
id love to see different paint jobs for it. would be cool if they enabled all previous paint jobs for the excavator power armor and the ultracite power armor
---
Yes keycard and use the code most people just post it on here but theres a site with the codes for each week
---
I hope so but I was locked out for 1 week around a month ago. Had that pipboyless bug... It's annoying to wait for patches but I probably get used to by the time.
---
You‚Äôre so dumb, it‚Äôs cute lol. I don‚Äôt want to ruin it, so let‚Äôs leave it there, yeah?
---
As in, goodbye. This is where you say goodbye and get on with your life.
---
Gonna friend request when I get home.  I also don't use a mic and could use a pal to just run around with. I'm lvl 17 and could really use a hand tracking down some lvl 15 raider power armor (I know it's hard)
---
Yeah I've gotten that once or twice. I think it's in preparation for survival mode coming out soon.
---
Check https://nukacrypt.com/solved for the launch codes. Same across all platforms.
---
Ahh all right, I wouldn't have read anything about the game before it released. Thanks :)
---
The only fun thing are the quests
---
Bethesda is posting this on Twitter:    Greetings, if you are receiving error message 4:8:2000 please submit a support ticket through http://help.bethesda.net  so we may further assist you.
---
Imagine all of those people that were hunting the dupers picking up all of their stuff, lololol.
---
Well, to be fair, it wasn't necessarily Yellow who spawned the ghouls. Whitesprings is almost always crawling with higher level players.
---
Uhm it‚Äôs no secret I‚Äôm Tyr? I used to be called roflcopter but you can‚Äôt change your reddit username, What kinda tin foil are you wearing ?
---
Long history you mean the two infinite xp videos and the flying bird bones mutation? Get a grip ya wacko I‚Äôm trying to spread awareness to this because nobody else is, and no shit it‚Äôs a broken game IT JUST BANNED HEAPS OF PEOPLE FOR NO REASON lol 
---
That's right!
---
Well... you know how :D
---
Especially Since before you get the Quest to hand in the Technical Data you could potentially have a stack of a dozen or more, which disappears down to a single item when you get the quest.
---
First time me and my mate found a grafton was at white springs. We bolted towards it, planning this whole tactical army shit. Anyway he forgot that his gun wasn‚Äôt suppressed and fucked the whole thing after the first shot
---
A lot of AP, grenades, deaths and bullets later, us 2 level 5‚Äôs took down a level 20 grafton
---
Yeah, they would be hit as well now.
---
doh PC.
---
If you server hop it spawns in every time as soon as you cross the bridge and then cross back towards the train station. 
---
Agreed, Gutsies are either beyond broken, or the one real challenge late / end game, depending on your level. Their slim profile means they don't get into one another's way, and five or seven of them have perfect line of sight towards you, and their aim is never off, either.
---
They always pull me out of my peaceful and serene routine of slaughtering the Watoga robots, but I've grown to love the adrenaline rush I get out of them.
---
Log into bethesda.net and login there. If you cant your banned
---
What is the ban code then?
---
Try un equipping gunsmith perk and re equipping it. Maybe the system isn't registering gunsmith.
---
what a wanker you are honestly.... oh someones sharing there own video explaining the problem that they worked really hard to make because there legit is no other videos on youtube talking about it
---
&gt; By the way they advertised before it came out it is Fallout 5.
---
They did? Where? I don't recall ever seeing "Fallout 5" in any advertisements. I'd be happy to admit I'm wrong if you can demonstrate where, exactly, they advertised what became Fallout 76 as Fallout 5.
---
This game *is* set in the Fallout universe, so there a whole lot wrong with the idea of not giving it the name Fallout. Fallout is the name of the universe where these games are set. If you don't call it Fallout, you have to scrap the robots and the dystopian, nuclear 50s setting, ditch the nukes and the Communist propaganda, get rid of the laser and plasma guns, 86s the Vaults, and basically nuke from orbit the entire game because they'd have to *start completely from scratch*. It'd be a *new* IPO and a new game.
---
Oh, and btw, names mean something. Fallout 2 is not Fallout:NV is not Fallout 4 is not Fallout 76 *is not* Fallout 5. They're *all* different games. And that is identified by *different names*. Just like your parents named you whatever it is they did to differentiate you from your siblings and other random people.
---
I am banned and can still login to bethesda.net 
---
Little confused because *you're the one*  who started calling us spoiled and over-sentimental just because you disagree. *You're*  the one shitting down on the community for talking about things they like, because *what you want*  is a bigger priority.
---
That's like a textbook example of condescending. Pretty sure if I looked up Condescending in the dictionary it'd say "See also: Uberlux"
---
Screws, springs, fiberglass, asbestos...
---
i play with a friend of mine, together we could have a 4 person party, yall are welcome to add me PSN - piwrecks
---
Yes it does still give you a bottle cap towards your caps stash
---
Its long.
---
Lol üòÇ 
---
Has nothing to do with the nuka or the ultracite 
---
Do you formally say goodbye to every stranger online or just the ones you got a crush on?
---
Do you have any idea what might have flagged you?
---
On Xbox live you can post a 'looking for group post' players use these to buy/sell items on fo76,
---
Every game in Xbox has this LFG posting place 
---
There‚Äôs always a pair spawning on watoga station 
---
Just the cute ones, yeah.
---
PS4 
---
This game doesn‚Äôt have an entire point. It has different points that matter to different people who play it for different reasons. 
---
Splendid! Now I know where to look. 
---
I‚Äôve enjoyed it because i can now identify at least one of my PAs in Stash
---
Banned players cant access the website to fill tickets. When you get banned from zenimax all your accounts get closed. Past games and website all gone
---
Someone prolly took the plan for it, and has been crafting to sell to vendors maybe?
---
though there are better things for that though..
---
To the front page with you!
---
Where are these challenges listed?  I always get notifications that I have completed thingd, but never am intentionally trying to. 
---
Didn't find this text lines in my .ini file
---
Remember when I said its possible that you over-value your opinion?
---
Well you just told me you have something to add the dictionary hahaha
---
oh yeah I forgot to do my challenges yesterday
---
Good thing you were able to escape.  When player vending machines come out, I can see some filthy raiders putting one right in the middle of a room like that.  Probably got the idea form [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_7_mfcpy7w).
---
Hmm, wonder what Bethesda‚Äôs idea of ‚Äòcasual‚Äô will be...
---
So have you been able to get back in? I‚Äôve been locked out since Friday. 
---
Oh good to know. I still can login and made a ticket already. But still, why the fuck does this happen at all...
---
Same. Dunno then
---
smart people?
---
this game was created upon a franchise with a huge fan base...
---
the purchase wasnt a rational thing, it\`s been pretty much an emotional thing.
---
"Fallout? love the games! oh Multiplayer game, natively, nice!"
---
The footage before release and all the advertising were still not what the game is, today.
---
Thanks, still can login. This is just ridiculous...
---
I did! Sadly, still no luck. Thank you so much though for presenting it as an option - I appreciate it! 
---
Tomorrow right ? 
---
To start with a 200 extra carrying weight and new challenges ‚Äúwasteland whatever ‚Äú
---
That part was kinda jokey 
---
No, I used cliched old joke about looking up a word and finding a picture of someone. At no point did I say I could add to or improve the dictionary.
---
I use mainly a bloodied deathclaw and rank 3 of slugger but when I go into a nuke zone and put on PA I swap to the 3 two handed perks and I have them at rank 1. That‚Äôs 30% for 3 points. You have to spend another 6 points in order to get another 30%?! Naw. Imo it‚Äôs best to use three rank 1s so you can use rank 3 of the other essentials for STR melee build. 
---
That's the theory I'm gonna test. I know for a fact sometime my weight reduction perks don't activate and I have to go switch them on and off. I've also had them double. I adventure around 300ish weight but at times it will drop to 250ish and stay like that until I dc. I have a suspicion perks don't always populate correctly.
---
Those things don't provide any value whatsoever when i'm running around inside a blast zone being mobbed by glowing ghouls. I could have my camp right next to the train station and they wouldn't matter. 
---
It's got some good parts and some bad parts like anything else.  Anthony Rapp as Stamets is a particularly standout character.
---
r/woooosh
---
dont pay full price, get a 76% off sale for sure, maybe half off
---
yes, you are correct. 
---
Not a ban code? Then why a lot of people cant login and any people can?  I try to login from other pc at other internet connection and it is same.
---
Yeah you can do this. Use a container.
---
that is maxed out sneak attack perk and mister sandman added together
---
I just happened to be in the shopping area inside the White Springs hotel and saw a pair on a counter. I'm sure you can also buy them there. 
---
This should be a feature.  It was easily done in indie games like Subnautica.  Any plant you need in game can be collected in the wild then planted in growbeds at your base.
---
If nothing's there, look at your map, it might be the 'find the source of the horde' variation, the more tedious one, and you'll have to go to the three or four search areas. I don't bother with those and will only finish the ones where you'll immediately confront the horde and its boss. A legendary rat horde boss dropped a three-star explosive .44 pistol in my lap last night, albeit only level 15. ;-)
---
thanks for clarification
---
Was given the serum and had intelligence perks maxed out for repairing guns and melee weapons. Now without the fix any weapon perk equipped, I can't fix any of my rifles after ingesting the serum.
---
Socially, children of widows have much, much better life outcomes than children of single parents or addicts.  Humans seem to recover from their family being murdered, become productive members of society, much more easily than they recover fom the effects of sexual promiscuity and drug addiction. 
---
I prefer night vision anyway, so I don't give away my location to enemies. 
---
It happened in the last update I think. I heard it can go away anytime. Others reported on another thread, call 4:8:4000 or something, that players were able to log on after 24 hours and some longer. But I'm not entirely sure but I do know from a fa t that's not a banned code. 1 of my accounts was banned and that's not the code I got.
---
PC: 62 Stealth Sniper, 59 VATS Shotgunner, 24 Tanky Fist Brawler
---
PS4: 61 VATS Pistol, 15 Heavy Gunner (going to be)
---
XBOX: 32 PA Two Handed Melee
---
In 76 int doesn‚Äôt count for XP gain , only consumables that state such buff ( cranberry juice , wise mothman , canned meat stew,well rested) and I might be missing some more 
---
There are quite a few posts about this but the basic consensus is that they're world / event spawns now, primarily in the Savage Divide. So, Uranium Fever, Watoga area etc. Anyspot that spawns plans might have them. But they're extremely rare (more rare than Marine armor plans).
---
Server-hopping doesn't work for world objects. After you pick up an object, there seems to be a cooldown of over 24 hours before you're able to see that object again on *any* server (other people are able to see it and pick it up). World objects are also public, so if an object was already picked up recently by someone else on a specific server, you'll need to wait for it to respawn on that server.
---
It‚Äôs a nightmare but I have been able to make almost anything I can dream of :) 
---
I have 110 requisitions who wants this to become a reality!  
---
Yes!
---
I use 50 cal, for my suppressor machine gun , great to burn 1000 rounds tagging as many enemies as possible 
---
I see this a lot at Watoga with the random 0 star legendaries that pop up occasionally.  Sometimes it seems like pathing issues, but I've seen then just walk away when there was a solid path to me (like, ~20' away on flat ground).
---
Haven't noticed it with starred mobs, or other locations than Watoga that I've run across, but it definitely happens there.
---
https://youtu.be/nqbeCjqX2ww
---
As long as you don't ask your followers to buy books about your made up cult with real money.
---
Hazmat suit hahahaha
---
I'm pretty sure that if you stick something in any container, it persists longer than if you dropped it on the floor in a bag. Those items are gone forever if you log out. 
---
Brilliant we do the same . Good on you üòÅ
---
Join the event directly from the map, don't fast travel close to the event or walk to the event. Has worked everytime for me. 
---
Correct but say I go to a location that has 10 world items, someone else has already picked up 7 and I pick up 3, when I hop the other 7 will be available to me. If they are truly static items and I‚Äôm the first one there. 
---
Keep that handy.
---
Thank you!!! I wonder why they work like that, though. Especially when the others work just fine. Isn't the MK3 just a longer-lasting Stealth Boy?
---
Ha lol I literally did that last night, I‚Äôm level 30 and someone dropped a nuke on fissure prime and I was like fuck it I‚Äôm going. 
---
On goes the hazmat suit and me and my gauntlet head into the nuke zone only for a level 153 Thor looking mother fucker to yell ‚Äúwhat the fuck are you even doing here? Go home before u die!‚Äù
---
Nope I run straight to the bunker out of vault 76 to trigger that quest.
---
Don't forget far cry new dawn just dropped. In playing this at the same time 
---
Ps4. I can't log in, on other users, can log in fine 
---
Yep. It‚Äôs upstairs under the table on the second floor 
---
&gt; *I'm not saying the games is bad, in fact, I'm completely confident that many people are having a blast playing it.*  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;*However, the OP does seem like a corporate shill.*
---
As I said above. 
---
On the same note, PR companies do approach older users and maintain/buy older accounts, but it's just harder to tell.
---
Yeah probably this. But god damn, so much of my camp looks like garbage cause I don't have enough budget to light it properly
---
Yeah I go to nuke zone and tell the level 150 to get a job I'll die if I want.
---
You sure? Without Unyielding 91 xp for Whitesprings ghouls, 189 after Unyielding
---
Thanks for this. I've been looking for additional locations for large quantities of Canned Dog Food to cycle through, due to the personal cooldown for picking up world objects seeming to be over 24 hours.
---
There are also 7 Canned Dog Food in the trailers and buildings outside Blackwater Mine; and 6 Canned Dog Food (3 outside, 3 inside) at Slocum's Joe beside Super Duper Mart at Watoga Shopping Plaza.
---
I sacrificed my reading comprehension perk for slower thirst accumulation.
---
I think another character came to help him but he didn't get her tag
---
Add me! GT is Manager0047
---
Thanks man, jumping on now!
---
Oh really, you missed a trick with Fallout 4 camp building then, It's so restrictive in 76 compared to 4, I had a lot of fun with building on 4, huge castle build with about 20 power armour sets on display lol
---
I claim workshops all the time and in my 500+ hours I can count the number of times I've had to defend them from someone else on one hand. And those times were mostly at the munitions factory. If you clear the workshop of enemies first, you're rewarded with caps and those caps often make the cost of claiming the workshop negligible. Additionally, each workshop comes with a "budget" of materials that you use for building extractors, turrets, etc. As long as you stay within that budget, you won't have to use any of your personal materials to build.  If you are low level, I suggest taking over the Charleston landfill. There's a water extractor there, which you can hook up a generator to, and it churns out 5 purified waters every five minutes or so. Collect them regularly and once you have quite a few go to either Charleston Station or Charleston Fire Department to sell them to a vendor. If you go to the station, swing by Poseidon along the way. There are at last 3 caps stashes there (that I know of) and you will usually find a Grafton Monster in the dry river bed;  when he'd dead you can usually loot about 20 caps from his body as well.
---
It's not really a grind to collect the code pieces. With the surveillance terminal you can go get all 8 in a couple hours max. Plus you get 250xp each time.
---
Someone pointed out that it's an old article that merely seemed related. Sorry for the false hope.
---
And that is from the BETA. 
---
Lmao, I do the same, don‚Äôt worry 
---
I'm testing it out right now. Its giving me weird results. I'll get back to you if I'm trading
---
It's just the current gameplay mode.  They said nothing special about it, just as you are playing now.
---
u/ladydevann 
---
Man you better drop those. You are lucky you survived
---
Don't leave us in suspense!  Which mode did you choose?
---
I was logged in a couple hours ago
---
They could be "suspending account" with high number of tagged items 
---
*Woah!* It's your **7th Cakeday** morphijuana! ^(hug)
---
Until the next patch removes them, not sure though
---
Ty for the feedback...plan to hit F/Kn and all my treasure maps this evening and see if I can duplicate.   Had zero luck server/hop farming the train car or any of the other plan span zones, as well as the safes at the flooded yard (basically all I did in-game yesterday)
---
Bahahah the downvotes. The song can clearly be interpreted as a reference to cannibalism, a common theme in the fallout games (moreso before the series was neutered by Bethesda). Many of the songs in the fallout universe have that same double entendre referencing the murder or lawlessness of the post-apoc world: "keep knocking but you cant come in," "I didn't know the gun was loaded," "I don't want to set the world on fire," etc. That's just off the top of my head. Y'all can't hear that?
---
In 76 the only song they did a decent job (maybe unintendedly) of living up to the old series music choices was 16 Tons because of the heavy suggestion of abuse towards workers by labor bosses (I owe my soul to the company store, another day older and deeper in debt). That fits nicely in the 76 story about people being replaced by robots by big mining corporations and left to suffer poverty with no options for work.
---
So yes, the song OP is asking about is a reference to sex but that's not the only reason it was placed in the series.

The thirty minutes I could stomach being on the game yesterday before growing violently ill with boredom was destroying someone's base with 7 missile turrets on top of it just shaking the world at white springs . Subsequently when he tried repeatedly repairing it I continued to destroy it, and him. I now have a 280 cap bounty on my head. Worth it.
---
Welcome to the boat, they are running automated system which track items movement and crafting. So, if you will craft 100k items, ammo for example an then transfer them to an alt on the same character in will be banned. Moreover, this tracked in 30 day timeline, so that's mean, Bethesda limiting you to have more than 100k item in a month, including ammo, aid, gear, not sure if junk items counted.
---
Thank you Bethesda, to allow you to have such a big amount of items. 
---
One of my mule accounts has been hit by this.
---
Considering that is my oldest mule, every toon is a dump and that one of them is way way above the recently imposed weight limit I wouldn't be surprised if it has raised a few automated digital eyebrows. 
---
Okay this is how the system works. You cheat, you get banned. Simple
---
Doesn‚Äôt flux weight a pound each ? Meaning your character probably was way holding more then it should 
---
They should put in a 30 second timer on log out.
---
The game PvP mode is a bit of a lackluster for many, but both hunter hunted and workshop claim events open up PvP for those involved. Also if you wanna Duke it out you can always fire on some players and see if they fire back. That way you both can engage in PvP.
---
Other then that pve is ok for as long as you have quests to finish or session events to run. After that gets pretty boring. But I still enjoy the game nonetheless. Just have to find something to actually do like screw or spring gathering runs otherwise you'll find yourself running to the quit button a lot.
---
Oh ain't that a nuke to the head 
---
That's where I remembered your name from, you were the one with the serum vending business, right? It was so heart-breaking to read your post back then! Glad to hear that at least that bug got sorted out.
---
I didn't get an email, I got the error code. I then submitted a ticket and was told to purchase the game because the beta had ended, after I got that message I messaged them back and about two hours later they told me my account had been "suspended until they patch duplicating" for "having acquired 100k of one or more rare items." I did not get an initial email, nor have I acquired 100k of one or more rare items. 
---
I am currently waiting on a detailed item list so I can compare it to what I remember from my inventory.
---
Almost 100 % positive , given the online nature of the game wouldn‚Äôt make ‚Äúsense‚Äù characters with 15 int would then level ‚Äúfaster‚Äù then a savant idiot.
---
Added =-)
---
That article is from November 2018 and related to the Beta.
---
Yep, any form of multiplayer that makes you compete for resources just makes this game worse
---
When I started playing I set up a camp &amp; turrets here because the ghouls were overpowering me &amp; my bf. No other players were nearby so it wasn‚Äôt a problem at the time. Now we‚Äôve been playing for a while we understand more about the game &amp; know not to put turrets up here when we return.
---
Is it just low level people placing camps here? I‚Äôve not seen any higher level players doing it, so I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs just because they don‚Äôt know much about the game &amp; didn‚Äôt realise it was a problem to put their base &amp; turrets here. 
---
If you‚Äôre low level &amp; getting attacked by some of the big boys in whitesprings it‚Äôs daunting &amp; you‚Äôll want to protect yourself, but this game takes some time to learn - especially if you don‚Äôt follow Fallout forums &amp; stuff (because you won‚Äôt see people complaining/offering advice).
---
If someone doesn‚Äôt reply when you talk to them, maybe they just can‚Äôt hear you, &amp; if you destroy their base they‚Äôll think you‚Äôre a griefer. I‚Äôve experienced audio issues where I‚Äôm on PC &amp; haven‚Äôt heard anything random players have said, but I can see the speaker icon.
---
Unless, of course, it‚Äôs a high level player and they know better then of course it‚Äôs more of an issue. Arrogance isn‚Äôt fun to deal with
---
Wtf, so pc players literally have to alter two lines of codes and they can play again? Bethesda done fucked it üòÇ I‚Äôm on xbox so I can‚Äôt do anything 
---
i have my main character and one that i made just to have the absolute opposite of my main in terms of gameplay.
---
my main uses PA, the other doesnt. my main uses heavy weapons, the other unarmed. my main is a herbivore, the other is carnivore. my main is eternally overencumbered, the other mostly isnt. etc
---
I either dump it in a suitcase or drop everything in a paper bag on the Vendors counter so it won't be missed. Usually the suitcase though.    
---
    
---
I dump a lot of crap at Pleasant Valley station 3 or 4 times a day
---
Um, you realize that it's completely possible for someone to be in their 30-40s and still played Diablo 2 when it came out, right? And the average life expectancy for people is in the 70s now. So it's really not improbably for someone to be here in their 50-60s. And with some of the advances we're currently making in medicine, living to your 70-80s isn't what I'd call a "super slim" possibility.

Way to be a pessimist, bro.

Screw dog meat:-P Imo the best food is Ionized Meat. It does not spoil and drop from mobs in nuked zones by large quantity - basically, one run will stock you up for 1-2 weeks of gaming.
---
With Carnivore mutation, it satisfies 40% hunger, no disease chance and with Lead Belly rank 3 also no radiation:-)
---
Still needed, and I have Stimpacks for days.

Just 2, my main and my raider. Thanks for Xfering that trapper arm over last night fam.
---
My bad just trying to help
---
I agree on all points.  I may have something to help out with #1 and the support beam stairs though.  I just noticed it last night when screwing around with fixing my CAMP.  Now it worked for me but maybe it won‚Äôt for you because well you know there one or two glitches in this game.
---
I used to think the same thing, that I had to delete all the walls around the stairs to remove them but it turns out that what is happening is that the game wouldn‚Äôt let me delete the stairs because then I would have no way to access my second floor.  So I just built a second set of stand alone metal stairs on the out side of my base that were attached to my second floor balcony and the game registers it as having access to the second floor.  I was then able to delete the internal metal beam stairs at will without deleting any walls.
---
It is still dumb that it works this way but the games logic doesn‚Äôt like that if you delete your only stairs to the second floor you can‚Äôt get up there.  Just a reimport second set and it may let you easily delete the big set.
---
Hope it works for you.
---
No worries, I appreciate the help, just letting you know that‚Äôs all.
---

Didn‚Äôt realise that was for when it happened during the beta, it‚Äôs all good man appreciate it anyways!
---
It's an old article but could still work in theory
---
It's cool how he placed a "Welcome Home" outdoor to comfort himself when coming from a long journey/scavenging. 
---
Lol, yes, but hard to say if it is the Excavator bonus in itself that's boosted, or if it is just the sum of the marsupial carry weight bonus and the various strength boni being boosted all adding up.
---
Yeah I wouldn‚Äôt watch a video of somebody crying or ranting something for longer then 0.01 seconds 
---
Phew, I know, already dropped them. Sorry to the the guy that will pick them up and will get false flagged.
---
One.  Level 97. Once I hit 100 I'll make another character as a junk/ammo mule
---
People buy them for 75 caps per if they are fully charged on the pc discord of r/market76

Sorry yanny needs to calm down 
---
Well also a true god roll would have the desired 3rd stat as well. Which only makes it even more rare
---
and excavator
---
If you are on a team with.....strange in numbers? +25% positive mutations if teammates mutated too, and they leave, it will clear the positive aspects of all mutations. If someone could tag bethesdagame...whatever and let them know.
---
Eh I moved it to the white spring station anyway, come survival mode I might move it back 
---
Elaborate on this. Just trying to understand as I seem to be missing a piece of info that you may have.
---
Fo76 should give us player guilds
---
I don't think I will be able to do it until I replace my controller.  The L joystick is being troublesome.
---
Oh it‚Äôs you! How did you know that it was me here ? 
---
Help new players
---
That's a definite fact lol. I am scared for my build. As well as others.
---
I was immensely disappointed when I found out the shoulder lights were non functional. That would have made the set so much cooler. 
---
You just edited the the description to include "Myself Tyr". It was previously "Why is this happening, ive seen nobody talk about it on youtube besides Tyr" which makes it seem like it wasn't yours.
---
I have no problem with people sharing their own videos, time and effort goes into them and sharing is good. It's the sharing links like it's not your own to drum up views that I dislike.
---
And the promoting of exploits and glitches, which is a shitty move.
---
Honestly, I wish they would. I would love to make the New Union an unofficial, official part of Fallout 76.
---
What does the quest say ? Send us a screenshot of the quest screen for this quest
---
We messaged each other on here our gamer tags =)
---
also hope that rife is treating you well!!
---
Okay need education here. First off what is a zl and how much is 19,00
---
Sorry no photos, just video .... adorable you think I have to prove it though, I tell ya what you go stand on the nuke symbol and wait as a big nuke comes in and see for yourself hell you even get an achievement 
---
Maybe one day.
---
Yep, the next one if I remember right, but an upcoming patch doesn't negate the fact that it's been an ongoing complaint with people who don't enjoy PvP. And if there were separate servers for PvP and PvE, it wouldn't have been a thing for PvEers in the first place.
---
You can also snipe/shoot from across the river and the deathclaw shouldn‚Äôt come after you.
---
Thanks
---
I have a character at lvl 140ish, one at lvl 90-something and I created a new character this weekend that's up to lvl 20.
---
The first is a powerarmored heavy gunner, the second is a powerarmored explosive weapons user (think grenades). The third will be my first non-powerarmored character and he will be using shotguns, rifles and melee weapons (the perk choices are still a bit fluent).
---
The past week my daily routine have been to do a vendor and legendary run on either the lvl 140 or the lvl 90 character (about 2 hours) and since the weekend I've done the same and then played the lowbie character.
---
My experience is that the game punishes you for trying too hard. If I spend too much time on one character trying to do a legendary farm route, the mobs will start to suicide once I return to a spot I've previously visited. If I play a character every other day that problem seem to go away. 
---
I think what people ask is what plants have these - I received mine from a verity of plants I collected from the Nuke area - just so its clear, you must collect the plants in the nuke zone. Just easy to collect all plants in the area and then after bring them to your chem workbench and create.
---
Newest radio station hit
---
One can hope that Bethesda will finally listen to us. 
---
Oh yes now I remember haha anyway whenever you need help let me know man I‚Äôm always happy to help out! :) and play with someone fallout 76
---
Yer that is one thing I've done a bit of too.
---
I just received bos shielded plan.
---
Honestly no clue but figured people here might find this useful somehow
---
That‚Äôs interesting! All I ever get is the engineers outfit üòÇ didn‚Äôt know there were other outfits from turning in technical data.

It's been suggested that the tracking system is off. Someone said they obtained this list of items he acquired over 30 days which had stack of millions of things he never even picked up. You'd think someone out there would look at that and go "Hm.. really? That doesn't seem right" but I guess computers don't lie kid!
---
Will do!! I was just leveling up that low level alt last night, but when I play my main and you are on we can team up. I am at the point with that character that I don't have much to do besides events and Legendary hunt.
---
It's Poland zloty. And 19,00 is literally 5 bucks.
---
Sometimes i think bethesda did such shitjob with all the glitches on purpose so it would be fun for some people
---
Actually, no, I don't.
---
The board crafting dup trick only needed crafting over 256 boards, nothing special about that.
---
How would you "[craft]  hundreds of thousands of diluted stimpacks
---
?
---
Wow dude you've put some hours into the game then.
---
Learned something new thanks!
---
I wonder if part of their stability fix was to no longer close instances that were getting empty, it seemed like the game used to kick you off with a server shutting down for maintenance.  Maybe they aren't so aggressive about kicking and consolidating now.
---
I did that edit specifically for your ass lol, hoped you‚Äôd notice that.
---
I‚Äôve never shared anything to give the impression it wasn‚Äôt my own? And even if I did why would that make a difference in any way shape or form. It‚Äôs not like me sharing a video to reddit will generate any more or any less views than an alt account would?
---
I‚Äôll post what I want thanks, I know what brings in views for a growing channel and I‚Äôll continue to do what I enjoy posting, it‚Äôs helpful quick concise content quick and straight to the point, people want to fly like fuckwits? Check out my video on how to do that, people want to level up some other way other than white springs? I got a video for that too lol hows it affect you? Nothing I post damages the server stability or integrity of my self. It‚Äôs like people see the word exploit and freak out before even watching the video üòÇ
---
Agreed, or make it like DayZ where your body stays in the world for 20-30 seconds after you log out.
---
Awesome! Me too I just build up my camp right now and started exploring the far corners of the map, but it would be better with someone on my side. 
---
Yeah we should have our own special bumblebee sound-emotes . 
---
People would start to hate us though.
---
I had indeed one character at may 3k weight (not sure in detail but definetly above 2k and below 4k). But that doesn't involves cheating or some kind... actually I excepted him to be below absolut weight limit within a month. If they ban for a limit they just added in a recent patch I would at least expect some kind of warning.
---
Empty servers are a symptom of something.  Can you guess what it might be?
---
Why would community managers be to blame? People like u/lonevaultwanderer are just regular dudes like you and me that have had the opportunity to make a career out of their passion. If they're not replying, it's not because they don't want to. They've likely been told not to respond to people who have been banned because they can't access any of the data relating to the account, the ban, or the methods used in this ban wave. This is a dev issue if it's an issue. I am surprised u/BethesdaGameStudios_ hasn't made any statements, because they are the ones to blame if there's any blame.
---
i just take out all their turrets so the ghouls wreck their shit. it‚Äôs worth the caps to me. then when they go for the loot i open fire on them so they have to decide to keep dying for 3* wooden armor or abandon it and server hop.
---
Yup.
---
Oh yeah, thank you :'D Well I still can only use this character as storage mule since he crashes on using workbenches... but made a 2nd character which is 109 currently. Well, again it seems I have to wait for fixes...
---
Believe it or not, I‚Äôve come across said armor quite a few times doing ‚ÄúUranium fever‚Äù. Might want to server hop and see what you get. Always down for a new friend!  \m/
---

melee is for noobs who can't aim or people with bad internet, LOL. when i get creamed by a guy with melee who i havn't even hit yet in one -two hits i just laugh at them. i seriously feel bad for the type of gamer it takes to use a ZERO skill build.... i'm seriously hoping for a melee balancing update because as you have quite clearly stated, a gun should easily be more potent than a knife. a melee build should have to resort to stealth to succeed, not a ranged build as it is now. i hit a guy with a two shot mini nuke with all damage buffs possible and it still doesn't one shot them with a bounty, even with two nukes as apposed to a melee two hitting me without even entering pvp status with them.
---
Is this the one everyone has then?  I never see anyone sporting it much.

As well as charming Scorched, I use mine to do a little Benny Hill style chasing after folks fresh from v76.

First you get bunch of duped stimpacks and purified water. Lots and Lots of them tens of thousands or even more. Then you spam crafting for hours and hours.

You got it, boss. Thanks!

The thing he is referring to is an exp exploit which was posted on youtube. It required having thousands of water, stimpack and a macro so you could walk away as you gain levels over time. I've never done this personally, but I was under the impression they had patched it out.
---
Hey Jersey I managed to spot you a little while back with some assumed colleagues of yours you guys were at what seemed like a restaurant in game could you maybe show us some maybe screenshots of that place in an upcoming video me and my friends really enjoyed the visuals of that place. By the way let the creator know the restaurant looks awesome!!!

TSE nerf happened and the game became a slog but hey at least its "balanced" now and people can't complain that people are 1 shotting mobs ( which is pretty stupid in any game with character progression because as yo uget better gear you will start 1 shotting weaker mobs ) 
---
TSE nerf killed the game for me and many but everyone likes to pretend that it was deserved........not
---
 Those are both primary affixes. This link should help to see what is possible.

I've been visiting them in their home with my bathrobe, sea-captain hat and a pair of pilot-glasses.
---
Just staring them down for way to long. 
---
Kinda works everytime.
---
I kill my own, assholes are everywhere so I ensure they don‚Äôt nuke a legendary before I get to hit it. And I‚Äôm noting that even low dmg Tesla coil does enough to give credit, so again either they didn‚Äôt do any dmg or they didn‚Äôt let the game catch up to show their loot.
---
Carrion player, nope I stand and face tank so everyone gets to get their hits in. I could just be an asshole who drags everything off to kill solo.
---
&gt; Once Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, a fluttering butterfly. What fun he had, doing as he pleased! He did not know he was Zhou. Suddenly he woke up and found himself to be Zhou. He did not know whether Zhou had dreamed he was a butterfly or a butterfly had dreamed he was Zhou. Between Zhou and the butterfly there must be some distinction. This is what is meant by the transformation of things.
---
TSE nerf was the dumbest shit ever,but hey at least the reddit crybabies are happy  and its now balanced 
---
i wonder where the TSE haters are now lol
---
Yeah, I played diablo 2 when I was 15, and play fallout 76 at the ripe age of 35. I‚Äôve played with a few players that are 50-60. It‚Äôs not incredibly rare 
---
I loved this game once........
---
Game is dead props bethesda.
---
I had a low level parked at Whitesprings with no hazmat suit. When I loaded and saw that it was Nukesprings, I sprinted into the resort. As soon as I appeared in there, I died.
---
People are hesitant because the tse gauss has been duped a lot  
---
This game would be so much better as a single player, offline game.
---
They did before doing the so called ban wave , a week before they said they had implemented a new weight restriction ( global weight 1500) and flagged all those accounts as red flags and so and forth
---
TSE and whitesprings nerfs killed the game for many including me
---
whitesprings nerf means that leveling alts is a slog and boring af
---
TSE nerf means the game is craftammo 76 now with bulletsponges
---
but hey at least redditors can no longer complain that people are 1 shotting mobs,or that TSE is op and that the game is balanced now ,i wonder where the tse haters are now 
---
from my playthrough, the story peaks at two places simultaneously. The nuke launch is the penultimate quest in the enclave line. in the story, you're figuring out how to launch nukes for the enclave. beyond that, (spoilers for brotherhood ahead) you discover that the brotherhood have labeled the scorched presence as an extinction event. while nuking shit is what got us here in the first place, you find out in the final brotherhood quest to find Taggerdy that it is the only course of action. the next step is to nuke the queen in an effort to stop the threat.
---
and that's it for the main storyline... you nuke the queen, but nothing happens. it just keeps coming back like nothing, nobody makes a comment on the effect you had (if any) or what's next. i enjoyed the story up until this point. imo the first major content addition should basically be a sequel to what we're doing now, where we get put into a server where the map and environment have been affected by our actions in part one. i just really don't see this game being alive years down the line, with all of us running around the exact same map, with no resolution to the scorched/SBQ/overall story. im not even 100% sure what happened to the overseer, and due to the poor guidance of the quests (my biggest issue with the main questline. you can kind of jump into it at certain parts, and there aren't really explanations for things. a great majority of the players don't pay attention to what they are doing or why bc it's cryptic), im not sure if that's how it's supposed to be, or if i even heard her "last tape." i would assume that she branched off from the main mission into "Personal Matters," which is a great questline imo, do it if you haven't, but from what i gathered, she never says "im going ___." and we don't find her corpse. 
---
take your time, theres no rush. definitely do it, but don't run through like you're running out of time. we're getting info on future content by the end of the month. I recommend also taking the time to do side and daily quests and events. most don't give great rewards, but if you're playing the game for the experience, it's worth it. there are definitely some hidden gems out there. I also recommend treasure maps if you're looking for other things to do. I've also been getting into challenges, though a good handful of them are bugged, including some daily or weekly ones.
---
Paper bag despawn when no one around. Container persist as long as the server. I believe that‚Äôs how it works unless it‚Äôs not. 
---
Do both of you get the same error? I wonder if you could get another player to enter ahead of you,and you can see if you can follow them in (tend to play solo so not sure if that's even possible or not) and may be that might force the quest to move forward?
---
People have been saying stealth has been kind of broken since the last patch. But it used to work well to reset your sneak from danger to caution.
---
I checked the seventysixmenu.swf and both are actually there, clearly, we just need to wait for Beth to update it for when Survival beta comes out

I mean, all TSE have been duped a lot, I trade my very first tse shotgun for it, but I regret it because I notice that I make more damage and my accuracy is better with a handmade

Last I did that I respawned with a bounty, but give it a whirl why not?
---
I pretty much live in my power armor. I don't even carry normal armor with me. But I take my Nuka T51b frame and Excavator with me wherever I go. Excavator for when I'm out junking and exploring, T51b for "serious" fights like nuke zones. I spend more time in my Excavator by far.

OH That's really helpful omg, thanks a lot!

&gt;  It required having thousands of water, stimpack and a macro so you could walk away as you gain levels over time.
---
Ah, ok, that makes sense.  So it's a way of turning duped items (stimpacks, water) into exp.
---
Haha
---
Free to play game soon

Yea you wont have AA with a furious, bloodied or TS. You can have explosive with all of those since explosive is a major.

I want the Excavator in 110% red white and blue ‚ÄòMurica paint.

Melee is for noobs or cheesy no skill gamers who want an easy build. i just laugh at them because the level of skill it takes to play it is non existent, lol. but it does seriously need a balancing update.  there is no way in hell i should be able to get one or two hit into the dirt by a melee build, while they survive my two shot mininuke with all the damage modifiers possible atm, oh and the guy also has a bounty, lol. if you get hit directly by a nuke it should kill instantly, but it doesn't even do any rad damage which....wtf?
---
The principal game mechanic of FO76 is *inventory management* using primitive inventory management tools.   Perk cards are just one form of inventory that‚Äôs meant to be fun to manage, so the answer is ‚Äúprobably not‚Äù.  
---
Are you not having fun swapping perk cards in and out?   Try it while you‚Äôre eating, drinking, running or being killed.   Even though I hate it, it might work better for you.  
---
A few hundred?  
---
The Responder Bot in Grafton sells them as well. Not the one at the rail road station. The one at the building in town. 
---
A lot of the common ones have been mentioned already, but here are the ones odd the top of my head:
---
Stations - Suitcases, registers (especially Watoga after SBQ is dead)
---
Overseer‚Äôs cache
---
Whitesprings - Ice box outside of the Golf Club, register at Artisan‚Äôs Corner, trash cans near the resort doors, paper bags everywhere
---
/r/Market76 
---
Ah.  Once again I am amazed by the amount of effort people will put into *not playing the game*.  Thanks for the enlightenment.
---
Don't you need the "congressional card" or something? 
---
Put it in your stash, log out, take it out. Not sure if the stash part is needed since I remember putting some in my stash and taking it out one day and the quest came up
---
Glad you're enjoying it.  Oh and don't worry, you'll notice glitches soon enough.
---
If you di the queen a couple hundreds times you'll get more fluxes than you can store on a mule. So I always converted those into serums. I used the perk Super Duper too. May Bethesda counts using that perk as duping, lmao

If you try to create a blueprint you are limited.  Just found it created a bigger blueprint as you described, but if I try to scrap it so I can build another base...it forces me to delete that blueprint.

On the ones where you are supposed to have to check up to four areas I've noticed that lately there have been five areas to check despite the 1/4 - 4/4 update you get, I. e., check the map for an extra area. 
---
Literally?
---
Exactly, TSE have been duped a lot and you want to trade it for something arguably better AND hasn't been duped into oblivion. You cant trade a penny for a dollar

This game and it's flaws don't impact my view of the other games in the slightest. It's a spin-off. A side story that doesn't impact the other stories in any way. New Vegas is the same deal, despite the opposite reception it received.
---
No one views the Legend of Zelda series poorly because the CD-i games were hot garbage.
---
At this point, I'm satisfied with my experience. I've payed way more for games I've played way less. But then again, I enjoyed No Man's Sky before it received all those beefy content updates. They ABSOLUTELY should keep fixing the game, especially if they want people to play future content.

If you're looking for a large source of Firecaps two great locations are by the Monorail in a wheelbarrow near the cliff to the west, and the bottom floor of the Vault Tec Agriculture building near Flatwoods. Both have 5+ firecaps. Brain Fungus is often found in caves. Carrot Flowers are all over the place in the savage Divide.
---
True, the community could make a better game.
---
Is this clan/guild 18+? 
---
It's been such a slow process to fix a lot of the issues, sometimes it's hard to remember how much worse it was. There are still problems, but it is so much better! Glad you're enjoying it!

Mine is on the fairway of hole 3.  Right by the little house with the Nuka Cola machine.

I purposely wanted to be as far from  the resort as possible, but still have the flat, green lawn.

That would be so amazing

I haven't had this happen yet.  I'm on PS4 though.  I logged on fopr the first time in a couple weeks aroung 5:00am on Sunday.  Server was full.  I kind of wish I could get an empty server.  I only have 5 Charisma for Lone Wanderer and fast travel discount.
---
It might be a "Penny" but it still pack a punch, except is not my type of weapon, and you really think AA weren't duped? not as much as tse but still duped
---
That's exactly why we won't have the scrubbers anytime soon, because everything else would be useless. 
---
YES! I want a fire cap, bloodleaf, snaptail farm for disease cures!! 
---
‚ÄúInventory management‚Äù is a good phrase there. However I do find it annoying to do a quick perk swap for unlocking a safe. I don‚Äôt feel like it would have much of an effect on game play though. I simply swap the perks, loot the safe and swap back and continue on my way. Maybe more of a quality of life. 
---
Oh no, I'm on PS4
---
A level 320ish that‚Äôs melee+pistols using a bloodied build. A level 140 that‚Äôs a bloodied rifle build. Then a level 110 that‚Äôs a melee PvP build. I‚Äôm probably going to make another for a heavy weapons build for PvP.

I've found quite a few Marine Armor plans to the west of Watoga in the NAR Repair Yard. Found Marine Tactical/Wetsuit/Armor.

Also Watoga has some random spawns of mods for T-60 and Marine Armor on top of the buildings occasionally.

Wish I would've seen this yesterday 
---
No, but once I get more members I can create a section for those who are 18+. Essentially a separate group but the same 
---
You could probably Google it, I'm sure it's 5 American dollars in exchange.
---
My point is that you are going to have a hard time trading one of the most commonly duped items that most traders have already, for one that is harder to find (duped less). 
---
When you log in, stand still for a few sec, until the shadows and trees start moving, then the pipboy will work
---
They rest of the perks can stay as inventory management, they can even make lock picking/hacking harder, but please stop making me swap perk cards every time I find a locked object. 
---
I imagine this is why I find so many bags full of junk at spawn points in white springs. I always take them and have zero regrets

i‚Äòm having this issue since yesterday and i did everything to make it work but nope nothing.. i hope there‚Äòs gonna be a solution as soon as possible! 
---
They should have a minimum Stat requirement. Like for Lockpick 1, you need 3 perception for it to valued at 0, Lockpick 2 you'd need 6 perception for it to be valued at 0, and Lockpick 3 you'd need 9 perception for it to be valued at 0. The same with Hacker. Maybe 1 card would work like this for each stat group.
---
Tell them to sent You a list of items. 
---
Here is my topic - ofcorse downvoted for asking why common ammo is on the list. mabe thats the problem??

---
I use flatwoods too. Easily accessible by all level players. 
---
I also started the game late and I also love it!
---
I'm just playing it in 'explore mode' like I play Fallout 3/4 and I really love the world building that Bethesda put together here.  I'm not really missing the lack of 'human NPCs' either.  I honestly don't understand the complaints at all.  Remember...this is Reddit...people will complain about anything and everything.  Reddit is not representative at all of the actual player base. 
---
As with most online games, I see many discussions about farming runs, optimizing vendor runs, beating the game, etc...  Sorry, but that stuff just isn't for me.   I'll just explore the world until I've had my fill and then I'll move onto another game.  And then come back to FO76 for another go at some point in the future.   However, due to the online nature of it, I do worry a bit about the long term viability of the game.   I'm not so sure we will be able to come back to it years down the road like we can with Fallout 3/4, Fallout NV, Skyrim, and the other Bethesda games.    
---
Same haven't played since the 24th of jan, logged in today after reading about this and yup got the message.
---
Thirst does seem slightly faster since the last patch, but it's not been a problem.  You should get thirsty more often than hungry.  I just pack an additional couple of Boiled Water before I head out.
---
Yes you're right, but I still gonna try because is useless to me sadly
---
Great comment, and it really highlights the issues of the PvP system to the average player. 
---
Some of the more smug and condescending comments I‚Äôve received hinge upon all this obscure, arcane knowledge they just assume everyone should know because of how much time they‚Äôve spent reading about, chatting about and playing the game. What they fail to realize is the game gives zero information on much of this, and much of it goes against plain logic or claims Bethesda made pre-release. 
---
I‚Äôve never posted a complaint about the game, have taken the bugs and minor disappointments without much aggravation. I know what to expect from Bethesda by now in those departments. But the PvP of this game is really an abject failure, and it keeps getting worse as time goes on. At the very least, pacifist mode needs to *work* and needs to be extended to camps as well. 
---
above 20? no.
---
under 20? yes.
---
"**\[ADDED\] Rad Worms now increase all Player Effects by 50%, including weapon damage.**
---
* **STATUS:** This is planned to be addressed in Patch 6."
---
Please Don't "Address" this, I love my little Rad Worms.
---
Did it have a giant wall set up beside the house? If so, I may be your guy. I always do that and leave the server hoping people find it 
---
My friend.... Get the "Can Do!" Perk. Once you have rank 3 Can Do, all it takes is 1 vsit to whitesprings, search all the trash cans. You'll have more than enough dog foos and canned goods that don't spoil.
---
I'm on ps4 or I would help, but have you tried tagging one deathclaw at a time and running back up the stairs? They won't follow you up there, might take longer but maybe easier.
---
It‚Äôs almost like fallout belongs in a single player setting.
---
I took it to belching Betty thinking this was true. It isn‚Äôt 
---
Are people just trying actual troubleshooting? It sounds like the inconsistencies of a network error if it‚Äôs not some intention map ban wave.
---
Reset your routers. Delete your network setup and reconnect it.
---
Idk 
---
There‚Äôs a 100% chance you learn to craft marine helmets when you scrap them. Just FYI
---
Thank you 
---
They're on the menu after you log on to a server. So like for PS4, option then left bumper, select Challenges. 
---
I just wish they would make the stupid lockpick animation faster. Oh, I broke a bobby pin? Let's wait 3-4 seconds for the bobby pin to "break", then for the lock to spin back, then for a new bobby pin to appear. Every time.
---
&gt; I joined late, I guess after all the glitches
---
they did a decent job of patching the game, at least they got rid of all the exploits, however, there are still plenty of glitches, even some the patch notes say are fixed
---
When people are constantly circumventing the system for exploits, that is what I would consider a failure. The good news is as soon as they admit that, they can begin to give an overhaul. 
---
I would rather be able to set up multiple profiles with our perk cards. Just a one click toggle would be great. 
---
One profile for fighting
---
One for farming
---
One for crafting
---
The list could go on depending on how many profiles are allowed. 
---
They‚Äôre not, they‚Äôre just finicky
---
Another new account claiming to have been banned unfairly. Seems legit. 
---
Nice job.
---
I once had a signal repeater or something of a similar name drop on the ground. It was part of the quest after finishing the rose quest line. 
---
Anyways, I was able to go back to where the quest finished and re pick up the signal repeater even though I didn't have the quest anymore. 
---
Could you try to go back to Sam's bunker in the mire and interact with the photo again? Maybe it will pop back into your inventory.
---
What? Doing the main quest at morgantown airport.
---
600 play hours lvl 285 is not legit ? my friend im playing with is several gaming hours and have lvl 330 Ticket NR.   190217-001902  
---
Artillery takes time to level a camp and each time they shoot you get 10 caps. You can get 300 caps bounty easily from just a small camp so good luck with your "community service" while I collect your 300 cap bounty and the guy whose base you leveled can rebuild it for 40caps if he moves it 1 inch or repair the turrets that cost oil steel and gears aka nothing.
---
You‚Äôve been banned.  
---
I have done this a few times, in stages.
---
First, I will take out just the turrets. If they come back and repair, I add to the damage by taking out the Turrets and a wall or 2.  If they repair, I move on to turrets, a few walls, and a crafting bench or 2. If they don't get the hint, then its orbital strikes until the entire place is decimated.
---
Also, I have only done this when there were actual low level players trying to level there. They were up on the wall by the pool and were baiting them out to try and kill them.
---
The day you can buy anything non cosmetic from the Atom Shop will be the day the game truly dies. I love the game. I'm not drinking the hater-aide. But if they walk back on the "cosmetic only" thing... Lots of people will nope out. 
---
No Fucking bann fucking nothing Just account is not reachable because of Bethesda is not even proper to programm the Account managing
---
For those you're better off getting the Pharma Farma perk, I have it and 80% of the time I get a disease cure by "searching" a medkit / doctor's bag.  I have about 20 of them on me at all times because of it!
---
I think this would be great.. break the monotony of the armor.. I mean, why can we slap paint on other armors, but not the excavator? 
---
On PC, I think my most negative experience so far has been waving at someone and them ignoring me and running away. I've had nothing but positive experiences with other players.
---
Just last night a high level player came along to help in a workshop defend quest. He accidentally tagged me in the fracas, and afterwards apologized, and had me kill him to remove the Wanted tag.
---
Maybe PC just has a different demographic of players 
---
Nope Im not Banned ur Morron
---
It means the same thing.
---
Oh yes it did
---
I always log out at my camp or somewhere I know is safe. Sometimes as soon as I log in my camp will have a few enemies so I will back up and hide behind a tree for a few. Just dont touch the pipboy button. I can draw my weapon in a few seconds if I need to and usually by then things are safe. 
---
Interesting. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs all but dead on the web but I love seeing the various places it‚Äôs still used. 
---
The one thing that gets me is that the Whitespring bunker has a massive vault front door, a medium vault door into the resort, and a dinky-ass, almost totally exposed service entrance. 
---
Yeah I have the Green Thumb perk and I now have a little route that I follow in the Forest area by the Slocum's Joe area, I gather around 20-30 each run including what I find in the Agriculture building
---
We wouldn't be here if it wasn't. 
---
no
---
Elder paint is a dev item.
---
it takes zero skill to use melee, lol. it's almost an exploit and you should be ashamed to even admit that you use it. i can one shot a lvl 65 ghoul with a basic super sledge and ZERO buffs or perks and 11 strength. so naturally i just assume melee players are twelve and don't have any self respect yet, LOL.
---
I believe you can buy mods for those in the enclave military vendor. 
---
That would be a good solution considering it would be hard for the game to tell when to ‚Äúunmagnify‚Äù them (didn‚Äôt consider that when I posted) 
---
Yeah he‚Äôs being obvious about his lying. I don‚Äôt click on videos made by people trying to trick me.
---
the intention was never to hot swap in useful cards only when they are needed, they wanted us to be able to be flexible because of the lack of cards in the early game and so we can experiment with different builds, being able to hot swap useful cards was never the intention
---
I'm still looking for that one, and the BOS Arms Plan.
---
I'll pay fair prices if you want to trade, look at some of my other posts, I have lots of good Trade items.
---
Cool clan idea
---
Well, seems that i have to check the market then
---
I've not mass crafted or even been online for the last month. I've never mass crafted in that way either. And my friends that are banned have not done that either. I've most likely been flagged for ammo. And there's even a screenshot of one of the lists they have sent out to people on the official forums showing "mass" amounts of ammo.
---
Classical Radio is amazingly well curated too. 
---
15 star legendary protest sign
---
Giving people abuse who are telling u what ur original code was is super productive, im a moron ? üòÅ well i guess this moron is playing fallout because u certainly aint üòò 
---
Something needs to be done. It's silly to have to switch cards only to have to switch again after a lock is picked, or a computer is hacked.
---
I have all three perk cards and never swap them out anymore. I just don't want to bother and if I had it to do over again I wouldn't waste the perk points for them. It's just an annoying hassle that slows me down.
---
You mean inside or outside the mine? 
---
I went there right now to test it and it protects at least when outside, with the notification "Your gear has protected you from airborne disease". Inside I don't even need protection at all it seems.
---
Swearing and acting like an arrogant prick isn't going to help 
---
This is one of those posts that I wish that I upvote over and over again over again! 
---
Hey how can you keep crafting Radshield? 
---
I got the message I was exposed to black lung or sludge lung or whatever. I ran up there with the veil and promptly switched to a gas mask 
---
Frankly, I just skip safes now, they never have anything worth my time.
---
Marine deep pocketed hardened.  I was gonna go scout but found it a little harder to mod and the deep pocketed polymer too heavy.  Now that i have the chameleon mutation though i just go for anything weightless deep pocketed.  If need be throw on my pa
---
Defeats the point of the perk cards. It's a pain but it's better than what it used to be, which was what u picked was perm. No flipping in/out. 
---
I have a decent run for the ingredients. So I can crank out 30 in not too long a time. But I'd rather just grow it at my camp. My luck is dedicated to mutations, so it's better for me to craft disease cure. 
---
You'd probably have been dead even if you loaded in after the nuke, as you sit there taking radiation damage as the game takes it's time loading the world. I've loaded into WS to being beat on by invisible enemies. Have to pound stimpaks and sprint away, only to see the ghoul horde appear one by one as the game world finally loads completely. 
---
Let us paint everything.
---
If I find Blue Paint in the wasteland, why can't I slap it on my *Painted* Metal Armor?
---
The Atom Store can still have a market for skins and such.
---
Very nice. I wear this combo too. Love the gloved outfits. 
---
It did swim at me once so I'd be ready to run like hell 
---
Well you are on xbox and I learned it of course. I'd personally think mainly the enclaive shielded might be worth saving.(I have brought a suite myself from trader)
---
Sorry, I forgot to put my sunglasses on.
---
All power armours should be able to be painted.  Theres only a handful in the game. Makes no sense lol
---
I only have the level 1 Pharma Farma, the rest of my luck is for Bloody Mess and Starched Genes as I have begun farming mutations as well.  Having Speed Demon and Marsupial reallllly helps with the gathering of ingredients.  But, is it too much to ask for a small drug farm on some remote mountain top??
---
I have two ideas that would be great for this;
---
* After picking 76 locks, level 1 becomes known &amp; no longer requires a card to be equipped, 760 for level 2, and 7600 for level 3.
---
* Allow us to combine Lock Picking cards, so we only need to swap 1.
---
Yeah shooting anywhere within the vicinity of a mob and having it explode is so riveting in a game where you are supposed to aim at things. Lazy ass TSE crybabies. 
---
Were we not scheduled for Patch 6 today? Maybe servers are down.
---
That would just call for an artillery strike 
---
I‚Äôm level 190 and still haven‚Äôt seen one 
---
So since everyone is now running around with oldies builds, what's the best way to best it?
---
Duh you get an email asking for a poem.
---
Just how many are we talking about here? I carry around 30k with no problem and ban hammer didn't land on me yet. About the screenshots you are talking about, I be seeing something like 22k nuka grapes and stuff. I'm pretty sure that's what got him banned. Why are people focusing on the ammos? I don't get it
---
I have an x01 jetpack for sale ps4 but the price is 3k.  The price of convenience. Respond if interested.  Also have emergency protocols mod x01. 
---
Stealth in this game is underwhelming. I have maxed shotgun perks and enforcer. Pop those behemoths in the knees a couple times - they‚Äôll go down and stay down. Then keep blasting away at its head, eezy peezy. This build sucks against SB‚Äôs though, because they fly pretty high. It‚Äôs amazing against everything else though. 
---
this game is anything but aim based considering VATS exist kek
---
Either the suitcases at Train Stations, or the cash registers next to the robot vendors.
---
Servers don't replace people that leave. If you start on a full server and then everyone except you gets off, you'll be the only one on the server.
---
IF BETHESDA BANN YOUR ACCOUNT U GET AN FUCKING EMAIL I DONT HAVE ANY EMAIL SO I DONT HAVE BANNED ACCOUNT again u are the moron
---
Your spawn point is relative to it. In edit mode, pick up the machine and rotate it, move it, etc. You should change where you spawn in.
---
Your back will always be towards the CAMP machine and you will be a fixed...ish distance from it. This is to give your camp time to spawn in before you turn around. Can't always rotate where you spawn in but you can move it.
---
Try moving it to the edge of the build circle, away where you normally spawn in. If you spawn in on the north side of your CAMP when you spawn in, move the CAMP machine to the far south side of the build circle. I do this and my spawn point is now inside of my main building. 
---
Do be careful though as this does make it possible to spawn inside of things if your base doesn't load in before you do.
---
Probably bit late but shopping baskets (which there's a bunch around the stores in Watoga, north east section) and enamel buckets, which Fort Defiance has a lot of them inside.
---
Heads up folks. I‚Äôm not experiencing this. I‚Äôm not Bethesda, and I can play the game just fine. I just thought I‚Äôd share in case it helps someone out.
---
Fwiw, the IT guy in me says try it, given Bethesda hasn‚Äôt given much guidance. BUT, everyone‚Äôs risk tolerance varies from person to person based on their experience and skill.
---
Good luck.
---
There is one that sits in some water by where my camp was for months üòÇ I only randomly noticed it and it seems to always be there. It never bothered me but I about shit my level 20 self when I noticed it. 
---
What do you mean oldies build? I guess you mean bloodied? What do you mean how to best it? In PvP? or to out-damage it in PvE?
---
Same thing in GTA5. If you block certain ports after you connect to server every player disconnects because it thankfully uses P2P to find users. I can do every mission that makes it annoying with other players just by myself or a friend (whitelist their IP)
---
Appalachian Building Codes are way too strict, it‚Äôs incredibly annoying to have to repeatedly pick up and replace things just to move one wall or floor piece.
---
Thx, i need to increase mine but i prefer putting points in strength and intelligence. 
---
Co-op is awesome, yep.  
---
One spawns just south west of the steel node near (west of) Twin Lakes in a small body of water if you wanna track one down. He will be sleeping hunched over in the water. Level 50. He respawns pretty quick, too. Used to farm him for caps when my camp was over there cause he usually drops 15-20c per encounter. 
---
Thanks 
---
Watoga robots are known for being promiscuous while not using protection, they've brought it on themselves. 
---
I think all of the bright lights are doing it. It will stop you from trading and destroy if dropped for someone else to pick up. Lost a few of them in the group of people I play with.
---
YEAH BUT MUH BUILD BRO.....  
---
MUH BUILD!!!!
---
Wait you can get PA plans from these?
---
A couple of guaranteed hits depending on your AP vs Mindlessly mow down everything forever because explosions.
---
The servers are worldwide. There shouldn‚Äôt be off hours if it is popular enough. 
---
Bans appear to be based on what they gathered information wise from the server maintenance.  If you had 15k Nukas you are good.  If you had 110k of one type of Nuka you are banned now.  If you had for example 9000 grape Nukas and 95,000 Quantom nukas after the maintenance your 9000 grapes should have remained and the 95,000 quantoms were cut down to 1, and your account should still be active.  
---
&gt; Is this game worth getting?
---
for $60?  no.
---
&gt; I was excited for this game but before it came out there was horrible news floating around about how bad it is 
---
it had a horrible launch, the patches have done a decent job, all the exploits are patched, but even if the game launched in the state it's in currently it still wouldn't have been worth $60.
---
&gt; I was originally a h1z1 just survive player and with just survive being canceled i was hoping that this would fill that gap. 
---
no, it doesn't fit that gap, for that specific playstyle I would recommend DayZ
---
&gt; Is this game a loot,raid, and pvp/pve?
---
no, there are no raids and the loot system in this game sucks, the drops are horrible and forget about crafting...
---
&gt; What do players do on this game? 
---
gear up, but the gearing up in this game is fundamentally broken, I touched on it in the last answer but to expand, getting good gear is based on luck, not skill, and crafting requires plans, if you want plans for any end game equipment good luck, for the X-01 PA there is only *one* vendor that sells those plans and it could take hours or days (yes days) of server hopping to get the plan you want.  oh and most of the time the SBQ either has shit loot, an infinite loading symbol, or the queen falls through the map and no one can loot it.
---
&gt; Im a pvp player that also loves the pve 
---
PvE in this game is meh, there are no NPCs save like 2 or 3 interesting bots and the PvP in this game is also broken, badly, I'm not even going to go into it, it's just broken...
---
I tend to skip them because I don‚Äôt feel like swapping perks, but sometimes I just have to know what‚Äôs in there. 
---
I'd probably play if there was a single player option that didn't require additional monthly fees.  Leveling up and exploring the world without a story can still be entertaining.   
---
Uranium only spawns level 40 enemies now, so no chance at higher level loot just as a heads up. 
---
impossible for u to have see TSAA or BAA as they don't exist.
---
VERY rarely apparently
---
Ps4, sorry
---
I played this weekend and saw plenty of players, though less than normal. Saw some poor guy drop a nuke and try to solo the SBQ. More than half the players were under lvl 30. With the recent updates, my guess is that some are waiting for the code dust to settle, lots are starting new characters (low levels), and some are upset that their dups were lost (good riddance). I think it will make for better play and better players. 
---
That said, that little punk the killed me at the nuked golf course by accident, then took all my junk and fled the server... I'm coming for you. I know it was an accident, we were neck deep in glowing ones, wreaking havoc with melee weapons, then the little punk pulls out their explosive shotgun and starts blasting with reckless abandon. I was caught in the cross fire. That's fine, it's part of the game. But then to take my junk and flee the server faster than sailor on payday! Oh, I will find you little guy, then we will have some words. I will help relieve you of that bounty. 
---
I know, but some 3*s are viable even at end game, or just to sell them for caps
---
Alright. Best of luck to you then!
---
The Excavator PA, was designed as a piece of "Construction Equipment", so the Paint Schemes should be limited to something fitting that Lore.
---
I believe that once the Carry weight glitch from logging in while in the Excavator PA is patched, there won't be near as many players still using it.
---
A few more basic colors, like; Fire Engine Red, John Deere Green &amp; New Holland Blue, would be a good addition, but any more than that is not to Lore friendly.
---
You were banned.  Some people got emails, some did not.  Some got replies to support tickets that were generic mention of 100k items, others got emails with the specific amounts and types of items they had.
---
This is hilarous and ingenious. I'd volounteer for your oven anytime 
---
Considering they actually left players with 1 "duped item" after the Purge, instead of removing everything, shows to me they're sympathetic to the playerbase.
---
And they are free,just give them back after you read them
---
When you got into to much trouble you could sneak and enemies would lose you again.
---
Well we do make up two thirds of all players‚Äô
---
Do you want to trade it with x01 stealth boy mod
---
Hang on about 40 minutes and I‚Äôll help you out. You can go ahead and add me on 76 at Nathan_TK. I‚Äôd give you my discord but every time I use it it completely shuts off the game audio. 
---
i dont have any overwieght limit and me and my partner dont have any item in value of 100,000 . u can think im lying but i realy need helpe because my account is clear
---
Deep pocketed with weapon/ammo/FDC weight reduction. I hate being over encumbered. 
---
The placement of lines in the ini seems to matter. If you don't have the proper [Headers] above the line, they don't seem to work.
---
This is literally why I uninstalled until they release the server files.
---
I'll vouch for the significance of the day.
---
It's even a statutory holiday here in Canada. 
---
Its a ban but a lot of people didn't get the email from what people have posted.  They said accounts would be allowed back in after a patch, but not sure if that is the upcoming patch (this week) or anther one.
---
Any news on this? I woke up to find the same error on my mule account. 
---
4:8:2000 Login failed
---
Bumping for visibility. 
---
Ok on a more serious note, I was given a supposed fix as it's not related to the duping, but apparently they shut down the beta servers and some are still setup to connect to it:
---
Go to My Documents.
---
Go to the location of your Fallout 76 files.
---
Select the file Fallout76.ini.
---
Delete the following lines of text:
---
[Bethesda.net]
---
sTitleType = beta
---
Save the updated file.
---
I have found; Treated &amp; Resistant for all Underarmors Protective for BOS &amp; Enclave, but only got Shielded for Enclave, and I haven't gotten any more since the patch.
---
I bought my tse gause for 500 caps
---
Many had more than just 1 of them. Saw pic of a stack of  5 TSE Shotguns with 7 Grognak axes above it, all 3 star so maybe they only went after higher quantities on players? 
---
Assuming that the login errors are just that, errors, people are saying they‚Äôve been banned for having items since Friday with this new error that also say they never duped anything so not sure how sympathetic they‚Äôre being.
---
uh, music today is way worse, including what Kanye 'writes'.
---
Some of the people with the message got ban letters, others that didn't later got support replies saying they were banned.  Same message appeared on previous ban also.  Its a ban message.
---
Well he loves that meat.
---
And I truly thank them for letting us be flexible. I‚Äôve changed builds and experimented with Many different perks. But Lock picking/hacking isn‚Äôt specific to any build so I would think it would be safe to say that it wouldn‚Äôt harm the game if those were somehow permanent. 
---
Yeah, but that one is only LVL 50. The one I tangled with was a LVL 90...
---
You can‚Äôt, they quest drops sorry but two very similar ones can be rewarded by doing forest events and daily quests but the drop rate abysmal.
---
Your best bet it to buy them from other players vie a trading subreddit like bazaar or market. 
---
My boyfriend cannot log in either and I have pictures of his inventory from right after the path as he was at work and wanted me to check to see if anything of his was affected as he does trade weapons and items with his friends. He never had a surplus of any item, so it could not be possible for him to be banned for an amount like that. But, like this guy we have yet to get a response from our ticket or an email either so it's very up in the air right now .
---
Anyone on this thread can add me on here, always looking for people to play with. Lvl 112, sniper build. PSN: Thursatru 
---
Can you say more about those diminishing returns? I just finally tossed points in to max out all these cards and now I‚Äôm questioning that. 
---
That‚Äôs not true, my email says I was banned for 13k black titanium scrap. I don‚Äôt have anything over 100k.
---
I love the artillery. Not very useful, but I found a truck near my camp I can watch explode
---
Eh, there are parts that lack some consistency with the metaphor because hey why not toy around with people listening and you've got to come up with lyrics.
---
I started playing this weekend for first time since the game launched. I ran into another player. I was happy to see him at first. "Oh look. Another survivor out in the wasteland! How cool!" Then decided to be on my way. Then...
---
He started following me. He would shoot at me or run up and try to hit me. I ignored him and went on about my business. He continued to follow me. He even started hitting me and throwing grenades at me while I was at a cooking fire. After about 15 minutes of this, he got bored and left.
---
I was so happy to be alone again after he left.
---
Must be a virus  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_\/¬Ø 
---
Pretty sure the Bos vendor in Watoga has them.
---
Phoenix in Watoga had all the T-51 mod plans.
---
Lol. Dupelicious.
---
I wonder if another player could open the door for you, as long as the laser beams are blue for you.
---
Going in undercover
---
&gt; Lock picking/hacking isn‚Äôt specific to any build 
---
sure they are, lockpick goes with a sneaky type build and hacker goes with a science/intelligence build.  in single player Bethesda games lockpick is necessary because of how many locked containers there are, but in FO76 there are fewer locked containers by far, so it's not as necessary to a build in this game as it was in Skyrim.
---
Phoenix in Watoga has all of the mods for T-45, T-51b, and T-60.
---
I think you are right. They count the ammo too. Look at their wording, the following items are exploit. 
---
Not yet. 
---
I think you are right with the bag.  I had dropped a bag to reduce weight so I could fast travel back to my CAMP and fix stuff.  Approx  10-15 min later, I returned.  My bag was still there but got the never-ending turning wheel.  I waited 5 min watching it turn.  I went into the train station to do some business, returned and still turning wheel.  Gave up on it
---
Thanks. I'm going crazy having no mods at all
---
I just got a nice 3\* drop: lvl 35, executioners, +40% power attack, 15% less damage while blocking
---
If you are on PC you are welcome to have it have it, maybe trade for a cool outfit?
---
If you have a friend to middle man transferring tokens, you can create alts to do the initial quest to get 8 tokens, transfer, delete alts, make new alts, and so forth.
---
Pain in the butt but faster than waiting however long.
---
Happened to me yesterday afternoon, did a full uninstall reinstall, got the same thing this morning. I have a couple thousand rounds of 45. and 5.56 that's the only thing I have that's in the thousands range. This honestly needs a response. The community is already growing less loyal each week.
---
It should be like it was in skyrim. All locks would be pick-able, but having multiple lock picking cards active open up the sweet spot a bit more.
---
It's not a ban code. It's a new bug from the last patch issue. 
---
I usually play in the evening around 7pm until who knows when. Lol. Somewhere between midnight and 4am. I‚Äôm Eastern time.
---
It's a dirty trick some people pull: They invite you to their team and invite you to their camp. Once you get there, there's some sort of trap waiting for you which causes you to die so that they can loot your body. This was one of the cruder, meaner versions of that. 
---
RadX &amp; Diluted, also suppresses mutations, Radshield &amp; Glowing Blood Packs do not.
---
Why not then do Aquaboy. I'm not in water all the time. 
---
And Gunsmith too. Sometimes I swap to melee and I don't need Gunsmith at that moment. 
---
And..
---
And...
---
I get the feeling you are playing the wrong game. You could come up with an argument for every sing perk. The game is about making choices/sacrifices. If you want to pick locks then either keep it equipped 24/7 (sacrifice?) or swap it in/out when needed (choice?).
---
See, this is why you **never** log off at Whitespring or Prime. And I‚Äôm saying this trying to be helpful. You never know if they‚Äôll be an active zone when you join because of how popular they are. 
---
Bag is buggy don‚Äôt use it as items transfer between mules. Sometimes it will fall thru the floor. I always use world containers for that purposes. 
---
Oh, that makes a lot more sense. No I haven't seen that trailer. My one smart ass comment on that is: Boy all these gamers sure are attractive people! I get it though, that's how commercials work.
---
Again it wouldn‚Äôt do anything.
---
I've been exploring areas like Morgantown now that i can at a normal fps. I played during the weekend after a break, I'm still amazed at how well it runs now.
---
There isn't much to do though. Vendors rarely offer legendaries and you know all the plans they have which most are prohibitively expensive. Seems like legendary enemies have been nerfed across the board, so even when you do find one you can bet money on getting some crap armor piece. I was dead ass just walking around trying to find graham yesterday before i just turned it off.
---
Now would be a great time to add some content.

lmao it‚Äôs just out of battery /s

---
You‚Äôre not alone... far from. They have been telling people: 
---
1. Stop playing the BETA and buy the full game
---
2. Hard reset your console 
---
3. Uninstall the game and delete cache and player info then redownload the game
---
4. You‚Äôve been banned for having x.... 
---
Keep in mind 1 through 3 won‚Äôt work and haven‚Äôt for anyone. 
---
Look at Twitter Bethesda Support... it‚Äôs all the same, submit a ticket that they don‚Äôt respond to... worst support ever.
---
At the current moment with the current version of the game, in my excavator armor with the calibrated shocks mod on both legs with the radicool perk, and all unyielding armor pieces with marsupial and level 3 strongback.  With the carry weight bug that boosts your carry weight in the excavator PA by 100 I can carry between 6-700 pounds for about 30 min when I first log in, its nuts!
---
If on PC: [Perk Loadout Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124)
---
I heard it wasn‚Äôt though; from asking around, the ban error is much longer. Besides that, a number of folks that got the email with an itemized list of what they has supposedly had in their inventories, many of which were ludicrous. One million fuel? There is (hopefully) no one dumb enough to dupe something so useless in such a high number. 
---
Slugger and deathclaw? Isn‚Äôt slugger a 2-hander perk and deathclaw is unarmed/fist?
---
Yep, but I joined a couple of those and they have fizzled out. For clarity, we are ‚ÄúThe Enclave - New Appalachian Chapter‚Äù but I get you. That‚Äôs why I tried joining a couple of the others first but they weren‚Äôt great.
---
So‚Ä¶ The Responders meets The Enclave.
---
Gotcha.  
---
No lol.  Just to have some faith that the nukes dropped for a reason and to not go all cannibal or raider.
---
If you have Discord, we have a casual "guild" with some guys and gals, a couple in the UK as well. Let me know and I can pm ya a link to our discord channel on here. 
---
The one at the lake can spawn legendary but still level 50. Here‚Äôs hoping I‚Äôll see a level 90 legendary one roaming!
---
In that case they should have been flossing while wearing neon clothes and a fishbowl head.
---
Yeah I named the wrong perk. I meant iron fist. Thank you. 
---
You weren't playing alone, everyone else was just couched so you didnt see them on the map ever.
---
But no that sounds amazing. Anywhere but the middle I wonder If that lvl 190 guy in full power armor and rifle out is heading for me to steal my precious paper bag of goodies (after i die) or is going to pass by, wave, and keep going. I'd prefer a smaller group of people to play with sometimes, I mean this is a wasteland after all.
---
I have lockpick permenantly equipped and had no need for hacker perks or to unequip lockpick. 2 characters over lvl 60 and main storyline complete..soo maybe just chose 1 or the other and work around it
---
May his blessings be upon you and your pants be eaten last!
---
1. Trash cans in front of Whitesprings shops
---
2. Overseer‚Äôs Cache at the Overseer‚Äôs Camp
---
3. Wherever you feel like. The world is your trash can now! 
---
I'm the opposite. I wish there were more players on a server, as it already feels like a lonely, abandoned place. I actually server hopped on Saturday to leave a server with only two other players to one with more people. :(
---
It should work but some command lines have to go into the prefs.ini instead.
---
I've moved mine many times around my camp, and my spawn point doesn't change. I have tried.
---
+1 for the ramune. -10 for the non-Herman Miller chair, though üòâ
---
Well the 1st option seems fitting since It feels like I accidently played the BETA for the last 3 months.
---
This is the code given to players who have been caught rubbing their genitalia on couch. You sickos.
---
That is BETA info; won‚Äôt help at the moment. 
---
True, it was needed in Skyrim...but in FO76 I wouldn‚Äôt be adding those perks mainly because I‚Äôm a sneaky build. There‚Äôs not much need to ‚Äúsneak‚Äù into a locked suitcase laying in the middle of a highway. Lol. 
---
Out of curiosity, when you build CAMPs in locations like this, where does fast traveling take you?  Do you have to scale the Hornwright building every time you want to visit your CAMP?
---
Ha! I know right! Longest BETA ever...lol
---
Yup, got fried yesterday.  Logged out at Whitesprings for RL stuff - come bad - cue sad music.
---
Ya and your account is only 2 days old.  Stop lying.  You got banned for duping.  No one feels sorry for a cheater. 
---
If you do the, entire base is a foundation then yeah but then you couldn't put turrets out. Turrets out Ima shoot it
---
üåïüåïü¶ã
---
Built a sniper character at launch, built him up, never got a TSE weapon but got a very nice Two-shot gauss.
---
The nerf to two shot basically made sniper builds completely useless when compared to a melee or heavy weapons build.  Melee can one-shot everything but SB and SBQ (and sometimes even two-shot SB).  I can't come close to that kind of damage even with the old TS damage, but now?  Now, even with the highest damage rifle in the game (two-shot dragon) or a gauss, it's barely better than a regular rifle.
---
Yeah, I know, another QQ thread, but there could have been much better ways to handle the OP-ness of TSE... which really was handled in changing the dynamics of demolitions expert with Explosive.  There really was no need to nerf TS as well which wasn't a problem.
---
So I haven't played since that nerf.  I don't have any desire to go and build a STR based character (heavy or melee), much less start a build from scratch.  Maybe I'll come back if Bethesda un-nerfs two shot, but I definitely cannot find the enthusiasm to play at all in the current state.
---
&gt; killed them all with an Instigating DC Gauntlet.
---
Ironical, like rain on your wedding day.
---
This would be a great change. I wish there were a separate timer that showed how much time was left in the actual event (as opposed to showing you how long since you saw the event) but adding free event travel would mitigate the risks of getting there with 3 minutes left to go. This is a big issue for me. Half the time I jump into two completed events then give up.
---
Found him between dolly sods and harpers ferry
---
It looks like they‚Äôre a jerk who threw a fit when you didn‚Äôt say PC (surprise surprise) so I‚Äôll go ahead and say no, there isn‚Äôt cross platform (and likely never will be) 
---
&gt;No one views the Legend of Zelda series poorly because the CD-i games were hot garbage.
---
That got a good chuckle from me.
---
Some guy is wandering around a few miles away when he suddenly gets buried under a pile of dead legendary creatures.
---
I've had a few of those, but noticed no real damage to the target.  For an extreme example. I have an exploding stalker...flamer, but I've watched the health meter of the enemy after hitting it several rounds, and while it's pretty cool to shoot and watch, it's not a potent effect.
---
One for exploration and one for camp, loaded automatically when inside the green circle.
---
It's not anything close to Fallout, but Apex Legends is pretty damn awesome. And it's free to play. It's what I play when I get a little too aggravated with the bugs
---
I think that they didn't mean for the glitch but I never see people post about it on reddit 
---
This happened to my buddy and I yesterday...the whole map was ours, it was awesome 
---
Sorry to people on pc and Xbox. Can you please ask a ps4 friend about this and I can help them out
---
Same problems here i Trust u 100% my friend and me are Playing this game without any Dupe/Glitch since BETA and we using Storage Charackters to save our legendary stuff and i know any items of his inventory like he know any of mine Bethesda suck atm My friend want to stop play now
---
I'm on XB and the vast majority of players are fun to be around and generally helpful. Only had three unpleasant encounters in over 250 hours since November's launch. And even the unpleasant encounters were brief and easily dealt with.
---
It also happens when your in a team with strange in numbers and a person goes offline. For some reason you loose your mutations until you leave your team. 
---
Aside from the obvious, the amount of time allocated to complete the quest is just plain wrong. You literally have  to get there when the quest begins or have a lot of help, otherwise forget it...
---
Oh god you're gonna get it when the hate patrol arrive lol I totally agree though.
---
This sub is quite schizophrenic with not much consensus on much but hopefully we'll all be on the same page when we get some more content and stash increases.
---
Maybe so? Idk, I found some ammo in the northern most rail station in the divide. Just chilling in a trash can next to the armor bench. Lol. Had a couple hundred or so of a couple kinds or so. I took what was there and dropped some stuff off in the same trash can, figured someone might happen upon what I dropped off.
---
The only true trading sub is r/Market76
---
???
---
Boom this comment! Yeah it would be amazing if traveling agent was permanent but the point is that you can switch things up. I‚Äôm very lazy so I understand it‚Äôs annoying to keep swapping cards a ton just to do repairs and crafting but it‚Äôs part of the game. 
---
My internet hated that game, made it damn near unplayable for me. Only have 4mb/s download so this games shit graphics worked alright but that, cod, swbf2, bf4, all the big stuff never works quiet right 
---
What vendor did you find it at?
---
Thanks. He's going crazy having no mods at all
---
You‚Äôre right, one could make an argument for almost all of the perks but after 300+ hrs in this game lock picking/hacking is one of the only perks that tends to bother me. The use of those perks hasn‚Äôt changed from level one...
---
There needs to be some kind of auto-swap system that, for instance, (1) allows you to set up a hotkey or hotkeys, (1) allows you to assign a perk card configuration to each hotkey, and (3) disallows you to auto-swap during combat for fairness.
---
Should be good for a 1* wood leg.
---
People randomly downvoting anything mostly
---
I think they mean in regards to rank 3 perk giving only 20%, whereas 3 rank 1 perks give 30%.
---
I‚Äôm on console. 
---
Everything in every subreddit gets at least some downvotes. Welcome to reddit. 
---
That's from November 2018 beta wouldn't help anyway 
---
I'll be back after some more bug-fixing and balance patches.  For now I just picked up Final Fantasy XV.   
---
Call me when the railway RIFLE uses RIFLEman perks.  It's got RIFLE in the name.  And when carry weight is fixed, and bulking is fixed, and events are fixed, and ...
---
Because Bethesda decided to invite PvP players into Fallout.
---
This is from November and from the BETA. Not too helpful now it seems
---
Sometimes it places me right on top of where I currently have the camp placement thing, other times it puts me inside the building but I can easily work through the wall and only have to scale up a bit only 2-3 jumps 
---
Did you look into anybag that had duped items? I'm sure that did it. Maybe because it registered to your account
---
all I'm saying is lockpick fits with the sneak skill set, besides in FO76 there is never anything in those suitcases that is worth the effort
---
TSAA and BAA both don't exist. 
---
People think they can topple Bethesda by downvoting reddit posts.
---
Login faild account not authorized 4:8:2000
---
Goddamn it. How did you know? 
---
Your account isn't gone, by what others I've seen on here your account is in suspension until Bethesda patch the duping problem and they will notify you when it's done and then you can play again.
---
Whilst I agree that you should be able to pick up junk as it's a mechanic of the game, the signs were there that this stuff may have been duped ( 10k copper) and tbh I think you really shouldn't have picked up the whole amount.
---
What are you supposed to do with them?
---
I‚Äôve been wondering that as well. 
---
Don't we usually get them Wednesday morning? Sometimes Thursdays on console?
---
Vanguard's BoS Combat Armor with Deep Pocketed or Ultra-Light and Dense on the Chest.
---
&gt;Gankstar
---
The fire effect, like several others is a 4 star effect, meaning you can only get it from four star enemy drops, which are not implemented. So no, only on special weapons.
---
The ammo or the technical data? 
---
Technical data
---
angry fat sausage fingered players mad their duping ways are going away little by little
---
I didn't know you could get plans to craft the PA pieces themselves. Makes me wonder how to get the raider ones. 
---
It‚Äôs more like every time there‚Äôs one upvote, someone comes through like it‚Äôs their job to knock your post down to zero 
---
Yeah, this particular Event hardly seems worth it.  Even when it takes place in the Mire or Bog, the Legendaries you get aren't Lv. 45/50.
---
Same as you. I bought it like four days ago, and finally got to play it yesterday (crappy wifi + big download), and it is awesome. It is still super weird to see other people walking around, since this is my first time seeing this happen in my 14+ years of playing Fallout but I'm getting used to it.
---
I'm aware, and I expect *some* down votes when I post elsewhere too. I'm referring specifically to this subreddit, where *everything* between helpful suggestions and common complaints about the game just get down voted. 
---
Maybe you cannot log in because you tried to get developer room items, you dolt.
---
Hope that marine helmet was worh it.
---
Low level players always pick lock supply drops and get a 5 cap wanted status because of it.  Because the "Get Supply Drop" mission appears on anyone's HUD who is nearby, and the only warning is the "Steal From" on the pick lock.
---
Plus previously the loot was free for everyone and instanced, so when one player called a drop in, everyone got it.  It was quietly changed back in early January.
---
When the option Bethesda literally gives you to fix the problem makes it worse.
---
If you‚Äôre looking for a different RPG series, try Dark Souls. Similarly, I thought The Surge was ok, it blends both Dark Souls and Fallout in a way. If you‚Äôre on PlayStation, Bloodbourne and Horizon: Zero Dawn are both good titles. Mass Effect; Andromeda has some interesting exploration and fighting mechanics from what little I played of the demo. I recently jumped into Elder Scrolls Online and I‚Äôm enjoying the quest content and progression so far. 
---
You trade it in with the Brotherhood of Steel for a side quest. For experience, caps and some ammo and maybe a weapon or plans
---
Like I said down below, my boyfriend can't get in either and he doesn't have a bunch of items, as he wanted to make sure that there was no way he would be breaking the code like the dupers were. None of his stuff was removed at the patch (he was worried he may have gotten something that may have been duped when trading with people. All my boyfriend wanted to do is play his game and Bethesda is not being very helpful in answering the tweets or responding the the tickets. 
---
Lol yeah but I GOTS to know what‚Äôs in there!
---
I've started about 10, lol, but I actually play about 3 regularly:
---
* LV 50 Generalist: Charisma at 4, all other specials at 8+. Most perk cards at only 1 pt. Jack of all-the-things. Fun PVE
---
* LV 45 Guerilla: AG/LU build. Super effective PVP. PVE name is &lt;Mr-out-of-bullets&gt;
---
* LV 30 "Bloodborne" or "Pirate". Started as a pirate joke build, but has some real merit. Black powder, swords, etc. Around 30 switched to BB theme with "vampire costume", monocle and top hat. That build out uses Heavy weapon (gattling gun), black powder blunderbuss and various melee
---
Oh ok, I see what you mean. 
---
Yeah, as much as it annoys me that their weapons trivialize armor, it *is* nice to have one kind of enemy out there that commands your respect on the battlefield.
---
This is great
---
If your main source of damage is sneak attacks, escape artist is a must. Simply crouching down when detected by enemies give you a short window to sneak attack attacking enemies to death.
---
It does not work so well against SBQ though. You can still get some sneak attacks in, but it is inconsistent.
---
That is absolutely not true. I was playing with a friend the other day, he got DC'd for some reason, and when he tried to rejoin us he got stuck on the "world full" queue for 15 minutes before someone dropped out and he was able to get back on .
---
I wanna say I got a Raider plan from a Toxic Valley Treasure Map.
---
Lol at everyone down voting you dude. Almost 700 plus hours in and the only duping I‚Äôve taken apart of was buying shit from other people so if that‚Äôs duped and I get banned for whatever reason why tf isn‚Äôt everyone. I got the same shit yesterday dude, no response from Bethesda except that I have a hard copy and for whatever reason the only thing linked with my Bethesda account is the beta code so now I have to put in a digital code that isn‚Äôt even fucking provided cause I have a HARD COPY. Fuck all y‚Äôall thinking everyone is a cheater. Obviously you ain‚Äôt shit cause morally you have something wrong with youüòÇ
---
They originally announced it for November 2019. Hopefully it happens before they stop supporting the game entirely.
---
600-700 game hours in 2 days is possible easy
---
Hello,
---
Players who receive the *‚ÄúLogin failed. This Account is not Authorized. \[4:8:2000\]‚Äù* message when attempting to log into Fallout 76 are using an account that has been identified by our Customer Support team as having acquired over 100,000 of one or more rare in-game items within 30 days of play through duplication exploits. These accounts have been suspended from Fallout 76 until this issue is fixed in a future patch. Once a fix is live, we will reactivate these accounts and notify the owners that they can access the game again, but any further violations of the [Terms of Service](https://bethesda.net/en/document/terms-of-service) or [Code of Conduct](https://bethesda.net/en/document/code-of-conduct) will result in a permanent account closure.
---
The items that resulted in these account actions were designed to be rare in-game, and we‚Äôre confident that players who acquired them in these massive quantities did not obtain them using legitimate means. Those who are playing the game normally, even if they craft a lot of items, can rest assured that we will not deactivate or suspend their accounts for legitimate play. 
---
If you think you are experiencing an exploit in your gameplay experience ‚Äì stop using it immediately and [let our Support team know in a ticket](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10?prod=1129&amp;cat=287).
---
If you feel you have experienced an issue regarding another player, including observing them using an exploit, we encourage you let our support team know by [submitting a ticket here](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44235/kw/how%20do%20I%20report%20a%20bug).  
---
Barbarian breaks when you have mutations that show halves of a special.
---
Keep an eye out for those. Your first number is a good consistent round. Try to maintain it.
---
Just had marsupial for the first time, I figured this out here. Was in a nuke zone and rad-x was suppressing it. 
---
While it was probably duped, I was in necessity of copper (needed it for crafting and to rebuild my base).  I didn't really think that I would be suspended post patch.  However, that's not the case.  It could take Bethesda weeks-months to fix this issue.  I've also heard of accounts being wiped after their suspension has ended.  I will not go back to playing after hundreds of hours of gameplay to get my characters leveled up and the caps to purchase gear that I needed.  I do appreciate your input though!
---
I‚Äôd wager because of how entrenched people are. 
---
Some people see any positive post and they downvote, some people see any negative post and they downvote. 
---
This is what I think as well. 
---
IMHO, this is a direct reflection of how much more enjoyable would this game be if we were allowed either solo runs and/or private servers. I really do not enjoy the PvP aspect of the game, and in some occasions i've ended up wanted because the game didn't even warn me what I was about to loot belonged to someone else. Granted, it's been a month, almost two since i've last played, so things may have changed since.
---
*Wooo* It's your **4th Cakeday** lersday! ^(hug)

Killed him again. If I loot his corpse does he stay dead?
---
Well here‚Äôs your official response

Maybe it was the 37k rounds of ultracite ammo you had 24 days ago?
---
I can't wait until merchants adopt crypto currency and the rest if us no longer need to have the costs of your charge backs passed on to us.
---
Damn, :/ thanks for the info. Maybe they will eventually. It would be nice. Lol
---
That sucks and that challenge was bogus, hopefully they see the stats of completion and move away from it.
---
Get this: I died last night and the game froze. So I lost all my junk again. I think my best option at this point is to try to find someone who‚Äôs willing to sell me the armor so I don‚Äôt have to try and get all the screws
---
I think my favorite part of this game is having a lot of plans unlocked and making dope camps and workshops all over the place 
---
Is this applicable to all of the people getting this error? It seems like there are quite a few who have the error and are adamant they never had over 100,000 of an item. 
---
Is there a potential for some false positives in this system? 
---
Thx from a quick scan I seems slot of high lvl players have this issue (200+) and some commented that upon emailing Bethesda they found their accounts were banned. In one case the commenter noted that Bethesda cited specific items of high quantity on their account. Could this be false positive given that players like OP play ALOT. If case then it‚Äôs unjustified ban. It could also be that while you may not have directly duped, you helped or aided alleged action in some way, shape or form. For example, if someone gives you 1million dollars and they told you it‚Äôs stolen money are you not commiting a wrongdoing?
---
Regardless my stance on the whole duping issue is that as long as player did it without manipulating game code but simply performing actions within the game world allowed by said game code then it is within their every right. If the intent was to not allow such action then it is the coders responsibility to not allow it.  
---
To assume a player should play in a morally righteous way is the stupidest and dumbest assumption one can make especially from Bethesda. Need I remind anyone what the game play of fallout predecessor games were all about?  Games were players where not only allowed but many ways encouraged to steal (if sneak was high enough), manipulate(if charisma was high enough), murder. Does no one see the hypocrisy and irony here?
---
Probably because of the idiots.
---
Any chance you got the prime receiver plan for the 50? 
---
&gt; Power armor benches still glitch to the next floor.
---
The alternate style with the curved arches and smaller feet doesn't seem to suffer that problem, so if you don't want to tear your roof off to place a PA station you can use that one instead.
---
G.I.R.L. Guy In Real Life
---
I mean, it could've been from that too.  However, I no longer have any of that.  I dropped that off to store junk to fix my base that I couldn't keep built to spec lol.
---
First of all, how dare you. Second, kinda. That one will, but there are multiple mothmen/mothman species

There is one by Solomon pond, north of twin lakes. Follow the stream from ore pond west, and you will find him in s lake next to a large blue machine.

Got a prime receiver plan for the 50?

have not played FC.  just watched the trailer.  so that is where every one went!!  ha ha!

i may just have to buy that game this next payday.  poor fo76................:-(

That might be part of it. I always fast travel
---
So *that‚Äôs why* my wife got all the loot last week when we did a few drops. I could‚Äôve sworn we all used to get loot from the drops, so I‚Äôd cover her while she picked the locks from the drops, then go check, and it would be empty.
---
oh crap i think I dropped a few cuz i had no idea what they were lol,the tech data that is
---
You insert the bone meal as a catalyst, and put the other ingredients in a different slot.
---
Based on your posts in the marketplace and bazaar you might of knowingly of unknowing been dealing in some shady shit. 
---
Do you have the Fix it Good perk cards for guns? I have a Lvl45 with heavy barrel and it hardly ever gets damaged. 
---
The reason is that YOUR way of grinding ruins it for everyone else. Getting robbed of a legendary kill by some idiots rocket turret, who isn‚Äôt even there to take the reward? That‚Äôll make me angry enough to destroy someone‚Äôs base (something I would never, ever do, I a a big fan of camp building). If you can‚Äôt kill them without building a turret base then you shouldn‚Äôt be there. 
---
You're down voted because the half a million inventory weight full of ultracite ammo and stealth boys and nuka grape and other rare items. Nobody except other dupers think you're innocent so stop trying.
---
Lol.  Sure.  So you just create a pocket universe where time is much faster.  You know there‚Äôs only 24 hours in a day right.

It's time to uninstall

Let's be real here though.....
---
You admit in both situations that you knew both the copper and the ultracite ammo were likely dupes. Whether you duped them or not doesn't matter. 
---
You were cheating. You got a temporary ban for it.
---
wht is really sad is that the reddit server is empty.  i thought i would find the fanboys/girls there.
---
I wanna join!
---
Because you could just not contribute anything to killing an enemy then take loot , for example waiting around white springs golf club for someone to clear it then looting the ghouls.
---
It‚Äôs not something that‚Äôs fair to implement
---
This your other account where you pretend to be the girlfriend?
---
You just want to be able to get free items from every corpse you come across?  Why would that be any harder to understand than not getting XP from them?
---
Can you legally chargeback the game if you got banned this way???
---
I‚Äôve got 3, one rifleman, one 2 handed melee, and one heavy gunner/ unarmed, levels 90, 27, and 55. I wanted to change my first character to heavy guns, but found I would need 20 levels of respec, so I just made a new character.
---
Interesting. Thanks for this. Definitely going to give it a try!
---
This is the same automated response that everyone is getting in their support tickets. 
---
So, in theory, if I picked up loot bags that had x amount of loot in it, whether it was duplicated or not, and I didn't know it was duplicated because it's obviously in a loot bag with no one around, I could still be flagged for "being a duper". I'm still waiting on the list of items that I personally have been suspended for having to see whether my theory is correct or not. Because if not, I have no idea what else it could be. 
---
This is beyond frustrating for me and everyone else who is confused as to why, exactly, we got this suspension/ban. 
---
Yeah, people act like its some forecast for impending doom, while it happens in most (if not all) games with regional servers that don't constantly try to balance players over different servers (through e.g. matchmaking). 
---
I've had it happen countless of times in The Division, doing Dark Zones after midnight, eventually there are more people going to bed than there are new people filling up servers. And the exact same thing happened more than a decade ago in the (pre-millenium) Counterstrike / UT'99 days.
---
Sorry no prime receivers for any weapons. 
---
Sure I‚Äôll take them, I started a new character anyway 
---
Unfortunately, I feel like a lot of people ended on the same deal.  I started to stay away from that kind of thing after realizing what the duping stuff could really do.
---
Pfft. They shouldn't get greedy. Pick up like 100 and move on. 
---
I think the better, more game like solution would be to make perk cards only changeable at set points, such as in your camp or at a level up.
---
Dapper Gaming
---
Wow the hate squad are in here!
---
After 450+ hours I'd say yes. It's worth it. People talking about PVP?! I've tried PVP once in that 450 hours. It's not a PVP game but there is a harder PVP mode coming.
---
What I've heard about accounts being wiped after the suspension is only the items that they deemed duped would go and the rest being intact 
---
All hail Mothman, for he is just and his lights bountiful.
---
Yao-guis count, you can always find one in the parking lot of the cemetery by prickets  fort and the big temple.
---
Yeahhh save em :p they nerfed the stuff you get if you do it in bulk, so just hand in one at a time or two, it's up to you :p
---
Bear in mind most are level-gated, although I managed to find a lvl1 once, by some corpses near an electric pylon. 
---
I agree, I think it's a great game, however it isn't Fallout 5, which is something that I think a lot of the people that are angry with the game are forgetting. They said from the start that it wouldn't have NPCs, yet people are surprised when there is limited story. That being said, I hope they do add human NPCs, maybe through DLC, or the vaults.
---
I'm not sure.  However, whenever Pokemon Go changed their gameplay from the 3 step system to a somewhat similar system to what they have now... it worked.  I think it's sort of similar.  The game is not playable as it was whenever I purchased it.
---
PS4?
---
Orbital Strike Beacon?
---
I‚Äôm online now
---
I love these stories. Here's mine from a couple days ago.  
---
I was chameleon hiding on the roof of my house, going through some perk cards. I stop long enough to see a wanted person in some PA jogging past.  
---
"Yo, chief." I shout over the mic.  
---
He stops to look at me, trying to figure out where I'm at.  
---
"You know you're wanted, right? I ask.  
---
He flashes a thumbs up.  
---
I told him I'm not going to collect on him and sent him on his merry way. But I didn't tell him about the other player that was already stalking him. I track them both on my map, watching this little hunter/hunted scenario play out. The little yellow dot inching steadily closer to the little "wanted" dot.
---
Pretty soon, from the other side of the hill, I hear this absolutely epic cacophony of war and watch as the hills light up with explosions for at least 30 seconds non-stop. Once everything died down I checked my map. A single yellow dot remained.
---
Not sure for laser/plasma, but a Tesla shotgun (charging shotgun barrel mod) does not benefit from shotgun damage perks. It benefits from rifle damage perks regardless of the mods. My guess would be all energy weapons work this way, but I can't say for sure.
---
You mean those 25K nuka colas aren‚Äôt legit?  Damn my game is wrecked! 
---
I did a WS run this morning and stopped by WS station to find 750 bobble head explosives sitting there.  I picked them up only to realize that‚Äôs probably a bad idea so immediately dropped them.  
---
I'd be careful with charge backs. It's a good way to get yourself blacklisted.
---
Yes, I know. I can see it to the left of the bone meal slot. It even has a quest marker right on it. But I can't select it.
---
I would but I'm carrying too much caps and junk to risk it sadly. 
---
We posted a response in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/arhr4a/login_failed_this_account_is_not_authorized_error/) on the same topic. Essentially, accounts that are receiving this login message have been identified by our Customer Support team as having acquired over 100,000 of one or more rare items in-game through duplication. These accounts have been suspended until this issue is fixed in a future patch, and those players will be notified once their Fallout 76 access has been restored.
---
The problem with this is that your account is now "flagged" for picking up too many of a rare item.  I don't think that's necessarily fair.
---
well I want you to look deeper into my account as it is 100% legit never done any type of glitches only things I have large stacks of is ammo but none of it is over 14.000 and I have got all that by crafting and use of perk cards,also its all on my toon none of it is in the stash box as I use the reduced weight perk card and armor with reduced weight if you look you will see only a few weapons and armor so something is very wrong fix it.
---
Interesting. I didn‚Äôt get banned, but it‚Äôs good to know I have some sort of recourse if I do get randomly banned. I haven‚Äôt used any exploits, but I was suffering from a bug and the customer service is laughable.
---
Well that's my cringe for the day
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be my first choice
---
I scrapped 3 and didn‚Äôt learn it.  I‚Äôve scrapped 2 combat helms and didn‚Äôt learn yet, but I did learn metal helmet with one scrape. 
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 
---
Here's your soundtrack for that fight.
---
https://youtu.be/QrlPuveLAAw
---
I honestly thought the same thing.
---
Bullshit.
---
My bad, sorry. That marine armor just eats it for breakfast.
---
I just got a Shotgunner perk from a pack, so I tested it myself with a scattered laser rifle and you're right. It doesn't benefit from any shotgun perks either. I guess that's that. 
---
This is exactly how it works, you can server hop to get your daily allocation.
---
Not trying to be rude, but do you really think that people who play games with PvP don't also play single player games? 
---
Unfortunately I had 90 of these on me when I did the turn in and it ate them all for some small reward. I only carried the all on me becuase they do not weigh anything. :( I have way over 100 of the GSD holo tapes and I just assumed that they will work the same way, so I have never used them. Either the quest should give you a bonus for more rewards as OP suggested or only eat one of them and a time and not the whole stack.
---
Hah. No. My boyfriend just doesn't use his Reddit account. 
---
I'm a girl from Canada üá®üá¶  with a baby. Not sure about that guy.
---
Not in Quebec apparently. :)
---
I have 2, currently. I need a 6th slot for my character concept to be fully realized. Main character (bloody unarmed, full mutations) is "me," but had a little breakdown after leaving 76 and ended up with split personalities, reverting back to his childhood escape, the unstoppables. The other characters all have the same basic appearance, but the personalities, builds, and outfits of the Mistress of mystery, grognak, silver shroud, etc. Only problem, 5 unstoppables, plus "real me" ways 6 character slots.
---
They give pure cosmetic buffs and debuffs. Like enemys that explode in a firework.
---
It's even more bizarre when yesterday's Daily involved scrapping a piece of Responder gear, few of which are easily replaceable.
---
You're supposed to be able to buy bulk screws from some of the train station vendor bots but they never have them. Is this because someone buys them out before I get there? Is the vendor bot inventory shared? 
---
What a deal.
---
Better call your mule account. You're going to need some help hauling that payload home.
---
Ironically I think that the players who have been cheating with duped materials will probably find that they don't really enjoy the grind once they can no longer cheat.
---
Just like any computer or program. Let it fully load before you try doing things.
---
Yeah, it took them over a week to send the 500 atoms for the canvas bag to my live account.  So, I don't expect a whole lot.  I've noticed on twitter that PSN is taking note of tweets associated with the ban and is trying to take care of some of it.
---
You just described all the other people that fall outside of the smart/smarter group.
---
Who the hell who paid any attention to the game pre-orders the game? Who keeps it still after playing the beta? Not the people I described. 
---
That would be helpful, thank you!
---
Mothman will remember that.
---
Has anyone ever actually found anything in an overseer's cache besides what is supposed to be there? I always check them and I've *never* seen anything extra in them. I find stuff in suitcases daily. I'm wondering if those caches are reset more frequently than other world containers. Maybe people should try using some alternate container.
---
‚ÄúSensor Array‚Äù is the sensor array mod for Excavator Armor.  All the excavator mods don‚Äôt have a name but are identified by their black titanium.  
---
X01 headlamp is the headlamp for the X01 power armor.  
---
Okay buddy you are not cheating, its totally normal to have that many Nuka-Grapes. Dont be a twat next time and play after the rules, but whatever, i hope you get banned.
---
If you dont mind me asking where did you find your plans at?
---
Not all are bad but it's rare that you have rage quitters and people throwing remote controls across the room in an RPG.
---
Going back to the earliest days of on line Call of Duty......PvP players on average have leaned towards toxicity.
---
Oh I mean I didn't mind playing every second I could of the Beta!  Made it to somewhere around level 30-40 by the end of it.  I had a lot of fun! I didn't start having real fun until it came out and got my first 1\* Bloodied Fire axe.
---
Might benefit from rifleman or commando perks. (depending if single shot or automatic)
---
Us I attached  the sensor array to my excavator  but is it literally just the regular headlamp 
---
I have to be honest, I have never really needed BF. I always run out of Asbestos for repairs! 
---
Awwwwww yeah!!!
---
It's fun to play with once you crack level 50 and can start playing around with different load outs, but prior to that I would just grab the first rank of each card. Tripling the points and only getting double the output seems like a waste when there are other things like Incisor or Barbarian that will help out more in the early-mid game. Also, since melee characters are so up close and personal they tend to take more health and rad damage, so I find having 3 points in traveling pharmacy is a good trade off for the slight boost in damage.
---
My normal set up is level 3 traveling pharmacy, level 3 incisor, level 3 Martial Artist, level 3 Scattter Shot (I carry a couple shotguns for back up &amp; crippling SBs), and 1 point in each of the Slugger perks. Everything in the game including level 85 SBs will drop with 3-4 swings at most, so the extra damage is overkill.
---
If we're doing an SBQ run and I have someone else to take care of knocking them out of the sky I drop traveling pharmacy and scatter shot and swap in the maxed out slugger cards, but that's the only time I do it. That's also when a few other situational cards like Tenderizer get swapped in.
---
And you sound like a salty 12 year old with no life
---
I tryed buying a new game because i even want to buy 1 for my friend and gave it to my friend with problem i chattet in my post here and he tryed using the code game says code acceptet and he still cannot login i tryed using code on my working account it say to me code acceptet maybe u cant add a game to a account who have already this game so this is definitly a bethesda problem!
---
there is no way its from "regular ammo" its the clearly duped items. 
---
i craft 10k+ 5mm every other day after a ton of grinding and i have not triggered a flag/ban.  
---
a braindead person wouldnt have it trigger on standard ammo because of .50, 5mm, and fusion cells alone would trigger it in like 5 minutes of crafting
---
The poster of the Excavator Power armor you can find in game that leads you to the quest for the plans has a neat looking paint job.  I'd like that one.
---
I had the same experience lol there wasn't anyone on my server pretty much. I got allot done and nothing got done at home :)
---
I just use the plasma rifle flamer mod. Better damg and more ammo. 
---
My house is over there and so I normally kill him when I log on.  He does randomly spawn legendary, but he has never dropped even a 1* for me.  He does drop a large pile of stuff that makes decent mats and caps.
---
But my armor has to eat too.
---
They also frequently spawn at mid-mountain cabins, the mountainside B&amp;B, and the Seneca Rocks visitor center.
---
Does it not seem likely that your system got a lot of false positives at this point? Every other banwave has had a few people who dispute it, this one is MUCH more heavily disputed. 
---
I struggled with this too. The slot for the other materials is to the left and below the terminal screen on the same device you put the bone meal in. It has a very small activation zone so you might have to slowly move around to get it to show on screen. Here's a video that shows it if you need further clarification: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J-HjWVHTLg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J-HjWVHTLg)
---
Well, hopefully it's just that.  I guess my assumption now is that if I kill anyone with anything over 500 of something, don't touch it.  And don't trade anyone for any ammo over a low amount.
---
You can often find a hermit crab on the bridge just NE of Harper's Ferry. They're relatively slow, so as long as you stay out of claw range you should be able to take him out.
---
I sometimes exploited the pocketed armor glitch when the game first came out. Bethesda kind of invited that one with the 400 stash limit.
---
10k copper and 37k rounds of ultracite ammo.......you were cheesing it pretty bad there.
---
At least you can keep your weapons. That makes the grind a little bit easier but I think when you get back you'll find that you're spending a lot more of your game time farming mats.
---
The clubhouse has windows. Doors won't do anything. And there's a difference between another player taking 3-5 ghouls and a 16 turrets with no owner nearby shredding almost all the ghouls.
---
That‚Äôs what happened to me too. 
---
He can appear in the bog? I thought each cryptid was confined to its relative zone.
---
I will pay real $ if we could get a skin for it.
---
If you follow the riverbed southeast of Flatwoods towards Charlseton you can often find chickens, squirrels, and foxes spawning in the area around the broken boats.
---
There's a tunnel under the highway to the east of watoga going up. Just go up the tunnel. It's growing all over there. All the bad guys will be above ground. 
---
I doubt people from Northwest-America are going to join me on this **eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com** server I'm currently connected to.
---
Usually people on PS4 call it a PSN and Xbox calls it GT
---
 No problem. He has been stalking my present char since he was level 8 and has killed him once. My present has killed him many times now, and welcomes more attacks.
---
 This most recent time, we chose to kill him up with a Sword. ;) My OSE Shotgun is hardly needed at this point. ;)
---
They might be. I even joined an Asia server couple times. 
---
Less than 10k players playing= dead to some people
---
GENIUS!!!
---
Sensor Array mod isn't a Headlamp mod.  I believe it gets +2 Perception.
---
Headlamp mods are separate mod slots for Power Armor Helmets.  Different colors, brightness, and sometimes shapes like "Vault Boy".
---
Watoga supermarket has jetpack plans for T45,T51,T60 PA
---
Why didn't you drink them all and collect the caps? Not like you can pee or drink yourself to death lol.
---
I hate to do this, but unless you can get it at a fair price, I'd wait until Bethesda release their roadmap ( in a couple of weeks) to decide if the game continue in the right direction.
---
I've been playing since the open beta and still have fun with it (casual playing).
---
Lol... ok buddy.
---
I agree, dude should have died. They need to remove the ability to log out while taking damage.
---
I played a good portion of yesterday and most of the time it was me and maybe a few others on the entire map.   This morning I log in early and I come across a half dozen players chatting at Watoga station so we did some trades and it was all good. 
---
As someone that accumulates (and uses) a lot of caps I like more players as there are more trading opportunities.  But I also see the benefit of less players around too.  
---
I never used that exploit.  I had no idea that was even a thing lol. 
---
As for the ammo, I couldn't use it (I didn't have the weapon for it).  Easier to sell it to people who do or just trash it.  As for the copper, I've probably accumulated a good amount of materials, just to run out of stash room and have to sell it as bulk to fit more costumes.  
---
Hopefully their new "trading" system will fix some of this ambiguity.  
---
No I mean the X-01 headlamp is it just the regular headlamp 
---
I would say do it. It‚Äôs cheap right now and honestly it‚Äôs fun. Don‚Äôt be a try hard and power level to max when you play. The game is so much more enjoyable playing at an enjoyable pace.
---
One thing I would say is look up missions that give special weapons you think you will want them and just hold off on those until you get to level 50. Not a big deal there are plenty of missions to do up to level 50 and still avoid those. 
---
The game basically won‚Äôt get any cheaper and will only go up in price if they fix everything and it picks up popularity again.
---
I like it for my build. I'm building out  a recon sniper who uses lots of stealth.
---
This is what I‚Äôve seen the most. It‚Äôs convenient for everyone because everyone needs to go to the vendors. 
---
Yo I think
---
Not my first choice either, but if I can't play it then why let my account sit with purchased account only stuff on it?  I've spent $110 on atoms since release date.  Not a lot... but surely more than most.
---
Unless it's sub $10 cheap, I would hold off for at least a few more weeks.
---
It's real uncertain if the game either has legs longer term or if the team that's working on it is competent enough to pull it off.
---
So far results have been mixed trending negative. The fact that you're even asking the question and not just rushing out there to buy it is all the answer you need.
---
I think this speaks to the perk card system being conceived with team play in mind. I recall a post-E3 interview after Fallout 76 was announced where they were speaking about how a team of players could work together by specializing - one could be the heavy weapons user, another could be the medic, and another could be the lockpicking/hacking expert. It's a novel concept in theory, but for the myriad Fallout players who choose to play solo, that idea of roleplaying falls apart. This makes sense in games where your skill choices are a little more permanent, but not when you're never locked into any kind of specialization and can swap out perks at will.
---
I think the underlying problem with any online game where character optimization is key, players naturally gravitate towards upgrades that feel immediately useful in an active way. If I equip Gladiator on a character fresh out of the Vault, I should immediately notice a difference with how much damage my Machete is doing and want to continue investing in those perks. If I equip Picklock, well... now I have a button that lights up and I can loot some Pre-War Money. Not to mention there are *so many* perk cards and no way to easily manage them without an addon.
---
If /u/BethesdaGameStudios_ were to take a page from ESO's book, quite a few of these perks could be pruned by converting them to passive skills, leveled up via an experience-based system. The following perks could be all converted to passive skills and leveled up by performing their related tasks:
---
* Lockpicking (3 ranks of Picklock)
---
* Hacking (3 ranks of Hacker)
---
* Armorsmithing (3 ranks of Fix it Good)
---
   * Basic Armor Smithing (3 ranks of Armorer, 3 ranks of White Knight)
---
   * Power Armor Smithing (3 ranks of Power Patcher, 3 ranks of Power Smith)
---
* Weaponsmithing (3 ranks of Weapon Artisan)
---
   * Melee Weaponsmithing (5 ranks of Makeshift Warrior)
---
   * Ballistic Weaponsmithing (5 ranks of Gunsmith, 3 ranks of Licensed Plumber)
---
   * Energy Weaponsmithing (3 ranks of Science)
---
* Consumable Crafting (3 ranks of Super Duper)
---
   * Ammosmith (2 ranks of Ammosmith)
---
   * Chemist (1 rank of Chemist)
---
* Survival
---
   * Many of the Endurance perks are unattractive or just plain boring. I think by simply "surviving", many of the passive perks such as Lead Belly, Iron Stomach, Slow Metabolizer, etc. could be earned by naturally playing the game. Eating cooked meals and drinking purified water would grant more XP than spoiled food. Cooking a new recipe for the first time could grant bonus XP.
---
   * Cooking (3 ranks of Good With Salt, 2 ranks of Rejuvenated)
---
   * Hunting (3 ranks of Butcher's Bounty)
---
   * Gathering (Green Thumb, Woodchucker)
---
   * Exploration (3 ranks each of Pharma Farma, Scrounger, Can Do, Cap Collector)
---
   * Salvaging (Scrapper)
---
   * C.A.M.P.-ing (3 ranks of All Night Long, 2 ranks of Homebody and Contractor)
---
I might have missed a few here and there, but many of those perks are ones I'd bet you spent several levels obtaining, but only a tiny percentage of your play time actually using. Useful perks like Ammosmith and Fix It Good are only going to be slotted for a couple minutes while you're crafting, while the couple of hours you spent worth in leveling up could have been used for unlocking perks that provided benefits for the other 99% of the time you were playing.
---
Anyways, however it's handled, I think a perk card prune would go a long way to address the perk management issue and make choosing perks more attractive and rewarding. :)
---
I hate those things. All Bethesda has to do is extend the no build boundaries. 
---
Fallout 76 was never an MMO in the spirit of EQ or WoW... It was merely branded an MMO by folks who view anything both online and multiplayer as an MMO.  In actuality, it was a half-assed multiplayer online (HAMO) game in the same vein as GTA 5 Online - designed for the ground up to minimize operating expenses while maximizing 'acceptable' micro-transactions.
---
The leveling up process changed a LOT.  I‚Äôm at lvl 109 but it‚Äôs been a slog as I didn‚Äôt join and play right away when the game came out so I lot post nerfs. 
---
Try having one steel and jumping into the deep fissure. There's always someone who's so greedy they'll jump in to get the bag.. Then there's 2 bags xD
---
Oh, ya.  There's X01 Bright Headlamp, X01 Tactical Red, X01 Vaultboy, etc. etc.
---
The regular one just lets you go back to the regular headlamp if you want to after going to something silly like the Vault Boy headlamp which projects a Vault Boy icon from your Headlamp all the time.
---
I have a fire effect on an explosive laser pistol. It‚Äôs too bad it last 8 shots before breaking   
---
mentioned the whitesprings nerf in another post
---
pre whitesprings nerf you could make a alt really quick to test out different builds
---
now you can't even do that now 
---
Fewer people playing overall doesn't necessarily translate to fewer people on each server.
---
It's clarified here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/arhr4a/login_failed_this_account_is_not_authorized_error/
---
It is infact a ban, although apparently a temporary one, for those account with more than 100k of one or more 'rare' items.
---
Is that really the demographic for fo76? Did they do any more info dumps could be cool to look through
---
Honest opinion from me is a solid no. A very solid no. I have poured quite a few hours in and have a lot of the higher end things you'd want. 
---
I think the community is too ardently defending it, but I can understand why. There are good parts. However realistically it's not worth jumping in because there are no long term benefits.
---
You're much better off waiting to see if it turns itself around. Right now there just isn't enough end game and there are lots of ghost town servers. There is still fun to be had, there are cool people, but the game itself is lacking and doesn't have anything coming up to be excited about. There are lots of builds that have been weakened and lots of things that once fixed could create a better overall gameplay environment. 
---
However this game needs a lot of work. So my advice is to wait for some big changes and maybe hop on then. 
---
Thank you! I wasn't sure if trading was an 'offer' or like vendors and you just click it and DO IT. 
---
Both explosive and energy.
---
Two words: stealth builds. I don't care about damage resistance if I'm not getting hit. 
---
you have to be off the server. basically you re open for pvp anywhere. yep its dumb.
---
you cannot avoid the attack. if you do not return to the shop bench and remain in the green zone then the other player will win the workshop.
---
claiming a workshop is opting IN to PvP
---
It depends on what you believe the overarching conceit of the game is.  Are we working as a collective team, or is it to each their own?
---
I honestly don't care if I kill a Legendary enemy and someone else partakes in the loot, so long as I got mine.  Before I knew this, I used to gesture for others to come over and take part in my spoils - but that's only true if you're on a team.  It makes sense that you'd need to tag an enemy to get loot, but at the same time, it creates a race to kill the Legendary that isn't a particularly cooperative behavior.
---
I'm pretty sure taking a workshop opens you up for pvp anywhere on the map. 
---
It will take forever, plus they might flag mass drinkers of 1000 or more.
---
What country/platform are you playing from? I actually really like empty servers. If you're PC, feel free to PM me your discord/ign
---
I should add the easiest thing to do is draw the mob out with you and if they survive, they will destroy the base.  You won‚Äôt be wanted. You can also dashboard and cause multiple respawns and drag them out too. 
---
High end/level stuff and ammo I leave in the blue suitcase in Watoga train station.
---
Lower level stuff I leave in the chems box in Flatwoods church where the responder vendor bot is situated. I normally chuck a load of chems and food in there too, plus any plans/recipes I already know. I always make sure there are lower level toons in the area first though. I do this almost everyday. 
---
My only question is why they get unbanned when the exploit is fixed, we don't perma-ban exploiters any more?  
---
Also at no point did they mention taking those items away, although I would hope that's just part of the process they don't feel like explaining.  
---
Exactly, not everyone is cheating. Some people just woke up and were unable to play their game for one reason or another. 
---
We just want answers, and to all those who think everyone who got this is a cheater, why fight with them? Even if they did, the accounts will reflect that.
---
I, for example, have not received anything from Bethesda for my boyfriend's account. I am waiting for information on my ticket. 
---
Not a duper, not a cheater, just someone waiting to have this error (which is not even a ban code) to be fixed.
---
I THINK I got it set up. My bf had a gaming headset he gave me and I was able to get sound through it now I just have ot run a mic test. 
---
And yes, all the people I've seen either mind their own business or are very helpful :)
---
One thing to note, from people who entered the cheat area at least, is that optimized bracers seemingly do not exist for T51. So if you're like me and you spent hours and hours server hopping to try and get that....you'll never find it. 
---
Good to know thanks.  I like to use workshops as fast travel points.  I'll have to rethink that idea.
---
Fallout with split screen and online co op would have been amazing.
---
Something must have went wrong in your detection system. Or do I get banned when I trade over 100k worth of caps over 30 days? Which actually is not much for a trader with 1000+ hours...      
---
      
---
Or do you accumulated all kinds of junk? Ammo?      
---
I had like 10 atom keys, drank 10 nukas colas, gathered not more than a for thousand of a junk item over the last 30 days. Never duped or just traded dupers. Never abused xp or weight glitches.       
---
        
---
Why do I get this message? I saw a lot if other posts here, sometimes from causal games with similar issues. It seems that you auto-ban players with a broken script.      
---
       
---
The only thing I could imagine I gathered over 100.000 is ammo - but only if you count all kinds of ammo together. If that's the case you probably just banned most players with heavy guns because for those a consumption 5-10k ammo per day is pretty realistic if you play more then 3 hours a day.
---
Right. That's exactly where I have checked many times. I've moved my cursor over that whole area as slowly as possible to try and find it but have yet to. 
---
oof, yeah I can't imagine trying to IM during a fight lol. Thanks! I'll try to keep these things in mind!
---
Extremely rare for that to occur. I've been on every continent's servers, its very obvious which one is which, and if you're matchmaking normally (play button) you just go to your own.
---
Can he be tamed??
---
How do you think they survived to achieve legendary status? I had one in Haper's Ferry last night and as soon as he yelled 'run away', the other non-legendary super mutant with him turned and ran also. Enforcer perk works wonders to stop their escape. Someone posted a video a while back here of them chasing a legendary deathclaw through the bog that was pretty hilarious.
---
Earlier in the week there was a similar chain like this, where the posts were remarkably similar in content - I think it had to do with spontaneously missing "I totally didn't dupe them" items - where it made me wonder if there was a form letter somewhere.
---
Yes, your situation is what a server instance is supposed to do. However, some servers get bugged late at night (after being on for all day) and end up not replacing people for a while.
---
I rather like those servers, so I can have the queen/whitespring nuke all to myself + friends
---
I did not see a pacify queue from animal friend or wasteland whisperer. 
---
This isn't some egalitarian or utopian society where everyone waits their turn to get a hit so you can get a share of the loot.
---
It's the post-apocalypse; a dog eat dog world. Those that intentionally hit below their potential to allow others to get their hit in are the exception, not the rule. 
---
If you're that person, good for you. However, just because you see a legendary creature, doesn't mean you're entitled to it's gear.
---
I'm having the same issue and am on XBOX so... can't access the Developer room....
---
The Flatwoods appears in the Savage divide. They're most ddef not tied to specific zone.
---
There are a few Grafton monsters in Charleston.
---
Ive seen him all over. We had a glorious glowing one by the pumpkin house last week. 
---
If that were even the case, why would only some people get emails? That makes no lick of sense.
---
Was it explosive? he could be using a big guns bobblehead and psychobuff. 
---
You said he was half health so doesnt sound like bloodied/nerd rage/adrenal reaction/revenant. Also no idea what your setup is so could just be a any minigun like antiarmor explosive? They do fire fast.
---
I'm pretty sure it wasnt explosive, I think it had faster fire rate he was also in PA
---
So if I loot the corpses then drop the garbage it‚Äôll help keep the server running smooth?
---
If x &gt; 100,000 of a single item, then yes. Bethesda is saying those items were duplicated in all cases. You're not flagged as a duper, you're flagged as having duplicated items. Judging by their response, they have identified existing duplicated items as a risk to the game, and are mitigating that risk by eliminating the interaction of those items with the game until they can be patched out. After reading this reply, there should be zero confusion. You can certainly be frustrated at the way they've chosen to handle the situation, but it's not clear to me that there's a valid reason to be confused.
---
&gt;SanshaXII
---
ok?
---
If there is no proof, there's no point in beliving them.
---
I've been looking at perks and numbers lately, and there seems to be a lot of ways to be OP in pvp, I'm starting to think pvp is quite unbalanced. And I was looking at those numbers not using legendaries, just straight up normal missed weapons. Though to answer your question, probably has heavy gun wrap damg increases, stabilized and probably is using a legendary minigun,maybe using chems too.
---
The pvp in this game is horribly implemented. I think that's what they mean. But I may be completely wrong.
---
Well I absolutely agree with that. 
---
i rerolled to play with my brother when i hit 100. i'm level 9 now and its so much more fun.
---
there really needs help in end game though!
---
you can still do it just crouch all the time. it hides you from the map. but if you are around other players they obviously can look around the map to see if you own any workshops. thats what people do these days they will look for people that own workshops, fast travel to you have thier friend in team go to camp to claim it which opens you up for pvp.
---
oh yeah I forgot about those perks, that makes sense, thanks
---
Sorry man, that sucks. Maybe try it in or out of power armor? Maybe that will make a difference? Try it without a weapon in your hands? Maybe that's screwing up the targeting? Try getting closer or farther away from the console? In my case, I ran all around the facility thinking maybe it was something somewhere else. I looked at terminals, etc. Finally pulled up the info on my phone, ran back to the console and had no problem finding it. So maybe do something that causes a UI refresh like using a computer terminal. Those are all the ideas I have. Good luck!
---
Bethesda did give fair warning that if you are carrying/storing thousands of certain thing it will get flagged. You could have dumped it or not picked all of it up to prevent them from flagging your account before the sweep.
---
The thing that really gets me - and this is mostly for Power Armor mods - is that they provide zero explanation at a vendor for what they actually do.  What is a "Blood Cleanser"?  What are "Optimized Bracers"?  You either know it or you don't.
---
The best mod I've found was simply called "Bladed."  "Bladed" what?  I haven't tried it - I assume it's the mod for the Mole Miner Gauntlet, but would it have really hurt them to spell it out?
---
No prob.
---
Sadly
---
Acknowledging time and the inevitability of death is not Pessimist.  Seems time and mortality is a touchy subject.

i dont care about votes on a forum bethesta need to know about there own faults like commetet on alot of posts [https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/arxn1f/thanks\_bethesda\_for\_that\_482000/](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/arxn1f/thanks_bethesda_for_that_482000/)
---
It feels like who ever was writing them was in the middle and it became their lunch break  forget what it was for  and just put it in
---
Yep, I've crashed to desktop 4 times just this weekend. I'd only crashed twice before then.
---
I only had 1 disconnected from server, though.
---
They posted the emails.
---
Guess I've never tried in power armor or without a weapon. I'm not a fan of power armor since it dulls the compass. But I will try it later today, thank you very much.
---
That's bullshit because I don't have 100 of anything and no duplicate weapons or gear.    
---
You‚Äôre right. I did bulk up what I could afford to do and sell whatever I couldn‚Äôt use to get a few caps. I probably realistically only kept 5 bulk..?
---
Assuming someone is going to be dead by their 50s is definitely pessimistic with today's medical advances. There's also absolutely no reason to bring it up in a gaming forum.
---
Bugs are real. No evidence for a form letter.
---
on the bos side of the asylum I usually come out with \~25-30 military ammo bags which are 2 ballistic fibre each when broken down 
---
Happened to me too, pressed enter so fast though. 
---
Maybe there is some issue with the process they use to set out emails maybe.  Last ban not everyone got emails either.
---
Thanks for the response. This sums it up pretty well and I think you nailed it. (Fist bump). 
---
I was in power armor at the time and got the message that I was killed by XXXXXX's nuke.
---
I'd like to believe that there will come a point where magazines and bobbleheads can be displayed, at least.  Same with Power Armor.  But beyond that, I have my doubts.
---
By the way, I'll never cease to be amused by how "Wouldn't it be nice" has become something of a meme for suggestions. üòâ
---
It's not MY way of grinding, I just took advantage of someone else's camp during my own grinding.  Why not take the advice everyone always has for people who don't like PVP scenarios and just change servers?  
---
I just think it's really shitty to get pissed off at people so much that you destroy something that they had to invest perk points into (since you need higher ranks in home defense to put missile turrets down) all because you aren't able to exploit a horribly designed areas legendaries in the most convenient-for-you way that you can.  
---
The people who did this are no better than the PVP griefers out there, maybe worse since at least griefers aren't usually doing it because of some made up morality system they have devised for themselves - they just do it for shits and giggles. 
---
The only thing in my account that could possibly meet this criteria is ultracite ammunition. (Which I still doubt I've hit that number)
---
That would include all ammo I've crafted myself or for my teammates, and all the ammo I've helped teammates move between characters (a function they should be able to do themselves somehow but thats another issue) over the course of the last month?
---
Nothing that fits into a 500 round magazine should be considered "very rare."
---
And eliminating everyone on crutches wont cure polio.
---
I was in power armor at the time and got the message that I was killed by XXXXXX's nuke. So I was definitely standing there when it detonated, not after. Just incredible timing.
---
Nah we got players getting banned in the Danish Facebook group as well, they all duped or looted a shitton of obviously duped items 
---
That is a lot. 
---
My base has 2 rockets turrets that i only turn on when i fight scorch beasts.  My entire bottom floor is designed for people to use and hang out. I don't know why people hate it so much.  It's pretty much the only other time i run into people other than the queen event. 
---
50+ is all equal.
---
During the last ban the community managers it appeared followed up with some of the posters, and later indicated the posters that claimed Innocence where lying and there was a legit reason for the ban.  There are a lot of posts, I'm sure they will follow up in some way with statement.
---
Ah, I see.
---
Of all the griefing you can do with team invites, that's pretty harmless.
---
I really hope we will get something like that.
---
And yeah it‚Äôs just so nice to start with hah
---
Yeah, I'm a wuss in the mire/bog out of my PA so I was definitely wearing it when doing this mission. Had to exit in order to craft the rad shield at the very end. If you're on PC, there's a mod at nexusmods that corrects the wonky PA compass.
---
Could be possible in Fallout 74, however it is not in Fallout 76.
---
2day old account with -22 karma? Yeah seems legit 
---
For sure isnt Fallout 5, and i did not expect Fallout 5 anytime soon. I also want that game, but im also glad we got 76. I wouldnt mind npc‚Äôs. But im good either way. 
---
And i dont get mad about games ;)
---
I think the list of items is an important aspect to this question. For example, if Ammo - the most easily legitimately mass-produceable item in the game - were anywhere on that list, there's no doubt people are getting false flags. 100,000 5mm rounds in 30 days with trading, lead farming, ammosmith and super duper? Easily achievable if you play a decent amount. I think there are a lot of people that think they "legitimately" "found" a bag of 100,000+ of item X on the ground and "had "*no* *idea*" it was duped" lol but if ammo is on that list legit people could actually be hit by this.
---
Well... 
---
even the best make mistakes.
---
But i think you noticed allready because i just made a mistake. ^_^
---
I got my first nuke yesterday on an empty server. Nuked Whitesprings and had the place to myself, it was great. Got disconnected before I could get to my death bag and lost a decent bit of loot but it was still an enjoyable experience
---
Minute changes don't always move it and I think there are fixed spawn points that you move between, so if the move isn't great enough to shift it an entire spawn point over, it will stick to the one it's in.
---
Can't even say if it works everywhere though, I only tested in a few camp locations.
---
The email they send was a "no-reply" email address. Will asking for a list there get me no reply?
---
It‚Äôs mind boggling the stuff people dupped, it‚Äôs virtually easy to get mostly everything ( other then the rng plans outfits ) but for material and even ammo with a bit of dedication everything is achievable I personally go trough a few thousand of rounds every play time ( and usually craft double of what I‚Äôve used ) 
---
Nice dismissive comment but not true, you can‚Äôt really begin to optimise your perk cards until you get to level 50, and optimised perk cards significantly impact your build. I doubt anyone has 9 stars in the slugger perk by level 50.
---
The doors most certainly help, I've gone to the clubhouse where there was a missle turret outside the back.  Ran in, lured the ghouls to the basement floor (which had the door closed) and took out the ghouls.  I lose maybe one or two to the turrets in the process.  
---
If you really want to take advantage of them, use a simple explosive gun tag all the mobs and run them out and let them get killed, saves you ammo and durability in the process.  Some people LIKE those Camps there because they are a convenient spot to repair and stash things in many cases without having to slog all the way to the hotel itself. 
---
There would have to be multiple camps for it to be a problem - if there is that much of a problem, just leave the server and join another one.  
---
I still don't get why people think it's ok for them to exploit the poorly designed game (with leveled enemies that spawn everytime you server hop, along with clothing items that sell very well) but it's not ok for other people to exploit it there way, especially when they had to devote perk points to get it.  
---
My man!
---
I don't think bulldoze was intended to remove all or even most natural objects. It's intended to remove 'small' ones, and it does that pretty well overall, like small-medium rocks, trees, plants, etc. 
---
My main issue with it is that the removal isn't permanent unless the object you placed to remove it remains in place. This isn't surprising-- we're constantly logging into new servers-- but it is a bit of a pain, I find.
---
I took it slow with the story so I was at almost 50 when I first got out there. But I'm on PS4 so no mods for me. I don't think my desktop could play Super Breakout let alone this monstrosity.
---
they could have just done a borderlands-esque thing, and it would have been this great always, but nooo they have to make a mentally challenged MMO
---
Not just the Excavator, also the Ultracite PA
---
Because this sub is mostly filled with complete wastes of  good oxygen.
---
Since this is a multiplayer they yet to figure out a way to make it into a ‚Äústatic‚Äù non lootable environment.
---
Kinda think about it as visiting somebody‚Äôs camp close to being inside the vault (almost nothing was lootable, almost all static objects )
---
If only Bethesda had a dedicated fan base that they could have gauged to find out if they even wanted a fully blown always on line multiplayer game. 
---
He‚Äôs actually being pro social and tagging rather than killing mobs before others get a chance to tag as well.
---
It‚Äôs good behavior.
---
I just got messaged from Bethesda that im banned for duping, i picked up like 50k Nukcacolas from a bag a long time ago
---
Oh yeah! I couldn‚Äôt tell you how much handmade weapon I have crafted. I used to have my base setup by Watoga and I would served hop for lead and steel. Then use the ammo smith and the chance for double the craft perk for that extra boost. That kept me afloat for a long while. 
---
So what is the yellow eyed one? The only time I've seen one is in the trailer, and in game it's just red and purple. 
---
Apparently 20,000 Nuka Colas = 100,000+ rare items. 
---
Gloves as an individual accesory would be cool aswell.
---
Mothman can appear anywhere, my first battle with Mothman was in the Cranberry Bog
---
I've never learned any of the alternate ammo receivers on any weapon from scrapping. Not sure if it's just bad luck or by design. So I finally broke down and bought the plans for them when I see them at vendors.
---
Oof
---
Got same email saying I picked up 100,000 rare items in last 30 days... how does anyone do this??? 
---
But how they prove they weren't duping? Or using exploits?
---
base in question I guess. https://imgur.com/a/plf10Bf
---
Ah my first behemoth. I was running away from a Scorchbeast cause I didn't feel like fighting one (this was near bog town I think) and just as I managed to get away from the bat... BAM! Freaking behemoth and his Chibi super mutant brothers semingly pop out of thin air and I let the biggest "oh shit" out of my mouth I ever had. Then I die. When I respawn I get the message to reloot my junk but since I knew it was only like 5 steel I was like "nope, nope nope nope nope you can keep it thank you very much. Who need steel anyway?"
---
Never seen another behemoth again.
---
I think it was a nightmare.
---
Still lack steel most days cause I craft a lot of crap.
---
Shotgun with enforcer perk and concentrated fire to cripple giant creatures. Leg them and kill at your leisure. It does wear off after a bit, so don't goof around too long. Works on the wings on scorchbeasts, too.
---
Vengeful Mothman can be red or yellow eyed. Glowing and Scorched have green eyes. I have yet to see the scorched one. I hope I see him soon!
---
Boy if this wasn't dead after the updates it sure is gonna be after this. 
---
My question on all of this is how does everyone have over 100,000 Rare items? seems odd to me that everyone has the same amount...
---
That was my favorite town and I had a base there but I got greifed so hard one day that I left it behind. Alas. 
---
About 60gb on PS4.
---
A couple of givs monthly.
---
Yeah, I would‚Äôve been upset a few weeks ago. Right now I couldn‚Äôt care less. 
---
&gt;rare in-game items
---
I mean... it's in the actual post. Does that sound like ammo?
---
You are either on to something or on something...
---
Banned because i found a bag with 1,000 of each junk item. Thought it was luck and built my house. Now im banned. Didn't duplicate anything and did think it was a crime to pick up the items 
---
 Finally, some recognition of my skills
---
Yeah this is just the newest iteration of "Bethesda doesn't care blah blah". Zzzzz
---
I do understand, but I'm mostly confused as to what I had 100k of. Whether it was ammo, junk, etc. 
---
Wow.. I‚Äôm not even mad.. that‚Äôs impressive 
---
Just got the standard suspension email. Going to try &amp; get my list of items. 
---
It's a ban, been having this prob since sat. Only just got the email....
---
Same. I got the email too. Level 250 with 800hrs in and I'm totally content with them removing themselves from my life üòÇ like a shitty ex I couldn't stopped fu@king because the booty wasn't as bad as not having it. 
---
Umm... are you sure it's not the 4th of August, 2000?
---
 There is a wedding at the Lucky Hole one on youtube. A couple got married there. ;)
---
Your friends a liar lol
---
There is no justice in the wastes, only Zuul.
---
icebox at whitesprings club house
---
I could not be more adamant that I have never once had 100,000 of 1 item. Your system got it very wrong and you've suspended many many innocent players. 
---
I'm going to state it again and again. READ THE SUPPORT TICKETS PEOPLE ARE SENDING IN. You have banned the only legitimate players left in your game. 
---
In other words singleplayer.. and yes I agree!
---
Your friend is confused or just full of shit. Just like flipping a coin a thousand times- you'll get a run on a certain result for a while, but it will always even out.
---
Holy long walk for a short drink of water!
---
Lmao I have no rare in game items that are multiples. I have 2 hunters long coats if that's what this is  about???
---
so, did you dupe the 20k or "find" it
---
I duped it
---
The reason there doing this, is because after the last patch they thought they deleted all the surplus duped items and stopped the doping exploit,,,,they were wrong, so I believe this is a knee jerk reaction to stop more duped items flooding the market 
---
Well, since so many people are talking shit under this post heres my comment.
---
I've tried out tse,instigating/explo,Furious/explo many hours.
---
Anti-Armor/Explosive is the very best for PvP. I'm still one or two shotting most players above my level.
---
TSE is shit after the nerf. My opinion. It's still okay for PvE but my Anti-Armor/Explo Handmade and Shotgun are still doing a ton of damage in PvE+
---
Furious/Explo: Good for PvE, but only for large enemies (SB/SBQ).
---
Also my Furious/Explo is sometimes the only way to kill other player with the same Sentinel set i have.
---
Bloodied: I recently got a Bloodied/Explo Shotgun. I tried it with about 20% Health and Adrenalreaction. My Anti-Armor/Explo is STILL better against players(Bloodied Shotgun was almost 700 Damage and Anti-Armor about 300). PvE not tested well enough. I think it's quite equal from my experience.
---
Conclusion: Anti-Armor/Explosive works best for PvE and ALSO PvP. Try it out folks!
---
Considering that players who don't dupe need to spend time in game grinding for mats to craft ammo....
---
You and your friend were cheating.
---
You know what, it would be nice and I agree with you, though is it worth it if it also meant further degradation of server performance?
---
If they can manage it without affecting the servers, fantastic! If not, I'd rather not have it, as much as I'd miss it.
---
If someone duped and didn't dupe for money then what is you doing, baby? Getting banned anyway
---
It's because if you kill a legendary theres 342,000 different potential drop combinations that you can get. If it even drops anything at all lol. So the hunt for that good item is a steep uphill climb and every legendary counts lol
---
Once they finally stop the dupe exploit, we will have our accounts returned 
---
I have a level 33 alt I use for workshop claims, farm camp plans. If you're a workshop claim and another guy comes into your workshop,  you can open fire on him and he takes no damage even though he's on your property. It's one sided that way.
---
Like Mtsai posted, if you own several claims you are easy to pk. You could camp one workshop and put turrets at the bench, should be good enough to keep it as most will look for easier targets. I just claim everything on the map if possible, haven't had a problem but I could care less if my alt dies, they can have the plastic spoon.
---
It says rare items for a reason
---
Just got an update from Bethesda, I‚Äôm banned for having 100,000 of items hahaha go fuck yourself and your shitty game that now your wrongfully banning people and letting other pip-squeaks still fuck up the game. Thanks a lot. 
---
If you wanted to look further, Scaleform is the very popular toolset used to create UI for AAA games, which outputs the UI layer as a swf. It's used widely.
---
They promised private servers at e3 ffs. It needs to be a thing NOW! Please Bethesda, Listen!
---
I mean i had around 20k ammo i grinded for naturally before they nerfed how you get it. After they nerfed everything where it takes hours to craft barely any bullets that lmgs just eat up so you literally spend more ammo defending homesteads instead of actually crafting them. Thats when i was fed up with the game. Coincidentally stopped playing soon after.
---
Especially since every ghoul in this game use to be a NFL running back. Sprint speed is ridiculously fast lol
---
What the fuck holding ppl hostage until next update in like 2 fucking weeks? With no clarity on what was happening, no guidelines to avoid a ban and cooperate? Yea fuck this company for the rest of my life. 
---
I can 1 shot a ghoul with a shotgun with no perks or buffs and ZERO perception. Js. Maybe you need a better gun.
---
There's always a "chain" of complaints in the same amount of time, it's either 4chin, a troll discord, or a disgruntled youtuber
---
 I have extra Addictol. ;)
---
Lol. negative karmaboy has spoken
---
I‚Äôm having an issue with getting a half decent mutation. The few that I‚Äôve gotten were a waste of time. I want one of the fun ones! üòû
---
The ultimate human sacrifice 
---
Blackwater mine exterior is good too, if you're in the area
---
Yeah. Duping for money seemed like it would be a pain in the ass. 
---
I did a little duping only because I felt at a disadvantage without it. I didn‚Äôt want to hurt the game. 
---
Honestly, I was thinking that Bethesda had to be turning a blind eye to it for this reason. 
---
Just aggro a whole bunch of mobs and run through their base.   You can probably even kite in a scorchbeast.
---
They get their base destroyed and you don't even have to lose a cap.
---
You were not banned for "having too many bullets" you were banned for duping. The only thing wrong here is that your ban probably isn't permanent.
---
I am not playing it now simply because I ran out of things to do. I think I'm level 70 something and I just don't see a reason to keep playing if all the quests are done. I know there is weekly or daily things but pffft, I have over 150 PC games alone on steam that all fight for my attention already. 
---
I don't hate it, never hated on it since launch. Just ran out of excuses to bother playing is all. I'll come back to it another day after some content is added just like I revisit all my other games when new content is released for them. 
---
Yeah thats the one. I want to see if scorched don't attack me when I wear it now!
---
I tinkered with scaleform a bit, years back, but I didn‚Äôt remember that its output was swf. Thanks for the info!
---
It takes even longer to farm the flux to create ultracite ammo.
---
The common player doesn't use ultracite ammo because of the grind involved. It's cheating to dupe stuff that the common player can't obtain.
---
I'm not saying that you're a bad person or anything but you did cheat.
---
I was saving up atoms to buy a PA skin and was super disappointed when I found out none were for the excavator, like I get why people might use a different PA if they are going into a big fight like the SB Queen, but for general question and exploration, nothing really beats the Excavator because of the extra carry weight.  cmon!
---
I tag with my Tesla Rifle only at the Golf Course, and only when people are camping there and eating the enemies whose spawns were triggered by ME.
---
Fight bullshit with bullshit.
---
100,000 items in the last 30 days. YEA SURE BUD. Let's just assume you arnt way off on your accusations just like we assumed you weren't way off on your finished product and your power armor edition.
---
https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=fo76+reddit+is+it+worth+buying+yet

Not sure why this keeps coming up. Plenty of existing posts to reference.

No wonder I never got this error, I spent 40$ on atoms

Leg them with enforcer and just poke them in the ass with melee.

I have no sympathies for you. You took the risk and now you suffer the consequences.
---
The bullets themselves may not do much more damage but you bypassed the material gathering and crafting time to make them.
---
The game is in an okay state for the leveling experience.  Most creatures die easily irregardless what weapon you use so you don't notice the unbalance.  There is plenty of content to do and story to explore.  After you finish the main story line and start grinding you start to notice the problems.  Like trying to kill a SBQ and the server crashes, or playing legendary lottery.  Finally the realization sets in that we still have no idea what the future of the game is or why you spent hours farming gear.
---
I mean i never duped personally. I just recieved duped materials, if you wanna demonize me for that go ahead. Only reason i did was as stated before. They had just nerfed mat gain to the point of ridiculousness and I really only enjoyed LMGs for big pew pew. Even before the mat farm nerf. Id spend hours to be able to use a minigun for a few minutes. Lmao if thats the standard you guys are cool with then apparently im not missing much.
---
HEY HERE'S A KNOWN ISSUE
---
You're banning people who didn't participate in your broken s\*\*t show of a launch, who were against the duping, who were just trying to quest. Guess what? You don't have enough players in this game to start banning everyone. I was excited for vaults, but now I will uninstall. GG Bethesda. I'll take my microtransactions back to your competitors.
---
I'm not asking for a complete overhaul I'm asking for a color palette change. 
---
I don't think I accumulted just over 1.000 of any rare item over the last 30 days. Still I just recieved a mail telling me that I did.       
---
So I can only assume they count ammo together or ban if you trade for over 100.000 caps over a time span of 30 days. For some 100k caps may seem much but it's actually not more than 4-5 rare outfits or a dozen useful max level weapons. Not much if you're an active trader.
---
So if I one shot it people bitch and if I tag it people bitch. 
---
Omg, that's so sad. You cheated, got suspended and you came here to complain not to find some way to get your account back but to bitch as a passing blow on your way to Anthem?
---
Good luck with you not getting suspended for cheating in Anthem as well.
---
Fair enough there I guess. I just didnt value the ultracite ammo that much guess I shouldnt of accepted in hindsight. It was just much more convenient then spending hours upon hours of farming to just be able to use my guns for a single gun fight 
---
I agree with you too
---
I remember from fo4 that, when using the OCD mod the framerate wouldn‚Äôt at all be so slow as when you would do the junk decorating without the mod 
---
Praise be to Mothman on this glorious Mothman Monday!
---
Fishlamp and croquet mallets obviously sell better than a yellow and black CAT excavator skin would..... right?
---
Got my ban today via email and the ticket still isn't updated.   
---
[https://imgur.com/mklmf8p](https://imgur.com/mklmf8p)
---
I dont struggle for ammunition in a fps with anthem. So ty probably wont.  
---
*"Nah, my dude, he would totally never do that! We're buds, they'd never mislead me. I mean, sure there was the one time he turned me in to the teacher when we cheated on that test, but that was ages ago!"*
---
Even assuming that these people are being truthful, which on this sub seems really doubtful, that would make them *idiots* for assuming innocence in another and then shaking the tree to see what falls out. Amusingly, when you shake a Banhammer Tree, what you get is generally not a coconut.
---
That's actually a great idea. I have 174 of those lol.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt that be solved with the OCD workstyle?
---
My favorite is the, ‚Äú I found 20k ammo and 10k nukas in a bag on the ground and I picked it up and got banned‚Äù.  Lolz .....
---
This doesn't pass the sniff test smells like BS
---
Given how Bethesda gave everyone a pass during the last maintenance update, full well knowing that there are a ton of duped items in circulation, I find this hard to believe.
---
I have a similar problem on PS4.   I cannot play my main character. I'll try power cycling my ps4 tonight to see if it works, then I'll try the characater creation thing.
---
Thanks for the info  I'll have to be more careful
---
Is there a way to make the minigun good without using legendary modifiers? I was under the impression with how damage resistance works, it'd be borderline impossible to actually make it a very damaging weapon against armored targets because most of the damage would be halved constantly.
---
Assuming certain legendary modifiers are spectacular with it though, like wounding.  But that would be the case for any automatic.
---
Why would you buy another copy?  Couldn‚Äôt you just play it on another name instead?
---
What worries me is what happens if you bought a duped a weapon? I am pretty sure I did.
---
It will only piss you off "a little."
---
I got the .45 for the pipe pistol and I think .38 for the combat rifle from scrapping
---
the copy of your game is linked to account. im pc
---
Well, I‚Äôm real. And [I‚Äôm banned as of today](http://magaimg.net/img/7b3i.png)
---
Ahhh. Got ya. Sucks. 
---
theres power armor perks that help minigun accuracy and I think damage too
---
Or drop spoiled meat tol start a bag. 
---
Yeah, thats fair. Tbh I'm not talking about you; you seem reasonable and fine.
---
I'm still playing because I still haven't done everything and I just enjoy being in the world Bethesda created too.
---
Seriously - don't buy anything from vendors? What exactly is the point of that? 
---
Police uniform is a guaranteed spawn across the street from the Mothman museum.

---
still. Sometimes it looks good at first and then drop thru floor. 
---
You deserve it
---
üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Well, melee is a whole different story. Remember, melee gets 5% damage for every point of str. Hardcore melee builds will stack in stuff like Radicool and Solar powered and be pushing 50str. That‚Äôs 250% more damage JUST from strength. 
---
I played all weekend on xbox and had fairly full servers still. I think the lowest amount was around a dozen.
---
I understand. I exploited the pocketed armor glitch when stash was 400......and I don't feel bad about it at all.
---
The problem is....how much flux do you need to craft 76k rounds of ammo? And how much flux could one attain per nuke run?....I think you can get something like 100 flux per nuke run and depending on the ammo type get maybe 300 rounds of ultracite ammo?
---
You've gotta admit 76k rounds gave you a massive advantage over the common player. The queen fight has a 30 minute timer and some groups can't even finish it, meanwhile I've wasted 30 caps to fast travel to the event only to have it over in less than 5 minutes. Obviously some groups are cheating pretty bad and it's making a huge balancing issue.
---
Right. Don‚Äôt buy stimpaks. Actually because of the code, don‚Äôt craft them either. Or even pick them up. That‚Äôll be bad. Very bad. Horribly very bad. /s
---
You were suspended, not banned. Just an FYI....
---
Yea that's kind of where I'm at. Might as well try anthem out, but I still just dont know man. Gna force myself into something else tho. Really tired of being abused by this company. Being held hostage on their days off is the last straw. Do let me know if you find other games interesting, I'll come join ya if on ps4!
---
He's a cheater who got caught cheating. Whenever an online game does bans, cheaters will come out of the woodwork to ask for sympathy for being "unjustly banned".
---
I got the same email. The only thing I had in my inventory at any point was when I found a paper bag at Whitesprings containing 20K of each nuked flora. I walked to the edge of the map and discarded it so that nobody could exploit it. Shot myself in the foot in doing that I suppose. 
---
üôåüèºü¶ã!!!!
---
not exactly the same. this one says once a patch is deployed to fix the duping you are unbanned.
---
Look deeper into my account as well because this is ridiculous!   I haven‚Äôt duped a single item ever in this game and I got this same response today from Bethesda.  I can‚Äôt believe this!  
---
Ive seen videos of people getting it then being able to get right back on after a little bit. So if it is a ban how are they getting back online?
---
What... that Bethesda, the company that released a BETA version of Fallout 76 would also be lazy and run a script to autoban innocent people?  Riiight.  
---
this is not the first ban error we have seen today. interesting. good luck!
---
My brain hurts now....
---
I doubt almost everything you are saying. Bethesda wants people to play and enjoy the game. They are not going to arbitrarily ban players. I doubt that people reported you without cause. That sounds like nonsense. The algorithm picked your account up for a reason.
---
I have a complete set of TSE rifles, my game is fine. That's the odd thing with these shadow bans, it's completely random.
---
I got that same exact email too. Neither have i duped nor picked up anything that's 100K. Man if anything is has to be like from my ammo crafting habits.
---
I found my first and so far only behemoth when I was about level 15 or 20 while at whitesprings.  Lucky for me, it got caught on a fence, and stood still, allowing me to pepper it repeatedly with whatever garbage weapons I had at the time.  Took a while, but I got the bugger.
---
the more i read this sub the better i feel about taking a small break from the game and playing other games
---
Thanks. I really do appreciate the offer. 
---
So basically picking game items found in containers or loot boxes can screw you, no matter how
---
Y‚Äôknow, just like an hour ago somebody said it was strange that nobody has any email proof of this stuff happening. And now here we are...really gets ya thinking. 
---
LOL. 
---
My how the mighty have fallen. If you're innocent, hopefully temporarily.
---
You must offer l√•mp
---
Well I definitely earned my ban. I feel bad for those that don‚Äôt deserve it. 
---
Although nothing with Bethesda surprises me anymore. 
---
My maxes sniper is a one shot kill with head shots
---
Typical long story jargon to cover ur ass for duping!! Not fooling me lol 
---
Same here. No email, full accusation and lock out
---
It‚Äôs ESO all over again... good luck if you‚Äôre legit..! üëçüèª
---
Is there a difference in weight carry limit? 
---
I have 250 carry weight with no armour on, I get into my newly crafted level 50 x-01 armour and I‚Äôm still 250 carry weight, with no carry capacity bonus of any sort?! Really frustrating!
---
Ask support for the specific items that they say you had more than 100k of and post it here. It seems like this is key to determining whether bans or legit or not. 
---
And the key to getting support from this sub or not.
---
How do you prove \*you\* weren't? 
---
How does anybody?
---
 Do you just buy a hard drive to constantly record your entire time on the game, or just the last 30 days? 
---
A good script and math never lies.
---
Character crea-ception! Have fun :)
---
This just sounds like you're not taking responsibility for your own actions, so you're upset at the game devs for something that's likely your fault. Now... I know there are people out there that have legitimate concerns with this error. They need attention, not you. 10k copper... come on dude. You know you've been dableing around dupers. 
---
Isnt that a marked location?
---
I will upvote your honesty, I'm sorry if you get tons of downvotes 
---
what does that mean
---
Hey man at least you own up to it. That‚Äôs respectable
---
That's not really a duping thing, that's a "The server is lagging" thing.  I actually ran into that yesterday when trying to sell a Legendary too.  It languished in inventory limbo for about 30 seconds until I spontaneously was credited for sellign it.
---
That is just lag.  Log out and back in and the item will be gone from your inventory (as the end of your post points out).
---
Less than 1% of all accounts across all platforms were dupers according to Bethesda. I'm sure some people are lying about their bans, but there are too many of them for them to all be legit. 
---
What website
---
Yep like I said I got the bos shielded from current patch, so keep doing the quest.
---
Oh, you believe ‚ÄúI found stuff in a workshop container‚Äù?. Guess naiveboy has spoken
---
Oh, didn't you read above? You \*must\* of deserved it. 
---
Nah I think I‚Äôll just kill him, I‚Äôm not gonna worship a moth lmao
---
Okay - here we go. I don't even know how to dupe and I avoid people like the {scorched} plague, so lemme go see if I can get online. BRB....
---
I actually did find about 80k bulk steel and about 8 k nuka colas on the ground once. I still had about 2k nukas left, but I didn't get banned lol
---
I guess I don't understand how this happens- I've played world of warcraft &amp; elder scrolls online (etc.) &amp; there's alway lots of people on the servers, even on slow days. Why is it FO76 almost seems like there's a bouncer at the server door not letting more than 10 people in at a time?
---
I've seen a few that people posted, there is my proof so it is not a rule 7 violation and many people today are getting them.
---
I came across them, all they were saying was "yes" repeatedly. I ended up killing them
---
I've never been graced by Mothmans presence, I am not worthy of his presence, the ignorant prick. 
---
It reminded me a lot of the random back-and-forth "conversations" in the original Half-Life.
---
At least you‚Äôre not denying about duping üëç
---
You mean run a script to ban cheaters. Have fun fishing for sympathy you won't find it here. Take your conspiracy theories back to /r/conspiracytheories we don't need them here.
---
Not in the case of griefing I don't think. 
---
And who says maxing Int was useless? XD
---
This.
---
&lt;insert Fry meme - not sure if&gt; 
---
Not sure if legit story or karma mining clone post of the couple who played all night on a server alone, "best experience!" Hmmmmmmm, fallout post duping?
---
Wordplay... I can't play and have no appeal process... so much for due process here... I also never duped or had duped items let alone 100,000 of them or anything
---
I‚Äôm not out of class until 3pm EST
---
I see what you mean, and I understand your point of view, but it already happened many times where people just lie about their bans. I'm not saying they are wrong, but that the problem isn't as big as it seems.
---
I'm a lot of things, but a cheater is not one of them.
---
If you're going to whiteknight at least know what you're talking about before you attack innocent people like myself.  
---
Funny thing is that i happened to find two dupers and a while back, then attempted to despawn their items, never got any emails or anything. At this point, while I doubt Bethesda, it's obvious we aren't being told the whole truth by the players.
---
Screw the altar, I want someone to try sacrificing a player by "the thing" in lucky hole mine.
---
thats not mine email, my account is untached , i just read what other people post and conclusion is one - they counting common ammo also.
---
Ah the burden of proof on the convicted of guilty unless proven innocent. 
---
 The real point of this post. Asshole!
---
bye cheater. cry some more of those crocodile tears.
---
Yep -- still travelling the wasteland.
---
My best advice would be to not even ask! My favorite part of this game is stumbling across a prison or shopping mall and just exploring it without knowing what's around the corner:)
---
I find dumps all the time at WS but not like that, most are either junk and I leave it or dumped 1 star items that no one in game ever uses.   
---
I have shot ghouls through the windows at tennis court but never received even a hundred of anything. 
---
Have to think someone got too aggressive with the filters and included something like Adhesive or Steel.    
---
I'll have to watch my email if that's the case..
---
I've got a few hundred thousand steel on one of my mules for example, as I never ever dumped stuff, I'd just toss it on an alt mule account. (before the "Black Tuesday" weight cap of course).
---
@Bethesda
---
Things that ought to drop screws, especially when scrapping perks are enabled:
---
Robots
---
Binoculars
---
Scissors
---
Most guns
---
Most armor
---
What probably shouldn't drop screws:
---
Wild animals and monsters that don't use weapons
---
Its just a dick move, take for example the Uranium Fever event. People do that event for legendaries, killing the legendary so no one can have it just because its "the wasteland" is a dick move. 
---
Thank you!! Yes, I definitely love that feeling when exploring Appalachia! 
---
They definitely don‚Äôt. I have a shotgun build and anytime I look at available barrel mods for these guns, it shows the splitters doing the same damage as normal barrels. So if it did work with shotgun perks, their damage should show as higher for me.
---
They asked each other question back and forth.
---
"you know the meaning of life"
---
"no, what do you think about humans"
---
"thats dificult to answer"
---
Its exactly how do you expect 2 programs to interact.
---
When i talk to them one said 
---
"why are u shaking"
---
"nothing. You ever tho about killing humans"
---
"yes"
---
They Both looked at me. Needless to say i blast them off
---
I disagree, I don‚Äôt think they were human sacrifices. They‚Äôre cults so I think it‚Äôs more of a Kool-Aid situation 
---
I need to start making a list of lies people made up about this game.
---
There was the 'no encryption' stuff on PC, the data leak (was real but people lied and said it includes bank details)... erm what else?
---
Oh the last ban wave that Bethesda actually spoke out like 'nah, they were seriously duping'.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as0aea/banned\_im\_the\_900\_hours\_played\_guy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as0aea/banned_im_the_900_hours_played_guy/)
---
Hey man. Seems I got hit in the ban wave. Anyway you are able to assist? Fallout 76 is kind of my life right now.
---
Yeah, it's cause "Lundi Homme-Papillon" just doesn't have the same ring as Mothman Monday so they bailed. 
---
 Go ahead its fine, I bought an Instigating lever Action from Wallace quite a while ago. I could not believe my luck, and felt bad for the poor guy who did not understand what he sold. 
---
I had a high level player give me 150k nuka cola within about 15 minutes of exiting the vault. I was thrilled at the time but today I'm banned. I'm done with this game. 
---
Here's the deal... I never duped or have had 100,000 of anything so in some system it says I have. I haven't played that much in the last 30 days either so even harvesting 100,000 of anything is impossible at least for me to even think I could.   
---
Not being able to appeal or them not showing what I had like many others is wrong. People all get the same letter. 
---
It'll probably take a little time but Order of Mysteries for me is one of the best. Perhaps even across any of Bethesda's RPGs. This for me is Dark Brotherhood level of quest in terms of its writing and lore.
---
Its like a malfunction or somethin
---
Also I can't keep myself from saying this, but I'm pretty sure this is the second time I've seen you post before and you look EXACTLY like [my friend Jon](https://twitter.com/IridiumGameDev/status/1084546086654533632), who used to work here at Bethesda. You two are dopplegangers and it is insane. He worked on New Vegas, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76. Literally everytime I see you post I think you're him and that you're messing with me to see if I'd notice ahaha.
---
Purge
---
As long as you can get it for less than full price totally do it. Ignore the party poopers in this thread that just want to complain, the bugs aren‚Äôt that bad and the game is fun and beautiful. 
---
We‚Äôll just agree to disagree then because we could probably go around in circles forever. 
---
You believe if somebody willingly makes themselves available for PVP at a workshop then they should only be killed at that workshop.
---
I believe once you willingly open yourself up to PVP you‚Äôre fair game to be killed by other players. 
---
Honestly, I don‚Äôt really even care for PVP and they could remove it completely and it wouldn‚Äôt bother me at all. I really enjoy interacting with other players and going to their CAMPs just to see the different ideas and builds people come up with. 
---
It‚Äôs been fun bro. If you play on Xbox maybe I‚Äôll see you around West Virginia. 
---
I guess they are waiting for the next patch with the beefed up stash at 800.
---
Sorry, no undercover agents allowed!!ü§£
---
Did Bethesda hire someone to fucking comment on everything on reddit.
---
Ahhh... you're a liar.  Cool beans.
---
Nerd alert..... LOL
---
Tagging is fine. Killing before others can tag is lame.
---
Get over it.
---
i didn't say anything about weather you did it or not. only pointed out the others i saw did not have this statement.
---
Problem unclear, head is inside computer now 
---
It is kind of odd for them to address the duping by wiping the items, then a couple days later starting to ban people for an issue they had just resolved.  
---
Visit my camp when you're on ps4
---
Seriously..  I don‚Äôt even care if I got mistakenly banned. I haven‚Äôt logged on in over a month. 
---
He doesn't like me much, the first time I saw him he jump scared me. The second time he was out for blood and destroyed me hahaha.
---
If Bethesda had consumer confidence on their side right now, I'd agree with you. But they don't. It's the opposite. They have botched a lot of things related to this game, both in game and out of game. Confidence is down, so people don't trust that their algorithm is working. 
---
I agree, I did Enclave like 25 levels before doing the BoS 
---
psn name? I love seeing people‚Äôs camps and designs they come up with.
---
I am going to second this nomination.
---
Each item has an individual code that is separate from the base code.  (Any Fallout 4 modder can show you this in the creation kit.)  
---
Duped items have the same code.
---
For example:
---
The base code for money would be something like 0000009, but the money generated would have it's own unique code.  The unique code of duped items all have the same value.  They don't have unique values.  This is how Bethesda knows they are duped.  So their script periodically looks for duped codes on players and autobans anyone who has the codes.  
---
Something similar happened in Star Wars years ago.  People found a way to get free money or something and everyone that received it was banned.  
---
I hope those of you that were erroneously flagged have your accounts restored. For those that cheat, bye. 
---
It is but if you manage to climb to the top you can place your camp up there.
---
You aquired 100k of an item within 30 days, legitimately? It sounds like they had good cause to ban your account.
---
Order of Mysteries, for sure.  Not only is it probably the best quest in the game, but its rewards can actually be manually upgraded.
---
Cold Case is another excellent one.
---
That is what confused me, I got the audio of the sale right away and must have wasted 7 or 8 minutes trying different things. I guess it only does all the housekeeping on the inventory on logouts or timed intervals (someone mentioned 10 minutes, I think).
---
Gave him a heart after I slew him...

---
I'm level 117 and like you use two characters and always have like a mule.   
---
I never duped, I leave players alone, don't PvP, I actual watch over peoples bags after getting killed and help others... Mostly is that I've never had 100,000 of anything let alone rare items! 
---
Looks like I‚Äôll be good to play again in 2030
---
Fix your game and stop dumping on your fans
---
Bethesda just got cocky that their dupe purge actually went as expected, so they tried to push their luck, and true to form they screwed the pooch again.
---
I trust a guy with 900hr play time who just wrote up a how-to guide way more than I trust Bethesda to be infallible.
---
It was a few months back before duping was getting any exposure for people making TSE weapons in the selling pages. Among the flora was insane amounts of junk too. I figured the email mentioning ‚Äúrare‚Äù items was referring to those specifically. 
---
The thing that I don't get is they are basically banning people because they discovered a glitch in their game.  It's the software they released, are the players supposed to know when something is a glitch vs meant to be in the game?
---
How do you know all these people are lying though? Y'all act like Bethesda is capable of pulling this off without a hitch, which they've proven time and time again to be incapable of.
---
Yup
---
This is the very event I go low powered as described in the OP. However, I've never ever felt it was a dick move if someone one-shots the legendaries before I can get a hit in.
---
Like I said, there are a ton elsewhere. I don't cry about the ones I miss right in front of me.
---
Well, now I know ;-)
---
Lol, classic Mothman. I shall persist with my quest to meet him. Wish me luck! 
---
So, since you aren't saying \*when\* the patch is, this is an indefinite ban till you decide otherwise? Or just a passive aggressive perma-ban?
---
I‚Äôve never had someone try to take a workshop from me in my 100+ hours 
---
this
---
You never duped personally? https://media.giphy.com/media/EouEzI5bBR8uk/giphy.gif  
---
 But even if you're telling the truth, dupers crash the servers and wrecked any chance this game had for a working in-game economy. You still benefited from duping. You deserved the ban.
---
Leave the game if you don‚Äôt like it. 
---
But the Bethesda White Knights say that Bethesda can't do no wrong, you obviously deserve it. /s
---
Seriously though, hopefully they patch it up quickly.
---
I didn't dupe but I bought plans and weapons from PlayerAuctions and g2g, and I'm still not banned :)
---
My friend who hunts dupers though got REKT!
---
It could legit be a "drained" server. A lot of companies will take servers out of the pool available for NEW connections long before they reboot them for maintenance. But that does not mean they kick people; logged on users will remain logged on, often up several days, if they so choose.
---
So yeah, this is likely the case, actually. 
---
Source: we do this for our Citrix farm at work.
---
Send you a pm
---
I have a friend who is seeing the same message. This guy is a super casual player, wouldn't even know where to start with duping, let alone manage to craft 100k of an item.
---
However, he did tell me that in his first week of playing he came across a paper bag that had been dropped in Flatwoods and it had 75k molotov cocktails in it. He picked up the bag but obviously was over-encumbered so ended up dropping them again.
---
Is Bethesda's detection banning players who have had the slightest of interaction with duped items? Rather than just banning the dupers themselves? Honestly my friend is such a novice when it comes to games, I completely believe that he just stumbled across them.
---
okay!
---
Aw play it brother Al! Play it now!
---
Yeah heuristics are never wrong. No such thing as  a false positive. Nope. Never happened. Ever.
---
Rats.  Now I have the song "Boot to the Head" running through my mind, but with "Nuke" substituted for "Boot".

I think its a dick move. That person is well aware that other people want legendaries, but he still goes ahead and kills them
---
We have some paint jobs in the works for the excavator armor. I don't have a specific date for you just yet but keep an eye out! 
---
I didn't think that, sorry if you thought that. There are a couple posts on here basically saying the same. Just messed up that there is poor communication on their part and falsely accusing people without proof
---
Oh, cool!
---
Still waiting for those private servers, no point in playing the game as it is right now. The whole micro transactions really killed 76 for me. I can put up with a lot of bullcrap from a dev, been playing Ark/Atlas for quite a while now. Atleast Wildcard/Grapeshot doesnt charge for premium items/cosmetic skins beyond the inital investment for the game.
---
if Bethesda just opened private servers and let people host their own, this game could be saved from developer hell it's currently resting at.
---
Confirming this is likely related to Rad Worms, but we're planning to include a fix in this week's patch!
---
My steam account is over 10 years old and I've never been banned from any online game ever.  
---
I have no reason to cheat.  
---
Also it's not really a low level reward it scales to your level sort of, if you held off to 20 you would have got a level 20 variant.
---
Wonder how long it would take to kill a behemoth with just a rolling pin at level 15?
---
I have bought many items from vendors.  The other day there was a 3* TSE .50 cal. Actually the vender had 3 of them. All exactly the same. I bought one. Still not banned.
---
It was actually responded to already. Top comment. Please mark thread as bethesda responded.
---
All that's left are the whiteknight losers who attack people they don't even know.  
---
I actually know alot of innocent players that got banned because of griefing... myself included... 
---
Never, but gave often. Other day I had someone give me some stimpacks, was really happy so I guess karma does come back someday :)
---
But the very next day you have it away...
---
Because of how every game I've played online has gone through the same thing.  During Destiny 2's first ban wave we had these exact same posts and due to there being sites that track stats, gear, ect the community easily debunked these as did the community manager.
---
Can I third? I am level 56 now, and my Blade of Bastet (level 45, highest level it can go) is my primary weapon. It‚Äôs the main reward for completing the Mistress of Mysteries quest line.
---
it's easier to do a melee build. power armor is good for PVE, nuke zones ect..., dont PVP in power armor your a big easy target again this is where regular armor with % dmg reduction is way better. look for Cavalier, Sentinal, Powered or assassin armor pieces. All have dmg reduction. The way they name there armors is very confusing you need to actually look at the stats on the pieces. Example you can have a Cavalier piece that just has -15% dmg while sprinting you can also have another Cavalier piece that has 15% dmg reduction while sprinting with also assassin -8% dmg from players all on the same piece. So essentially an Cavalier and assassin piece combined but still just named "cavalier".
---
Is that the actual number?
---
Talk to me after the next patch.  
---
One does not simply tame the Mothman. Would you tame the sky? Can you tame   the passage of time? Nay. May the doubtful be plagued by a pane of glass in front of a lamp.

Abandon your cedar lined sprliritual husk. Give yourself over to all his dusty winged glory, and you shall be free..... Except in the presence of bright lights, a bon fire, or a fullish moon......
---
Did this twenty minutes ago. Worth it. Ugly ass camps anyway...
---
Not like I still have it. Sold it. I dont use .50 cals. 
---
No I mean, I would join the ranks as an undercover agent of the Order of Mystery 
---
Lol lol got em
---
I guess that's possible.
---
Might actually explain why I get those weird phantom Caps sometimes.
---
The game has only been out for roughly 2270 hours... and you played 900 of those hours? Did you really spend 40% of your total life between November 16th and now playing FO76? If so... maybe Bethesda is trying to tell you to take a break?
---
Looks more like a temporary suspension. Bethesda put you on the naughty step until they fix the dupes.
---
If a person is actually there in the base, kiting mobs to his turrets, I see no difference then me smacking them with a sledge. It means they can't tank like I can or they just want to have fun with their build. I won't touch their base. That is their way of playing and I can't fault them for that. The problem is **unattended** bases that nobody benefits from. If you are done farming, stop being a dick and clean up after yourself. Get rid of that base.
---
&gt;due to there being sites that track stats, gear, 
---
Bethesda *directly* stated they have no way to track items or to determine what is duped and what isn't. So this line really doesnt apply here.
---
If your arguement is that "people always say they didn't cheat therefore 100% of all the people saying it MUST have cheated" then I'd day that's a pretty piss poor arguement given Bethesdas incompetence when implementing new things in their own games.
---
I've had a lot of fun exploring the wide open spaces between marked waypoints.  It's definitely worth just wandering around, and I'd recommend the northeast quadrant of the map.  See if you can find the carhenge throne up that way!
---
I feel sorry for whoever you sold it to.  
---
Didn't even read your post. Being both objective and honest if you're having any issues with this game is mostly due to it being a lazy pile of rotten dog shit that should in no way have ever been released and whoever greenlit this game to be launched in its current state should not only lose their job but hand write apologies to all who bought it. The end.
---
OH and the game sucks if you didn't catch my drift. 
---
Thank you definitely will!!
---
Did you ask to speak to their manager?
---
Which leads to the very entitlement I'm referring to. I want those legendaries too but like I said, if I miss out, there are plenty of others out there.
---
I'm fine with us disagreeing as to whether or not it's a dick move. On your admission alone, I can't see how we can disagree that there isn't a sense of entitlement to those legendaries.
---
Give this redditor a cookie! He hit it on the nose; even if they have developed a way to monitor inventory, it was added on after the fact, and Beth's track record with that type of addition/changing in this game has been horrendous. 
---
And now, their fallout site is down as well.
---
I know how it works. That was the entire point of the ‚Äú/s‚Äù at the end of my post. Maybe I‚Äôll put it in bold next time for ya. 
---
Trust the plan.
---
You are right! Bethesda isn't capable of making mistakes or LYING!

Tell me sweet little lies

---
Many ppl had this issue so, yes. Now go talk shit on some other post
---
Ah the powerful lamp. 
---
Can call forth the Mothman, and keep the Grue at Bay. 
---
what micro transactions?  Ive been playing since closed beta and have no idea what you mean?
---
Looks like the Adventure mode UI option that we mentioned in our [article on Survival mode](https://bethesda.net/en/article/1PnLPLl6a8D6gPNWvSVA0Q/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-24-2019) decided to go on an adventure of its own! We're aware of this one and looking into it. Thanks for your report!
---
idk i prefer cavalier. With sentinel standing still means no moving. you cant aim around you cant shoot no jumping literally stand there and do nothing if you do anything you lose the benefit. also if you get hit in rapid succession you lose the benefit because ur char moves with each hit. I've also tested all of this
---
It ultimately makes no difference, because other players can open/close your shutters.
---
I'm with whoever pointed out the irony of how we spend resources to build these wasteland houses, and for some reason, we shatter all our windows.
---
FYI: *You* don't care that people may have been unfairly banned. 
---
They may be confined to it's relative zone. 
---
Luckily Steve, the Mothman's cousin lives in the bog....
---
Thanks a lot. This has made it a lot easier for me to set my prices for buying and selling camp plans 
---
If you had proof you had less than 100,000 items you could probably use that and get them into trouble. 
---
Jk hope you are able to login again someday 
---
Many people had the issue where they ‚Äúfound‚Äù duped items in some random container?!  Go smoke some more shit yourself.
---
You might be playing the wrong game, fo76 has no clan feature &amp; there is nothing to do.
---
They arent going to ban people for owning duplicated items considering some of my gear I'm sure was duped and I still have after the purge. While I'm sure some people are getting banned out of error I am also equally sure that many of the post with people saying they got banned for no reason are not 100% fact. If they can tell what items are duplicated then they should just remove them it is clear they arent able to and simply just movied all but one of large amounts or any given item that fit into there criteria.
---
Fix it good is for armor and power armor, not weapons. I think you're thinking of weapon artisan. It allows you to repair weapons to 200% condition.
---
You're a liar.  
---
I bought a powerfist from MODUS that someone else sold and you banned me for it.  I've literally never done anything to cheat and a simple look at my account would prove that.
---
Account:  TheHexi
---
Prove me wrong.  
---
Bethesda isn't capable of making mistakes or LYING! - Bethesda White Knights!
---
IMO easier to just do a quick run to Camp McClintock as needed. No bad guys = no bullets and it's not hard to pick up a quick 4-5 ammo bags and another 2-3 military duct tapes in maybe 3-4 minutes for at least 10-15 BF.  More than enough to repair 2-3 armor pieces.
---
Doing an asylum run you have to take out the parking lot, risk running into a daily quest in progress (Hello Mr. Scorchbeast), and then you've got to clear out the asylum which means clearing out a number of charred ghouls which is going to do more damage to your weapons and armor and waste ammo. The cost/benefit isn't there IMO if all you need is ~3 ammo bags to fix your left leg armor.
---
That's my point, what good side quests should I run to lvl up a bit before I continue on main quest?
---
Best of luck.
---
Name checks out.
---
&gt; At some point you have to use occum's razor and apply some critical thinking, is it more likely that a group of cheaters organized together and decided to make tons of posts about wrongful banning
---
I find it incredibly likely that a service provider that logs delta's out on the back end can reliably detect not only who duped items but also those that received those duped items.
---
Thanks much! I'll try and run this one!!
---
dude also uses 2 accounts to trade stuff between them. So it's likely more than 900 hours... 
---
The issue is both are likely. Cheaters lie about not doing anything after they‚Äôre caught and banned alllll the time and also post about it to try and get ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù or feel better or whatever.
---
Bethesda also makes easy unforced errors frequently. 
---
The correct way for this to be handled is for anyone who feels unjustly banned to file a ticket. If Bethesda notices too many reports and investigated and finds a problem, great. If it‚Äôs all a vocal minority of cheaters, eh. 
---
What we should not do is go on a massive ‚ÄúOmG FuKk Berthersdra im inn0cEnT!‚Äù community sizes rants. There simply is not enough info to support that, and if we do, we risk doing that on the word of what could just be a pack of lies. Like all the other incidents like that on this sub.
---
TL;DR1 Relax, people. File tickets.
---
Must be a good one, thanks for the input!
---
Lol I'll give you that one
---
I'm 51, literally scraping fans clipboard to get springs and never had a 1,000 let alone 100,000 of any rare item... so how people are all getting the same login error and ban has to be server side  
---
[https://imgur.com/mklmf8p](https://imgur.com/mklmf8p)   
---
Oddly they let dupers keep one item per their own response and not ban them??? 
---
Don't worry, Bethesda will find a way to screw you up as well.
---
And we won't give a FUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
---
Or the complaints are real and the reason there's a chain is that people see the first one and think "hey that's what happened to me I'll post too"?
---
No.  They are just weird.
---
I'm not sure anyone has really quantified what's happening, but somewhere early on, there was a nerf/cap relating to just how many resources you can reap from your CAMP on top of the stated rate of collection.  It's the same way you can plop down several Industrial Water Purifiers, go away for a bit, and come back to find that some have 2, some have 1, and most have none.
---
Man I almost got killed by that thing and a few high level super mutants a few days ago. Legitimately ran for my life, as I had no stimpaks, and no ammo. Never again do I want to see that thing.
---
&gt; They arent going to ban people for owning duplicated items
---
That's literally why they banned me.
---
End.  
---
Mystress of Mysteries quest line is amazing.
---
Or a more likely scenario, bethesda isn't capable of running an online game
---
They don't let you it's all automated 
---
There are a couple of "community managers"... all game developers have them. Part of the business. 
---
Yes. I'm short to be honest. It may be off by a little since the pipe revolver and flare gun arent legendary drops but its close
---
They're both in there.
---
Yea go tell to the duper hunters too
---
that's a dumb question... What would you think if you found out how to duplicate items... 
---
"huh, must be part of the game"
---
GTFO with that shit.
---
I will never understand why people who hate a game will bother go on a forum specifically for players, just to complain about how bad it is. It needs some work. I knew it would need work, and that's why I held off buying it till two months after it released. But it has it's good parts and I think in the end with proper player feedback and dev tweaking it will end up a great game. Which is why I bothered to post this. Maybe enough people will see it, agree, and it will get some attention. Bethesda devs DO watch the forums and YouTube. You never know. And someone here might have a work-around for my problem. It's happened before.
---
I guarantee you it is not a lie.
---
There's one at the water park up north, that's the only interesting one I can think of other than the order of mysteries.
---
you don't have to do the quest or clear anything out outside, nothing follows you into the interior cell. as for enemies inside, they are relatively easy ghouls, the odd low-level wendigo and other misc mob spawn which aren't that difficult. because I am searching for a few asylum outfits to finish my collection, I server hop here regularly and in a 3-4 hour play through can go through less than 100 shotgun shells on a standard crafted combat shotgun and come out with endless supplies of ballistic fibre, screws, springs, plastic and other misc (every enamel canister is plastic and steel, and there's generally 50 of them a go). that place has been an invaluable resource to me from level 35 even up until today at level 83. to each their own, I suppose 
---
Hahaha! One day soon you will be prepared for the encounter!! Or maybe you'll have a few teammates with you to tackle the situation!
---
An announcement from Bethesda just for the point *clarification* would sure go along way.
---
This was something I started seeing about a month ago. It‚Äôs definitely a thing. 
---
High level players, who knew they were doomed to be banned, dropping either large amounts of items for new players, or giving them dev room items. 
---
On an alt I had not one, but three separate encounters with people wearing the assault ?marine (dev room) mask approach me and ask me if I wanted one. They‚Äôd tell me if I scrapped it, I could learn to craft it for my friends. 
---
(I knew people who went into the dev room. I knew people who didn‚Äôt, but took items from those people. They‚Äôre all banned. I told them it was stupid and that I wouldn‚Äôt accept anything from there. Good riddance. )
---
When I‚Äôd tell them ‚Äúlmao thanks but I don‚Äôt want to get banned‚Äù they try to tell me I won‚Äôt be, it‚Äôs from watoga or something similar. And to just take it. Then they‚Äôd drop huge amounts of colas or magazines and tell me to take those. 
---
I don‚Äôt believe this is players just being nice. This is players knowing they‚Äôre doomed trying to kill the remaining player base through Bethesda‚Äôs own means. 
---
I have 600+ hours in this game, but on a low level alt players are trying to fool me into a ban. My high level main? Never approached. But I HAVE seen people doing this to lower level, new players in front of my main. I try to tell them not to do it and some listen, some don‚Äôt. 
---
‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs talking about dude I‚Äôve been here since beta Bethesda doesn‚Äôt ban shit lol. Just take the cola my dude‚Äù ‚Äúok‚Äù 
---
Rip, guy. That dude just doomed you this week. 
---
I bought 10 stimpaks... and that's the only thing I bought, think that's the deal???? 
---
I really dont get why people here are so condescending when people have legitimate complaints.  
---
My three water purifiers vary from 0 to 2 water after leaving them alone for an hour or so. Just seems to be completely random / broken.
---
That's what I'm stuck on. I know I picked it up to complete the previous quest. However, I don't see it when I look in my inventory. There was a bit of weirdness after I completed the last quest - I got kicked off shortly after while I was at my camp. When I logged back in I was back at the building for the previous quest, but it still had it marked complete so I didn't think much about it. 
---
I'm so worried that the card disappeared from my inventory because of some wonkiness, but I have no way to get it again because I'm not on that quest! &gt;.&lt;
---
Not sure if this is what you are talking about, but I found this on a wall in behind safe

100,000 + of an item it says....

That's what I'm hearing.  That's just adds to my amusement at seeing walter white at a workbench.

By posting guides on reddit after playing for 900 hours.

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs an advantage. Being hungry and thirsty reduces your max AP so I always keep myself topped up for the well fed bonus.

---

I tried to but there were no interactions. :( I'm leveling up another toon, maybe I'll be able to pick up something about the process that I missed on my main. 
---
Don't forget to strip down to your filthy scuds!
---
I just assumed he's exaggerating. And if the premise of his entire post is based on an exaggeration, I'm not inclined to believe his account.
---
Probably more focused on producing content than eating/drinking.
---
I started a discord server about when the game released and it sorta blew up. Usually had 10-20 online playing in voice chat.
---
Then the nerfs started to roll in, and now the playerbase is dwindling so hard. It's sad, now our Fallout server is basically empty besides one or two people on or a small handful of people playing Anthem.
---
The simplest solution is usually the correct one..... So cheat deny it and this is the only place they can bitch and continue to deny it so yeah this sub is Occam's razor at its finest
---
&gt; My belief is that people see a level 450+ player trading with a level 2 character and immediately think REPORT HIM REPORT HIM REPORT HIM. 
---
That might‚Äôve been it. Sucks. Have you tried reporting it to Bethesda?
---
I‚Äôm level 74, shotgun main, and I don‚Äôt have that card at all. You‚Äôll be able to get away with rank 1 or 2 just fine. 
---
It's because they banned a shit load of players in the past 2 days. I'm seeing tons of banned posts and tons of posts about people playing on empty servers. No coincidence there.
---
Yes, obviusly those active members are false positives, but many people love to create this kind of posts, just to make noise. 
---
"People have lied before, therefore everyone must be lying about this and Bethesda can't possibly have done something wrong or erroneous." Good logic there.
---
https://giphy.com/gifs/1AIeYgwnqeBUxh6juu
---
Yeah I mean clearing the asylum is a worthy self imposed daily quest of sorts. But if all you need is a handful of ballistic fiber to fix your armor there are easier ways is all I'm saying.
---
Why can't it be both? *twitch*
---
It feels like all the reasonable people (that went, "yeah, the game is fun, but it has major problems") left and now this sub just has the fanatics.
---
He's saying you're lying.  The people that love this game are kinda acting like twats for whatever reason.
---
Bethesda messed up again so what else is new.  Send a ticket in for support or hound the CMs here.
---
Unfairly? Sure, whatever you say.
---
[they got me too](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as0aea/banned_im_the_900_hours_played_guy/)
---
They also read that customer service having to no way to replace items as developers having no way of reading or replacing items.
---
It's a common line from customer service that they can't replace items. First rung support doesn't have those powers and doesn't have the time or resources to do investigations in many companies.
---
Do you remember how many posts were made about the trade stealing exploit? Because there was never a single article of proof that it ever existed. And yet people were here, lying about it multiple times every day.
---
Normally, you would be correct. But in this instance, there seems to be a somewhat organized group actively spreading misinformation and discontent. The commonly accepted theories involve everything from simple Trolls to disgruntled YouTubers, but my personal opinion is that they're being paid by someone funded by a rival developer, probably EA/Ubisoft due to Anthem and The Division 2 both releasing soon. (Side not: Anthem coming soon seems to be referenced a lot by false ban commenters)
---
I know it sounds a little crazy, but this is the reality of current business practices, and there are proven examples - did you ever hear about Sony's PS4 red light of death right after launch? It only happened on units from a specific factory, I believe in China - after investigation it was discovered that a Microsoft employee had paid the factory workers off.
---
Sounds much easier to use social media, doesn't it? Nobody even needs a passport. 
---
Ya'll must be really enjoying the game
---
I'm still waiting on any reasonable evidence that this error is from a ban rather than a bug.
---
That aside, if it is a ban, I don't think Bethesda is to blame here. They're doing exactly what the community asked for and what any responsible dev would do, wiping out duped materials and banning dupers, and even those who profited by it, therefore contributing to server stress and damaging the economy. 
---
While you can try to make a case that you didn't know, I'd say 10k copper is pretty obviously the result of a dupe. Not only would farming that much take a ridiculously long time, there's no need to have that much in the first place. It's about as 'red flag' as you can get.
---
In the end it seems to me like a 'you should have known better' situation. This is no different to me than people who kept pulling on the grenades to farm xp back when that was an issue-- it's an obvious exploit. And if someone said 'isn't the whole point of the grenade trap to be disarmed?' I would point out that that is a terrible justifying argument, and the same applies to your reasoning here. 
---
In the end, I'd be more sympathetic if you weren't trying to blame this completely on Bethesda, and taking no responsibility for your actions or lack of critical thinking. Especially when you try to talk about not letting Bethesda 'take advantage' of us... weak, man. Very weak. This kind of transparent deflection makes you seem like the bad guy and you should remember that IMO.
---
Good luck getting resolution.
---
Ok so I'm "that friend"     
---
And it's been since the end of December since I've extensively tested this, but let me outline the  idea and methodology.    
---
(Disclaimer, going from memory)
---
In November /December when allot of my ModAuthor friends were still playing we aggressively "Power Gamed" trying to push the envelope.  
---
The Theory was SuperDuper would be effected by Luck, as it is in the luck tree, and this was while resource were still scarce and X-01 sets were still uncommon.  
---
We decided to test the theory on cheap and easy stuff, and then once proven / disproven craft the X-01 sets for the group.
---
**First Round Tests**  
---
Tests with a base 5 vs 15 luck, crafting Glowig meat steaks and blackberry juice seem to show an increase of successfully "Proc's" when doing 100' and 500 sets of both, with a 15 luck seeming to hit about 40'ish percent of the time.  
---
**Second Round Tests**
---
We had already figured out the Unyielding insanity, had stacked luck items to try and push it, so we stacked....  
---
Luck Perk total of 15 points. 
---
Unyielding x5 (and 2 luck pieces) for 17 points.  
---
Charisma Based Alcohol Perk 3 Points  
---
Day Tripper 3 Points   
---
Charred Sorchbeast for 3 Points  
---
= 36 Luck (I think we got it a little higher but can't remember how)  
---
Repeating the same set of tests, with the Luck perk points maxed out, the total number of steaks and blackberry juice hit the 60% (+\- about 5% points I think).  
---
**Conclusions**  
---
For us it seemed The luck boost did effect the SuperDuper Proc rate, so we maxed my luck and I crafted PA for the group.  
---
Getting back to 36 luck...  
---
The first set I crafted with this setup I Proc'ed on 5/6 pieces, so nearly a full bonus set.   
---
The second set I crafted was only 3/6 Proc's  
---
The final set, I'm pretty sure was 4/6 Proc's. 
---
That was months ago, and now I don't carry around an unyielding set, but do wear + luck or INT armor, and will buff up a bit before crafting, and generally will wait until I have 100 - 500 of something to cook / smelt / etc. beforehand to make the investment worth it with the understanding from the previous testing.   
---
**Before someone asks**  
---
Because it gets asked all the damn time, no we didn't video it, because we..  
---
-Aren't narcissists.  
---
-Play on PC so things don't record as easily by default.  
---
-Were doing the testing for our internal group, and didn't plan and sharing the data.  
---
-Frankly didn't care if anyone believed us because we didn't plan on sharing the information.
---
   
---
Again I've not tracked and tested this since our testing in December, so I don't know if anything has changed, but Luck did Previously effect SuperDuper
---
Same here. I keep my character topped off on food, water, rest, and song. Plus I use the perk card that increases the benefit of Well Fed.
---
Well, technically Bethesda feels they had evidence enough to ban them, then they cry on Reddit. 
---
So technically they are in fact the Guilty burdened with having to prove their evidence. 
---
One of the many reasons why many of us want private servers sooner rather than later.
---
when you log on as well if you don‚Äôt hit ‚Äúplay‚Äù and you do ‚Äúsocial‚Äù first, you‚Äôll have the option to join a server one of your friends is already on. You can also do this from the social menu mid-games (join someone on a server).
---
And yeah ... then you ‚Äúpoof‚Äù ... though it‚Äôs more of a ‚ÄúpooooooOOOOOOoooooOOOOOOOOOoooooooffffff‚Äù that takes a few minutes. Get a drink while it loads.
---
Reddit be redditing. You are guilty until proven innocent. 
---
I wish I had enough free time to do something like this... 
---
I mean I wouldn't, ever, do something like this...but I wish I had the free time it takes to do it...
---
MMO just means massively multiplayer online, which it is. Are you stupid?
---
What did you do may I ask?
---
What about when it's things like the clown outfit in the atom shop a week after it was released and it was several posts within two hours of each other?
---
You can buy them from the vendor close to The top of The World
---
TSE was balanced
---
listening to reddit isnt lol
---
&gt; A good script
---
But this is Bethesda, so...
---
I agree with this guy/girl, Bethesda doesn't makes mistakes and if they programmed an algorithm, we all know for damn sure it's going to work right.
---
I duped Nuka Colas. 
---
Don't you just love it?
---
If this causes my death, I shall curse your fake internet name.
---
It's weird man.  I love Bethesda and their games.  I gave 76 a shot recently but I'll pick it back up when it's fixed.  Nothing wrong with that.
---
But some people here act like if you dont suck off bethesda then your obviously a piece of shit who deserves to die IRL.  I dont get it.
---
Put in a ticket just now. I want to spam support tickets all day, but that wont help.
---
The same service provider that applied a patch to an old build and put it live lol
---
That was a great story! My first encounter with that Behemoth involved me hiding in the Starlight Drive-in and taking pot shots until it was dead. The second time I was significantly higher level (100+) and went the one located in the small lake SE of Whitesprings. This time it took two or three swings of my two-handed melee weapon and it was dead, nbd.
---
Sure, you all are innocent and that's why the servers are smooth and stable now even though there are nukes dropping and people doing events.Looks like you made yourself a nice alibi with that "9000000 hours dude i know everything in the bible, don't judge me". 
---
I would like to day I do have upwards of a thousand materials in some of the categories that I do collect daily. 
---
On a side note. Anyone need springs? üòÇ
---
Looks like his intelligence is maxed out 
---
Did you try the other suggestion of having someone in the enclave open the door for you? See if that updates the quest? If you're on PC or Ps4 I am a general and can open the door for you to try out. I am at work now and won't be on until later tonight.
---
I agree.  If you look around a lot of the alters you stumble across in the game, you'll notice a bunch of paper cups and boxes of rat poison
---
How do I hound the cms
---
Somebody here claimed that the rates don‚Äôt change by adding more plants/purifiers. That is, you‚Äôll get 12 water per hour total whether you have one purifier or ten, and 17 plants ready to pick per hour regardless of how many you have. Having more plants or purifiers just increases the maximum that can be stored while you‚Äôre away.
---
I can‚Äôt confirm any of that, but it does make sense in my experience.
---
If its a script running it can go wrong in any number of ways, as seen several times by Bethesda themselves with prior patches. Not saying they are innocent but also not going to jump on the yOuR a DuPeR train that seems to be common, plus that is getting old to see. I have to believe that some of these people probably are legitimately innocent. But thanks to Bethesda's tos they really don't need much a reason to ban them, they could on a whim or ban you from all online content. 
---
It must be hard, being that fucking stupid.
---
I think in another post he says he's on disability right now so he has nothing else to do. 
---
I agree.  From what I‚Äôm seeing these bans are not for duplicating, but rather for other infractions.  It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if this was due to behavioral reporting.
---
I don‚Äôt agree with the form letter Bethesda is sending out.  If you want to address specific behavior, then you have to state what it is.
---
Gamers should stop enabling developers who penalize players for their own broken software. 
---
Wow. That‚Äôs unbelievable. I‚Äôve just about lost all hope in this game. Banning people with no proof of the accusation is bullshit.
---
Ah right, dont wanna rub salt into the wound but todays daily challenge was to drink a nuka cola

I thought it was already survival mode
---
I think everyones best option at this point is to just play Skyrim together instead, 76 is so buggy and grindy that i uninstalled it. If it gets patched and becomes better like no man's sky I'll install it and give it another shot.
---
&gt;Now. You have banned the only legitimate player base left playing your game. I will be inputting support tickets non stop all day today.
---
I'm still not banned. 
---
Also, since the spring cleaning and ban wave, the servers have been the most stable i've ever seen. And i play since BETA. 
---
   The servers went to shit as soon as dupping was discovered and it went viral. The BETA days and even the first weeks after release were great for playing, it all went to shit by December. That says a LOT.
---
Well considering destroying turret farm bases is standard for most people, at least on this sub, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ‚Äòsome made up morality‚Äô. Morals become laws when the majority of society decides something is ‚Äòright‚Äô - and the majority agree turret farming is worthy of base destruction. Build at your own risk. 
---
Up vote i agree with u
---
I'm kind of hoping I get a banned message like people are seeing because I haven't even played the game since 1/12 (that's when I got my last achievement). So I'll know something is wrong if I get the banned email we've been seeing.
---
Like I really enjoyed what I played but their recent balance seems like it's trying to suck some of the fun out (upping repair costs and such) so I'll just play an actually fun game (like Resident Evil 2) until they get the game sorted, or until they release a content patch that gives me something worth doing in the game.
---
üòÇ
---
Look for the threads that say "bethesda replied" and you'll see the username there.  There a few of them and I'm sure if you sent them a message then they'll get back to you.  
---
Is that relevant? The man can have as much steel as he wants, he shouldn't get banned for it.
---
If you read his other post (near the top here) you‚Äôll see he‚Äôs currently recovering from some sort of medical issue and has pretty much been stuck in bed for a few months. Yes, this is what he is doing for the most part.
---
I understand completely. A while back my family was gone for a good 2 months. I watched everything on Netflix, Amazon and Hulu I possibly could - even went deep into Nordic cop dramas. I‚Äôm done w/ streaming. If I had that much alone time, I‚Äôd be all in on whatever game I‚Äôm playing at the time.
---
Maybe someone should tag the BGS folk and we can find out if it's a mistake or he did do something wrong. 
---
Can you smell without a nose?
---
Sounds like a cool one! I may try this one first.
---
Well I've yet to be sent proof by bethesda what items I had over 100,000 of. My 900 hours played post and the comments I've made within it stand as my evidence of my love for the game. You have 1 side with a lot of detail and the other with an automated response. People think far too negatively far too quickly.
---
Your personal server experiences and personal discords aren't a good indication of anything. The FC discord is going strong, I'm in another one for building that is actively growing, and my servers still have the same 16-20 people they've had since launch. I sometimes server hop for vendor reasons and every server I enter is the same thing, populated and frequently with nuke blasts people are farming. I can jump 10, 20 servers and see this situation repeated over and over.
---
I'm sure players are leaving, and some are joining, perhaps with an imbalance between the two in the end. But 'your game is DYING' based on such a trifle of evidence makes you seem like the boy who cried wolf. 
---
&gt; I was given like 6k nuka oranges once 
---
Oh, that seems normal.
---
I don‚Äôt see why a guy with 900 hours would cheat but maybe I‚Äôm being naive. 
---
I‚Äôve had 3 run from me, one I sniped...but one I dueled to his death
---
I like to imagine a banhammer squashing the cheating cockroaches...muahaha, let the sweet tears flow !
---
Assuming this is legit (scrutiny is necessary due to this subs history), did this just confirm that there are still dupe methods in the game?
---
If it is the same guy as another post I read, he was injured or something, and off work on disability so has been playing fo76 a lot. 
---
Ah, the ever-shifting narrative of this sub. If you get banned and complain, Bethesda totally has proof that you cheated and you're a big fat liar, but if you play legit and just play a lot, Bethesda is totally right to ban you because you played the game you purchase with your money too much and you need a break.
---
I'm gonna bite the bullet and get Anthem this week.  I have a bad feeling about it but I want to be iron man damnit.
---
I saw your post, and it seemed kind of strange at the time, like something was off about it.  Apparently people started getting banned a few days ago, so it makes me wonder if you weren't banned before making the post?
---
Honestly, I hope not. I thought how cool it was that someone was able to keep themselves entertained in this game for that long.  I certainly couldn't. 
---
I wish I could thumbs up this more! Hahah
---
Yea bro I just got my email too. 350 fucking hours wasted because bethesda fucking false tagged my account. I know for a fact that I never had anything in excess of 10,000. I think this does it for me honestly man I loved the game but they shit on the only people who fucking support them.
---
Uninstalling today‚úå
---
&gt;I will be inputting support tickets non stop all day today.
---
Just so you know every time you put in a new support ticket, the older one gets pushed off and the new one gets put in the back of the que. This is common practice for CS.
---
Sure I'd love to volunteer my account as an example. Hell they can publicly post every single thing I've looted in the game if they can do that.
---
I literally threw nothing away, classic MMO Hoarder (there are wiki articles about mules in MMO games).. 
---
Hell I didn't vendor a single legendary until the end of December, had thousands upon thousands of Legendaries and did a breakdown of drops, and posted my "Seeded RNG" theory based upon the patterns I saw as a result.
---
The funny thing is that actual glass windows in Fallout 4 didn't protect you either.  You could shoot through them, and be shot through them.  I was assuming Fallout 76 would be the same if they actually do add glass windows finally.  
---
Still don't understand why they opted for empty frames in the first place.  Like, seriously, what's the point of a window frame if there's no glass in it? You waste time building a hole in the wall and have nothing to cover it, that's some silly house-building logic.
---
Anthem dropped for those that are signed up on the week early release thing. And Apex dropped that is consuming a lot of ppl's time and attention.  That Metro game and New Dawn game all came out also.
---
I don't like shooter looters with the primary focus on run and gunning type of gameplay, or battle royale games. I like 76 for the exploration and building.  But I think the overlap of players that like those kind of games and were interested in 76 for some of that action have their attention on all these other titles that came out is why.
---
Why defensive? I am honestly curious and thought maybe I missed something that would require so much steel. You put it out there now you don't want to talk about it?
---
uh you mean, except like other good quality games of which there is no shortage.
---
This happened to me once back in December. I distinctly remember thinking, WTF is this. Then I never saw it again and forgot about it till this post. 
---
What day is the patch going live?
---
It‚Äôs hilarious and a little sad that the /s is not at all necessary on that comment. 
---
I'm 109 and I've prob never even hit 10k steel, how could you have 300k?  
---
Lvl 161 here. Happened to me a hour ago. I don't think I've had 100000 items total. Never duped or known a duper. Ridiculous.
---
In my post I detail that I'm off work injured. 76 is kind of my life right now. Why would I cheat in a game that's literally saving my life.
---
W-WHY?!
---
Those charred are fucking horrible there. I remember going there to get some sort of shite. 
---
Maybe because of mule accounts? Not sure if Bethesda endorses them.
---
Thanks, not banned yet, but 2 friends were hit in the last couple days making me nervous..  
---
I mean FFS I have hundreds of fluxes on my mules etc.. (Not tens of thousands, the dupers casual range) and worried it's a matter of time..
---
Thank you!! I want to stalk n kill other players all day. It never gets old!! Seperate servers are the best solution in my opinion
---
Similar thing happened to me 2 months ago but the dupe overwrote my excavator armor. Haven't had excavator armor ever since. R.I.P excavator armor.
---
The criteria, AFAIK, for the bans are getting thousands of "rare" items in a 30 day period. They aren't banning people just for touching a duped gun or something. It's the people with 100k of the rarest nuka colas of which there probably aren't even a thousand on the map at any one time. Like no, those obviously aren't legitimate. Oh, you found 8k on the ground? Obviously not legitimate. Why are you taking obviously duped items when it's been known for months that duping has taken place?
---
Also, Beth said only 1% of the player base was being targeted. So for them to ban 1% of players and have this many false bans.... Even if they messed up HALF the bans, that's 0.5% of players. And Reddit doesn't even begin to represent the entire player base, so to have so many Reddit users be the ones who were banned (and banned unjustly at that) is highly unlikely.
---
But your argument of "Bethesda BAD" is compelling.
---
this is true. more purifiers only benefits people who are away from camp for extended periods as they act as storage and not as production. the amount specified on the purifiers is a hypothetical based on you taking each water out as it's produced, that is how much you will yield per hour. the difference is they each have a cap on how much they can store at one time (small is 2, medium is 3 and industrial is 5) once they reach that cap they stop producing altogether. so the benefit to having more is the purifiers wont stop when they reach that amount in one storage, they just start storing in another which results in weird and sporadic amounts in different purifiers.
---
 as for the plants, I think it's related to cell refreshing. go out and explore and come back so the cell has to refresh for you and generally you'll find the plants have matured enough to be harvested 
---
Have fun in your moms basement my man
---
He was probably trying to give u something.....theres no good way to get someones attention for that.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I may have enough springs to make you another set
---
I highly doubt the "paid trolls" idea, considering how wildly uneccesary it is for that to be true.
---
People don't need to be paid to troll. They do it plenty on their own. 
---
I‚Äôve never seen him but I can‚Äôt wait to find him 
---
I think this might be a bit of fallout from the item manipulation they performed the other day playing with the servers maybe?  
---
On the day of the patch my items were a bit buggy (radaway turned unusable, had no icon in the pip boy and when "inspected" showed a .308 round, they later "duped" and I had 2 stacks of radaway, 1 real and 1 like I mentioned, then later they disapeered and it went normal again)  
---
So maybe the server has flagged some people as having over 100,000 of any random item and its auto banned these players by mistake.  
---
Best bet is to make Bethesda aware that this is happening, they would be able to look and see if people are getting wrongfully banned or not and can resolve the issue if it us the case
---
Gamma Gun 
---
You put too much trust in redditors. People here probably used the dupe exploit and then advocated for its removal so no one else can use it.
---
Not sure about mules.. I will have to look that up. Seen it mentioned a few times but didn't want to ask..lol
---
Maybe. I am not sure. I was under the impression that he was trying to get me to fight him. I dont usually give gifts to the people that I fire-bomb, but different customs here, I guess. Lol
---
Prepare for Fallout Battle Royale
---
Why not? 
---
In the world of written messages on a board I think it would be best if you clarified the intent of your question there, then, because given the general state of this subreddit, it's extremely easy for me to assume you're just being cheeky and either questioning the legitimacy of his gains or questioning his playstyle. So I apologize if I sounded aggressive and you were just being curious.
---
I am pissed man ,really pissed ! Unlike many others,i paid full price for this game and the last 2 months i had nothing but SHIT servers ! And now after their little spring cleaning and huge ban wave i FINALLY get stable servers. At this point i really dont care anymore, i just hope banned people stay banned so we never go back to that shit that was before.
---
I don't know if people were doing that over a month ago. Maybe... would have been real close.
---
I tried to build my camp up there a while ago but it bugged out and all my items spawned about 3 metres in the air so I gave up
---
So a player picks up a bag from a dead player (your mechanics) and then gets banned for it. I've already uninstalled and submitting for a refund for my tricen. And power armor editions..... just lost a year's long faithful customer
---
There's people who tag 10 at once with a Tesla Rifle, taking 2  percent of their health and letting everyone else do most of the work. And you are arguing there's a serious difference between that and not tagging them at all. That's not something that I can take seriously. 
---
It wasent normal. And I submitted a ticket to them like they want us to and they took them away. Exactly. What. They. Asked. Me. To.do.
---
Because Bethesda can do no wrong, ever. Got it. Let me just review that code regression that snuck in last patch as a starting point.
---
I have a 3 star stalker‚Äôs rolling pin! 
---
* +100% VATS accuracy if not in combat at  +50% AP cost
---
* Reflects 50% of melee damage back while blocking
---
* +1 strength 
---
And here we see another instance of someone telling another person to play something else because clearly they aren't enjoying the game they're enjoying.
---
Yeah but you technically are 100m away from it strait up so "out of the range" of the marked bit, its also laggy as hell up there for me
---
Try this
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aq9y8m/vendor_plans_master_list_work_in_progress/?st=&amp;sh=
---
This is what I was typing,   you hit the nail on the head on both accounts.   I have tested it.  
---
I was level 106 when I stopped playing and I reached 30k steel several times, and each time spent it all on making .50 cal bullets or trading it to my friend who needed to make .50 cal bullets in exchange for 5.56 or other ammunition.
---
Turn your disappointment into caps! 
---
It also gives a legendary just a heads up, sadly the best way to level if you want to keep the rewards for later is random events and grinding
---
Look, I feel sympathy I guess because maybe you shouldn't have been banned. But in the moment, when someone is offering you 6k Nuka Colas, you didn't think "hmm, this is odd. Maybe I shouldn't take this."? What need would one even have for that many? You weren't forced to take them.
---
This all reminds me of the guy a few weeks ago screaming and crying about how he had been banned but never once duped.
---
Except for the one time he duped. He actually said that.
---
lol... I scratched enough together to finally build my X0-1 PA... now I still have to hunt for them to repair it later on...
---
If u drop the garbage in a rift yes, otherwise the items are still in world and need to be accounted for.  Otherwise the game despawns uncollected loot after some time. 
---
Unyielding armor gives you 15 more agility perception and luck. No matter what build it is you bring up, regular armor will always be able to do it better. Hazmat suit=gimping yourself
---
Been playing the early access. If you can put in about 40 hours in a month and aren't sure, try the origin access sub for 15$. Endgame gets kinda grindy and hard to get the legendaries you need atm, but the process of getting there was a blast.
---
‚ÄòThat dude‚Äô didn‚Äôt screw them over, Bethesda did. 
---
New players can‚Äôt be expected to avoid a high level handing out items. That happens *all the time* in MMOs. 
---
The seeded RNG or something else?
---
Shot we‚Äôve been found out shut it down release a new power armor skin to cover it up
---
My brother and I both ran into a lvl 304 guy in this nuka cola power armor. He dropped some TSE weapons and gave us a thumbs up and left. We grabbed them and used them and then the patch came nerfing them. Was pretty neat because neither of us were melee and that seems to be the only build you can use now. Anyway, neither of us have logged in since the most recent patch breaking alot of stuff and seems like that won't change. 
---
Let me guess...
---
It only takes me about three seconds to switch to a different Reddit account so there's that.
---
Here, and If I remember correctly it was the people with TSE weapons that were crying
---
Where does someone store 30k steel? 
---
I have about 200 hours in the game, work full time and have a life. Why is it so unbelievable that someone who is home because of health issues wouldn't have been in Appalachia 900+ hours.?
---
So what‚Äôs the point of looting everything from a corpse? 
---
Kool-Aid should come out with a "Rat Poison' flavor so cult leaders can pull wacky pranks.
---
Yes but not this one, much less story and one way linear quests are not the true fallout way. 
---
wow. Holy fuck.
---
A person who has played for 900 hours and a person who has used duping exploits aren't mutually exclusive.
---
Even when they release paint jobs for the excavator armor, I'm not sure if I'll use them.  
---
The yellow makes me feel like I'm Ripley driving the loader in 'Aliens'.
---
You got this generic email: [https://imgur.com/mklmf8p](https://imgur.com/mklmf8p)
---
Per Customer Service via Bethesda per their Twitter account they say to respond to that email even though it is a no-reply email account.   
---
the ban says it will be looked at when the game is patched next.   
---
People who have submitted a ticket Friday still haven't gotten replies yet. There is no chat or number to call.
---
random events and grinding, good to know - that's sort of what I was looking for , how to get the better rewards later when I'm higher level - thanks so much!!
---
I've played every day since release for an average of 9-10 hours per day. Yesterday was the first full day I went without playing. I'm worried that when I get my account back that I wont care anymore. Even with all the other garbage, I still cared about 76 and bethesda.
---
The "bans" are hitting people that deserved it as well as people that didn't. Even if you picked up items from a bag and later thought better of it and discarded, you probably got "banned." It's not for cheating, it's for falling under an umbrella of pre-determined factors that MAY imply someone cheated, but is unspecific and biased enough to net plenty of people who didn't actually exploit.
---
I think it just shows further that they have no idea what they're doing. Cheater or not, "banning" this large of a segment of their current players is going to be bad for the game overall.
---
And before you say, "no it's just a suspension until they can fix," that's assuming they can fix it to begin with. They obviously don't know how. They aren't taking the time to actually prove exploiting, they are merely looking at all the players who picked something up, even if it wasn't intentional or was discarded. In this case "ban" and "suspension" are nearly synonymous since the suspension is indefinite. And, if they do lift it, it'll be long after said players have moved on to their competitors' products.
---
The amount of drama around this game is so insane. The real game is the meta game around the drama of this game. My mind is full of fucks every time I visit this sub 
---
Yeah, I've heard good and bad. The demo was fun outside issues. I've heard the loading screens are just as bad as they were in the demo. Plus no one I know is picking it up and I made the mistake of trying to enjoy The Division 1 solo and didn't end up doing much end game stuff as a result (don't really want a repeat of that).
---
Just the impression I'm getting is that like it has a few fun gimmicks (flying and power combos) but the rest is so shallow/boring that they can't really make up for it that much.
---
yeah i realized that pretty quickly. I made 1 and plan on updating it if they keep rebuffing me.
---
They don't. Ever since the beta I've been running around with all weight reduction perks I could get, and carry weight upgrades. I usually carry around 900 lbs of condensed items on me, which become roughly 3500 if I take off the perks.
---
Shit we‚Äôve been found out shut it down release a new power armor skin to cover it up
---
Shitty range and the scope is eh.. I would take my rifle over that any day without explosive too. It seems many want these 2 shot or 1 shot (explosive) weapons are usually the ones that say they're bored right away, ya think..
---
In my opinion nothing, I dont agree with the op other then it removes those items faster then if u waited for the game to remove them.
---
It doesn't stop respawns, if another person zones into whitesprimgs the golf course respawns whether there is 0 or 1k dead ghouls lying around with junk in them.
---
When is the patch? Can you do more than copy and paste? Fucking embarrassing.
---
How similar to destiny is it? I get a massive destiny vibe from it.  
---
At least now you can take a shower and stop being a no lifer. They did you a favor

Would love to buy! Are you selling? My psn: ryanburns003
---
The ban for 100,000 involves user reports that they then check on 250,000 and above was automated, that means they check this guys account after user reports and banned him... 
---
so i just have to wait for the next patch? well its better then not getting to play again i guess
---
XD dying game, get rid of the very small players still playing it while leaving the bugs still intact. 
---
I imagine we‚Äôll never know how the server flags ‚Äú100,000 items.‚Äù Is it over the course of several days, where each instance of the item entering the player‚Äôs inventory is recorded? Because it‚Äôs doubtful, with the new carry weight limit, that any character currently playing would be able to violate that rule.
---
I‚Äôm a builder/trader in fo76. I‚Äôm constantly running from scavenging missions to other traders. The sheer volume of things I trade would easily flag me, if their method works that way. I‚Äôve been busy with exams, and haven‚Äôt logged in since Friday, but I‚Äôll give it a try tonight and update this post. I‚Äôm a legitimate player who‚Äôs legitimately concerned. That itself should be a message to Bethesda about the lack of trust their community has in their ability to manage this game.
---
Bethesda, the last thing you need right now is to give your remaining players any reason at all to worry about their account. All the duping fixes in the world won‚Äôt matter if you end up banning the wrong players.
---

No one got banned because someone reported you. It isn‚Äôt that simple. They don‚Äôt just get a report and go ooh ban him must be true, they will know how exactly you acquired the items and how quickly, I‚Äôm not casting dispersions but let‚Äôs be honest it‚Äôs not a simple as painted here. 
---
I made the original guide post a couple hours after getting the first 4:8:2000 error. I made the post literally because I finally had the time, because I physically was unable to play fallout 76.
---
Give OP a break everyone. His Daddy was an insurance investigator in California whose job was to deny claims connected to the wild fires. Just like his papa took to saying those house fires really started by people smoking in bed and were totally unrelated to the surroinding carnage, OP is now saying that despite Bethesda raining down garbage on its player base with every decision it makes, it somehow must have gotten this right. He's simply following in his father's footsteps.
---
But hopefully most other people are well aware that Bethesda no longer deserves the benefit of the doubt.
---
I don't see why someone with this many hours would cheat
---
Good luck to you
---
P.S. If you did cheat... maybe got into the secret room, or duped something, just move on man that many hours is not healthy... hopefully you got a standing desk, took care of your health and relationships and family and so on. Good luck.
---
Have done this actually! Nothing happened. 
---
This was over a month ago, but a friend got a big bounty and then we hid in the monster room, to see if anyone could find us in the mine. It took actually two nights until we got someone who knew how to get back through the two secret passages. We won that battle, and nothing happened for killing a player by the monster or the alter there. 
---
That'll learn you for holding over 10,000 5mm bullets. ;)
---
Technically it says future patch not next patch so not sure exactly when that future patch will take place or if it is going to be the next patch. 
---
I wish you a speedy recovery my friend. Nothing sucks more than down time after an illness/injury. For me, Bloodborne and DS3 were my go-to games and I sunk a lot of hours into them. 
---
I hope Bethesda fixes their mistake- it seems that one can add "Banning Dedicated Players because they actually enjoy the game" to their litany of misdeeds. Unfortunately, due to the state of 76, they won't have the opportunity to make that miatake too many times.

I get that to an extent, but from personal experience ultracite ammo is only slightly better than regular ammo, the issue would be when everyones running around with two shot explosive weapons which I heard were nerfed, idk though once again havent played in two months. Unless they buffed the hell out of ultracite, at the time it was pretty bad.
---
tell me lies!!!! 
---
It's very similar in progression with the gearscore and all that. Ammo isn't as much of a problem. It's closer to warframe in some aspects because it's all about ability spam and proper use of said abilities.
---
It's a new mode coming out with be restrictions pvp
---
Uno where I can get plans for those?
---
Yes I know that I was dump for picking them up but I went through the propper channels with Beth to get rid of them  submitted the ticket. Reported the person. All of it
---
Saving your life? Holy shit, wash your ass and go outside, holy shit. You're prolly growing mold
---
OMG!  Mothman Monday!  A new holiday!  Everyone post Mothman pictures every Monday!
---
For what it‚Äôs worth, I got banned for this, but I had the chance to appeal of course as part of the ticket... fast forward a month and a half later and that was me finally getting an answer to this ‚Äúappeal‚Äù basically they are suspending me too, but I was banned a month ago and not recently. It‚Äôs the same thing as such however they‚Äôve just suspended you now along with a MASS of others to save time issuing a perma ban/appeal/investigate/action 
---
Suspended or banned, it doesn't matter. What they did wasn't right. Bethesda should handle this better but they are just handing these out left and right. They need a better process on handling this. 
---
&gt; Reported the person. 
---
Well, that's snitchy. But I hope you get your account back.
---
You could say it's... *almost heaven*
---
I know on fallout 4 it showed how much you played but where can I find this xbox. Thanks 
---
Honestly  the idiots that run this game can go eat their own scrap, I love it, but those people are brain dead. Oooooo 800 fuckin stash. 
---
I‚Äôve had this same thing happen with my mix-mashed pile of 45, 51, and 60, and my friend with his excavator. The only solution I found was actually dropping it, not setting it down, and then getting into it and relog. 
---
PC....but thanks anyways.
---
I've got calibrated shocks on my T-60 so I'm okay with that.
---
Anyone else have this issue?  I have power armor but I really want the veil back.. I earned it .. what the heck?  can someone craft another for you?
---
It's hostile takeover 101. I guess zenimax isn't publicly traded, but you smear a company's reputation (nylon bag, unencrypted data, trade exploit, personal data breach) their price plummets, buy them up for pennies on the dollar, release elder scrolls 6, profit.
---
I could server hop and collect wood in the forest (with that woodchucker perk) and be up to 100k in a day or so..not that unbelievable 
---
I believe this is a duped nuka purge or duped mats purge. anyone that has been given a bunch of nukas or rare mats has got banned. the message is auto response. 
---
Yep...
---
One use for the gamma gun in this game: killing players directly or indirectly by healing the ghouls they are fighting.
---
When Whitesprings was at it's hayday it was the ultimate troll weapon :P
---
This is swarming fo76. I‚Äôm getting more and more worried about trying to login.
---
I hope they will never fix the duping and you cheaters stay banned. Knowing Buggedthesda, they can't fix shit. Hehe, enjoy !
---
Don't think that when people have lost items in trade, or noticed bugs with the trade system, etc. that it's not real, just because nobody paid attention and got a video of it. People have lost items. There are a bug with the trade window that was fixed. 
---
When people are leaving or threatening to leave a game they will always say the next hyped game that they are interested in. On WoW forums every new MMO that was coming out was the WoW Killer. It's just how people are. Don't buy the hype about any new games coming out. They spend more on marketing and hype than they do on development it seems. If they spent all that money on the actual game maybe people wouldn't be so pissed at EA etc. People seem to have short memories. Why do people keep buying these games? Sure the New Apex Legends is free to play and has millions of players. It's free. Duh. And yeah there are a lot of shills online. I hate it. They manipulate everything. Politics, news, even the food you eat. Meat and dairy industry shills pushing lies on people to support their industry of violence against animals.
---
Personally I love FO76, but I think Division 2 might be fun. Anthem looks boring. Outer Worlds looks good, but it's a little far away and it's a single player game. Not really in the immediate future. I like multiplayer, particularly with some pvp options. 
---
I mean in the ticket they asked me who provided them. I'm not going to lie
---
r/thathappened 
---
Right! Everyone gets the same email, no proof not even a mention of what the 100,000 rare items were. They say you'll get to play after the future patch... not next patch.
---
The very first time I played GTA online, a dude dropped millions in money bags on me. I knew keeping it may possibly get me in trouble but I kept it anyways fully accepting the risks!
---
Never got banned for it however but with have come in the forums crying if I did.
---
I agree, it's a bullshit argument.
---
I'm not sure how you trade as a lvl450 to yourself as a lvl2? Do you own to copies of the game and running them at the same time? I have an ALT character that is about lvl15 now and I drop some items I find over to that character, normally joined with friends and dropping in things like a trash can. I simply log out and then in as the other, but I don't have anything remotely close to to the number of items being mentioned. Sad to hear that you were banned.
---
Could you cry any harder? No one cares 
---
So what difference does it make , and also that is something that doesn‚Äôt occur a lot considering most players will want to pve , when you say that all players should get the loot regardless to wether they contributed takes away an incentive to even engage an enemy or help a player at all , and chances are you‚Äôll find more players just camping a spot and instead of ‚Äò10 people tagging an enemy at once taking 2% of their health‚Äô you‚Äôll have 10 players standing around watching.
---
Bethesda has been dropping the ball with this ban wave. They should hire better customer service people. They're doing a shit job.
---
Fair enough, at least I'm pretty open about my situation and not all "I did nothing wrong". I'm more so laughing at the absurdity of the situation, because only thing I had was a ton of bullets, while I know people who had much MUCH worse and are still playing. And even though I refused everything but the ammo I got hit when I havent even played in 2 months. I've quite a few friends who did the battle bot exploit that 100% crashed the server and they are still playing as well. The backwards stuff that the auto detection system they have is borked. 
---
I've played over 200 hours and I have farmed between 5-10k steel total. If I had played 2000 hours, which I don't think is humanly possible, I would still have only farmed 50-100k steel. So how is it possible you have 'several hundred thousand' without duping? 
---
I find this very hard to believe without some proof. 
---
yes the trade stealing exploit did exist it was in one of the patch notes for what was fixed.
---
Have my upvote ! It's safe to say that the servers are finally stable now ! See you next year!
---
I dupe the fuck out of shit and I'm not banned. Even when they deleted the super 2 shot exploding handmades they still left me with 7 or 8 of them. The only thing I really lost was my nuka colas. But all my other meds and crafting items stayed. What ever they're using to ban people is definitely screwing up other people and just driving this game into the grave.
---
My first character had 2k steel by level 25, so 10k steel isn't out of bounds
---
There is literally nothing against terms for having a mule. What is the difference if I play with my kid who is level 20 and give him weapons and ammo and stuff, or if I use a different character, give them stuff and then that account just doesnt get played much. It's not breaking a single rule to use a second account as storage. 
---
You should start an 'I quit' thread.
---
I've gotten a bomber jacket as a reward back in December.
---
Not sure where you got cheater from, though I highly doubt you are innocent.  Like me, I‚Äôm positive you have at some point inadvertently abused the doubly applied perk cards, duped something due to shit servers, copied your camp with metal doors, or participated in one of the hundreds of other ways one could cheat in this game.  You didn‚Äôt even read the OP, so before you go around throwing your unconsidered comments around perhaps your should investigate the situation fully.
---
Yea sorry man, but I code stuff like this on a daily basis, and I'm sorry to say it's impossible to make a mistake like this.
---
They'll be storing the transactions everyone makes, where the item came from and when it was created etc.
---
It's very, very easy to fill data like this into Elasticsearch and do an anomaly detection.
---
Have fun IRL while they cook up a patch and by the looks of it, you'll be let in again later :-)
---
Best of luck!
---
I logged in on first day, played around 5 hours, then realised it wasn't for me and installed 50 mods in Fallout 4 to play that instead. I'll probably come back in a year or two if and when improvements are made.
---
This makes a lot of sense, thank you
---
ive been off for 2 weeks now. less stressful when watching from outside. 
---
Ok bye üëãüèª 
---
True. But I guess my real problem is that I feel like Bethesda made enemies into bullet sponges  so everyone would have a chance to tag it in order to get the loot. 
---
I'd rather enemies not be bullet sponges and allow anyone who happens on the body to loot it.  
---
Dude their bans are automated, and false positives on these things are common.
---
I have no issue giving people the benefit of the doubt. 
---
But this is the internet, where girls are really grown men, the prince of Nigeria desperately needs my help with a financial matter and no one ever ever ever cheats in games...
---
So as we used to say "Pics or it didn't happen "
---
On your saves it shows total time played
---
Which quest(s) ?
---
Nope. NONE of that. I did buy from a vendor a cool weapon but back then i thought sometimes you get random legendary items at vendors and bought it.
---
He‚Äôs on disability leave and bedridden what else are u gonna do when you can‚Äôt go outside. 
---
no u
---
Check under the challenges tab. Look for the one that requires 7600 hours to complete.
---
I can see it happening. I played Fallout 4 10 to 12 hours a day, every day for the 2 weeks off I had due to prostate cancer surgery. You can't do much after major surgery so why not get in as much game time as possible before having to go back to work?
---
In other news: Bethesda kills off their dying player base even more with a ban wave after releasing multiple patches that broke more than they were supposed to fix. More at 11.
---
It does say rare items. Im completely sure Bethesda knows what they are doing.
---
NPCs can open them too, even the animals and insects.
---
Well, you got your money's worth.
---
I completely uninstalled. That feels even better.
---
After people lying and trying to spread hysteria about the alleged "steal items while trading" exploit that didn't exist and people saying they got banned for crafting items too quick, I'm now very cynical when on this sub.
---
God I hope I‚Äôm this lucky
---
Grafton station, but it took a lot of hopping
---
Dude open your eyes to how Bethesda has been conducting themselves over the past 6 months. If they actually got this right with no errors I would be flabbergasted.
---
They found out you were using boost mobile and banned you that's messed up man
---
I honestly think they should have a separate budgets for build, defense and resource collection. 
---
I would GLADLY volunteer my account to be publicly scrutinized if they have this ability. Post every single thing I've looted and everything I've done since day 1 of beta. Gladly without question.
---
No, they said above 250,000 was automatically directed by their system, the ban for over 100,000 was done by user reports and then they verified, every single claim being made was 100,000 item bans, which means they were verified by bethesda after user reports
---
May i ask why you were banned? 
---
Making bullets.
---
I'm not playing fo76. To only play one game is kind of sad though.
---
Bloke is recovering from surgery, I'm sure he's sorry for not going out and destroying his body immediately to appease some cunt who shoots off whatever bullshit comes to mind.
---
Halloween candy is a rare item. Xd
---
You should trust evidence because that's the only thing that matters, and it's sorely lacking in basically all of these 'I was banned' posts. 
---
Ok I will look next time I am on. Thx
---
So, you did, in all actuality buy a potentially duped weapon.  There you go.  You are now, by your apparent standards, a cheater.  End of story.  See how when you really look at things the tables turn and you gain perspective into how someone could be fucked over by Bethesda for a simple misunderstanding.  But besides that, if you had read the actual post you would know this is more about the future fo Bethesda interactions and myself focusing on the timeline for this patch and the question of proof from their side.
---
See you in 2020!
---
People say wild shit when they can't accept their own buyer's remorse 
---
I am a little scared to see how much I have played this game..lol
---
Even my account that has been used for nothing but an empty account helping buddies move stuff around got banned because one of them once moved over 100k ammo...
---
I wow, thought it was only me. I lost a 1* handmade for another this way.  
---
Same shit
---
I duped 2k Nuka Colas into about 20k 
---
Banned just for playing the game, that sucks
---
Sure I‚Äôd sell it. I‚Äôm gmaat3 you can send me an add and we‚Äôll link up later today. How‚Äôs 500 caps? 
---
Any more bullshit than believing they ban someone without any cause just because the person proclaims their innocence?
---
Why is jet made with mad cow shits
---
How do you know he was banned for duping?
---
The one where Freddy goes missing, it replaced my smg with the quest item, I‚Äôve did a lot of side quests yesterday so I also received a meat hook. I‚Äôll have a check of my camp soon and make sure I didn‚Äôt leave it in there. But I am more sad about my smg 
---
Don't worry: Apex Legends is a free game you can get into now!
---
I own 2 copies and play on PC. I dislike dropping items on the ground or in containers as my house just swapped to NBN (shitty australian thing) and we get frequent/random disconnects.
---
So I login to 2 different accounts, and trade stuff from my main to the alt account. My alts have about 1200-1400 pounds of junk in total across 3 characters and about 800 pounds of armor/weapons/aid/ammo.
---
Don't forget to post the other karma farm post "Can we all take a minute to thank x for their hard work!", tomorrow.
---
It's Bethesda tho. 
---
I know "injured" is a big word but look it up, dipshit.
---
My son was just banned with the same email received.  He bought nuka colas that were pretty obviously duped.  He was paying 5k for 25k nuka colas.  This is BS though.  He legitimately purchased the items using in game currency.  He was not the one who duped them!  Granted, I warned him he risked his account by doing it.  Hes 11 though!  
---
I also thought Bethesda patched duping.  So apparently according to this email from them, everyone receiving this ban is because they "duped" and once the dupe is patched then they are unbanned.  The dupes are supposedly patched though! 
---
I am a level 223 player.  Bethesda needs to do a full reset on all accounts!  Unban everyone! Let everyone start over at nothing.  Fix things that way instead of punishing people who did not do the actual cheating!  I realize there are people who will be upset with this solution, some who spent real money on in game items.  That is a clear violation of the TOS though.  A restart is needed!!!!!
---
All of this is hearsay, notes from people I do not know personally so I don't think I am going to be paying much attention to this myself.  if you want to get you pitchforks and torches (or flaming pitchforks for the technically advanced among you)  then be my guest, but I got better things to do.
---
Agreed, seems to be the quickest way to resolve these things, I cant remember their user ids otherwise I would tag them myself. Maybe if they respond you can give them your ticket number as well. 
---
Don't forget to post the **"Can we all take a minute to thank x for their hard work!"** tomorrow for the easy karma farm. 
---
&gt; They should hire better customer service people. They're doing a shit job.
---
That's been the case since November.
---
Not being able to track duped items doesnt make them unable to see what your current inventory is.  That is where they are getting the data to ban, people who duped guns or smaller amounts of items arent part of the ban, Its just those who have done obscene amounts of bobbleheads and nuka colas mostly.
---
Lol. "Decision is final' that's dumb when you didn't even exploit
---
thank you very much for that. I would have too
---
By chance do you use a mule account? It seems a lot of people who were banned and didn't dupe have a mule account. I wonder if that's the cause of the ban?
---
for curiosity, when did you do this?
---
I had this happen to me today. I did indeed have Radworms which I contracted immediately after login. I cured it, but I still couldn't jump high. I switched servers, and it was fixed. Seems we're getting Radworms at random times.
---
For those who it was false, It shoudln't have happened in the first place. It's hard to want to spend money on a game that treats their customers this way. Definitely won't be buying atoms for awhile.
---
Which is why I would LOVE for them to post which items I had or have had in the past that would cause this ban. I am fully open to being publicly open with my account. If they do store that kind of information, I would happily let them post my entire loot collection since day 1 of beta. I do not cheat.
---
Myron, the guy who invented jet, used brahmin dung to cultivate the fungi he needed to make jet.
---
Well, it's a good thing you were banned then.
---
Well it is kind of your fault, but is it a perma ban? 
---
Question is, is this the propaganda or the counter-propaganda? I can't tell.
---
thats it, thanks.
---
I'm not going to buy a game to get mystery banned based on what they think. I work too hard for my money to be banned based on their assertions that could be wrong like this guy's. I'm too stupid to know what I did was wrong, and couldn't tell them what they needed to know if asked. 
---
The armor and weapons he drops are also usually modified and thus valuable if you‚Äôre low on vendor fodder for daily cap runs. He drops a fully modified Assault Rifle for me every single time. 
---
its time to realize this is game and BGS are a simple dumpster fire.  take a wide berth and move on.
---
I was joking but good to see your up on the lore to a good degree fallout 1 and 2 were great games 
---
About a week before they fixed the crafting dupe glitch. 
---
That takes lead gunpowder as well shotgun you need plastic too. That's a lot of ammo.  Specially with ammo perk and super duper. Hmm.. maybe invest in aiming perk. IDK 
---
How dare this guy heal after from being injured!
---
Are you seriously this stupid? Learn to read you illiterate little shit.
---
Its 15k 5.56 ammo. I only farm super mutants and only use shotguns. It kinda stacks up after a few months.
---
I don't care if you believe me or not, this is effecting innocent people. I never duped never used an exploit. And I don't even have 100,000 of anything as they claim in the email. Their dup detection software is bugged, I know Bethesda has never had a bug in any of their software ever, this is definitely the first time.
---
Explain why the NCR is better than the Legion as a whole. I already know the lore, but I‚Äôm judging you as a person now. 
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/BjHcLAF](https://imgur.com/gallery/BjHcLAF)
---
And as for people questioning if the OP is legit, I see no reason why he is not!  I have spent about 500 hours in the game and I have 3 kids and a full time job.   With his level, there is no reason he would not have gotten hundreds of thousands of each resource over the last 3 months!
---
Your whole concept of 'contributing'  is kind of ridiculous.
---
Imagine there's a horde of 100 ghouls, two of them are legendary.  There's one guy who is fighting like hell. His 'contribution' not only keeping himself alive, but others as well,
---
But out of those 100 enemies, the only enemies that he fails to tag are the two legendaries.
---
 It's not only possible to 'contribute' while getting none of the best loot- it is actually very common. 
---
Girlfriend and I haven't played since the last patch. They nerfed my sneak build and bugged sneaking. I havent seen anyone say it was fixed. Girlfriend was sick of healing enemies when she uses a one handed knife melee build. Like the lowest damage you can do melee and they still were healing. 
---
I assume the game is just about dead now. 
---
I am assuming just touching them. They do need to release something though. 
---
He literally posted the message saying he's banned??
---
Never played the game but maybe it's because you have 20 pounds of power armor.
---
I‚Äôm positive there are dupe methods that still exist in the game, as well as other potential economy breaking exploits, including one theoretical free caps glitch that I won‚Äôt share or even test in game. 
---
Supposedly some people have gotten hit for ammo as well. 3.3k ammo per day, depending on your gun really isn't unreasonable in 30 days, esp with super duper and ammosmith. I can use that much 5mm in a single queen fight.
---
Yeah, Bethesda fucked up big time. They already got rid of the duped items. It's their fault that the dupe existed and was allowed to go on for so long. They shouldn't have banned anyone for duping, but instead let it slide for the fact that the game has been in a poor state. At least if they didn't ban the dupers (and subsequently innocent people too) they would have more of a playerbase.
---
I've duped stuff accidentally while trying to build a camp...never tried, never tried to replicate the glitch, never profited from it. On top of that, suffered from glitches where weapons and armor completely disappeared into the map...guess I'm a cheater also lol. 
---
700 hours and I was banned.  happened to me. All emails ive sent were Ignored. 
---
I was also suspended.  I have 100% never duplicated anything.  Level 182 with over 240 hours in game.  I play everyday.  Only have about 8 weapons, and my character weighs about 285 pounds at all times.  Only thing I craft alot is ammo.  After I server hop and farm for lead.  
---
It really sucks for all that time to go to waste . 
---
I won't be buying the game again and starting over because I actually really do feel i was wronged 
---
I'm not gonna say Bethesda is surely in the right here, but it is such a common thing for cheaters to come online and try to make the devs out to be the bad guys when they get banned. Most people immediately side with them for some reason. Recently, someone in the BF5 sub posted about how they were wrongfully banned with "proof" and the devs themselves commented calling them on their bullshit. Honestly it's just pure speculation from either side. I'm on the side that if you literally have spent 40% of your life on this game since it came out, that it wouldn't be surprising whatsoever if you're some sweaty duper who's full of shit and trying to get redditors on your side 
---
I'm married with a full time job and I have about 250 hours logged since November.
---
Plus, in addition to folks being unmarried, uncommitted and on full time disability, some people are under house arrest or probation. I have an old friend who was on probation for two years and playing video games was his main distraction/activity since he was indigent. This is another group of people who can literally spend 12 to 14 hours a day, every day, playing a video game. 
---
Someone spending all their free time in this game could easily reach over 1,300 hours of gameplay since release and that doesn't even include beta play.
---
It states rare items. You should read before posting. Even if it wasn't on rare, who is going around storing up 100k+ wood? Never a dull moment.
---
I have a ghoul Slayers, swing Speed, +1 str rolling pin but i have to check if those are correct
---
From the way [it‚Äôs worded](http://magaimg.net/img/7b3i.png ), it doesn‚Äôt sound like it. But I‚Äôm definitely guilty of duping so who knows?
---
Likely because you unequip all your gear when you go in PA. Your gear may have carry weight bonuses or strength bonuses that gave you 20 carry weight.
---
To be an exploit, it needs to be reliable and replicatable - and if it was either of those things, we would have seen the step-by-step instructions like we did with duping, disarming, battle bots, etc.
---
It was a semi-rare, unreliable bug - very similar to the Feed The People processor bug. And yet people blew it up and said "don't trade or they will steal all your weapons!" That whole panic was seriously ridiculous lol
---
Do you have pocketed armour? Because PA unequips your armour when you enter it. 
---
Yeah, I thought I‚Äôd post to see if it was a common issue, seems to be the case. I don‚Äôt think Bethesda would be able to help us get them back though tbh. But that smg was myfave. 
---
Reading and math!? But that's harder than just saying stuff!
---
I don't think this post helps. While I'm skeptical of all the 'I'm innocent' posts, it's for one main reason: No evidence. And in this thread you're basically doing the same thing as they are, providing no evidence (though I understand that you've stated this is just your belief).
---
I think everyone needs to simmer down a bit.
---
I'll buy it!
---
i have 400ish fusion cores, and like 60 thousand nuka quantums, i got them out of a dropped bag, i was banned for "having more than 100k items in 30 days" this is apparently the metric they are using to tell if you dupe or not amount of items over time.
---
How the hell do you have so much time and how can you play non stop wtf üòÇ
---
Thats very sucky. Im sorry that is happening to you, hope you are able to get it sorted out. Were both accounts banned or just the one?
---
Bethesda....bethesda never changes...
---
They did you a favor.
---
Wow man I'm sorry to hear that,  I wrote a long response post in your other thread.....that's a real crappy way for them to handle this.
---
BtW support tickets will go to the wrong person, ask for any replies to have the issue escalated to a manager.
---
According to Bethesda, yes.
---
You lose any perks that are associated with your regular armor when you enter power armor. So, if any of your regular armor points grant you additional carry weight, your carry weight will go down when you enter power armor
---
 Is it weird that I only partly understand the whole story of fallout? Probably my favourite game of all time but I couldn‚Äôt tell you where all the factions come from lol
---
You can always find all robots rachel, nanny, two arguing etc if fast travel to Nicholson‚Äôs end it the west-south of ash heap. 
---
Follow the road east. 5 server hops and I met all robots. 
---
Rachel quest was bugged for me. No reward. Will try again some time. 
---
War thunder is better
---
They came for the hackers and I did not speak out because I was not a hacker. They came for the exploiters a I did not speak out because I was not an exploiter. They came for the wrongly accused and I did not speak out because I was not wrong accused. They came for me and no one was left to speak out. 
---
I am sorry this happened to you. I got banned as well. 
---
I really hope this doesn‚Äôt ruin the game for you, I truly enjoyed reading the the stuff you posted here on Reddit. I liked the passion you put behind it, it was easily to see you honestly enjoyed playing.
---
Although the NCR has its issues they try to establish democracy. They don't act like their actions are justified because *iT's tHe wASteLanD*. They also try to be as peaceful as possible. Sometimes it doesn't work but at least they try.
---
I think it‚Äôs an automated system doing the suspensions. I know serval people who have got it. And they never duped anything. They only traded and collected. Had mule characters to hold junk and stuff. 
---
I've gotten that a few times now, 5 I think.
---
Whereas I have friends who have duped well over 100k of nuka colas, and other things, and haven't been banned.
---
Bethesda has no clue what they are doing.
---
I didn't.
---
That's why I'm here
---
"My belief is that people see a level 450+ player..."
---
This is the problem. Your level is too high and now you're basically godmoding everywhere. I would say you have "beaten" the game and might consider completely starting the game over. Or just get another game. 
---
Just wondering what future update cause it could be the next one or in 6 months
---
Problem is they weren‚Äôt detecting players with over 100,000 only over 250,000 anything under that was done by user reports and then verified by bethesda.
---
What did yall use? 
---
Deal! 
---
Maybe doing some of the low level events as often as you can? Fertile Soil, Mama Dolce's, I think they spawn at least once an hour, and offer a couple hundred EXP a pop. At low levels, it would take you a while to accumulate that much EXP from low-level scorched and creatures. 
---
Outside of that, there are usually a fresh batch of enemies at a location whenever you first discover it, so each new map location on the west side of the map should give you a good batch of enemies. Morgantown Airport has a ton of low-leveled scorched as well. 
---
How much would you pay? 
---
Maybe you had 100,000 of those invisible grenades off super mutants...
---
Shit I have like 20k steel I may be fucked
---
Yup. And the message from Bethesda states that he had 100,000 rare items in his inventory in 30 days. So either OP is lying (or leaving out crucial parts of the story), or Bethesda made a mistake. Since I've seen a ton of these posts on this sub, and none of them have provided any evidence that they are true, I am skeptical.
---
lol.   
---
Like it is not likely that people tell lies on the internet? Like wtf is this your first day online?
---
For the record I never duped but did pick up a lot of nuka from bags. Not sure I should receive a final warning for that 
---
&gt;They should hire better customer service people.
---
As well as developers.
---
VINDICATION!
---
As an initial point, can we all agree that 99.99% of players across all video games on forums don‚Äôt admit to actually cheating? 
---
That said, you could be the rare exception.  And if so, that puts the burden on you to prove yourself. 
---
Bethesda has detailed their process, at least as it relates to certain volumes of items over a 30 day period.  
---
One way to circumvent a ban would presumably be to distribute items to an alt account, to avoid flagging auto detection.  
---
If I understand correctly, let‚Äôs assume Bethesda is tagging item acquisition and item retention, rather than merely item retention.  
---
If so, and if Bethesda caught someone muling numbers of items to and fro either account in excess of their limits, this ban sounds legitimate.
---
Your defense has to be: I did not acquire or retain X amount of items claimed in their email, and the algorithm and investigation are wrong.
---
Is that your defense? 
---
Done it in 1.5 after patch with randoms. Gotta get those rookie numbers up
---
He sold an item for nuka cola to exceed the cap limit and is now banned for receiving too many rare items. 
---
I accept this. Good job, buddy. Ad Victoriam. 
---
This is true. 
---
I'm also reliably informed that you can place the larger one if you remove the roof piece above it before you place it, then place the roof. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt, but there is zero possibility I acquired 100k of any rare item.  The ONLY possibility of any massive number like that for me is with ammo.  And all of that was from grinding out materials to make it in game.  Not a single round I have was bought or traded for through other players.  
---
Ad Victoriam
---
you might get a better reaction from r/fo76FilthyCasuals tbh
---
the problem with the TSE gauss is that it has very bad accuracy. Both shots don't hit the target that ur aiming at. It sucks with vats too for the same reason.
---
Single shot gauss rifle is far more superior.
---
I had one and used it for a good while. I ended up selling it for 3k.
---
That's messed up. I was someone who asked about how you swapped items to mules and your method was totally legit and not what this ban seems to be about...it's weird... I guess people could report a low level talking to high but even then the ban says 100,000 items... What if you snagged from a killed duper? So bizarre.
---
People having mule alts seems to be a common thread in those saying they were banned. Wonder if it's connected.
---
I‚Äôm still good. 
---
I'm on a quest of reading all the "I got banned for no reason" posts and comparing them.
---
I'm completely sure they don't.
---
To many people know how to counter the gamma gun now
---
I hope they fix the duping and the cheaters remain banned.
---
That didn't take long. Great job to whoever showed up and chased both of them halfway to Watoga. They just server jumped. 
---
The last time I killed him, his eyes were yellow while I snuck up to him, but they quickly turned red once he was aware of my presence. I did eat his eggs in an omelette aka, his unborn children though.
---
You read the post right? The guy's recovering and this is what he does. I've seen his posts before. He repeatedly said he'll give his account for scrutiny. I don't what more evidence you want. 
---
By chance do you have a mule account. I'm seeing a lot of these false ban peeps talking about their mule accounts. I wonder if that is getting you banned?
---
would be easier to count the people that are suspended. theres really not that many posts.
---
Any rapid fire heavy weapon with 1 gun army. Staggered sentinel=dead sentinel.
---
Computer says no.
---
I got a level action rife, I don't know what it does but you can have it.
---
That's cool that you tried, but kinda disappointing nothing happened.
---
That is indeed my defense. I have never owned any items in excess of 100,000. 
---
Unless experience gained could count as an item?
---
Curious if ban items used the same id# on multiples, and if its registering any item with that id# as a banned item. Meaning if someone had 100000 and sold it to a buddy and they sold it to you. It still came from the same batch with that id#. 
---
Not sure if that‚Äôs how it works though.
---
And a few duped Deathclaw gauntlets stacking bobbleheads and cheesing it outside of the nuke zone so you can run bloodied in your full set of duped armor. Maybe a few thousand rounds of duped ultracite ammo.
---
I'm sure innocent people are being affected in some way, that happens with basically every dev and every ban sweep. And I don't agree with this thread's tone.
---
The thing is, what are the rest of us supposed to do about this situation? It's a fact that ban problems happen and they're probably impossible to avoid, since humans don't really make perfect technology. The only thing that can be done is for innocent people to push back against Bethesda by mustering as much proof as they can and submitting tickets. 
---
Coming to reddit to complain amounts to nothing at all... it only stirs up bickering. Especially since not a single person I've seen posting about their ban here has provided any proof in their defense. I don't particularly care for word of honour when it comes to the internet and video game exploiting, lol.
---
I deleted my Bethesda.net account and never will buy a Bethesda game in my life again. Most incompetent shit Ive ever seen in my life, ok second most incompetent thing.
---
In regards of TES 6, ARRRR.
---
Honestly, I‚Äôd write the game off as a loss.
---
This appalling Bethesda behavior is going to keep happening- the question is do you enjoy the game so much more than other games that you want to fight through it?
---
The real budget is a lie. If you want an evenly lit base you are limited in your size options.
---
You can build large houses with a bit of creative work though. Top tip, the wall decor options which light-up, like the poster type signs, they seem to take less budget than objects from the lighting section of the menu.
---
So behemoths play golf.  I am surprised we don't see them at Whitesprings more often.
---
I saw word start up that legit players who have been on since beta getting these bogus ban emails and checked my email. Sure enough there it sat. I've had issues with some things in the game but the fun always outweighed it for me. What's most insulting is they gave dupers a means to appeal and get clarification in their first ban wave. Here they are now banning legit players giving them no appeal, no clarification. It's like a spit in the face. What worries me may is my back up game is usually FO4 or ESO. If the bs ban keeps me from playing those, I may swear off Bethesda for life.
---
I believe it is. Because a lot of dupers had nukes.
---
I had nukes but I bought sold and trade a lot on the reddit boards. And if I came across good deals I would purchase items. To sell or have to use later.
---
Now I know I had a lot of inventory of things on some characters So I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm going to get the suspension email also.
---
250 caps sound reasonable 
---
While I agree, level cap doesn't mean a whole lot in fallout 76. Think of a game like solitaire. Thats how I treat 76. It just clicked for me.
---
One more thought, read through the TOS and see if there is something that prohibits dual boxing (many games I've played prohibit it)
---
The reply that you had 100k of various items may just be generic and the ban may be due to playing multiple accounts at the same time from the same IP address.
---
A lot of the wrongful bans I've seen have contained players with mules.
---
Except my doors are locked..
---
Actually the person I responded to said "any item", maybe read before commenting a smartass response üòÅ
---
All that's left is the awkward positive posts since those are the only people left playing 
---
If you still need this in an hour I'll be then and will help you out.
---
Problem is I don't have 100k of anything not junk not nuka colas not ammo not even if you add them all together I simply don't have that amount of items. So of I don't have 100k I definitely don't have 250k. I know "people lie about cheating therefore you're lying" not everyone dupes. Bethesdas software is bugged. 
---
HE had a mule account in which he is exploiting the system to avoid weight limits and carry absurd amounts of materials and items.
---
Cant believe you got downvoted for the most legitimate response here haha.
---
In 76 power armour doesn't weigh anything while you wear it. Thank you though!
---
The game can‚Äôt count accurately 
---
I was rewarded with ‚ÄúMoneybags‚Äù  (Possess 10,000 Caps) for finding 7 Caps when I had 5,872 Caps.  I have the screenshot.
---
Now it‚Äôs possible that over time, I *acquired* 10,000 Caps, however at no point in time did I *possess* 10,000 Caps.
---
I bet the majority is still here 
---
some guy on here posted a Twitch video last night where he [solod it in under 5](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/382609335?sr=a&amp;t=390s)
---
Add me :)  Linuturk
---
Thank you. Hoping we can get some traction behind this and they figure out what went wrong. I am extremely worried that once I log back in, that I'm going to log straight back out and never play again. 
---
Fellow 900 hour guy here. I am only lvl 244, I have end game full sets of sentinel gear and unyielding, a large selection of top end bloodied weapons and other top end gear. Last night I solo‚Äôd the queen in 10 minutes, felt it could‚Äôve been much faster too.
---
Yet somehow you‚Äôre almost twice my level? Something is a bit off here, are you sure Bethesda didn‚Äôt find the off part, got something to hide?
---
&gt;Bullshit scenario 
---
&gt;horde or 100 ghouls
---
While this does justify it , I still don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre seeing this the other way round, which is the probable reason you have to tag enemies to get loot.
---
See it from the perspective of following someone around who‚Äôs actually fighting and then going in for sloppy seconds of loot when you yourself have contributed nothing, now put this perspective into events, dungeons , missions , boss fights.
---
Like perhaps you‚Äôre not even following someone around, presume you‚Äôve just stumbled upon the corpses of legendary enemies in which someone has completed an event for such as ‚Äòone quiet night‚Äô and then you‚Äôve got yourself a 3 star legendary weapon / armour because some other player did an event.
---
lastly ; if this was ever implemented my *bullshit* scenario would become a widely used tactic as to get good loot without doing anything. 
---
Well i didn't have any of that other than a bloodied 40% swing speed with +1 strength but i can get up 3k on it. Don't know what others had 
---
You know who was doing a lot of trading? Dupers. They might not have personally duped, but traded for duped items. If they ever accepted large quantities of stimpacks, nuka colas, or uncommon junk like springs, screws, fiber optics, or ballistic fiber they probably accepted duped goods.
---
The people want to know what's going on. I have yet to have this issue. I checked my email just to make sure and I have not had the email luckily.

---
Is there a difference you can pick out between someone lying and hundreeds of people collectively independently lying
---
high level players handing out shit ruins the game for new players TBH.  Stop doing it.
---
duped ammo too. just dealing with duped items. the ban wave hasn't even finished. People are still getting banned as up to an hour ago.
---
Off work injured and the game just really clicks for me. I think its VATS. Game lets me ignore the shitty parts of trying to recover from an injury.
---
i didn't, but i haven't played in months.
---
Still good
---
easy, i turn it off when i leave
---
Same here. Never duped. But did pick up free items from a duper... bit harsh to be on a final warning for their dodgy code that allowed all this to even become such an issue.
---
True true. I‚Äôm just kinda peeved in general at this point. Mb. Instant reaction without thinking.
---
Experience? No I don‚Äôt believe so.  
---
As it relates it items, did you mule quantities back and forth with neither account exceeding the limit, but with both accounts temporarily acquiring the items, in excess of the specific numbers, over that 30 days?
---
Example:
---
January
---
Account 1 has 20000 springs 
---
Transfers to account 2
---
Account 2 transfers back etc until 100,000 limit crossed on Account 1.
---
Account 2 does not get final trade, and thus stays at 80,000.
---
Hypothetical Result:
---
Account 1 gets banned
---
Account 2 does not get banned
---
You never acquired more than 100,000
---
But you flagged more than 100,000 quantity of items during this time period by virtue of a transfer
---
Is this your argument?  Or is this possible in your eyes? 
---
If you like Bethesda style games it's pretty ridiculous value for money given the prices out there.
---
If it gets its hooks in you, particularly if you like the base building and hunting down new plans, you'll be in for 100s of hours. I'm at 300 hours myself which is ridiculous for me given the timeframe.
---
Yes there are many improvements to be made, but from a value perspective, at this point it's really low risk and definitely worth taking a look at.
---
I wouldn't say "get rid of," I wouldn't mind some very limited PVP. Or like...a Battle Royale, the map would be interesting to try that on.
---
I bet they won't. They probably don't know/can't do anything about it. I think they send messages to the dev team with carrier pigeons too.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ I can literally taste the salt reading your comment. 
---
Of course you wont care anymore your exploits and mule characters are banned.
---
Read his other post, hes out of work with a broken scapula, yah it's a lot of game time but people watch 10 hours of TV a day all the time theres no difference.
---
Most of the people claiming false bans I am unsure of, the level of game knowledge evident from this person's lengthy farming post shows he really has no need to dupe.
---
While I agree having that much time doesnt automatically make him innocent, it's a fairly good indicator.  And with a banned account you cant log back in and take screenshots of your inventory so how do you expect these people to prove their innocence. 
---
Don't let silly things like facts get in the way of people pushing the narrative that tons of innocent users were banned...
---
Yeah, it's called sockpuppet accounts.
---
I worked at a big gaming company and from what I take from there everyone cheats. We had a guy with a lot of rare achievements, multiple server first kills millions in money - all legit. And then he started some botting tool "to try it out". Once... and permaban.
---
I am not saying you good sir are not telling the truth, I am however saying that usually Staff does not ban on a hunch or just reports. They have logs of things that happen and usually consult those - or have a script that does it for them.
---
Good luck however, hope this clears up.
---
Maybe it's for the best - better to exit this game now than watch it die...?
---
Take this time off to get your life together and do something with it. 
---
Bethesda should just be happy that *anyone* is playing this game. 
---
He did the math!
---
Wow this is an insult, they should be thanking you for putting up with their game for so long. What a slap in the face
---
Yeah, they've borked a lot of stuff but remember when the last ban wave hit and so many people were claiming innocence after the ban then promptly disappeared when Bethesda said they were full of shit? I trust the average poster even less. If they've temporarily banned people wrongly I expect them to say something about it soon... but my guess is these people aren't as innocent as they claim to be. I can't imagine an average player having 100,000 of any item, rare or otherwise.
---
In my several year experience  on Reddit, not once has a ‚ÄòWhy was I banned???‚Äô Post ever been made by someone who was mistakenly banned.
---
Don‚Äôt dup glitch. It‚Äôs easy for them to find out on their end if you have done it
---
I usually leave a maxed out a lvl 1 auto pipegun and a couple hundred rounds of .38 on one of the two corpses right outside V76 along with dupe plans...
---
Logged in earlier in the day.  Didn't get banned.  Literally playable!
---
Was honestly thinking that Warframe looks pretty good. I'm not big into pvp.
---
Everybody that has played Fallout76 has received duped items at some point no way around that.
---
There was even a post where dupers said they went around the game world on Xbox and PS4 putting Stimpacks,Plans,radaway and other items in containers letting people find them.
---
Going after dupers is good and okay...but make sure you get the right people.
---
ur friend was hunting dupers with duped weapons lol
---
Interesting. I knowingly duped items, just had one of each and gave the others to friends, and none of us got banned. 
---
I literally feel my arteries clog reading your your reply.
---
Beth's shitshow goes on... 
---
LOL got caught duping and is now threatening to spam Bethesda. Good idea 
---
His original post says that he is laid up and out of work with a scapular injury so this is his only out.  I can't say I blame him for getting sucked into a video game, I can relate to his situation.
---
I dont know.
---
We will probably never know.
---
I respect you for sticking with this game for such a long time and helping the community in the way you have. However I think you might need to take it as a sign that Bethesda doesn't deserve such a dedicated player. I'm sure there are other gaming communities that would love to have you. Bethesda right now however doesn't seem to care in the slightest for the hardcore players considering their behavior. Either that or they are highly incompetent, which I doubt they are.
---
They are letting exploited items slip through the cracks while banning players who have grinded hard. They don't want to properly punish players who paid irl money for gear because their afraid to scare them off. While at the same time increasing the grind difficulty via nerfs and the entire game being based off of an RNG looting system. It seems to me that Bethesda has become entirely controlled by the fiance team and it shows. They care nothing for the regular consumer who just wants to buy and play the game. Reason why the atom shop still gets new content is because they keep funding that while not properly funding bug fixes and QA testing. Which is why the game is in it's sorry state. 
---
Honestly though I'm sorry you got improperly banned and I hope you get your account back. I'm just saying that till they fix this game you deserve better. Hopefully you get your account back when the content update drops.
---
A simple system to flag suspicious players isn't going to be designed to account for a case as EXTREME as this. 
---
You've been playing the game for 900 HOURS.  That's an average of almost ten hours a day every day since the game came out.  Just by playing "normally" and picking up stuff over that much time your inventory history is going to easily go beyond the average players and any buffer zone they would have used to account for their assumption of a "dedicated" player.
---
You didn't get banned because of a coding error or because people reported you for being high leveled, you got banned because no one at Bethesda likely would have thought to factor in the idea that someone would have spent almost 40% of their time since the game released playing the game.
---
Indeed, that would be fantastic information to have.  Is it the patch this week or are we stuck in limbo here. Far too many people are calling shenanigans, I‚Äôm hoping Bethesda has once again screwed up. 
---
This exact thing happened to me at Harper's Ferry a few hours ago. Server was laggy. The crossbow sold but was still showing in my inventory. Rejoined and it was gone. 
---
Youll be hundred percent fine.
---
Theres alot considering the time it is, and I bet more when work/ school is out.
---
This isn't a courthouse or a law course. It's a private company sending out what appear to be largely temporary bans for item duplication. And you agreed to play by their rules. You can't raise a stink once you're finally subject to them in a way you don't like (or you can, you'll just have no integrity in doing so).
---
So while I hope the innocent people can get 'justice', it's ludicrous to compare private sector services to public justice. The entire process is different, you have no attorneys and no judge and no jury. You have only their policies and their decisions-- though typically there is a way to appeal. 
---
Apex is free! Might take your mind off this dumpster fire.
---
My son was banned and likely the reason was nuka colas.  He bought nukas for 5k caps for 25k colas.  There is nothing that is flat out wrong with him doing this.  He was not the one doing the cheating.  he legitimately purchased the in-game item.  
---
According to the email, he will be unbanned once they put out a patch for the exploit.  Well, Bethesda supposedly patched the duping.  Does this mean there is still an exploit despite them removing all these items from players last week?  And why are the accounts with hundreds of TSEs not getting the ban treatment?  
---
100,000 over 30 days.
---
Mules.  Trading with your mule over and over would total 100,000 over 30 days without ever accumulating 100,000 of the rare item at one time.
---
It‚Äôs still 3,333 of an item once a day.
---
333 of an item 10 times a day.
---
It‚Äôs possible.
---
I also wonder if dropping an item and picking it back up counts towards the total accumulation over 30 days each time the item is picked back up.
---
I‚Äôm not saying there is truth to every claim, I am saying without knowing specifics about an algorithm used, it might be possible to have small amounts of a rare item that appear to total 100,000 accumulated over 30 days by a very active player using mules.
---
That's just the tip.
---
For my own sense of believability I'm going with the idea that the glass going into those windows is broken pieces of glass I found laying around rather than assuming my character is casting new panes of glass. But, honestly, if they're going to put broken glass in the window I'd rather they just left the window empty, instead.
---
You car enough to still lurk around the subreddit after over a month.
---
How many youtube monies are going to be made with this newest narrative?
---
Yea , that makes sense punish the entire player base with an account wipe... just to avoid accidently punishing a few for duping or benefiting from someone else's duping. . 
---
Bethesda has shown to have no integrity , but your right OP could be lying , so we will never know, hopefully we do get some confirmation though 
---
Yes because Bethesda have shown numerous times they are not only dishonest and shifty but that they barely grasp their own game enough to fix stuff.  They have a track record of poor behavior, in this guys case, he has no negative track record that we can see.
---
You it's a reasonable assumption that Bethesda messed up, especially with their numerous screwups so far in this games history.
---
Op is full of crap and they are not banning people for having boughten a duped weapon.
---
Who‚Äôs good who‚Äôs bad 
---
That's crazy talk!
---
actually this game recreates the sense of exploration pretty well. You'll just never run into an npc
---
Yep! 
---
At this point TM L160 could be banned but I wouldn't know not logged in In weeks. 
---
Love the game, just nothing to do and my friends got bored too. 
---
Speaking of needing your help, you won the lottery but you need to transfer me $3,000.00 via money gram or visa gift cards to obtain your $100,000.00!
---
Happened to me yesterday with the set of ultracite you get from the main quest 
---
Well in fairness only the account that got banned knows if it was an error or not they got banned. I see a lot of people who get legit banned run to forms and then claim I got banned for nothing when in fact they were cheating.  Not saying this guy lied or anyone who got banned were or anything like that but I have seen this type of stuff way more than ban errors but I do know errors happen. 
---
I was also suspended. I have 100% never duplicated anything. Level 182 with over 240 hours in game. I play everyday. Only have about 8 weapons, and my character weighs about 285 pounds at all times. Only thing I craft alot is ammo. After I server hop and farm for lead.
---
It really sucks for all that time to go to waste . I won't be buying the game again and starting over because I actually really do feel i was wronged
---
Sounds like a dead game you brain dead idiot. The game wasn‚Äôt supposed to be single player but Berhesda killed the community surrounding it. Fuck this stupid game. 
---
Nope, I'm good. Just server hopping to spawn the Charleston vendor bot
---
Nty
---
My biggest problem with the Bethesda CMs here is that they show up so quickly in the posts that go something like "omg Bethesda thank you for uncovering the color blue in the game!! I love it!!".  But if it's a post like this its radio silent.
---
Thanks.
---
No bans for me .... must be all the money I spend in the atom shop kappa
---
Warframe is really good. Be sure to look up some guides before you play because it can be quite overwhelming. There‚Äôs so many things to do.
---
I'm good. Never duped. Never bought duped things. Only ever bought mutations from another player which makes me nervous. 
---
I just logged in and xbox clipped a video of my entire inventory and stash so I have some proof of what I have on my character incase they are erroneously banning folks. 
---
God roll deathclaw.
---
The way I look at it, someone with 900 hours who loves playing the game, who also took the time to write a big long post about how to go about doing stuff, who is also off work sick with nothing much to do other than play games, is *really* unlikely to have spent that time cheating or doing something like that. False bans happen in many games, there's even a few people on youtube who got cs:go bans and then had them removed from their account. 
---
Bethesda "I'm sorry little one"
---
+F
---
Interesting that you cannot argue the "charges"... I'm sorry dude.  Hopefully BGS users comment on this scenario
---
I do.  I stash lead, steel and gun powder away until I have a pile of it to craft ammo.  I craft the Ammo with super duper and transfer it back to the mule now bulk and then bring it back in usable quantities as I need it.  
---
Perhaps,moving the same items back and forth a few times counts towards my total quantity? 
---
Oh yeah, they LOVE the fluff posts. It doesn't require them to ask anyone anything.
---
If you're not into pvp then warframe is a ton of fun. Just be prepared to spend a good amount of time on the wiki.
---
Isn't having another account not actually violating anything? I don't actually own the game, I'm just going off what I saw another comment saying.
---
I love fallout, but I suck terribly at Apex legends 
---
No worries.  Don't listen to the liars, you'll be safe.
---
Last month it was "You'll get banned if you craft and then scrap for mods!".
---
On the dupe exploit part, I think they inded patched some of the dupe methods but probably there are still some ways to dupe and Bethesda seems to be suspending accounts of people who interacted in some ways with duped stuff, two of my friends with likely dupped weapons also got their accounts suspended. Let's hope people can get the accounts unbanned once the next patch hit, but yeah it's a shame people can play the game because someone else used exploits. 
---
If it is related to having a mule character hold your stuff then it's *possible* that some of these people could have been trading things back and forth to their mule and gotten caught up on accident. Something like having 200 stimpacks (easy enough to do), trading it to your mule, screwing around with your inventory and then trading it back, switching a few things around, giving them back to the mule because you want to fast travel somewhere and sell a few things, come back and grab the stimpacks back. Now the system sees you started with 200 stimpacks and "gained" 400 in a short period of time. Especially if you traded back and forth to your mule through paper bag drops instead of the admittedly wonky trade window.
---
I still think it's likely a lot of the people complaining about being banned actually *were* duping but it's possible their are some false positives being caused by mule usage.
---
I've been all over, it's usually radscorpions tho
---
Consuming that much a day isn't unreasonable, but crafting it might be. That'd be 556 batches of 5mm over 30 days (at 180 a batch with Ammosmith 2). Each batch takes 8 gunpowder, 15 lead, and 30 steel, so that's 4448 gunpowder, 8340 lead, and 16680 steel. It's certainly doable, but would take some very dedicated farming for that much lead (that much steel or gunpowder wouldn't be that hard to acquire over 30 days of normal play, though they'd likely be picking up every weapon and junk item they came across to scrap, so weight would be an issue)
---
That's a question that's hard to answer with lore because it's the players decision who is good and who isn't. I would say tho that factions like the Enclave, Institute, Legion and maybe even the BOS are to be considered evil whereas for the NCR, Minutemen, Lyons' BOS the opposite is true.
---
Impossible, that's a false statement based on the premise that they use solid coding to discover the Anomaly.   Its therefore probable that they did make a mistake or that the ban is for a reason other then what they wrote in the generic ban email.
---
You would think it would be impossible to have a game this screwed up from a major publisher....they proved that untrue as well.
---
Most forms of corporate espionage would probable sound wildly unnecessary - but it happens (because it gets results) . 
---
Oxhorn just did a video yesterday about ALL the mothman interloper stuff. I highly recommend it.
---
That‚Äôs lame, though I assume the suspension is temporary given full band usually come with a chance to appeal 
---
Sounds like if at anytime you had over the allotted quantities of rare items even if it was for a few minutes you'll get banned. Seems like they're making it so you can't dupe then spread the goods though mules. 
---
You cheated. Time to suffer the consequences
---
Why don't Bethesda just delete items if they think something is suspicious? 
---
I'm waiting for Survival mode myself. Adventure is full of sniveling cowards too scared to PVP. Playing D:OS2 until then.
---
You intentionally broke the rules. You should be banned. People need to stop blaming Bethesda for something they did wrong. No offence but you did cheat intentionally.
---
How are they supposed to prove a negative?  "Prove they weren't duping"?  
---
I tend to feel most of the bans are probably justified, but demanding proof of a negative is just as silly
---
I think Bethesda fucking up is an even simpler solution, I can't remember the last time they just straight up did something correctly.
---
I had actually just finished that quest the day before but I did it with T-60 not ultracite 
---
Lol 900 hours
---
I‚Äôve got 5k fusion cells just in case!
---
Which, don‚Äôt get me wrong, makes sense.  Though any offense I made was around a month ago and they really need to be more transparent with this.  Just as they demanded proof from suspected cheaters in original ban waves, I expect proof now.
---
The more I read this sub I'm glad I didn't buy this game 
---
That's sad. Obviously I'm taking your word for it but, assuming you didn't have those items, it means they just saw the reports and swung the ban hammer without even checking _their own logs_ to verify the item counts.
---
Like, really, isn't it easier to just ban the correct people the first time rather than having to revisit all these cases? Oh, that's right, they _don't_ revisit your case unless you make a enough noise on this sub to make them look bad.
---
So transparent. 
---
pretty much what everyone else said. when you equip power armor, it replaces and removes your regular armor and it's effects (including pockets and +strength).
---
Also, according to the wiki, Power armor chasses bring your base carry weight to a flat 205lbs by making your Strength 11 when wearing it. if you surpass 11 strength, the chassis will bring you down to 11 when wearing it.
---
additionally, the Excavator power armor gives you +100 carry weight with all pieces. you can add motion servos mod to the torso for +2 strength (each point of strength is +5 carry weight) and for each leg with the calibrated shocks mod, you get an additional +50lbs carry weight, for a grand total of +210lbs.
---
You don't have to believe me but seriously I never duped, I watched the videos but it they were just too much and complicated to do honestly.   
---
I have picked up random bags dropped at White Springs and other places. mostly at WS and not junk, like 1 star items like baseball mits and other things people never use and drop but thats about it.   
---
I use a level 50 BOS rifle I made, no stars and a 1 star quad capacity shotgun. I had a 2 star expoding but killed myself too many times...lol   
---
Most the time I'm looking for plastic and material to make ammo which I usually make 200-400 rounds max... so honestly... I don't know what the 100,000 could be even if it was a combo of stuff... 
---
Played today just fine.
---
I was wondering why I get random caps..
---
My son got the ban today.  He had bought nuka colas for 5k caps for 25k colas.  He drank them all and this happened back in January.  He no longer had all the nuka colas on him.  He had no more than 1 or two of each nuka cola, about 100 stimpacks and maybe 50-100 of most resources in his stash.  Apparently Bethesda just wants to ban everyone.  My son is level 130+.  This was ridiculous.  It would be better if tehre was crossplay I would just buy another copy of the game and help hi level up but I have it on PC and he is on Xbox!
---
A restart will kill the game, I wouldnt invest time to refarm all my stuff I spent hours getting.
---
When they say a fix is found they mean they have a way to remove the duped items from inventory.   While they have supposedly fixed duping (I'm sure another way will be found) they have stated numerous times they are unable to remove said duped items from players inventory. 
---
I'm sorry your kid got banned,  I have kids and it's TRUE they fail to see the cause and effect of their actions till it's often to late.
---
Word! I‚Äôll be online at some point this afternoon, I‚Äôll keep an eye out for ya

---
him? they banned thousands of innocents today... before they may banned 99% dupers but this kind of ban wave seems to randomly hit players incl. causals.
---
Maybe this is a sign you should really take a break.
---
Pardon me for trading 
---
You need a hobby. The game isnt even that good to have more than 100 hours in it. 
---
Awkward is the posts from people who swear they uninstalled the game weeks or months ago yet still lurk around eager to jump into every negative thread to tell everyone how glad they are they aren't playing the game they're still so obsessed with.
---
How is that griefing? He legit trapped you. Why do you think traps are even in the game? This is the whole point of the game being online with other players.
---
I collect about 2k steel a day for sale, and I can get over 2,000 lead every time I go to Lucky Hole Mine, assuming I have the acid. I do that very rarely these days because acid is scarce and I don't claim the acid workshop anymore unless I'm alone on a server. But it is easily possible to get that much in 30 day. I highly doubt that Bethesda would include 5mm ammo in the list of rare items to have over 100k of in 30 days.
---
I've seen you around man, that's brutal as shit because I see you and your squad chaining up queens which is epics, that's gutting to see you banned ._. Hope they sort that shit
---
they'll tell you that they have no tools to check this but advise you to wrote a feedback ticket to devs where you won't get a reply at all....
---
how can i believe in someone who just created  a reddit account 4 days ago?
---
We get it, you uninstalled and deleted Fallout 76, otherwise you wouldn't be posting here bitching about dupers being banned. Does it suck having friends get banned? Yeah, it does, pretty sure a friend of mine got banned today. Does it make sense since it's an exploit that people have continued to use, knowing they could get banned? Yeah, it does. Quit whining
---
With how much they have proved otherwise.....in what way are you completely sure.  They have been screwing stuff up since day one of FO76,  what guarantees this is any different.
---
I got the error code twice yesterday and logged back in no problem.
---
This morning, I played with zero issues.
---
Curious to see IF anything happened while I am at work.
---
I've been wondering what I'm doing wrong as well. I've been playing it like the last fallouts. I just explore and kill things. It wasnt hard to level up. 
---
I think the difference here is bathesda had to work the multiplayer aspect and had to have a hood justification for it: bonus XP. Really the game is designed around it.
---
I know there where some false positives. Because mother brother got suspended. He never duped and hasn‚Äôt played the game in almost 2 months.
---
The TOS is so vague they can ban people for any reason at all. Yiou can get banned for sharing bugs that don't exist or for embarrassing someone .
---
BRAVO... best write up ever on all of this! 
---
woo, a top of which building?
---
Good, thats what we wanted a few days ago, swarms of "im banned" posts, no takebacksies.
---
 I have a mule.... My accounts fine 
---
I'm on forced vacation anyway. Bethesda seems to be like a boss telling me I did work too much and really should take a week off, or two.
---
They'd have to be trading the items back and forth between the mule and the primary for that to work out. The point of the mule is to store stuff for the primary. If I'm using a mule to store an item, I'm just going to add what new items I have to their inventory, I'm not going to take the items they already have, then give them and the new items back.
---
I'll do 350 and if that no good now the offer will stand 
---
I haven't played since December. Right now I am neck deep in Resident Evil 2.
---
The thing is that this person had 22k nuka-grape.  I‚Äôm sure he used the same method to get the regular ammo.  I‚Äôm sure they can tell when something is produced normally vs duped.  No one would have that much nuka-grape in a month legitimately.  This person was duping and is not innocently making ammo and getting banned
---
Can't tell you how glad I am to never have to worrry about this as I don't cheat.
---
Hoarding ammo and two shots just in case
---
What about the person who put 900 hours into the game who says he got falsely banned today?
---
I'm sure it's not a dupe. 
---
Despite the fact that a deathclaw gauntlet is the most OP weapon in the game and only takes up 1% of your stash........ LOL....... I'm sure people are just lining up to sell their god roll DCG without making a duplicate.
---
1 of each flux
---
Boom fusion core
---
Theory:  Bethesda banned people with cheating accounts.  
---
Have you dealt in large quantities of transfers?
---
Ark isn't a AAA game dev either  
---
Just saying, comparing apples to wombats
---
Talks about tasting another man's salt üòÇ
---
We have no way of knowing either way. The blame is on Bethesda. They facilitated an environment where things could be duped as well as had no real tracking system for potential maliciousness.
---
**First:**
---
I have to prove exactly jack and s***.. Especially since it's impossible to prove a negative...   
---
But if you have doubts about my character check my post history and see what kind of comments and posts I make...  
---
**Second:**  
---
I stopped grinding 6 weeks ago, as in aggressively trying to level, when I hit Lvl 300...  
---
**Third:**  
---
I run three accounts at the same time, often 2 of them actively killing and looting at the same grinding spot, so double, if not tripple what you've done.   
---
**Fourth:**  
---
When I said I thew away nothing, I mean that literally.  
---
I loot every single weapons, ever piece of armor, every junk item, every time I play, and scrap it all.  
---
**Fifth and Last:**  
---
Not always a good idea to use your own experience as a baseline, unless your one of the hyper-Op power gamers, your comparing your 200 hours to people with close to a thousand hours.  
---
I see you scaled your numbers up, but your failing to take into account the almost multiplicative difference between a casual player and an insane power leveling addict.   
---
As an example, I have nearly 1,000 unique 2* and 3* Legendaries either being used it muled.... 
---
Unique means they don't stack and don't have the same effects as each other... So they can't be "cloned" items
---
The devs didn't "call that BF5 player out on his bullshit." The devs simply stated that Dice/EA actually has no authority to overrule the anti-cheat system(Fairfight) and even unfair bans are outside their ability to correct. They also stated that they cannot confirm or deny any allegations of cheating during to user privacy agreements.
---
&gt; Now Im not going to lie and say "Oh Ive never duped anything!" as I did dupe an explosive combat rifle for my friend 
---
That's all there is to this. There is nothing you can do. You earned the ban.
---
No the videos were posted by different people.
---
Not if you lock them...
---
XD
---
If this is all true, and I tend to think it is, this is a travesty.  I may reach a day when I just quit this game too.  I enjoy playing it but I know I‚Äôve been ripped off.  I paid for two copies of this game (one for my closest friend who struggles a bit for money) and I know I‚Äôve been had.  When I see posts like this, I tend to think others have been had as well.  If I got banned, I know I‚Äôd never play another Bath product again.  Honestly, I‚Äôm probably there already.  I‚Äôll play this till I get sick of it and never buy another one of their games again.
---
Energy and Explosive, mainly explosive, but Fireproof was changed to provide explosive resistance, in addition, to fire a few patches back.
---
You're right excuse me for my previous account being hackedü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
This is a great point! 
---
I‚Äôm level 936 and have every rank of every perk. 
---
The way the system works is you can get just enough duplicates to achieve every rank. After that, you cannot get more lf that perk in any way. Not by perk packs either. 
---
If a perk has a max rank, you can get that perk card a max of 6 times.
---
3 of those makes a rank 3 card.
---
2 of those make a  rank 2 card.
---
1 of those make a rank 1 card.
---
You couldn‚Äôt get another max rank card of the same perk. Each rank (except for rank 1) can only be achieve once so you‚Äôll never have truly useless cards. 
---
You can argue the perk system as a whole isn‚Äôt the best, but ‚Äòduplicates‚Äô are not an issue/bug/oversight. They have their use.
---
Running in my underwear doing my autistic screech routine at other players begging for drugs until they log out or gimme drugs. Basically forcing social interaction in a game filled with quiet introverts 
---
If you turn it into ammo immediately, the weight is negligible. Lead is easy between all the gyms, lucky hole mine with excavator and a few server hops, etc. I don't really keep track of how much 5mm I use myself but I've bought alot of lead from other players too to make more ammo.
---
I‚Äôd give up if I were you mate, embarrassing ü§£
---
I pm you
---
I tried to read through the terms of service this morning to see if having two accounts was forbidden. Obviously I didn't want to spend all day reading it, so I did word searches and didn't find anything? Can anyone else answer this question for me?
---
I only have one person I know and play with, and he usually helps me switch items between my alts. He also logs in his girlfriend's character on her computer and gives items to her while she's at work.
---
Neither of them play much anymore, but I still play every day and want to transfer stuff. (Sucks when you find a perfect melee weapon while playing your non-melee character.) I was considering a second account just for item swapping between alts. And maybe I'd make five more characters to go through all the story content that many more times, and of course I'd have to pay double cash for the atoms to get shop items on both accounts' characters. Maybe this is a bad idea?
---
The grass/shrubs part is the reason my current base is flying. I got so sick of having stuff randomly sticking up through my base in most places.
---
He was banned for duping... how is that Bethesda's fault?
---
Uh, no. They did call him out in so many words. They said that they could not go in to detail but that OP knew why he was banned. That is calling him out. Weird how you choose to acknowledge every other comment but not that one.... lol
---
You don't need to take over a power plant - buy a 180 cap fusion generator plan from one of several vendors (at least one in Watoga) and then just take the workshop outside any of the power plants.  Takes a couple minutes, slap down a fusion genny (uses 95% free materials from the workshop and usually only needs one or two things from you like one nuclear material).  Throw a lock on it, handle one defense mission as it pops up and you're good for hours.
---
Generates one core every 7.5 minutes and you absolutely do not need to take the plant.
---
Well. What do you play on? If I find any, I'll add you, and trade them to you, if we're on the same platform. 
---
My Tree House is two stories up (two stair cases) plus 1.5 stories tall (sloped roof) and I can't make it any taller due to the height limits.  In the other Fallout games I seem to remember 3 stories being the limit as well.
---
Width wise, it's about 10x, at it's widest point. 
---
My best guess is that it's 3 x 10 x 10 (H x W x D).
---
Not trying to fear monger, just saying if the OPis legit and it's about total quantity, I'm a little worried 
---
I've encountered a lot more griefing lately.  I think people are bored
---
900 hours within \~96 days of the game being released; a bit over 100 if we include stress test and BETA? Roughly 8+ hours a day or so? Really?!
---
Something's fishy here...
---
&gt; You'll just never run into an npc
---
Sentient super mutants and robots notwithstanding.  I mean, they are npc's in every sense of the word.  
---
Because a lot of people have been banned that weren't duping?
---
Well if Bethesda bans a ton of people they may make more money from some of the banned players that will buy the game again . I won't. I've spent hundreds of hours in game , now for nothing 
---
I'm so so sorry that you were actually having a good time and got caught up in their fuckery. 
---
The asshole in me, however, can't help but think 'hahahahahahahahaha fucking figures'. 
---
Fucka you Bethesda, and fucka you, dolpheen!
---
I pick up everything, and I mean every. single. thing. and I scrap it. I probably have 1k of steel on average per level. Granted I play slowly, mostly because I scrap everything and am usually over encumbered. so 50 to 100k is average from my gameplay style. Even in single player games like Oblivion, I collected those Blue Elven Crystal things, dont know what they were for but I had a house full of them, like floor to ceiling, not exaggerating lol.
---
I agree that ammo is likely not on their list (maybe fusion cores, but not "normal" ammo). 
---
Making 4 trips to the Lucky Hole Mine plus whatever is needed to get enough acid to smelt the ore is something I would consider very dedicated farming. It could be done, but that's about all you'd be doing with your play time.
---
Not the person you were replying to, but commenting on a post when it's on your front page/second page is hardly lurking in the sub.
---
Sucks to be a cheater
---
Decision is final. No appeals will be considered. 
---
This sounds like an awfully flawed way of conducting business. It's basically BGS saying "we dont make mistakes ever.
---
2 things... 1st... Bethesda could have literally bashed the whole deal with setting a players weight limit to say 1,000 pounds max but they didn't and people joked saying they weight 100,000 to a million pounds!   
---
2nd... WHO honestly took the time to figure out HOW TO DUPE? What are the odds someone randomly drops 300 boards or whatever it was into a random box and then adds there own stuff to then magically come back and be surprised???  
---
It all seems way too easy and it was leaked... I'm betting someone inside did this and leaked it... 
---
If you don't own the game, why are you reading this sub then?  Genuinely curious.
---
Same. Apparently some people are upset you weren't caught like they were and are downvoting you for showing discretion and caution.
---
Bethesda only banned people who were at some time involved in duping and have stashes of duped items. I am part of a 50+ man guild where most of us trade extensively and have mule accounts none of us got banned. If you got banned you've at some point done the dirty, and all these posts where people claim to have been wrongly accused of duping are just desperate attempts to quell their conscience. 
---
I haven't uninstalled, but I haven't played in months.  
---
I spend time checking things out here, hoping things will show signs of improvement to the degree that I want to play again.  
---
Don't jump down Bethesda's throat just yet...I have a feeling this isn't the entire story.
---
The plan does indeed exist. I saw it yesterday, although I can't remember where. I was checking vendors for the fusion generator plan (yeah, I know, do the Poseidon thing; I simply don't want to), and was striking out even though several are supposed to have it. Had to hop around a bit. It was possibly either Camden Park, or Grafton Station. Noticed it because I didn't know it was a thing.

You're the one with the poor choice of words.... LOL.
---
I like Warframe but the one thing I hate the most about it is that it kind of feels like a mobile game sometimes in that there are these incredibly long crafting timers(like actual days long sometimes) for certain things. I haven't played a lot in the last I guess two years now so it might have changed oh, but I try to keep up with patch notes and other things at least because I'm still interested in development
---
I'm still playing.
---
My son was banned.  We know the reason.  He purchased nuka-colas.  5k caps for 20k+ colas.  He got a lot of caps that way.  Its not really his fault.  He used the in game trading to acquire the items.  They just happened to be duped!  Why were all the weapon dupers safe?  They did not get their accounts banned for having hundreds of TSEs.  They just had the extras deleted.  This is complete BS!
---
OP literally said he was a duper. The rest of them are full of shit. If Bethesda comes back with an apology and unban I will gladly come back to this thread and give you an upvote though.
---
That makes sense pal
---
How about a list of lies Bethesda has made about  the game, or a list of unfixed issues still around months after release.
---
No offense, but when cheaters get banned from games the first thing they always do is go on a great big forum crusade about how the devs are banning people for no reason, hoping to stir up sentiment against them and erode people's trust in the game. This has been Cheater 101 ever since online games existed.
---
I've worked in moderation and community management for online games and I can guarantee you that account termination is never done lightly precisely because even if it's 100% justified there will be people who let themselves be convinced that the devs are banning innocents. You also can't show people the evidence against a person most of the time, because the evidence is the reason they got banned. Like if someone posted a racist rant on a forum of course the moderators won't show you that post once it's been moved to archives. The whole damn reason it had to be removed and the author was banned was because it was unacceptable to have it on display. 
---
Is there potential for abuse in a system that can condemn people without showing the public the evidence? Yes. However, the notion that companies do this out of stupidity or ideological bias is simply nonsense. At the end of the day it's about money, and that means you don't kick someone out of your business and have them run around town telling everyone how evil you are unless letting them stay will drive away even more customers. 
---
Also consider how many times you see posts in online games where people wonder how someone is getting away with what they are doing without getting banned and getting angry at the devs for letting something that's obviously an exploit go unpunished. That happens way more often than posts that claim someone has been banned unfairly and that's because people don't usually get banned without good evidence.
---
Post what kind of stuff you like and we'll give you some better suggestions!
---
Interesting. 
---
I'm on PS4 that's would be great! 
---
"Rare in game items"
---
Pretty sure that doesn't cover steel/wood/or pretty much any other resources. 
---
If it WAS a mistake good luck but it doesn't seem likely. 
---
Hopefully it doesn't cost 2.5 k atoms in the atom shop and is only black.
---
You sure chopped up that behemoth's meat.
---
Anthem has been AMAZING.  I got premier access, so I could play the early access.  I'm going to be plunking down $60 for it, if I'm being honest.  I'm really having a blast so far.   I've only got 24 hours in the game, but so far so good.  I only learned about this game 5 days ago too.   
---
I dunno, I loot everything as well since I'm a builder, and I can't imagine having anywhere near that much steel. Maybe if I *only* farmed steel specifically... but why would you do that?
---
Still sounds unrealistic.
---
Best way to find out of the game stops being a dumpster-fire would be to be subbed and interacting with the community.
---
Fuckaa youuu, chicken and cow! 
---
 "Bethesda needs to do a full reset on all accounts! Unban everyone! Let everyone start over at nothing."
---
My wife and I have knowingly duped or possessed duped items.  We have not been hit with the ban hammer as so many people are.  But your "solution" is to start everyone over?  So, you insist that we be punished for things we did not do.  We've got a lot of time invested into the game, being sure not to violate and ToS.  We should not be punished because of the idiots who can't follow rules.  Sure, your solution would potentially fix an issue, but it would also unfairly punish the innocent.
---
Let's follow your train of though, eh?  Because people like Ted Bundy murdered a lot of people, how about we arrest everyone and put them in prison on death row?  Doesn't sound like good logic to you now?  Yeah, I didn't think it would.
---
Wtf is up with everyone pumping this game on the FO76 sub? It feels like a bunch of shills pumping a penny stock.
---
This game is so fucking dead, lol.
---
Considering Bethesda's track record so far, I'm willing to give the users the benefit of the doubt. I mean, what's one more fuck up on top of everything else?
---
I don't know, I tend to stick to one game exclusively until I'm finished playing through it - although usually it's a story-driven SP game, rather than something as wide open as FO76.
---
I'm going to need to see a screen shot of that comment that says he knew why he was bannes. I particularly remember them saying that the privacy agreements make it impossible for them to discuss user information. 
---
Its so they can sell Clean Farmhouse and Clean Warehouse walls in the atomic shop in a future update.
---
Check out Elite: Dangerous if you like space games.  It's going strong and has a pretty good community overall.  
---
Never duped, logged in fine. Just did a 3 hour session on the same server the whole time. 
---
Most of the time when someone prominent gets banned and comes crying that it was unjust, usually turns out it was for a good reason.
---
I understand.  It doesn‚Äôt sound like something most people would likely do.
---
If you used a mule like a store to buy and sell stuff, or did a lot of indecisive storage rearranging between mules and main character it‚Äôs possible.
---
Neither of these sound like normal play styles.
---
I wanted to show it‚Äôs possible, maybe not plausible to accumulate a very large total over 30 days without ever having a large quantity on hand at any given time.
---
Why someone would be doing this type of behavior is another question.
---
Guess I'm not alone;

Sure, no doubt that Wildcard (Ark Devs) is no where near the class of a AAA game company. And yet they treat their customers better than the big boys who see their customers as little more than perpetual cash trees, they get you for an investment price of 60-90 dollars in most cases then sell you digital goods that only pertain to that investment property and can never be transphered to another player. 
---
Thanks but I'll be taking my wombats. 
---
Sorry to see that you got banned, they have screwed the pooch over there at Bethesda.  I would say if you need a new game to play and havent played it maybe try out Monster Hunter World, that's an amazing game with tons of replayability. 
---
Nah. You can go find it since you're the one in here disagreeing with me. 
---
I hoard 4 types off gun ammo, that I use - give away the rest. 
---
Also like to keep a few mini nukes up my sleeve, for the dixk's who annoy people ;)
---
LMAO this game might be one of the worst games of all time in terms of the difference between expectations and reality and the last few kiddies are literally cheerleading for the most engaged players to be banned! Its honestly gold. I wonder if the sycophants realize they enable  this garbage to begin with
---
&gt;and canceling my Rage 2 pre-order   
---
And this makes sense how? Rage 2 is developed by iD, not BGS. 
---
I did and I owned up to it. I stopped instantly when People started reporting that it was affecting other people, and did my "part" in helping to report people duping. I feel like I was a lesser case, seeing as it was untold months ago. I will stand by their call because I did cheat, but I personally feel I deserve a slap on the wrist for such a minor thing, comparatively.  
---
I've been off for 2 months or so... game is just boring at this point
---
Yes your 100 percent right. They could have handle and prevented it from the beginning.
---
Sorry to hear this I hope it gets sorted for you soon
---
I DIDN'T CHEAT EXCEPT FOR THOSE TIMES I CHEATED!
---
I have pacifist on and occasionally shoot at or smack people I'm trying to give stuff to when other methods such as the come here emote dont work.
---
You're ok.. OP over-reacted.
---
Yeah, the bulldoze inconsistency bugs me. Sure, it removes small stuff and I get that it won't remove everything. Wish it could remove more trees but the thing that annoys me most about it is that it can remove a few things here or there and my base can look nice...then I log back in the next day and suddenly have shrubs sticking up through my floor. I've torn apart my base and moved because of it before.

Dear @BethesdaStudios: My Friends Duped, I Benefited. #BanMeToo [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as1f4m/dear\_bethesda\_my\_friends\_duped\_i\_benefited/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as1f4m/dear_bethesda_my_friends_duped_i_benefited/) 
---
I mean a post like this...you‚Äôre literally asking for it
---
"email talking about having 100000 of items"
---
I get it though, Bethesda needs fans like you to not call them out and think they do can do no wrong. I love bethesda but they're not perfect. 
---
And they're full of shit? You sure? Do you have anything to back up this claim that everyone is lying? Or are you too afraid to admit that bethesda may have possibly messed up here?
---
Perhaps because Bethesda didn't detail what specifically made their accounts ban worthy? Where's their proof fam? THEY have the burden of proof here. 
---
So you're saying that the bug that existed where people could accidentally steal your stuff and was actually patched. Didn't exist and was just a market troll even though it existed, and was patched. You're a funny guy you. üòÇ
---
The people complaining are full of shit. Some of them have even admitted to past duping or being traded mass quantities of duped items. It's not hard to run a database query and look how many Nuka Cola Quantums or Halloween Candies someone has. This happened last ban wave too. I don't know why people are so inclined to trust these threads.
---
Lmao, wow I haven‚Äôt played since before Christmas  but I‚Äôve been checking in the sub.
---
I can‚Äôt believe the things I‚Äôve been seeing on here everyday. Anyone defending Bethesda and this game at this point is in denial 100% 
---
That‚Äôs awesome!
---
I don't know how they can be acquired anymore.  Obviously, they used to show up at the two Grafon vendors.
---
My brother got suspend for having a lot o steel on a alt Character and Stimpacks.
---
I know for a fact he never duped and he hasn‚Äôt played on his account since around Christmas. He did have a nuke for the extra Stimpacks and Steel though.
---
It's pretty clear they're going after people with huge amounts of duped items. 
---
I mean, I get it. I was expecting people to down vote this post just to be funny or troll me or something. But my question remains. 
---
I honestly never duped, I have picked up dropped bags of stuff mostly at WS but nothing great or rare. I do have a mule since early on to carry mostly junk or higher level armor I couldn't wear at the time.   
---
So saying that people duped is wrong. I'm sure people did but I'm 100% positive I didn't.   
---
Could I have picked up or bought a duped item? Maybe but how are we suppose to tell? (Keep in mind my rarest item is a 2 star machete... nothing major and neither myself or mule is overweight. 
---
I would say yes lol 
---
&gt; Still haven't seen any evidence this or anyone else's account of being accidentally banned is true. 100% of these posts are on the good faith of OPs word
---
Still haven't seen any evidence that any of those bans are legitimate, either.  100% of those posts are taking in good faith Bethesda's word, if you believe they were legitimate.  
---
So it's really up in the air either way, but something has to give.  
---
Happy ~~Reclamation~~ Cake Day!
---
Tip on point 1. If you use the option to change a wall into another of its optional shapes and choose the doorway one for all walls attached to a given foundation then you can remove it without having to remove any of the walls.
---
Do you use mods from nexusmods? This was happening to me after not playing for awhile. I had to update the mods.
---
Hahaha and you actually think the duping is dead! Oh to be young and naive again
---
Oh, can you?  I never realized locking them was an option.
---
Any thoughts on who figured how to dupe anyways? or leaked how to do it? 
---
Ooooooor...we just see that dupers being banned was a very, VERY obvious thing that has been happening and would continue to happen. Not Bethesda's fault that dumbasses like OP expected for his buddies to not get banned. Again, it sucks losing friends due to the ban wave, but it makes a shit ton of sense and was expected.
---
What happened? PVP happened in a game that shouldn't have PVP. 
---
I have a tree house also. The highest floor is 7 levels above the foundation. When I placed the camp I put it in about the middle (height wise respective to the build area), so I think the above estimate is correct in that regard. 3 - 4 floors in any direction from the initial camp placement.
---
Its a BGS game.  I said I will cancel my pre-order, not refuse to buy it as it is in fact developed by iD and therefore should hopefully be decent.  However, as a BGS game, I don‚Äôt want to risk having to deal with their handling of situations if I can see the game is a mess.
---
Seriously. I haven't played since Resident Evil 2 came out and probably won't play again until some new content drops. Enjoyed my time with the game, but holy crap the amount of drama on this sub provides hours and hours of entertainment. 
---
I've been playing monster hunter world lately. It's so refreshing playing an online game that works smoothly. After 30 hrs in MHW, I logged in yesterday to see if I had any items removed. None from what I can tell, but I had 1 disconnect and 3 freezes in the span of 2 hours. Dropped a nuke on white springs to for some good ol' fashion ghoulf club farming, and I got out of my power suit since I wasnt taking any rads, and continued to not take any rads running around in the nuke zone. Sometimes the bugs pay for themselves!
---
I logged in with my GF the other night after a month or so of not logging in. 
---
It was so boring. I pretty much just need to launch my first nuke, and I have 0 desire to bother with it because I couldn't care any less about 'end game' farming. 
---
Even my GF, who absolutely loves building her CAMP up (and, holy shit, hers is so much nicer than mine), has been discouraged from playing. Now she can't even afford plans for the aspect of the game she enjoyed. 
---
Shit, even following me around for quests (I'm about 20 levels higher) is no good, because we inevitably attract a scorchbeast that depletes any ammo I have left, breaks my nearly useless weapons, and kills both of us time and time again until she flees and I double-down to kill the fucker. 
---
Surprise. Amazing. I didn‚Äòt get banned ... 
---
Awkward is the posts that dissent from the mere expression of opinion and not the opinion itself. Just because people pop back in occasionally to see the state of the game they hoped was going to be good isn't a disparaging act. Criticism is the best chance consumers have at improving an out-of-touch business. Grow up.
---
Curious to see this documented proof. Sauce OP?
---
ITT: Dupers
---
I‚Äôve got a feeling OP somehow cheated. I‚Äôve never amassed more than a few thousand steel unless I griefed someone and I‚Äôm lvl 200+
---
Except people are being banned left and right for not duping 
---
So, ltp, basicly?
---
I got proof they knew about from an employee at Bethesda Austin. How it got leaked out to dupers idk.
---
I know there was Duping in the public beta before launch.
---
Yeah, the decontamination shower being forced to ground floor bugs me.
---
There's also a couple at Haven Church, a bit north of Harper's Ferry right along the main road.  They sell for a decent amount of caps, too.
---
Pale-Aurora The only thing we have to go on that people got banned unfairly and for an error on these posts is the OP's word it happened. If there is proof other than just their word then I could take that at face value but until then how do you or anyone else other than the OP's who post these "I got banned for nothing" is actually true yet people like you jump around and state O look they are banning everyone for nothing. 
---
I did as well.
---
&gt; I code stuff like this on a daily basis, and I'm sorry to say it's impossible to make a mistake like this.
---
lol?  
---
I'm not sure how anyone who's written even a single line of code in their lifetime could think that it's not possible to make any mistake.  
---
Social history has no bearing on the current exchange. Someone could have a thousand pleasant posts and still dupe. Being a duper doesn't make someone a jerk or anything else other than a person who cheats, whether frequently or occasionally. 
---
Aside from that, it is indeed a good idea to use personal experience as a baseline when you are in the majority group, which I am. If you've played 1000 hours of this game you are an ultra minority. :P  
---
So you've provided some reasoning, but still no proof. That said, it doesn't really matter, because I'm not the person who needs convincing, so if you're innocent and banned I hope you can come up with something substantial to send to Bethesda. Maybe point out that you play three accounts, that could be verifiable on their end. 
---
They do on a mule account, I run (3) active accounts all the time 
---
I'm happy you're enjoying the game, just take your time and don't rush through it like I did. Be kind to other players and I'm sure you'll have an alright experience.
---
I just need to finally pull my pants up and get that last achievement before they shut the servers down...
---
don't know what that means
---
I do it about weekly, because that's about the amount of acid and gunpowder I pick up. It only takes about 15 minutes to clean out the mine and smelt the ore. But it takes a week to gather the acid with normal play.
---
I have a mule with a bunch of junk I got when I killed a guy who must have been a duper. I have since given away or used most of it but it was 10000 lbs of junk when I first got it now it's right over the max limit but my account is still fine
---
Just responded to somebody else. I received my proof from an Bethesda Austin employee or former employee.
---
I'd also throw out, as another suggestion - you don't *need* to use Power Armor outside of nuke zones.
---
If you use butchers bounty you pick up double. It‚Äôs either that or green thumb that works on it. Then it‚Äôs nbd at all to finish. 
---
But can you the fast travel to fight the Queen and immediately run into a fissure and die because you are too busy looking at the sky trying to find her?
---
I can do that in less than 39 seconds.
---
Awesome. What's your PSN? I'll add you. 
---
Just explore. There is a random T-60 mod next to the BoS corpse next to the Watoga Station up the stairs and on the roof.
---
No, it's not a BGS game. 
---
Someone should write an article on all this! Start from the beginning. That would clear a lot up for everyone.
---
I think it might be a storage issue. I have an external hdd and there have been a couple issues reported for having an updated hdd and to put the old one back in (which i don‚Äôt plan on doing). Since it‚Äôs an external though, maybe I can transfer the game over to the internal and maybe that‚Äôll fix it? I‚Äôll give that a shot and let you know if it helped. 
---
I would still buy it. Gives incentive to complete more dailies. 
---
They're being banned for carrying hundreds of thousands of an item. Doesn't matter if you duped or not, if you're carrying a shit of items like that- whether they were given to you or you picked them up somewhere- then yeah, you're gonna get banned. Also makes sense seeing as people have mule characters.
---
It's a power fist. I never said anything about it being a deathclaw gauntlet
---
Nope.
---
I've never duped anything, I've never been to the dev room and I don't have mass stacks of anything.  
---
I don't cheat.  
---
I would guess around 10 minutes? I've got there with 9 minutes something left and managed to do it solo! 
---
So in absence of any evidence either way, you looks at past actions:
---
Glorf has given the community a long write up and valuable info for no reason but to help others.
---
Bethesda has given the community countless bugs and mistakes, and Rad Worms.
---
Notice how none of them ever duped, yet all of them have friends they know did. And they all have overloaded mules. And many bought multiple copies of the game to facilitate trading between mules.
---
And some of them even admit holding stuff for their friends.
---
Dupers and alt/mules were crashing the game. DCs were the biggest complaint.
---
Beth is now actually fixing the problem. And they are mad they got caught.
---
Simple.
---
The game was not a finished product and should have received more time for testing!  A normal beta release would have consisted of a couple months and then a wipe.  This should happen.  Games do resets all the time.  
---
Your analogy of Ted Bundy is just absurd.  If we go that route then its fine for one or two innocent people to be killed on deathrow for something they did not do!  Just as long as its not "everyone".
---
That's not a bad baseline, but honestly I'd say 1k per level is low, especially if you primarily fight Supermutants or Moleminers..  
---
Mole miners especially since the glowing often have (2) weapons.
---
They're strange at times, but when they "work" you'll have to search about 4/5 locations in an area (eh Savage Divide) to find a Horde boss. These days I can join and the boss has been weak enough to be killed by random location enemies like turrets. I joined, spawned inside that observatory with "the device" and loads of turrets, and the mortar broodmother was killed immediately and the event ended before the server had properly generated the terrain, my weapons, etc. They're weird
---
Follow I'm curious too
---
learn to play
---
Ahhh..  Yes.  Yes, that's the general sentiment.
---
I don't have a mule account.
---
A lot of innocent people are getting caught in the crossfire between Bethesda and the dupers.  it sucks being one of them.    
---
I'm more inclined to believe that Bethesda could fuck up an algorithm or accidentally ban someone over someone seemingly so dedicated to the game cheating.
---
It's called hoarding, literally every since item that drops I loot and scrap, and until "Black Tuesday" I would then dump on a mule (secondary) account 
---
Doubt it.  
---
I don't buy stimpacks though.  
---
They let off all the TSE/Bloodied and other weapon and armor dupers off!  They simply deleted the "extra" items.  Why were they NOT BANNED!
---
Fair enough, to feel that what you did was worth a slap on the wrist. Maybe you'll get yours back soon than others that duped to a worse extent. 
---
If it was an accident that you took advantage of once, a slap on the wrist is deserving. But in your case it was intentional.
---
Hopefully after noticing the damage it causes (like you stated) that will prevent you from doing it in the future and in future games. Maybe this is exactly what you needed to prevent you, I guess Bethesda is taking that approach.
---
Same here, I love the game but I'll come back ~~when~~ if everything is fixed. 
---
There's also a police uniform, hat and patrol glasses in the Monongah police station.
---
The email says no appeals will be considered, so it's likely they won't respond to him at all.
---
They did in FO4. With Rifleman related perks and buffed durability I'm hoping they'll be on par with combat rifles or hunting rifles for power and usability 
---
Well, I wish I could say I‚Äôm surprised, but it‚Äôs Bethesda, so I‚Äôm not. Good luck 
---
Why can't they go one day without fucking up?
---
Certain behaviors in the game award a lot of XP, other behaviors reward none or very little. How you spend your game time matters A LOT. My last 100 hours have gone into PvP and testing perks, gear and weapons with friends to get a better understanding of how the game actually works. You don‚Äôt get xp for that. Grind Whitesprings for a few hours (even after the xp nerf) and you‚Äôll reliably level every day.
---
They let off all the actual dupers who had multiple of the same weapons.  They simply deleted them down to only 1 of each item.  No ban. No nothing!  THIS IS STUPID!  WHERE ARE THEIR BANS!
---
Most of these "banned" posts are guilty of something it seems.
---
You spawn a fixed distance from the camp machine (about 30ft as far as I can see), but the direction you spawn in relation to it changes based on where you fast travel from. Where my camp is now if I fast travel from Watoga I end up right at my front door, but if I fast travel from Whitespring I end up falling off a cliff. The "distance" can also change if there are solid objects between the designated spawn point and the camp machine. It will shunt you a bit to find a place to spawn you, sometimes into walls.
---
Wallander fucking rules.
---
I got banned for being on the receiving end of some hacker giving me thousands of nuka colas. Never duped anything else, and actually stopped playing that character because of it. Now I am banned from playing a broken game. I am honestly not that upset 
---
It's as playable as it was yesterday, just not by you or other suspended players.
---
I read some people have a mule.  How does that work?
---
Would i need 2 xbox one devices, and 2 fo76 discs total $160 and log into both then run to meet your alt?
---
I only have one xbox
---
I should also mention - with what I'm describing you only need to do this once every other week for a few hours while you play and you'll never feel like you're about to run out.  This isn't something you need to do every day.
---
Doing events sounds like a good plan, thanks. 
---
"Nah this is just the latest LIE made up by dupers! Clearly you deserve the ban!"
---
-/r/fo76
---
Bethesda made so many mistakes in the past few weeks, can anyone really believe that they got this 100% right?
---
Jesus... full caps, shit just got real.
---
Wow that's so messed up. I read your other post and book marked it.  Upvote let's get this to the top. 
---
Forgive me, I meant Bethesda game, not BGS.  The company as a whole has lost some of my trust as a result of this mess.  I realize the Fo76 fiascos have not been directly involved with Bethesda and its affiliates producing games such as Rage 2.  However, Bethesda‚Äôs lack of support for the Fo76 community and mishandling of situations does in part reflect the possible outcome of another rocky release, be it from BGS, or another bethesda sector.  If your Ford f-150 starts having serous engine trouble, i doubt you are going to replace it with another Ford.  Even if its a Focus, which is developed separately from the f-150, 
---
Excellent; hope springs eternal!
---
Great work OP :) == ban
---
WTF do you guys do to people you dislike?! 
---
Prove it. 
---
Bethesda is taking action against players. To do that, they must have proof. Where's the proof? People don't have to prove they *didn't do something*. Bethesda has to prove they *did do something*. 
---
While some people say that you're wrong about the server thing, it makes total sense.
---
How many players did Fallout 76 EXPECT to have? 2 million? 3 million? 10 million?
---
They obviously wanted to accommodate all those players, just in case they hit a million simultaneous (like Apex did in the first week, last week). 
---
If we lowball it, let's say they only planned for 500,000 simultaneous players (about the maximum Fallout 4 got on Steam). 24 players to a server, that's over 20,000 "servers".
---
I don't know where you got the "player counter" numbers, and saw 1.1k players (care to elaborate?), but if that were anywhere near true, they'd need 46 servers out of 20,000.
---
That makes for a shit-ton of empty servers. They probably don't want to start closing them all right away, and taking any offline just yet (you know, in case the greatest modern miracle in existence happens).
---
If you want someone to help you with Warframe just PM me. I've played since the day it was released and I probably have a few thousand hours in the game. I'll give you some tips &amp; tricks and if you're playing on Ps4 I'll even give you some sweet weapons and mods to start out with! 
---
So... what did you do or get called out for by Bethesda?
---
I have benefited from duper items. I have had fun with the game. I learned that Monster Mash was a waste of time thanks to a duper on YouTube's video showing him spending over a hundred thousand candy on the top reward. I have a few TSEs, some sets of armor, some better than I even expected, and some other weapons that suit my builds. I love the game, but if I didn't have those items I'm sure I would have quit from the frustrations, disconnects, crashes, etc. and the poor loot system. I remember early on server hopping over and over all night one time, and just saying to myself it's ridiculous I have to do this to get these items. There was no other way for me to do it using in game systems. Whatever people think about dupers, they made my experience in the game better from the items I wouldn't have had after thousands of hours of nonstop grinding. 
---
I play games to have fun. And unfortunately with XP nerfs, loot nerfs, cap stash nerfs, it seems like they wanted to take my fun away by trying to manipulate me into playing longer. I don't like games that try to manipulate you to play longer by convoluted systems, time gating, etc. If I want to rush through a game and grind out nonstop for XP, caps, or for a particular item, there should be systems within the game that allow me to do that, and they are lacking and dysfunctional in this game. Most of us played single player RPGs. Fallout, Elder Scrolls, where we could play and mod and do whatever we want and hoard as much as we want. It's so wrong to punish people so severely when they are just playing the way they have always played. If people are having fun playing your game, then you should really be happy about that, even if it's despite every effort on your part t o make them play exactly how you want them  to.
---
You don't have to prove why you would do it.
---
You have to prove that you didn't do it. "Why" is not relevant at all. "Did" or "did not" is.
---
So this guy is lying and should go fuck himself according to you?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as0aea/banned_im_the_900_hours_played_guy/
---
Well if Bethesda doesn‚Äôt responded..and I post these emails and memos I‚Äôm sure somebody will.
---
I got hit yesterday and yup i had at 1 time about 800k candy that i picked up from some dude that dropped it.  Do I care? Yes a bit about 5 percent.  It has got so boring in end  game that i started playing borderlands 2 with friends.  Never did i bother ppl and I always posted SBQ fights to get loot.  All Bethesda is doing is getting rid of loyal fan base.  If I get my account back thats fine, If I dont thats fine too.  This game was starting to feel more like a chore anyways. So good luck to you all.
---
Occam's Razor?
---
Who said anything about them being organized? Have you played online games before where there were a lot of cheaters? People lie about the reasons they were banned all the time! People don't have to be organized to lie. Many do it naturally.
---
I mean, by your flawed logic, one might conclude that because we never see outpourings of messages saying, "I cheated and I was banned. I guess that's fair" would mean that all bans were false positives.
---
Read this. Its affecting innocents.
---
Fear not brother... they will soon be adding the timers to the map screen so you can see whether or not it‚Äôs worth travelling to the event.
---
So all these posts / comments about being unfairly banned are just people who got caught cheating??? I‚Äôm sure
---
It‚Äôs not a conspiracy, I know someone who isn‚Äôt a cheater and got banned for seemingly nothing, stop talking out of your ass and stop defending Bethesda, you are in denial. 
---
&gt; I get it though, Bethesda needs fans like you to not call them out and think they do can do no wrong. I love bethesda but they're not perfect.   
---
I get it though. Liars need people like you. You believe everything anyone posts on this sub-reddit and that they aren't just lying like guilty children that got caught for doing something they shouldn't have?  
---
&gt;And they're full of shit? You sure? Do you have anything to back up this claim that everyone is lying? Or are you too afraid to admit that bethesda may have possibly messed up here?   
---
Yeah they're likely full of shit. Do you have some evidence that they aren't? Just like the posters from the last ban wave, who claimed innocence and were (this will surprise you) completely guilty and then promptly stopped replying and disappeared once Bethesda stated there was unequivocally no mistake made in the bans. This isn't a new phenomenon, I've been watching/reading cheaters proclaim their innocence for over a decade, just to have community managers/game support confirm they're full of shit. People that have been banned have nothing to lose coming to Reddit and posting about it.  
---
Not to mention a buggy game and patches are one thing, it is entirely different to run a database query looking for 100k of a *rare* item. Not to mention they wouldn't clumsily ban a huge segment of the population if they thought they'd lose legitimate paying customers.  
---
Like I said if they're wrong they'll come clean. Be happy to come back here and say you were right? Don't believe everyone you hear just because they've got a sob story about being banned.
---
Did you or your friend claim a workshop on that server?  
---
In my experience that's the most common cause of surprise PvP.  
---
According to other ban emails from Beth (and hell, at this point I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if those were all fake) Beth listed the offending items and the numbers of those items.
---
Question for you personally. Is there anything lore wise that you feel was shoe horned in and should have been left out?
---
Was it a temp ban or a permaban? 
---
Wait so theyre banning people who are duping by banning who arent duping? Whoa. And can you point me to anything from any official source saying mule characters are against the rules or thats what the bans are for?
---
Summerville has lvl 5 super mutants and I have my camp not far from there. They give decent XP especially at low levels. Make throwing knives, clear out the town, loot all their weapons, scrap. I did this every time I joined a server for a while before I would start venturing out 
---
Yeah,... it's not hard to farm 10,000 Steel in an hour.. just saying.. speed farm West Tek and Rob Co. Run scrapper when scrapping and bam.. 10,000 steel scrap homie. Might want to run a LUCK/STR build and melee everything in 1 shot. All of west tek takes 3 minutes tops. All of rob co is like 4 minutes. Roughly 250 to 400 steel per run.. 10k in an hour is highly feasible.
---
Oh noooo...you did something to get banned...how DARE they ban YOU, the person who got a VAULT BOY TATTOO
---
500 hours in. Pvp all day. Never duped.
---
Account still working.
---
My son was banned!  The best reason seems to be that he bought nuka colas.  He probably got 100k of them for only about 20-25k caps.  He never duped but he did obtain obviously duped items.
---
Heres the kicker though!  They had all these accounts that possessed multiples of the same end game weapons and simply deleted them down to just 1.  Nothing else happened to those people unless they had 100k of an item now.  How is that even fair!!!!!!   Where are the bans for people who duped end game items?
---
I'm not saying it fair or right.  I am just  saying that wiping everyone is a ridiculous solution . 
---
The burden of proof cannot be laid on the player, as their access to their only evidence is now locked away by Bethesda.
---
Bethesda should be including the "list" of "rare" items of excessive number in the associated account in each letter, rather than only producing it AFTER THE FACT on request.
---
And of course that is the players only possible defense, as they cannot get access to the code or tools Bethesda uses to determine such counts.
---
Bethesda has stated publicly that only less than 1% of the playerbase was duping things in such a fashion.  Yet we are seeing a LARGE number of people posting here in the reddit and on the [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) forums that they've also been 'banned' in such a fashion.  Something isn't right.
---
I'm at work at the moment (on lunch) so I can't check to see if my account may be "banned", though I've never duped, never had any of the "rare" items at all, and my highest level character is 43.
---
If I'm banned, you are presuming guilt.  An algorithm written to detect 'duped items' is only as accurate as the developer who wrote it.  I'm hoping it wasn't the same dev who checked in old code and overwrote fixes with old bugs a few weeks ago.
---
Yep I got a ban email earlier. Wtf
---
Griefing is a state of the game where a player is forcibly engaged by another player in a situation he/she clearly doesn't want to be in. Why should "legitimately trapping" someone be rewarding to the attacker? What if I worked hard 2 hours a day for a week and lose my shit just because of another dude? If that was the whole point to it being online then it wouldn't have the limits that it currently has. This game isn't currently PvP-oriented. Rewards for even engaging in it are minimal at best. Why do you think there's no direct damage like in Rust, Ark or even Minecraft? Again- because the devs obviously don't think this game should be PvP-reliant. If PvP servers or options become a thing then so be it but right now its really not.
---
I mean- there's been like 3 top threads this week alone on this subreddit praising abandoned or lonely servers because of what? You guessed it- shitty online players. People sometimes don't even want to engage with players and I don't blame them. I mean just look at the last 2 videos I've uploaded. I'm not saying free open world PvP shouldn't be in place but what you want should be in a sepperate server in my opinion.
---
Some people want just the coop experience believe it or not.
---
1. Dupers have been creating mule characters to hold their thousands of items, so those accounts are being banned.
---
2. If they see that you're carrying thousands of a duped thing (or however they tell something is duped) then you're banned.
---
Can you not read or...
---
Yeah, when it was first announced I was as hyped as everyone else - it was my friends who had misgivings about it, while I was keeping a close optimistic eye on news and developments. If any of my friends had bought it then I might've done as well, but as things stand I'm really quite glad that I didn't. One friend has asked me if I'll buy it whenever it goes on a massive sale so we can play as a team, but honestly I'm more focused on Skyrim Together atm.
---
I suppose I'm still subscribed because I like to know what's going on, and yeah, probably hoping against hope that things will be improved. But I'm not expecting a miracle.
---
I am not I am more inclined to belive these people "unfairly banned" are full of shit until they prove they did not deserve to be banned. I have seen it too many times. On the GTA 5 support forums it was daily where ton of people would come post I got banned for nothing but if you actually saw their profile you would see where stuff like most MPH traveled in a car was like 900 to 1000 before any special cars with rocket engines were even put in the game. also where spent money was like 1billion yet they had not even earned a million in missions. not to mention their ranks would be over 1000 and ranks did not even go that high unless you cheated the system. 
---
Paging /u/lilcrabs
---
That is not actually that hard to do.  Getting those resources is not that hard.  Also, you can take the ammo factory and increase your rate of getting the ammo as well.
---
That sucks, wanted players should have a logout timer. Maybe not so much on people in passive mode.
---
All of the posts that started popping up first were shady to begin with and didn't get any better as more people came forward.  
---
They were all based on people supposedly getting banned with no notice as to why and tried to stir up community outrage over Bethesda not communicating with people... and then some people let it slip that they got an email explaining EXACTLY why their account had been suspended.
---
Whether this ban wave was automated or handled by humans the actual process of suspending accounts and sending out emails would have been automated.  If someone got suspended they damn well got an email, yet so many people conveniently left out that part of their story.
---
I'm 100√∑ sure this is due to their dupe fix where you can only have one of these things. What a shit show. 
---
I routinely throw away stacks of ammo upwards of 4-5k from playing mostly melee. so im pretty sure ive hit 100k of 45 ammo over the last 30 days
---
server hop..should be different enemy..took out a legendary stingray yesterday or whatever that bug is called
---
Can‚Äôt speak for the person you asked, but for me it was anticipation, then living vicariously because I couldn‚Äôt buy it at launch, and now I‚Äôm subscribed to this sub to check to see if it gets better. 
---
Paging /u/h3adshotfox77
---
Wow... Someone who duped, and admitted that the ban wasn't illegitimate. You are like a  unicorn! I don't approve of the duping, but at least you didn't bullshit us.
---
Link please because it pretty clearly sounds like  people who have duped but offloaded them to mules will have both accounts banned. NOTHING about  mules being inherently against the rules 
---
I would say the burden of proof is on people making dubious claims on reddit, not the company who has issued a public statement saying that these bans are not accidental (in response to people claiming false bans). Bethesda actually has real liability in this situation, whereas random Redditors do not.
---
So I'm gonna monitor this one because it seems like it could be legit and I'd love to know if this is really happening or if it's just more salt.
---
https://i.imgur.com/9Rccgzd.png - hope that helps
---
being subscribed (and not posting stuff) = lurking, fyi
---
Probably shouldn't have duped or accepted thousands and thousands of duped items. 1000 hours, what's that like 11 hours every day since it was released. You in a hospital bed like the lying 900 hour gimpy guy? 
---
Have fun, the game was dying, now it's dead, enjoy your super fast servers lol.
---
Fuck this game. Apex Legends and Anthem is superior any way. Apex is free. Anthem has real NPC and actual stories in it.
---
That‚Äôs hilarious. I think I‚Äôm going to have to find a friend and try this just to hear that sound LOL
---
Ummm I think your choosing to either be Willfully ignorant or aren't thinking outside the box.  
---
It's not about being pleasant, it's about the content itself.  
---
For example I'm one of a handful of people who've been actively tracking, documenting and reporting every bug, glitch, and exploit since day one of the beta (I reported a infinite XP loophole on day 2).  
---
So if I'm actively reporting bugs (You really should check out my [Bug Roundups](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aobkwm/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_weapons/), exploits, loopholes, reporting confirmed dupers (if and when I run into a camp and find a bag with 10,000 Nuka quantums) how would that logically benefit me in the long run, if I was a duper/glitcher/exploiter. 
---
The fact the OP (and I) are in the ultra minority means it's nearly impossible to do a direct comparison unless it's using another "Ultra-Minority"...  
---
It's like comparing a Savant to someone who's done something a few times and is proficient, the comparison doesn't work because of the scale of the difference).   
---
(Horrible but workable analogy of Bobby Fisher colored to someone who plays Chess a few times a year).   
---
Again I, and the OP, need to prove/disprove nothing because it's akin to a "[why do you hit your wife](https://www.google.com/search?q=logical+fallacies+examples&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari)" statement (extreme but again workable analogy)..  
---
There is no answer that can satisfy, and the argument is designed to make it impossible to prove..   
---
Jumping to the fo76 sub to check the front page is merely 3 seconds of effort. 
---
They are banning the buyers too.
---
I think there's a spot at the top of the Monorail Elevator where there are several bags of Concrete.
---
I had a little over 100k spread across all chars. No such thing as nuka colas and that kind of stuff.
---
In his case it seems like a permanent ban though.
---
I've gotten the email now. Got the whole duped 100k items within the last 30 days thing and I haven't even played in that time. Suspended til they have fixed duping apparently and can't dispute. 
---
Indeed, I always take any report of being falsely banned with a grain of salt. Reddit always shows their support, pestering GMs and CS representatives to get justice for the wrongly accused. More often than not said representative comes back with proof that the OP was a lying sack of cheating garbage.
---
But its the internet and people dont lie on it, remember?
---
No mods at all, it must be something in my connection if no-one else is having problems.  Just seems odd because PS4 runs fine on wifi and the PC is wired.  The game did load up, at least for a few seconds before disconnecting this morning.  
---
Performance really has been good since last Thursday's fixes.  Not a single disconnect all weekend.  Definitely improves the experience, that's for sure.
---
There's this cool thing you can do where you can look on the reddit here and read various posts and comments people have been sharing about getting banned, go do that. That's where I've seen it and where pretty much everyone has seen it
---
A lot more context is required for someone to extrapolate what happened to you.
---
Lot's of ways to flag for pvp.  
---
1st of all all Pacifist mode does is prevent you from accidentlybflagging for pvpnor bounty by not allowing you to damage a player or their camp.
---
What it doesn't do is protect you from a player attacking you.
---
They should be doing slap damage unless you or you friend attacked back.
---
*hugs op* hey relax 
---
Do you think they'd ban just on the word of a player with no evidence or any type of investigation? You could just submit a ticket anytime someone did something you didn't like and get them banned? That's be a pretty crazy system.
---
At least you got an email. I havnt had anything like 100,000 of any item in 30 days. In an isolated incident I picked up a baggy dropped for me for a queen run. Had 100k+ of bobbleheads. This was in December and I dropped them cuz that's sketch as hell. Lost friends over it too, trying to steer clear from that crap, as I've lost thousands of caps from workshop battles where ppl just one shot the hell out of me. That incident happened, and my ignorance at the time didn't help. But the lack of communication between company and customer is getting overwhelming. And if there is no road to redemption, and if I must be crucified for having picked up something for 10 minutes, so be it, I'll leave the game. But as it stands, I have no transaction history of my tricentential edition code on their website. (301) 926-8300 is their number, hit em up if you in a similar place as myself. 
---
I‚Äôve got proof they didn‚Äôt do any of this. My proof indicates that the game was never actually developed by bethesda and that this reddit is actually dedicated to a 3 movie Disney franchise and some sort of mass delusion is occurring. What‚Äôs an apocalypse dude? Why are not forth inter rest owerfore intelockinong?
---
The only thing I took out of this was that you got a cringy tatoo.
---
They said I duplicated items to an excess of 100,000 rare items in the past 30 days." Which I have to say, everything about that statement is wrong.. I buy/sell/trade.. and in my items I have only 1 of each.. seriously.
---
[Ps4] lvl 157.... just got this message too. I guess anyone playing the game is being included in bethesda's new suspension wave right now? Worked fine yesterday and today im locked out?
---
Anyone have any idea when our accounts will be reactivated / when bethesda will stop duping glitchs and allow the general public back online?
---
This post now has more upvotes than the known issues sticky.
---
I really hope this is looked into and not ignored. OP is totally willing to have his account details made public to prove his innocence.
---
Beth has provided no evidence that the OP violated the TOS. 
---
The people saying Bethesda can‚Äôt make a mistake *because algorithms* are blowing my mind right now.
---
Hypocritical? 
---
&gt;People who had duped or not duped, but highly benefited from someone who did, got suspended indefinitely over a month ago. Now you are erasing duped items and temporarily suspending people of same scenario. 
---
People who were causing majority of the games early server issues, pushing back development for the future of the game and costing Bethesda sales due to poor reviews (server related) got harsher bans.
---
The game was way less playable back when people were intentionally ruining it. 
---
Now they are temporarily banning people who affected the game to a lesser extent. Hypocritical, I think not. Cheaters do not deserve sympathy.
---
this, top of the elevator and in/around Vault-Tec Agricultural building 
---
Haven't thought about much, but yeah i haven't had a disconnect since the last patch.
---
I did nothing wrong..
---
Free Glorf!
---
I always find t51 pieces in the ash heap. 
---
Nevermind, just read your Chinese theory. Yes you would believe this instead of it just being a bunch of cheaters just got punished.
---
To be fair is it not suspicious to trade 500 caps for 20000 drinks that give a cap each
---
My sons account was banned as well.  He sold items for nukas and bought nukas for 1 cap for 5 bottles.  The real dupers are the only ones that should truly be punished!  The real dupers with all their TSEs and other duped weapons   
---
 and armors just had their stock reduced to only 1 of each item.  Where was their ban  [u/BethesdaGameStudios\_](https://www.reddit.com/u/BethesdaGameStudios_)?
---
Slow Down!
---
Exactly my point!  
---
Not done 10k steel and an hour, but gotten damn close in a few, 
---
When i take a legendary item out of my stash it triggers the legendary prompt. maybe their coding determines that moving a large amount of items into and out of a stash is the same as picking them up or crafting them and the metric is just something like "item x added to inventory, regardless of source"
---
Right, this one actually *took* place in the Bog. The gun is not absolute shit, though, it had only 10 points less base damage than my lvl 45 western, and does more now (on paper, haven't had a chance to use it) with a hardened receiver, so I'll give it a try. If it's capable to one shot blow up cars, it's going to be a fun sidearm until I find a better one.
---
I'm not trying to be a jerk here, but you should be aware that you are not communicating effectively. Just because you have a ton of time to write all of that doesn't mean that everyone else has the time to read it. Respect the time of your audience (if you expect them to actually read what you write. Keep to the point). Lose all of the unnecessary details.
---
Lmfao
---
Well I'm in successfully. Phew. Knew I wasn't a cheater/duper/exploited or general bender if rules but still was a bit worried. 
---
And Rainbow 6 siege had an accidental ban wave before. Not saying op is innocent but accidental bans do happen.
---
Said by the guy who got banned lmaooooo. Nice try
---
upvote for visabillity 
---
Hes off on a work injury and hours are added up just sitting at the login screen listening to the music.
---
The only thing fishy here is the blind Bethesda defense 
---
Not a refutation. 
---
we did not attack back. we literally just sitting on a chair and suddenly someone shot us. it only took him 1-2 shot to kill. So I wonder why. usually, when player shoots, i notice there's only a slight decrease in my HP. But this is different, More than half of my HP gone. 
---
I mean, this is easily the most entertaining trainwreck of a video game in a long time. Reading this sub has been a small joy of mine since at least October.
---
I don't mean to be mean, but the schadenfreude is real.
---
I‚Äôm sure their legal department will love the person who wrote this language...
---
thousands of players banned? Wow
---
This sub alone is the reason I skipped picking this game up all together and I‚Äôm happy I did.
---
It depends on how you're playing. If you're running a melee build with decent intelligence and using the "Scrapper" perk, you can readily acquire 10k steel in a single day. Assuming you're spending time in areas with super mutants, mole miners and scorched (which all carry weapons).  
---
At the same time, if you spend those eight hours with a commando or heavy machine gunner build, you'd be hard pressed to ever get a large surplus of steel unless you're specifically grinding low-level content or being very strategic with iron deposits and keeping up your acid intake.  
---
All that being said, I would never keep 100k steel in my stash, I would convert it to ammo instead. But that's a personal play style choice.
---
We did claim one workshop tho
---
Bethesda is not a court of law. You have no rights outside of the end user agreement. If you don't like it uninstall.
---
minecraft is fun
---
Yeah, just no story line NPC, just holotapes and notes abound.  I do like the level of content.  It's more dense in FO76 than previous versions.  I really do think now work was done.  The lack of NPCs is a perception problem that I think is hard to swollow for people.  Plus the human player base lacks quantity to fill in the world.  I don't know if this part is raw lack of players or too many world servers spitting up people.  The game needs 100 people running around to feel populated, and it doesn't have that.  There's no NPCs to fill in the gaps.
---
Okay. Prove they broke the end user agreement fam. 
---
&gt;Oddly specific.
---
It's not specific at all. Its literally a copy/pasted email sent to everyone they banned. 
---
Wtf? Why is it always the right leg? 
---
I think it's probably more than that. Look at all the posts people are making on the official Bethesda subreddit about being banned. 
---
This is why i stream and record every hour of game play, they shouldn't be able to hang you for something you didn't do. The fact that the constantly shrinking player base has to take  such drastic measures to ensure they dont get banned because of Bethesda's inability to cultivate an online environment is absurd to say the least.
---
What a joke. I remember being incredibly hyped for this game, and saying things like "Bethesda is one of the best game studios to ever exist"
---
And now I don't think I'll ever buy another Bethesda game ever again, especially if it has online.
---
Once again for good measure: What. A. Joke.
---
I had no excess junk and didnt collect or bought much, never had much nuka colas magazines bobbleheads chems or whatever, just a couple hundred fluxes I converted in serums.      
---
I am banned too. There are only 2 numbers I reached over 100k over 30days:      
---
- Trading value in caps (sold a few rare outfits &amp; may a dozen weapons)       
---
- Combined Ammo Count across all kinds of ammo (I consumed around 50-60k .50 over the past 30 days and only had a few thousand left, definetly not had over 60k .50 over 30days)
---
I had not thought about that.  I have often been annoyed by the same legendary message popping up when I move it from my stash.
---
&gt; If your Ford f-150 starts having serous engine trouble, i doubt you are going to replace it with another Ford.
---
Your analogy doesn't even apply to this scenario, since we are talking about different development studios. Bethesda SoftWorks being the publisher has almost nothing to do with it.  
---
If Rage 2 ends up being poop, then hey that's iD Software's fault, but I feel a little bad for them having to deal with the misguided thought process that you, and I'm sure many others, have since you don't understand the difference between a developer and a publisher. 
---
Says temp, but most of all who get that don't get unbanned ever as of yet..
---
Thousand upon thousands? There's been like 20 cry babies in the past few hours on here. Did you get banned or are you just adding flaming posts cause your bored?
---
I always thought the BOS was good 
---
I think the community garden in Flatwoods. - also any gnomes. 
---
Not meant in a mean way, but I think you're being reductive. In a defense case like this the first step is not to 'prove a negative', but to provide alternate explanations or reasoning/evidence to compromise the accusation itself, which would constitute proof of innocence. For example, one dude I was just replying to claims he uses 3 accounts at once to farm, so he could point that out as proof that it's possible for him to get so many rare items without duping. 
---
It's not an easy line of argument to make when dealing with mostly automated CS processes. But that doesn't really change my point that there's no other way forward but to muster as much proof as possible in your defense, rather than complaining on reddit based on nothing but scout's honour. :P
---
Sorry, but as a senior software engineer, EVERY programmer makes mistakes.  No code is "bug proof" not even simple searches.  Even a simple "SELECT \* FROM PlayerInventory" can give erroneous information depending on how linkage between views with joins is handled.  The idea that "it's impossible to make a mistake like this" is completely disingenuous.  And I guarantee they are using something created in-house, not a generic and well-established third-part tool.
---
I guess it was also impossible for them to check in an outdated code set to source control and rollback a bunch of fixes a few weeks ago too?  I mean, most source control won't let you do that anyway, right?
---
900 hour man has some posts about hunting down dupers and finding thousands of aluminum in their death bags. Maybe he picked up a ton of their shit in hopes of destroying it and that set a false flag. Maybe there is something he is not telling us. He has definitely been in the vicinity of mass duped items.
---
Many guilty people plead innocent.
---
Does that apply to the whole team?
---
I agree that may be too much.  But similar things have happened in other games.  They could give players a choice to restart with a wipe or be stuck in "Old Servers" that eventually will die without new players.  I believe Ark did that.
---
I always hurts when I have the clear photos for space
---
That‚Äôs because they cleared you out and only left you with one of each. 
---
This happened to me a couple minute ago lol
---
yep, the new thing to do is look for players who own workshops on the map. travel to you then have their teammates claim the workshop. when that happens you are open for pvp .
---
Could be 1 ticket is a flag, 3 or more tickets the account gets put under hard review. If you play the game a lot getting a bunch of tickets isn't hard especially if you're running around with mutations looking like you're hacking or something. New players could just not know any better. We've seen worse reporting systems from other companies. There could also be groups of people intentionally false reporting other players. We don't just don't know. I'm saying it's a more likely alternative than all the reports being false positives. Also Bethesda said they had no other way of detecting in game duping so it could be likely this is their way of putting a hard stop to it.
---
The people who post on subs and reddit are such a small portion of the overall gaming community.  This sub has 196K members, and there is at least a 25% downvote to this post.  Of that this post only has 112 upvotes. 
---
I would argue that the vast majority of actual players to the game don't care about turret bases.  
---
I mean, you have a completely different gaming community at Gamefaqs that may actively says that setting up bases there is a great place to set up camp: https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/240052-fallout-76/77463390
---
A quick search on youtube also has hits on how to build the bases, with all their upvotes and views.  Now do a quick search on "white springs turret base destroyed" or some type of search on why the white springs turret bases are bad and you will get no hits.  
---
Even looking at posts on the Bethesda forums itself, the opinion seems more split than what we are seeing here.
---
So yes, I would say that there was some amount of confirmation bias going on here with "what is the right thing to do" between a bunch of players on this sub, and No, I would argue that what upvotes these posts get is not any sort of evidence that as a whole, the community agrees.  Reddit has NEVER been the majority, at best on any sub it's the vocal minority of the game.  
---
If you don't want turret bases there, then go pester Bethesda to decrease the buildable areas around the clubhouse.  That would be the "right" thing to do, not playing pretend that you have some moral high ground to be a vigilante.  
---
No maybe they won't change it since they think this is good "drama" for the game, or some PVP game Design BS, but it is clear looking at the rest of the FO76 community beyond this subreddit that it is not as clear cut as people seem to be making out 
---
But when an 11 year old is given this great offer to make caps easy, its hard to pass up.  Its not like he was actually cheating!
---
No not in hospital, was just a hardcore collector and vendor.. farmed queen mostly with my group..
---
Hopefully the game becomes a Phoenix and rises from the ashes
---
Lol, you got proof... Put up or shut up.
---
This whole discussion about having tons of steel just reinforces pretty glaring issues with the game and resources. We go out and adventure, collecting things we need like equipment and important resources like screws, and so much of it comes with extra resources such as steel. 
---
The issue? There is no way in the game to utilize the excess. Cannot sell more than 1400 caps worth of EVERYTHING (scrap, aid, weapons, armor, etc) each day, and there is no way to use the scrap to build something that doesn't get scrapped when you log off. The CAMP has such a small budget you can max out before level 10 and everything you build in a workshop disappears when you log off or get disconnected. 
---
So, what happens to all the excess? It's either hoarded on multiple characters or thrown on the ground and eventually gone if nobody picks it up. The "rebuilding America" aspect of this game was a pretty big disappointment. I tried building workshops a few times only to get disconnected and lose all progress. I haven't touched them in months and don't intend to unless them get a major re-work. 
---
That is what he says, and I'm not disputing it. Rather, I am saying that this situation being put forward *from only his own word* is fishy, that there's a Black Swan here: something missing that'll paint a clearer picture.
---
I will wait and see *AND I RECOMMEND OTHERS DO THE SAME*
---
Are there any good single player alternatives? I used to love Elite, X, etc.
---
You have to pick up one of the Trifold American Flags - the ones in the triangular glass cases.  There's one in the lobby of Fort McClintock, for example.
---
RemindMe!  2days
---
&gt; It's also the only none PA helmet that has an armor rating.
---
Which is likely the reason it was removed. No clue why they chose to remove it rather than remove the armor rating, though.
---
If you've had 99,999 of them in the last 30 days apparently yes. Otherwise you look to be good.
---
maybe its Maybelline
---
It's mainly subpar gamers vs farming grinding enthusiasts on this arguement.
---
This is like the car scene.
---
I got a Stock Toyota Camry, it's good enough for me. It gets great mileage and blah blah blah.. 
---
VS
---
Have you seen my built 240SX with a 2JZ engine swap livery walk body kit, $8000 wheels a battle gang big ass wing that was custom forged in the pits of hell for $15000 ... blag blah blah. 
---
To each their own but dont say it cant be done or it shouldn't be done. They fucked up and didnt limit us to having a closed cap on materials held so our mule or storage characters are pinging their systems. 
---
Fucking lame. All day. Why aren't you guys playing Apex Legends or Resident Evil 2 or even date I say it.. ANYTHING on the Nintendo Switch kicks this game's ass. Done.

pick up a tri-fold flag, you can find one in camp mcclintock 
---
Accidentally getting this, is Bethesda's fault, not yours. Attempting to mimic this and getting multiple sets is your fault and is cheating.
---
This is me, too. I don't hate the game! I just can't enjoy it in it's current state, but I keep lurking hoping it will get better because those first couple weeks were fun.
---
&gt;At some point you have to use occum's razor and apply some critical thinking, is it more likely that a group of cheaters organized together and decided to make tons of posts about wrongful banning, or is it more likely the developer who has made a mistake every step of the way may have miss-identified a handful of players and banned them wrongly.
---
Is this a subtle joke?  Because this is BethesdaAustin we're talking about.
---
So, which is more likely - that a bunch of random people on the internet coordinated these lies with each other (with no leaks) or that BethesdaAustin, a company that has had a completely and utterly shite record at managing every aspect of the game, got too happy with the banhammer because they don't actually have records that can provide definitive proof of duping?
---
Yo, OP, I'm really happy for you, I'ma let you finish, but BethesdaAustin hasn't got one of the best track records of all time!
---
Same thing happened to me. Im glad im not crazy and other people have noticed this too.
---
Finally got it after giving up severhopping 20 times in watoga. Fast traveled to camp near solomons pond(?) And tried one last time at that PA station. Lo and behold, I finally got it.
---
I think this will end up being the reason. Moving stuff added up to 100,000 over 30 days probably.  Many of those banned judging by the sub had a mule (or two) 
---
https://www.altchar.com/games-news/587417/suspended-fallout-76-players-get-banned-from-all-bethesda-games
---
They are banning people just for crafting more than one item because they can't tell the difference between duplicators and non duplicators. There's no way to tell
---
it's a case of he said , she said, and Bethesda is a known to spread false information
---
\&gt; This isn't a new phenomenon, I've been watching/reading cheaters proclaim their innocence for over a decade 
---
This proves nothing
---
This game is TRASH
---
Same boat as you. I hit level 70 I believe, and really have no desire to come back until a (good) expansion.
---
I've completed all the quests I can, set off a few nukes, killed the SBQ, etc. but the end-game doesn't interest me at all.
---
That first sentence of the post...
---
Previous posts suggest he can‚Äôt stand the game or anything Bethesda. 
---
I posted that as a joke, I wanted to have some fun with conspiracy theories considering the game was going through such a rough time. 
---
The more posts like this I read the happier I am for buying Metro. 
---
That‚Äôs surprising to hear. Lot of people have been unhappy with it. It‚Äôs not a bad thing at all. Just interesting. I have Origin Access Basic so I‚Äôm gonna try it out when it gets released Friday. 
---
There's also one in the Whitespring gift shop. Downstairs from where people always fight the ghouls.
---
&gt; As an initial point, can we all agree that 99.99% of players across all video games on forums don‚Äôt admit to actually cheating.
---
No. You pulled that out of your ass.
---
&gt; That said, you could be the rare exception.  And if so, that puts the burden on you to prove yourself.
---
Lol fuck no. OP bought the game and Bethesda owes them the services they paid for. OP agreed to the terms. If Bethesda wants to accuse people of violating terms of use, THEY have to prove it. 
---
/u/NotacceptingPMs I'd love to hear your explanation to this thread then.
---
Try again fanboy. Cant rage when you have facts in front of you. innocent people are getting banned over nothing so how about you stop pretending like you know everything?
---
FWIW I agree with you, and you're probably right, there would be people riding the coat tails in that situation undoubtedly. I just wanted to supplement your comment (not disagree) by saying we should not allow Bethesda to brush this under the rug as an "accident." Accidents are unavoidable. Blanket bans that capture a "considerable portion" (define that how you will) of innocent players is a huge and amateur oversight. 
---
lol
---
This isn't a permanent ban. Read the emails people have posted. The suspension will be lifted once the duping method is fixed, which is likely going to be in the next patch or two.
---
Seriously, people are getting banned for just crafting and scrapping for mods right now, which is most likely what happened as I was trying to get the puncturing mod for the powerfist... nothing wrong..
---
Taking three seconds every day to check the front page a sub is perfectly normal... for a game you're actually playing.  Otherwise it's like breaking up with someone but a month later you're still checking their social media every day, it starts to get creepy.
---
I swear, your opinion of this game shifts 100% from one day to the next.
---
Yep I have seen it a few times here and a lot of other places. especially On the Rockstar support forums. That was a daily thing of tons of dudes coming on saying I was banned for nothing but I guess forgetting people can see their profile unless selected as private and you will see how they have spent way more money than have earned, also the fastest they have traveled in a car is like 1000 MPH and we are not talking about special cars.  and things like that where it's obvious they were using hacks and things of that nature. I remember telling a dude in a lobby once he better be carefuller spending that dropped hacked money he could be banned and both the hacker and dude getting the money called me stupid. The next week I was in the support forums and recognized the dude's name and it was the guy I warred about getting banned and there he was how he has never done anything wrong and yet he is banned. 
---
Handful of bags around the chem station in Harpers Ferry too...
---
So this guy is just lying then?
---
Pretty disgusting attitude you have there tbh
---
Just when you think Bethesda couldn't shit the bed even more, the diarrhea comes right back. 
---
Yup, just like doors and extractors, you have to build the lock.
---
They don't have to waste what little resources they devote to a failed game if they ban almost everybody still playing it. 
---
(301) 926-8300 this is their number, hit em up. Voice mail, but at least it's another way to try and get a damn response from these guys
---
This should only limit by the amount of storage on the device we are playing the game. Especially since the photos are only available on the PC they were taken on. I use teo different PC's and the photos on one PC are not available on the other! 
---
My dude. Nobody is going to come on this sub and post "Welp. I duped and got caught and now I'm banned. Bethesda did the right thing because I violated the terms of service."
---
If you believe these people, that's fine. But let's not pretend that if you're willing to cheat, somehow you wouldn't be willing to lie about it as well.
---
Why am I on a sub dedicated to a Disney movie. Curse you bethesda!!!!
---
Yeah. People are just giving those away also.
---
Moral of the story.......you need duped gear in order to cheese the queen in 3 minutes.
---
I‚Äôm online now so just HMU when you‚Äôll be back on later
---
Yeaaaaaaah, I don't believe you. You got banned cause you did something you weren't supposed to, like duping
---
I've looked up the mission, do I have to redo the event every time I want to turn in a daya?
---
Thank you guys so much! I just assumed I had to find one and click it lol
---
Oh okay then 
---
Last time I found one was in the lab at Garrahan Mining
---
Cant stand a bunch of liars who ban people for no reason. Hate on me all you want. I will always stand up for the defenseless. The people who are the least advantage in this game
---
Are locks from a plan? 
---
You might want to not use mules anymore as it really seems like an exploit
---
I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll great right on it. Just like they done a stellar job fixin the entire heap in the first place. 
---
I knew about doors and extractors.  Just never thought you could do it to windows too.  That's good to know.
---
E:D can be single player, just select solo mode and you won't run into other people.  There's also a "private" mode where you only play with folks in a group you join, and "open" mode which is just everybody who selects open.  
---
Personally, I always play in open.  You'll get the occasional griefer who wants to kill you for no reason, but it's not hard to escape from them once you've practiced doing so a bit.  I can't remember having ever been blown up by another player when we weren't fighting to the death by mutual consent.  There's also no real reward to griefing, most people except for newbies are just going to escape, and occasionally you're going to bite off more than you can chew with somebody who's ready and able to kick your ass, plus you're racking up bounties every time you fire on somebody who didn't fire at you first and generally make your own gameplay more annoying.  :P
---
So yeah as you can see I generally advocate playing in open and most people you'll come across are cool, but for those who really just want a single player experience, just click solo when you login.  
---
I rest my case
---
This is what I don't get. Why can't *some* of these people be telling the truth? Why do they *all* have to automatically be judged as liars *immediately?* This doesn't sit right with me. 
---
I'm a very dedicated player myself. They players like us. I would have the same reaction if I were banned. Hopefully they will fix you soon. 
---
Nope, I only had one of each ever. Ppl who got there stuff reduced didn't even get banned!!!
---
Any chance you ever picked up vast quantities of an item, either found/bought/given to you?
---
With all that flamer fuel you have the right to be flamed.
---
In context, I'm still skeptical that anyone is running the scrapper perk and farming specific enemies for anywhere near that much steel. I can't even fathom why anyone would keep that much steel if they could earn it, especially given the stash size restraints in this game AND the warning of bans related to mass accumulation. It just doesn't add up. 
---
However, if you're right and 10k steel can be farmed in a single day (still seems unlikely to me because 1000 steel per hour is bonkers), I would admit that hundreds of thousands ~could~ reasonably have been farmed since launch. ;)
---
Let's be real.   Bethesda has unfortunately been messing up left and right with the game.  The most likely scenario that makes sense is that once again bethesda messed up and innocent players are being banned.
---
What makes more sense.  A bunch of dupers got together and decided to try to force bethesda hand Or that a company who's been messing up almost every single day since launch messed up again? 
---
Same. If I run up on him quick enough. 2 or 3 power hits and it's KO. The one time it spawned as a legendary was a lot tougher. 
---
It's not only his own word though? We have screenshots of a copy pastes email saying the same thing to people, with reputable people like OP being affected.
---
I guess its fishy since you have confirmation bias and just want to assume every is lying and they are all DuPeRs who deserve it
---
You are 100% correct.
---
Todd Howard alt account spotted
---
100k caps from trades is a pretty good sign someone in the transaction was duping something. The cap limit is 25k.
---
That one dude came on the sub was like "welp. i duped and didnt get caught or banned" so theres that. 
---
Collision Course event at the Morgantown airport gives, as I recall, 11 concrete as part of the reward.
---
Call a lawyer, the best lawyer. Tell them you can't play a video game because of "rules." 
---
But...but how do you know who's innocent and who's not. Nobody provided any prove. Not Bethesda not the banned players. All we got is the "I've never duped, I've never met or traded with a duper". 
---
Strength-based food, chems, weapons and armor. 
---
I need all of the BoS plans!!! 
---
Oooooohhhh that explains something that happened to me recently. Luckily it wasn‚Äôt a great weapon but I did notice that one of the two shotguns I had in  my inventory was replaced by another one when I finally completed the prison quest 
---
I won't discount it either.  I like my wombats... er... Ark  
---
Just saying I'm not going to be nearly forgiving with a AAA dev as I am with lower tier devs like "Unknown Worlds" subnautica or Wildcard's "Ark".  Especially when frankly, both those games for all their faults, are less buggy and more playable than fo76.  AND as you stated, they treat their customers far better.  
---
For a AAA dev to sink so low on so many fronts is pathetic.  We shouldn't have to compare them to A or B level devs to make Bethesda look good.
---
Yeah... In glad I've passed on this one. Seems like a total shit show.
---
Accidentally? Yes! That was the truth, that existed!
---
But that's not an exploit, that's a bug. If it could be done intentionally, reliably and on-target we would have seen proof in a YouTube video.
---
My point is that a bug is not an exploit, and we were convinced that it was a much bigger problem than it ever was. 
---
&gt;  That‚Äôs surprising to hear. Lot of people have been unhappy with it. 
---
I haven't really been following any news regarding it tbh.   The load times really suck, especially considering I have it on a SSD, but other than that it's been night and day compared to FO76.   With FO76, so many things were sucking, that I ended up scouring forums and seeing the pain.  With Anthem, I have little need to alt tab out of the game.   I've had a few bugs, like losing sound in game, and a few crashes, but with 25 hours now in game, I could count those bugs on one hand.  
---
With Origin Basic, you get 10 hours of time before the release.  I highly highly recommend it.  Just grab a book, or have your phone available, if you don't play this on an SSD.  The SSD (it's an m.2) barely makes it tolerable.  
---
Game developers shouldnt punish players for their mistakes
---
Early on I picked up all the weights in a work out room and was overweight...lol it sucked... most I‚Äôve ever found was maybe 20-30 scrap but if it‚Äôs junk like at WS, I usually guard it for them to come back.
---
So this guy is lying then, according to you? Pretty scummy attitude you have there.
---
If I'm bored I also go through and drop 1 thing at a time in the trashcans spread throughout whitespring.
---
Watoga Shopping Mall, Phoenix always has two bags of concrete and one bag of fertilizer lying around (as long as nobody beat you to them).
---
This is fucking obnoxious, I really shouldn't be surprised a main quest is bugged in a Bugthesda game, but boy am I real fucking tired of it
---
Pretty pissed the way this was all handled. Past 30 days. Nothing close to 100,000 of any rare item. I have 3 pieces that I see circulating all over the place. They pry duped. But I bought em for my characters. Now gna be held hostage for a week and I'm just gna walk away from this game. Tired of ppl just taking my cash, putting me in a hard place with server crashes and lost items from it, workshop pvp robbing me blind from TSE pvp before I got my hands on one to defend myself, then ignoring me entirely.
---
Cool, when it happens to you for no reason maybe you'll remember me.
---
How do you meet up with your other characters?
---
Do you really think if *hypothetically* a company wrongly declared that a consumer broke their license agreement that it couldn't go to court if the consumer wished?
---
One guy did come on and admit to duping. 
---
"I will be inputting support tickets non stop all day today."
---
Well, don't stop just because it's a new day!
---
I'm generally on your side but mistakes do happen (from GuildWars2): https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/akrvhm/vindicated_anet_admits_it_made_a_mistake_and/
---
Tell me again this guy is full of shit. Tou people are actually disgusting. 
---
Much better Analogy, thanks, I think it's spot on.  
---
Why? I'm an addict with a stubborn streak, it's why I bother responding to some of these insane comments ;)
---
Should change the title to "solved: not a shit person so I logged in fine"
---
How does Bethesda? they can't possibly know who has duplicated and who hasn't. They have also not made any sort of statement about who has or hasn't. they simply claimed that they would be cleaning out all duplicated items from the game. But instead, now they are banning people completely at random. Read the article.
---
Path of Exile is also free and more in the vein of Diablo 3.
---
Stop defending cheaters, you are in denial.
---
I think it requires a 2nd person . You drop items into a box while they‚Äôre online , then log out and in to your mule and fast travel to your friend to pick them up .
---
ahh yes criticism, like taking a potential cheaters word at face-value as truth for no particular reason (which absolutely has never happened before, and especially not here on this sub, ironically even leading to said-cheater admitting to 'looting large quantities of duped items', and people still blamed bethesda... no, that didn't happen at all) and then basing this to go off on a tirade about how tired and bored you are about the game and how valid your criticisms and opinions are.
---
such a 'mere' expression coming from someone just 'wanting to see the state of the game'. i'm not going to say something petty like 'grow up' because i think your words already convey those words to you yourself quite well.
---
reddit loves fallacies, so let's drop some here: strawman fallacy; what-aboutism; appeal to probability ('well it's bethesda so it's more likely they fucked this up!'); the argument from fallacy (that just because something has been done wrong in the past, then this thing must also be wrong), but not limited to those. i'm actually impressed you managed to squeeze in so many fallacies with such disdain while simultaneously pretending to champion the idea that you're here just to "check and see the state of the game".
---
if you're so partly representative of this sub and so easily influenced by a little salt and some sob stories it's no wonder this place is such a constant downer. the email that banned him said he had over 100k items accrued over a 30 day period. that's 3300 units per day. 137 per hour. now if we assume you sleep 3 hours a day, eat and shit for another hour, and have no job, you'd be sitting at 20 of gameplay. that means you have to get 165 of something a day. we're not talking about just anything - but a singular item. and not one day, or two days, or even a whole week, but \*obsessively\* to the point of medical emergency (20 fucking hours a day? WTF!) for a whole 30 day period.
---
you think the above scenario is more likely? than the fact that this guy probably duped; considering this game has been rampant by a crazy amount of duplication, with countless of video and image proof, with bethesda admitting it themselves.
---
but NO. of course this is another \*duh bethesda dumb'. of course this is just another pristine opportunity for you to share your 'mere expression' (i am sure it enriches your life so much to have a constant eye toward something you apparently hate and love so much). great job dude. which, by the way (ironically), is such hypocritical drivel; because there you are, sharing your disdain for the "expression of opinion and not the opinion itself" then go on doing the same damned thing to the guy who just shared you his opinion.

---
Lol they're just gonna ban whoever is left playing the game for no reason so they can pull the plug.
---
 We very much enjoyed your original post! My wife and I play the same character/same account. We are raising a 2 yr old and are slow to advance - time limited to play. We are truly grateful for you and others like you who are so willing to share your knowledge (or sell us your serums/advanced weapons). It saves us a ton of time we‚Äôd rather not waste scratching our heads trying to figure out optimized playtime. Thank you!
---
Lmao
---
&gt; What makes more sense. A bunch of dupers got together and decided to try to force bethesda hand Or that a company who's been messing up almost every single day since launch messed up again?
---
That a bunch of cheaters banned are using the negativity about the game in general to get even.  Seems pretty likely to me, as it has happened before.  (Mass craftng/scrapping will get you banned!)
---
Any time you claim a workshop you have knowingly or not invited a PVP event, no matter where you are. That means it's not just for the 30 seconds it takes to claim the workshop (which is what I thought initially) but anytime anywhere on the map whether you're at your workshop or not. Chances are someone saw you owned a workshop they wanted (or maybe they're just jerks), found you on the map and ganked you for teh lulz. That's the risk you take when you own a workshop.
---
And just HOW are they supposed to provide that evidence?  They cannot log in now to take screenshots of their inventories.  All the other mechanisms to show innocence is locked behind Bethesda's tools.
---
Call one of those tv lawyers that are on during soaps. They have to know video games. 
---
You've never killed a duper and picked up all there stuff to swap servers drop it and swap again? I even had one message me to say he would have won without Damage bug and ask what my weapon was.
---
If the game ever gets improved to the point I feel like playing it again i'll see if I was banned for that lmao
---
BINGO! its not just the dupers. Its the mules, traders, and buyers too.
---
Don't fret, I've bought lots of legendaries from vendors, even explosive guns, and I could still log in this afternoon.
---
Somebody suggested the bans might be connected to mule accounts / chars. I only ever traded plans and some stimpaks with my alt, so I hope that constitutes fair use?
---
So how do you explain the people on this subreddit you are claiming that they never did anything of the sort? How do you claim the news articles circulating out there that they are banning people for creating more than one of any item?
---
The Order of Mysteries quests that have already been mentioned are fair game though. You can upgrade your rewards from that. 
---
Just don‚Äôt sell/drop the low level rewards because the recipe for the upgraded versions will require the original!
---
&gt;What makes more sense.  A bunch of dupers got together and decided to try to force bethesda hand Or that a company who's been messing up almost every single day since launch messed up again?
---
It's 2019.  Both are equally possible.
---
So your friend would PK dupers, loot them, and then have duped items on him and got banned as a result?
---
Sorry I'm making assumptions but I'm curious what happened to your friend!
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ made me laugh longer than I probably should have at that 
---
amazing how everyone is willing to just believe that these people are cheaters. No explanation, just bandanas been late with no chance to actually see any evidence. We're supposed to just take Bethesda word for it, a bunch of liars?
---
Pretty much.
---
Its a BS game, not BGS.  BGS is a developer - and not even the developer of *this* game (that's Bethesda Games Studios Austin, halfway across the country from BGS).
---
However, its all owned by the same people and its all published by BS - go ahead and cancel that pre-order to punish them.
---
Though, frankly, DON'T FUCKING PRE-ORDER GAMES IN THE FIRST PLACE!
---
I've never seen anyone use the flamer... I got one and it weighed like 40 pounds so I scraped it!...lol
---
How do we know they are reputable?
---
Further, I never said they're lying. I repeat: I NEVER SAID THEY ARE LYING. Rather, I said we should wait and see before jumping down Bethesda's neck about this. 
---
*The one with confirmation bias is the one who blindly believes people on the internet about someone else.* 
---
Wanting to wait and see in order to get a clearer picture is not confirmation bias; on the contrary, it is wanting to avoid bias.
---
I totally understand that broke a few ribs in a motorcycle accident. All I had was video games and YouTube. Even then it drove me up a wall that was all I could do for a few months.
---
Thanks for the clarification! I made 8 corn soups yesterday and was like, I think I made to many lol (: Now I know why the servers seemed so empty, lots of banned peeps..
---
yes
---
got not more than 1000 scraps in toal over past 30 days for free ; bought just 200 bones, 400 lead and 300 acid + 100 stimpaks... so really nothing worth mentioning at all
---
Well because anyone can lie and say they didn't do nothing.
---
did you get a notice that your workshop was being attacked
---
Camp McClintock has a couple, I got mine there. I found 2 there, 1 was on a shelf behind the sgt gutsy on the 1st floor, the second was in the main entrance room. 
---
Hey, what about cross-save/progression? I mean, that would be useful for those of us who are switching platforms, and being able to play with friends, while keeping the same character. Not exactly cross-play, but close enough for the time being. 
---
u/lonevaultwanderer
---
Don't know the others but those are the most reactive anyway.
---
THANK YOU!!!@
---
No, i havent. I dont trade w anyone but vendor bots. And i dont pick up suspicious ammounts of stuff.
---
that or the SLA time resets itself because of an update to the ticket (albeit on the wrong side for an update). which means it wont be setting off any systems for alert
---
Adrenal reaction, nerd rage. and a few other "activates at less then X HP" perks
---
Is this why I keep seeing a Blue Genie that looks like Will Smith
---
And of course you realize I know this. And my post was created with that in mind. With my point residing around the fact that despite what he may have been doing, we‚Äôve played the same amount of time, and yet he is still double my level. 
---
Unless he was grinding white springs all 900 hours, which his post detailing all his farm areas contradicts, I doubt he achieved that level legitimately.
---
If your Ford Truck doesn't work right, are you still going to buy that Lincoln?  They're both owned by the same company.  They both have the same upper management dictating what happens.
---
It sounds like you're lucky you can still play. If what everyone says is true, that is.
---
I'm on ps4. No way we can macro shit like that. Who the hell would sit there and mash x for 8 hours a day
---
Dupers sell to Vendor bots also
---
Um, are you okay?
---
20 hours from the time you first sell to their faction.
---
They are reputable due to their extensive post history and benefit to the community. Bethesda employees literally gave then commendations.
---
Why do you assume they are not reputable as a baseline?
---
I'm sure they have proof but of course you can't just post it publicly when you are a big company. 
---
IKR? I went deep-streaming subtitles too. 
---
I bought it at R&amp;G or Harpers Ferry a month or so ago. 
---
I‚Äôm also on PS4,  but I‚Äôm traveling for work. I could make you one next weekend if you don‚Äôt find it before then. 
---
Why would they have to wait until the next patch if Bethesda is banning people now? Your lie makes no sense.
---
I‚Äôm not banned of course I ‚Äú really ‚Äú didn‚Äôt cheat so I didn‚Äôt expect to be banned . 
---
This is really shameful of Bethesda.
---
Yikes. OK cool, good to know!
---
dupers crying about being banned lol 
---
Why not show us the email where they detailed all the items you had stacked? did it not look so good? 
---
Oh hey, another fanboy who won't believe anything other than Bethesda who are a bunch of liars and have been proven time and time again to be liars. hundreds of people have evidence that they never cheated at all, but hey, let's believe Bethesda, the people who have lied up and down about every aspect of his game. Lied about the canvas bags. Lied about what the game would be like, or what condition it would be in. Lied about everything. But hey, let's just trust them!
---
"Welcome to Watoga, City of the Future!"
---
Wait, your evidence is a blog site? 
---
a blog site written by someone using an alias and refuses to show their real name to stand behind their "journalism?"
---
This is a great time for you to step outside, take a breath, live a little. I weep for you. Not because you are banned, but because your lack of life.
---
Dynamite 
---
You cheated.
---
End.
---
A different perspective is not indicative of 'willful ignorance', and I have no reason to 'think outside of the box' here. I'm not the one being accused so there's no need for me to think dynamically in your (or anyone else's) defense. :P

I will readily admit that someone who debugs and reports a lot of issues is less likely to be a duper. That's the kind of proof I think is usable, though you'll have to forgive me because I'm not going to research your post history to find that stuff out. That's kind of an unreasonable request to make of a stranger on the internet, haha.
---
To get to the main point, and to your last paragraph, you've already answered your own question. I just wrote something similar in a reply to someone else, but providing proof of innocence need not focus entirely on proving a specific action was not taken. All you need to do is create reasonable doubt and that can be done using the kind of proof you just gave me here: Your history of helping Bethesda. If you can bypass the automated processes you may well get a fair shake based on that alone. If I were part of their CS I would certainly flag that and look into it.
---
As to the people who have no such proof to help them out, it becomes a bit of a 'tough luck' scenario. Not in a jerk way, but just in the sense that it's simply not reasonable for posters to come here with sad stories expecting the community to help them out. We need to maintain the demand for proof and reasoned argumentation, otherwise this entire situation and others like it quickly degrade into 'he said/she said', and frankly, I will take the dev's word over some random internet poster, any day.
---
And yes, even in the case of Bethesda, haha. They do mess up but that's not intentional, whereas cheaters will intentionally lie-- and I think most of the people hit by bans are indeed cheaters, so as a basic numbers game it makes no sense for me to suppose the folks posting here are innocent because they say so.
---
In the end I hope you can work out a good resolution, and I hope you understand my position better. 
---
I'm taking all the posts with a grain of salt. Not many people would openly admit doing something wrong but I also wouldn't put it past Bethesda to ban people by mistake because of some automated system 
---
Wow this is not funny anymore. Please keep us updated. Holy shit this is a mess. 
---
there are rare outfits up to 25k... also some very good, rare weapons. The cap limit is just way too low. That's why most people prefer trades instead of sales for caps.
---
And it all just works, if course.
---
Got my account frozen for having a bunch of junk i nabbed from two dudes duping at the isolated cabin, at least they could have told us this was coming so we could burn the items.
---
What a little ass you are.
---
yet, you are here
---
Is there a "how to" farm Gene's? I played with someone that had marsupial last night and it looked amazing.
---
Surely they are required to post it privately to the banned users though? Otherwise it's just depriving them of their paid 'content license' (or whatever you wanna call it) for no reason, something which is a no-go in the EU anyway.
---
I don't think so - you back out of item placement while staying in the camp editing menu and look at a door or resource generator and one of your options should be lock.  On XBOX it's left trigger or left bumper, then you choose lvl 1/2/3 (more resources for a stronger lock)
---
Did you not read the rest of what I had to say?
---
Agreed.
---
mods change every login for me, even if i hop to same server. some mods are more common so you might think its the same selection.
---
The old 'I cheated because of you' bit.
---
I'm gonna go with the one with a recent track record of failure.
---
The bug still existed, and people had a right to be concerned if the was a chance people could take their things unfairly at all. Even if it couldn't be done reliably it still could happen. 
---
Your original point was that the bug was some kind of hoax made by a rival company when it very much existed. So no saying the bug "wasn't as big a deal" doesn't mean it was a hoax. Nor does it mean that Bethesda is under some kind of attack and that these reports are false. 
---
If Bethesda was capable of making a system that wasn't riddled with errors we wouldn't have a bug list as lengthy as we do. Yet we do have a large bug list because Bethesda keeps dropping the ball. It's entirely possible that these people are being falsely banned and people like you help no one by saying these people deserve to be banned when you know nothing about their situation at all. It's not a hoax, Bethesda needs to fix their system, again.
---
Cool.
---
Good luck convincing all the Fanboys hear of that. Anyone who attempts to disagree with these aggressive Fanboys is getting the synth treatment. 
---
LIAR! HE'S A LIAR! BETHESDA ISN'T WRONG ABOUT ANYTHING! THEY'VE NEVER BEEN WRONG!!
---
Just friendly feedback. I am indefinitely suspended, and I have only a single character on a single account.  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 
---
Plenty will say "yeah sure, you cheated and don't admit it, etc." That's fine, hold your opinions and such, believe what you want. I know people who duped and I tried to stay out of it. Bethesda has decided to suspend me indefinitely anyway, and I don't much care anymore. I was just waiting for vaults to see, just maybe, if there was a chance this game could be fun and worth playing, and my decision was made for me.
---
Aka, ‚Äúthis game would have been way better if they‚Äôd have just made it single player‚Äù. 
---
Or people are telling half truths. No one ever lied on the internet
---
"I traded with shady persons"
---
Kinda explains it.
---
funny, because I have seen emails with much more details than what was posted here.
---
That one poor guy who is still working on the game only get 1 day off when people don't want to tear him apart. 
---
That is helpful! Server hop didn't change anything, but if I fully close the app on PS4 it should reset?
---
I can't wait for the YouTube videos where the YouTubers white knight the cheaters again.
---
‚úã
---
Just wait. It'll get worse when you get banned for no reason 
---
I've been playing a lot of Warframe lately. It's pretty... annoying for a f2p player early on. REALLY limited slots for equipment is a major buzzkill.
---
But it's a really fun game though. I'm enjoying it, although I do have a leg up because I got grandfathered into a bunch of good stuff since I played early on.
---
I just dont see how that makes any sense beyond trying to defend the game.
---
Bethesda has been messing up left and right since launch and quite frankly doesn't deserve the benefit of the doubt in any of these issues.
---
I think the super mutants in Appalachia should've been left out. It is explained why they are there but it just loosely makes sense and except getting something new to shoot they are completely useless. The BOS in 76 is somewhat fine tho. Another thing which always annoyed is how they conpletely retconned the lore for power armor. I don't mind that they work different now but why the hell is the X01 pre war or why does the T60 exist. Bethesda explain
---
&gt;No one ever lied on the internet
---
I read it on the internet, so it must be true.
---
Lol. Feel you. Hopefully it becomes a great game. They just keep screwing their playerbase every other patch
---
I know, right? Been sitting on a set of T-60 (sans right leg) for about a month now also....just more concerned with the t51 for now strictly for the paint job
---
Reddit is not a legal system. If a player feels they were wronged and have been damaged, then they should follow the support system and if they cannot be made whole through working with customer service, then they can take it up with an actual legal system or maybe with their bank or whomever to look for money back. That would be the proper thing to do.  
---
When individuals make posts like this we are not in any position to do anything about it or verify from either side.  What is the desired outcome?  For us to harass bethesda to lift the ban on this person that we don't know?  To force Bethesda to put out all this game data so we can verify that the person really did something bad, like game data might even mean something?  How would they be able to do that without leaking personal information about the person? Anyways, and then what?  What if the data verifies it - the person could say "that's not my data", we're back at square one.  
---
22+ years of MMOs have taught me that the % of people who get caught up that are actually innocent is usually minuscule, but it doesn't matter anyways. I can't do anything about the ban.  What good is saying "You have to believe me" when I can't do anything anyhow.  (and ignorance is not innocence, and trying to be a vigilante and picking up the 10K items someone was trying to move to a mule and chucking it somewhere else does not make you innocent)
---
And when you get the ban for no reason feel free to remeber me.
---
It's honestly the best solution. Let like play with like and they'll boost each other's experience in a positive way. But make PvP play with PvE and you're going to get people crying about griefing (which PvP is *not*, but to a PvE player it probably looks like it) and no one fighting back.  
---
You can even be twee about it and call them "Cooperative" or "Combative" servers. Make everyone on Cooperative servers play in pacifist mode with wanted only coming from something like actively stealing from other player owned, locked containers. And conversely, everyone on the Combative servers is automatically in permanent PvP mode with no slap damage.
---
Only downside is that PvP servers are going to be hell on earth for newbies. Especially if you lock characters to PvP-only or PvE-only settings.
---
So, they are banning the people who still play that trash game? That's insane to me, what else will they do to you guys?
---
Why can't it be both? Reduce and then ban??
---
ITT: dupers complaining. 
---
!! Fuck all you dupers and aimbotters!! Shoulda played legit u pieces of shit. I haven‚Äôt even met a duper so don‚Äôt give me that ‚Äúpicked up 100000 steel‚Äù BS. I‚Äôm lvl 200+ and haven‚Äôt killed a duper and I pvp everyone
---
Any particular locations in ash heap area?
---
I run (3) Accounts on the same computer...
---
That's not in my post ....
---
To be fair, it takes a long time to fabricate something that looks close to believable.
---
I believe all deserve equal punishment.  Temp bans until duping is fixed.  Yeah, right.
---
Lol comment when it's up
---
I was astounded at first, then seeing how many people do, I stared to wonder if I was in the minority for not going through all that trouble and maybe didn't see the value of doing so. 
---
I actually agree with a lot of the points you make. At the same time, if each email they'd sent out told that specific consumer what they specifically did, I'd feel a lot better about it. But in the end, that's just me feeling a certain way, so I guess you're right.  
---
Neither did I..
---
While fighting the mongrels you alerted one of the many Mutant-overran Raider Camps in the Savage Divide.  And Super Mutants tend to swarm their enemy as soon as they know they are there.  Entire camps, entire buildings, worth of Super Mutants will all run to attack.
---
This is an incredibly well thought out and worded post, so much so that for the first time I have bought coins to award to a post.
---
I haven't tried logging on since before the TSE nerf, but I have also benefitted from duplicated items despite not duping myself. I was very active in the player to player economy in several subreddits and LFG, and I bought and sold dozens if not hundreds of items, many of which were likely duplicated.
---
I have a similar play style to yours. I actually enjoy the grind of looting, scrapping and crafting. I have water purifiers and an adhesive farm - all unlocked for everyone to enjoy using. Had 150 purified waters on my toon today, hundreds of gears and screws, etc. No problem logging in and I have no worries about it.
---
There's also the fact that the human player base has no real RP tools to fill the world with. We can't create settlements or generate quests without a lot of finagling that just doesn't make it worth it. If you want humans to replace the NPCs, you have to let us create things like quests and jobs.  
---
Chainsaw Flamer. I've heard a couple of Watoga vendors sell it.
---
With actual dupers not being banned, and Bethesda's track record, I believe you.
---
(301) 926-8300 customer support number
---
So glad I never wasted my time or money on that dumpster fire of a game
---
Well this sucks. I craft marine wetsuit helmets because it takes zip in materials, they weigh nothing, and they sell for 19 caps a piece with my shit charisma and hard bargain. I was able to log on at lunch to do my vendor run but I guess I need to find another cap source. With super duper I've been crafting 65-75 a day for the last month.
---
The only real way is the same as in FO4 - place the wires first and then put the walls in.
---
Otherwise the walls will block wire placement.
---
Other than that - look at the connectors.  I don't know if vanilla has 'through-wall' connectors or not.  And finally, some of the connectors and connectors-on-posts radiate power so they only have to be in the vicinity to power things.
---
I wonder how one can prove their innocence though. Unless they've been streaming/recording all their game play it would be a hard thing to prove unless of course Bethesda posts their "proof" of the cheating.
---
Yeah, he probably is. It's possible with that much play time he's simply an extreme outlier that got caught by the high limit they set, but it's doubtful.
---
browse [/new](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/new). Feels like half the posts are people getting a email saying they've been suspended due to having more than 100k rare items in a 30 day period. Seems Bethesda is locking out people with impossible quantities of Nuka Cola. Not just dupers, but those who may have trafficked with dupers or been foolish enough to take thousands of items found in a bag/suitcase.
---
You're forgetting this is a team game, my Heavy Gunner doesn't play anymore but between me being able to survive doing a Nuke with literally only a Blackpowder and the melee bros he was able to craft a insane amount of Bullets.
---
4 Peoples worth with ammosmith+Superduper
---
&gt;4448 gunpowder, 8340 lead, and 16680
---
How much do the FO76 Nuke Launching weightlifting rooms have because we'd do like 3 runs in a row and clear it out everytime. 
---
I agree with you there. But Bethesda has made a public statement that claims of false bans are unfounded. They have a lot more liability in this situation than random redditors.
---
I dont see how you can say "there is no benefit of the doubt to be had here" when that's what you're doing.
---
Could all these dupers gotten together and collectively decided to conspire against big bad bethesda? Sure.  It's just highly highly unlikely IMO.
---
Could Bethesda have messed up again like they have seemingly every week since launch? Sure.  They've messed up countless times so until proven otherwise I'm gonna go with the most likely scenario that Bethesda made a minor error.
---
Will do
---
Eh, I don't think your numbers add up: best case you farm a place in 5 minutes (server swap time etc.), and best case you get 400 steel per run. That's less than 5k steel in an hour. 
---
Aside from that math conflict, my main point isn't that it's absolutely impossible to get 10k/hr ~somehow~. Just that the requirements to farm that much steel + the motivation to farm that much steel + the storage to keep that much steel + not reducing when warned of the bans and how they work = a lot of unlikely things piled up. And that makes me very skeptical!
---
How dare people stick around in the sub hoping the game improves!
---
Yeah idk why it's being pulled from game view and not being drawn from device storage. 
---
Sincerely, why do you do you doubt it other than the fact that you‚Äôre a different level? He specially stated that he‚Äôs spent most of it grinding and even published a guide to grinding materials and legendaries via killing enemies.
---
I have two characters, one is 100 and one is 125. Less than 500 hours played, and I‚Äôve never actually *tried* to level.
---
Before the glowing ghoul do nerf (which was fairly recently) they‚Äôd give upwards of 700xp before inspiration perk or other XP boosts. When I did Whitesprings before I could get a half dozen levels in one nuke and that was with no Xp buffs (5% from cranberry pie and 15% from inspiration does a lot!) but I would get bored half way through one run and do something else. 
---
It makes sense to me that doing dedicated nuke farming pre patch could get you a couple dozen levels a day. Even now you can level several times in one nuke there.
---
WHAT hell NO no
---
Will edit more in after I read OP
---
Amen
---
Did that after the 6th week from release. I really dont regret it.
---
I want to love it so bad, but Bethesda makes it harder ander harder to see the good in the game and them... and i say that as an incredible Fallout and Bethesda Fanboy since Fallout 3 (see my name and account creation). Or rather i should say i "was" a Fallout and Bethesda fanboy.
---
I still love the older Fallouts but Bethesda sure lost my trust and i just cant like 76.
---
It most definitely wasn't me.  I only kill people I feel deserve it. I've met a few others running around with the Halloween skull suit on and it definitely does seem to attract the assholes lol
---
Oh, no wonder. I thought it was weird when specifically super mutant hounds attacked mongrels and then me. Thanks.
---
Thanks! I appreciate it.  Bethesda removed this post from their discussion forums, so I hope it offers a unique perspective of someone who was not banned but will admit to benefitting from those who have. I hope my narrative gives a clear picture as to why it's important to point this out rather than just a simple, "I got banned" post.
---
And a lot of the people trading rare outfits and rare weapons duped to get them, or duped to get the caps to pay for em.
---
When people brag about weighing tons and still playing that admit they duped, that‚Äôs wrong.
---
And I feel bad for anyone you persuade to buy a game made under any Bethesda affiliate with your inability to understand simple analogies.  The publishers job is to fund and support a title.  I have seen very little support or intervention from Bethesda in this fiasco.  Perhaps it is you who doesn‚Äôt understand the relationship between developer and publisher.  If we allow all blame to be placed in the development studio and leave the publisher without blame, companies could continually pump out screwed content without consequence 
---
Solomon‚Äôs pond, in Power Armor rack beside water purifier. What system ?
---
If you are on Xbox I can make you the arms and chest
---
Maybe after they do the balance pass, but they aren't really useable in their current state.
---
An out-of-nowhere wave of banning.  The support emails people are getting claim they were banned for having *more than 100k* of one or more rare items.
---
Tons of people are saying they've never had 100k *of anything*.
---
So its back to a 'he-said-she-said' situation with a developer that doesn't have any better a record of open communication and competence than the people claiming to be banned mistakenly.
---
Six non cheating turds, sounds like it'd be a good time to be honest. 
---
Why are you on this sub if you've never even played this game?
---
no one believes you, bud
---
Full app closure didn't seem to work. I turn the console off and see if that has an effect.
---
Yah bro in cause u havnt noticed Bethesda has been trying to commit suicide since the launch date of the game what did you expect 
---
The Responders and Minutemen are very similar and the Responders even kind of rebuild an actual government if it wasn't for the scorched. The Minutemen questline in 4 always felt like an origin story to me. For example the NCR also only exists because the Vault Dweller cleared a cave from scorpions and rescued Tandi and now they are the biggest known government in the wasteland. It wouldn't surprise me if Bethesda wanted to do something similar with the Minutemen. The fact that you can't under any circumstances actually destroy the Minutemen supports that. Maybe in Fallout 5 we see the Minutemen when they are a proper government.
---
why are you here?
---
PC. And I really want the plans so I can craft my own. 
---
But thank you. 
---
You clearly never farm for massive amounts of ammo then. 20k steel is a drop in the bucket for me on a farming day.
---
Maybe that is it. It is not the dupers that got banned but rather the people greedy enough to pick up thousands items and moved it into their mules. And somehow considers that they don't deserve a ban for it.
---
I find it funny how this is the Sub that is reporting mass banning, but the other subs I frequent, not a single post....
---
Almost seems coordinated.
---
Almost.
---
I really wanted to build a camp on Death Claw Island, but it wouldn't let me. This will have to do since I just got marsupial!
---
So your in duped gear i imagine?
---
Until they get false flagged and banned lol.
---
Certainly looks like a four-step plan by Bethesda:
---
1. Eliminate duped rare items
---
2. Suspend those with large quantities of the preferred money laundering currency
---
3. Patch the duping glitch 
---
4. Reinstate the suspended players
---
I suppose those suspended should be thankful the fourth step exists. 
---
There's a thing in the game that looks alien-ish. It disappeared before I could kill it, so all i remember is that it was purple and called monster. What was it, alien or some strange mutation? Also, how do aliens fit into fallout, since I remember one appearing in 4.
---
Server was just lagging
---
Just move the photos from your drive. Or better yet, setup a dropbox type of service and sync to the cloud.
---
untrue. i have mule acct. both are fine. and mule has  a  poopload of junk and ammo.
---
They also took our money for a broken game and then banned us without proof. I get it, you all don't believe any of us, and that's just great for you. But for those of us who adamantly avoided duping or taking duped items, well, *we still got the shaft*. 
---
If Bethesda could solve their problem, they wouldn't need to ban people for it. They are just adding one more to the list of fails. But hey, the good news is that they *must have* gotten at least *some* of the cheaters in the process, right? 
---
They complain on here so they can duplicate reddit posts at least
---
Awesome, thanks! On xb1, will check this evening when I get on.
---
have fun with your ban, duper
---
I constantly get thirst and hunger penalties because I don't tend to eat or drink until I see that I'm low on either one. I bet a ton of other people play the same way.
---
\#derp 
---
Did you have to log in before getting the email? I'm level 128, but the only thing i got a lot of is ammo. I didnt dupe or anything, i just hoard it. I just crafted like 1k of 5.56 last night tho.
---
I know this is all bullshit because I have been collecting identical legendaries that wouldn't normally be duped. Up to 3 Anti-armor Fire axes with improved power attack damage. Not to mention thousands of rounds of ammo and legit Nuka Colas
---
This is the quality content I live for. 
---
cry, duper. you won't be missed
---
Yes, lesson learned with this one as far as pre orders go.  I suppose my positive experiences with pre orders can never outweigh this disaster.
---
No mans sky isn‚Äôt so bad anymore. Ironic to mention here in this subreddit. 
---
I agree with that analysis
---
"Draco_86, I've come to bargain"
---
I‚Äôm posted up on a cliff near a lake. Just counted 7 floors in the batcave I‚Äôve been able to make with the campfire-concrete floor trick. Might be able to get in one or two more. I‚Äôll check next time I log in to see if I can find the max.
---
yep im pretty srue ive seen it at the trainstation. 
---
Why do all the whiners have to complain about problems that aren't theirs?
---
Checks out
---
I dunno. Everyone was gloating on here for months about how Bethesda was too stupid to know which items were being duped. Turns out they not only knew, but were letting that false sense of security shake out which players were egregiously breaking the system. They set the threshold pretty freaking high for mistakes to be made. 100,000 of anything is absurd. If any bans were illegitimate, there has to have been some effort to get those accounts unbanned and I want details of at least one person that went through that process before I make a judgement.
---
Maybe you just haven't been banned yet?
---
got to keep the cycle going lol
---
I play "within the rules" too and haven't been banned, yet. But I have a feeling I have had a lot more enjoyment and fun dancing around the borderline of the rules.
---
Thank you for understanding the simple and clear analogy others could not.  Also bigger thanks for clarifying, Lincoln-Ford is a better example, though I forgot they were connected tbh.
---
Why does Bethesda get the benefit of the doubt when they've messed up every single week since launch? 
---
If even 1 person got banned but didn't dupe then that's an issue that should be adressed.
---
The pack mentality is so weird in this place.  
---
I play on console. 
---
The alien you saw was the Flatwoods Monster. It's a Zetan alien. They exist in the Fallout universe and even have a spaceship that orbits the earth which you could visit in Fallout 3. They are mostly used as easter eggs but are a proper part of the lore nonetheless. There are a lot of theories concerning the aliens. Some even state they might be responsible for the Great War...
---
Well you would be lying if you say a portion of this subreddit isn't just here for the drama.  
---
cry, duper
---
Please do a rework to the respec mechanic of the game. It causes the game to be even grindier then it needs to be. 
---
"This decision is final and no appeals will be considered "
---
Ah yes, the Bethesda Duper trials of 2019. 
---
"Your honor, I saw a man, and he had lots of items. He was super high level too. His name was u/Glorf12
---
"Lots you say? That wont do at all. It is settled then. u/Glorf 12 I hereby sentence you to be banned at the stake for the crime of dupecraft"
---
Nope. I play with what drops for me. Never traded with anyone other than a vendor bot.
---
 what the $uck is oatmeal 
---
&gt;To do this, they need proof. Players don't have to prove they didn't do something. Bethesda has to prove they did do something.
---
Why?  No, seriously, why?  I'm not defending Bethesda here - in fact I think they've pretty thoroughly shit the bed with this game - and the developer certainly hasn't earned sufficient goodwill and trust that I'll take their word for it but this isn't a criminal trial. This isn't even a civil trial.
---
In the end, this is their house.  Their rules.  Don't like it, leave.  Don't come back for their next (Rage) party.
---
8 hours a day is child‚Äôs play tbh. Aside from that he said he had a work injury and so can‚Äôt work. In that situation 10+ hours a day is extremely easy.
---
Yeah I suppose like the transition of Shady Sands into the NCR in Fallout 1-2. 
---
Oh I forgot about the Institute, they are kind of cool. 
---
Brotherhood is the only way to go though! Ad Victoriam! 
---
Can you quit complaining about this? You posted just 45 minutes ago... pace yourself.
---
Me too, kinda. I get an almost mandatory 'Your camp could not be placed' notification when I login. Quit, then get stuck in an infinite loading screen when I attempt to select Play. I've determined it's easier to just close the app. Less hassle and actually faster. Would be nice to be able to play the game within 5 minutes of the thought, though.
---
Some guys at Bethesda: 
---
Guy 1: "this guy's says he played fo76 900 hours"
---
Guy 2: "haha, very funny" 
---
Guy 1: "no seriously look"
---
Guy 2 : " WTF something has to be wrong here. We should probably ban his account until we find out figure this out" 
---
Guy 1: " I mean, somethings up. Has to be"
---
It can be both, absolutely hilarious some people are trying to come up with some grand conspiracy by other companies to "smear" the publisher. False positives and claims are fairly common when massive automated waves happen. I mean really? Other devs paying for this kind of astroturfing? How delusional could you be?
---
I‚Äôm not a duper dude and I can play the game...so your comment was a waste of time and a lack of intelligence on your part.
---
I guess I should be thankful I'm not banned, with the amount of ultracite and ammo mats I collect, and the amount of ammo I craft, and occasionally the amount of aid I craft. I do nuke runs as a service, then come support the fight with the queen. That leads to a lot of ultracite, flux, and repair/ammo materials. 
---
While it isn't specifically spelled out, I don't see how you can think using a second character to BYPASS the stash limit isn't an exploit.  It may be widespread practice, it may be socially acceptable but it is %100 an exploit.  You are bypassing a game mechanic through unintended means, that's the very definition of exploit.
---
If you believe the "di en due nuffim" crowd, you are dumber than them. 
---
Bethesda already came out and said these claims of innocence were bullshit during the last ban wave.
---
Alright cool. I guess this is gonna be a days long endeavor, then. Turning off the device didn't work either. What on planet Earth were they thinking with these vendor and world object reset timers? Totally bogus.
---
He has a pretty bad injury and is off work to recover. Read his previous post where he explains 
---
Why is claiming bolded?
---
I use 3 star Tenderizer perk card in Charisma for part of my melee build.
---
Dunno why you getting downvoted, but also false positives happen too. Its not perfect, but there's always people being banned who lie too.
---
This game had so much promise..... 
---
A lot of people were banned that didnt admit to duping. But almost all of them admitted to knowing dupers, playing with dupers, buying and selling duped items, and having insanely overloaded alt/mules.
---
Duh, dupers.
---
I was banned as well and never duplicated an item.  Believe me or not Idc.  But I'm sure I had a couple duped weapons I traded for.  But that hardly warrants a ban ? 
---
&gt;So its back to a 'he-said-she-said' situation with a developer that doesn't have any better a record of open communication and competence than the people claiming to be banned mistakenly.
---
poor cheater is upset about getting caught. give us your best "din due muffin" paragraph in all caps! 
---
oh. 
---
Why are you acting so condescending?
---
Yikes wall of text
---
This is the point I'm trying to make. Thank you. 
---
It's the first sentence you wrote
---
Having the event inside glassed cavern is a good idea.
---
Well i never duped, all i did was pick up a dupers loot bag that I found in a nuke zone. Thats not against the rules, why should i be banned?
---
I never said it wasn't doable for ammo, just very unlikely and would require dedicated farming to pull off. I also highly doubt that normal ammo was one of the rare items on their list. Fusion cores maybe, but not bullets.
---
 you've been gnomed 
---
2019: when stating reality is "condescending" 
---
Maybe if the drop table wasn‚Äôt such bullshit people wouldn‚Äôt feel the pressure to touch every legendary in arm‚Äôs reach.
---
If you don't understand what a theory is, then you are dumber than me.
---
Because cheaters wouldn't lie right
---
people won't know it's the same person. Also, if he gives all his high powered stuff to his new Smurf account, that would be a very unfair advantage over other Actually New players. 
---
I hate Smurf accounts so much. 
---
I forget the name, but the radio satellite array place with the muties near Westek has a flag behind the front desk. You may go through it doing one of Rose‚Äôs quests. 
---
To give the impression that the word "claiming" is indeed in the sentence.
---
you thinking that people will believe your bullshit and actually feel bad for you shows "a lack of intelligence on your part." 
---
It's my favourite aspect of the fallout games. I don't leave nothing behind. Bit harder in this one because of the stash limits and I'm always juggling things round. But still managing it. The stash increase in the next patch is very much welcome. 
---
I agree my brother was banned and I know he never duped not one thing on the game. He also hasn‚Äôt played since Christmas.
---
All he had was a mule with a lot of steel,cement and Stimpacks. He kept a lot of steel because he would move camps spots and he used the metal building for his camp.
---
This isn't a court though.  
---
"have also done no trading or mass dealings in the past month+, stopped associating with the wrong crowds"
---
Admission of guilt accepted. So you are mad it just took awhile?
---
but I didn't say that....
---
or maybe I just didn't want to write **lying**
---
I doubt it because I read his guide, I saw nothing new, no new methods that haven‚Äôt been mentioned here a dozen times over. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not possible, I‚Äôm saying he had to of only played in nuked white springs the entire time for him to be that level. And as his guide clearly shows with his location circuit, he didn‚Äôt just farm  nuked white springs.
---
I managed to do it, just stash all your scraps into your stash, it‚Äôs all good 
---
I am not banned or suspended. I‚Äôm speaking actually facts. So I‚Äôm glad you assume to know everything. 
---
Of course not. Part of my point is asking why everyone has to be a liar. 
---
Why are you crying on reddit then? To get people to "support" your lies about not cheating? talk about pathetic 
---
Because BethesdaAustin wouldn't make a mistake, right?
---
Alaa I‚Äôm on XB1X. But thanks and happy Ski Slaying!
---
Worth also noting, is the type of Armor and number of pieces is random. 
---
" How do you prove \*you\* weren't? "
---
By not being banned from the game?
---
Also their email said I was banned for using a duplication exploit.  Which makes no sense because I have never used one at all.  I just hit level 182 after around 250 hours of playing 
---
Cranky because you got banned, aren't you
---
the BoS bomber with the orange pants? i wear that with urban operative and its ok.
---
get a lawyer so he can laugh at you for $150+/hr. 
---
you cheated. you got banned. stop crying on reddit. 
---
Yeah 1000/hr seems bonkers but melee can pile up steel extremely fast. Imagine a simple circuit:
---
Blackwater mine (mole miners)
---
National Radio Array (super mutants)
---
West Tek (super mutants)
---
NRA Research Center (super mutants)
---
General's Steakhouse (super mutants)
---
Harper's Ferry (often super mutants or scorched)
---
Morgantown High School (scorched)
---
Penitentiary (often super mutants)
---
Shotguns (IIRCC) can return 12 steel per with Scrapper. There's easily 80 enemies in the above circuit (one of several possible). All of those locations have immediately available benches to scrap at and decent enemy density. If you're focused you can do the above in less than an hour. So someone casually farming (hehe) can certainly do 5k steel in a day and farm 100k in 20 play days. A power gamer should be able to do 1k/hour but sell their soul a bit to keep the grind up.
---
On the other hand, if you spent the same amount of time farming Whitesprings and the Queen, you'd never be able to sustain a Commando build, and even a melee's steel intake would be 1/10th of the above.
---
ya, everyone who isn't a cheater. 
---
I never robbed a bank. I just picked up the bag of money i found in the street......
---
Yea, see how that goes?
---
+1 to this, a 2,000 hour and counting Elite Dangerous Veteran here. It is extremely difficult to pick up, as it has a steep learning curve, but once you get it, it is just an amazing, gorgeous game.
---
Well that‚Äôs great. Can you please not make excuses for a guy that‚Äôs being a jerk then?
---
your reality and the world's reality are apparently different
---
This isn't really a good thing for the game. Servers shouldn't be empty.
---
If they're going to start to ban over mules, then they should probably tell what's left of their playerbase that they do not endorse mules and it's a bannable offense like a proper developer.
---
you fucked boy.
---
I don't know if its that glitch where when you kill an enemy it stands completely still or if you are that much of a risk taker. besides that ALL HAIL MOTHMAN.
---
They‚Äôre probably banning everyone so they can shut the game down without officially doing it maybe? Lol just ban all players maybe?
---
gets banned. cries on reddit. people don't believe him. cries on reddit &lt;---- that is literally you 
---
Different monsters do tend to be aggressive toward each other.  Scorched and Ghouls fight constantly.  Half the time I go to Camp Venture on of the ghouls in the lower half gets spotted by the scorched lookout and they all start fighting.
---
I don‚Äôt think super mutants like anyone.  
---
I smell something. *Sniff* *sniff* 
---
...is that bullshit? 
---
"facts"
---
you must be a post modernist. 
---
no that is just how the jacket is it comes with that orange suit no way to change it
---
According to a lot of people here, your friend must have done something wrong. There is no way Bethesda is banning people wrong. 
---
Don't you get tired of posting this crap?
---
&gt; three times in a row just to craft ammo
---
Nuke Silos
---
&gt; I also highly doubt that normal ammo was one of the rare items on their list.
---
Sure but i could have hit that limit if they counted consumables since I was literally the only one in my party with Lead Belly/Party girl/ Cola nut while buying out the Whitesprings Booze/Cola venders with my huge Charisma every chance i got and having my team do the same.
---
I don't blame people for not doubting possible dupers saying they've been banned with the track record of the game so far unfortunately  
---
I pick up just about everything and scrap it.  I end up with over 1000 steal in far less time than it takes me to level up.  I bulk it and sell it.
---
Watch it be something simple like dirty water or wood scrap.
---
It is most likely would be under Wall Decoration.
---
bro, your theory is stupid. 
---
The way to fix this is to remove the display of player level over the player‚Äôs head. It doesn‚Äôt help anyone. It doesn‚Äôt add to the game. If anything, to know that a certain player is able to do a certain thing, via level qualification, then make it a color, or stop broadcasting player leveling at level 50. 
---
" I often use 2 accounts to transfer items between my characters "  
---
Dude, this sounds like you are guilty of duplicating items and then passing them off to mule accounts. 
---
\&gt; You have banned the only legitimate player base left playing your game. I  will be inputting support tickets non stop all day today.   
---
Fucking what? That is a waste of EVERYONE'S time. Do you not know anything about how this works? Your best, and only reasonable bet, is always to have one active ticket per an issue at a time. Not only does this have the benefit of not making you look retarded, but no one thinks "maybe I should ask a supervisor" before actually helping you.  
---
It's a twat move. Don't be a twat.
---
Except I never got banned but you keep acting like a keyboard warrior tough guy
---
Aha! Thank you very much. Clear and concise answer, I appreciate it. 
---
I‚Äôm a 52 year old man...  
---
unless it is a light sign
---
There isn't an absence of evidence either way; Bethesda banned based on evidence they have. The fact that they're not sharing that evidence with the public in no way dissuades me from believing they evidence, because it's common practice to keep that knowledge private. So I think you have a fundamentally flawed premise there.
---
Past actions can and should be used as proof intent, and that may help these folks. They should definitely submit any evidence of their actions to help the community. 
---
Your last claim is less credible, or perhaps less relevant. The game is buggy, yep. The detection process could be buggy too, yep. Which leads me to think some people are likely innocent, as is the case with every ban wave by every dev, regardless of the game's quality. And that's the point where your assertion becomes meaningless... the fact that some people are innocent does not in any way support the innocence of individual cases. 
---
No Man's Sky's current state (which is great!) is due to developers that didn't give up on their game. They kept at it and have made it 100 times better than what it was at launch.
---
One can only hope that Bethesda gives as much care to FO76 in the long run, but I'm just not seeing it.
---
That's more plausible. 
---
I have a couple of problems with the situation right now
---
* Like I said, in my time playing other MMOs over the years - from Everquest to World of Warcraft, the majority of the time the bans were legit. sometimes you could feel bad for the person - sometimes they aren't in the know, or worst case they join a PUG with someone who is cheating and get banned with it - but most of the time, they had \*some\* hand it it.
---
* Bethesda has had a lot of issues with this game, I wouldn't be surprised if there was some major bug with the game or script that banning people incorrectly.  But so many of these posts are just coming off as the most knee-jerk reaction.  For example, there was one yesterday that I thought sounded odd, and then a second poster commented and only later claimed to have played with that person.  It came across as a sneaky attempt to call to action. 
---
* In my experience, the guilty parties tend to scream the loudest. If you were innocent, you are pissed you basically had $60 taken from you - but you know you didn't do anything so you tend to follow the standard customer service path.  If you are guilty, you also suffer from your embarrassment which tends to make you try to deflect, make excuses, or feign ignorance.  
---
* Those banned are not trying to provide any helpful information for us to figure out any common themes.  Now granted, this game is \*weird\* to say the least with how it's built, but even things like system - what are some major weapons you were using, did you happen to have a TSE weapon, were you suffering from the bug where things in your camp duplicated, did you play during beta, etc.  Give some useful information so we can try to consolidate it and see if there was a common theme,\*\*THEN\*\* we would have an argument back at Bethesda that people could back.  (e.g. If we see a common them of people who had hundreds of corn plants in their CAMP because of the duplication bug then yes - I would argue on behalf of those people) - if we don't have it, the best we can do is have bethesda double check.
---
TL;DR - If someone is banned and they truly believe they are innocent, go through the proper channels first.  If that doesn't work and you really feel driven  to post, then make it a calm and collected post, provide whatever details you can about things you think MAY have triggered it, as well as some basic troubleshooting information, and leave it at that.  People are going to be more opt to believe someone with a thoughtful and well documented post over "OMG BETH IS THE WORST I JUST GOT BANNED BUT I NEVER DID NOTHING"
---
Also the troll factor cannot be ignored, people love stirring up drama and the drama about this is starting to reach a fever pitch to the point I think that the mods should simply create a megathread on the people who were banned so they can post their information there - all in one place to be reviewed - and remove those posts from the main page as that would help reduce the troll factor.  
---
I agree. It's crazy people are still eating the BS Bethesda feeds them.
---
Nah. I'm at work. I don't think you have anything to worry about. The more I think about it the more I think this is targeting ppl who may have traded with dupers. 
---
I didn't realize that the bomber jacket displayed the orange jumpsuit under it regardless of what you have equipped. Figured out now. Thanks!
---
bro, does your mom pretend to believe you when you lie? no one else does. welcome to the real world that doesn't care about mommy's princess. 
---
Don‚Äôt dupe. Don‚Äôt glitch. Don‚Äôt buy items that r duped. Easy formula to follow. I‚Äôm lvl 200+ and I‚Äôm not banned. I haven‚Äôt killed any duper‚Äôs either and stolen their loot. Dupers r smart enough not to engage in PVP so don‚Äôt give me that BS u cheating fuck. 
---
Huh? Your intelligence is showing. Not once have I ever said anything about cheating.
---
Also the whole dumpster fire comment is a bit dickish. 
---
If we were to talk about what's pathetic you'd be the topic of discussion.  
---
What's wrong? Have nothing of value to add so you resort to insults? Spoken like a true r/FO76 poster
---
meh.
---
Has Bethesda actually ‚Äúmessed up‚Äù any mass bans?   No.
---
Have cheaters lied about being banned?   Yes.
---
Doesn‚Äôt take much effort for a handful of hurt cheaters to make the few ‚ÄúI‚Äôm innocent‚Äù posts we see. 
---
at least you are honest. 
---
Doubt
---
OP's defense is that he played a lot so he couldn't possibly have cheated??? Really?
---
Okay, try this on for size. I also was banned. But I swear I've never had 1000 items. I even bought the game again but they knew and banned me again. This is the truth. Please believe me. I also played 400 hours. I'm outraged. You see? I'm a victim too. I would never lie to you. I didn't cheat. I did not.
---
Seriously tho, I've had the game since BETA, and there was a definite shift in players' progress and level after duping became prevalent. It gave certain users a competitive edge over everyone else and they skyrocketed up to end game content. Who is more likely to use these exploits than the guys playing this game like it's their job? OP thought he could get away with it, was wrong, got banned and has come here to win in the court of public opinion (where the truth and evidence don't matter).
---
I hear you, but I disagree with how much time you‚Äôd need to farm Whitesprings to earn the extra 100+ levels.
---
Pre-patch with 15% bonus xp from inspiration and 5% from cranberry pie you could level incredibly fast at Whitesprings. So fast that they nerfed it from 700 to 100. That‚Äôs a huge ass difference.
---
I mean how much of your 900 hours did you spend farming glowing ghouls there? How often did you use xp bonuses? Differences in levels doesn‚Äôt have to translate into exploits.
---

I logged in on my ps4. After dinner. I've checked for updates. Restarted ps4. Checked internet connection. Made sure maintenance wasn't a thing. I have friends playing the game right now. And nothing online. The only thing I could find was I might need a code? Like you would do for DLC but to be able to play the game I have been playing since the beta. And I got the game from gamestop. But had it shipped to me. The error code is as the picture shows. But just incase this is what it says. fallout 76 login failed this account is not authorized ps4 4:8:2000 I hope we can figure out why I'm unable to play. Thank you.

üëΩI sent another message because I wanted to give as much information on what I've been doing as I could. Even though I hadn't gotten anything back from them yet. But as far as I can tell. I'm not banned. As they said. It's just suspended till wheneverüëΩ
---
I have looked into the the issues that Bethesda is saying I have done. As far as I can tell it seems that the anti cheat system goes off of how much I've crafted. I couldn't find anything on time frames. So idk if it's looking at an overall statistic of my account. But that would be kinda silly to me. I also couldn't find any information on exactly what the system considers as a rare in game item. For all I know that could be plastic or rubber or leather or something like that. And then bulking up could be the cause. I'll give you the information that I have on what I've been doing in the game though. So as to attempt to figure out where the problem is at. For the past probably two months. I have been constantly scavenging. I had made it my mission to help low levels. Ive made a ridiculous amount of wet suits, pocketed leather armor, weapons. Ammo, rad away. Rad x. Healing salves and so on. I've also been constantly moving base. And re building. Breaking this thing down. Building this other wall type. I've been doing a lot of building and crafting and scavenging. with the base building I was trying to find a nice enough spot that was far away from where most would build so I'd join and my base would be there way more often than not. I dont like jumping servers constantly looking at load scenes. I like to play the game. And helping out low levels was me trying to show that the community wasn't all bad in game. Theres alot of people who get enjoyment out of just messing with people. I try to help. And work with. The game is much more enjoyable to me when working together even if it's just to run around aimlessly. I hope this helps some. And that my information can bring a timely conclusion to this ordeal.¬†

üëΩThe next day I got a message saying the same thing as yours. I'm just Like. Alright then. Can't do much elseüëΩ

Stupid, no...

We do seem to have differing expectations of the word massively, however.  In all the time I played Fallout 76 (from release through early January), I never saw a server with more than twenty people online at a time.  More often than not though, the population of servers I'd play on would fall somewhere south of ten.  If you truly consider that design to be a *massively* multiplayer online game, I guess you do have the right to be wrong.
---
Should you prove more curious than you initially seem, however:
---
"A massively multiplayer online game (MMOG, or more commonly, MMO) is an online game with large numbers of players, typically from hundreds to thousands, on the same server." [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game ]
---
If you'd prefer more of a 'TLDR' style reference, consider Todd Howard's words on the matter:
---
"‚ÄúThis is not an MMO and this is not a battle royale,‚Äù [ https://variety.com/2018/gaming/features/fallout-76-online-interview-1202844504/ ]
---
Read his previous posts before you start projecting how he should dictate his sick leave 
---
I had to uninstall because I kept going back and I always felt disappointed.
---
That's what you get for playing 76
---
"I din due muffin!" &lt;--- that is literally you, and no one believes you. 
---
Yeah, since it's Bethesda launcher Verifying didn't come to me as a first idea, thanks for the suggestion, trying it now.
---
It's been nerfed. I just solo'd it 5 days in a row max level 40 mobs. It's now a waste of time for me at level 100 +
---
Joseph Anderson touched on this in [his (very good) review of the game](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/amfpkm/joseph_anderson_vs_fallout_76/).  The explore-quest/combat-loot cycle that is so much fun in Bethesda games is broken in FO76 due to the weight/item limits.  There's a core of a good game here, but the technical issues are keeping that cycle from being realized and until it is, it's really hard for Fallout fans to enjoy the game. The fact that some people -are- enjoying the game is a testament to the franchise and human willingness to squeeze fun out of something that is actually not that much fun (inventory management),
---
Man and to think i nearly bought it after beta. Not this time beth .. not this time. Fallout 4 vr ripoff was the last one you do to me.
---
I know, its fun watching the enemies fight.
---
Because people are defending cheating like it's their God-given right. "you allowed us to do it in all your previous games" and just the general ignorance towards policy is rampant in not just the 76 community, but every online community. It just feels that for FO76, it's more widespread because BGS fans have been so sheltered as to not know how multi-player games should work.
---
There have been quite a few posts about how we should be allowed to cheat just because it's possible, and that even removing dupe tricks would be "taking the last fun thing out of the game".
---
There may be a some unjust bans, but they have no way of proving that to us and seeing as they're all temp bans it could be much worse. 
---
Nope.  I'm pretty happy I refunded before release.
---
While I did hope this game would be decent - and I feel for you guys who are getting boned but still pretend he loves you - I'm actually getting $60 of entertainment from all the missteps this developer is making.  
---
Never have I seen such a mass of screwups from a single studio in such a short time.
---
What?!? Your information was great! 
---
I used it last night with a group of friends. We had a blast running in West Tech. So much goo!

So thank you from a level 60.

I believe you bud

This sub is the dumpster fire...

I see what you did there...

So i killed a guy at a workshop about a week ago.  Gorge junkyard to be exact.  I took over the workshop and then realized he was inside the building behind the workbench just squatted in the corner.  I killed him.  Thought he was afk because he never moved.  He dropped what looked like a bag of junk so i grabbed it.  Never scrolled through before picking it up and he dropped about half a million pounds of junk.  Took almost 10 minutes to drop it all.  Should i expect a ban?
---
typewriters in dryers
---
ya, probably don't even have the low intelligence needed to know what "post modernism" is. I guess you are just stupid. 
---
What a mature human
---
Oh hey you admitted you looted duped items. That's a start.
---
Can confirm. I have seen it.
---
call an attorney. put your money where your mouth is. I am sure you will win. 
---
If it helps I also got this the other day, figured I‚Äôd missed an update note. Just like OP I start pressing enter as soon as the game loads so perhaps it‚Äôs a trick to get behind the veil! 
---
I've just looked, and it's with the metal signs, and it's a tiny sign like "employees only". It's still locked, so I think I have to buy metal sign plan on top of it.
---
Feel so fucking ripped off. 
---
Look I don‚Äôt know what your issue is and your trolling but don‚Äôt worry reported you and will block you. I hope you grow up and have a life.
---
why? the first thing guilty people do is cry about their "innocence." This story is as old as man. 
---
That's Fallout. 
---
They don't have to be a liar.
---
But its not BethesdaAustin's duty to prove to you why they got a legit ban.  And its not like them providing the info to the bannee would make a difference - if they're lying now, they'd still lie and say that its not true.
---
And then you run by the pavilion near the clubhouse and drink from the sulphur water fountain and get cured and healed at the same time.
---
Bethesda has proven to be incompetent enough in their implementation of just about everything to where at the least you have to give him (and other people who are claiming false bans) the benefit of the doubt. 
---
ya, I think they should all be perma banned. 
---
Lol not for me. I trade half the time. Get stuff for people and so on. I keep it fun 
---
I feel like Bethesda isn't going to take the time to review dozens/hundreds of hours of gameplay footage to verify the quantities of items were legitimately acquired 
---
I really don't get why you have to post this on every thread you don't agree with. You are guilty. Deal with it. 
---
Sorry to hear that, I hope it's a mistake. I was just using your route and commenting about it with a friend, your post is gold. Good luck man.

I don't ps4 has a streaming cloud service for music other than Spotify, but there is the basic "Music" app that lets you play any mp3 file off a connected usb device. So you can go through the effort of downloading and making your own playlist.
---
yeah, it's annoying and a waste of time if it is not possible to receive max level weapons.
---
Instigating weapons are _the besssst_, I've got a Gauss rifle, war drum and black powder rifle. The Gauss rifle is gonna be my wife for the whole game 
---
nice appeal to emotion, except no one cares but you. 
---
If you're on PC, it's [definitely an option](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124), just not official. You're not the only one who gets annoyed at swapping out sets ;)
---
I think the system has some sort of  system that count every item you pick without considering if you hold the items or not. In fact people is banned for have 100.000 items in 30 days. I don't think they check inventories but this system that count item picked/crafted
---
I feel like both of those games you mentioned are completely different games than what Fo76 is or is trying to be 
---
I don't know what their roles at BGS are, but here are the only Bethesda employees I've ever seen comment on here:
---
u/BethesdaGameStudios_, u/Ladydevann, u/FurySevenSix, u/Valseek, u/jessBethesda
---
Hope this gets you some visibility and they can escalate your issue. GL
---
let me guess..... you "din due muffin!" 
---
HAHAHAHA
---
That‚Äôs what you get for owning a mule account.
---
So happy that carry limit abusers like yourself now have no place in this game, good riddance.
---
*the game has some sort of system 
---
This reminds me of runescape ban investigations. Having 100,000 of a rare item is impossible without duplication. The chances of appeal look bleak
---
Almost all? Alright. 
---
Yes for many reasons. The largest being Bethesda has no reason to lie. How ever players have every reason to lie in the world. 
---
liar
---
Yes. Or are just going beyond the usual hate posting.
---
#What a motherfracking joke of a studio.
---
Next time you do a run of buying booze and cola, count how many you actually get and how long the run takes, then figure out how many runs it'd take you to get to 100,000 of any single item and if you could do it in 720 hours (or in 240 hours which is what playing for 8 hours every day for 30 days adds up to).
---
You still haven't explained why I would call a lawyer keyboard warrior.  And your literally the only one who brought up currency of any kind.
---
What about the accounts banned a month ago,  Will they eventually be allowed back? I've tried endlessly to speak with customer support and totally being ignored. 
---
I have access to my accounts and have no trouble playing. So yeah I "din due muffin" fam. 
---
100,000 is not the minimum, it‚Äôs just a blanket statement they are using. 
---
Uhh.. I guess help them solve the codes, so then at that point I know the codes?
---
Perhaps you should read his post, then read his other posts. And then think, if you played this game obsessively on workers comp.
---
I know what your issue is. You got banned and I don't believe your "din due muffin" story
---
I wasn't banned lmaooooooololololololol 
---
Wtf are you on about keyboard warrior?
---
I needed a couple stimpaks, but for the most part the mothman isn't super lethal. I can take some hits in the fully decked out T-45!
---
This is the official reply from Bethesda on the error code, couldn‚Äôt see how to copy the link so I‚Äôve copied the text instead: ‚ÄúHello,
---
We posted a response in this thread on the same topic. Essentially, accounts that are receiving this login message have been identified by our Customer Support team as having acquired over 100,000 of one or more rare items in-game through duplication. These accounts have been suspended until this issue is fixed in a future patch, and those players will be notified once their Fallout 76 access has been restored.
---
Thank you. 
---
People are saying the email has only reached them days after the ban so your email is either still on its way to you or it‚Äôs in your spam folder.
---
Stimgwing? I thought I had missed out on mutant stingrays there for a second
---
I'll probably see a deathclaw eventually, but weird that I haven't already given that I've been there a hundred times
---
that awkward moment when a duper implies someone else is immature 
---
Why can't it be that we don't believe either party? 
---
haha it made sense with lunch aswell.. its 3pm for me eating lunch rn while its verifying XD
---
Hope you return once everything is settled.
---
I duped and didn‚Äôt get banned. I really think they must‚Äôve been going after people with metric fucktons of stuff.
---
Bethesda ~is~ detailing what made their specific accounts ban-worthy. Read the email links banned people are posting; they specifically state that the person in question acquired 100k+ rare items within a 30 day period of time. 
---
As far as Bethesda's proof, no, they don't have to share the evidence they have. Sadly that's not how it works. As I pointed out to someone else recently, this isn't public justice, this is a private service. They don't need to disclose their proof to anyone, and we all agreed to their policies when we logged into the game the first time (and possibly when creating an account).
---
So basically, even if you don't like the idea of it, the players ~do~ need to provide some kind of evidence to back up their claim of innocence, and Bethesda (or any other private service provider in a similar situation) does not have to. This is a fact, not an opinion. 
---
If you don't like that I don't blame you... but your choices in response are to either stop playing video games, or try your hardest to convince the entire industry to change, which isn't likely to happen. &gt;_&lt;
---
Bethesda: Our records show that you duped/exploited and have over 100,000 of a rare item. Something that wouldn't be possible to get
---
yeah a stingwing lol
---
I'm not saying that Bethesda is lying, but that they could have implemented yet another faulty system of code. These players will all get their accounts back when the patch releases, so I do not see what reason they have to lie.
---
I quit playing this game at patch 5. I dont care what you think is skeptical at all. You said it wasnt possible. But you're wrong. If you run with multiple people you get well over 10,000. I dont understand why you want to know what I'm doing with that steel or why I'd want it? It's called ammo crafting. Furthermore, who if you want to be a sheep, I get it. But you're name is Chally the cow, and I cant help you be "motivated" to do anything. Lazy gamers are lazy. Adios.
---
Riot if there isn't an "[Update] My account has been unbanned" post in the next week
---
Considering how imcompetent Bethesda has been with everything involving this game, is it really that hard to imagine them fucking this up? 
---
The solved code is always at this link [https://nukacrypt.com/solved](https://nukacrypt.com/solved)
---
As for helping solving, there is already a small group dedicated to that every week.
---
Oh so YOUR the decider of reality lol who would've thought it was some fat guy who hasn't had a social interaction outside the internet in years.  Go figure right?
---
There is only one flaw to your logic.. Guys that trade and get decent guns,armor, apparel got hit too. Caps are a rare item and if you have sold over 100k worth you got banned.  Its easy to get 20k for one gun or rare outfit and anyone can get the outfits if you spend time on it.  
---
Yeah they're just too weak and fragile to be useful. I've got a Berserker's Gatling Plasma that can shred a Sentry Bot in about 5 seconds, but it breaks after one core. What.
---
Hey, much appreciated
---
Appeal to emotion? Obviously I am the only one who cares as I move through countless threads claiming false bans. And you replied. I suppose that means you dont care either but you were bored and not clearly emotionally invested into caring. 
---
Asking people to consider possibilities doesnt equate to any singular belief. If you have an issue with considering all facts you are the problem. 
---
I‚Äôm playing almost every night with a group. What platform?
---
I don‚Äôt know. From other reports, I‚Äôd say yes. In only that others to have claimed something similar have been. 
---
His post history if FAR more reputable than yours, and has even had commendations from Bethesda employees
---
deathclaws are such a fallout staple..its so fun fighting them
---
[The glorious sloth](https://imgur.com/4w4FX8r)
---
First of all "bro", there are actually people who have been wrongly banned. Second of all, I didnt just use the found loot for myself,  but was making and repairing materials for new players. Lastly, i think its kinda petty that you have to just attack me because you have nothing better to do than try to start an argument because you are all high and mighty since you were not unjustly banned. 
---
I agree with some of your comment, but buying a gun off reddit when bethesda told us to trade amongst ourselves should not be bannable.  Thats just silly
---
You have a bunch of fallout merch but didnt get 76?
---
Aye, I've seen that last one too. Maybe a bug. 
---
Overall the bulldoze feature was a nice addition, but not implemented in a great way. I can understand putting limits on rocks, since they can serve as the foundation of other terrain, but I would really like them to extend the bulldoze to all trees. Those things can be terrible view blockers, and some of them are just plain ugly haha.
---
Yeah I agree. Like I said I wasn't claiming he lied or anything. I dont know how well Bethesda handles reports and tickets, might be the agent is incompetent. But usually companies are careful with permabanns since it costs them customers. I hope however the best for OP.
---
We should be able to throw those things at enemies for triple damage one time only and then the crappy weapon disappears 
---
Well all the people who picked up dupers bag or were vigilantes or whatever will be flagged too, that‚Äôs karma I guess lol.
---
Get Twisted Muscles mutation for an extra 25% damage.  As others have said you can also go for a low health build but it's not for everyone. The adrenaline perk works well for tanky mobs and be sure to repair your weapons to 200% for a flat 60 damage increase. That should buff your damage by 80-200 depending on the circumstance without sacrificing any health
---
So your saying cheating in a game is a direct correlation to maturity? Smart.
---
The catch is every update says they fixed a duping method.  There will always be dupes.  This still sucks.  It better be with patch 6 that the ban goes away.  Its not really fair with everyone that really has duped not having anything happen.  I would not be upset if all the people with multiple identical TSEs and other weapons and armor were not just knocked down to only 1 item.  Those folks never got banned.  Bethesda's actions are simply not consistent.
---
Good luck to you..... but I'm not optimistic. 
---
Can‚Äôt recall the name of the location there are two power armor stations in the same area. Its south of that big mining structure. And another a little east of that location. Its at a red rocket.
---
I hope not.  I love the game and series.
---
Yeah, I've had that pop up for a couple weeks. Since Patch 4, I want to say. Doesn't come up OFTEN, but it floats around. Have to back up to move back to the main menu, then can play normal.   
---
Surprised I'm not the only one!
---
Corporate espionage is paying trolls to come smear on an objectively broken game that has already failed commercially?
---
Guess I learn new things everyday.
---
Stop, just stop.
---
Bethesda, as usual, fucked up and banned a couple of innocent guys during their latest banning round. There are enough verifiable and objective examples that this game has been mismanaged every step of the way during its post-production phase and this is just another instance of it.
---
Not true.   I was suspended.  My character hasn't been over 285 pounds in over 3 months.  Other than when I scrap some guns. Even then I'm like 100 pounds over weight.   And I have never duplicated anything.   I've never had thousands of items.   
---
It's a shame that they have said there will be a roadmap shortly, a new game mode is coming and new pve content is coming and the regular patch cycle is still going on.
---
So ignoring reality your theory checks out.
---
If they kill the game i want a refund
---
Why are other player's word without proof more valid then Bethesda? Cheaters that are caught have every reason to lie. But Bethesda has absolutely 0 incentive to lie or purposefully mess things up. 
---
Oh.. that's what you meant.. All I wanna kinda know is what the hell key letters means
---
Damn son get off my dick dont be that pathetic and follow me around lmaooooo
---
And again I never got banned but you obviously dont have the intellect to read do you?
---
Caps aren't items
---
Months ago I just stopped playing, I wanted to go back but I keep seeing all these issues. I've seen some positive things here over the past few days so I thought about going back but after seeing this I think I'm not gonna go back for a while
---
Just logged on.  Everything is fine and dandy.
---
I remember the learning curve largely being just "get a hotas".  My brief time on kbd/mouse was not fun, especially docking, and I couldn't even bother with combat... but then I invested in a mid-range hotas (thrustmaster t16000) and within a few weeks of practice with it I was flying circles around npc bandits and having a lot of fun.  ;)
---
Can you show? I dont remember it.
---
When I was leveling in Camden somebody came running towards me followed by a huge heard of ghouls. He died as he got to me so I stimpacked him and we fought off the ghouls together. Afterwards he dropped a nice .45 automatic he found for my troubles.
---
No screen shot of the e-mails. Sounds  suspicious. 
---
He forced me to stay inside the room. Went into edit mode and deleted the doors- forcing me to be in an unwanted position. It really doesn't matter if you think its griefing or not though because facts don't care about feelings or opinions.
---
Traps exist to deal with enemy AI. Deleting doors through edit mode hardly counts as "game mechanics" lol.
---
Train stations mostly. 
---
Who said anything about PvP? 
---
I don't dupe or glitch. Probably have a duped item considering I have TSE weps I traded for, but not knowingly sought after or taken dups. How about pulling your head out of your self-righteous ass and consider for a moment BGS has royally fucked up.
---
This is what could save the game. I'll play again if I get a saved server.
---
Maybe you're short on a material?
---
If you quit the game then why are you here arguing with people and calling them sheep? 
---
Go have fun with your life. :)
---
Ok there Gargamel. Besides, Level 2 isn‚Äôt a smurf, it‚Äôs a mule. You can‚Äôt even PvP at such a low level, and doing much of anything will cause you to level, which isn‚Äôt the point of such a character.
---
Yep, definitely guilty of that. I'll happily admit it. 
---
Solar powered perk gives u plus 3 STR at 3 stars. And radicool can increase up to 5 STR when radiated.
---
Gosh I hope not. This game is honestly so fun. I'd be really sad :( 
---
stop lying, bro. No one believes you
---
Nope it's locked in the menu next to the other licked metal signs.
---
I‚Äôm still in here! Lol. 
---
the guilty always claim innocence, but only the stupid believe them. 
---
I'm really paranoid about trading for this reason. I'm a hoarder with problems, but if you didn't know that you might mistake me for a duper.
---
Amongst my most prized junk, I count (rounded down):
---
- 50,000 5.56mm (I've probably crafted and fired an additional 30,000)
---
- 1000 Psychobuff (Glorious)
---
- 250 Bufftats (When I run out of Psycho I craft this)
---
- 550 Nuka-Grenades (I craft them but rarely use them) 
---
- 90 Nuka-Quantum Grenades (I've never once use one, too precious...)
---
- 200 Whiskey (Psychobuff + Whiskey + Party Boy/ Girl was mandatory for me to sprint for a time)
---
- 220 Grape Mentats (Mutfruit is abundant SW of Morgantown, other component is Whiskey)
---
- 100 units of every other alcohol (excluding the moonshines, I'm working my way there but they're rarer)
---
You should know that this is my light loadout. I was carrying 200 of every other grenade (excluding pulse, rare...), 200 of each alcohol, 300+ stims. It's taken me days of inventory management over my 400 hours. Whilst legendaries are not guaranteed and I've not had the best luck, I certainly have achieved something in my time; I have an immeasurable pile of junk, and I love it! 
---
There is cheating and also "being associated with cheating". People don't seem to be able to tell the difference.
---
Bethesda did, and they banned you #LisforLOSS
---
bro Bethesda isn't going to review your gameplay, the suspensions are not reviewable, at all.
---
Did you logout in PA before? Do you have certain perk cards? Rad worms? Moving your camps?
---
You are not as clean as you think. 
---
100,000 is nothing you can get that in ammo and kick easily if you know where and how to farm. Crafting things with Super Duper. I think some innocent people like my brother got suspended with people who deserved it.
---
I'll say the same thing I said on another thread: I'm not trusting either.
---
Bethesda has made some mistakes
---
Some players are cheaters
---
As far as Venn diagrams go, it's just an X in the center.  Best bet in this case is to not believe either side at the time being.  
---
Oh for sure, HOTAS is game changing for Elite. I have one myself for my PS4 and it makes the game a joy to play.
---
oh hey look an hour later...and no proof :P 
---
Players who have been temporarily suspended for interacting with an undisclosed amount of undetermined items during an alleged month may get their access restored to their *accounts* when a future patch with no explicit time frame that addresses an exploit that has not been described is released.
---
You could be more vague than that but it would take some effort. 
---
I haven't played since the month it released because of how Bethesda has acted.
---
Just saw some on a chassis by the ammo dump. I was watching my husband play, so I didn‚Äôt make not of the actual location, but it‚Äôs in a house basement.
---
Me, my wife, and a coworker just picked up Destiny 2 and the expansions.
---
We're all having a blast in PvE. It's not nearly as buildy/survival as Fo76 but it also has like 1/1000th the amount of bugs. Everything just feels good/fun to do.
---
You sound like someone trying to be an asshole. To be frank with you. 
---
But you couldn't do that in previous Fallout titles. The original fan base liked the game when it was as you call it 'dull'. 
---
Thanks! That seems to be what most of the replies are leaning towards. I may have been thinking of that thing where they disabled 2 of the 3 Enclave vendor terminals... don‚Äôt know much of the details but it sounds similar.
---
Yes.
---
That'll do troll, that'll do.
---
We would just flag those cases as spam and move on with our lives.
---
They got it right when they deleted duped items last week... Just sayin...
---
When it recently happened with anet and gw2 the guy had to pull a gdpr request on all the data they had on him. Even with redacted data he was able to determine the mass bannings were mistakes made by anet and they had to go on a retract their bans.
---
It took 9 months
---
I've played the game 450 hours and am a level 265.  You don't have to cheat to level up in this game.  Especially when you could grab 5 levels at the One Violent Night event in Beta at a time when the event would pop up every twenty minutes.  There were a lot of other places to power level early on if you knew where to look.  That isn't cheating.  
---
The only real person in this thread ^^^
---
The Bethesda apologists who infest this sub are not exactly known for their critical thinking.
---
Cool I‚Äôll try that thanks man
---
Moo. Quit trying to tell people how to live their life. Gotta be a white guy behind the keyboard. Quit oppressing me with your white guy lazy cow wannabe sheep ideologies. Moo.
---
I'd normally agree with you, but at this point trusting Bethesda is the same as getting married without a prenup
---
Usually the people duping weapons and armor didn't just limit themselves to that. They'd also dupe tons of stimpacks and nuka-colas, or accept large amounts of them in trade. I'm sure many of the dupers who got knocked down to 1 each of any item they had duped also got hit with this ban. 
---
To be honest, i doubt many people care what you believe, and you would be pissed if it happened to you so you can take you opinion and shove it up your fissure site.
---
https://imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl
---
check this to make sure you bought what you think you bought
---
What's senior, 20+ years?
---
Your account was clean because they wiped all the items in the last hotfix. Durr.
---
Just accept it, you got banned for taking part in exploits. However salty you feel, ya brought it on yourself. Your just mad you got caught.
---
I already help you to tag one of them in one of your post. 
---
There is nothing forbidding mule accounts currently. If Bethesda is going to start banning people for using mules, then they need to put out a hardstance of "mules = ban".
---
If he was truely banned due to a mule, it's yet another example of incompetence on Bethesda's part. 
---
I question if I'll get banned. I never dupped intentionally* and never associate with duppers or other players really. But I do have a problem farming. On some nights I can easily farm a bunch of legendaries. Sometimes I walk out with 50+ items. If i kill to many at once I notice i get the same item. I also hoard stuff just to give away when people need it or for caps to venders.
---
*I say intentionally cause there are times, recently even, I've logged in to double or triple of something on me in my stash or camp. No idea how or why.
---
Huh ok. Never seen that before I will check it out
---
Makes you wonder if this game'd have been a better product as a single player game.
---
**Bethesda:** Our records show that you obtained over 100,000 of a rare item in the last 30 days, we're banning you.
---
**OP:** I'm innocent I swear! This is because of trolls reporting me for trading! I never had 100,000 of an item! Never!!
---
**------**
---
Yeah, you'll have to forgive me if I don't buy what you're selling. Bethesda has made many mistakes with Fallout 76, but when it comes to bans they rarely miss the mark. People on this subreddit and others have made wild claims about why they were banned, including that they were banned for using mods, which is not actually a bannable offense.
---
If you were banned because people reported you, you'd have gotten a very different reason for your ban in the email they sent you. This is a very specific reason, not a general catch-all.
---
Next thing you'll be telling me is that Bethesda is conspiring against you and this is all a setup.
---
I find it easier to just have plain walls on the lower floor for now. If I lock things it gives griefers more reason to break things.
---
He literally said it's a mule, as in, it's purpose is just hold stuff not use it.
---
Also, as weapons/armor are leveled in this game, it really doesn't matter, as most of the good stuff he'd get wouldn't be usable to a lvl 2 mule.
---
Hope you like it. They ruined it for me when they switched to a new UI that was dogshit at handling but stylish looking. I tried it and hated how much slower I navigated around menus, which I did a ton of. Was full of annoying pitfalls, for example constant accidental unequipping entire modification builds and having to rebuild them mod by mod. Plus their attitude towards detractors was basically ‚Äúwe spent too much time coding this, so suck it.‚Äù That attitude was really the worst part of it. 
---
Too bad, cause otherwise it‚Äôs a fine game. But I refuse to stick with one that knowingly makes dev decisions that are bad for players and tells us to stuff it when we protest. Sound familiar? Lol.
---
Not any mistake, a mistake like this.
---
Upvoted because username checks out 
---
You can't post pictures on here which most ppl don't seem to realize
---
Its quite logic that a guy who got banned now has time to make 100 fake accounts just to complain and pray they forgive him.
---
Source? I remember the exact opposite being true - that this claim was full of shit and never substantiated. 
---
RARE items. Ammo isn't rare.
---
R&amp;G construction plant near Charlie silo entrance outside the building on the south east side there's a couple pallets that have 5-8 bags
---
Ugh... me too.
---
Thanks for the solution
---
Lol that's a different argument completely. I love f4 and fnv in they're own way but I'm not gunna ignore other people in the world either. I'm saying not using trading as an advantage is dull. 
---
the venders sell about ~10 each between and considering their stock changes every single time the game crashed and kicked us?
---
TBH it could even be the Camp duplication glitch since it took me like 2 hours to get rid of all that stuff Bethesda forced on me, it's hard to tell without knowing what a "rare item" is. heck i'm sure we've all killed dupers and trashed their stuff too that could be part of it.
---
It's really no skin off my nose since I haven't played in a while, they should be wooing me back with content not the first time i've thought about the game in weeks is hearing a 900hour played guy got banned.
---
Didn‚Äôt say I was posting proof today did I?
---
And trust and believe I have proof.
---
I will even tell you what the proof is and the date on the proof.
---
It‚Äôs a list of know issue with the game and duplication is listed on it. The date is November 2nd 2018.
---
You don't need multiple copies of the game to move items between characters... Just need a friend.
---
I'm not crying. I'm not even really upset. I'm just more aggravated at Bethesda for not being transparent AGAIN and leading us to believe we were ok in the first place. I could have stopped playing a month ago and saved myself a lot of time if they had said more bans were coming.
---
Been playing Anthem, its pretty good, not as good as 76. Its funny because I figured Anthem would be bug free but it crashes a ton, audio cuts out and has infinite load screens. Its just as bad as 76. I think Bethesda is doing what they have to and is probably banking on people coming back for the next update. 
---
to be honest, all you duper cry babies are on here lying because you do care what others believe. If I was cheating and got caught, I wouldn't be lying on internet forums for someone to believe me. That is pathetic. 
---
Happy cake day !
---
I haven't played since beta, you have my support op.
---
I keep hearing this! BioWare and EA stickers on it give me so many misgivings about it though. I‚Äôm not gonna pre order but keep my eyes close on it and see how it turns out. Maybe a couple months after release, if it is still good, I‚Äôll play it.
---
Haha duper tears are so sweet
---
That's a very long-winded way to say that you don't think people should be banned for exploiting a duping bug, despite knowing that it was against the game's rules. I get it, some of the friends you made in this game who were breaking the rules they agreed to have been punished for it. It sucks that you won't be able to play with them. It was also completely avoidable.
---
You don't need solid coding to discover the anomaly. Elasticsearch is free and easy to setup for anyone with a bit of experience. It's the industry standard by a long shot for stuff like this.
---
SUE THEM.. jesus fucking crist just sue bugthesda . 
---
You haven't hired a lawyer lately (or you've got *really* great rates where you live).  Where I'm from, it will cost you at least $300/hr to get laughed at, and that's for a low end chuckler.  
---
Dupers :)
---
Sorry about this OP I wish Bethesda were more competent, in my case I‚Äôm probably done with this game, have other games to play now anyway,.
---
Where are the metal signs on that table?
---
Rice patty‚Äôs.  
---
Well my brother was suspended. I know for a fact he never duped. He hasn‚Äôt played since Christmas. All that he had was a mule account with steel cement and Stimpacks on it. He kept a lot of still because he would move his camp a lot and he built his camp out of metal.
---
I am SO thankful I don't own a copy of fallout 76, This is getting extremely ridiculous.
---
Cool 
---
Not sure what post history has to do with OP's ban. You have to admit that atleast some players were legitimately banned, right? As in, Bethesda banned actual dupers. We can agree on that? Or are you of the opinion that they totally messed up the ban wave and all the dupers got away Scot-free? I mean someone got banned right (I mean OP did, so there has to be others). Yet they aren't speaking out, so let's just assume they're guilty. So the ban limits worked on some fundamental level. Now, I actually never have cheated in the game, and I haven't actually been banned. OP has actually been banned, along with all the other legitimate dupers that were banned legitimately, but somehow his is wrong. You see the disconnect here?
---
The 900 hours guy is definitely not a sock puppet account, and put in far too much effort helping the community with guides, farming, and getting commended by Bethesda employees to have been a duper all along.
---
Yet he was falsely banned. 
---
Sue them for what?  People like you shouldn't be allowed to post on reddit.
---
The supers and cheaters deserve to be banned. The people who purchased the game and did not cheat were harmed by the cheaters and dupers. 
---
The cheater, dupers caused unstable servers, wrecked the gameplay and trading economy. 
---
PvP is a non-starter because of the cheater dupers, unfair advantage to the cheater dupers and their trade partners who obtained OP weapons, armour, and mutations.
---
People are getting banned for using legitimate perk cards? That sounds little out there.
---
Fixing Bulldoze, alone, would be a huge QoL improvement for camp building. Making it so we can bulldoze any tree, and that things we bulldoze stay gone, would allow us to build in a ton more locations and make a bunch of interesting camps without changing anything else.
---
I mean, both of those are likely and both have been proven to have happened in the past. So at this point you may as well just flip a coin
---
I guess, in a way you did :P
---
I suppose you are aware that you are only removing pictures from the in-game gallery when you are 'deleting' them, right? On my PS4, all the photomode pictures I ever took are available from the system's photo storage.
---
I only keep the ones in the gallery that I like to keep as loading screens.
---
They said a roadmap would be out at the end of February at the beginning of the month lol, did you read the last inside the vault? It‚Äôs the exact opposite of everything you said in this post 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure me and my friends all got banned for being reported so many times since all we did was harass people all around. We would play as raiders and go kill people and take their stuff and none of us have ever owned 100,000 of duped stuff so I‚Äôm pretty sure Bethesda was lazy and just banned people who got reported a lot 
---
how people like you even support this "game" blows me away. this is your "just-desserts" as they say 
---
Wow that's bs.  I've never duplicated and I get fuckin banned.   What a crock of shit 
---
Certain perk cards are bugged to players advantage. So if you use them, you are exploiting and you should stop due to Bethesda logic. 
---
Is there a reason to buff power armor while normal armor sucks ass?
---
I highly doubt this guy is lying, considering how much work and effort hes put into helping the community, and getting commended by Bethesda employees no less 
---
Worth noting is that the bethesda launcher itself updated when I turned on computer today.  Then after updating is when I see fallout 76 isn't installed, fallout 1 and 2 had also uninstalled themselves, so maybe the uninstallation is an issue with the launcher itself, though it took place after an in game crash. 
---
Really...  I find it ironic he mentions the straw man fallacy whilst actively providing a grand wall of text that exemplifies it quite well. 
---
"This subreddit's subs dropped from 171k to 169k. Make of that what you will Bethesda. "
---
Don't let the door hit the dupers on the way out !
---
Bethesda is in a no win situation here.  Even if they did make a mistake they can't admit it.  Could you imagine what would happen if they looked into an account and found out the person was fine and let that go public?  If it turns out they caught up non-dupers in anything there best play would be to silently let the accounts reactivate on the next patch.
---
The handling of everything is just really odd.  There are is small group that is complaining about duped items, but every time they have done something a massive amount of the player base has left.  I only have 1 of the 30 or so people I used to play with still on the game.  We are a couple days removed from them actually fixing everything and deleting some of the duped items.  They fixed the problem form most players perspective and picked up a lot of good will.  Another mass ban just undermined the goodwill they just created, less than a week ago.
---
I have concluded that the staff manning the desks in the military wing of the enclave bunker are all chain smokers given the number of flip lighters, cigarettes and ashtrays lol
---
Like do you want a crew to mess around with? Or are you looking for actual goals?
---
I'm repeating myself now and will have to stop answering these replies in a minute, but they don't have to provide real time evidence they didn't do the action. They need to provide some kind of proof that they're innocent of the accusation, which can be done in a few different ways.
---
For one, they could claim they didn't get the goods by duping, whether through reasoning or material evidence. The people contesting the bans don't seem to be arguing they don't have such high numbers of goods, rather, they seem to be pointing out that they DID have the numbers, but didn't get them through duping. So pointing that out could be a good start.
---
Example, one dude claimed he was multi-boxing to farm. Another dude just explained to me how one could reasonably farm a crapton of steel in less than a month. 
---
Another means of defense would be to provide proof of 'community services'. The dude with the 1.6 upvotes says he has a history of helping people out here, so that can be used to demonstrate to Bethesda that he has nothing to gain from duping, and is intent on helping the game. It's not ironclad, but it helps.
---
The point is that there are ways to make a case for innocence beyond simply writing "Hey I'm innocent." That is not an argument, it's not proof, and it's not helpful!
---
They want free internet points 
---
&gt;Bethesda has no clue what they are doing.
---
And unfortunately this has been ringing true more and more over the past few years, and there's no indication they're turning things around. I'm so fucking glad I didn't buy this disaster, and unfortunately it looks like I won't even consider buying ES6, even though the previous ES games were some of my all-time favorites.
---
Screw 'em.
---
I know this - so why are people talking about buying multiple copies for mule accounts?
---
Damn... Happened to me too. I had a lvl 420 and I've never traded with anyone and I got the ban. Never duped a day in my life. Unbelievable.
---
The worst part is I bought the game again, but they banned that one too because it was on the same Xbox
---
And how do you know it is a faulty code other then players claiming to be innocent? Generally in server based games they track the activity of each account. They can at any time access an account's inventory and look at what they have and look at what they have gained in game.  Equally they create back ups of each account on a second server in case of data loss on primary server.  They can also search the back ups so even if you were to remove all your ill gotten gains the back up data would still show your inventory full of the ill gotten loot.
---
It would be a simple program to find accounts with abnormally high level of items then for a human to slowly go though and double check.  Because as Bethesda said only around 1% of accounts were found to be in violation. 
---
Read this and see if you still agree with your comment
---
Ditto, I‚Äôm just waiting until the fix everything/when they add private servers.
---
Occam's, not occum's.  
---
And you'd be surprised how many cheats bleat about their innocence.    
---
You ever watch a parole hearing online or on tv?  No one ever committed the crime, they all plead innocence, but still say, "I have learned ...."  
---
All of them guilty?  Well , we know Beth makes errors.  But most of them, or the vast majority?  I'd guess, yes.
---
He's full of shit
---
Good stuff, thanks so much!
---
Im not lying on internet forums, im trying to get something done about it. Hell, i wouldn't even care if they wiped my inventory of the items i picked up, i just want to be able to play the game i bought for full price as a preorder. Its sad. Im not trying to pick a fight, i just want to be able to play. I really enjoy the game. Plus, its not like i had legendary weapons that i was selling and going around slaughtering people, it was junk items. Im only a level 68. I was just over joyed to find a bag with items that i could repair my PA with. 
---
What dont you understand when I say I never got banned lmaooolololol
---
&gt; People don't need to be paid to troll. They do it plenty on their own.
---
100% this. Once information came out about all the claims that were complete bullshit on here, I had to take a while to think about it all. So many people with so many stories and it was all completely fake. I found it unbelievable that so many people would lie without there being some massive conspiracy around it. I remember back in the early days of the game when everybody was talking about how r/fallout is nonstop shitting on this game, some people swore that r/fallout had an organized group doing what they could to break this game. I don't know what to believe anymore, but it upsets me knowing that if people are truly getting falsely banned, it's almost certainly going to get lost in the sea of liars
---
You may have fallen into the grey area where you legitimately accumulated 100,000 of something that the devs considered rare in the past month due to the crazy amount of hours playing or finding a loophole to get something rare a lot. At the end of the day it is a game. Even if you are stuck to a bed there is a lot of other games or other things to do until they address the issue or even if they don't reverse it. And if you really just want to play Fo76 then it is fairly cheap to get another copy to use on a new console/pc account, it's half price.
---
There's a cliff southeast of westek with 25 iron nodes on it. In an excavator suit that's around 300 ore, or 1k steel's worth after smelting with perks. Takes all of 10 mins to collect. Then acid farm for 20 mins doing server hops to make the 150 you need to smelt. ~30 mins for 1k steel.
---
Source: I go through about 30k 5mm a day.
---
Ive been refreshing my email like crazy, reading posts it seems like everyone over lvl 100 is getting banned today. 
---
Wouldn't say go fuck himself but I'll wait for more evidence before getting my pitchfork. Remember when GG.bet had banned someone who was blatantly cheating on /r/dota2 and going against their terms of use, yet the cheater was able to lie well enough on reddit that everyone rallied behind him and caused a mass shitstorm towards GG.bet.
---
After seeing enough people pick up pitchforks and rallying behind a liar, it doesn't hurt to not try and see all sides to a story.
---
Um, the red ring of death was an Xbox issue.
---
Ya bro here is where I chime in. Warframe is possibly one of the best games ever made. And I say this as an avid pvp guy even though it‚Äôs pve. 
---
I find it funny that my answer to the 900 hours guy was downvoted a lot, stating pretty much what you're doing here.
---
I do statistical data analysis for a living, this is really trivial stuff, suck it up guys!
---
Get a high level player and grind out events
---
but yes if you bought the "resort sign" that is the one that says whitespring not sure why it would be locked
---
You created a reddit account just to troll and bother people. Who's the real shitty person here?
---
I never said they lied or purposefully messed up.  I think they made a mistake again.  They'll fix it though but I believe this is an error on their part. 
---
The high level player to help you
---
GTFOH with that "shouldn't post on Reddit" bullshit"
---
By that assertion you shouldn't post here either....
---
There are at least 4 spawns in Watoga. 
---
1.	On the street near Phoenix, next to the vertibird 
---
2.	Roof of the civic center
---
3.	Roof of the EMS building
---
4.	In a locked room in the transit hub 
---
This run doesn‚Äôt take long to complete, and if you have Marsupial you can take a couple shortcuts. I‚Äôve also seen one inside the civic center but only once, so I don‚Äôt know what that was all about. But you can make server hop runs through the city, hitting each one of those, and you‚Äôll find it soon!
---
*Any* mistake.  Including one like this.  
---
&gt; They'll be storing the transactions everyone makes, where the item came from and when it was created etc.
---
Will they?  Can you prove this?  I suspect that they are not storing that much information.  
---
&gt; It's very, very easy to fill data like this into Elasticsearch and do an anomaly detection.
---
Or they could just sum up every time an item has been given/received/picked up, so dropping the same item and picking it up 50 times counts for +50 to your "bannable" limit.  Who knows?  I don't know what their backend system looks like and I suspect you don't either, but the reality is that I've seen some evidence that they're not storing as much fine-grained data as you seem to think they are, and I've seen some evidence that the way in which certain things are tracked is not as well engineered as you probably assume it is.  
---
A few bugs/incidents that I've personally experienced have given me *a little bit* (and really, I just mean *a little bit*, I'm certainly not claiming to be an expect here) of insight into certain aspects of the game's backend design, such as what happens when the instance server that your client is on crashes.  Even just the fact that you don't respawn in the exact same location when you re-login each time says something about how character locations are stored in whatever the persistent backend may be.  One thing that is clear to me is that there is a persistent backend independent of instances, and a transient backend which is actually responsible for quite a bit which is instanced.  
---
&gt;You have to admit that atleast some players were legitimately banned, right? 
---
Of course. I also completely beleive some innocent people were banned as well. It's far more likely to be true given Bethesdas track record here.
---
I guess you just wanna shut your brain off to that fact. Continue white knighting kiddo.
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/yed5Zfk](https://imgur.com/gallery/yed5Zfk)
---
That would explain all the bugs in the game
---
Wow I'd be so angry. I was really tempted to buy this game because of people like you sharing their experience and excitement on here but if this is how you're treated by them I'll very happily take my money and time else where. 
---
Hope you get your account back, this is ridiculous
---
Need more input.
---
That's what is is. I will take a screenie and put it up if I can. 
---
warframe is SO good. And Anthem is AMAZING for only costing $15 lol. You say you dont like PvP and anthem has NO pvp which is a GODSEND 
---
The shed outside of the burning mine where you do the Fire Breather test is where I found both T51 legs, one arm, and a helmet.
---
These conspiracy theorists crack me up, they ignore everything that‚Äôs out there and live in their own world of negativity praying for the game to fail, it‚Äôs sad 
---
Nobody‚Äôs screenshot of the items included 5mm or .50 cal though. T was always stuff you get in lower amounts, like shotgun shells and .45.
---
Reminds me of the WoW days when the first WoW Glider bot banwave hit 100k players.
---
Everyone was making up so much stuff to try and get their accounts back.
---
I should have invested stock in popcorn that month.
---
My attitude is simple: Don't post on the internet with claims of innocence and nothing else. If you find that 'disgusting' then I don't know what to say; you're either failing to comprehend the point or you have very different standards of proof than I do.
---
Each case requires scrutiny, and the person you linked has some variables in his defense. So hopefully he can get a proper 'hearing' from Bethesda. But that doesn't change the basic principle that 'because I said so' is not a form of evidence, nor does it make a compelling argument.
---
Now I must make dinner. Ciao.
---
Also, regarding the volume of posts on this sub, keep in mind that this reddit community is a small part of the playerbase. It's not crazy to believe reddit is home to higher-than-average number of people who have dupped. Also keep in mind their voices are amplified by everyone upvoting them, they're not even a majority of the subreddit, nowhere close.
---
I dont think so. Dude had contributed far more to the community than you have, for example,  and even gotten commendations from Bethesda employees. 
---
HACKER
---
I believe the OP. Just for the simple fact I was also suspended.  And I know I did none of what the email claims.  Never used an exploit , never even had my character overweight . Other than when I go kill supermutants and scrap their guns.   Meanwhile there are others that say  " I dupe all the time and haven't been banned " . Wtf is that about bethesda?  Dont ban the dupers ? 
---
I doubt you even know the definition of that word.
---
People.  It's doable for a long time, sure, but if they calculate your ACTUAL ONLINE TIME and calculate your production rate, it may be totally unfeasible.
---
My ban was for ammo and junk
---
I went back to ARK.  It's kinda refreshing, even on an empty server.  I'm sure i'll return to FO76, just not right now.
---
Uh they did tell you it was coming.  Its been known for like a week now.
---
Mutfruit, Tato‚Äôs and Corn.
---
Seriously though. There was a point in time (not that long ago) when disconnecting, crashing, going AFK for 10 minutes, and otherwise need long to exit to fix bugs inevitably leads to a server hop. I cleaned out the Top of the World countless times as a result, including the very generous 'Narco Bus' behind Resin's shop...
---
Alright so half way through reinstalling I'm getting this error message;
---
"Fallout 76 failed to download due to an error accessing a file. Please check directory permissions, disable any antivirus or backup software, and try again." (1.14.1.3.13.2437)
---
Sorry this happened to you.  
---
It's just Bethesda treating FO fans in its typical manner. 
---
Yeah it's been great lately. Had a full server this morning and yet everything was running beautifully. Someone nuked Whitesprings and most of the people in the server joined the fun, with no slow downs or disconnects to be had. 
---
Explain how you prove a negative, that you are not a duper.
---
Are you supposed to by a hard drive and record every second of playing fo76 as defensive evidence? Pretty dumb if you ask me.
---
Ok.
---
Trade with each other offline?  Where was this recommendation from Bethesda?
---
the game is a joke , I gave it a chance and now banned too . Lets see how they survive with all its players banned .
---
Ryanburns003 thanks you! 
---
the same good script and math made so bobbypins weighted tons? and reverted changes when they patched? yeah right lmao.
---
That's what I am worried about! Some people don't understand what hardcore players are capable of. Also you should test a Nuka-Quantum grenade. They are much less effective than you think they are. üòÇ
---
&gt; you'll just never run into an npc  
---
Rose.
---
I think you're on to something üòÇ
---
I love Apex, spent the last few days playing it non-stop, but I think Apex is a good case for how the gaming community is just negatively biased towards FO76.  
---
I've never experienced a single bug in FO76 (mind you I started playing in January), but my Apex Legends crashes constantly, disconnects me from matches and the sound bugs out if I have any other app open. Still, even being a buggy game (great, bug buggy), it gets /no shit/ whatsoever.  
---
Sure, it is free, but has a shop system that is even more consumer unfriendly than FO76. I got a lot of Atom points just by playing 76 a few hours and bought a lot of stuff from the atom store. On Apex you have to rely on lootboxes or pay up.
---
That doesn't make sense at all. 
---
Fuck if I know as I said "snowflakes" all of them.
---
I'm not going to say he *is* lying, but how does having a large amount of hours/levels prove innocence? It's entirely possible he is lying, it's also entirely possible he is a false positive. 
---
There are a few "easy" xp things I have found just from casually coming across them. Not farming them or anything really. But you get 50 xp for crafting a weapon and 50 xp for crafting an armor piece at the Overseers camp. I craft a board and level 1 piece of leather armor. 100 xp easy when I log in. Also doing workshops nets you a little xp for the clear the enemies, claim the workshop, and defend events. Though it'll cost some caps. You can be down caps doing that. But on the other hand you can also farm some caps stashes and sell stuff to vendors so you can make a little caps to cover the costs. Another thing you could do is farm low level events that award legendary items. If you get a good legendary weapon it would make grinding certain mobs a breeze.
---
I took duped items, but because a bunch of other morons were doing it, figured it was ok.
---
Is that across all platforms?
---
Call your CC or bank and do a chargeback for the game. Fuck Bethesda.
---
How? I think you're the one who sounds like an asshole. To be frank with you.
---
Right.  They finally actually somewhat fix the server issues. then ban players who may have picked up some items that were duplicated 
---
Unless you‚Äôre below 50 there‚Äôs no way 1 run of that event would ever net you 5 total levels, more like half a level at best. And yes of course there were many ways to power level, most of them were glitches, and the rest were changed or patched out early on, before someone could yield over 200 levels from these methods.
---
Not sure if serious or joking, but funny either way. 
---
And I'm not white, I'm a burgundy-brown. Moo. 
---
Yes they promised they would commit to a roadmap after they issue controversial bans and games in the same genre are released
---
Totally because it takes 3 months to put their plans into a readable format and NOT because they want to see how many people are still there before they commit to anything /s
---
There was a UI issue that let people sometimes accidentally list the wrong items. It might have looked like stealing to people who didn't know about it, but there was never an exploit that let a random person steal your stuff - you yourself would have to accidentally list it for sale through the bug, and the other player would have to buy it
---
YES!!  
---
If it grows, and I can pick it, I should be able to PLANT it.
---
Thanks for voicing this one.
---
So if I play my second character that's ok for them to have things in inventory. But if I dont play them that's wrong? I stay within their own stash limits as well. I literally just store some extra weapon types that I may want to play with if I change my build. Or some flux components because that shit is hard to make and takes forever. There are no rules saying you have to play every character you make 
---
Hookers and blow, my man.
---
Still pretty ludicrous that Bethesda had this opportunity to seriously upset their most dedicated player. Haha. I hope this isn‚Äôt their way of server balancing.
---
And why do you think Bethesda has messed up? Because of completely unrelated events? What would be the threshold for you to not think the Beth messed up?
---
it is accumulation over a 30 day period
---
You seem desperate to live in your own created reality, hope it goes well for you 
---
The options are 
---
All these banned people are lying
---
or
---
BethesdaAustin never made a mistake when banning an account for duping.
---
Since neither side has, IMO, sufficient credibility to be taken at their word, its he-said-she-said.
---
You have never purchased any weapons/gear or found something in a paper bag?
---
You know they banned these people right?
---
Ah, ok .....nice!....and ty üòä
---
God I wish they would just ban you guys who think it‚Äôs cute to troll the forum and hate on the game from this subreddit. You guys try to suck out enjoyment anyone has in it because you are mentally ill is the only conclusion I can come up with. 
---
Oh it fixed itself, I just had to set install location to the place it was already installed... must have just stopped being able to locate it for whatever reason.
---
I prefer Beefmasters or Herferds.
---
I feel like this is a case of ‚Äúplay stupid games, get stupid prizes.‚Äù In this case, the ‚Äòstupid game‚Äô is Fallout 76, and the ‚Äòstupid prize‚Äô is one of the most dedicated players of that fame being banned with little to no potential for recourse.
---
So.. Just confirming You and others like you who duped items sold fraudulent items on a game exploited and destabilized a gaming platform and ruined others peoples gaming experience by introducing instability and committed gross negligence and mischief want another chance to ruin improvements Bethesda has done?
---
You and others who duped have been blaming bethesda for a poor gaming experience and all the while complaining about crappy software. While continuing to commit the very thing making the environment unstable? OH HELL NO. 
---
You and others like you were the reasons why some of my closest friends quit playing. You and others who duped robbed them of a pleasant gaming experience, and disenfranchised and alienated a whole group of Fallout fans. If I wasn‚Äôt so dang stubborn I would‚Äôve quit with them. 
---
Let‚Äôs be honest, the  reasons you racked 900 hours of game play in a month was so you could line your pockets at Bethesda‚Äôs expense.  You duped items and sold them outright and blamed Bethesda for crappy software. For you This was a full time gig with all the trimmings and no taxes.
---
I‚Äôm not sure your assertion that you were banned for being an ingame jerk was relevant, since the screenshot you shared only mentioned your duping. But if you griefed, as well as duped it‚Äôs possible enough people agree to complain about your actions as well.
---
I think it‚Äôs freakin hilarious that you don‚Äôt think any one item up to 100k isn‚Äôt that much of an issue. But I am confident the incoming downvotes for my post will be your brethren also banned for duping. And I‚Äôm fine with that. As long as with each duper being banned continues to improve and enhance my overall gaming experience. 
---
Ironically enough  I‚Äôm sure that as the platform continues to improve And become stabile that more ingame DLC will finally arrive since they won‚Äôt have to constantly troubleshoot &amp; assemble tiger teams to determine where the resource leaks are. And it‚Äôs ok if it‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm just here to play, and in no rush to get TSE anything.
---
Just one fuck up after another from Bethesda. This game is honestly such a train wreck. Now they‚Äôre banning their most dedicated players?
---
Those be dangerous words round these parts friend
---
Some people are lonely. All I can assume. 
---
I joined a server and spawned right into a post-blast Whitesprings garden. Didn't quite make it do the lobby.
---
Not sure I see any proof he's not lying too.  I got him to admit he made his 'helpful' post after being banned, without mentioning at all that he couldn't log in. It's sort of fishy.  but I'm still reserving judgement.
---
You know they are releasing a roadmap at the r d if the month right?
---
I'm looking forward to Borderlands 3. If you haven't already try out Borderlands 1(if a friend can get it). I recommend Borderlands 2 as the best experience that can even be played pretty well on solo through the first time. 
---
Go on the CS:GO steam forums. Aside from the usual shitposts and trade posts in the wrong forum, you will find simultaneously a ton of "VAC doesn't work, valve lets cheaters run free!" and "I got banned for no reason fuck this game" posts at the same time. Do with that information what you will
---
I gotta say I loved how gta did it with the dunce servers
---
If you check out the guy‚Äôs account he is pretty active in describing his looting methods and documenting his play in general. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs lying.
---
Save Bethesda actually has a source of proof in the account logs of the players. Mean while reddit posts just have the claim they are innocent with no proof other then their word.  
---
lol he did that after getting banned.
---
Who said disabled people can‚Äôt cheat? Cheaters deserve to get banned no matter what walk of life they hail from. I agree he should be given due process and surely Bethesda has their proof. I‚Äôm just sitting back here and enjoying all of the complaints. TBH, I‚Äôve cheated in games before and have been rightly banned. I like fallout too much to cheat and wouldn‚Äôt risk it. Some people risk it and lose. 
---
this isn't a trial.
---
U on Xbox ?
---
Bethesda doesn't have to lie - they just have to be mistaken.
---
Its not deciding between two lyers.  Its deciding if one side is or is not full of liers and if the other side is or is not capable of making major mistakes.
---
And its not clear that BethesdaAustin deserves to be considered incapable of making major mistakes.
---
You‚Äôre right. You should try duping as well to prove how much smarter you are lolz
---
Because of logic he has a point, but the guy forgot its a game where no logic is ever used!
---
Repairing guns with vegetables is still fun tough, maybe we could beg for a corn shooter so we don‚Äôt cry for lead so much in the future
---
So you think the robot overlord is trying to hack their way through as well? 
---
They put people there for destroying other players vehicles.
---
Yeah :D and np
---
I mean there‚Äôs worse things anthem has done. And some of he bugs in 76 can be hilarious. Visual glitches are just visual glitches
---
Ps4 saves all photos in storage, even if you delete tgem from the games photo album they stay in storage until you delete those. I have almost 1GB of photos from F76 in storage now .... 
---
Perfect, I knew of the 1st 2 locations, I‚Äôll check out the others as well.  Thanks!
---
Who would spend this much time going on a subreddit or a game they hate just to try to upset the community? It has to be someone whose mentality Ill. 
---
Stop acting like they went out of their way to track down the player with the most play time and shit in their face.  
---
A script designed to comb through a player database looking for suspicious activity doesn't care about play time unless it's programmed to do so, and Bethesda wouldn't have thought to account for the possibility that a single player out there would be spending 40% of their life playing their game.
---
I could see some ban script writer put adhesive as a rare item. Forgetting or not even knowing that it can literally be farmed in the game(vegetal starch).

I really do wonder if anyone at Bethesda actually plays the game. I wonder who they‚Äôre going to hire to stream it.

Here are the pictures showing the sign is locked, and that at the whitesprings vendor the "Resort Sign" plan no longer shows up to be able to be purchased, nor in the "known section.
---
I have traded, but never sought out duped items or knowingly accepted duped items. Never found a paper bag full of duped items.
---
Great! I‚Äôll add that to my list of places to check.
---
Wait what i thought he didnt dupe? I have no idea how to dupe so I cant try it. I was just trying to stand up for this guy who i thought was innocent 
---
I don't know what to tell you, man.  I hit level 50 before the game was out of Beta just by rolling the events that awarded high XP over and over again.  Once I hit level 50, before the XP nerfs, it wasn't hard to farm places like Whitespring and level up very quickly.  You obviously didn't do that, and that's cool, but just because you didn't or couldn't do it yourself doesn't mean that it couldn't or wasn't done.
---
I've only gained a dozen or so levels in the last few weeks because I've cooled off on farming legendaries, but it still isn't hard to rack up half a dozen levels in an evening without doing anything unsavory.
---
Do you know if Xbox does the same?
---
&gt;Generally in server based games they track the activity of each account. 
---
Yes, in competent development companies.  Its become pretty clear that BA are building those tools still.
---
&gt;They can at any time access an account's inventory and look at what they have and look at what they have gained in game.
---
This is a company that told you that their CSR don't have that capability - even though, generally in server based games they would.
---
I‚Äôm missing a t-45 leg it‚Äôs been 150 levels and nothing 
---
I mean I dont play the game, and I've never said anything negative about it on any forum, but go ahead and keep proving that you're an asshole who's to busy stroking his ego just because you like the game. No one is required to like the game to post here, and no one requires your approval to have their own opinions. Go egobate in a mirror
---
For there to be 30 straight days of absolutely no performance issues or server issues or glitches or bugs
---
A work injury keeping him from doing anything other than play a videogame for 10+ hours each and every day *for over 3 straight months* is fishy.
---
That aside, I am not claiming anything other than people need to calm down and wait for more information before making any conclusions.
---
Thats good to know, but itd be nice to have a higher limit on customized loading screens.
---
As someone who's been out of work for an extent of time, I can say it's very easy to put 900 hours into a game over a 3 month period if you have nothing but time to play. Guilty as charged for Warframe.
---
hey bright side you don‚Äôt have to play this garbage game anymore 
---
According the bethesda they are! My friend got a reply from bethesda from his ticket and it listed caps at 107000 in the last 30 days.. He started with a small shop selling 1-2 star gear and worked up to better stuff. 
---
This is common in many games and doesn't break the license agreement. You're just salty af because you don't have a mule. 
---
People still play this shit? 
---
It‚Äôs a witch hunt, if you‚Äôre a witch. Lolz
---
Lol, I didn't know the mothman thing existed outside of the Fallout world untill this post...
---
It's threads like these that keep me from going back to this game. I seriously hope that a year from now I can go back and it isn't an utter mess but the polished game we deserves to begin with.
---
Oh, didn‚Äôt you read above? He openly admitted that he deserved it
---
It's been 25 years since the bombs fell. Any number of individuals and groups could have made camps in those places.
---
I just wish some of them had pushed a broom or a mop. There is no reason for all that debris on the floor.
---
Right. They said that some players had literally millions of items. 
---
And the fraudulent weapons, armor and mutations are still in the game.
---
Anyone who is not banned and possesses such items should play on segregated servers.
---
The playing field is not level and gameplay is wrecked for honest players.
---
PC
---
This is my 3rd post in this sub I think? No one is mentally I'll because they have a different opinion about a game than you holy shit. People post here because they want to talk with the community just because you dont like it doesn't mean they aren't allowed to post.
---
Ooh, let's speculate based on scant information, my favorite game!
---
It is very frustrating. Been hunting right leg for t51 &amp; t60 for quite a while now. I‚Äôm around lvl 115.
---
I won't argue with you. I made a mistake, I wasn't using that as an excuse. Shame on me for taking items and deleting them immediatley after. I should have just sat idly by and allow them to dupe and ruin the server I was currently playing on and the general economy as a whole.
---
Ultracite ammo is..
---
That's what I'm trying to point out. I dont know if people ste bullshitting about not duping not but I can guarantee I did.
---
If you really need something to spend free time on, just become a hauler in eve.  Find a good corp, lots of socializing, etc
---
What do you mean by fraudulent weapons armor and mutations? You mean duped items people bought?
---
It‚Äôs just another duper war. White knights attack suspected cheaters, Bethesda makes a few notable bans a small fix is made (of questionable quality), it fizzles out a week later, the playerbase takes a reduction, and everyone moves on. This is the cycle that‚Äôs been in place for about 3 months.
---
Let it pass. If you get banned, it‚Äôs apparently until they can stamp out duping
---
And you're not getting to see those server logs.  None of us are.
---
So all we have is an *assumption* that those logs exist (and this is a company where you can't assume they're competent enough to have this).
---
So what you have, in reality - is both sides saying the other isn't correct.  But you have no independent information useful to telling which side is.  All you have are the two side's reputations.  And BethesdaAustin's reputation is kind of shite right now.  
---
It's just Bethesda being Bethesda back to their weekly controversy
---
Pardon my ignorance, Is that the official Bethesda ruling? That authentication error is for duping?
---
Please advise.
---
I‚Äôve seen a lot of recent posts about it and thought it was something else.
---
I came from r/all. Also I am a huge FO fan generally so I come to this sub to see if the game ever ‚Äúgot good.‚Äù Cause I would love to play it if it ever got decent.
---
I also found it fun doing OP damage with TSE and bloodied explosive weapons to level 1 ghouls and scorched at my farm. I have a bunch of items, as most people have, that were no doubt duped. I don't think that is the reason though. They have made mistakes with this banwave thing apparently. Maybe you are just another collateral damage.
---
Popcorn tastes good
---
Mule accounts are common in games like this and definitely does not mean he was duplicating items. I use a mule to store a bunch of cool legendaries I found. 
---
Word of advice, having guides is super helpful and I always keep the wiki open on a second monitor when I play Warframe. 
---
Also, start Volt because it's been a bitch and a half to make with my small clan of friends. 
---
The only thing that will happen is they'll immediately respawn once a new set of players enters the area.
---
I bought the "Resort Sign" from the vendor at Studio 58 in Whitesprings. I read the plan and have enough materials to. Are it, but it won't unlock.
---
This cost me over 900 caps. I haven't unlocked the other metal signs, but why should I have to if I purchased an unlock for this sign? It doesn't have any special perk requirement s to use.
---
Here are the pictures showing the sign is locked, and that at the whitesprings vendor the "Resort Sign" plan no longer shows up to be able to be purchased, nor in the (known) section.
---
A quick search shows people on Xbox are doing screen shots of their photos from their album - that is saving the photos locally to the xbox.
---
I have no idea if it auto saves them like PS4 sorry.
---
Let's actually focus on issues such as duping still being a thing and fixing that first before this is even considered.
---
I'm holding out hope they manage to balance Demolitions sometime. I had also heard that they were already underwhelming... "demonstratably smaller explosive radius" comes to mind from a post I read a while ago. But those blue fireworks are something special, I used plenty in Fallout 4!
---
You don‚Äôt know if people didn‚Äôt get banned or have items removed.
---
You‚Äôre worrying way to much about something you‚Äôll never really know the facts about.
---
You‚Äôre just trying to get attention and stir the turd.
---
100,000 of a single item over 30 days requires getting 119 of them each hour, every hour, for 720 hours straight. If you only play 8 hours a day instead of 24, you need to get 417 of them each hour you play.
---
Anyone use AA rad rifle in pvp?
---
The only reason I ask is because I have found a bag with 15 thousand rounds of ammo in it. I also have purchased (unknowingly) duped weapons. 
---
I am only asking because I don't know what to expect when I get back on later tonight.
---
Then maybe specify what you mean.
---
My friend has about 750 hours and I‚Äôm at almost 800 and we were both banned. We never once ever used anything to exploit the game. We never even traded with anyone we suspected of duping to try to slow down the market! And we are both banned.... this is ridiculous honestly. Yeah I understand that some accounts will be mistakenly banned in a Huge wave like this but it‚Äôs been days now with no response. I want badly to support this game and have through thick and thin since the first beta. EVEN AFTER I HAD TO REDOWNLOAD IT! But I‚Äôm just so fed up with this... they are making it increasingly harder for me to want to defend the game 
---
True. On my melee character, I still pick up ammo to pass on to my team, and it stacks up super quick.
---
So what?
---
He freaked duped, and ruined everyone‚Äôs game play.
---
If you did the same, you‚Äôre just as scummy and hopefully be banned just as well.
---
That‚Äôs my problem.  Bought it, couldn‚Äôt get much done, left.  
---
And if that number is totaled across all 5 of my accounts with the difference characters, yes, I could possibly pass 100k.  And Bethesda does a poor job of outlining exactly what got us on the banned list.  It‚Äôs beyond frustrating. 
---
They didnt add player vendors and started a reddit for people to use to trade and communicate. Cant be any clearer. With that said, people who traded a few guns through reddit are not being banned, so Bethesda us ok with it, you should be too.
---
Never ever do continuous tickets unless you're a VIP customer. I and every other agent where i work abuse this SLA exploit so the angry spamming customers doesn't get a response until they stop. Absolutely nobody wants to deal with angry spammers and we'll use any excuse to avoid them. Convenient when we have to answer oldest tickets first, so nobody gets in trouble for not answering the spammer and it could be days until you get a reply. 
---
I don't really believe this. People on this subreddit are more likely to be meta gamers. Meta gamers are more likely to actually understand glitches within the game and how to exploit said glitches. So it wouldn't surprise me *if* most of these people were duping.
---
However 100k items seems like a lot to me, idk.
---
Did you guys just not use FO4 edit to open the plugin and read the script directly?
---
**Whoa a ""Duper""!!** What does a duper look like, your age? life story? what made you want to "Dupe" did you grow up in a duping household? How has duping changed your life? What other areas in your life are you cheating yourself? 9-10 dupers end up in the back of every line in life.. 
---
uggg thats tedious process, again though see if you can find anything you like on mixcloud, at least each mp3 will be at least an hr?
---
Yup, my son was given  ton of Nula-Cola by a stranger on Christmas Eve. Said "Merry Christmas" and took off. His account has been banned. I have no doubt that the items were duped. But being a teen, he was excited. He isn't worried, we know we filled out the email and know it will get sorted. I do understand what they are trying to do. So no, I'm not mad about it. He's not mad about it. An exploitation happened, and in order to stabilize the in-game economy and rebalance things/ stabilize servers, this has to happen. It doesn't mean you did anything wrong or are being punished. They are just trying to fix the issue. Please be patient.
---
Bump. And upvoting i quit playing wow because of all asshat ninjas. 
---
I haven't had a glitch in Apex other than my internet but the first month of 76 was unplayable.
---
I have heard that people have had problems with the Whitesprings plans working properly. I think, specifically, it was the Barn Walls plans that people would buy, but it wouldn't unlock.
---
I remember having that issue myself, so I just don't buy plans at Whitesprings any more.
---
The minimum is much lower than 100,000 and odds are it‚Äôs not as simple as a single number. More than likely, during the duplicated item (extra item) removal, they flagged accounts that required item removal for future investigation. Now they are going though and temp banning people who had suspect accounts until they have the coding or resources in place to manipulate those accounts to be what they consider acceptable. After which point they will unlock the accounts. As to when they will be unlocked and what those accounts will have left once they are done, is to be determined.
---
IF that is the case you should not be banned but only allowed to play on cheater/duper servers with others who obtained their OP weapons, armor and mutations....fraudulently.
---
The most likely scenario is that Bethesda succeeded in banning DuPeRs but also affected some innocent people in the process.
---
The guy whis spent many many hours helping the community with helpful guides to farm items, gotten commendations from Bethesda employees, and general willingness to be openly examined isn't the actions of a guilty party. 
---
I‚Äôd recommend Destiny 2
---
He freaking duped, and ruined everyone‚Äôs game play.
---
Sign me up BassByBlaine
---
Agreed. Have you lodged a claim with Bethesda to get your canvas bag?
---
Or No Man's Sky, so much to explore!!
---
Define wrecked? As 99% of the community I've run into are extremely helpful, polite, avoid pvp, and one of the best online group of gamers I've ever seen I fail to see how its wrecked. 
---
Ps4 will ban your account if you do that
---
We can try a euler diagram if you'd like.
---
So what? He freaking duped, and ruined everyone‚Äôs game play. If you did the same, you‚Äôre just as scummy and hopefully be banned just as well.
---
and just to check I know it's a dumb question but you did read it right? try leaving server and rejoining see if he has it for sale again and if it shows known
---
Yeah.... I log on once in a while thinking it‚Äôs be fun and then I get greeted by bugs etc. and just quit. One time I didn‚Äôt even get past the character select screen.
---
Your the one that made a blanket statement not me.
---
Tree and herb runs 
---
Is there a point hidden somewhere in your two lines of text?
---
All that fucking grinding...
---
Bah, what's the point in complaining. I'm getting sick of this game anyway. Building my camp was the only thing I enjoyed in the end, now that's left a bitter taste. Calling it a day on this game.
---
Lolz 
---
I suggest to show support for your banned buddy, you go on self imposed game strike till his account is restored 
---
I have not.
---
At first I procrastinated because I didn't care - then they allegedly had some data leak and I really didn't care after that lmao
---
Yes this is totally possible and probably a factor in some people‚Äôs accounts being ‚Äúflagged‚Äù
---
In all honesty the most difficult thing to pick up in that game is landing the damn ship. I think E:D may have lost a solid percentage of new time players to the tutorial. Once you manage to master controlling your ship then the rest comes pretty easily. 
---
I spent an hour listening to my best buddy rage at the game because he just could not get that ship to land, he threw up his hands in frustration and has never played since.
---
The hits keep coming..
---
I‚Äôm always missing the left leg.
---
I've wondered about that exact thing too. I def remember seeing those "vigilante" posts a while back.
---
As long as I can just play and make Atoms without paying for what I really want, I wouldn't care, haha.
---
I appreciate your advice, but no other plan has required me to leave the server. I'll try it now and report back.
---
Ouch. Been there, my friend. 
---
Never duplicated items. I bought and used tse guns and bought long coats after days of farming legit ones only to have griefing players kill the vendor as I press trade. 1k a piece. Those guns are duped. I know that. The long coat was cheap, therefore duped. I guess I'll live out my days as a cheater. 
---
Bahahaha he got owned. 
---
It's storing stuff in a database, it will have transaction logs. 
---
Pretty sure the reason it's been taking so long, is that fact they've been collecting logs and going through them to make sure they're not banning the wrong people.
---
idk i tested the sentinel by shooting the ground at my feet with an explosive gun..with the sentinel on and without the sentinel..when i took off the sentinel i took more damage..so i took less damage with it on and i was firing my weapon...oh wait maybe i forgot to replace the sentinel with another piece when i took it off..lol back to the testing
---
Both of you aren't taking in to account the bigger picture  
---
proof = money.
---
&gt;Yes, in competent development companies.  Its become pretty clear that BA are building those tools still.
---
Ad Hominem. Cute
---
&gt; This is a company that told you that their CSR don't have that  capability - even though, generally in server based games they would. 
---
Oh did they? Link?
---
I believe it is a 30 minute event, Damn hard by yourself with that time frame but doable I believe.
---
Feedback, Request, Suggestion: Can the amount of Purified Water held in the  purifiers be raised. Are we to sit there for an hour to get 60?  The  Industrial holds 5 but is suppose to make 60 an hour. Can this be fixed ???
---
Sorry but I do not agree, and you're not proving anything. He could have easily put a powered door and pushed the button. It's not relevant. You may not like it but they are mechanics in the game. 
---
why should I do that
---
I bought Elder Scrolls Online and paid the subscription fee, game wasn‚Äôt enjoyable to me, but a year or two later after it went free to play and had a lot of work done it was pretty good. 
---
It still says "find plans to build this object" after switching servers.
---
no they get perma bans to ..  as it should
---
What purpose does underarmor serve in power armor?  Aside from the extra stat points, it would serve no purpose other than if your entire chest, leg or arm piece (plus the frame) was completely sheared through providing your bare skin with less than 10 DR even with any shielded lining.  If something sheared through a piece of power armor, some extra tough cloth isn't going to make up the difference.  It's like putting a piece of kevlar behind a hardened steel plate and expecting that to make any difference in stopping an armor piercing/incendiary .50 BMG.  
---
It's kinda like one of my DnD players asking if they can wear elven chain under their full plate.  I say sure, if you want to carry the extra 10lbs, but the chain isn't providing you extra AC until your plate armor is shredded to pieces.  If someone hits you with an artillery piece, then I'll take into account the extra AC the underlying chain armor might provide, but chain is terrible against piercing/bludgeoning attacks, so I'll take that into account as well.
---
Power armor is already stronger than any conventional armor even in bone stock form.  It has a hidden rad resist multiplier similar to a damaged hazmat suit, has additional DR from a helmet, is far more durable, and can be modded with an enemy highlighter, an energy field that allows you to tag all ghouls surrounding you during a whitesprings nuke, arm mods that let you power attack all day long on the SBQ and +100 carry weight leg mods.
---
I have a stealth rifleman and a power armor axe/sledge melee alt, and the power armor build is 1000% more efficient.  I can easily charge at a lvl 91 scorched deathclaw during an SBQ and smash it in one shot with a one star instigating super sledge modded with a heated coil.  My rifleman still has to dump 2-3 headshots to take out a basic lvl 68 super mutant with 2.5x sneak damage, a shitload of perk investment, a TSE bolt action rifle that took months to acquire and 5 bespoke armor pieces, plus the near impossibility of getting shielded raider lining.
---
I'm using the power armor melee as a quick and dirty way of farming good gear for the sniper that I actually want to improve.  The hardest part of the melee build was getting a lvl 50 T-51b right leg off a RNG power frame.  Then someone came up to me a week later and gave me T-51 leg plans for free simply because I was in a T-51 suit.
---
The last thing power armor needs is more advantages over conventional armor.  Just for the simple fact that conventional armor users are forced to give up all armor in favor of a hazmat suit when walking into a blast zone.
---
*woosh*
---
The human body is much more fragile than you might thank. It doesn‚Äôt take too much to keep you from working for 3 months. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs fishy simply because it‚Äôs not that rare of a thing to happen.
---
And while waiting for information is nice, we already know that Bethesda doesn‚Äôt have the best track record lately, thinking they could have fucked up isn‚Äôt a stretch.
---
Legendary creatures are disappearing before loot can be taken. Has happened everywhere I have no specific place. 
---
Yeah, one set for Camping, one set for Soloing, one set for Groups, one set for Farming. I would use the hell out of that feature.
---
When is the most recent update this week?
---
Ah my bad, my original comment was intended for Phoenix not you. 
---
That's completely understandable, but there are a few issues with this:
---
1) The message sent with the ban does not mention this at all. If this is truly the reason they've been banned, why not be explicit about it so that other players who are doing the same thing will be warned that it is a bannable offense?
---
2) Pretty much every online game allows this, and some actively encourage it like WoW where you can mail your alt characters items to store for you. So players coming from those backgrounds wouldn't see anything wrong with it because, again, there's no explicit warning about it.
---
&gt;Do you remember how many posts were made about the trade stealing exploit? Because there was never a single article of proof that it ever existed. And yet people were here, lying about it multiple times every day.
---
I do, since it actually happened to me.
---
The community witch-hunt where I received a bunch of PMs accusing me variously of:
---
- Attempting to elicit sympathy to get people to give me free stuff
---
- Lying just to cause trouble
---
- Being a genuine moron who accidentally dropped items on the ground and forgot about them
---
- Being a paid agent of Rockstar Games hired to make the RDR2 launch more successful by spoiling the competition
---
marked the point where I just gave up on the game and moved on.
---
You are of course free to conclude I'm now doing unpaid 'freelance' shilling on behalf of a game on a system I don't own, but the TopMinds level paranoia where every complaint must be a conspiracy to undermine the game is truly delusional.
---
Banned here  also .... I bought caps from mmoko  website....instead of caps i was forced to take 50k nuka cola.
---
I like your kind that when everything crumble around and you still believe what other said it will be fine. 
---
You are the perfect person that I will send when stuff goes wrong and tell you yes we got a plan coming don‚Äôt worry just keep going into the mine field. Don‚Äôt worry we are behind you. 
---
sure but when you go back to him to buy it does it say known or is it there to buy
---
I guess if they picked up the items, even if they they dropped them somewhere else, they could have triggered the relevant server side code. 
---
It is hard to be accurate, when Bethesda isn't the most transparent on the issue (somewhat understandable). 
---
I think your the only person to mention that it‚Äôs a TEMPORARY BAN. Until they can fix the problem. Some sort of system cleanse of all duped items.
---
i recall one other game did do this. was it gta? someone help me out here.
---
Odd, I've played a Brotherhood turncloak, a Railroad saboteur, an Institute Courser, a wizard with no allegiance, an Enclave soldier, taken over the BoS, joined the Brotherhood of Gold, and dozens of other playthroughs.
---
You have no imagination or don't know how to use mods if you say this with a straight face.
---
Banned with email here today.....it's no lie
---
Play Red Dead 2, better than this shit ass game.
---
He‚Äôs an outlier. People didn‚Äôt bother to read about how much he really plays and why. You can‚Äôt convince me that *everyone* else complaining seriously plays as much as him.
---
They have passed that requirement for me. 
---
Huh..
---
But somehow duped items found itself on your person?
---
E.g. Oh that bag of meth you found on me, isn‚Äôt mine. I‚Äôm just holding it for someone else.
---
Riiiiiiiiiight.. santi clause or the tooth fairy gave it to for being SUCH A GREAT GUY..lolz
---
It‚Äôs only a witch hunt.. if you‚Äôre a witch.  
---
I find your faked over entitled sense of indignation amusing. Lolz
---
Nice.
---
It's not the truth that existed.
---
The truth that existed at the time was a giant "Five Minute Hate" thread where people who actually fell victim to this particular bug were accused of lying and/or being paid agents of competing game studies sowing discord.
---
I'm more than slightly bitter about that whole episode.
---
you know the biggest problem with your tinfoil hat theory?  
---
If they wanted to kill the game they could just pull the plug. they do not need your permission to turn off the servers.
---
Them Russian Trolls that hated on The Last Jedi are at it again!
---
I just posted soemething related and have a working hypothesis that some of these reports may be from people who were actively involved in vigilante duper hunting ( https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as2uv9/could_duper_hunters_be_caught_up_in_these/ )
---
So you are assuming Bethesda won't use the server logs as the source of their choices to ban a player?
---
Yeah, for sure OP is staring at a stack of Cosmo magazines from the 90‚Äôs.
---
Your first mistake was being loyal to a company. You're a statistic. 
---
So am I.. lolz
---
what's the time stamp of their email?
---
Do you even read? Take my downvote.
---
I got an email saying my account was suspended for code of conduct violation but I am still able to play the game. I have a mule for all my extra ammo/crafting/aid and have interacted with duper dropped loot, I have not duped myself but have interacted with dupers (i.e. trading cause nowadays you'll never not encounter a duper in trades). Now I have a friend that has helped me transfer stuff to my mule and he can't log in.
---
Note it does not matter if they duped and or cheated. Instead they are using the games log files and a bot to tally up a list of rare items and if it hits 100,000 you get banned. I do not think it cares if you ever had the items all at once and all that matters is that over the course of the 30 days that amount passed through your inventory.
---
In other words if they flagged 5mm rounds as rare and over the course of the month you crafted 100,000 rounds than you get banned. Also what if you only crafted 50,000 5mm and also 50,000 .50 rounds that may also get you banned. 
---
Note this is just speculation as we do not know the criteria they are using and chances are never know. As telling us will only give the cheaters a firm work on how not to get caught and defeat the purpose of this.
---
You would think, with the dwindling playerbase, that they wouldn‚Äôt waste any time banning anyone right now, but that seems to be all they care about. Kill the game, Bethesda, I love it :)
---
excavator
---
Just some company for a change. My old crew doesnt play anymore from the lack of content. 
---
Really wanting to do the glassed cavern quest again but with a crew and do some other things, I'm up to do whatever. So lonely lmao 
---
Is there a difference when the immediate outcome, NO TOUCHY DA GAME is the same?
---
You sound like a neckbeard who doesn't understand that mindlessly sucking a developers dick just leads to lazier and lazier games getting released.
---
To be frank.
---
Just apply that logic to the rest of the world for a moment to see how hilarious it actually is. 
---
You don't think competitors would have anything to gain from driving the self-inflicted nails in deeper?
---
I don't think there's *paid* trolls, but I wouldn't be surprised.  The proliferation of misinformation on social media is extreme and already proven to be used as a weapon by interests.
---
As much as this sucks, you can't really be surprised can you?  Did you expect they would treat you different than every other person who bought the game?  By continuing to play, your telling them that your ok with it.  The smartest thing you can do is to put your energy into something else and move on.
---
No worries man. I post in the wrong spot too sometimes lol...

Lolz I suggest you stop playing the game in support of your banned duping brethren.
---
It has come back up as (known).
---
https://imgur.com/a/AeBLZdz
---
Then good.  You're in the small minority of players that haven't had issues.  Hope you have fun. 
---
Meh. There‚Äôs always rust..
---
Wait, does this mean you've had over 90,000 of an item? Or 10,000? The most I have of an item is 650 springs, since I've been farming them for 300 hours.
---
‚ÄúYou have banned the only legitimate player base left playing your game‚Äù 
---
What the hell is that comment about? There‚Äôs a hell of a lot of legitimate players playing who didn‚Äôt get banned so I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre trying to say here. 
---
Also you have any screenshots of your game when you log in or just that generic email? If they take away your ban will you post an update? I don‚Äôt appreciate when people try to stir up shit with no evidence on this sub, and as someone who frequents this sub and has 900+ hours in the game you obviously understand. 
---
From what I understand they looked at about 400 rare items and took all the players that had a much too large number of those items and are banning based on that. So if you just bought one maybe-duplicated rifle you are ok. but if you had in your possession a LOT of rare items, you are in trouble.
---
Level 4 of fort defiance has a PA station that spawns alternating t51, t60 and t45 bits and they‚Äôre usually high level, I picked up a t51 bit at the Sam turret camp south of Watoga station too
---
I just posted my WALL, apparently we were writing at the same time! I quizzed a bunch of people some were Confirmed dupers I added as friends, some where vigilantes who got banned without having items in their stash or character. So its historical of rare items, this is of course speculation but I get into more detail here  
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as2xm1/speculation\_on\_the\_482000\_bans/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as2xm1/speculation_on_the_482000_bans/)
---
Lol just learned a reddit lesson.
---
Eh yeah. What‚Äôs the difference between temp and perm ban when you can‚Äôt play?  Lolz
---
Why they'd even choose to be involved in banning people is just a bad idea anyway. Imo manual bans shouldn't ever be a thing, devs need to just release their game and let cheaters cheat and let their own anticheat work for them. If someone dupes and it's exploiting a bug that the devs missed, that's their fault, not the players for taking advantage of a developer oversight.  Patch it and release a tool to retroactively seek out duped items and destroy them, lol. 
---
The people running games these days are going about exploitation in the games the wrong way.
---
Make sure to rest in bed at the start of your session for +5% XP.
---
I seemed to have to many rare items and I have no where near anything of some of the traders on these forms apparently 2 sets of armor 50 misc peices ranging from 1 to 3* and 30 to 40 ish mixed guns is to much and a suspendable offense.....
---
at least you think you know where your area would be. 
---
mine was smushed out of existant since they put summersville dam right behind charleston.
---
I think sometimes when you cross a kind of invisible border between zones your AP refills. Maybe not what you are talking about though, but I have had times when I could sprint for a very long distance and my AP would keep refilling as I exited and entered new areas.
---
Considering that he spent most of every waking hour on this game, then I do think it's fishy. Not impossible; fishy. Not that he has to be able to work after three months.
---
Thinking that people will make up a story about being innocently banned is not a stretch either. This is why we should wait for info before coming to a conclusion, and certainly before jumping on a hate train.
---
If you want a theory: what may have happened was this guy DID play for 900 hours, and ended up, through the use of account mules, accumulating an absurd amount of stuff on a new character to the point that the ban process triggered. Heck, he may have even played this long and DID dupe, for all we know.
---
But, he also said that he never accumulated over 100,000 of anything. So now we have to wait and see.
---
Only one place it could be. Very NW tip of WV that rams up against PA and Ohio. So top left corner of the map.
---
Imagine believing this. 
---
I'm down
---
I don‚Äôt believe you that having a large collection of different guns gut you banned. You did something else, or there was mistake. A LOT of people collect weapons, and I am not seeing them being banned. 
---
Perhaps  of the game wasn't so full of bugs in the first place  we wouldn't have this situation now
---
**They want this game to die so they can give up on it**
---
I‚Äôm going to start hoarding energy ammo for that exact reason when they put the stash up to 800 in the next update and I have space to put it, doesn‚Äôt hurt to be prepared lol
---
Sorry. They're both right arms. 
---
I'm carrying several legendaries that I have picked up over the past several days. 
---
Again, if that character solely exists to bypass the stash limit, its an exploit.
---
no idea if it is tomorrow. but it should be this week.
---
* **Stash Limit Increase to 800** ‚Äì We know this  continues to be a big one. Next week, we are raising the Stash limit  from 600 to 800 pounds. Like last time, we are constantly evaluating  storage space and discussing ways we can make improvements, but not at  the expense of server stability. We hope this additional increase to 800  pounds will help you store even more of the awesome item‚Äôs you‚Äôve found  in the Wasteland!
---
* **The M79 Grenade Launcher and the Auto Grenade Launcher are now classified as Heavy Weapons**  ‚Äì A fix is being made to properly label the M79 Grenade Launcher and  Auto Grenade Launcher as Heavy Weapons. They will also now correctly  benefit from all Heavy Weapons perks except for Heavy Gunner, as we  believe it makes more sense for these weapons to benefit from the  Demolitions Expert perk. Boom!
---
* **Accidentally Damaging another player‚Äôs C.A.M.P. will no longer tag you as WANTED**  ‚Äì From our Known Issues list, players who accidentally shoot, hit, or  disturb another player‚Äôs C.A.M.P. will no longer become WANTED and  viewed as engaging in PvP. Instead you must actively work to be  malicious to another player and DESTROY their C.A.M.P. objects for it to  be considered a PvP action and become marked as WANTED. We will closely  monitor player feedback to this change.
---
* **Player Icons now display in more areas throughout the game**  ‚Äì Once Patch 6 arrives, hovering over a player on the map will now  display their player icon, and Workshops will display their owners‚Äô  player icons, too. Additionally, when viewing a turret created by  another player, you‚Äôll now be able to see the owner‚Äôs name and player  icon in the turret‚Äôs nameplate.
---
* **Quest containers during the Feed the People and Path to Enlightenment events now only accept quest items**  ‚Äì With this fix, players can no longer accidentally transfer items from  their inventories into these quest containers. As a result, you should  now be able to complete these events without fear of losing non-quest  items.

---
Im not arguing either way on the steel acc bit, but can you elaborate on running 3 accounts at the same time?
---
Hows that work? Is this a PC thing? (I play on xbox)
---
**they want this game to die so they can save money**
---
You offered to much I got rad worms from her
---
Fair enough man! I did it. Thought eh, may as well get something for nothing. Just something more for my collection now haha
---
Temp they'll give it back when they have the ability to remove junk and other stuff they didn't program. Perm it's gone forever. I would guess the temps should be about 2-3 weeks
---
I planned from the get-go to not to buy FO76 until private server modding was released and shown to be working. With the horrible launch, I keep an eye out on the game's progress to see if support or time tables shift with all the crap happening. As someone with 8000+ hours in the FO and ES universes, I'm here keeping up to date with my favorite franchises' studio, and I still might buy this one if Bethesda maintains support and opens up private server modding as planned. If not, I'll wait for ES6 which I'll probably preorder like the rest of the dummies. I can replay Oldrim, Tale of Two Wastes, or FO4 till then. 
---
Add and subtract?  I think you're giving Beth too much credit...
---
The timing of his post now, and his last one seems a little too... Convenient. Something isn't adding up for me.
---
The last inside the vault gave us *some* info, but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôll drop tomorrow.
---
Right now there seems to be some error going on with Bethesda having banned innocent accounts as well as guilty ones, might push it back a bit if that‚Äôs the case.
---
I‚Äôm a snowflake now? What is this info wars? Your problem with the had anything to do with this thread? I enjoy the game and not because I am sucking Bethesda‚Äôs dick. I think it has just about the best ,
---
character creation they‚Äôve had since morrowind and certainly the best of any fallout game I‚Äôve played. I‚Äôm sorry if that some how evades your simple mind that some people do actually enjoy the game but I can‚Äôt really expect anything else from someone that called other ‚Äúsnowflakes.‚Äù 
---
same
---
I'm pretty sure that those are the letters that are already known and posted in the Enclave Bunker. I could be wrong tho.
---
the problem is there is no choises at all, no matter what you do, you end up saying yes.
---
same problem with F4 too, but by now i dont play it for the story anymore anyways (1K+ hrs)
---
When can we expect to have this resolved on bethesdas part? When can we expect to have our accounts re-activated? 
---
1 step foward and 2 steps back, once again Bethesda.  New patch and QOL updates, yay! Oh wait, it reintroduced old bugs.  New dupe detection and ban wave, yay!  Oh wait, it's falsely banned loads of legit players.  They literally cannot get anything right.  NOTHING.  Every time it looks like they do something great and positive it quickly falls apart and reveals their incompetence.  
---
What kills me is these comment chains debating the ban risk of each persons personal scrap steel habbits when it says **rare** items.
---
Lolz look on the bright side. All of these dupers getting banned now means an overall better gaming experience for those of us, still playing. 
---
Look we can finally get new content and more importantly a stable platform, to play in.
---
Yep it‚Äôs a great day to play,  Fallout 76! üëç
---
Never seen this
---
^^This 100%
---
So if you picked up some crap in a bag somewhere, or killed someone in PvP, you could very well have picked up duped loot without ever knowing it. And then they ban you for it.
---
Greaaaaaaaaat system guys.
---
&gt; It's storing stuff in a database, it will have transaction logs.
---
That's not necessarily the case, no.  Ultimately there're lots of types of databases with lots of different theories of data storage.  And the idea of looking at transaction logs for something like this, in the sense of, say, SQL server transaction logs... oof.  You'd be writing a lot of code to do it, and every line you write is the potential for more errors.  
---
The assumption that they have every transaction logged in a meaningful way is not a safe one to make without knowing more than either of us do, though.  
---
Good write up,  interesting points.  I think my friend falls in that category of picking up loot and distributing. I think that's jail time right? 
---
Level 39, played FO3 on. I think I know how to play, it's just an annoyance 
---
I keep seeing these posts on /r/all. That's how I'm here now. It's not just people obsessively coming back to the sub. 
---
So I jumped on 76, started at the vault and went straight down to Flatwoods, searching every location on the way and also looted Flatwoods. That took 45 minutes, and I collected 300 steel. If someone plays 200 hours and picks up every single thing and scraps it, in total you should have well past 5-10k of steel total. Quests give steel, robots give steel, weapons broken down give steel. That 300 is just from junk. Im on the other end of the spectrum from you, playing that long and only having 5k seems unrealistic.  
---
P.S Im not trying to be argumentative or mean, just trying to explain things from my point of view.
---
OP, I wish you the best of luck in getting this resolved - and hopefully sooner than a future patch. Like you I have a bank alt aka mule, and like you I've been harassed because of it (not lately, but during the duper hysteria). 
---
Looking at the ban reports and sifting through the weird posts like these are conspiracies by disgruntled youtubers etc leads me to one conclusion:  Mass, repeat ban waves cause more drama and provide more entertainment than the end game. That's not a slam on BGS nor am I mocking your situation. Its just not good for the game itself, say what you will about dupers or other exploiters. I hope ban waves become unnecessary in future so we can all focus on the content and improving the experience. Crucially I hope they handle what bans are necessary with more care and feedback than the E2E push button process in place now.
---
Again, best of luck solving this OP.
---
My working theory is exp is counted as an item. The one thing I do faster than most is level up. 
---
I do enjoy the game.  I also know that developing a multi layer complex game and auto sorting though account inventories are two very different creatures. 
---
Its not a new copy, just a different character in alot of cases. I got a lvl 15 I made to get the handmade plans back before they changed it. Then loaded him down with tons of random legendary items from ws farm runs just cause i still wanted to be a hoarder 
---
You didn‚Äôt read the pic? Lolz
---
Bethesda the game manufacturer claims he duped. He attached a screenshot of Bethesda‚Äôs reasons for banning.
---
The amount of effort people put in to defend large companies continues to astound me. 
---
If that's the case I hope some type of solution or clarification would come out sooner than later.
---
Except you can do it on any subreddit. If other people have done it here as well, you can too.
---
No sympathy for bud. I was being sarcastic.
---
Todd be like:  
---
Execute order 76
---
You don't need a group. When an event is about to finish,send a squad invite to a random on the map. Untill the timer pass,you're actually in a team,even he never squad up.
---
Easy way is to grab a workshop and send squad request while the bar is running.
---
The same can be done for the challenge of photos in team.
---
I don't even know anything about that game, and I'm losing interest in it already. As much as I have loved Fallout 76 and still do, it's been really frustrating and it's one of those things where things have gone wrong, but things aren't always black and white. Dupers aren't some evil people. They are just regular people who have fun in different ways. And through their actions they allowed a lot of people to get a lot more fun out of this game than endlessly grinding Whitesprings and SBQ.
---
I always try to share legendaries especially in the Uranium Fever event. I also try to avoid one shotting mobs in Whitesprings to at least let other gets xp and loot from even the normal mobs.
---
Didn't ask you to believe anything you opinion means very little I was just stating the facts of what I had on my account and all Bethesda of late has is there mistakes its getting old fix the game so I can play in peace and not have to deal with all this bullshit.
---
Tentatively scheduled for Friday the 22nd between 2-3pm.
---
That won't happen, no one remembers shitty Zenimax launches. Do you remember ESO's launch?
---
Time to walk away from thus game......also banned here....
---
I can craft it for you and give it the Resistant lining. DM me for my PSN handle.
---
How come the watoga bots?
---
Todd be like:
---
Execute order 76!
---
That's completely inapplicable, just as it was the first time around. Thanks for playing, though. 
---
I remember playing it at release and not playing it again. I remember not buying Fallout 4. Though I did get it on sale in a bundle with Skyrim on PS4 later so yeah....
---
A different point of view is always welcome. :]
---
One thing to keep in mind is that I'm not farming 24/7, and I don't think others typically are either. From building to reading/listening to crafting to survival maintenance to basic exploration (in areas that have no metal lying around like forests), there are plenty of reasons to not persist a certain steel income. 
---
This is why I mentioned that it would be possible to get that much if I *only* farmed steel, like made it a priority. But I didn't see a reason why anyone would do that for so long as to have hundreds of thousands of steel. 
---
All that said, I've had a bunch of responses with good explanations of how it's possible to get more steel than I first thought likely. So I'd say I'm flexible on this point, even if I still have to raise an eyebrow at someone accruing and holding on to so much of the resource (or hell, any resource!)
---
1. The message sent was a copy/pasta letter, I doubt he was banned for specifically using a mule.  The amount of transactions with that mule may have set off some red flags for them though, or it could have been a "false" ban.  I don't know the reason for the ban, but in my eyes it was rightful because of the things OP has admitted in his post...Muleing and dual boxing, both of which are acceptable in other games and while not specifically forbidden in writing in FO76, my spidey senses say they aren't allowed.  This is of course only my opinion.  No one but Bethesda (and possibly op) knows the real reason for the ban.
---
2) I agree, I haven't played any game that has specifically banned people for using a mule but the lack of an in game mechanic for same account toons to interact says to me its a no no.  WoW is a poor example because there is an in game mechanic to trade with yourself.  Just because a cliff doesn't have a fence in front of it doesn't mean its okay to walk off.
---
Too many people are blindly loyal to a broken game. It's easier for them to just call everyone who got banned a cheater than accept the fact that some of them were falsely banned and therefore bethesda screwed up yet again.
---
Using the flamethrower glitch to level up to 400+, it's possible to gain an epic crap ton of fuel. 
---
Uh, no. I am still subbed to the subreddits of games I enjoyed playing but am taking a break from. Like /r/PathofExile, /r/Rimworld, /r/Factorio etc. I'll go through spells where I play them a crap load for a few months, then take a 6-12 month break. 
---
I still like seeing the posts from those subs on my front page and check them every couple of days just to keep up with what's going on.
---
Here's hoping your good man.
---
Just hit the god damn reset button already thats what they need to do. Sorry agrravated :)
---
Yeah, this is the straw that broke the camel's back for me. Fuck Bethesda and fuck the rest of their shitty, money-grabbing products. I mean, the best Fallout in recent times wasn't even their game lol. I hope they fail and take EA with them. I'm sorely disappointed.
---
Hey OP I contacted Bethesda support via Twitter and called in PC Gamer and RPS to look into writing about this.. considering doing a video about it myself. Will keep you posted if I hear anything.
---
Oh shit I just remembered that ESO came out after Skyrim lol so people didn't have a lesson to learn yet
---
Man how do you even play. I‚Äôm only reaching 300 and many times I have retards attempt to kill me to make some easy caps. The ‚Äòrewards‚Äô system brought out the mole rats inside many imbeciles. 
---
Getting that addon was such a huge QoL improvement, and actually makes leveling past 50 worthwhile. Before getting it I almost never moved perk cards around because it was annoying. Now I'm actively building different loadouts for different uses.
---
That abandoned bog town often has one. I actually went there yesterday hunting one for the weekly achievement. Found one but he died fast to my bloody commando build (although I‚Äôm using an AA 10mm SMG). Level 93?
---
The silly thing is shortly after, I traveled to whitesprings train station. Guess what was waiting for me there? Yup. A diseased 93 behemoth. I‚Äôve never seen one there before!
---
What is it?
---
You can easily post a few imgur links. You just don't have any emails to take pics of, that's the problem. 
---
I found him today as well I‚Äôm surprised a lot of people encountered him today 
---
Well yes I get that they need to do an overhaul.   I mean white springs used to be insane with loot before.  Then they took it away.  But not only did they do that but really lowered down the essence of 3 star legendaries.  Counting that we havent even seen 5 stars yet.  Just looking to farm something decent as west tek is not giving me nothing interesting after 8hs.  Lots of 1 and 2s as well from 3 star mutants
---
You should be their customer support rep. Do a better job
---
Good luck getting snot ear 
---
oh, cool. ill check it out
---
Wait... So they're banning players until they fix their shitty code? 
---
u/LadyDevaan u/LoneVaultWanderer 
---
&gt;‚Äúplayers‚Äù trying to ruin the game
---
The game needs no help from it's **Fans** to accomplish this. Bethesda has already outdone anyone looking to cause problems for the franchise.
---
I think they were confused on how to deal with the huge surge of goodwill following the last inside the vault so they made an inexplicable ban wave in order to get the community back into a foul mood.
---
Did you even read the fucking message they sent? Holy shit you are beyond wrong in this post. They literally gave the reason for the ban and it has nothing to do with play time or items or anything you said.
---
LMFAO and 14 people dumb enough to agree without reading
---
I got shot by one of those whitespring robots yesterday. He was waddling around shooting at the roof when I walked past and he shot me, then went right back to shooting at the roof. He ignored my intense glare of disapproval. 
---
As of the time of writing this, there are still 0 replies from Bethesda in this thread. This definitely seems like a make it or break it point for most of the remaining fanbase, Beth needs to address this immediately or lose what little faith people have left in them
---
is that guy lying too then? id like to see you in my boat, wrongfully banned from a game you enjoy, no way of making noise about the issue besides posting to reddit and youtube, and when i do assholes like you just think we are lying. ffs in what way am i lying? there is proff on my xbox DVR where i recorded all of my inventory and stash no duped items
---
He did the mothman math
---
Thank you for sharing that you have fun with the video game. I never said it wasn't complex or that making a video game is easy. But for some reason Bethesda has had the same issues in their games since Skyrim came out. Bethesda also seems to have problems that other companies don't seem to deal with anywhere near as often or drastic as Bethesda.
---
in other words.. private(LOCAL!!!) server is step A.
---
forget the "official spawns" and just go to the mods...
---
F76 has insane potentional and i do hope bethblblala will at some point realize they can never make what the community can and they should profit on the atom store once the community has localhosts for this installment.
---
It's fun, isn't it? I usually never use my tse for pvp for obvious reasons, but in pve I found it extremely enjoyable to kill things especially with bloodymess. I do hope this only an error so I can return to my daily atom challenges.
---
Ironic twist.
---
Duped gear is like the ring in Lord of the Rings and once the dupe hunters acquired the duped gear they decided to keep some.
---
What is the infinite stim glitch?
---
Yet another reason not to use a console.
---
Not only are you a pompous asshole to someone making an obvious joke, but you are wrong and have posted lies as fact here because you are too lazy to read the actual email. How embarrassing.
---
Could be, especially since it isn't 100,000 at any one time. It is 100,000 *in the last month*. So 10,000 here, 10,000 there, and it adds up to 100,000+ total.
---
And yet no one says remember Fallout New Vegas. 
---
Oh, man. I got called out for good reason. You were talking about technical data and I responded about the treasure maps. My bad. I get crap from technical data too, but I keep doing it anyway. Sorry about my confusion. Your post was very clear. 
---
Considering that most of the community spent the last week noticing how well the scan script seemed to have worked and how elegant their solution was to the potential of blameless players unknowingly having illegal items that seems....unlikely. 
---
They probably spent the last week going through the data from the scan identifying problematic accounts (ie those who had egregious numbers of rare items).
---
Even AWOL Armaments seems to have been nerfed. The three star Gutsy dropping one star junk. 
---
seems to me, if you want to preserve your right to play is to stop playing temporarily. till this is sorted. taking all from playera AND bethesda words in a grain of salt. it's all plausible claims.
---
Hang on...
---
If the workshop is unclaimed and I claim it, can anyone at anytime just come kill me? Or do they have to initiate the workshop claiming.
---
Sorry this is concerning lol 
---
After reading the posts on the sub, no, the game is the dumpster fire and the sub is acting accordingly because it's based around a game that's a dumpster fire.
---
Why the fuck are you defending companies blanket banning people who don't deserve it? Fuck Bethesda and fuck your shill ass.
---
I was excited for  Starfield  but not any more, never will buy another BETA again. I tried to stay with this and be supportive but I don't even have any good weapons (1 star 10mm 30% more damage to robots and a 1 star quad capacity shotgun) guns and that's it, never copied anything but got a ban for rare items... be great to know what rare is? lol
---
Hey there, when you get a moment I sent you a PM to get your ticket number so our Support team can investigate this.
---
Nah son. Bank alts have legitimately always been in mmos.
---
It literally says his account was flagged for collecting at least 100,000 of specific rare items over the course of a month.  How the fuck does that have nothing to do with items exactly?
---
Ouch. That me laugh 50% more and screwed my mutations.
---
At this point they'd be driving the nails through the wood and into the dirt below...  Bethesda drove the nails too deep from the start.  It wouldn't even be beating a dead horse... it would be beating a dead horse that was devoured by local wildlife, and then crapped back out.
---
There‚Äôs another problem I‚Äôve found with mutations, strange in numbers, and teammates leaving. I run 2 accounts, one is just a water farmer but he‚Äôs got mutations (including Empath) for boosting my main‚Äôs stats too. I run strange in numbers. Sometimes if the alt account logs out from inactivity, my mutations (most noticeably Marsupial) bug out *unless I take off Strange in Numbers*. All goes back to normal if I reconnect my alt. 
---
It‚Äôs possible this is triggered by Rad Worms but doesn‚Äôt get noticed until the team mate disconnects, I‚Äôm not sure, I don‚Äôt pay much attention to diseases... but I‚Äôve definitely had it occur when I didn‚Äôt -currently- have radworms when my alt DC‚Äôd
---
Junk items in odd locations doesn't bother me as there are many reasons why they could be there. Someone dumped them there for whatever reason, a previous camp was there a some point, etc etc.
---
I've yet to figure reasons why insects carry all the things they carry sometimes. Seriously, I know they are bigger than pre war ones but still!
---
There must be a way around this though.  Can the game figure who is actually participating in the event and who isn't? I'm not saying someone who wasn't there should be able to loot bodies after the event is over.  I'm saying that if someone is at the event, and is shooting enemies, they should be able to loot any downed enemies that are there.
---
Or remove the strange in numbers card. That fixes it too
---
FNV was mostly playable and had way more content tho. Takes some amount of work for a multiplayer game to have less content than a single player, and I say this as a lover of FO76. AND is not currently banned
---
I forgot the name of the perk card, but it automatically uses a stim when you fall below a certain percentage of health. From what people tell me you have to use it in a combination of other cards and it makes you invincible. I never asked how it worked because temptation. I can ask around again and let you know what I find.
---
Holy shit dude I literally just read your earlier post. I was gonna go on adventure like you suggest and saw this. Wow. They fucked yo big here
---
I'm sure OPs hair is not Karen enough.
---
Great.  Work 54 days straight to have 3 day weekend,  and one will be wasted on patch.  Hell yeah.
---
For a post apocalyptic setting with no rules, this game sure does have a lot of rules.
---
Well, thanks for returning and sharing.
---
Right, I'm just talking about the point costs. Maxing them all out is 9 points for 60% damage increase, whereas it's only 3 points for 30%.
---
they should have opted for a "official server" and "local" and/or "private" server.  
---
this game is not a fiasco entirely, it still has the huge potentional that everyone wished it would become but isn't.
---
its not dead yet, but bethblalala should really do something soon, the best thing would be to just let ppl host it local or private.
---
but even a dlc, or a roadmap, .. or heck anything.. , and thats what killing the last potentional, and thats why its a fiasco.
---
&gt;  but NPCs are what makes a game good 
---
I disagree.
---
If this is true, the default action after reporting someone should *not* be "ban and sort it out later." There are way too many screeching children angry about being killed in PvP who report *everyone* they lose to.
---
However, I'll reserve judgement because the previous wave of these were lies by cheaters. However, this post seems much more honest and credible than the rest...
---
I‚Äôm not banned nor do I dup (and I have no friends so I don‚Äôt know anyone that does). Nice try though, gold star. 
---
Wow I can feel the butt-hurt from here. Play how you want, just don‚Äôt be surprised at those who take vigilante justice. It is the wasteland after all. 
---
I didn‚Äôt buy it precisely because it‚Äôs just not my kind of game.   I‚Äôm more of a single player game and the extent of my multiplayer is what little PVP happens in Dark Souls/Bloodborne.
---
But i didnt know that was an offence, where is it stated that you cant pick up a loot bag just because it has a lot of items
---
dont make a claim with 0 evidence to support it.  
---
&gt;I have never once owned an item in excess of 100,000
---
Not what it states. You have, according to them, acquired more than 100,000 rare items in a 30 day period. That's 3,333 legendaries (or w/e) per day. 
---
Thank him, then ban him. Great work Bethesesa :)
---
Are we to ignore the possibility that he DID in fact dupe but says he didn't?
---
Maybe just wait for reviews and the demo or beta. We had every indication that this game was going to be shit at launch and remain that way for a long time. Customers should be fully aware by now that these live service games have a tendency to sell as a work-in-progress and the only way to keep this trend from continuing is to not buy an incomplete or broken game. I will admit  that Fallout 76 has been especially bad but I still put it on the spectrum with The Division, Destiny, and Anthem. If the demos and reviews come out and show that the game is lacking content or polish you can believe that they are probably telling the truth. 
---
Serves them right for putting justice in their own hands. Let Bethesda screw the dupers up, and their broken ass game haha.
---
The main thing I sink steal into is crafting weapons and armor and breaking them down to get all the modifications for them. With armor it seems its around every 5 to 7 you scrap you get a mod, so it takes a lot of steel , and thats just for one style of armor. I like collecting all armor and weapon mods and being able to craft anything i want. Thats why I hoard all the resources I can. If you've ever seen the movie Labyrinth, I would be the old junk lady in the junkyard.
---
Well his name is replichaun, the replicant version of a leprechaun.
---
It affects armor *rating*, period. Everything has an armor rating. So it works on everything. 
---
That being said, it doesn‚Äôt affect %damage reduction effects (things like Lone Wanderer, for instance, or Sentinel/Assassin legendary armor effects)
---
Again you fail to read, even after a second try. It says 100,000 of a single item. That's copies of one item. OP also mentions, and so do the many other people banned, that they never reached anywhere close to that many items, period.
---
Your capacity for misunderstanding is gargantuan.
---
Considering that people have been complaining nonstop about dupers, that it is a serious problem with "so many people duping," then, yes, I do think it's possible that this many people were banned for duping and then came onto the reddit to lie about it.
---
You should have taken the L and kept it when the game came out. They aren't gonna listen to you  
---
tfw not banned from playing New Vegas
---
Ironically they banned people buying them since many have wrote that they have duped and still playing the game today. 
---
Relog and try again? Log off, disable mods, try again? They certainly worked for me last I checked, but I can check again.
---
Those are basically the only 2 auto pistols outside of energy weapons, anyway.
---
Work in CS - call in with your ticket and the first person who answers just say "escalate the ticket" amd bitch and moan until you get your way.
---
dam
---
Or you could use that time to get a job :) 
---
Having lots of hours doesn‚Äôt mean you didn‚Äôt dupe, writing an ‚Äúexplanation‚Äù isn‚Äôt proof. 
---
You're applying logic to the situation. It doesn't work that way.
---
I haven't found anything, but I drop stuff off. Sometimes I come back an hour later on a slow server and the stuff is still there. Other times someone nearby will visit the box within a few minutes and I check it and the stuff I dropped is gone. So I assume they are actually picking it up. 
---
If this happens with you in PA, and if you are using the Targeting HUD or a similar helmet mod, then that is usually the reason. To my knowledge that bug was never addressed.
---
The way i did it was to first put down the long advanced tubes on the floor, then put the foundation on top of it. I done this using upwards facing connections, haven't tried with downwards connections yet.
---
Warframe has the best community in the industry
---
I stay around this sub in hopes of good news that will make me want to come back to the game. Everyday something new pushes me away. They need to get their shit together. They have no idea how to run an online community or game. 
---
At least for the daily, a regular cop uniform (there‚Äôs one at the Morgantown airport) counts, as does, reportedly, the pastor‚Äôs vestments 
---
I messaged the same guy and this is what he told me: As far as I know I just use born survivor and a I keep a lot of stimpacks on me. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt 
---
Of course he could be lying because other people told me it is a combination of perks but it‚Äôs something to go on at least. Hope it helps
---
If you rapidly move items between your characters. Their systems counts each item as one. Irregardless if it was one toon to a another. 
---
Bethesda Tweeted Tomorrow, 9AM EST
---
Definitely invest in the "Fix it Good" perk, so when you build or repair any armor, it goes to 200%. Makes the springs and Ultracite count.
---
For me:
---
1: The shit storms are entertaining (on both sides).
---
2: I am a huge fallout fan and a bit of a fallout lore nerd, so i wanna see what is happening lore-wise.
---
3: I was interested in the concept of 76 and want to see where they push it (especially if there is an offline mode one day). 
---
4: But i'm not paying 80$ for a buggy mess on an outdated engine that does not properly support multiplayer. I also don't have time for proper multiplayer. After fallout 4, i am not buying another fallout game until they change the engine. I had to install mods on fallout 4 BEFORE i could launch the game because fallout 4, at launch, was CTD for ultrawide resolutions. No money to Beth until they sort what the gaming industry sorted back in 2007.
---
I crafted 125K .50 cal and 200K 5mm a while back. Took maybe 10 minutes of crafting with the rescources already on me. It looks like big numbers but it really doesn‚Äôt take that much to make ammo. Especially if you pretty much only hoard resources for it. If their system legit targets any item including ammo, they have suuuuuuper fucked this up. Rare items I can understand.
---
Banned here and never sold or bought on market place.....I guess you think we're all liars too
---
I wouldn‚Äôt bother hoarding it. Fusion cells are super common from super mutants and robots. Maybe plasma cells since they‚Äôre fairly rare, and I‚Äôm not sure how expensive to craft, but I think they‚Äôre relatively heavy too. Plasma cores, eh, I wouldn‚Äôt bother hoarding. 
---
But it all depends on how much space you have and how much you love energy weapons. 
---
This game is already ruined. No new content, no roadmap, patches that fucking suck and so much worse. 
---
It's 'just deserts,' FYI.
---
Mr Cyshox I don't feel so good
---
*fades away*
---
No, it literally says of one or more items.  If you collect 50,000 copies of RareItemA and 50,000 copies of RareItemB.  How many RareItem do you have?
---
I've combined reading comprehension with math, don't give yourself an aneurysm figuring it out.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say they make it good or bad because I‚Äôve seen it go either way but they do give more visceral context to a story and perhaps a character to become attached to and drive gameplay. NPCs do far more than a holotape can. Now that I have played Fallout 76 I would say that NPCs also show a degree of effort that Bethesda haven‚Äôt bothered with in this title. 
---
I didn't get that feeling from fallout 4. 
---
What
---
Just because you don't hear about it as often doesn't mean that it doesn't exist or doesn't happen.  Wild Card had a lot of problems when Ark was released that have been fixed and ironed out. 
---
yeah, in that case they are either lying, or should have known better based off of how Bethesda has said the dupe detection works.
---
Either way one less idiot in the game 
---
So you people want to redesign this game to be Fallout 5 by paying milions of dollars in character building, voice acting and lipsync for a multiplayee game that people already paid for. And what do those NPC's do after you finish their story, just sit there wasting server resources contributing to server lag? Or do you want human vendors? Aren't robot vendors more efficient at that? You peopld want this game to be a singleplayer so bad ig hurts. And for what, so you can finish a good story and uninstal the game the second that story is over. You already did that with all previous fallout games, just wait for Fallout 5 so you can uninstal that too after you finish your talk to NPC simulator with a good hand held story where you are the center of the univers and all your ABC decisions leed to 3 endings.
---
When it's proven this ban wave is wrong and they overturn a bunch of bans are you going to come back and address this post that's dripping in cry baby tears or just remove it so you don't look like an insufferable baby?
---
You guys are nuts
---
Heh power armor is not that great. Not when you can stack 3* features on each of 5 pieces, plus under armor.
---
You are lying, but sadly we don't expect anything else from you anymore. 
---
I remember when Rockstar started banning cheaters and this exact same fervor went out across all the forums, and I didn't buy it, it wasn't a mistake, there were just a lot of fucking cheaters. You know what happened, for months GTA V was hacker free until they exploited it again, it got bad, then the wave of bans hit, and all was quiet. Rinse an repeat that a few times over the years.
---
 I am having the same feeling about this game, the same thing will happened after all these innocents disappear from the servers, and a whole new wave of cheaters find new exploits and get banned again.
---
I'm pretty sure Bethesda didn't fuck this one up, they just fucked up the people exploiting their shitty coded game. Both ends of the spectrum suck, but the exploiters found out who has more control and authority.
---
Are you expecting to be banned?
---
I‚Äôm asking Because I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs not up to to decide whether you get banned or not. It‚Äôs Bethesda! Lolz
---
Oh in case you haven‚Äôt seen the email, folks are being banned temp or perm for DUPING, not cheating.
---
You may not see a difference but Bethesda the game manufacturer does. And they‚Äôre cleaning house.
---
Finally Regarding your post, I think you mean, BANNED not band.
---
All of the banned fallout players also were on a fallout trading board? Ya don‚Äôt say...
---
Bethesda just banned their number one fan because their game doesn't work.
---
What a bunch of moron.
---
Why do you assume he was duping? Oh right, anyone whose a higher level then you is a duper. 
---
Can‚Äôt get drunk tonight. Gotta work tomorrow 
---
There aren‚Äôt that many people complaining on here,
---
Compared to how many people are playing the game. It‚Äôs completely reasonable that these people were cheating and they didn‚Äôt want to add that to their complaint because they were embarrassed. 
---
The real problem is people that think there is some malicious intent on Bethesda‚Äôs part. They are here to make money, they don‚Äôt want to ban players if they don‚Äôt have to. They have the information that some folks have way too much going through their account and they acted on it. This isn‚Äôt a witch hunt, these people are now being punished for things they did wrong. 
---
People using the TRADING on a TRADING BOARD. Please, tell me more. 
---
If only I could charge back my credit card.....
---
Yes he is full of shit.
---
not for years, my friend. language evolves. 
---
Seriously, how does this happen? Surely you‚Äôd take their hours into account, and check their inventory to make sure they don‚Äôt have more than 100k of something? And if the system is obviously flawed, as it is, why does someone need to get traction on Reddit to get help? Why would you say there‚Äôs no appeal when the system is broken? At the very least you should say ‚Äúpost to Reddit to appeal‚Äù if that‚Äôs the *only way* to appeal it?
---
Not good enough Bethedesa. This isn‚Äôt some tiny indie company, you have the resources. 
---
I got the game the day after it came out (forgot to pick up my pre-order the day of) and I enjoyed it but haven‚Äôt touched it since that week, not because I grew board but because I went to spend time on modding I do for another game, then Red Dead Redemption came out and it‚Äôs the only game that‚Äôs been in my Xbox since. I can‚Äôt imagine playing 900 hours and getting banned for what seems to be completely illegitimate reasons.
---
Nobody interfere with this guys safe space
---
You may banned
---
Well I was working on that but now can‚Äôt login... until a future patch...
---
They didn't say they would unban anyone on the next patch. They said a "future patch." So who knows when that could be...
---
Sweet thing anyone has said to me today.
---
Bethesda: *No way someone is enjoying our game. Ban this guy.*
---
Every single time I read something new about F76, I have to double check that it's not a joke due to the absurdity of it.
---
Dupers, dupers hunters and anyone by association were banned.  Basically everyone playing with fire and not organically playing the game.  Haven‚Äôt heard of a single ban amongst people I know playing the game.  There might be an innocent or two out there but the rest were all correctly identified.
---
So ammo is classified as "rare" by Bethesda now? lol
---
Yo this conspiracy theory I thought was a joke. My jaw dropped when I realized you weren‚Äôt kidding. You think major gaming corporations are paying single minuscule individuals to write a small misleading reddit post on a sub reddit on the internet. What. How would that be of any use of time or especially resources. Why would anyone even care. I do not know how this could seem logical to anyone. WHYYY would a rival developer need to do anything to hurt this game, THIS GAME IS ALREADY HURTING. The more I think about this the more my head hurts.
---
Because I got banned from /r/Fallout for criticizing 76, something I can actually do here.
---
Seems like you have 50,000 of one and 50,000 of the other.i know you're math expert but you can't just turn itemA and itemB into item. They're two separate items. Think about it real hard buddy boy.
---
Happy to bring a small amount of positivity to this sub
---
No, Dupers should get purged. What, you think they should be allowed to cheat without punishment?
---
Bump. 
---
The Queen in "Hamlet" by Edwin Austin Abbey

---
I feel you...Friday is my lone day to put any real time into the game.
---
Wonder how long it will take to update
---
&gt; Using¬†just desserts¬†is not a serious error
---
Your own link literally calls it an error, and it doesn't use a hyphen. 
---
Not according to every archived post I've ever found while looking for it.  FO76 will also receive multiple content updates over time similar to GTA/Destiny. 
---
Thanks for the heads up.  Saw one guy on he Bazaar posting this as well. 
---
When are you usually on?
---
I'm fairly sure (like in 99.9% fairly sure) they can't, otherwise they'd not need to randomly ban people based on "if number(item) &gt; randomnumber", but with actual queries on the database.
---
I'm also on pc, I can put the BoS mod on your combat armor for free
---
It's quite simple. Don't exploit, and then you won't get banned.
---
But if you do exploit, at least have the decency to not throw a tantrum over how you got caught and punished.
---
Agreed over 600 hours and $300 in the atom shop between me and my fiance not because we needed to put that money in but because we wanted to support this game now can't play. Ivr played legitly every day since launch, thought maybe I was banned for griefing cause we have trolled alot of people, even followed them when they switched servers but got banned for duping! I'm done!
---
Dude get a life and dont put so much into a game
---
LOL! I was wondering where you went Hexi!
---
Correlation does not imply causation.
---
Going by what people admitted to, meaning either picking up random stuff in bags or buying weapons off of eBay or the bassar section. Many claim they didn‚Äôt copy stuff. 
---
I didn‚Äôt copy anything I have picked up bags I‚Äôve found full of everything but never anything great or quantities they claim.
---
I think most of the bans as of late aren‚Äôt people that copied anything.
---
If it doesnt effect sent/cav/assassin then how come my AAE lever action hurts people with it in but my other guns do not? 
---
Maybe drink them all? 
---
As I‚Äôve already stated, unless he farmed nuked whitesprings all of his hours, which his own post proves he did not, then I highly doubt he got to 450 legitimately. Not to mention, what‚Äôs the point in that, you can rack up a ton of useless perk cards you don‚Äôt need and piles of 1* star legendaries, but that‚Äôs not really improving your character.
---
Same, too. So glad I'm not alone.  My first online game, so it's even worse.  It's so stupid, but can't help it.   :)
---
and it also shows thats its more common in modern texts. and this is reddit, not my college thesis. get the fuck outta here, troll. 
---
How is that a glitch. That's the way that perk is supposed to work. But it only triggers once every 20 seconds. Auto Stim armor is once every 60 seconds. Medic Pump on PA has no cool down that I know off. All three have a limitation that the use only regular stimpacks (not diluted or super), and if the stimpack doesn't bring your health back above the threshold, it won't trigger again.
---
Was the other player in PA? If not, sounds like he was either manually activating the stimpacks, or there is a glitch to bypass the cool down timer.
---
Classic non-denial denial. You‚Äôre full of shit and deserve to be banned.
---
I'm surprised I was the first one on reddit.
---
Im banned too for literally having ‚Äúto many guns‚ÄùüòÇüíÄ they have ruined fallout 100% never playing it again. Always have played it and now its dead.
---
im 100% banned, wrongly banned thats why im making this post mate  
---
The email DOES NOT say they were flagged for having 100,000 exact copies of the SAME EXACT item.  It specifically says acquiring 100,000 OF ONE OR MORE rare items.  
---
Someone that has 50,000 copies of a bobblehead and 50,000 bottles of nuka cola is going to get flagged just like someone with 100,000 copies of a magazine.  They don't give a shit about WHAT items have been duped, they're punishing people based on the QUANTITY of the duping.
---
I think you're asking for accuracy from Bethesda that just isn't ever going to be accurate xD fallout is supposed to be fun and white knight tryhards and dupers are BOTH ruining the game for those that have fun regardless of whats going on with the masses
---
Shoot the engines. Then take out the veribots. Then go for the cargo bot. I use a Gatling gun and shot guns when they come down close. 
---
Honestly, I'm just scared to log in anymore. My handful of experiences with their support team have been extremely unhelpful. 
---
"Oh, you lost your items due to a bug? Too bad, we don't have the means to restore them." At this point, they should just pull a Final Fantasy 14 - pull the plug, fix everything over 6-12 months, and relaunch the game with a lengthy apology.
---
This is a bit all over the place but:
---
- Bring in human NPCs. Friendly and hostile.
---
- Brotherhood vs Enclave vs Raiders faction based PvP. All with different strengths, weaknesses, perks, gear and quests.
---
- this would give the workshop system more meaning as you could pass them on to your faction when you log off. 
---
- separate PvP and PvE servers.
---
- the ability to play as a Super mutant or Ghoul. I always thought an online Fallout game would have this. 
---
This guy said it best when he said &gt;This isn't some egalitarian or utopian society where everyone waits their turn to get a hit so you can get a share of the loot.
---
It's the post-apocalypse; a dog eat dog world. Those that intentionally hit below their potential to allow others to get their hit in are the exception, not the rule.
---
More I read post like these, the more satisfaction I feel for being talked out of getting this game.
---
Yep.  https://bethesda.net/community/topic/323540/upcoming-fallout-76-maintenance-feb-19-2019?language%5B%5D=en
---
Put a support ticket
---
Wow that would truly be so kind of you!! Thank you /u/fr0g_ow ! What's your ID?
---
i have .... no response, i tried sending another one but it wont even go through now. now email saying im banned or any reason for it either
---
I think its a great idea
---
You're, uh, certainly a special one. 
---
&gt;Just because you don't hear about it as often doesn't mean that it doesn't exist or doesn't happen. 
---
Agreed.   But I think we can both be honest here and say that bethesda has MORE performance issues than other big studios.  Or small ones for that matter. 
---
&gt;Wild Card had a lot of problems when Ark was released that have been fixed and ironed out. 
---
I absolutely love Ark and have played an embarrassing amount of hours into it.  They did have problems but again let's not lie and say they're comparable when thet only thing they have in common is that they make games. WC doesn't have anywhere near the resources or manpower that Bethesda enjoys.  
---
Its simply not ok for it to be accepted by the gaming community that "Bethesda games always have bugs that's their thing".  Its simply not ok for every single Bethesda release to be a big ridden mess.
---
You sure you weren't duping? I looked at your posts and you put a post up about xp exploiting
---
Was this only just added? I was online a half hour ago to check my account and didn‚Äôt see this.
---
If it was it could signify that the duping fix that‚Äôs mentioned in the email that‚Äôll reinstate accounts that have been temp-banned is a part of tomorrow‚Äôs maintenance.
---
Don't have a mule account, don't operate as forever over-encumbered, I understand you can't keep everything you want to keep and as a result have zero fears because I've been playing it as intended when it's comes to inventory.
---
I really think if this is real, it has something to do with mule accounts because it seems like all these posts people defend their mule account too.  Maybe it's the large amount of transferring between people and their mule account that triggered this.  And/or people aren't being totally honest about what their mule account is storing.
---
Bethesda really has made mistakes every step of the way with fo76 though. I wouldnt rule out the possibility without further evidence. 
---
Look at that. That's just a terrible excuse on the face of it.
---
says the guy literally trying to grammar nazi someone on fucking reddit of all places LOL. 
---
good luck out in the real world, champ. you seem like you may need it 
---
Uh, Happy [Mothman](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/330511405264535552/547194156963987457/unknown.png) Monday I guess. 
---
Once you've claimed a workshop anyone at any time can do full damage to you _or a member of your team_ without the initial 'slap damage' mechanic until the workshop is no longer owned or you switch servers. Whether or not you die is up to you.
---
I crafted 407k round of .50 cal in a 40 day cycle. Tomorrow i do another session and make around 70k, but im not sure i should now.
---
My id is: frogow lemme finish doing this thing really quickly
---
You broke the ToS. You should have been thinking about that. 
---
Yes. Every Monday!
---
yes 100% never have duped, if you watch the video of that xp farm, you literally spend a lot of junk to respawn a vertibot at the munitions factory, hardly an exploit
---
I bet he is about as honest as Jussie
---
This 'Bug' is rather annoying.  I have lost so many Legendary Weapons/Armor due to them not showing up in my Inventory if I have a weapon containing the same Enchantment. 
---
I've had a 2* Vampire's Bowie Knife (Vampire's &amp; +40% Speed) and picked up more of them, they do the annoying display thing, so I know I have them, but they never show up, which makes giving them to your team almost impossible.  
---
Also, I have gotten, for example, an Instigating Minigun from a drop.  It is 2* in the Pickup screen.  I go to actually use it, it is now a Junkies Minigun...  I was happy as a clam to get a 2* Troubleshooter's Combat Rifle, This time it replaced my Prime Two-Shot Combat Rifle...  That pissed me off...
---
Lolz again with the self deluded and sense of over entitlement.
---
You sound like a duper trying to avoid his  incoming sense of reckoning by trying to diminish his guilty act.
---
I suspect you‚Äôll get the Bethesda email as well.  Lolz
---
Till that happy moment comes, guess I‚Äôll just to ban your crybaby butt..
---
I‚Äôm sad your write ups on here helped me out so much 
---
+1 for warframe. I haven't played it for so long and just loaded into it again... I'm impressed with how much it evolved since my last play.
---
How else am I to assert dominance?
---
Guess you gotta wait it out, atleast its not a perm ban
---
&gt;  I had a 2 star expoding but killed myself too many times...lol.
---
Yea, this is why I stopped using explosive on my guns as well.  It's great a long range but close up it's just a "shoot to kill self" button. 
---
ya, I don't get into trouble very often; also, lawyer prices are heavily dependent on location, so keep trying. 
---
I mean, it says "one or more rare in game items". You could have duped a total of 100,000 items. Also, you didn't refute being a duper. You just disputed the having 100k of one item.  Bethesda does a lot of things wrong, but tracking people based on what items they've had in game is not difficult. They don't ban people for no reason and  code history doesnt lie.
---
according to some people this is a good thing, you get the entire server to yourself , game has been dead for a while
---
A couple of things I‚Äôd try:
---
First, verify all of your game files through the client option. If you‚Äôre still having the problem, remove all mods you‚Äôre using from NexusMods or wherever you downloaded them from. If you‚Äôre not using mods and/or still having the issue, try doing a full uninstall and clean reinstall of the game. Make sure all folders and files from the original installation are completely gone. Also, great time to make sure your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Hopefully, one of those will fix your issue.
---
Relax, this guy doesn‚Äôt own Bethesda, he‚Äôs trying to right their wrong, cut the employee some slack
---
You had the ToS from the first day and decided to break it. It is your fault. 
---
Farming brah. Just mix with purified water and poof veggie starch- junk starch- get adhesive.
---
Some of the dupers using HR math to rationalize their behavior.  100,000 isn‚Äôt 100.   Those 25,000 nuka colas you ‚Äúpurchased?‚Äù Or 10,000 TSEs you found under the train station seat cushions? Yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure that didn‚Äôt happen through farming or grinding or normal gameplay.  If it walks and talks like a duck, it ain‚Äôt a catfish.  But you might be trying to catfish.
---
Clearly you don‚Äôt read. If you had you‚Äôd have seen the Bethesda email.
---
But hey duper he won‚Äôt be alone..üò≥
---
New drinking game:
---
Everytime there is a condescending remark made about possible innocent players getting banned then take a shot!  
---
I think you are fine.... damn I wish I found that bag.....haha
---
ammo isnt a rare item. nor is 20000 a higher number than 100000.
---
Duping has been in every MMO Ive ever played as well, I guess that means its okay?  I don't see your point.
---
Didn't mean to rub salt in the wound.  My bad.
---
You say that, just like all your other claims, as though you know. You do not.
---
Ha! Exactly! I have a 1 Star quad capacity combat that works great... or I should say had since the ban manner got me...
---
I was trying to help you, actually. But you seem incredibly resistant to learning and super angry that you're wrong. Like, it's fine. Just say 'thanks for the info!' and move on. 
---
You don't need to get enraged about everything.
---
Just want to say I love the design of your mut-a-shop.
---
Holy shit. This is news to me.
---
So many good waste landers out there. 
---
Pretty much this. Maybe in a few years things will be worked out
---
sure. you just picked the drugs up off the street. didn't know cocaine was illegal. Sure
---
Same problem here. Should I submit a ticket as well? Or is this just fire control on customer services' part to address the loudest complaint?
---
Well maybe you're totally faking it? Since this sub sucks dev-dick harder than Slaaneshi daemon.
---
And yet miraculously YOUR version is the one true word passed down by god.  Get over yourself
---
You should put more points to your Luck stat.
---
At a minimum, the criteria used for banning seems a lot broader than what was stated in emails people have shown.
---
Support your oppressed duping brethren! Stop playing the game and send a message to Bethesda that they‚Äôre WRONG!
---
No seriously lolz
---
No doubt....lol
---
Its an online mmo people will put hundreds or thousands of hours into these game. I personally have 600+ into FO76.
---
no anger here. and I dont need your help, I used to tutor kids back when i was in college. I just dont put effort into typing on fucking *reddit* lolol. 
---
you should probably calm down, look at your life, and realize you are literally trying to upset someone over the internet by calling them "enraged" and "angry", when clearly they arent. thats trolling 101 dude. 
---
And it never occured to you beth might be wrong? Their never 100% on the spot with their bans. 
---
juichead made a video about it too, im well and truly not the only one affected like this, theres heaps of people on reddit posting about it
---
hope its not a perma ban, i genuinely enjoy playing the game 
---
This had me in hysterics, thank you :) 
---
If a large portion of your circle got banned that's interesting because that isn't random
---
He wasn‚Äôt in PA. As I said I don‚Äôt really know how it works, I only caught wind of it when I was posting PvP videos on Facebook and people told me about it (this was about the day after the TSE nerf happened. At first I said the exact same thing. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt sound like a glitch or exploit to me‚Äù until someone told me to join their game and bring 3 friends so I did. He took all his armor off (except for a couple pieces) and told us to attack him once he punches us. Once that happen we start unloading everything on him, his health bar would go down then all the way back up again. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs just the perk card doing it but something that broken can‚Äôt be in survival. Even sentinel, dodgy, and serendipity have weaknesses but this ones only weakness is if you run out of stims 
---
Okay.
---
I've been busying playing Total War: Warhammer 2. 
---
Powned 
---
I‚Äôm good, I submitted my ticket like others. I have nothing to hide and knowing tech they can literally see everything. 
---
I admit I pick up everything I find in bags and either use it like aluminum or sell it but I haven‚Äôt found that much and certainly not 100,000 rare items...lol
---
I think their sweep net got a lot of people that didn‚Äôt do anything. 
---
Have you bought/picked lots of really good items, or a massive influx of a certain item?
---
Tbh had I not read the things on this sub I wouldn't have noticed anything different.
---
How was my brother suspended and he hasn‚Äôt played since December? For steel he farmed..
---
I. doesn't.  fucking.  matter.
---
Bethesda does not give a shit about WHAT was duped at this point, they're punishing people based on HOW MUCH they duped.  An Idiot with 100,000 Nuka cola is in the same boat as an idiot that with 50,000 bobbleheads and 50,000 magazines.
---
Due to a bug, Deathclaws count as robots.... and your legendary effects get tripled while suffering from Swamp Itch /s
---
Alright I added you
---
I'll have to look to see if I'm eligible to still get it.
---
I've been thinking of building a boxed diorama (I think that's what it's called?) for the figurines that came with it. Possibly cut out a hole for the anthology nuke to sit inside, and a mount for the helmet on top.
---
Separate PvP and PvE servers are reportedly in the works
---
Lolz the hits keep coming. It‚Äôs like a comedy of errors.
---
Hey duper cya..
---
I aim to please! Lol
---
What?
---
I‚Äôm gutted on this one, please update us all at your convenience. 
---
like i said in the post i have a lot of tse weapons i think this might have unintentionally triggered their system, but no i dont have much ammo or junk or aid as it takes up too much space that i save for my weapon collection 
---
sure does have a lot of final nails. i remember people claiming when the dupping was happening that spelt the end...
---
caps dosn't count I acquired 3-400k in the last 30days 
---
That's if what the person is saying is true. Too many people on this subreddit come out crying crocodile tears about being banned.
---
i haven't logged in since a week after launch
---
Nothing official has been said connecting the two, but everyone who has claimed to follow up on getting that code (by opening a support ticket) has received an email saying they're temporarily banned for having acquired at least 100,000 of one or more rare items over a 30 day period.
---
The authentication error itself is what you get when your client is unable to connect to the servers. I'm fairly certain I've seen it myself when trying to log in when the servers were down for a patch. The ban is why they can't connect, since the servers are currently up.
---
That may be it
---
&gt; People didn‚Äôt bother to read about how much he really plays and why
---
So your point is invalid because you didn‚Äôt bother to comprehend the information being discussed.
---
If you are on a team with others and don't tag, you still get loot if anyone on the team tagged and you were close enough. You'll miss the XP still. So, team up.
---
I found over 50,000 nuka colas once, and I wasn‚Äôt banned. I think there are a lot of people who are lying or duped once or twice. 
---
But I think you‚Äôre safe. 
---
I have been trying to explain this to someone RAGE replying to me for almost an hour.  Bethesda has already wiped people's inventories, they don't care WHAT was duped at this point.  They've moved on to punishing people based on HOW MUCH they've duped.  The idiot with 100,000 Nuka Cola is in the same boat as the idiot with 50,000 bobbleheads and 50,000 magazines.
---
I farm and grind and craft a lot.  With full ammosmith and chemist and super duper perks.  No fucking way you are crafting 10,000 shells a day or 5000 stimpaks. 
---
Alright, thanks for the information.
---
De/Recompiling the scripts is not as simple as opening the ESM in XEdit, and not all the functions in the engine are decode as of yet, many "unknown" variables.  
---
And personally I suck at papyrus scripting, can make the ESM and nifs my plaything (FO4) but scripting is a language apart from the rest.
---
Upvote for visibility. I hope things get solved for you quickly. 
---
Bump ! Oh yeah. 
---
His brothers uncle nephew, 2nd aunt twice removed, gave it to him, legitimately..üò≥
---
well, that's kinda what lead up to this, so...
---
I thought there is going to be a Survival mode with no restrictions on PvP and Adventure mode. 
---
Adventure mode is what the game is now. It will still have the PvP system that's in place. 
---
No way. 100,000 xp is easy to get over 30 days.
---
The dupers are HATING! Upvoting 
---
Agreed! That‚Äôs why the email seems way off to say a person had 100,000 rare items. Ammo and stimpaks are rare... 
---
Are you seriously and unironically comparing duping to bank alts? Am I being meme'd on right now?
---
I was hesitant when 76 was released, and after lurking in this forum for a bit, I think I‚Äôll continue to pass on it. Bethesda seems to have really stepped in it on this one.
---
Likely a lie, bgs went over what the rare items were considered and the chances of you getting over 100k of ANY of them legitimately seems nigh impossible if not just plain impossible the most likely one would be if you did something stupid like traded for tons duped nuka cola and when you traded them to an alt you got flagged for it.
---
I've seen naked guys out one-hitting people in pacifist mode. So I know these kinds of combos, glitches, exploits, or hacks exists. I just have no idea what they are. Maybe someday someone will share the knowledge.
---
If I somehow get tagged due to their screw up I'll just stop playing. I'll also not trust in Bethesda again, so I'll stop playing their games. Not a huge loss to me, as FO76 was a gift, and there are alternatives 
---
considering their system is extremely flawed and is backfiring on regular players, what do you think?
---
Nice! What is that, like 10 seconds of firing time? Jk jk
---
I was so scared about it lol. Thanks for the reply btw.
---
This is actually a very good idea. It would actually give people more of a purpose. It would also push people into joining a team. Which is what Bethesda is trying to force upon us.
---
Considering 99.9% of the people who say I got banned for no reason on any multiplayer got banned for a reason. I will wait for actual proof they were band for doing absolutely nothing wrong.
---
They usually don‚Äôt give up those secrets but I feel the same way
---
I noticed a guy crying earlier it was unfair but his character was close to 6000 lbs lol 
---
Saw that they posted. Keep us updated on what happens :). Goodluck. 
---
Dude you can't go telling people this in public.
---
Are you sure?
---
Someone just traded with me and said my name appeared yellow and friendly, not red.
---
Would he just have to kill me??
---
Oh , didnt know about the mining bonus.
---
Looks more useful than 100 bonus of carry weight.
---
Define ‚Äúthat much?‚Äù 5000?  10000? 
---
You buy or acquire that much in a short period of time you are part of the problem 
---
Exactly
---
This was also back before they started banning people for duping. I just never purged my inventory on my mule character
---
Yes but the idea is that players who want all out PvP will play on survival servers leaving adventure servers much more peaceful
---
Still 25 lv and havent used that weapon. :)
---
if that is the problem, thats piss poor on bethesdas behalf.... they punish the players that grind to acquire top tier weapons (i should mention i only collect the weapons to showcase on youtube) 
---
Exactly what happened to me and a lot of ppl
---
I know, but we know at least some of the higher-ups in Bethesda actually might see this.
---
If he hasn't played since December why does he care?
---
Also, it's over a 30 day period, not just the last 30 days.
---
Human 
---
True (not that it doesn't make you raise an eyebrow). If one was going to guess what Bethesda was doing with this, it seems like they're trying to starve out dupers by temporarily removing people who buy or trade for the items they dupe.
---
I played since beta too and thats a lie the servers have been shit since day one, the only reason they are getting better is daily there are less and less players on each server.  I used to get a login que 2 or 3 times a day trying to play with friends, ive gotten one in 2 months now because so many people have left this game.
---
Thank you! I really appreciate it! 
---
Attention: OP is a wannabe YouTuber and is reposting his videos for more views. 
---
They really couldn't be any less reasonable than they are being..
---
Sure, sure now that you make a big stink, they want your TT and to assist you as quickly as possible because stemming the tide of terrible publicity seems to be the only form of action they can actually take... 
---
You know... They promised with Pre-Order that we were going to "Get to play the B.E.T.A." We were going to "Break it early, so they can fix it ahead of release." 
---
What they did was give us an Alpha of the fucking game and then sit there and let us help them get the game to actual BETA in time for a game launch.  Some arbitrary date that some asshole up in corporate said they would have the game done by and said "Fuck all if they don't give us that $$, YUP!"
---
I still play, I haven't stopped. Nearly level 100 and I try to keep my complaints to a minimum (But that is very fucking difficult) TBH, this is the second real time I've ventured into the realm of critiquing any aspect of this experience.
---
This experience has been BAD.  You promise our help, our input, and our teamwork will prevent another failed launch of a massively hyped up game.  In the end, it was just more hot air leading to another utterly, totally, disappointing launch.
---
Have a little fucking pride in what you do.. Do it so well that you aren't just another developer among a sea of shit developers releasing half-assed, ALPHA/BETA shit and calling it final. 
---
On PC I do the following.   
---
-Copy and Rename the Fallout76.exe and INI to Fallout76Low01.exe and .INI.    
---
-Copy and Rename the Fallout76.exe and INI to Fallout76Low02.exe and .INI. 
---
-Customize the settings for very low graphics quality on "*Low0x.exe. 
---
-Launch the *.exe's one at a time.   
---
Thanks to a helpful post from a couple months ago also made a batch file that has CPU threading assignment per *.Exe.  
---
This means each instance of the game uses a different set of CPU threads.   
---
**Disclaimer**  
---
You do need a solid GPU to make this work
---
final nail doesnt really mean the start of a chain so...
---
Its nice that you want to claim the game dead, but sorry to disappoint you it is still alive.
---
Also given that the bans are temporary, i would not be surprised if they are lifted after tomorrows patch. since stash limits are being increased it would make since to stop any remaining duppers until the patch comes out with any fixes to any dupping methods that might still exist. (but that is just my speculation)
---
Nope, the Bethesda White Knights said that Bethesda is not capable of making mistakes. I mean, just look at this game, IT JUST WORKS! /s
---
Of course you got false flagged, what do you expect from the incompetent people that manages this game.
---
But did you exploit any item duplication glitches?  Seems like a long winded response but you don't address the accusation.
---
This sub is so fickle.  They went from ‚Äòhaha stupid dupers‚Äô to ‚Äòsurely all these people must be innocent‚Äô in a week.  I didn‚Äôt dupe anything and I didn‚Äôt get banned.  If you got banned it offers some proof that you did something wrong.  Saying you didn‚Äôt is not proof to the contrary.  
---
1. It's not about what you had on you at the time of the ban. It's about what you had on you or have done since you opened the account. Getting rid of or not having anything duped on you anymore doesn't make you safe.
---
2. [They said](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/323527/regarding-this-account-is-not-authorized-4-8-2000-messages-on-login?language%5B%5D=en) the bans are temporary until they work out how to remove the dupe bugs fully, then your account will be reinstated *unless* you keep duping. Here's the line from their post:
---
&gt;Those who have been suspended this way were identified as having acquired over 100,000 of one or more rare in-game items within 30 days of play through duplication exploits. These accounts have been suspended from Fallout 76 until this issue is fixed in a future patch. Once a fix is live, we will reactivate these accounts and notify the owners that they can access the game again, but any further violations of the Terms of Service or Code of Conduct will result in a permanent account closure.
---
There is no line you can call but you can [submit a ticket](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident). Considering you *did* dupe the result will most likely be them telling you what I just said, though.
---
No, I'm saying that you know nothing but are spreading things as fact and that's a real problem. In other threads you call everyone banned a cheater. You either want to kiss Todd's feet or you just like spreading things you don't know to kick up drama. 
---
Either way you're the one making the claims I just proved why you're a liar, that's all. Have a nice day sped.
---
Maybe your earlier farming post was a carefully constructed disguise, maybe you knew this ban was coming and you tried to cover up your accounts involvement. 
---
It reminded me of the missile glitch in mass effect multiplayer: AFAIK any time they patched, the glitches come back with another method. 
---
Heres a link to Juiceheads video about the issue
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5XjFyJ9Oso 
---
Heres a link to another redditor posting about the issue https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as0aea/banned_im_the_900_hours_played_guy/Ôªø
---
youre wrong, im trying to get my account unbanned, wanker
---
\&gt;did my "part" in helping to report people duping.
---
But did you report... yourself?
---
Nice idea. But griefers will still do what they are doing now to kill unsuspecting players. 
---
Understand that griefers always gonna grief though. 
---
A wizard? I'm interested in hearing about that mod. 
---
What would be even cooler is if someone came up with a Psyker mod that was tied to finding and using FEV.
---
not announced on the twitter. huh
---
Everytime I consider getting and playing this game I see a post like this. How Bethesda expect me to put time and money into their game when things like that happen?
---
ya youre a wimp youll just delete it and move on
---
It's not the same Flash that is all over the web, it's most likely something like Scaleform, which implements the Flash API in a way that uses the graphics hardware in the computer running the game.
---
While Scaleform has its own set of bugs, it's not as bad as the web version of Flash. =D
---
Fair points.
---
It's fairly common knowledge
---
Scorched are scorched humanoids, robots are all machines, mutants apply to all super mutant variants, ghouls are ghouls, and animals are all non sentient creatures. That said, I don‚Äôt know what affects most of the cryptids. Wendigos appear with ghouls, snallygasters are supposedly fev mutants, the Flatwoods monster might count as a robot, moth man is a animal, and I believe the grafton monster counts as a fev mutant.
---
Or.... you know, instead of it being a giant conspiracy.... maybe the guy who got banned for duping actually \*GASP\* was a duper!  
---
Shocking, I know. 
---
A friend of mine is a software engineer and he likes to build his own bots and hacking tools.  The guy had years invested into games like WoW and BDO, and he spent almost all of it cheating. 
---
Some people play games because they have fun playing games.  Some people play games because they have fun cheating in games.  The amount of time played has nothing to do with it other than they were able to get away with doing it for that long.  
---
Disclaimer at this point; I‚Äôm not saying anything about the OP, I don‚Äôt care to be honest.
---
However, my friend was a community type individual.  If he got caught cheating he would have put up a post exactly like the OP.  He wrote guides, walkthroughs, he would spend a lot of money in games.  He would use these things in petitions to the developers as evidence that he wasn‚Äôt cheating.  Because why would he?  Look how much money he spent, how much time he invested, and how much work he did for the community.  
---
Again, I‚Äôm not saying anything in regard to the OP.  I‚Äôm just saying that when I read posts like this I think of my friend, because he‚Äôs written the same posts before. 
---
Why would you tell the entire world this?
---
Wait never mind I get it. Username checks out
---
You can learn the plans now after the last patch.
---
Did you try to cold reboot your machine? Sometimes this can clear up random glitches (if the power supply has not powered off in a while it can become unstable). I don't know if it will help, but it may be worth a try.
---
Believe it when I see it.
---
HAHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH  
---
Karma's a bitch bruh.
---
You can still earn the plans and find pieces in drops during SBQ event.
---
What if it's not legendary, do you still want it? Come to think of it, it's not a rolling pin either; it's a spatula. Let me know if you're interested. (Xbox)
---
Such is life. But hopefully they keep their grief reserved to the survival servers, so that We can dick around with our friends in peace
---
Take the Gorge Junkyard workshop. It has a concrete resource collector available there. 
---
I haven't played in 6 weeks.
---
I only keep it on my xbox in Hope's that mods will be a thing soon. 
---
I will remove it when I need the space for something else.
---
haha, thanks for the laugh, I needed that
---
Skyrim is such a crap game
---
at least you can go to the computer and get the plans to make it over. if you completed the quest to get the excavator armor without reading the computer you can never make it.
---
it was just a joke bro, chill
---
but if you want to get serious, I probably have around 1000 hours of gameplay as well and the playercount is steadily declining. it kinda stabilized the last couple weeks but it's still pretty low based on server rotation.
---
I haven't touched GW2 or FFXIV in over a year. I still check the subreddits to see what's popping. Same with OSRS because they have good memes.
---
You‚Äôre a legend
---
Warframe is a deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep dive
---
I am a goodie 2 shoes and have never exploited. Don't even know how to, nor want to. 
---
I didn't know at the time because I was relatively new to the game and someone gave me a weapon with a heap of ammo. I suspect this was duped so I haven't even used it. It is still in my inventory though. 
---
Should I dump it? 
---
I dont care a whit whether anyone duped. Bethesfa is at fault for this mess.
---
Sounds like "Please get our payment processor dropped due to high chargeback volume" to me lol
---
"Surely the guy who got banned is an upstanding individual who couldn't possibly be lying, right? Surely he provided some proof of his claims, before we took his side against the developers, right?  
---
Not good enough, Reddit. This isn't some tiny website, you have the resources."
---
The ammo factory spawns a T-51b right leg often when I‚Äôm there. I only noticed it because someone was saying how they could never find that one piece!
---
I hate to admit, but you're right. I actually brave about not having mule character 90% of players I know do.
---
Fyi easy to collect legit 6000lbs of items before the weight restriction patch.
---
The bans aren't temporary... Duping did spell the end for this game... The game is very, very nearly dead... Bethesda has had too many chances and they've lost all credibility.
---
Hello, welcome to the internet. This must be your first game. Allow me to introduce you to the concept of a community manager.
---
Sorry you're dealing with this issue as well. Please post details if you receive any from Bethesda, as there are a lot of people on this sub who want to get to the bottom of this. Good luck.
---
A lot of innocent players were banned, accused for duping. Myself included.
---
Lucky you; I got the swamp itch
---
   Social acceptance of an exploit does not change the definition of exploit.  Please reread my original comment, if you still don't understand I can't help you.
---
you think this OP.. in this post right here.. with well documented account of virtually every detail of his activities since the game launched.   You think this OP Right here, the one where the help desk asked for his TT # so they could expedite helping him...  You think this guy who lives/breaths/blogs this game...  You think THIS OP, who came here and made a very clear and well thought out, well detailed, and well backed up claim about his account... Is duping? 
---
That is a WHOLE FUCKING LOT to go through to convince somebody you're not duping..   I think the evidence of this player NOT BEING A DUPER is pretty clean cut if you really stop and *READ* the details.
---
Just curious, where do you get your numbers? not saying numbers are high or that a decline isnt happening, but I see a lot of talk about player count for a game that doesnt release those stats.
---
Not at all, but it's funny when people say they have never duped, but post that they have lots of legendaries to trade.
---
I'm gonna go with, "It's more likely that cheaters are also liars."   
---
Like a normal person with some common fucking sense.
---
Awesome, thank you for the info!
---
The more I read this sub, the happier I am that I simply no longer touch Bethesda products. They've been making the exact same game since Morrowind, just worse each time. 
---
Bethesda doesn't deserve your money, play something else.
---
He needs the leather right leg
---
The more I read posts from this sub, I'm glad to have never purchased the game and seemingly accompanying shit show.
---
Wasnt this put out like... last thursday?
---
Sounds like you are full of shit.
---
Downvotes are for comments that don't contribute to the discussion. Your original comment contributed nothing, and your edit set that back even further.
---
Morbid curiosity. Plus at the end of the day it's Fallout; I did actually want to see if the game was worth the purchase, and it's just become a habit now.
---
I would say reasonably rare. One time I had it all locked up tight. Somebody appeared inside. WTF? They must have logged out there on another server. They did the money emote and wanted to trade. Nah. You're not getting to see what I've got. I jumped up on the walk way looking down on the console aiming waiting for him to press the button, and when he did took him out. That's the only time I have had pvp contest at the workshop when I have claimed it. And I have claimed it a bunch of times.
---
You get lucky occasionally. I usually take it unowned and hold it to pvp rather than take it from someone tho lol. Barricade tf out of it it makes it very discouraging for them
---
Maybe they used to hunt the dupers and took their loot (and got flagged by the server as a cheater) I don't know if this is a false positive ban or not. If you take the stolen/illegal stuffs does that make you a thief too?
---
You got the combat armor?
---
It's the fucking Catalina Wine Mixer!
---
Mule accounts may be common, but if this guy here has accumulated an excessive amount items legendary or regular items and they total 100k, then the ban is legit. He doesn't have to have 100k on his main player right now, just has to have had 100k items touch his account over his "900 hours".   
---
This is common with dupers. He admitted that he has 3 accounts that he uses, 1 main and 2 mules. Really sounds like he was transferring enough items between the other 2 accounts to get flagged. 
---
You could have crafted some sweet douche rinse for the guy with chemist perk! 
---
400 hours on the game, got banned for being high level since everything I got in game I worked my ass off to get the money for by batering. Thanks Jewestheda.
---
Haha thanks for the info, but I think I should had put an /s
---
You should read the [patch notes](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2J2ong0O2B6GAI1AeIdGcp/fallout-76-patch-notes-january-29-2019).  
---
But seriously nothing special yet, we are on the wait for an update this week, and content update start rolling after.
---
How is it a "grievance" to air, if you admit that you made a mistake and were wrong for what you did?  
---
You're not an "innocent" player. You don't have anything to "vent" about, other than getting caught. Man the fuck up.
---
...Yes it does. Under nearly every game int he history of online games.
---
Did you do any "duper hunting", tracking down dupers to kill them, take their scrap, and dump it? Cause with how they've worded their post it's possible that could trigger their dupe detector.
---
&gt; Don‚Äôt buy items that r duped.
---
Is there a "check if this is duped" button in the game?
---
No?
---
I think I found a flaw in your plan.
---
Just stop supporting Bethesda. They make bad games.
---
I'm sorry but what you're saying doesn't relate to anything I asked about, from what I can discern 
---
Because cheaters, hackers, and exploiters also tend to be liars, and that's basic common sense? 
---
I'd say being able to differentiate your different Power Armors in terms more descriptive than "Power Armor Chassis" would easily be in my Top 5 list of things that needed to be fixed yesterday.
---
My question is was the problem that you got over 100k of a rare item that was a consumable that added up to 100k over time and was constantly being used so it didnt seem like you had that much?
---
again id like to reiterate. there are other people like me who are getting banned, and there are people who are known dupers that still havent been touched, what does that show?
---
Check under the challenges area and you'll see how many hours/7600 you've played
---
It‚Äôs so goddamn logical, or illogical depending on your perspective.
---
Or as I likes to say ‚Äúyou are either on to something or on something‚Äù 
---
&gt;with well documented account of virtually every detail of his activities since the game launched.
---
LOL, no.  I read through the whole thing, and his original post. Not a shred of any actual proof. Stop crying, do some fucking reading, come back and open your eyes.
---
Dude mega rip
---
They flipped wrong switch and banned everyone using "Super Duper" perk card.
---
Used to work in customer service years ago and I wish more people did this. That way a supervisor would have to call the person back. I hated my supervisors and loved escalating angry people to them. 
---
That sounds lame AF. Sich a shame they shat on this game the way they did
---
Do your 3 characters just stack on top of each other? Move and shoot synchronously?
---
Don't forget disease cure for the burn
---
unfortunately I haven't record those 1000 hours so I can't back my claims. but me, personally, I base it off server rotation (which I do **a lot** of), total players in the map (because you can only be sneaking for so long) and nowadays, just names. back then my recently met list would get so long I could barely recognize anyone. nowadays I can pick out specific names based on their favorite hour to play.
---
and we do have *some* data thanks to that PS4 leak... thing. sales weren't that great to begin with.
---
Have you like... never played an online game before? Every single one of them bans you for exploiting glitches.
---
Well the weight bonus is to help you carry all that ore. it was made for mining rocks after all. Lol but seriously run through lucky hole mine with that suit and come away with 700+ lead scrap after smelting. It's something everyone should have IMO.
---
Cool thanks :) maybe I‚Äôll just play a little to refresh my mind on my build and stuff and wait for more content to really dive in!
---
No it clearly says they will unlock the accounts. 
---
Got this message this morning as well. I was just online last night. I think Bethesda‚Äôs produced another faulty set of code to ID the 100k. I have probably looted over 100k in junk and items in the last month with constant farming. Maybe patch 6 will correct this. Always been a legit player who just loves to farm. I guess we‚Äôll find out
---
Using a bank alt isnt an exploit man. Its not even close. Gear piles up and bagspace is finite, how would having a bank alt to offload your misc shit even be in the same ballpark as a duping glitch to you?
---
&gt; After people lying and trying to spread hysteria about the alleged "steal items while trading" exploit that didn't exist
---
You mean the one that was explicitly noted in the patch notes? That one?
---
The more I read, the better I feel about never having purchased it in the first place.
---
I would suggest getting mutations ASAP, they really add value to the gameplay.
---
It should be temp
---
How the absolute fuck are people still playing this shit show of a game?
---
I‚Äôm not blaming them, just asking if they know how this has been allowed to happen. I don‚Äôt have contact with anyone else at Bethesda. Was simply asking. 
---
No were even close like scrap you see that someone drops but I wait until they come back... if they don‚Äôt after a while and it was still there I did. 
---
Most I found was like 60-70 frag grenades and a dozen missiles. 
---
I see some that have found like 20k of something... sorry but even a player like me knows that‚Äôs a copy of something and not touching it. 
---
My character weighs about 230 maybe and my stash isn‚Äôt even full. I have two 1 Star weapons and not the exploding type either. So I don‚Äôt get it. 
---
Yes, attacking the underpaid CS worker right off the bat is a great way to get your ticket put on the back burner until someone feels good and ready to answer. They don't give a shit, and you're already angry.
---
I guess we gleaned different information from what we read... 
---
What lvl are you, OP?
---
That's a terrible experience. I've never had any thing like that happen before
---
Bots are definitely not perfect and Bethesda does give opportunity to appeal. Issue is not that they only help the ones gaining traction on media, but that their support staff is backlogged to hell. Of course, some/most of that is at their fault for releasing a game prematurely, but some/most is from individuals that are guilty but try to play it off or people complaining about problems that don't exist.
---
The development teams, support teams, and the community managers are not at fault for any of this. If anything, the before mentioned people are the ones most disappointed as this game was their project that corporate rushed them on. 
---
Corporate and production are the problem.
---
Sorry looks like it was meant for another post reply, sorry about that, bad eyes and small character...lol
---
It's an online game, there will always be assholes like this.  Especially when the end game content is so limited.  When this happens, just find another server.
---
Hopefully you can get your ban reviewed. However, I hear an awful lot of "I never participated in anything to do with duping!" Well....except for this one, teensy little time...and my friend only gave me ONE duped item...". It would seem Bethesda's detection system is working. I admit that, all facts you give here being totally accurate, you were pretty border-line in the "was it cheating" department. I personally wouldn't have picked up anything off those dupers, either. Not wise. I would have just reported them. The dev's detection system is going to have recorded you picking up a bunch of dropped duped items, and that's how dupers transfer items to different accounts. It probably flagged your account, and you looked like a mule. Two good things: 
---
1. You can probably get un-banned if your account gets reviewed in more detail.
---
2. This is probably REALLY going to discourage people from having anything to do with cheaters or duped items in the future. 
---
I don't think he means it doesn't affect them - it's just that the strength of the attack is nerfed by the effects of Sent/Cav/Assassin.  That's a damage reduction that is separate from armor.
---
I hear where you‚Äôre coming from. At this point the community needs to know what happened in this particular case, one way or another.
---
Secondly, Bethesda needs to know that their non-transparent, no-proof banning bullshit can result in thousands of their most vocal users being pissed the hell off.
---
Maybe its time to buy a new account ? :/
---
Wow Bethesda being ballsy doubling down trying to make their image look worse... Lmao this game has been a shit show for them and it just keeps getting better and better while I'm watching from a distance. 
---
So there is no chance that players with 900 hours played, who has mules, also have duped for a bit or massively? Just because they make some nice informative posts.
---
I hope you are not a duper and get your acc back but these posts tell me nothing about what you have not done. Just your words here.
---
Well i wish you all the best if the ban was uncalled for.
---
Just got to 50 I still don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing 
---
Downvoters are pieces of human filth, and I use the word human reluctantly. If you think that it is okay to steal someone's hard-earned internet points because you may disagree with them trying to help then you deserve to be shot into space like my original edit says. What you've said has done nothing to convince me otherwise and, perhaps, has pushed me further into my belief that idiots who downvote don't know what their own time is worth. Downvotes and downvoters are like whistles on trains, all they do is blow and they are also extremely annoying. If you are one of the cynical elitists that downvoted my comment then I hope you get Dengue Fever because you are already a sick puppy but then you would at least have an excuse. Have a nice day.
---
I‚Äôve got a lvl 50 set fully repaired no mods. Lvl 188 never even used it. 2.5k if you want it. 
---
His mom helped me to get the achievement "Acquire different kind of disease 0/22" in a single night. I didn't have any caps on me so I paid her with spoiled meat.
---
I was just making a joke.
---
I would be happy to help too, if fr0g can't.
---
Ah. Well either way AA is the best thing I have found to use against those armor set lol 
---
The proof is in their history, the time they‚Äôve put into this game. If you think that a person like that would cheat/exploit, I‚Äôve got a house to sell you. Not to mention brazenly posting it on Reddit. If ever there was doubt about their ban, and it comes out that they were indeed cheating after this post, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd be blacklisted. There is literally *no point* for OP to lie here. Either they‚Äôre telling the truth, and get their account back, or they‚Äôre lying and stay banned. Would‚Äôve been a waste of time if they were lying. 
---
Just leave the server no need to let them continue to bully you
---
I will keep you updated, the website was down earlier in the day when I received the email, and I still can't submit a help ticket for fallout 76, but I've sent an email to bethesda
---
I'll take any other suggestions of what to do, but it looks like a lot of people were wrongfully suspended, it doesn't make bethesda look good, and that makes me sad, I want them to succeed
---
Thanks for the clarity.
---
I had responded to a few authentication error posts directly related to 4:8:2000.
---
Have to manually move and shoot each, unless I had 2 pcs "they have to take turns"
---
Sounds like a bunch of nonsense.  Odds of your low level char even having 1800 caps is low.  If it was a good mod he was probably giving you a good deal and you took offense lol.  That is not a way people scam others in this game.  "Report him" lol gtfo. 
---
So to only get bethesda's attention is to get 3000+ upvotes.
---
Or maybe just fix this shitty game in the first place and this won‚Äôt happen? I‚Äôm no game developer but I‚Äôm just sayin. 
---
How much for marsupial
---
Honsetly this sub has turned itself around from the mostly cult it used to be. People are voicing their complaints and not bein shut down immediately. You want the dumpster fire, go to the filthy casuals sub.
---
250 caps
---
With an AA minigun and Stabilized, a target is reduced to 27.5% armor. If your armor rating is normally ~300, you are now at 82.5 armor rating. A level 45 minigun does 14 damage, 26 with 9/9 heavy weapon and 3/3 bloody mess. It sounds like he wasn‚Äôt running an low health damage build if he didn‚Äôt start at low health, so we‚Äôll assume no significant boosts from Adrenal reaction. 
---
Ignoring situational things like Adrenaline, or buffs (some chems boost damage by 25%, and that can be stacked with 20% from HW bobblehead), you‚Äôre looking at 82.5 armor vs ~26 damage. 
---
With the fallout4 damage formula, if I‚Äôm doing my math right, you‚Äôre looking at 8.5 damage damage hitting your health. Now, I don‚Äôt know the exactly RoF (in seconds) of the minigun, but it fires fast. Really fast. Maybe 10/second? If that‚Äôs the case, and your attacker is up close so every bullet is hitting, he‚Äôs doing 85 damage a second. Average character probably has around 300 health, give or take. So 3 seconds of fire would take you down to 45 health. Another half second would kill you. 
---
So yeah, it‚Äôs realistic with a minigun.
---
I got banned.  Did i deserve it?  Probably.  Did i dupe? No.  I did pick up lots of dupe items from friends.  So i am guilty of having lots of items.  Only thing i had alot of was candy, about 800k.  I feel sorry for the innocent ppl on here who dont deserve it though for making lots of ammo.
---
They do an item scan of your inventory, it has nothing to do with people reporting you. You obviously cheated and are trying to lie about it. Accept your punishment and grow up
---
Yeah some people are horrible.  I've been there with high levels picking on you. But don't worry, rise up in the ranks and everyone is equal in the top. I'm 72 and I can kill 200s that mess with me. 
---
Same thing happened to in that exact spot earlier today. 
---
What's the southwestish of Abbie's bunker? Same shit happened to me lol.
---
Yes, I have a forehead and neck tattoo I wear at the same time :)
---
I can do that 
---
That's a difficult scenario, maybe they traded for them in game.  They cant track individual items so duplicates look the same, for example I have 4 identical instigating grognaks axe, but I didnt dupe any of them.  So if they banned me or even took away my duplicates (I havent checked yet if they did) I would be pissed as I obtained them legit on my own.
---
They failed to design the game in a way to allow proper monitoring of its systems, it's one of the major issues, they cant track stuff properly so they are making lots of potential mistakes with these bans.
---
You must have had herd mentality with class freak or the one that boosts mutations in a group.   Having non-whole numbers for your S.P.E.C.I.A.L  fucks up a lot of the calculations. 
---
The two most noteable things it will mess with your carry weight and give you "unlimited sprinting"
---
right so the emails a few people posted that said the ban would be lifted when the issue is resolved really meant the ban is permanent. good to know that "will be lifted" means "will never be lifted."
---
and sorry to be the barer of good news but the game is not close to death yet.
---
My Maine account got banned though lol... One time I stole a dupers bag that had 400k nuka colas in it.. Must have been that
---
Ultracite sucks, don't bother. T51b or X01 is what you want.
---
T51b has the best stats. X01 is comparable, "good enough" when overrepaired, and you'll definitely need it for nuke zones.
---
Nuclearspank. Join my game 
---
All bans are legit. People are just crybabies! Don‚Äôt pick up dupe items if you don‚Äôt wanna get banned! 
---
You recently posted a PSA how to delete items with specifics to the duping issue. I'm assuming you were duper hunting and deleting thier items? I'd rather assume the best instead of the worst at this point as I'm questioning the legitamacy of some of these bans. I'm slowly changing my outlook on some of these 4:8:2K's 
---
Were you duper hunting and destroying their goods? Because that would explain your ban even if it was briefly you still had excessive qty's of duped items. That or you were destroying your evidence but I doubt that as you seem like a stand up honest fella who would never dupe and has never duped. Nor would you have a need to do that.
---
how does that even end up there
---
Many, many people keep getting banned. You have to watch the amount of times and items you transfer between characters. If many, many people keep a ton of items between other accounts, it is easy to flood the economy and ruin it for others. Play the game as intended, don't try to play "keep all".    
---
Pretty sure Bethesda has a way to keep track of each account you transfer items to. You hit x number, it gets fishy, then they really start watching your activity. Hit x number of items between all accounts, banned. 
---
Doubt. 
---
They did not hunt you across servers. This is fan fiction 
---
So, first of all, they've said a roadmap should be available by the end of the month.
---
Second, you have your time table mixed up.  Fallout 4 didn't get a DLC roadmap until around this point in its life cycle (February), and its first DLC (Automatron) came the following month.  76 and 4 released within four days of each other in the month of November, so there's been nothing unusual about their rollout.  You could argue that because 76 wasn't a critical success, they should hasten their rollout, but this has been by-the-book so far.
---
Alright, heavy sigh....   
---
So its 100,000 rare items within a 30 day period based off pickup history from what I have been able to gather by Q&amp;A with banned account holders they were 100% honest with what they did or picked up and it looks like picking up a dupers bag that has a bunch of rare duped items will do it as well..   
---
Bethesda could have done this better like, look to see if someone then dropped all the stuff they picked up but it appears they just looked to see if it was picked up at all, Not in the inventory, not in the stash.... just picked up. 
---
yeah not the stats they we were talking about, but thank you anyway.
---
Not sure if you read the post, but it literally says ‚Äúno further appeals will be considered‚Äù. Doesn‚Äôt look like Bethesda gives opportunity to appeal with that wording, unless you happen to be a Redditor and get some traction here. The issue *is* that they only help the ones gaining traction on media, because I guarantee that we‚Äôve only seen a fraction of the ones who *chose* to argue it. Others may have just cut their losses and moved on.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, what? 
---
&gt;	The development teams, support teams, and the community managers are not at fault for any of this.
---
I agree that the support teams and community managers aren‚Äôt at fault, but the development teams? Who would you say is at fault here if not them? They‚Äôre the ones who allowed a bug into the game which they then decided to ban people for. If the developers had tested correctly we wouldn‚Äôt be here. 
---
You might have acquired enough stuff in you exploit/farm vids to trip detection
---
It may be temporary, but it seems like some people are being unjustly suspended. So it never should have happened to begin with for these people.
---
great, I wanted to try my new PA build. cranberry bog isn't doing it for me, spawning just 1 at a time.
---
fuck bats
---
This post made it into the top 100 on /r/all.  Some of us wander into subs where we aren't subscribed.
---
It shouldn't be but most likely... my heart goes out to him.
---
Gt? 
---
*This account has been suspended until fixed by a future patch*
---
So, a lifetime ban?
---
This is a direct result of "games as a service". Dont subscribe to this garbage model, unless you are content with such situations. You bought the game. You own it. They have no right to restrict your acess in ANY way, no matter what you do. If you are able to exploit - this just shows the developer's utter incompetence. This game is trash - play something thats worth your time.
---
This may be due to radworms giving you 150% to all buffs and debuffs
---
Upvoting for providing clarity!
---
I came back to my camp mid-quest to unload and craft, and there was a guy in a clown suit in my shack. I waved but he just pulled out an axe and started chasing me around the woods. It was nighttime so it turned into a horror film and it sucked, lol. The slap damage was draining 5-10% of my health each hit. I couldn‚Äôt outrun him so I had to abandon my quest progress and log out. 
---
Why the fuck did Bethesda think this was a good idea? 
---
Probably because some exec heard about fortnite and ordered Battle Royale style PVP to be shoved into this game, which doesn‚Äôt fit at all. 
---
What‚Äôs that mean
---
LOL they didn't that's the thing! 
---
Define exploit for me.
---
Nothing. I mean, literally, nothing. Back-of-house type stuff. Fixes here. Return of old problems there. But if you're looking for new stuff to rope you back in? Zero.
---
Thanks for the chuckle, new friend
---
Can we xpost this to r/sadcringe
---
i logged yesterday since december and i was just collection flux to sell because i spend a lot on jetpack and some mod for the legs to carry more weight but got disconnected 2 times lmao still i managed to collect like 100+ flowers but it was sad and sell everything and log out
---
u/Ladydevann recently responded to the top post asking for their ticket number (might be a good idea to submit a ticket if you haven‚Äôt already) so this seems to be under investigation, maintenance and an update is also scheduled for tomorrow so hopefully these mistaken temp-bans will be resolved with that.
---
Doesn‚Äôt proof anything! 
---
Call [here](https://imgur.com/a/w6UX7qb) and leave a message, otherwise you have almost no luck.
---
Yeah but what is affecting XP gain?
---
We can't help you here. Bethesda has been suggesting you reply to the email with your concerns. You can also submit a ticket via this link: https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10?prod=1129&amp;cat=287
---
Wtf is this double standard shit some guy post he has been wrongfully suspended but because he is on twitch everyone believes him? Where are all the witch hunters who call him a liar without actually knowing him?
---
In a serious note I‚Äôm sorry this stuff happened to you. But brace for all the people calling you out.
---
Exploiting the games systems in an unfair way. Now explain to me how using a Bank alt exploits anything.
---
They are correct you can go to fort Defiance to the 4th floor terminal and learn the plans to make the armor. 
---
This! Just take a look back on the bashing industry for this game. It has become a public sport. The trade glitch that were supposedly happening on a massive scale but were zero proof of was probably the best example. It was spammed in reddit and on youtube. People even made vedeos later trying to recreate it with no luck, nada.
---
It is possible that this many people got kicked when doing nothing wrong but i bet most if not all are rightful bans or people not even owning the game just enjoying a new shitstorm.
---
My 2 caps. Not saying it is the truth but seems most likely too me that it is all or mainly bs....
---
*speaking into shirt*
---
4:8:2000 crew, here he is.
---
&gt; Agreed.   But I think we can both be honest here and say that bethesda  has MORE performance issues than other big studios.  Or small ones for  that matter. 
---
That depends on how you measure them. Bethesda games have a lot more in them to do. You can't interact with the environment very much in GTA or RDR2.   I've not played RDR2 but something tells me you can't walk into a random house and pick up everything in the house and move it around. I know you can't do it on GTA as the NPC's are simple programs to do one action and are randomly spawned in.  Not many large open world games has that much interaction with the game world.   
---
Bethesda is also one of the few game developer at least major ones that are fully in support of the mod community and allow their games to be modded till they are completely different games. 
---
&gt; I absolutely love Ark and have played an embarrassing amount of hours  into it.  They did have problems but again let's not lie and say they're  comparable when thet only thing they have in common is that they make  games. WC doesn't have anywhere near the resources or manpower that  Bethesda enjoys. 
---
Are you talking about the company as a whole including all the individual subsidiaries that are working on their own projects? Or are you looking at just Battlecry Studios?  
---
Gamer tag. Sorry. Thanks 
---
Jesus Christ I wouldn't even pirate this game
---
Between the bugs the Shady business practices and just the shittier treatment of its customer base I'm surprised Bethesda hasn't just shut down under the weight of class action lawsuits.
---
It's always there...
---
This is me in a nutshell (cue Austin Powers clip). My CPU cooler was broken at release, and damn if it wasn't a stroke of good luck, because I likely would own a copy of this game right now if it had been working properly.
---
I just come by from time to time to see if it's a viable game yet, but every time... noooope.
---
Unacceptable for these bans to be implemented on legit players in the first place!
---
Whatever happened to your "New Fallout Movement"?
---
Or your claims that Beth. austin knew of duping and you had proof?
---
Not to mention the odd affection of calling it Bethesda Austin (always properly capital) despite random other error in spelling and such?
---
Move on troll. You already promised to several times. Yet you won't leave. 
---
in otherwords you have nothing but your personal experiance.
---
we have a snap shot of players on ps4 when that was trophy stat was announced, but has it ever been updated with new players and do you you really think ps4, xbox 1, pc sale would all be even close to the same?
---
I never claimed it was some sleeper hit, but that peoples claims of a dying game to be false. frankly by this time the boy that cried wolf should have been bitch slapped.
---
Everyone has replied to emails. Bethesda do not reply for almost 20 hours in my case!
---
Gee,the guy with 2 fallout themed toys on his right, has with no explanation, just joined the game. I bet.
---
The next patch is tomorrow. So im sure all the "innocent" people will be reinstated and right back out there in their new leather armor and machete.
---
I don‚Äôt play Fallout76 anymore..playing other games. Excited for anthem playing it right now.
---
I've had the glitch for a few months now on my main. Actually made it difficult to play my alt characters since I was used to unlimited sprinting, lol. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry that this happened to you as well. I doubt that Bethesda will take blame for their own actions and they will probably tell you to wait your ban out until ‚Äúfurther notice.‚Äù Best of luck to you.
---
you define exploit as exploiting the game systems in an unfair way?  Using the word to define the word? mmkay.  I get what your saying anyway so lets go with that definition.  Nothing is an exploit to you because nothing is unfair because everyone can exploit.  
---
Try another definition.
---
They didnt believe him because he was a him.. I'm not sexist at all, but just an obvious observation.
---
Occam's Razor.  While it is possible some innocent people got caught in the net, it is most likely the people banned did something wrong and warranted a temp ban to cool off from the game while what they were messing up is fixed.  There are many reasons why people would say they got banned but didn't do anything wrong.
---
* Associated with dupers/cheaters and shared in their wealth (yes this makes you culpable, don't kid yourself)
---
* Did something bad but in their minds it's "so trivial compared to others" that they feel they can round down and say they did nothign wrong.
---
* Know exactly what they did wrong but hope that these posts get momentum and they can ride a possible future *unbanning* wave back into the game, and will not admit they did anything wrong publicly.
---
This being said, the smartest thing to do if you ARE a duper/cheater, much like you shouldn't tell the police anything or ever admit anything, is not admit any duping or cheating.  I'm not saying this is morally good or anything like that, but just for the purpose of what action is most beneficial to a player in this situation: admit nothing.
---
Hope everything works out for everybody in the end and we can all get back to playing this fun game.
---
They have to try to claim the workshop you or your teammate have already claimed.  That should pop up an alert on your end to defend your workshop. After they do that they can fast travel to where you are and engage in PvP.
---
Next time you claim a workshop fully read that prompt that notifies you that it'll cost you 25 caps. 
---
I can‚Äôt get the Queen to drop anything other than
---
Explosive vents
---
Lolz you couldn‚Äôt care less because you‚Äôre banned or because you weren‚Äôt playing.
---
But hey look on the bright side you don‚Äôt have a reason to play,cuz you were banned.
---
I don't support this "game" at all, but that sucks. Never a pleasure seeing a dedicated gamer get the shaft, best wishes.
---
Hey I actually really love your idea! That would be awesome! 
---
The means that are being used to bypass the mechanic is trading. Trading is an intended action. It's not an exploit.  
---
Exploits are when player take advantage of a bug or unintended mechanism. If a player jumped on a specific rock 100 times and it duplicated everything in there inventory, and they did this action repetitively, that would be an exploit. Sure 'jumping' is an intended action, but jumping on a specific rock, a specific number of times for an intended effect that was not planned by the developers is an exploit. 
---
It's 2019. Mules in MMO's have been around 20+ years. Any dev that didn't know of this is incompetent. Any dev that wanted to stop it would code in limits to trading (x# of items per day) and make it clear to players in some way that they should only have one active account at a time. But no one does this because having a mules is no big deal and no dev's really care taht much, since it's not an exploit.  
---
Which one are you referring to, I could see how that might trip detection especially with the grenade bouquet one with the grenades you get in your inventory (I dropped them because over encumbered), I made that video just like all the other bigger fallout youtubers and they are unaffected by this, so i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs any of my guides that caused this
---
I duped like crazy, mainly because it was the only fun thing left in the game. I didnt even sell my duped items, I saw no point in it with all the nuka cola caps I had. I'm not banned and still have tons of duped shit.
---
Clicked expecting a nuke launch or some other form of excessive escalation (that I would have been totally fine with), found a devastation that no nuke could come close to. 
---
Ah, yes. Good idea. I protected it from creatures, but not from humans.
---
Lolz it‚Äôs affecting dupers not everyone..
---
Yep, with the number of people they're banning they are probably swamped with replies so it's going to be a while before they get to everyone :/
---
Huh?
---
There are do many flaws here but let's address the glaring one...
---
Comparing a bag of meth with a duped weapon is not an apt comparison. But...let's say it is.
---
Then I will direct you here...
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/myfox8.com/2017/01/09/man-arrested-after-deputies-mistake-kitty-litter-for-meth/amp/
---
This is an article where the trained police officers thought a bag of kitty litter was a bag of meth. It's kind of like what people are alleging here. That the weapons they have arent duped and that bethesda (the authority on duped weapons) just banned them for a legit weapon.

Kind of like getting arrested by the experts for kitty litter grade methamphetamine.
---
I find your unmitigated rage over a video game amusing.
---
Me: "At least the game can't get worse."
---
Bethesda: "Hold my beer."
---
I think the worst that will happen to you at the end of this is the deletion of you character or deletion of all gear if its duped (much harder). You probably wont be permaed
---
Considering how shit this game is. Join the party. I haven‚Äôt played in over a month. 
---
Because he didn‚Äôt Dupe or buy the steel from other people he actually farmed it up. With workshops and place in the world where he could put a the resource gather thing on the ground. He also planned to come back and play when new content came out. 
---
I would love this!
---
They let them keep more than 1 item. I have stacks of 6 of two shot exploding handmades ans 2 shot shotguns that never got deleted. 
---
Dude just quit, anyone left who is defending this game is toxic/blind and don't care what good you might have done that makes this unjustified they only care the game isnt spoken of negativity. Let us be blunt, they had a golden egg and they dropped it, bethesda fucked up. 
---
im just loving the salty tears from the dupers who are getting the ban hammer...i love how they are all claiming how they didnt do anything..
---
You openly admitted to taking duped Items off players in a previous post. Something about a lvl1 killing lvl 4's which seems impossible with pvp rules?? (I don't get it or see how it's possible)
---
You said they dropped legendaries and serums plans and what not. After which you had the balls to admit you took it and bragged you were on an alt so you had nothing to lose? You shouldn't have tempted fate buddy. You literally asked for this ban in that post.
---
Apparently the last patch or hotfix or SOMETHING tweaked her drop list. I remember that problem. I'm getting new and more varied plans from her now. You might want to go drop a nuke. ;)
---
Lol dude, if you think that cheaters don't put time into effortposts on reddit, this must be your first online game. 
---
You are lying about duping to gain internet points. Who's the real shitty person here? 
---
For Xbox I open up my gallery, hide the UI and fake screenshots with Y. Then I grab them from my captures on the app :)

Link above is to another post with same problem.
---
Why does everyone believe her but not the OP here? 
---
More attention needed to this issue..
---
And I‚Äôm not a troll. A small time streamer. I do have proof. I wanting to see if Bethesda responds. Do your research before your quick to judge.
---
I have a mule account. I‚Äôm not banned. Currently logged in with both.
---
You cant be serious right now. Give me your definition.
---
I haven‚Äôt played in months and was banned today for the same thing.  I never had 100k of anything. I don‚Äôt even care, but I find this hilarious.
---
you didn't follow the ToS that you agreed to when purchasing the game and got banned. Deal with it, cry baby. 
---
Yeah, I kind of figure it would be.
---
There was a griefer going around today harassing Lv. 30s and 40s.  He butchered a Lv. 40 and I tried to camp on his bag to protect it, but then he came after me with a Power Fist.  Did a surprising amount of damage despite my being in Pacifist mode.  Also had very little HP, so I suspect he was rolling with the exploity-and-totally-not-duped build du jour.
---
I thought about giving him a shock with my AA Tesla Rifle, but I'm always leery of tricks.  This guy racked up a 300 bounty before he vanished from the server.
---
I tested this once, and I‚Äôm gonna do it again tomorrow, but it seems that it counts different types of plants towards the same goal of 17/hr.
---
Not a terrible excuse, or even an excuse, because that implies that there‚Äôs a problem that needs excusing. You‚Äôre entitled to your opinion obviously, but the idea that people are wrong for tagging legendaries is really odd. It‚Äôs not like the SBQ where they make it harder so there is no problem with them pinging the legendary.
---
One of the items you were given may well have been duped. Make a ticket.
---
The next patch is tomorrow, so the suspension wont be very long.
---
I wouldnt be suprised if you are fine, but 1 of your gifts is missing.
